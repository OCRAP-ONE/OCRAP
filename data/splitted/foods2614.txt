review/summary: Good taste, decent energy
review/text: Pretty good product.  It's a small bottle that tasted good, even not chilled.  The energy kick is a bit less than a small cup of Starbucks coffee, for me at least.  But there is no jitter either.  If you are a caffeine addict, you may need more than one shot.  At $1/bottle it's a good deal as well.

review/summary: Red Rain Energy Shot
review/text: Please pay close attention to the fact that these are only 2 ounces. That is very tiny - one gulp and you are done. The flavor is OK. The product description claims that "When you are feeling run down, lethargic, or just can't seem to concentrate, bring on the Rain! Red Rain Energy Shots!" I would argue that this is a bit of an over-statement. My guess is that the placebo effect of drinking a mysterious liquid from a tiny red bottle is more invigorating than the actual effect of the ingredients on your system.

review/summary: No Extra Energy A Tad More Focus
review/text: I got this for my husband to try out because he works all sorts of terrible hours.  He will close one night to have to open the next morning & then close the next night.  He is always looking for things to help him through these types of shifts.<br /><br />His opinion:<br />2 stars<br />Taste:  not very good (he got the berry flavor)<br />Extra energy:  none<br />Mental clarity:  a little more focused than usual<br />Ingredients:  poor.<br /><br />I am going to give you the ingredients since I didn't see them on the page when I opted to try this (if they are now listing this info I apologize for adding useless info).  By the way, had I known the ingredients I would not have bothered with this product.<br />Total Carbs 2g<br />Niacin (as Niacinamide) 10mg 50% of your daily value<br />Vitamin B6 (as Pyridoxine HCI) 20mg 100% of your daily value<br />Folic Acid 200mcg 50% of your daily value<br />Vitamin B12 (as Cyanocolbalamin) 250mcg 4166% of your daily value (NO that is NOT a typo four thousand sixty sixy percent of your daily value!)<br />Sodium 5mg<br />Energy Blend 1600mg (Taurine, Malic Acid, Glucuronolactone, Caffeine, Choline Chloride, N-Acetly L-Tyrosine)<br />Other Ingredients: water, potassium citrate, natural and artificial flavor, sucralose, potassium benzoate & potassium sorbate (preservatives), caramel color, yellow 5.<br />It also features a CAUTION: Contains caffeine comparable to a cup of the leading premium coffee.  Limit caffeine products to avoid nervousness, sleeplessness, and occasional rapid heartbeat.  You may experience a Niacin Rush (hot feeling, skin redness) that lasts a few minutes.  This is caused by increased blood flow near the skin.  Do not take if you are pregnant or nursing, or under 12 years of age.<br /><br />That's a lot of stuff hu?  Anyway, our favorite for energy so far is the Spot On Energy Patch.  They are really convenient & easy to use.  You stick in on & that's it.  You can get them on Amazon & there are other B patches available that we haven't tried yet.  The link for Spot On is here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CVUYL0  They even have it with the subscribe & save to make it cheaper which is very cool.

review/summary: After taste and more caffeine than  cup of coffee
review/text: Have we become so lazy we need an expensive 2 oz container to give us the healthy energy we can get for much less money, via eating healthy fruits, vegetables and buying a bottle of B Complex vitamins?  As Dr Oz and other medical professionals note, if the label has something on it you cannot pronounce don't buy it.<br /><br />Bear in mind the 2 oz container has 160 mg of caffeine, compared to 1 cup of brewed coffee which has  80-135 mg. Or an Espresso cup which has 100 mg. And coffee is meant to be drunk and enjoyed slower.  I just don't think the 160 in on shot is healthy.<br /><br />As for taste, the berry flavour was akin to some cherry Kool Aid loaded with sugar, with an after taste. Yuck!  And the stuff can make you hyper if you are not a caffeine drinker of any kind be it coffee or soda drinks.

review/summary: Best cheese curls - UPDATED: overpriced and poor quality
review/text: I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag "freshness guaranteed." That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could.

review/summary: Five stars for the cheese flavored puffs
review/text: I'd give it three stars for the approximately 50% of puffs that have little or no cheese on them, and five stars for the ones that have a lot (maybe too much?). I have been eating Michael Seasons puffs and curls for at least two years and can't help but notice how their production has shifted from full-flavored to light-flavored (after which I wrote the company) to mixed-flavored. It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed. Still, because they contain at least partially organic ingredients, and because they taste so well overall, there's no other brand that beats them so I keep ordering anyway.

review/summary: From Awesome to Bland
review/text: My husband and I went Gluten Free earlier this year due to a health condition.  We stumbled across this product at Whole Foods and decided to try it.  These were incredible...  so cheesy and spicy!!!  So much so, we decided to buy a case on Amazon.  Once our original case was depleted, we re-ordered, and though the product looks identical, the new case contained cheese curls with little to no seasoning.  They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.  We opened each bag in the case hoping some of them would be good like the first case we purchased, but to our dismay, we ended up tossing the entire case.  We will not be buying these again.  What a letdown...

Your basketball players don't make every shot, your football players don't make every touch down. Are you whining at them or their coach? No. You deal with it, because despite the flaws, you like them.

May be not only perfect but better than original from Planters. So, there is lot of cheeze powder on it and size is right and it's so delicious that when you'll put one curl in to you mouth you will involuntarily draw the next two.<br /><br />I'll recommend it for everyone who loved old time Planters Cheeze Curls - it's good and probably better.<br /><br />P.S.: I love them so much so I order them to Russia - total cost with delivery is about 75 dollars!

review/text: I found this brand of cheese snacks at a Whole Foods store in Manhattan and I've been hooked ever since. Unfortunately, WF started carrying their own brand of cheese puffs and stopped selling Michael Season's. Thank goodness for Amazon.com!<br /><br />I like these so much that I ordered a case and had them delivered to my office. Now all my office mates are getting hooked. These taste amazing for being "lite", and they have a decent amount of fiber per serving (and relatively low fat/calories). They are all natural, and highly addictive!<br /><br />I've tried the regular variety of Michael Season's Cheese Puffs, and I do not recommend them because they're too rich. The Lite variety taste perfectly cheesey without being too buttery in flavor.<br /><br />Makes an awesome afternoon snack!

review/summary: BEST DOG FOOD FOR YOUNG AND OLDER DOGS
review/text: I was in line at Petsmart and the man in front of me was buying Bil Jac dog food.  That was about 6 years ago. I asked him about it because I had never heard of it.  He happened to be a Scientist who had been on a dog food study team and said it was the best of all they rated.  I have 12 toy poodles  ( I use to breed them) and this dog food they all loved immediately.  The best part is it is the only small kibble I have found that isn't so hard.  I have tried so many of the more expensive, better brands and they always turned their noses up at it, but would eventually, reluctantly, eat it.  Bil Jac crumbles more easily for these little guys. For Picky eaters as well.  It works well with dogs who have teeth problems and older dogs as well as it does not hurt their teeth to break the kibble. In a pinch I have had to buy other food for them and they never like it. The other kind I had to soak in water before feeding them because it was so hard.  I promise your dogs will love this food and it's so good for them too.  I have always  let my dogs "graze" ( I am a big believer of that) and leave food down all the time and they never over eat with this or get fat.  Normal BM's too. Can't say enough good stuff about this dog food. Once your dog gets a taste of this, they will never want another brand! Oh, it is for big dogs too!

And while the peas aren't the greatest, they're not too bad either. But I feel a little ripped-off. I wouldn't have a problem if the can said "wasabi-flavored", but it didn't. The maker obviously wants people to believe that the product is something it's not. I guess "Horseradish Peas" didn't pass muster with their marketing department.

review/text: I keep a can of this poppable snack on my desk to nibble when I need a quick boost of spicy, crunchy goodness.  Just a few, slammed back like popcorn, have enough punch to open my eyes and get my mind back on the work.  The peas themselves have a light flavor, neither bland nor overpowering, that really carries the kick of the wasabi.<br /><br />If I had to muster one complaint, it's the presence of the word "hot" on the can in fire-red letters.  Though these peas are pleasantly spicy, I've had much hotter.  This spice, while tasty, is fairly mild.  So don't purchase this snack expecting it to light up your life.  Just expect it to taste good and keep you going through the long, boring day.

review/text: I went to the nearest Asian mart to buy one of these cans (the shipping price online was too ridiculous!) based on the great reviews here. Maybe I have a high tolerance for really spicy things but these wasabi peas definitely do not give that usual wasabi punch-in-the-face reaction. I first had wasabi peas from one of the delis near my school and those peas really had a kick to them! Not one pea in this can made me do that and the beauty of wasabi is that kick which, well, basically I did not find here. I would not buy these if you want the best value for your money. They also use so much food coloring that the peas look neon green..

review/summary: Excellent Peas, Very Hot, Do Not Serve to Newborn Babies
review/text: Hapi's Hot Wasabi Green Peas are a terrific replacement for granola! I eat a bowlful every morning with ketchup, green tea and scallions. Yummy! I tried rolling up the peas in an omlet and served it to my wife on our 75th anniversary. This was just my way of expressing my affection for her. Somehow she missed my sincere intentions and barfed all over my grandmother's antique quilt. Then our Irish Wolfhound jumped up on the bed, licked up the disgusting mess and yelped so loud that 3 of my goldfish jumped out of their bowl and were eaten by my cat. At least someone got a good meal from all my hard work.<br /><br />I had some small success passing out single peas to the neighborhood kids, telling them that they were a new flavor of M&Ms. Their parents really have no gripe with me, but I explained it all to the police. They could not find any violation of law, so I was released without charges.<br /><br />I did feel a bit ripped off by the 9.9 oz. packaging as I had expected a full 10 oz. bottle. After carefully counting all the peas I determined that 4 additional peas would make up the missing 1/10 ounce (yes, I did the math). So I called customer service, told them how unhappy I was and asked them to send me 4 additional peas. She was polite, but said no, claiming that they wouldn't have a pod to pea in. Whatever. These are really nice peas -- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

review/summary: Are you ready for the really hot stuff?
review/text: There is a fine line in the love of hot sauces.  On one side of this line is the enjoyment of great tasting hot sauces shared with friends and family who also enjoy spicy food, sometimes with a good laugh at some remarkable heat.  On the other side of this line lies a realm where the great pleasures of hot sauce are intertwined with exquisite pain.<br /><br />This sauce is a good litmus test for those who are wondering if they are capable of crossing this line.  There are much, much hotter sauces out there, but you should start with a sauce like this one first.<br /><br />This sauce is not just about heat though.  It truly has a great flavor for those who can taste it over the heat.  This is a good sauce for experienced very-hot sauce afficionados.<br /><br />I highly recommend this sauce IF and only IF you are either accustomed to very hot sauces, or are looking for a good sauce to begin exploring extreme hot sauces.  If you match either of these then you will love this sauce.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: After training my taste buds on various other ultra-hot sauces, I decided to give this one a try.  According to the label, it is lab tested at 135,600 Scoville Units.  Some of the other sauces I tried were supposedly several hundred thousand SHU up to about 3 million, so I wasn't expecting this sauce to be all that hot.  I am now convinced that a "lab tested" Scoville Unit is worth at least ten of the other kind.  I also love the flavor and consistency.  Some sauces are too thick and pasty and are hard to apply in controlled amounts, but this sauce is easy to pour out drop-by-drop to get just the right amount.

review/summary: MORE than beyond insane.........!!
review/text: Just to let you know, I would not try this stuff myself.  So I can only tell you what my nephew in Missouri told me when I sent it to him.  He said he touched a small amount to his tongue and over an hour later, his tongue was still numb!  But since he's gotten familiar with using it in the right quantity, he is joyous over it.  Obviously, he is more in love with pain than most.  He cooks quite a bit and uses an assortment of very spicy concoctions.  He said this flavor (sparingly), is quite good for a hot sauce.  So you'd better have a very LARGE pain threshold should you care to try this one.

review/summary: Decent, tastes like strawberry
review/text: I've been looking for new and interesting candy to try. The reviewer who said that this tastes like strawberry is right; it's just perhaps a tiny bit more sour. That said, the candies are good. They're individually wrapped in clear plastic with printed white text. You get about 24 of them in a bag.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is because of how similar it is to strawberry candy. Aside from curiosity and the luxury of imported candies, you may as well just get domestic strawberry candy instead.<br /><br />Update: I've changed this review to five stars, and here's why: I had given out some candies to people to try, but I didn't really stick around while they ate them, OR I was eating the candy myself, and I missed out on the most unusual, unique, and wonderful thing about this candy.<br /><br />This candy makes you smell wonderful. You can't smell it if you eat it, though. The smell is strong but incredibly pleasant. It's also hard for people to pin down-- fruity, sugary perfume, or fruity, sugary food? Now my coworkers have a running joke that whenever someone eats a lychee candy, they're obligated to breathe on everyone else. Not that they need to-- since one or two people eating this candy will fill a whole room with "W, what smells wonderful?! What is that??"<br /><br />So if you want to attract people, literally, eat this candy. It's become my favorite and signature sweet, and everyone wants one as soon as they know I've gotten a package in.

I was a little disappointed because I was hoping for something more exotic and haven't had lychee before, but I guess their flavor is very light. The outside of the candy was a little chewy and stuck to the wrapper, but otherwise was very good. Worth a try, especially for those not very adventurous with foreign foods.

All of the Kosugai product are very high quality, the flavors are incredibly juicy and true to life, mainly because the actual fruit is a main ingredient, but its not anything like those 'fruit leathers' this is an actual candy, it is the closest thing to eating the actual fruit as it gets in terms of juiciness and flavor. I buy these all the time now, I love all the flavors, particularly the Mangosteen, Lychee, kiwi, and strawberry.

review/text: When I was young (after WWII) coffee and chicory essense was all one could get.  It had a great taste. Recently I discovered that this mix originated in South India and was introduced to France via the French Colony there.  Chicory gives a 'chocolate tinge' to the flavor and assists the coffee to take up more water.  Made in the cold press manner,see my review of the Hario Mizudashi Cold Brew product, the result is smooth, nonbitter coffee ecstacy.  This product, perfectly granulated, is ideal for brewing this way.  Hooray for Frontier Natural Chicory!

review/summary: Heat Overpowers the Taste
review/text: I have been a huge fan of salsa for more than twenty years. Every trip I make to Kansas City to see my oldest daughter, she takes me to the factory outlet store for Original Juan (which manufactures and distributes a number of salsas under a variety of names, including Da'Bomb).<br /><br />My credo has always been "the hotter, the better." I never buy mild salsa, and rarely buy medium. When I saw Da'Bomb on one of my recent trips, I purchased a bottle. The naga jolokia (or "ghost pepper"), which is used in this salsa, measures more than one million Scoville units. By comparison, a jalapeno has no more than 8,000. So this salsa is definitely hot.<br /><br />However, for me, the heat overpowered the taste. With the first bite it was like having a mouthful of fire ants. I usually go through a jar a salsa in a week, but this was in my fridge for two months before I used it up. Maybe I'm getting wimpier as I get older, but I will not be buying this again.

review/text: I have been purchasing Flavigny's Violet Pastilles for more than 30 years.  They are hard to find, so I'm glad I could find them online.  Whenever I come across them, I always get some for my brother and now for both my sons.  I take them to work with me and when I offer them to co-workers, they always ask me where I get them!  A nice conversation starter and friend maker.

review/summary: Delicious, but strange
review/text: These are quite different from the C Howard's violet mints I've eaten before, in many ways.  The taste was subtler and sweeter, and the candy itself was letter made, as to be expected from a product like this.  For those of you that don't know how these are made, they are Anise seeds(delicious seeds, somewhat similar to fennel) rolled in sugar and violet extract to create a pearl-like ball of sugar with anise flavor at its center.  Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste - the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the breath for a while after.  These left me with the slightly unpleasant feeling that I had just eaten a flower, stem and all.  Still, they have a delicious, very purple taste.  Also, shipping was excellent, they came 2 days before the stated arrival time and were packaged well.  The tin they come in is also quite nice.

review/summary: Great food for preventative oral care
review/text: As a dog owner, I try to do the best for my dog.  My mother is a veterinarian technician and strongly recommend that I take good care of my dog's teeth.  Based on her job, she had plenty of stories about dogs with terrible teeth and told me that I should either feed my dog an oral care food or brush her (my dog's) teeth daily.  Knowing that I wouldn't want to brush my teeth and that my dog wasn't going to like it, I opted for the oral care science diet.  My mother recommends the Hills Prescription Diet TD (prescription oral care), but said that the oral care is also acceptable since it is available without a prescription.  I have been feeding this to my dog for 3 years (since she was a puppy) and her teeth are very clean and white.  I rest happily knowing that I won't be dealing with a vet recommending that I pay a huge amount of money to rip out teeth or put my dog under to get a teeth cleaning (these procedures can run into the thousands of dollars in some severe cases).  Over all, the food is more expensive than other foods, but the benefit of knowing that my dog's teeth are well cared for is worth it to me because I know how expensive the alternative can be.  Another added bonus- my dog likes this food!

review/summary: Great mix for my dogs dinner!
review/text: So we love this product.  We mix is about 1/3 of this with his other dog food (Blue Buffalo).  Our dog builds up a lot of tarter on his teeth, and this really helps clean his teeth in addition to brushing and greenies.  As this product is a bit pricey we mix it in with 2/3 other dog food (which is also pricey lol).  I think its works great on its own or as a mix.  The dog really looks for the bigger bites and I think encourages him to eat more.  He is not picky but really doesn't eat a lot.  I order online and have gotten free shipping sometimes.

review/summary: DOES A GREAT JOB ON THEIR GUMS & DOGS LOVE IT
review/text: I bought this for my two four year old dogs (a miniature poodle and a Lhasa Apso) when I discovered their gums were inflammed and had the beginnings of gum disease.  At first I was alarmed when I got the bag because the food chucks are rather large for my small dogs, however I remembered it is probably them chewing on it that will remove the tartar.  Sure enough they love these mini golf ball size food.<br /><br />It helps their gum problems and it's cute to see them grab one out of the dish and run into the living room with it like they have a prize.  I have a two sided bowl and put this in one side and the mini food bits in the other and they prefer this food.<br /><br />I still offer them both.<br /><br />I highly recommend,

review/summary: Clean Teeth!!!
review/text: I have tried everything to clean my large dog's teeth.  She is 5 and I want to stay on top of it.  We wrestled with a toothbrush and chicken toothpaste, went on a drinking strike when I added enzymes to her water and finally, refused to open her mouth for the glove with little brushes built in.  She does not love the taste of this food but I give it to her at night with a 1/2 can alpo so the gravy coats it and her teeth look great.  Finally a solution to a huge problem with older dogs and cats (there is a cat food too).  Thanks to my friend Ida who has been buying it from her vet at a much higher price and recommended it to me.

review/summary: Great for Bad Breath
review/text: Yes, my dog suffers from bad breath.  Her favorite food is cat poop, followed by deer, cow and turkey poop, so after I let her back in the house I give her a piece or two of Oral Care.  I have trained her to believe she's getting a treat, not a breath freshener/tartar cleaner.  She'll do anything for them, and they really work, otherwise she'd never again get petted.  I trained a friend's dog to also believe they are treats.  He'll sit and catch them out of the air as they fly towards him - don't really want to get too close to that bad breath slobbery mouth stuff.

review/text: I switched to this cat food randomly--Whole Foods was out of the Halo brand cat food I had been buying, and this was the next best option they sold.  I'm really glad I switched though! My 2 cats used to vomit up their food once or twice a week, and never liked the Halo brand food.  The vomiting is way down now, and they both seem to really like this food.  Plus the quality of this cat food is great, which is something I really care about.<br /><br />This 12 lb bag is a great deal.  At whole foods, it's $14 for a 3lb bag!  With the 12 lb bag, I save $22.  Plus with Amazon Prime the shipping was free, so it works out great (even if I paid for shipping though it'd still be saving me money).<br /><br />I really like this food for my cats, and plan to keep using it.

review/summary: Expensive - But great food
review/text: I'm usually the type of person to buy whatever is on sale to give to her cats. But about a year ago my sister had a health scare with her animals and they kept throwing up while eating Purina. We did a lot of research together and learned about the types of food you really SHOULD be giving your cats. Apparently most cat food has main ingredients that would not normally be found in a cat's diet (always check the first three, those tell what the majority of food is made of.) Things like corn and grain are not good for kitties, and they...well to be frank...they eat more, they poop more, and when they DO poop, it's waaaaayyy stinky.<br /><br />A lot of people recommended a variety of brands, and this was one that was actually on the cheaper end, but still had better ingredients. My kitties LOVE it (they love the Wellness in the brown and cream bag more, but this is cheaper.) They eat less cat food and seem to be more satisfied. I calculated how long it takes them to go through a large bag like this versus the cost of it. It costs me about (or a little over) 50 cents a day to feed two kitties. All the protein in it keeps them more full so they eat less of it! I'd say that's not a bad deal. The pieces are pretty small so it's easy for them to chew on. (Sometimes I get kinds that literally would be the size for a smallish dog and not a cat. They have problems eating it and the pieces fall everywhere.)<br /><br />I will continue to buy this kind as long as it remains available.

review/summary: An excellent, high-quality food
review/text: This is an excellent, high-quality cat food. If you want to change to this -- just be aware that anytime you change your cat's food, you have to do so very gradually over about a week's time, mixing the new with the old in gradually increasing amounts. Never just switch from one food to another, or you are asking for stomach upsets. The people who make this food actually recommend feeding a mix of dry kibbles with the canned food, which is how I feed it. I have three Manx cats that I have switched over to this food and they are doing extremely well. Their coats have improved and they have more energy. One of my boys has lost weight on their low-calorie formula and he looks great. My female has stopped scratching herself and her fur has grown back where she licked it off -- I think she had food allergy issues with her old food. My other boy has issues with struvites and was on a prescription diet from the vet. However, the manufacturer even said he couldn't stay on it forever without constant blood testing because it could harm his kidneys! Who wants to feed their cat something that could harm his kidneys?? So far, after several months on Wellness, he's doing great. Their food keeps the Ph of the urine low, which is great for a cat with his problems. So many of the store bought foods are literally full of garbage -- rejected stuff that would be thrown away. Meat by-products contain some pretty horrible stuff. Also, cats are carnivores and need meat -- not cereal, which is a main ingredient in many cat foods. When's the last time you saw a cat in the wild eating corn or meal? Wellness has human grade meat as its main ingredient and also contains healthy veggies.  My two boys are on the Lite formula and my girl is on Adult Super5 Mix. I'm glad a friend told me about it. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Gonna be a lifetime customer!
review/text: I adopted my boy kitty (Boo) about a year and half ago and my girl kitty (Poxie) one and half months ago from the local pound. They both had a clean bill of health without any allergies or problems (other than the occasional hairball) but I started them on this brand after some reasearch because I wasn't happy about the nasties in the old food and how it left dye all around the water bowl (Boo = messy eater, he likes to pick out his food and it ends up all over the place).<br /><br />After a couple months of changing Boo's food, there was less bits of food being flung around and floating in his bowl, there wasn't a brown ring around his drinking fountain and there was even less fur in his foutain (granted, the latter may have more to do with the seasons and shedding).<br /><br />When I took Boo back to the vet about 6 months after changing the food, the Dr. mentioned that he was a bit iffy because it was werid to have fruit in cat food. He also said that he's noticed several cats that have kidney problems after years of eating Wellness (and checked to see if I was feeding them wet food as well - they eat Nutro Max pouches too. However, throughout the whole exam, he commented several times on how Boo's fur was very shiney, full and didn't have any flakes or dandruff like some of the other black cats he's seen.  At the end the Dr., somewhat jokeingly, said "Ok, if his coat is THIS nice, I have to look into this some more and change my mind about the brand!"<br /><br />Poxie was a scruffy looking girl and spent a couple months at the pound before we adopted her. She had just given birth to kittens before being placed for adoption and was spayed ASAP. She had her own room and didn't have to fight for food while at the pound, but she was on the thin side and her fur was dry and had a brittle feeling. She's been eating Wellness for about three weeks now and her coat has already settled down and is more sleek and silkier.<br /><br />So overall, notciable changes in both their coats (as a general indication of their health) and a huge improvement quality/ingredient wise compared to what they were fed at the pound. I have been recommending Wellness to everybody who askes me about my kitties!

review/text: My cats have sampled almost every healthy food available in the U.S.A., and all 4 of them will eat this one! Before I learned about feline nutrition, I fed my cats dry food and poor quality canned food. Now they won't eat any good quality canned food, or raw diet, and they are addicted to dry food. I still feed them Fancy Feast canned food (it's the only wet food they will eat) and I am happy that I found a good quality dry food that they will eat! I've offered 4 different premium quality dry foods side by side, and the cats prefer this one! They won't touch most healthy foods, so Wellness must have a palatable formula. I recommend this food to anyone with a cat who insists on eating dry food and is finicky!

review/summary: Worth the expense!
review/text: Moses, my 8 year old cat, was having trouble with itching, dandruff, and excessive earwax accumulating in his ears.  His vet suggested that allergies might be the culprit, so before spending hundreds of dollars on allergy testing, she suggested that I switch him to a premium diet (grain-free, if possible).  Switching from a diet of Fancy Feast (aka Kitty Crack) and Friskies was no easy task! He refused to eat Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and a few other brands of dry food.  For some unknown reason, he's taken a liking to his Wellness Complete Health! It does have a meaty, natural smell and feels slightly oily to the touch.<br /><br />His coat is much shinier, he's dandruff free, and his earwax problem has improved by about 30%.  On the downside, he's gained weight.  My vet said that this food is higher in calories than most other brands, so you'll want to be sure your cat isn't overeating.  Also, I've found that if Moses's diet isn't supplemented with wet food, he gets constipated (which was diagnosed by the tiny balls of poop that stick to his butt or end up around the house).  This was never a problem before he started eating this brand, so beware.

review/summary: Litter box smell could gag a skunk
review/text: Switched my non-diabetic (I have one diabetic on wet only for the past year) cat from EVO to Wellness Complete (blue bag) in an attempt to save $ while still providing good nutrition for the fur baby. Ever since starting the Wellness food his litter box has had the most foul odor I have ever smelled in a litter box. Visitors can definitely tell I have pets!! Heck, they probably think I'm secretly hoarding zoo animals. This hasn't been a problem before and I had really been hoping this was a temporary thing but we're almost three months into a bag and there's been no let up. We're finally getting to the last of the bag and I'm going to start switching him back to the EVO because I literally can't take it anymore. I'm quite frankly shocked that no one else has complained about this.<br /><br />To summarize:<br /><br />PROs:<br />Pretty solid nutrition<br />Cat seems to really like the taste<br />Cheaper than other holistic brands<br /><br />CONs:<br />Twice a day it smells like raw sewage all through-out my house.

review/summary: My cats eat it...begrudgingly
review/text: As with anything, one cat's trash is another cat's treasure (or something like that).  I have been experimenting with various canned and dry cat foods for my 2 cats (one is a 9 month old kitten and the other is a 3 year old).  They're generally not picky eaters, but when I decided a few months ago to switch them from Purina Indoor Cat food and Purina One Kitten Chow to higher quality cat foods, I did a considerable amount of research.<br /><br />I started them off with Evo Turkey & Chicken food, which they seemed to love at first.  At some point after I opened the second bag of Evo, they started to turn their noses up at meal time.  Not only that, I also noticed what some other Evo reviewers have said: that their breath and poo were very stinky.  My kitten loves to cuddle and my acute sense of smell just made that experience unbearable, to say nothing of litter duty.<br /><br />So onward to other options.  I figured I'd try the other highly touted Wellness brand.  Perhaps I should have predicted that they would hate this brand cat food since I had previously bought Wellness cat treats, which they will.not.eat.  I mean, they don't refuse much, but they refuse those treats.  But, since I wanted to stick with a high quality brand, I decided to try Wellness.  My cats eat it, but only do so begrudgingly and it's clear they do not enjoy it.  I have had to resort to mixing in canned food to make it more palatable until the bag is finished.  Oh, and their breath is still nauseating -- a different kind than with Evo, but still very noticeable.<br /><br />I suppose it's just as well; I was planning to switch them to canned food eventually, which they love.  The problem now is that I will have to start another hunt for the right canned food because I can't tell if the options I'm offering now are just being devoured because they actually like the flavor or if it's just better than the Wellness.<br /><br />Bottom line: as with any new pet foods, buy a small quantity before committing to it.  Especially when you're paying a premium.

review/summary: Made Cat Sick, Cost $200 to Fix, Company Wouldn't Reimburse
review/text: I purchased a bag of WellPet's Wellness Complete Health (blue bag) dry cat food at a local pet store.  I wanted to bring my experience to your customer's attention so that others won't have the same problem.  The food caused my cat to have a serious urinary tract infection that required a vet visit and special food to cure.  The total cost to me in out of pocket un-reimbursed expenses was close to $200.  I contacted Well Pet several times to request reimbursement, but they ultimately refused even though my Vet told me that the food was likely the cause of the problem.  Please advise other customers of this potential problem so they don't waste their time and money on the product, or cause their pet to become painfully sick.

review/summary: LOVE IT, but $26 for 14-ounces?
review/text: I would love to buy this product from you, it's my cats favorite food. However, I don't agree with the price, $26 for 14-ounces is a bit expensive, don't you think?  I'd love to buy a 14-pound bag for $26 as the product is well worth that price.

review/text: The taste for this product was horrible. I don't know if Kangaroos are supposed to taste bad but this was just... nasty. They shipped pretty fast though, and gave me Bacon Gravy for free so... I can't complain. I wanted to try it and I did.

review/summary: The best tuna
review/text: Glad to find Polar tuna on Amazon; it's becoming harder and harder to find it in a supermarket.  The best canned tuna I've eaten.  It's almost all solid pieces, not the usual canful of mush you get from other brands of "solid" tuna.  And it doesn't have the usual nasty aftertaste of fish and tin.

review/summary: WRONG PICTURE > Normal Can... needs opener
review/text: I am a huge fan of POLAR TUNA thus 5 stars.  The can does NOT have a pull-tab! I ordered these for convenient lunches on the quick. As I order the regular cans by the large case these would supplement my pantry for grab and go convenience. NOT SO! Just paid more for the same tuna I could have purchased when I renew my regular case.

review/summary: More is now less
review/text: I have been a Polar Tuna customer for about four years now.  Polar is by far superior than any other brand you can buy.  Until recently I was on the automatic reorder program for my Polar with Amazon, and for $38.00 a case for 24 cans that was truely a great deal.  Then a couple of months ago Amazon informed me that they were cancelling that program.  I was very disappointed.  I contacted Polar (who were kind enough to respond to me almost immediately) and Amazon and was told that there was a problem between Amazon and Polar but they hoped to resolve the issue and once again start selling Polar on Amazon.  Keep in mind that I have told many people about this Polar product and they also were buying it from Amazon. Well sure enough last month Polar was now available from Amazon again but now it was a bit higher in price, $8 dollars a case more but still with free shipping.  Still a great deal.  I ordered two cases which arrived promptly and stacked them on the shelf.  Now for those of you who have never opened a can of Polar let me explain that when you open a can and squeeze out the water the lid barely compresses, I mean the water comes out but the lid barely moves and when you remove it whats inside is a can full of tuna not this mush you get with other brands.  I'm sorry to say that thats  not the case with the Polar I recent recieved.  There is definately more water and less tuna now in the cans.  The lid compresses much further down in the can, more water comes out and the huge chunk of tuna left inside the can is now more chunks instead of a huge chunk of tuna. I'm sure there is still six ounces inside the can, but the ratio of tuna to water is definately less tuna and more water.  Still a bargain but not the great deal it use to be.  I realize that every food manufacturer is doing it with their products but it is a big dissappointement to me that it has happened with Polar, just another example of greed and giving the consumer less for their money.

review/summary: Simply the best tuna ever
review/text: Best tuna I've ever tasted & I don't think I would ever eat another brand again.<br />Polar tuna is one of the very few all natural tuna products and they stayed 6oz while most of the other brands secretly downsized to 5oz. I introduced this tuna to all my family members and friends. Now all of them are hooked on this item!

review/summary: EXCELLENT - FAR BETTER THAN STARKIST, CHICKEN OF THE SEA, OR  BUMBLEBEE
review/text: I discovered Polar tuna on Amazon, and I have placed my second order.  It's just like the tuna I remembered from the 1960's - solid pieces - and not the poor quality can of mush that you can expect today from  Starkist, Chicken-of-the-Sea, and  Bumblebee.<br /><br />I was so put off by the poor quality of tuna from the major brands that I searched and searched online to see if quality tuna was still available anywhere.  And I'm glad I did. -  I bought the pouches the first time.  But they weren't available when I placed my second order, so I bought cans this time.  Both have proven to be exceptionally excellent!  I will be ordering more - and hopefully the excellent people at Polar will keep providing this great product.

(Another brand of tuna I bought as a case lot came with an expiration date of this year; fortunately, I managed to use it up.)<br /><br />I hope the Polar tuna continues to be available.

review/summary: Bad aftertaste
review/text: I have always bought and loved the clean "fresh tuna" tasting firm meat Polar Tuna when I bought it in my grocers.  But I purchased this product from Amazon in March 2010, and was very disappointed.  Although it looks firm and solid, (and the expiration date is for next November), it smells different, not that "fresh tuna" smell it used to have.  It also has that sharp bitter "bad tuna" aftertaste that most tuna seems to have for the last 5 or more years.  This bad aftertaste seems to coincide with the various preservatives they have added to tuna.  But on the can, this tuna says it only is "Albacore, water, salt. Product of Thailand".  If there is only water salt and tuna, then this tuna is bad. In the old days when I bought Polar tuna in the store, if I put the can in the trash, or left the dish on the counter for a few hours till I filled the dishwasher, it just smelled like fresh tuna smell.  But as soon as the can is opened from this 24 pack, the smell is bad, and it gets worse quickly.  As a last resort to see if something could remove the bad taste, I even tried cooking one can in tomato sauce, and I could still taste the bad tuna taste.<br /><br />I am disappointed, not only because of how it used to be so good, but also on the can it says: All Natural, NO ADDITIVES, NO RESIDUE, NO AFTERTASTE, and that is just not true.<br /><br />I have contacted them by email, and if they get back to me I will update this review.
