review/summary: the perfect snack
review/text: I go to the store and cannot find a good, organic,low fat, pop tart.  When I found the blueberry at Amazon.com I was thrilled.  Buying them by the case is also super.  I keep them on hand for snacks with coffee which I adore.  You will never find a better treat that is so healthy and great tasting.

review/summary: Very Balanced Flavored Almonds
review/text: I am a fan of Blue Diamond Almonds "Bold" series, and the Habanero BBQ flavor is my favorite.  I have tried two other flavors (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Wasabi Soy), but these are the most balanced.  The habanero packs sufficient heat without being overpowering or painful.  I like "hot" flavored things for the taste rather than to experience pain or burning.  The heat is balanced with the sweetness of the BBQ.  As a bonus to the great taste, you also have almonds which are one of the healthier snacks.  The bold flavor helps guard against overindulgence too.  I like to keep them around the house and grab a handful between meals when hunger strikes.  If you like spicy and sweet flavor and almonds, give these a try.

review/summary: Great taste but not as spicy as I expected!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack. This is a good flavor and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a hint of Habanero and BBQ.  I did expect these to be spicier and I was surprised when they just tasted good but without the hit of hot spice that I was expecting. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 2 grams of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 4% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.

review/summary: Not much Habanero in these nuts
review/text: Actually, the BBQ flavoring isn't much to speak of either. There really is nothing here to get excited about at all except plenty of sodium.<br /><br />I love snacking on almonds and in their natural state are a fairly healthy snack option. I should have known better since I am supposed to watch the sodium, but since I love all things spicy, I covered my eyes and ignored the back label and threw them in my cart at the big warehouse store. These are rather bland and I prefer the original smokehouse flavor, or better yet buying them raw and avoiding the sodium all together (you'd be surprised how tasty they are).

review/summary: Fresh, tasty, cooks great!
review/text: My wife and I have been eating red quinoa for years instead of rice, and love its nutty taste.  In 2011, the price of quinoa has soared with its popularity, and our local grocery stores have run out of the red variant.  So I bought some online, a bit wary after reading the negative review.<br /><br />However, the quality of Roland red quinoa seems better and fresher than what we had been getting in local stores.  There are fewer white grains, the germ spirals out more consistently, and it tastes great!  We cook quinoa in broth using the "Quick Cook" mode on our Zojirushi rice cooker, and it consistently comes out great.<br /><br />If you're a fan of red quinoa (and you must be to consider buying 10 pounds of it!), this Roland Red is a great way to get it.

review/text: The flavor of Roland's red quinoa is comparable to the flavor of white quinoa as the flavor of wild rice is comparable to the flavor of brown rice. Otherwise, they are the same. There is a little dust and stem matter in it though, despite that it is pre-rinsed. The resealable bag is very convenient. Overall, I recommend it despite the impurities, but will not buy it again because I actually prefer the mellow flavor of white quinoa.

I'll definitely buy again, though I might try the Roland Black Quinoa to change it up!

review/summary: Old Quinoa?
review/text: Perhaps I'm just showing my ignorance where this product is concerned but I am sorely disappointed in it.  I've cooked white quinoa with no problem but this product doesn't cook the same way.  No matter how long I cook it, or how long I soak it before I cook it, all I get are hot red round beads of quinoa.  I bought four bags of this and spent a small fortune so we'll eat hot red round beads of quinoa until all 20 pounds of it are gone.  Don't buy this product unless you're excited about hot red round beads of quinoa.  For those unfamiliar, quinoa is supposed to puff up and absorb the liquid it is cooked in, kind of like rice.  This quinoa must be old or something because only about every tenth seed does what it is supposed to.  There is no difference in taste that I can tell between red and white quinoa so save the extra money they want for the different color and buy the cheaper white product, which I found on the shelf of our local members only big box store for 1/2 the price!

review/summary: Gentlease has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula
review/text: A good way to start shopping for this product is to call Enfamil to see their current pricing, keeping in mind any differences in can size and number of cans in a case. I have purchased this product through Enfamil, Amazon and a few other places, always taking advantage of the best deals. I have purchased Gentlease in different size single cans as well as by the case.  I'm still using it with my twins.<br /><br />Next... The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age. But here in the U.S. after your 3 months maternity leave, are you able to pump enough and store in a refrigerator at work? And you might need formula anyway as we do. I mention this because some imply their formula is as good as human breast milk.<br /><br />We're blessed with twins. They started out colicky and we found that Nutramigen worked at that time. They got through that phase and we've been using Gentlease and solids. After they're a year old it will be all solids. Our pediatrician recommended Gentlease. It has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula.<br /><br />I really researched formulas. There are even organizations promoting the sale of human breast milk and there are organizations wanting to stop the sale of human breast milk for fear of health hazards that the FDA cannot control. No matter, those offering breast milk do so at prohibitively high prices - nothing charitable about it.<br /><br />All the brands that I've seen have DHA and ARA, nutrients found in breast milk that promote brain and eye development, iron which is necessary for growth and many more ingredients. The government requires them to have certain ingredients. The major brands do not seem highly differentiated to me except for their specialy models. Gentlease is one of those.<br /><br />Gentlease is one of the special formulas because it has a much lower amount of lactose as well as broken down proteins to make it easier to digest.<br /><br />The prices vary and so do the size of the cans and the number of cans in a case. Unfortunately, I haven't seen Gentlease in big cans at the big box stores. One can also check at the local pharmacy or grocery store for comparison purposes. Keep an eye out for coupons too. You've got to keep constant watch for the best price, and there have been times when the Amazon price prevails.

review/summary: Not a children's flavor
review/text: The Ginger Flavor of the Beyond Gourmet Jelly Bean is as unique as regular jelly beans are bland.<br /><br />It begins with a spicy ginger flavor, definitely not a kids flavor. The flavor intensifies as it remains in your mouth, eventually subsiding to a gingerbread cookie flavor, the crisp ones you drink with milk. I particularly enjoyed spacing these with sweeter fruit flavors, and suggest that you might want to consider trying them first in an assortment.<br /><br />However, if you really love ginger, this single flavor would play out well in a bowl on your desk at work, where you can grab one for a pick me up of flavor. I use the word ONE specifically, because one of these will satisfy your ginger desire, you don't need a handful.<br /><br />I originally received a complimentary sampler of these beans to review, but have been enjoying many of the flavors independently, because they are so unique! I'm only giving this one four stars because they were a bit overpowering for me, however that may be exactly what you are looking for. The all-natural flavorings and colorings are a prime reason why I am especially enjoying these beans, since I have allergies to the additives in some foods.

review/summary: Citrus is probably the best flavor, but not at this price
review/text: I discovered Mash one night at a convenience store. I gave it a shot because it was relatively low in sugar compared to some of my other choices. Nothing could prepare me for how much I would enjoy it. With a flavor slightly reminiscent of Orangina, it combines the zest of the labeled fruit, with a light amount of sweetener, and crisp carbonation. It's refreshing and, best of all, only cost $1.50 before tax at my local convenience mart, so I was a bit floored when Amazon's vendor decided to charge $3.25/bottle through Amazon. For those prices, I could go down the street and buy out the local shop's complete supply of Mash at a handsome profit to the store owner and 50% savings for myself. Maybe that's the intent.

review/text: Where, oh where can you find a tea strainer that doesn't leak?  These Tuffy Steepers are cute, look practical and easy to use, but they fail at their basic purpose...straining the tea and keeping leafs out of the brew.  They collapse into easily transportable shapes, come with a little lid that serves as a base for the hot, wet strainer when finished, they're dishwasher safe...but they don't keep the loose tea out of the brew!  Infuriating.  Plus, they're awful big and take up a lot of room in the cup, so when you remove the steeper, you're left with a 1/2 cup of tea.  One other thing, there's a funky clip that you can see in the pictures.  It's a small plastic thing that extends out over the steeper, for what purpose I can't tell.  It might have been better designed where it repositioned to extend out and down, so you could clip it over the rim of the cup to steady the thing.  I was disappointed by these.  Great looks, little function.  My hunt continues.

review/summary: Great Tea Infuser!
review/text: I love brewing loose leaf tea, except for the bits of tea leaves that inevitably end up in the bottom of my tea cup!  I have bought so many tea infusers hoping to find one that keeps the sediment to a minimum.  I might have found that with the TeaSpot Tuffy Steeper.  This is such a great idea!  I love the fact that you can collapse it to make it easier to carry with you.  It comes with a lid to cover the infuser while the tea is steeping, keeping the tea nice and hot.  The holes in the infuser are so small!  If you use a good quality loose leaf tea, I don't think you will have any problem with bits of tea leaves getting through.  The little handle on top is kind of odd.  I am not sure why it doesn't go the other way but you can use it to pick the infuser up out of the tea when you are done brewing.  It does displace a lot of water, so fill your cup up as much as you can while the infuser is in the cup.  The shape does allow the tea leaves to open up during the steeping process which gives you a great cup of tea.  Love it! Will use it all the time!

This method makes these prices unbeatable!!!<br /><br />Okay the spice itself:  it is good.  Not great, but not a problem at all.  It's considerably milder than McCormick's.  So, to compensate, depending on what I'm making, I simply modify the quantity of spice.  I use about 50% more of this than I would with McCormick's PP Spice.  In any case, this brand is so inexpensive, it's still a good bargain.  And the flavor is great!!!  Just know that it is a little bit mild, and it will work great for you!

review/text: This is a great product and I am glad it is sold in America. If you don't have a croatian/european market nearby you that sells this, then by all means buy it. Otherwise, I would recommend picking it up yourself b/c shipping is a bit pricey (understandably though as it is heavy & breakable).<br /><br />Basically, it is a white chocolate spread and a chocolate-hazelnut (nutella-like) spread.

review/summary: fine soft drink--in great packaging, too !!!
review/text: Sprite lemon lime soda has always been popular; and there's no secret why. Sprite is a very refreshing soft drink with good carbonation that quenches your thirst no matter what! Now this awesome beverage comes in "fridge packs;" these thin cardboard containers have a dozen 12 ounce cans of Sprite in them. The cardboard pack even has a handy built in handle for you to carry them almost effortlessly!<br /><br />The idea of drinking Sprite in cans means that the soda doesn't loose its carbonation as it would if you bought a large bottle of soda. Each can remains completely fresh to the moment you open it to drink it. As for the "fridge pack;" you can load the cardboard pack into the fridge and just reach into it when you want a can of Sprite; and people like this. You can also remove the cans from the pack, of course, and then place the individual cans themselves into your refrigerator.<br /><br />As always, if sugar or any other ingredient listed on the nutrition label is a health issue for you, then please discuss this with your doctor before choosing whether or not to drink Sprite. The nutrition facts label can easily be found on the outside of the thin cardboard container that they call the actual "fridge pack." In addition, drink this soda before the expiration date stamped on one of the ends of the "fridge pack."<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderfully refreshing soft drink that many people enjoy for many good reasons. It is particularly refreshing with a hot meal or on a hot summer's day when you've been working outside. The "fridge pack" makes it easier than ever before to store the individual cans of Sprite in your refrigerator.<br /><br />Thank you, Sprite!!!

review/summary: Low Calorie Large beats Dentastix
review/text: My dog loves this treat and I like it better than the Pedigree Dentastix. I'm comparing the two products to each other because they look so similar in color, size, shape. But my dog will tell you that the texture is definitely different. The Zoe appears tougher and chewier. It last minutes longer than the Dentastix per serving. My dog will sit and take his time to chew through the Zoe chew stix, which I like. Compared to the Pedigree stuff I get from my local Target which seems to disappear in his mouth and he's begging again after just a few seconds. The manufacturer's feeding directions says to feed two sticks a day. The calorie count is 90 per stick. I can't recommend that to your pet. I'm going to give this as a once a week treat, alternating with other stuff since my cocker is prone to getting fat. Unlike Dentastix, this does not indicate any dental health benefits. Still, this is made of quinoa and is gluten free, in case you care about that stuff. Cute packaging and is conveniently resealable. I would buy again and recommend to others.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have bought this again since my dog loves it so much. The second package I got, I actually decided to count houw many sticks came in one bag. There are only 6 if you get the large size like I do. 6 stick for $6. They tell you to give one or two sticks a day. Nevermind the calories (90 per stick)... but one bag might not even last you a week if you follow manufacturer's directions. Kind of pricey at $1 per stick. Greenies on Amazon (regular size) are less expensive. Anyway, I still think that this is a great product and I would still buy it... but believe me, I will be buying less often and only give it to my dogs on special ocassions!

review/summary: Unfortunately caused an allergy to my poochie
review/text: This treat did not have good reaction with my Jack Russell terrier mix, he ate it fine and even enjoyed it, but then he suddenly became quite hyper and nervous like he was having caffeine shakes.  I definitely will not be feeding this to him again.  It is too bad also since this looked to be a great treat, I looked at the ingredient list and did some research on all the ingredients and the only one that can cause an allergy is carrageenan, which is the vegetarian equivalent of casein, used as filler.  It is a natural ingredient derived from seaweed, but is said to cause digestive problems.  Most doggie treats do not contain carrageenan so this is the only ingredient that may have caused a reaction in my dog.  I am giving the treat two stars for the effort and intention, but there really should have been more research regarding the fillers.

review/summary: Variety is the spice of life
review/text: I have 2 dogs and while I don't give a lot of treats, I like to have a variety of items on hand to put in the everlasting ball, Kong etc., to keep them interested on days when the weather is not conducive to getting out.  My thought with these sticks was that if I cut a little off one end, it would be a perfect fit for the everlasting ball.  It turns out, they are hard as a rock!  I tried a couple of different knives and even my meat cleaver, but none of them made any headway in cutting off the 2" I needed to remove.  Then I picked it up and tried to break it with my hands, and it snapped in two right on the line I had been trying to cut (perhaps I scored it a little).  Anyway, it turns out that is the secret to these things - breaking instead of cutting.<br /><br />I am not in the least concerned about the caloric value of them so that was not figured into my perception of the treats in any way.  One of my dogs is slender - the other downright skinny (has a high metabolism and is offered plenty to eat but never finishes a meal).  The older, slender dog got the 2" bit I cut off and the younger skinny dog got the remainder of the stick in her everlasting ball.  May not be fair but she had to work harder to get it so it all comes out in the wash.<br /><br />The older dog practically took my hand off to get to the treat quickly.  Once she had it, she ran off and put it back on the floor so she could take her time with it.  I will say that the little 2" stick lasted her much longer than I would have expected so I rate them high for that reason.  The chewing action is good for their teeth/jaws and is far preferable to a treat they gobble down without tasting.<br /><br />The younger dog went racing after her everlasting ball and stayed busy for a long time trying to get it out.  I wasn't around when she finally succeeded to know how long it took her to eat it but am glad it kept her interested for awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is cute and the bag is resealable.  I believe they are kind of pricey and for that reason I might not order them again.  Otherwise I am completely satisfied.

review/summary: The dog loves it!
review/text: Normally, I spell out the ingredients off of the package when I do these reviews; but I'm learning that people do not mark that as helpful.  So, if you are curious about the ingredients...please read the description!  And, I obviously have not ate one of these dog treats personally!  But I can tell you this much--my dog loves these treats.  In fact, I have never seen her run so fast to get a treat.  If I leave the package out on the counter...she hangs around and sits until I give her one.  She actually will mind perfectly if she knows these treats are out.  It's kind of funny, really!  I honestly have to hide them...because other wise she will keep sniffing under the pantry door.  The product itself smells like a dog treat, and it's a good sized treat for my dog.  (She is a 78 pound boxer)  So for smaller dogs you could probably break it in half and make the bag last longer.  My dog has eaten the sticks on the carpet...and I have not noticed any stains, so I don't think there is a lot of coloring to them.  I clean up after her anyway because that is my preference...but I don't get the brown color like other treats.  Anyway, because of my dogs response to them...I am getting them again.  They'll make a great stocking stuffer!!

review/summary: My Aussie kinda likes them
review/text: My 5-year-old Australian shepherd, Pete, has put on a lot of weight in the last 18 months, so I was curious to see how he would take to a low calorie treat.<br />I placed a regular size Milk Bone, a small Beggin' Strip, and a Zoe treat stick side-by-side on the carpet and invited Pete to help himself.<br />Being wary like most Aussies, he cautiously sniffed each offering, then took the Milk Bone. When he was finished with the Milk Bone, he picked the Beggin' Strip. Finally, when there was only one choice left, he took the Zoe treat stick.<br />I did this test with him four times to see if he would develop a taste for the Zoe treat sticks, but the results were always the same.<br />From a health and caloric point of view, the Zoe treat sticks may be the better choice, but Pete's interested in them only if nothing else is available.<br />I suppose that's true of people and diet food too.<br />At any rate, Pete gives 'em 2 stars.

review/summary: Healthy treat!
review/text: Zoe Lifestyle Treats for Dogs are a healthy alternative to the typical high-calorie dog snacks which you find in stores today. The product is gluten-free and is a good source of soluble fiber. These treats are as hard as a rock which would probably be troublesome for older dogs with poor teeth. I tested these treats on a 2-year-old lab and a 9-year-old golden retriever. Keep in mind...they will eat just about anything. Both dogs threw the sticks on the ground and proceeded to sniff them.  I am not sure, but I think the cinnamon spice flavor threw them off a bit.  After rolling the sticks around on the ground, I am happy to report that they ate them. The next day, I offered them another treat and they didn't seem too excited. Overall, if you are into healthy dog food, these snacks are sensible treats. Personally, I wouldn't buy them again due to the price and the firmness of the product. I would be concerned that my dog would break a tooth.

review/summary: Great item, disappointing price & shipping service from Amazon
review/text: Love these treats for my puppy and my veterinarian was pleased with this product since the pup is slightly overweight and made in the USA, unfortunately they are quite pricey.  But when I started on the automatic monthly shipments from Amazon at the reduced price, Amazon cancelled the automatic shipments before the first shipment, for whatever reason, so now I have to buy them at the full higher price.  I guess someone wanted MORE MONEY so I will have to either buy them less frequently or find somewhere else to get them at a better price or look for something else.  How sad for my puppy, she really, really enjoys these treats.

review/summary: A great dog treat for special diet or sensitive needs
review/text: I saved these treat sticks for my German Shepherd who had been licking her paws a lot to the point of bleeding.  When I told the vet about it she suggested a wheat free diet. These treats went right along with that new diet since they are gluten-free, wheat-free, corn-free, and soy-free.  They are also good for the dogs teeth.  She liked them and enthusiastically ate them all. The vet was right..... along with diet changes, to include these low calorie treats, my German Sheppard quit her over-licking problem.  They are somewhat solid, but chewy for the dog and it's evident the dog enjoyed the taste.  I will continue to use these treats for my Shepherd and will purchase the medium sized treat sticks for my smaller English Setter.

review/text: I have a dog that is a Jack Russell Terrier that will eat anything and her weight shows it... So it really isn't saying much that she likes these treats. On the plus side, they are low-calorie and it takes her longer to eat one of the Zoe sticks than it does to eat one of her nightly Dentastix (the two products look very similar) but I suppose the Zoe sticks are denser and a bit tougher to chew through and so last longer.  If they are low-calorie and she'll eat it, I consider it a good product!

That said, buy treats for your dogs, if that's who will be eating them, not yourself.<br /><br />My larger dogs (70#, excellent teeth, and 30#, bad teeth) inhaled these chews, taking just a little longer than they would take to eat fresh meat.  For this price, chews have to last a bit longer.<br /><br />I do not understand how the chews could be considered "hard" if used straight from the package.  YMMV.  My Chihuahua took two days to eat his.  He left a mess.  The bigger dogs didn't.<br /><br />My larger, 55# and underweight, young girl dog would not touch these chews on two different days.  She is one of the last dogs on the planet who needs either low fat or low calorie treats, so perhaps she was using good doggie judgement in not wasting chewing-effort-calories on a treat that may have a negative caloric payoff.

review/summary: Chico loved them!
review/text: These strips were an instant hit with our pit bull chico.  In fact whenever anyone approached him when he was chewing he would growl, very unusual behavior for him.  The strips themselves are denser and chewier than others we've had.  There is no artifical coloring to them so no carpet staining.  The low cal aspect was also a plus for us.  Definately will be buying again!

review/summary: Dogs gobbled them up
review/text: The smell isn't pretty as with most dog treats. But my dogs knew as soon as they heard this bag what they were getting.  The treat is hard for them to chew on for a little bit. Not like a rawhide that last for days, but enough to keep them busy for a while.  Since there's an odd number in the package I had to attempt to break one in half. It was difficult but I did it to split between the two dogs. They loved it.

review/summary: Good treat, but pricey
review/text: My dogs love chewy treats and these seemed like a good possible option to combine a safe and healthy treat with the opportunity to chew.  On the positive side, there was no excess packaging, the treats arelow calorie, gluten free  and safe/healthy for your dog if given in the recommended amounts and even for dogs on strict diets.  There's a nice cinnamon smell that's appealing to humans.  Both my dogs appeared to enjoy this treat and were eager for a second once they ate the first, so in addition to the positive aspects for a cautious owner, it was also popular with the intended audience.<br /><br />However, I'd also caveat this with a few other issues.  First, the package says a medium dog could get 2 sticks per day.  There are six sticks in a bag and the cost is $6 - that's fairly pricey given that my dogs (admittedly expert, hardy chewers) ate their sticks in less than 5 minutes.  While the cinnamon scent is appealing to humans, one of my dogs didn't seem excited about it at first.  She did decide to eat it after a couple minutes (she initially put it down and backed away), but only because the other dog expressed interest.  Once she ate the first one, she seemed more than willing to take another, but there was an initial hesitation.  I'd expected something that might take longer to chew through.  I'm the first to admit my dogs are super-chewers, so if your dog doesn't have jaws of steel, you might get more out of this treat, but it took between 2 -4 minutes (depending on which of the dogs) to eat the strips.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't mind the price, it's not a bad treat.

review/summary: Yorkie likes!
review/text: It can be difficult writing reviews of pet food/treats for obvious reasons and most everyone can read the nutritional information in the item description area, so I will just say that our large build 12 lb Yorkie LOVED these treats! There are a lot of times where she will tire of biscuits and seem reluctant to take them, but that was not the case with these things. When she heard either one of us messing with the packaging, she would be right there to make her presence known and show us her "puppy dog" eyes. As you bend down to hand one to her, she would jump up on her hind legs and excitedly grab it from you and run off to consume it.<br /><br />On a practical level, these things seem to be a bit pricey (as healthy foods tend to be) at about a dollar per... If you believe that your pet could benefit from these for a short period of time, then go ahead and try them. However, if your pet already seems to be in good shape, stick with what you are doing and don't over do it.<br /><br />This will not cost the product any stars, as all necessary information is provided for you to review before your purchase and the fact that our Yorkie likes them. In the future, I would buy them again to throw in a bit of variety, but not as an everyday option.

review/summary: My Picky Dog Loved These!
review/text: I have a 9lb dachshund and I didn't notice the size on these when I ordered them and they are recommended for dogs 30lbs and over.  They are large sticks that most adult dogs would eat in a few bites, but this one lasted about 30 minutes for my dog.  She loved them, begged for them and when the package was empty, knocked the trash can down to get at the wrapper which she licked clean.  These are all organic and smell wonderfully almost like cinnamon.  With a smaller dog, they do make a bit of a mess since she has to chew it slowly so put something under your pet before letting them go at it.  I think they even helps clean her teeth a bit which is a real bonus.  I am now looking for a smaller size to order for her.

review/summary: No wheat, corn, or soy - my dog loves them
review/text: First of all, these chew sticks are made in the U.S. which is a must for us when it comes to feeding our dog. Well, maybe not strictly U.S. only but definitely not China as so many dog treats come from there. I don't trust China for edible dog products and never will.  My dog Sheila usually tears through her treats in a hurry - but what we like about these is that it takes her a while to get through one. She has to work at it for a while, which is good for gum stimulation and teeth cleaning.<br /><br />We don't feed Sheila anything that has wheat, corn, or soy in it. These treats contain none of those filler ingredients. The main ingredients are rice flour and quinoa flour.  We always feed grain free food, but we make some exceptions for treats (again, as long as it is not wheat or corn).<br /><br />The cinnamon spice flavored sticks smell very pleasant and they keep Sheila busy for a while. The large size works well for her - she is about 50 lbs.

review/summary: The tails wag for this one
review/text: I assembled my canine product testing panel - Hunter, a 65 lb. Golden Retriever who has some weight issues and Boston, a 35 lib mixed breed who has some dental issues.  I offered the treats, both testers took them readily.  Boston retired to a comfortable spot and began to chew quite eagerly.  Hunter took the entire stick into his mouth which caused me some concern that he would choke on it.  I ordered him to drop the stick, which luckily he did.  I gave him back the stick but held on to one end so he could not take the whole thing in his mouth again. I kept hold of the (now slimy) stick until Hunter chewed off a couple appropriate size chunks.  Once the pieces were a safer size I let him enjoy, which he definitely did.  Boston, meanwhile, was holding the stick between his paws and chewing on it, taking off bite size pieces.  I had no concerns about how he was managing the product.  Both dogs were quite interesting in repeating the test.<br /><br />I offered the product again the following day.  Both dogs were quite eager.  Again Boston had no problem managing the product in a safe manner.  I gave Hunter the stick but retained control of one end so he could not gulp it whole.  He began to chew off a piece, and did eat the product safely.  I inspected Boston's teeth after he finished his portion and was pleased that there seemed to be some lessening in the tarter buildup on the back teeth.<br /><br />Both of my dogs liked the product, although to be fair neither is very picky.  I also offered the product to two other dogs, a 50 lib mixed breed who managed it quite readily and a 10 lb Yorkie who chewed it a bit and then buried it.  I am concerned that a larger, greedy dog like Hunter could choke on this.<br /><br />I like that the product is low calorie but I think that at nearly a dollar a stick it is a bit pricey.  I like that the sticks are hard enough to make the dogs chew.  Boston did seem to get some teeth cleaning benefits from the product.  Unfortunately due to the high price and the safety issues for Hunter I probably will not be purchasing this again.

These treats are low fat and they are a nicely flavored spice helping with healthy choices and helping her teeth. They also help with keeping tartar down as they are not quickly consumed. She will not eat anything she doesn't like and she takes these from me very excitedly whenever they are offered.  Very pleased with this product.

For dogs with sensitive digestion these are gluten free and are made with high protein grain. For human noses these have a slight smell that is not overpowering.<br /><br />We have three dogs with the smallest being around 50-55 pounds. Our puppy is around 65-70 and our biggest around 90 pounds. All three enjoyed the treat stick. Obviously these are all big dogs so I can't speak for small dogs but when all of ours enjoy them I can recommend these to all big dog owners.

I'd say they're just right for my dog, so for a bigger dog they might be a bit small (but not a choking hazard or anything, I don't think).

I offered this treat to all three dogs and they loved it - there was no hesitation about taking or eating it. While they enjoyed the treat, it didn't last very long (I would say at most a minute). If you're looking for a treat that your dogs will take time eating, this isn't it (or maybe it is if you have a smaller dog). But if you're looking for a treat that's healthy and an alternative to the other dental chews out there, this is a good option though a tad expensive (almost $1 each).

All three of them took off with them as if they were special treats, and I had wanted to try them because one of my dogs is on a diet, and this was a low-fat treat.  Unfortunately, there were only 7 in the package, so it's doubtful I'll be buying them again.  I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AYL9NU">Get Naked Low Calorie Dental Chew Sticks for Dogs, Small/6.2-Ounce, 18 sticks/Pack</a>, because although they are smaller in size, they lasted about as long as this treat, and they weren't all gone after the 2nd one.  Still, The ZOE Low Calorie Chew Sticks would be great for a household that had fewer dogs.

They are gluten free which is important for many breeds who may have allergies or skin issues. I would recommend these to other dog owners as long as their dog does not have dental issues. They give the dog a nice chew and crumble a bit so that your dog won't swallow a big chunk by accident. They also have healthy ingredients which more and more dog owners are paying attention to these days. No corn, white flour, or unhealthy animal fats here. Ditch the crummy milk bones and get these.

review/summary: Daisy likes them
review/text: I give 5 stars to anything my dog likes because she's so picky.  People will give her a doggy snack/biscuit and she'll let it drop out of her mouth and onto the ground. So embarrassing.  When I first gave her one of the Zoe Low Calorie chew sticks, she trotted off with it and then laid it down, seemingly forgotten.  I was was ready to say she didn't like them, but, when I gave the stick back to her during her brushing(I have give her something to chew on so she doesn't chew on me), she gobbled it up, and in fact, it took 3 sticks to get through her half hour brush-out(she's a rough collie, like Lassie).<br /><br />Though  Zoe treats are low calorie, something my dog doesn't have to worry about, they still apparently taste good.  They smell like doggy-treat with cinnamon to me, nothing I'd want to eat, but then I'm not the one testing the product.<br /><br />These treats are gluten-free, something I watch out for with my dog because collies are prone to skin problems.  The ingredients are as listed:<br />Brown rice flour<br />organic quinoa flour, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, tapioca starch(I've heard this is good in prevent cancer)oat fiber, oat groats, chicken, natural chicken flavor, calcium carbonate, organic flaxseed, carrots, chia seed, cinnamon, carrogeenan, furtooligosachride(A natural probiotic found in bananas), L-carnitrine(helps turn fat into energy).<br /><br />With all this good stuff going on, I wish the kids were still young enough to get them to eat these sticks.  It would be a whole lot healthier than most of the human snacks out there.  And they were never as picky as Daisy.

review/text: Zeus, my 11-year old, 120# Alaskan malamute is fussy about treats. He approaches all treats with suspicion. And cinnamon spice is not exactly his favorite flavor. He prefers chicken or salmon. Even though these contain chicken and natural chicken flavor they smell like cinnamon and nutmeg. I assumed he would turn up his nose. I set a treat stick at his feet. He ignored it for several minutes so I figured that was that. When I turned my back he started eagerly chewing on it. He devoured it. He begged for more. He loved it! Hey Pep&eacute;! Pep&eacute; is my 2-year old Chihuahua/mini-dachshund. He'll eat anything. I cut one in half for him. He was thrilled. He also loved it. But I knew he would.<br /><br />These treat sticks contain really healthy ingredients like brown rice flour, organic quinoa flour, oat fiber and oat groats. I had to look up FOS - aka fructooligosaccharide. It's a probiotic, which is great. However FOS can cause gas, bloating, and intestinal discomfort. So I recommend one treat per day for large dogs and one half per day for small dogs. My dogs like these treat sticks so much I just set up the subscribe and save for the small and large, low cal for each dog. It's a good deal.

review/summary: Zoe Chew Sticks: "the lifestyle treats for dogs"
review/text: Cinnamon Spice Flavor 6.6.ounce, large size sticks - here's our review, and the opinions of our dogs!<br /><br />Today our dogs tried out the Zoe Chew Sticks.  These sticks were a hit.  They are similar to Pedigree Dentastix, but I think these last longer.  The 6 sticks are each about 5 inches long and the cinnamon flavor actually smelled pretty good.  The packaging says gluten-free, low calorie, and high protein grain for excellent source of energy.  Our Basset Hound, who usually inhales her treats, actually took some time to get through hers.  Our Rat Terrier chewed hers in great gusto.  She's a bit overweight right now, so it was encouraging to find a "low calorie" treat.  We have a visiting Springer Spaniel and she enjoyed the odd treat to her normal rawhide chips.  I did not give it to my older Beagle as she is on a "low protein" diet and the packaging says "high protein".  As the dogs ate them, there were a few that broke off larger pieces to work on.  I wondered if I could break a stick in 1/2 for the smaller dog, but they do not break, or even bend.  They are not greasy and the packaging has a re-sealable zip top for easy storage.  Overall, the dogs really enjoyed the Zoe Chew Sticks and I enjoyed the fact that the sticks seem to be a fairly healthy alternative to raw hide chews.

Normally these "organic" dog products that promise to be so healthy just aren't attractive to dogs.  A lot of good a healthy treat is if the dog won't eat it.  But apparently this one delivers all that plus taste too.  Slightly pricier than other brands of chew sticks, but in this case I would say it was worth it.

It helps to know that you are providing them with a low calorie snack (especially for those who have more sedentary pets, not a problem here).  These are substantial for their size measuring in at approximately 5 inches by 1/2 inch.  They are also gluten free and full of soluble fiber.  Now, I haven't heard any of our pups complaining about needing to be on a gluten free diet or needing more fiber, but certainly it can't hurt.  All in all, a healthier alternative to some of the other brands out there.

review/summary: Jilly Loved It
review/text: I have to start out by saying that I don't like it "fancy or gourmet" dog products. Dogs will eat just about anything, except for broccoli and carrots with my baby Jilly, and to get some item when you are paying mostly for either package design or brand name isn't something I buy into being that stuff impresses me, not her.  That being said I did like this product and more importantly Jilly loved it.  These have the same X shape as a dentastix, so I have to assume it would help getting rid of some plaque buildup, although there are no claims on the package.  The cinnamon and spice flavor was potent enough that I could smell it when I opened the package, which I liked, being I knew what she is getting.  And even though the flavor might be more for me than for Jilly, it sure is an improvement over liver flavors etc.<br /><br />Compared to similar products this was harder and took her more time to eat, which I liked.  It took her about 8-10 minutes and a lot of similar type products she eats in just a few minutes.  All that being said, I really did enjoy the product for what it was, but I am not so sure about any weight loss or health benefits.  The L-Carnitine proudly displayed on the front of the package, right next to the antioxidants came off as something like lycopene does for people.  Sure it's good for you and you should eat more of it but when you do do you honestly notice a difference in the way you feel?  As to the weight loss aspects, my dog is only about 8 months old and she's normal weight, but a bit husky being she's a lab. She has some small milk dud sized treats that are her absolute favorites that are 3 calories each and a handful would have less calories than this bone, if weight was an issue and Jilly prefers a natural bone (real bone not rawhide) and it takes her a LONG time to eat and I can't believe the amount of calories she gets per preserving is more than 92.<br /><br />Basically, for what it is it's a very good product, that being said there are most likely better options out there if you aren't willing to spend money on the nice smell and nice packaging.  I'm not sure if I would order it again, but maybe being I like to give her a verity in treats being she eats the same old same old kibble.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars.

review/text: I saw these new Zoe treats <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QRPH78">Zoe Low Calorie 6.2-Ounce Chew Sticks, Small</a>and decide to try them. My dog (My Best Friend) Sophie is an 8 year old 9 pound Poodle Maltese mix with a very sensitive stomach. I've found very few treats that she can eat without throwing them up. I thought I would try Zoe treats since they had all natural ingredients and I have very few choices so far that Sophie likes. Well - So far so good, Sophie loves the treats and no problems with her stomach. Because of Sophie's sensitive stomach and size I give her � of a stick at a time and she likes then so well she begs for more. It's nice to find a healthy treat that my Sophie likes.

review/summary: Doggy likey, wallet not so much
review/text: Thought I would try something new since my mixed breed senior stopped eating the daily morning bone (!) we would give him for breakfast (Iam's brand).  He immediately took to these, which kind of surprised me given they are..."spicy" and I never knew him to like things like that.  Who knew dogs like cinnamon?!<br /><br />Anyhoo, seems to like them fine, and I definitely like the fact that they are lo cal, but the price...geez...a little overpriced!  I always thought the Greenies were good, but crazy expensive, and these seem to be priced at least as high as Greenies.<br /><br />Also, the fact that the manufacturer instructions indicate two of these sticks a day, and the fact that there are about 6-8 a pack, seems a little crazy.  So buy 2 packs a week?!  Come on...make a box with 30 or 40 if you want people to actually follow your instructions without buying a silly amount of bags of these things (and hopefully to help get cost down)!  They probably don't do this because people would get sticker shock if they saw these priced in a box (would be approx. $30-$40!)<br /><br />Pricing is way off, but product seems to be good.<br /><br />Edit:  After trying these out, I signed up for a "subscription" to have the larger version (in the shape of bones) delivered via Amazon...and for my biggish dog, I like the bone version much better...he spends more time chewing it (partly why I wanted these was to use as a teeth cleaning device).  If you have a big dog (>70 lbs or so I guess), you might want to check out the Large Zoe dental chew treats instead.  Also note that the "subscribe and save" option via Amazon makes the cost much more palatable, so diminishes my complaint about price somewhat.

review/summary: My dogs love these.
review/text: These are sticks with ribs protruding.  I am going to use the same review I did for another ZOE product, because it is as true for this product as it was for the other one:<br /><br />I have an older dog - Lab/Pit mix = and a puppy - Maltese/ShiTzu mix, about 5 months.  They fight to take these away from each other.  They growl when the other approaches.  It's funny to watch, and they are usually fairly good about sharing.  If Big steals from Little, Little finds Big's treat and steals it for herself.  And vice versa.  Not these.  They go to opposite ends of the house and glare balefully at t'other while they chew.  I would certainly buy these - if my local store carried them and I had a coupon and they were on sale.  I'd like both a coupon AND on sale, but for these, I might only require one; the dogs love them that much.

review/summary: Worth the Price for High Quality
review/text: This is a bit more costly than other candy but Amazon offers the best price along with FSSS. The first time you try it it will be a new experience. The candy is like a hybrid of gum and starburst.<br /><br />They are highly addictive and I locked them away so I wouldn't eat them all in one day... Best for special occasions like going to the movies or would make a great small gift with a gift card in my opinion.<br /><br />In the end it is about quality. They are just awesome and do not have an extreme sugar taste like Starburst. They are basically imported too (from Taiwan, product originated in Japan) so that also adds to the value.<br /><br />GIVE THEM A TRY! I am probably going to try melon next.

review/summary: Fantastic flavor, great texture; very addictive candy!
review/text: The first thing you'll notice when you start chewing a piece of Hi-Chew is the interesting texture; sort of a combination of a gum, a taffy, and chewable wax, but definitely not like anything you've ever chewed before. Next you'll begin to appreciate the tangy green apple flavor that actually gets stronger as you chew.<br />If you're like me, you will NOT be able to stop after one or two pieces, that's why it's so cool that you can buy 20 packs at a time for such a great price here on Amazon. The other flavors are good too, but Green Apple is what I and most people I know prefer.

review/text: This is a great all natural treat that my dog ADORES.  If there's even a hint of chicken, her recall skills increase dramatically a thousand fold.  She will drop everything she's doing just to get a taste of this chicken.<br /><br />The only problem with this product is that my dog loves it so much...so we are basically going to have to buy this for many more years to come!

review/text: My two medium size dogs are insane for these treats! They arrived 2 days ago and were an immediate hit. I believe they like these even better than Pig Ears, and they worship pig ears! These Chik 'n Rings are somewhat small but are easily chewed by the doggies. And they smell good. The dogs perk right up and come running when I take these out of the cupboard. I highly recommend these!

review/summary: Very good high gravity brew
review/text: This is a very good kit if you like the style - make sure you do like the style before making it, though. Having 50 bottles of such a strong beer could be a big mistake for people who like generic light beers. It has a bit of a fruity overtone, and is not too heavy at all in flavor. It is certainly heavy in alcohol. After each swallow you'll feel that warm jiggle in your throat almost like you had a shot of vodka.
