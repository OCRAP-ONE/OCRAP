review/summary: Fairly disappointed
review/text: I ordered this when I first got my Keurig because I thought it would make a great k-cup based on the bagged teas by Bigelow.  I was wrong.  It was much weaker.  In fact, I received a sample of another black tea that is generally very weak in the bag and it was far superior to the taste of this particular Bigelow tea.<br /><br />Bummer.  Won't be ordering this one again.<br /><br />Additionally, on all teas ordered, you better arrange for faster shipping or you'll be waiting till next Christmas to get it!

review/summary: Do NOT buy these!
review/text: That's right, don't buy!  Why?  Because:<br /><br />A) If you don't buy them there will be more for me.  :-)<br /><br />B) They are extremely addictive and you will gain 5 pounds in 1 month.<br /><br />In all seriousness, these are delicious.  The praline sugary stuff sticks really well to the pecans and there is a nice-sized handful in each snack-size bag.  They are a little pricey at more than $1/bag but I think you'll find them well worth it. I'm about to order more!!  Yum!!

review/text: At first bite  it was a little dark tasting but as i continued eating it left a lasting impression. A very high qualty Praline and a good value for the amount, some pralines have a candy coating wich can be a bit much on the sugary side and some have a coating of milky brown sugar coating, but pear's has a baked-on glazed coating and its just right. i consider myself a praline pecan lover and this gets a A- in my grading list great with warm or iced coffee and with ice cream but also awesome as a stand alone snack... trust me once you try them you will love them!

review/text: Delicious candy pecans in small packages are just great for a snack when you don't want to overdo it. Each package is supposed to be 2 servings. I find sometimes I eat the whole little baggie, but it's still better than some other sweets as the nuts are good for you and oil in nuts balances any sugar spike.<br /><br />I also use them for mini-gifts and in making pecan pie.

review/text: If you want a good pecan praline,and you've decided that it's your splurge, why waste the calories on something that just isn't quite there. Good, but....(you can shrug your shoulders here :-) ).<br /><br />On the other hand, these are really good. Just what you are looking for.  The other lady said "DO NOT BUY THESE" if you want to stop at just one. I'll reiterate that sentiment.  She's right, these are that good. Hope Amazon keeps carrying these.<br /><br />BTW- no stingy dried out little pecans here.  These are immense, fresh, succulent, beautiful pecans.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Ok snack, but I won't buy again
review/text: These pecans have a salty sweet glaze and are very rich. I usually have a hard time stopping when it comes to praline pecans, but I haven't felt compelled to open up a second bag in the same setting. The thick coating is pretty hard and my mouth is a little raw after eating a 2 ounce bag. The pecans are good quality but I did eat a few that had a slight bitter taste. I prefer an off brand praline pecan at one of my local stores. They use premium pecans with a perfect texture, lighter glaze but just as sweet and not salty. I decided to try these pecans because the other brand is 10.99 at full price for just 10 ounces. Once I finish these pralines I will be going back to the store brand.

review/summary: Very Rich and Delicious
review/text: I'm a Starbucks Cafe Verona fan, and use it in my Tassimo brewer, which I've had for four years, so I'm throroughly spoiled.  But now, with coffee prices (especially Starbucks) going so high - I had to find a suitable replacement coffee that was equally as full bodied and delicious and not so terribly expensive!  I've found that Gevelia Signature Blend is a close second.  I receive it automatically - when I designate - through my Amazon Shop and Save subscription - which is great because I'm not running all over town trying to find a good price.  There are also 16 discs rather than Starbucks 12.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a rich full bodied cup of coffee.

review/summary: Exploding T-Discs
review/text: I've been buying the Gevalia Signature Blend T-Discs for a few years and have been getting them from Amazon for most of that time.  I also buy other T-Discs and have used them all without incident for all that time.  Until last week.  We just opened our latest shipment of Gevalia Signature Blend (3-pack) from Amazon and have found the T-Discs to be defective.  The foil around the center "port" is not secure all the way around and during brewing, the seal fails and the T-Discs "explode" for lack of a better word.  Essentially, the pressure in the T-Disc builds up, the foil seal around the port fails (and rips further) and the pressurized coffee grounds are expelled out of the T-Disc.  If the Tassimo is opened at this time, the grounds go EVERYWHERE.<br /><br />After trying a number of these discs and observing the result, trying other discs (Maxwell House) which don't have this issue, and finally dissecting some of the Gevalia Discs that hadn't been through the brewing process, I found the issue being the foil not being sealed sufficiently around the center port.  The Lot Number on these discs is J5411054 and have a Best When Used By date of "2012 FEB/FE 18".<br /><br />I've called Tassimo (800 number is on the T-Disc packages) and they are sending replacements.  They said this is a rare occurrence.<br /><br />If you have had this same issue, please post here with the Lot Number.<br /><br />I will still continue to order these T-Discs from Amazon, but am taking a break until I have tried the replacement discs from Tassimo.  In the meantime, I'll just be using the Maxwell House T-Discs that I also purchase from Amazon.<br /><br />I'm giving this 2 stars for now.  Prior to this situation, I would have rated these T-Discs as 4 stars.  They would get 5 stars, but I think they're a little overpriced, but my wife prefers these to the Maxwell House.

review/text: This stuff is real Mafia olive oil! Genco has been imported since the turn of the last century but it was mostly available only in the northeastern tier of the US.

review/summary: Mild buttery flavor which is easy to consume
review/text: I've purchased this product several times in the past and the taste is excellent.  I have used many brands and this is my favorite.  It has none of the sting and aftertaste of some of the other extra virgin olive oils.  The price is excellent.  It has a rich buttery flavor which I find very agreeable.  It must be refrigerated if stored for any period of time due to the fact that olive oil will turn rancid due to heat.  I use a dark green bottle to dispense what I plan to use in a short time to avoid light which affects taste.  It is an excellent product for medicinal purposes as well.  I've found that extra virgin olive oil is particularly useful for the treatment of diabetes.  The anti-oxidents in it allow the body's cells to absorb insulin much easier which lowers blood sugar.  Mixed with fresh garlic this effect is increased even more.  This brand can be consumed by itself much easier due to its very mild taste.  Some of the other brands tend to leave a nasty after-bite that is very uncomfortable.  I will not mention the other brands as this would not be fair to them.  I'm sure each brand of olive oil has it's own following due to the taste preferences of the person who is using it.  I highly recommend this brand but I wish the price had not increased by such a large amount.  It is still a good value though.

review/text: This extra virgin olive oil is one of the lowest quality EVOOs I have ever tasted. It is very bitter if you taste it on a stand alone sip from a spoon and compare it with a true pure extra virgin olive oil (which tend to be much more expensive ...you get what you pay for). I have tasted dozens of olive oils from around the world. The reason the price is so low is because the quality is incredibly low.

review/summary: Great Oil. Great Price
review/text: For those tired of paying nearly $1 an ounce for extra-virgin olive oil at your local market this is that rare item: a true bargain. This is a great olive oil, very light, none of the 10W-30 oiliness of some olive oils. Very subtle taste, just a hint of the taste of the ripe olives it comes from. You can use this on anything without the flavor coloring the taste. Great for coating things you're roasting or grilling with a moisture barrier to keep juices in, all with the mono-unsaturated benefits of the oil. The pop-out plastic spout is very good. And the can looks good in your kitchen, where it will impress your movie-buff friends. "Genco" was the name of the Godfather's olive oil import business. Well worth it. 128 ounces for your 25 bucks.

review/summary: Great for soap!
review/text: I use this oil quite a bit for making soap and it's wonderful!  I actually use it in several recipes including a 100% olive oil Castile and they all come out beautiful! I would say this oil is a medium color with a light smell. It's not going to make a dark colored soap. It does make a creamy 100% olive Castile and it traces well for Castile soap.<br />If you enjoy soap making I definately recommend this product!

review/summary: Now our third purchase
review/text: We use this olive oil for cooking daily.  However, when we run out of the more flavorful specialized olive oil that we use daily in salad dressings and a "finishing oil" this one is still so much better than the more common olive oils in the store.  AND per ounce is significantly less expensive per ounce than all the oils in the local food store and way better quality than can be found in "big box" stores.  Now that they are packaging it better for shipping we're completely satisfied.  First shipment great.  Second shipment no packaging material used in box and can was dented.  We immediately poured it all out into a large plastic pitcher.  Oil was fine, can did not leak, but not the point.  Tried 1 more time and yesterday it came in packaged well and can in good condition.  Don't be concerned about quantity, I had 1 instance when about 1/2 can of this oil ended up in the cabinet for 6 months and it was just fine, probably could have gone a year.

review/text: This is a very nice Olive Oil for cooking, it has very little olive taste & high burning temp, perfect for frying or cooking without adding extra olive flavor and still keeping the healthy oil benefits. If you are looking for a strong olive taste for salads, this is not it, but the best I have ever used for baking & cooking and will buy more!!!

review/summary: Good for Everyday Cooking and Dipping; Great Price
review/text: I use this oil for everyday cooking, salad dressings, and dipping. There are many other better, more expensive oils. Some are worth paying for, and others aren't. Most average American cooks don't know and can't tell the difference. Of course, cooking with extra virgin olive oil is generally not done because most extra virgin oil is usually too expensive and flavorful for most daily recipes. Even average home chefs should understand that. Many people will not use an entire gallon quickly enough before the oil turns rancid. And it's my advice that unless you know you will use the entire gallon quickly enough, you should probably buy olive oil -- extra virgin or otherwise - by the liter. My current gallon doesn't indicate the origin of the olive oil, but in the past, I have read that Genco contains a mixture of oils from Spain, Italy and Tunisia. It stands to reason that olive oil might be cheaper from Spain and Tunisia, because some people believe that those countries produce less premium products than Italy. That may be true, and it might not. From my last two visits in Spain, I found the olive oil to be of high quality, and quite a bit cheaper than Italian brands. But, let your taste buds -- and the price -- be the judge. I buy my Genco at Sunflower Market in Denver, Colorado, so I don't have to pay for shipping. And, Sunflower has other comparably-priced olive oils whose origin is Spain. Since I don't have a way to analyze oil, I guess I will have to trust that these oils are genuine. I guess it is possible that they aren't. In the meantime, I will continue to buy this oil. Thus far, I have finished 3 gallons for myself, my fianc&eacute;e and our many dinner guests. So far, I have received zero complaints, and I have convinced others to buy this brand.

review/summary: Low on flavor oil
review/text: We bought a gallon of this oil, because the market had a promotion($16.50 per gallon).  My wife disliked it immediately, saying it lacked any real flavor. After a taste test, I had to agree. Olive oil has so much flavor, easily recognized by even a young tongue. The other 2 olive oils in our house were brimming with more olive flavor. So now we use the Genco only for cooking, and use it sparingly. When real flavor is called for, we use the other brands. Take your own taste test; you might be surprised. To be fair, maybe we got a batch of Genco that was "off" a bit. I imagine olive oil producers are subject to the whims of nature, and maybe our gallon was from a less than stellar harvest of olives.<br /><br />Larry (Italian in San Francisco)

review/summary: The Oil is ok but great as a Godfather movie collectible.
review/text: There has been a lot of controversy in the news lately regarding olive oil and extra virgin most specifically. There are claims that most of what is labeled as "extra virgin" is either nothing of the sort or mixed with far inferior oils, most likely not even from olives. If you are a film lover you will find it ironic that organized crime has been blamed for this olive oil scam considering Vito Corleone's Genco Olive Oil Company from the Godfather movies. To be honest, I only purchased this as a collectible because I collect items that are, or look like movie props and this is as close you're going to get to that unless Paramount releases a Godfather licensed Genco Olive Oil, which isn't likely.

review/text: IMHO, taking everything into consideration, I.E. price, quality, and ok taste, I give this product a positive review. I am somewhat suspect of the stand alone, one star review, posted in this forum as of today's date. It seems to be way too 'over the top' negative. Perhaps the olive oil was old or spoiled or in some other way 'Tainted'. That would make that review valid. However, in my college statistics class the professor points out this kind of review would be disregarded. Throw out the best and the worst reviews and go with what remains.<br /><br />Regards, Emul

review/summary: Ok taste, but misleading nutritional info and pricey
review/text: Just The Cheese Barbeque flavor are just about right to my taste: a little too salty, not extraordinarily cheesy, with just a tang of BBQ flavoring. Maybe I have a weird palate, but I'm not hating these snacks like most reviewers do.<br /><br />So why only two stars? For one, JTC brand is hardly "just the cheese." Pull up a chair while I recall the ingredients (other than the cheese) in the Barbeque flavor: powdered cellulose, salt, tomato, torula yeast, spices, dehydrated garlic and onion, natural smoke flavor, paprika, sodium diacetate, inosinate and guanylate, sucralose, and silicon dioxide. Got all that?<br /><br />Two, JTC brand proudly boasts "1 g carbohydrate per serving." Perfect, in other words, for low-carb diets. If you look at the back of the Herb & Garlic flavor, one serving is about 18 pieces, 150 calories, and contains 10 grams protein. So a bag contains two servings. All well and good. Until you get to the Barbeque flavor, where one serving is 9 pieces, 75 calories, and contains 5 grams protein. So the Barbeque bag, which contains the same 2 oz. as the Herb & Onion flavor, has twice as many servings! In other words, JTC brand has toyed with the serving size so they can boast 1 g carbohydrate per serving. Unless you're on an ultra-low carb diet, those few extra carbs won't matter much. But manipulating the serving size to get that crucial "1 g carbohydrate per serving" is dishonest in my book.<br /><br />And finally, JTC brand is too expensive for what you get. I know that cheese isn't cheap, and that JTC brand is a smaller company not affiliated with any of the big names like Nabisco. But a little over two dollars is a bit much for a small bag, even if the texture does relieve a chips craving.

My husband who will eat almost anything, would not touch them after only one bite.  They are dry, stale tasting, salty, almost greasy-ish, and a very poor taste.  Nothing to recommend them.

review/text: The best advice I can give is to try before you buy.  Get a small package from a grocery store so you won't have an entire case of something that's hard to palate.<br /><br />The concept sounded awesome - a crunchy snack made from just plain cheese and spices.  The execution, however, is lacking.<br /><br />These are DRY. Perhaps it's the lack of moisture, or maybe it's the salt - but these make you thirsty fast.  There is not much barbeque flavor to them - and it seems a bit off from standard BBQ.<br /><br />Now I'm just hoping to find one of my friends or family members to take 11 more packages off my hands so they don't have to be thrown out.

I love it because it makes wife and son happy.<br /><br />While it is slightly cheaper (and just as good) than the other organic brands, it can get expensive as my son will sometimes eat as many as he can get his hands on.  We use the Subcribe and Save and the pack of 24 is generally a perfect amount for a month.<br /><br />PS.  Warning.  First time you give a toddler one of these, help them put it in their mouth before you completely hand it off to them.  They don't quite have the finesse to keep from squeezing the fruit puree all over the place as I learned the hard way.

I'm hoping she'll develop a taste for the fresh real stuff eventually! My 17 month old son loves them too! I love the fact that they don't make a huge mess either. Except for my curious son squeezing it all over his high chair tray - he's learning! They are portable too. I throw them in the diaper bag and off I go. I did try freezing them, but they were like a rock and couldn't be eaten right away. I think I'll do that when I know I'm going to be gone most of the day so they can slowly thaw to a good consistency. I also keep them in the fridge because they're better cold. I'm just glad my daughter likes them. We've tried the tropical and stawberry/banana too and they are all hits!

review/text: My kids love these "squeezy pouches", and I was willing to give them a try because they were a decent price, organic, a brand I like, etc.  We haven't tried any others, and I'm not sure I'm inclined to.  The ingredient list doesn't make it clear how much of what's in there is apples vs. berries, etc. of course, but if the price of this flavor is similar to that of other flavors, I'm not surprised if they're mostly apples with a bit of flavoring from other fruits.  I use them to freeze and leave in the cooler when we go out, for a treat later so the kids don't beg for ice cream.  And regarding these types of pouches in general, though they are handy, lightweight, and easy to use, they are also not recyclable, which I very much don't love.  It's a trade-off I guess.

review/summary: Best snack ever
review/text: I love this snack.  I eat it, my husband eats it, but most importantly my 2-year old loves it.  I can replace most requests for other snacks with this and he loves it.  My favorite part is the only ingredient is the fruit purees of 3 types of berries.  That's it.  It's like I pureed fruit myself and put it in a handy pouch.  Each one is only 40 calories too.  Yum!

review/summary: Great for lunch box
review/text: I purchased these on a whim.  I ordered them thinking they might be enjoyed by my dd's ages 11 and 12 in their school lunch.  Turns out their friends are even asking for them.  One day my dd was too full so she gave hers to a friend.  Next time she brought one - friend took it.  Problem is, there are not enough in a box and they go too quickly.  Kids prefer them cold, so I keep them in the fridge.

review/summary: It's really just applesauce
review/text: This product is more applesauce than anything, as another reviewer wrote. I specifically ordered the berry hoping for some actual berries. The product came out looking yellowish, like apples. I am wondering how many berries actually made it into the product.<br /><br />That said, it's good tasting and it's good for you. It's organic puree and it is very convenient. But, as the other reviewer noted, the product that is named after a little rabbit is far superior in its mixture of fruit and consistency.

review/summary: On behalf of my dogs, I can say this is a GREAT tasting food!
review/text: I recently switched my dogs to this food because it won the taste test.  I got free samples of about 30 different foods, and this one was their favorite out of all of them!  Orijen and EVO came in as close seconds.  They love Alpha!  I can use it as treats for training, and they like it enough to work for it enthusiastically.  I do have a complaint that is is very low in calories, which means you feed more, which means it's more expensive.  But, my one dog is overweight, and is on a diet, so I decided a low calorie food may be good for him for a while.  My dogs have only been on it a week, but so far, they're pooping regularly and normally.

review/summary: Good if your dog is constipated
review/text: I switched my two yorkies to Natural Balance (ultra premium) over a year ago and liked it.  However, I saw that this was a new product and one of my yorkies has allergies so I decided to give it a try.  Bad idea!  This food made my dogs poop uncontrollably.  Both of my dogs are house trained and have been for years, but this food made them poop inside and poop multiple times a day!  Unfortunately, I bought two bags of it (this flavor and another) and wanted to use it all.  I'm almost at the end of the second bag and can't wait to transition them to another food.  I don't know why it made them poop so much, but I would not recommend it to others.  Try Natural Balance ultra premium or another top rated dog food.

review/summary: Still searching for my golden Wonka ticket....  (is it 6 bags or 12?)
review/text: I LOVE these chips - they are SIMPLY the BEST!  Better even than HERSHEY KISSES because you don't have to unwrap them, and they taste infinitely better than the semisweet ones.  Here's what you REALLY want to know:<br />In the past, I used to order these from AMAZON and there were always 12 bags in a box.  Now, for some reason, they have decided to split each full box from HERSHEYS in half and sell them in a repacked bunch of 6 bags, rather than 12.  So although the description says, or at least used to say, 12 bags or 138 ounces, and some of the earlier reviews say they got 12 bags, I ordered in January of 2011 and discovered sadly that although at the time the description said 12 bags and the title said 6 bags, you really do now only get 6 bags per order or a total of 69 ounces, NOT 138 ounces.  Unless they change it again - who knows - i hope they do.  I'd rather get 48 bags per order - 12 barely gets me through lunch:).  Thanks anyway AMAZON for all the great work you do and for your stellar, as always, customer service.

review/summary: So bad I threw out the entire batch of cookies I made.
review/text: First I have to say my favorite chocolate bar, out of all I've ever eaten (and that's a lot, including the expensive stuff) I love Hershey's milk chocolate bars the best. I also love many other Hershey candy bars. That's why I was so surprised when I made my very best recipe home made chocolate chip cookies with this brand (instead of what I normally use, Nestl&eacute;) and they tasted so bad I had to throw out the entire batch. It could not be my recipe because it's the same recipe I've been using for over 40 years, loved my many. I was hugely disappointed.<br /><br />For full disclosure I did not buy these at Amazon so to prove I did buy and try them I include a photo above. You'll see I also tried Hershey semi-sweet chocolate chips. They were horrible too.<br /><br />I wasted my time and money making cookies with these chips. Never again.

review/text: All I can say is that this water works. I have revived plants and flowers with it on quite a number of occasions, and it makes me feel really great after drinking it. My hydration level from drinking this water exceeds any other kind of water I've ever had, which means I don't need to drink as much water to get the intended result - relief of dryness. Regular water seems to never fully hydrate me - even after 8 glasses. This stuff does the job with a lot less. I have also seen an increase in energy and vitality in my pets when I have given it to them. It's definitely a treat and worth a try!

review/summary: My niece says the water tastes smart!
review/text: Not everyone can appreciate that quality of water makes a difference. But pure mountain spring water is clearly preferred over tap water. I compare these two kinds of water by the amount of LIFE FORCE still remaining in the water. Since I am way too busy to travel to clean remote places to get high life force water, I have found that I feel better overall, when I can drink a regular  supply of Trivedi water to keep my busy pace of life at maximum speed forward. I have noticed that I have been having a preference for  Trivedi water, at least one bottle a day, sometimes more. My energy is steady, and my temperament is pretty even. I put myself in stressful situations and I can handle them with focused determination and faith that all will work itself out with grace. There just might be some energetic magic in these bottles of Trivedi water, if you can believe and receive. If its a placebo, and life gets better as a result, it could be worth it!<br /><br />My little 7 yr. old niece put it simply, by saying that this water tastes "smart". She could taste the difference between filtered tap water and this energy infused Trivedi water. It became a preference for her to drink it above regular water. I also noticed how she behaved more calm the rest of the day, after she drank it. She seemed more focused after having had experienced the Trivedi effect while she was witnessing the process of infusing the water. I'll be interested in any other significant changes with her well-being in the future. It could be just a coincidence whether she becomes more confident and centered, when before she seemed more insecure, even unsure of herself.<br /><br /> I am so grateful that I discovered this gift that Mr. Trivedi offers seekers of a higher vibration, healthier option in life. He is a renegade, and will definitely shake up a bunch of naysayers, but that's ok with me. Those that remain on this journey, who I meet along the way  have been awesome!!!!!  I love to hear their stories of transformation.  It's just fun to me!<br /><br />Those who can tell the difference between tap water and Trivedi water are pretty evolved human beings in my humble opinion! I think you can observe the health and temperament of those who are sensitive to the difference vs those who can't tell. Who's healthier in general?  I look forward to more products Mr. Trivedi will introduce!  I just heard he's launching energy infused wine. That could be a blast!

review/summary: TRIVEDI WATER IS GREAT!!  GREAT RESULTS!
review/text: Transformed Favorite Tree with the Trivedi Blessed Water - After the San Diego Retreat -<br /><br />My story: I came home from the San Diego Trivedi Retreat and I remembered what Guruji said about wanting us to be "the happiest we could be." I had this thought in my head as I was coming out of my car and when I saw "my favorite" tree in the front lawn. I decided to convey this same message to the Japanese Red Maple tree and to the grass I walked on going to the front door as I poured the last of my Trivedi Blessed water around the base of the Japanese Red Maple and on the grass leading to the front door. Well, this year just 1 month later, the Japanese Red Maple tree has the most beautiful colored and healthy looking leaves and the most unusual beautiful arrangement of pink flowers I had not seen before. I asked my friends and family members if they ever remembered the tree producing so many pink flowers in this circle pattern ever and they all said they do not remember the tree having so many of these kind of pink flowers in this full circular pattern and so many all over the tree. Some remembered it had pink flowers here and there always, but this year they are all over the tree abundantly and each outcropping is in a beautiful and full circle pattern. The flowers are EVERYWHERE this year. ALL OVER the whole tree! Usually the flower bunches are just a few places on the tree, but after the Trivedi Blessed water; the flower bunches were so full and everywhere on the tree!!<br /><br />Also, there is a new Circle Pattern of Flowers on ONE Stem!! No one (friends, family) ever remembers seeing this beautiful circle pattern of a lot of flowers on ONE stem. Usually there are 2 to 5 flowers on a stem but here and everywhere on the tree EACH STEM had at least 500% more flowers per stem after the Trivedi Blessed water. In the past the tree never made this beautiful circle pattern of flowers per stem. Before usually there were just 2-5 flowers on a stem in a random pattern! Now there is this beautiful circle pattern of flowers we have never seen before.<br /><br />Aside from the plants, when I drink one bottle of Trivedi Blessed water daily I feel so energized and healthy. Since I have run out I see that my energy level has gone down some and I'm a little "squeaky" in my joints. I can't wait till it is in stock so I can stock up. In my opinion it is the best present you can buy yourself and any of your friends and family. I know what's going under our tree this Christmas! Maybe not the most conventional gift but my family and friends will thank me later once they start drinking it and pouring it on their plants.<br /><br />PS A neighbor asked us to watch her 2 house plants while they were gone and I used a little Trivedi blessed water that I had from my last retreat and before they could come back 3 weeks later BOTH plants are blooming!! When I asked her if she had ever seen them bloom before, she said she's had them around 5 years and had seen them bloom maybe once. Coincidence? Maybe, but I doubt it. I only used regular water and Trivedi Blessed water on her plants while they were gone. I've seen it too many times when I've poured Trivedi Blessed water on my own plants and bushes. They bloom and flower like never before. This year I used it in our flower pots on the porch and it was the first year in over 20 years that the deer actually came up on our porch (up 2 steps to a concrete porch) to eat the flowers we had planted in the flower pot. The same type of flowers we always plant only this year I used the Trivedi Blessed water in the pots. I don't eat the flowers so I don't know but there must have been something good in those flowers this year for the deer to make their way on our porch to eat them. They never did that before and it's not like the deer around here are hungry, they are all big and fat this year so in my opinion only they were going for their dessert! LOL!<br /><br />PS For more of my results with the Trivedi Blessings and water and to see the actual photos of the Red Maple tree go to thebestoftrivediblessings.com The tree story is no. 10.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this.

review/text: I am thrilled to be able to purchase and have the Trivedi Water delivered to my door!<br />I drink...A LOT of water...My dad taught me the appreciation for water<br />a long time ago, and growing up in athletics,<br />water was and continues to be my preferred source for hydration survival!<br />I consider The DIVINE, to be my primary<br />source of survival in all ways!<br />This water fits perfectly into that equation, as IT is infused with energy from<br />the DIVINE source! I am an overall healthy 55 y/o female and experience close to peak, optimum<br />health in most areas...The water provides for my thirst requirements in tasteless, odorless<br />perfection and is very refreshing!<br />My 26 y/o daughter swears that her skin 'cleared up', she 'feels better', and she has less emotional<br />stress associated with her menstrual cycle. My 6 y/o granddaughter drinks a lot more water when<br />we have Trivedi energy infused water. She said she 'likes the blessed water', 'it's good!'<br />I have photographs from my most amazing testimonial. I dropped a cap full of the water into an<br />almost empty bud vase where a dying red rose had made her home for the previous 2 weeks. Her petals were<br />crispy and all of her leaves had dropped...her stem was brown half the way down and only half of the<br />stem remained green. I watched for several days with the expectation of a miracle. Perhaps, her petals<br />would come back to life! That didn't happen, but what did happen is a tiny shoot with 3 little leaves<br />of bright lime green grew from the spot where one of the dried leaves had dropped!!!<br />My daughter and granddaughter witnessed this with me and I took photographs...Miraculous happening on a<br />cellular level!<br />My dad taught me something else in his efforts to expose me to everything at the dinner table...<br />He said, 'how do you know, if you don't try it?'....what I learned is ...<br />When I didn't try it, he laughed and said, "MORE for ME!"<br /><br />I AM of the humble opinion that we ALL should be provided with<br />this water through our political resources as part of a preventative health care maintenance plan!Thank you

review/summary: Used it for Plants as well as a Drink
review/text: I would like to write about the rose plant that bloomed in middle of November after we had some snow here in Virginia with 35 degree F (close to freezing weather). I used half a bottle of water diluted over the rose plant which was almost dying in mid September. Before I used this water, I could not maintain it well with all the bugs and spotted leaves and roses never able to fully blossom because of all these bugs. I was amazed with the results in just 2 months. Not only were the leaves fully energized and green with no sign of bugs, but middle of November after all the snow and cold weather, we had a beautiful rose show up. The fragrance was so pure and the shelf life of this rose was more than 10 days.<br /><br />I have also used half a bottle of this water on my apple tree and am looking forward to the results next spring.<br /><br />I have used this water filled with energy transmission with amazing success with my herbs along with my own body. We have seen the energy transforming the wine to customize it to my taste but this water has really made these herbs look much more lively within a month with just half a bottle of this water. The herbs continue to thrive for the last few months even though I don't give them as much care as I should because of my travel. I think having the energy to sustain the day and feeling the best as if I was detox'ed with just a bottle of water is not a placebo but real experience for me.<br /><br />I am very skeptical person and don't go with the crowd usually unless I experience it. This is something I feel strongly about that helps everyone, because of my personal experience as well as the science and research.<br /><br />I am also happy that such energy is available in the form of water shipped to my door at a reasonable price.

review/text: I'm a newcomer to Travedi water. Unlike most bottled water, Travedi water tastes good. One noticeable difference--and I'm still testing the effect--is my skin. It looks healthier. (And, yes, I drink water all the time anyway, and I stay away from soda, and other carbonated beverages). All in all, this water can be delivered to your front door and tastes good. In another couple of weeks, I'll give more feedback.<br /><br />Thumbs up!

review/summary: Felt nothing different after 2 cases
review/text: I've had Mr. Trivedi's energy transmissions, and I can feel that energy. So, I bought the water because I thought it would be a nice way to stay "energized" in my daily life.<br /><br />First of all, right on the label it states clearly that it is municipal water treated with reverse osmosis. When I first drank it, it seemed "dry" to me, which is to say it didn't hydrate me the way the water I'm used to drinking does. I usually treat my water with a purifying product, then run it through your basic pitcher filter, nothing expensive. But "my" water feels wetter than the Trivedi water did. It's hard to describe how the Trivedi water made me feel, but it was as if I hadn't even had any water...like, it was just nothing, and all I wanted was MORE water! I can understand if it's "infused" with a "drink more" energy because most people don't drink enough water, but it's too expensive, in my opinion, to drink more, drink more, drink more!<br /><br />AND, I hate the thought of buying water in little bottles. I NEVER buy bottled water because of the huge plastic waste it produces, so I won't be buying anymore of this water, simply because I refuse to put more empty plastic water bottles into the world. Even if it were the most miraculous water on the planet, I wouldn't buy it as it's currently packaged.<br /><br />One last note, I used the water to water an orchid that was given to me as a house warming gift....it totally killed my orchid. I'm not kidding. I watered it according to the correct watering protocol for orchids, as I had been watering it since I'd received it, but when I used the Trivedi water on it, it started to drop leaves, and when I looked at it to see what was happening to it, I found that the soil was completely full of mold and the plant was dead. :(<br /><br />I would like to say that if the Trivedi Foundation started with a more "alive" water - as in REAL spring water - as opposed to municipal RO water, just the water by itself would at least have some value.<br /><br />In closing, I'd like to say that I'm not trying to tell anyone NOT to buy this water. I'm only relating my own personal experience with it.<br /><br />Thank you!

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I love this water.  It's liquid gold.<br /><br />I bought ten cases a year ago and have been giving bottles of Trivedi Water as gifts to family and friends since then.  It makes a wonderful gift.<br />Each person has had their unique experience with it.<br /><br />I'm thrilled it's available on Amazon-now I can use it and share it more freely.<br /><br />I've used Trivedi Water on plants with great success.<br /><br />Most recently I started using it on my skin.  Wow.  It's clearing up acne and revitalizing my skin in a way I couldn't have imagined.<br />Truly amazing.<br /><br />And in terms of drinking Trivedi Water--the taste is indescribable. The closest I could say is that it tastes like pure water from a mountain stream--fresh, clear, and vital with a quality of softness to it.  It quenches some taste or thirst that is deeply satisfying.<br /><br />Try it.

review/summary: Skin Cancer Healing
review/text: For the past few months I've had a sore on my face that would not heal. I had it biopsied a few weeks ago and the doctor told me it was Basil Cell Carcinoma and would need to be surgically removed. I've been applying Trivedi Water for the past week and a half to with amazing results: the sore is drying up and healing. I have faith that it will heal completely using the water.<br /><br />Also, I tend to get headaches when I drink a lot of water. With Trivedi water I can drink as much as I like and it's very hydrating and nourishing to me.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Worked a Miracle on my Border Collie!
review/text: It all began in the summer of 2010 when my brother could no longer handle the border collie I had bought for my nephews' 10th Birthday. The dog, Oreo, had destroyed all of the plants and flowers in his back yard and was close to being sent to the pound. Times were rough so when he offered me $100 to take Oreo back, I jumped at the opportunity.<br />  BIG MISTAKE! I already had a dog and had installed a doggie entrance in my back door, so short of tying Oreo up in my back yard, she had full reign of my property. Not a day went by when I would come home from work and find something missing or chewed to bits. My CD collection, DVD collection, appliance power cords, furniture, shoes, remote controls, plants, etc., etc.!!! If I were to put a price on the damage she caused, it would be $1,000 to $2,000 minimum! I tried spraying vinegar as well as commercial products to save my new furniture but nothing worked.<br />  The dog whisperer had a busy schedule so it dawned on me to try Trivedi water. This miraculous water had helped me with digestive problems and I was hearing about all the other wonderful things credited to Trivedi infused water. I filled Oreo's water bowl for three days straight with Trivedi water. That's all it took!!!<br />  After the third day, Oreo COMPLETELY stopped her destructive behavior! Every now and then she would take one of my shoes to the living room but would NOT chew it!:) I have continued to give her Trivedi water every now and then and she has become one of the sweetest, most well-behaved dogs I have ever owned! It has reached a point where I believe we are psychically connected. She is extremely intelligent and intuitive and has evolved into a wog...half woman/half dog! (haha!)

review/summary: Superb ....
review/text: I have a little garden in my backyard and I love to grow my own vegetables ( weather permitting).  This year I watered some of my plants with Trivedi Water (only twice by mixing with regular tap water in 1:5 ratio).  I was amazed to see those plants which received this water had much better growth, color of leaves was greener, and the vegetables( in this case Okra) were delicious.  By the way no chemicals were sprayed on these plants.

review/summary: Water Wonderful!
review/text: This water is truly amazing.  I immediately feel an increase in my energy when I drink it.  Just for fun, I offered a bottle to my mom, who knew nothing of the story behind the water.  She took a few sips, and we continued our conversation.  About 10 minutes later, she abruptly announced, "I think this water has energy in it."  It was a brilliant moment.  I have also shared this water with my children, who think it is extraordinary and have added it to my dog's bowl as well.  I have begun to add capfuls to the plants in my home as a boost, as others have commented that this helps to increase the plant's vitality. A friend who drinks the water says it has served as an  amazing detox for her and others in her home. If you are reading this, I highly recommend giving it a try so that you may enjoy your own personal experience!

review/summary: Placebo or not, I got excellent results from this water.
review/text: I have had terrible problem with canker sore in my mouth. I tried many different products, but to no aviale. Out of desperation when I got the Trivedi water,I tried leaving the Trivedi Water in my mouth to ease the pain. To my delight within a few minutes, I began to get relief. My canker sore was gone within a couple of days. I am very grateful since I generally suffer with them for 10 days to two weeks. After this delightful result, I tried putting the water on the spider bites since I am allergic to them and get welts. When I got spider bite and it began to swell up, I placed a cotton dampend with the Trivedi Water and within less than ten minutes, the toxic effect was gone. I was really amazed! This was never accomplished by any other products I tried previously. I am very grateful for the product.

review/summary: Multi-Purpose Water!
review/text: The effects of Trivedi Water continue to amaze me. My son contracted "pink eye" and also complained that his eye was hurting.  I had him put some of the water on his eye several times throughout the day and had him drink a full bottle as well. By the next morning, the pain had gone away and the eye had cleared up considerably.  By night time, the "pink eye" had completely cleared up.<br />Also, my son had accidently poured a half bottle of Trivedi Water in one of our house plants.  That plant has been growing like crazy - I've had it for years and it had never grown like this!

review/text: A friend  with diabetes  had a growth removed from her leg. Because diabetics have very thin skin, two months had passed and the wound had still not healed.  She was also in pain.<br /><br />On hearing this, I over-nighted  two bottles of Trivedi Water to her and suggested that every time she changed the bandages--twice a day--she put some Trivedi Water on the wound and let it dry before she put on a fresh bandage.<br /><br />In TWO DAYS she saw such a difference in her leg she could hardly contain her enthusiasim. She went to the doctor two days later for a scheduled appointment and on seeing the progress, her doctor said that instead of going every week to have the wound checked, she didn't have to go back for another three weeks.<br /><br />My friend kept using the Trivedi Water and when she did go back to the doctor three weeks later her leg had completely cleared up and the wound completely healed! She cannot stop thanking me for sending the water to her. She is now also drinking it.<br /><br />Anyone who is familiar with  diabetes knows that it takes quite long for incisions and open wounds to heal, not to mention that it is especially painful.<br /><br />This water is truly God sent!  Thank you, Mr. Trivedi, for making it available to everyone through Amazon.  Much love to you. Albina

review/summary: Great for man and beast!
review/text: I recently bought a case of Trivedi water for myself and my female German Sheppard Labrador mix dog, Riley, who will be 9 in February next year. Each day in the morning, I put some of the Trivedi water in Riley's water dish. I think Riley is more energetic and alert from drinking the Trivedi water.<br /><br />I have a pet sitter who takes care of her when I travel and has taken care of her every couple of months. This is the positive report I got from my pet sitter about Riley after my most recent trip: "All went well over the weekend. Riley seemed to be much more energetic than I've seen in a while. We had some nice long walks until rain on Sunday."<br /><br />Treat yourself and your beloved animal companions and buy this water!

review/summary: Transformation in a Bottle!
review/text: This water is fantastic! I have been drinking highy alkaline water for some time now and as wonderful as that is, the Trivedi water surpasses it by far. It's very sweet and smooth, it helps to give me a clean and sustained energy during the day, and powerfully supports my inner transformational work. It really is an energy transmission in a bottle! I can't wait until I can get it shipped through Amazon -- I'm going to drink it every day, and give it to my family and my animals every day too. It's more than worth the cost and I'm so grateful that this (and other products) are soon going to be on the market. Thank you, Mr. Trivedi!

review/summary: Miracles do happen
review/text: I purchased several cases of the Trivedi Water to try for myself.  After obtaining the water I noticed a cold sore coming on.  I put a little bit of the water (about 1 drop) on the area that was beginning to hurt and repeated this every hour for 12 hours.  At the end of that time the cold sore was GONE.  It has been over a week and I still do not have any signs of the dreaded cold sore.  After that experirnce I had several small cuts on my hands(I work with my hands) and I put the water on these cuts and they were HEALED over night.  I then put some on a pineapple plant that I have struggled with for over a year and the results are nothing short of stunning.  The plant has started to grow with vigor and it is NOVEMBER!  I then put some in my dogs water and they are all much more active and my oldest dog (she is 12) is now acting like a puppy! Please do yourself a favor and try a case of the water.  You will not be disappointed.  Sign me A TRUE BELIEVER.

review/text: The Trivedi water gives me a sense of well being vs. regular filtered water.  Also, I was having an allergic reaction that would have required an antihistamine, but within 3 gulps of the water the reaction completely stopped.  My plants love the water; they are greener and the Peace Lily gave me 3 blooms the very week of being fed the Trivedi water. Thank you Mr. Trivedi!

review/summary: Trivedi Water is Amazing!
review/text: I have a  background in Alternative Medicine and also as a Personal Trainer. Drinking plenty of good quality water is vital to our health and I make sure I drink a minimum of 2 quarts of water a day.<br /><br />Over the last several months since I first met Mr Trivedi, I have been drinking from 1 -4 bottles of Trivedi Water every day. I am delighted that it has become available on Amazon and can now be delivered directly to my door!<br /><br />The things I have noticed are remarkable.<br />It has helped with my digestion. My tummy feels lighter. When I have applied it to small cuts on my fingers or minor abrasions it has healed them up in a day or 2. When I have poured it onto my plants they seem to come back to life with more vigor. Drinking it on a daily basis I feel fantastic and "energized" and if ever I am fatigued it seems to take stress and fatigue out of my system. I've applied it to my eyes a couple of times when they felt irritated and within minutes the irritation and redness began disappearing.<br /><br />I also notice that it seems to hydrate my body more so than any other water and I drink a lot of good quality 8.5 - 9.5 pH alkaline water. This water is wonderful.<br />Start drinking some and see for yourself!

I decided to drink Trivedi water during this time.....and it has been so easy.  I truly feel amazing.  I have also noticed a difference in my skin.  It's so worth it and I will continue to drink the water and receive all of its wellness benefits.
