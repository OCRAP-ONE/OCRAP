review/text: This is one of our favorite green tea's. We drink this tea every day, and Amazon has the best price for it, if you buy it in bulk. If you want to try a small sample of this tea (before you buy 1 pound of it from Amazon) I would suggest that you go to MightyLeaf website and order a sample, which is a few bucks.

review/summary: Demerara Sugar
review/text: This is an excellent product. It's a great tasting natural raw sugar. I particularly like the fact that, due to this robust raw sugar, I am able to sweeten my morning cup of coffee to my liking but with less sugar and that save me money! I also like the fact that this sugar retains more of its natural mineral make-up which in my opinion gives it a bit of a healthful edge over the more refined sugar products or the more questionable sugar substitutes. Also, since this is sugar, it is a product that most of us are accustomed with. Nothing like familiarity. The service is excellent as well. I have ordered this product several times from this vendor and it always arrives ahead of the scheduled delivery date in pristine condition. I have never been disappointed. Thanks folks.

review/summary: My dog really likes these
review/text: I don't think she quite loves them as much as Pupperoni, but my dog still goes wild for these when I give them to her.  The nice thing about them is that they're quite a small size (just about bite-size for a small 15lb dog like mine) so my dog won't get full up on them or try to take them off to bury them (as she does with larger treats).  They're great for training and seem to be rather good value for money.

I think that says it all.<br /><br />Free dog treats are always nice. And as another reviewer mentioned, they are a perfect bite size for small dogs (mine are 16lb and 28lb). This stops my husband giving them super long sticks of pupperoni (which he does if I'm not looking). I would buy these treats again.

review/text: I have 4 Chihuahuas and they love these. They have never eaten fish based treats before and at first they just sniffed at them.<br />Finally one took the plunge and the rest followed. Now they love them. They are of of their favorite treats.<br />They do not have a strong fishy odor and are about the size of a wheat chex cereal.<br />They are not crunchy but sort of chewy like a fig newton.<br />I got these free with a bag of dog food I purchased from a seller on Amazon(Coupon code now expired).<br />Unless the code comes back or the price drops again I'm not sure I will buy them again. At over $1 an ounce they aren't cheap.<br />Looking at quality dog treats $1 an ounce seems to be the typical price range.<br />I can't help thinking at $18 a pound maybe I should start cooking up my own home made dog treats for them.

review/summary: Great wasabi pease (definitely beats most of the others I've had)
review/text: I really like these wasabi peas.  I've recently purchased a few other brands, and this is likely my favorite.  They are crisp and crunchy without tasting stale.  I've tasted some wasabi peas that are so hard that you feel like you might break or chip a tooth.<br /><br />These have a great bite to them.  They can clear your sinuses in any particular mouthful, and they keep me coming back for more.  I can easily eat a whole bag in one sitting, but typically, I get 3-4 servings out of a bag.  What can I say, I love wasabi peas.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't like about these (and most wasabi peas) is that they are artificially colored.  I would be fine with these peas if they didn't have any coloring to make them seem "fresh".  Wasabi peas are wasabi peas... they don't have to look like they were fresh green peas with some wasabi slapped on them.  I'd love to find the Good Sense brand's wasabi peas without the artificial coloring.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase another case (pack of 12) of these particular wasabi peas when I run out, but I am still open to trying new brands (and there are a good number of brands that make them).

review/summary: The "Yucks" had it right!
review/text: With all the bad reviews, I still wanted to see for myself if this product was in any way passable for a peanut butter replacement, having shed 170lbs with a bit more still to go, I'm constantly looking for ways to eat things I like with as little calories as possible. Well I loves me some peanut butter, but with my new healthy way of eating, it's pretty much absent from my diet these days, even as a very rare treat. With that in mind, I figured what the heck, I'll give this a shot. Boy should I have heeded all the other posters advice! I'm pretty open minded about alternative or food substitutes, but this stuff, well "YUCK" is the word!<br />When I got it, along with several other Walden products I ordered from their site, it was the first thing I wanted to try. When I opened the jar it did have the look of PB so I was hopeful, maybe this WOULD be okay. It wasn't. The first taste was sickeningly sweet, almost didn't go back for a second one, but had to to see if what I tasted was right. Next bite was like an entirely different product. This time there wasn't a super sweet taste, more like metallic or something. After that I thought "oh boy" I think I just blew nearly $50 bucks on this stuff (all the Walden products I had ordered). In fairness I did try pairing it up with other things, since I'd read on here that others advise not eating it on it's own. So at first I tried a PB&J. It was just as bad. I tried with fruit. I tried mixing it with PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter and Powdered Cocoa Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz Each - 2 Pack as someone else here suggested (which btw is a peanut butter replacement I do highly recommend). I tried it after I chilled it in the fridge and heated up in the microwave. I kept waiting for any semblance of a peanut flavor, but it never came. And so rather than leave it sitting in my fridge for the next several months, which it would have been as it was never going to get used, I threw it away. It wasn't easy, firstly there was all the money I spent because I not only threw out the Peanut spread, I also tossed the grape and raspberry jams I couldn't stand either. But it was also that I WANTED to have liked this enough to eat it.<br /><br />I will say out of the products I've sampled so far from Walden, I have yet to try the mayo, ketchup, and bacon ranch dressings I bought, I found at least some of them were okay. I'd say the best so far is the chocolate dip. It's nothing like the consistency of melted chocolate, more like a chocolate pudding. But at least it was edible. The French onion dip wasn't too bad either. Thousand Island dressing wasn't all that great, but I'll at least finish the bottle. I also don't really care for the caramel sauce which I did have higher hopes for after the reviews it got.<br /><br />Again, I spent quite a bit on this, and it was pretty much money wasted, as I didn't discover a great new product and won't be buying any of this stuff again. But it hasn't soured me on still trying low calorie alternatives to broaden my diet. I just will probably steer clear of the fake foods, since with tastes like this, the best way to have zero calories in your foods, is to just not have them.

review/text: Imagine farmers on earth lose the ability to grow peanuts. And, 10000 years down the road, an alien species who never tasted peanut butter before tries to whip up a batch. I am sure the result would be something like Walden Farms Peanut Spread.<br /><br />It's not very peanuty, not very buttery...it's just the vaguest notion of peanut taste in a very foul paste-like consistency. The after taste is thoroughly horrible, with notes of shredded hubcaps and melted imitation Reeboks from Laos.<br /><br />If you are a dieter and are trying to incorporate some fun alternatives into your eating plan, skip this one. It's truly revolting.

review/summary: Creativity helps make this really worth while
review/text: OK, so I ordered this without any idea of how it would work. And I have learned a few things about what does work and what doesn't. First, put it in the refrigerator! That is the only way the consistency works. Otherwise, it has a very strange texture. But directly from the refrigerator it is a lot more like the consistency of regular peanut butter.<br /><br />Second, don't expect it to taste like peanut butter! It is a peanut spread - without any calories! I don't know how they do that, but peanuts have calories so this is something else. I tried it with some Walden Farms jelly and I must say it was one of the more unpleasant food experiences I have had. However, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are not the only use for peanut flavored foods!<br /><br />So I made a peanut satay sauce with it! Added some lime juice, some curry powder, some Braggs (soy sauce equivalent) and some Walden Farms pancake syrup for sweetener (best way to use that is to sweeten other things you are cooking). Heated it all up and served it over roasted chicken for my meat-eating friends and over tofu for the vegetarians. They all raved about it!<br /><br />So I will be ordering this again! Because I have more recipes that call for peanut flavor and this is the best way I know to add it to my cooking without adding all the related fat and excess calories!

I didn't even swallow, spit it out in the trash can. I do eat a fair amount of diet foods, so it's not like I was expecting it to taste like regular Jif, I had realistic expectations considering the nutrition facts. The consistantcy was way off. It was more like a Cool Whip type consistancy. The taste was not remotely peanutty. It smelled like oil based paint. Sorry Walden Farms, you failed on this one. I'm back to reduced fat Jif now and its the best nutritionally as far as the decent tasting peanut butters go. I really like Crazy Richards too, less sugar but a little more fat. But this stuff was nasty, seriously, just don't buy it.

Even if it were just pleasant tasting overall, you can add a teeny bit of honey or splenda or something to make it work, and as a seasoned dieter/calorie cutter, there's not much I can't make work.<br />The stuff has a gel-consistency, like several other Walden Farms products I have tried.  I put a small spoon of it in my mouth to try it out and INSTANTLY threw it in the garbage.  A $3 product.  It tastes nothing like peanut butter, or peanuts, or some imitation of either.  It's hard to describe what it tasted like.  Maybe if someone took Vaseline and put something really bitter in it along with some chemicals so there would be a long lasting aftertaste.  It was slightly salty, but mostly it made me feel like I was attempting to eat something not made for human consumption.  If you are able to put this in your mouth and not spit it out, you don't have tastebuds.<br />If you're desperate for PB as a dieter, try one of 3 things:<br />1. PB2 is apparently popular.<br />2. I used to enjoy Better N' Butter, but I'm not sure if they make it anymore.  It IS available on Amazon.  Not the same, slightly syrupy sweet, but OK.<br />3. Take a lowfat PB and cut it with something lower calorie such as sugar free jelly or sugar free pancake syrup.<br />Just whatever you do, don't try this mess.

review/text: I understand that certain products in no-sugar form can often have a different taste and/or texture.  There is no excuse for this.  Gross beyond all measure.  On the upside, it made me not want to eat ANY peanut spread/butter for a while, so it did indirectly cut down on peanut butter calories/carbs!

review/summary: Walden Farms is disappointing!
review/text: Walden Farms Products are nasty, tasteless and always have weird textures. Nothing they make even remotely resembles anything that they're trying to re-create in a ZERO carb, calorie, sugar form. I have tried many many types of Walden Farms products and have not found ONE that didn't make me cringe after I tasted it. BUT, if you HAVE TO EAT THIS STUFF BECAUSE OF A MEDICAL CONDITION (like diabetes), then you may get accustom to it. I just wanted a zero/low calorie alternative to my everyday items and was sadly displeased with the products.

review/text: Like the title says, I'm fairly tolerant of low/no fat substitute foods....I don't expect them to taste nearly as good as the original, but imho, this was SO bad, I actually ended up throwing the jar away (which I normally NEVER do with food unless it spoils....). I can't even begin to describe the taste...it was beyond chemical-tasting. I really enjoy the "Better n Peanut Butter" brand of low fat peanut butter.  Although it needs to be kept refrigerated (or else it can get moldy in a few weeks after it is opened), it is fairly close to the original in both texture and taste.

review/summary: A Good PB Substitute for Special Diets
review/text: Please note that his is not peanut butter; it is peanut flavored spread. The consistency is that of a peanut butter flavored ice cream topping.  Of course the consistency and taste are not just like peanut butter, which is loaded with fat and calories. If you have special diet needs and cannot have peanut butter, this is a decent peanutty tasting substitute. I used to consume peanut butter every day without fail. When I had to remove it from diet over a year ago it was very difficult.  This product really helps to fill the PB craving.

I was super excited when I found out that there is a zero-calorie peanut butter. When I bought it, I didn't want to admit that I hated it. I tried to eat it but I ended up giving it away. It is the nastiest thing in the world. First of all, when you open it you can see all the nasty oil excess at the top which just ruins your temptation of having this peanut butter. I hate the texture, it feels 100001% FAKE, It feels like melted gooey plastic in your mouth, and it tastes like a blob of yuck.

Thank you and again, my apologies."<br /><br />Walden Farms<br />1209 W St Georges Ave<br />Linden, NJ 07036<br /><br />I spread this on Wasa sourdough crisp as part of an HCG Very Low Calorie diet. I thought it was tasty..and very peanut-like for ZERO CALORIES. It is thin. Goes well with Walden Farms blueberry fruit spread.<br /><br />NOW if you are NOT looking for ZERO calories..look elsewhere. If you can spare a few calories try PB2...it is a powdered peanut butter with fat removed. (I have not tried it..but I expect it will be better...when I get to phase 3...I'll try it).  But right now I'm on a low complex carb, low carb, Very low calorie and no sugar diet. THIS is not a lifestyle change diet..it is a rapid weight loss diet.....then you slowly introduce carbs, a little sugar and flavor.<br /><br />Walden farms fits in HCG diet Phase 2, when you are restricted to 500 calories  a day. (Some HCG folks allow 600-800 calories).<br /><br />IN a very low calorie diet phase..Walden Farms products are great.  BUT TRUST me..don't even think about Walden farms ZERO calorie products unless you are on an extreme diet....<br /><br />I don't think I'd enjoy the sourdough crisps without something..so I view the Walden farms spreads as a nice treat. If you are on a HCG diet, buy it.<br /><br />Just found a recipe. 1 T. peanut butter. 2 T.  ground flax seed and 1/4 cup water (or splurge and replace some water with zero calorie vanilla, butterscotch or caramel flavoring). Heat water to boiling & pour over flax seed & "peanut butter". 75 calories.<br />Some eat this as a "cereal". I cut up apples and used as a dip.  It was actually more than I wanted for one apple. You can half the recipe.<br /><br />Hope this helps folks.

review/text: I am an avid farm of Walden Farms products. Virtually calorie free, fat free and sugar free, many of the dressings, syrups and sauces are extremely palatable. The caramel dessert dip is quite satisfying; the chocolate version is not bad. But if you are looking for a peanut butter alternative, this peanut spread is a surprising catastrophe. We could take the thin & fluffy texture, but the taste seems truly unpleasant. Another reviewer mentioned a chemical taste; I agree. One wonders who the tasters were in the kitchen.<br /><br />Walden Farms chefs---you can't win 'em all; take this product out of the line. It embarasses a truly innovative line of healthier products.

review/text: I very much wanted to like this peanut butter spread, but a positive attitude wasn't enough to overcome the many negatives of this product. I'd read the reviews and decided to bite the bullet and buy a jar. Product arrived okay and on time, but the aroma was industrial, the texture was oily and the taste was completely unacceptable. I tried it straight from the jar with a spoon and disliked it immediately. I did refrigerate it to try it the next day, giving the spread the benefit of a doubt that my "taster" was off. Tried it the next day and didn't eat a whole spoon full before I capped it, trashed it and considered the experience a lesson learned. To be fair, I've enjoyed other Walden Farms products, salad dressings, chocolate syrup and their spicy BBQ sauce are all fine. They just need to go back to the kitchen on this one.

review/text: I really really wanted to tolerate this product.  Peanut butter is a favorite of mine, but alas, I am a low-carb dieter.  I'm surfing the low-carb sites, and stumble upon this product.  I think, "Lots of negative reviews, but what if I do like it.  Hey, it's a matter of taste--and no calories at all...WOW."  Bottom line, I could not tolerate the taste.  My impression is that it tasted like a really bad apple butter, made with sacharine.  So, I hate to jump on the bandwagon...but there are much better low-carb alternatives:  sunbutter, almond butter, and even Smart Balance peanut butter all have relatively low net carbs, and taste decent.  I doubt anyone will come up with something that's low-fat or low-cal, and still retain the taste.  Sorry to say, but Walden Farms sure didn't.

review/text: Unlike many, I did not buy this product as a diet aid. I purchased it because I have medical conditions that require me to very carefully monitor my intake of both carbohydrates and fats, lest I want to find myself in for a Very Bad Time. As a result, it has been a very long time since I've gotten to enjoy things like peanut butter, jam, and so on. When I saw this at the local store I was excited because finally, I'd get one of my favorites back.<br /><br />How wrong I was. Avoid this AT ALL COSTS. I'm very forgiving with my special dietary products. Substitutes will never be the same as the real thing, but this doesn't even come close. It's not in the same ballpark, or city. It's not even on the same planet. The "whipped" texture is a sensory nightmare, and refrigeration doesn't firm it up in the least. The only thing worse is the taste. It tastes like vaguely sweet chemicals. There's nothing even sort of peanut-y about it.<br /><br />I enjoy some of Walden Farms' other products, like the pancake syrup and salad dressings. This, however, was $4 down the drain and almost the contents of my stomach as well. I miss peanut butter, but I don't miss it THIS much. It's not even worth putting in a shake or something because, being calorie-free, there's no protein in it to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />(I had it with the strawberry fruit spread, which is not spreadable in the least and is also revolting.)

review/text: You'd think all the rotten reviews on here would turn me away from the peanut butter!  I thought it looked like peanut butter.  Kind of smells like peanut butter, too.  I dipped my knife in to taste it and was prepared for all kinds of bad......but it's really good.<br />It doesn't stick to the roof of your mouth.......it's not thick like peanut butter, but spreadable..a little sweeter than the full-calorie versions I'm used to.<br />I tried it on it's own, without jam or crackers and I could eat a PB&J with no problems.<br />Thank you Walden Farms....I'm gonna save 1,000 calories this month with your help!

review/summary: The worst food this long time dieter has ever tasted
review/text: I eat a low fat, low cholesterol diet, and have for several years. I eat plenty of diet products: only artificial sweeteners, diet cokes, nonfat yogurt, sugar free syrup, etc. Peanut butter is my weakness, and when I saw this product, I was excited. I knew that it would probably not taste exactly like peanut butter, but hoped it would taste somewhat palatable and I could adjust any yuckiness myself by adding some artificial sweetener or other diet food.<br /><br />When I opened the jar, it looked like peanut butter, but sure didn't smell like it. It smelled like super glue. The chemical odor was overpowering. I wanted to throw it out right away, but decided to at least taste it first. I put a miniscule amount on the tip of my tongue, and it tasted even worse than it smelled. It's difficult to describe the many variations of disgustingness that permeated my taste buds during that millisecond, but after that moment, "PFFT!" The jar disappeared into the trash can.

review/summary: run away. far away.
review/text: please, for the love of everything good and sane, do not order this. I can eat almost anything, and I've always been a very adventurous eater. At 6 years old, I ate sushi, and every vegetable, including brussel sprouts. That is because all of these things were actual food. This "peanut butter" is not food. If you must, order it yourself just so you know for sure, but I threw it out after putting my finger in and licking it. I feel sick now....

review/summary: It is zero calories...
review/text: To be perfectly clear, this does not taste like peanut butter.  But, it is pretty close to zero calories, and with that in mind you have to lower your expectations.  Obviously, fake food is not going to taste as good as real food.  Real peanut butters are better.  However, for someone watching their caloric intake, it is a good alternative because it can replace peanut butter and is tolerable.<br />Side note: it is much better on things than when plain.

review/summary: DISGUSTING PRODUCT
review/text: Walden Farms peanut spread is disgusting.  Has the texture of something a sick dog would leave behind and tastes horrible.  It doesn't taste anything like peanuts or peanut butter... provides a mouthful of strange tasting chemicals with a strange texture.  The ONLY good thing about the stuff is that Walmart, where I bought it, will take what's left back.  Its a shame this review process doesn't have a 1/4 star feature.  And, Louise, my cat who loves peanut butter won't touch the stuff.... that has to tell you something... Right?

review/summary: Not a Stand Alone, but Good with Some Tweeks
review/text: I have to say, when I saw this product, I was excited.  I was looking for sugar-free peanut butter (which Wal-Mart doesn't carry) and happened upon this.  I bought a jar, against my daughter's cries of "No Calories, No Sugar, No Fat, NO TASTE MOM!)<br /><br />I eat it on celery and without the added flavor of jelly, it really leaves a lot to be desired.  However, when I mixed it with 1/3 natural peanut butter and 2/3 of this, I was pleasantly suprised.  IT IS NOT THE SAME, and I don't want you to think it is!  But, for a peanut spread mixed with peanut butter, for one third of the calories, fat and sugar....it is good and makes me feel like I am eating healthier!

review/summary: Worst Walden Farms product. Makes a lousy PB&J sandwich.
review/text: I love Walden Farms dressings and pancake syrup.  However, the peanut spread is the worst product I have ever used.  It is edible, but makes a lousy PB&J sandwich.  The spread is so thin it absorbs into the bread and results in a very unsatisfying "jelly" sandwich instead. I would rather eat the full-fat, full-calorie version of real peanut butter instead of using this product just to save calories.  At least a real PB&J sandwich fills me up and doesn't leave my hungry for something else.

review/summary: Not what I had hoped!!!
review/text: I was out grocery shopping when I came across this product. I got really excited to try it and couldn't wait to get home. I love peanut butter and everyone knows how high in calories it is so having a substitue for it made my day! As soon as I got home I made me a bowl of oatmeal and fixed it like I always do with a PB and a little bit of cocoa but I replaced the regular PB with this spread. Its was pretty good...not fabulous but definetly tolerable. A few days down the road I decided to make a PB&J sandwich with this spread......seriously took a bite and gagged. I couldn't eat it!<br /> I would say that it is ok if your mixing it in something but not alone or on a sandwich. I've also tried another one of their products but it tastes gross too. I hate to throw it away because I bought it but I really don't thnk I could stomach it again.

review/text: I actually go this at Wal-Mart. It's decent, I mean you can't expect something with zero calories to satisfy completely. I tried it on a sandwhich first which did not taste very good, I must say. It kind of tasted like I just sprinkled some salt on bread. BUT...I love celery, carrots, apples, ect. in peanut butter (which completely ruins the whole point of eating healthy fruit), so I use this instead and it's VERY GOOD. Also, I haven't tried this yet, but I bet if mixed with a Tbsp of real peanut butter, it would be amazing.

review/summary: It doesn't taste like peanut butter, BUT...
review/text: No this does not taste like peanut butter, but neither does Sunflower seed, almond, cashew, or any of the other nut/seed butters. If you get past whether the taste is similar to peanut butter, you find it's actually pretty good. Stop comparing and enjoy the product for its own unique taste.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it has a mild gelatinous texture. But honestly its barely noticeable - and what are we to expect from something with ZERO calories?<br /><br />A side note for use: I enjoy mixing it with a nut butter (I like almond but of course you could do peanut or any other). If you mix it 50/50 you've just cut everything in half (calories, carbs, fats, etc...), and it taste delicious mixed!!! Just a thought.

review/summary: For Use In Protein Shakes Only
review/text: I knew I wouldn't use this as a spread, but in protein shakes and therein it does the job.....makes the shake delicious, low fat, low cal, which is what I was looking for, since a 1/2 banana and regular PB just make my breakfast too fattening and calorie laden.  I am wondering about the ingredients, but since I'm also concerned about my weight, and finding ways to enjoy lo-cal/lo-fat food, it's a trade-off.  In anything but a shake, I imagine it would be horrid, but one tablespoon does the trick in shakes.

review/summary: A Little Miracle in a Jar
review/text: This "peanut butter" is CALORIE FREE for goodness sake!  Yes, the taste has a few ISSUES, but it still remains a miracle food.  When I first purchased it, I thought that I would have to mix it with regular peanut butter.  However, somehow (miraculously?), the taste grew on me.  I combine it with the Walden Farms CALORIE FREE jams, and I use it on a variety of foods, including salads. I believe that liking any of the Walden Farms products is less about taste and more about personality.  If you are someone who would rather have a dollop of high-calorie elixir than a bowl of zero-calorie approximations of elixir, then forget Walden Foods.  However, if a dollop of paradise only makes you lust after the entire vat of paradise, then head on over to Walden Foods and train your palate to appreciate the freedom of zero-guilt.

review/summary: At least it mixes!
review/text: This stuff tastes like butt... with a hint of peanuts. LOL.<br /><br />Honestly, my hopes for it weren't very high, what with all the reviews and such, but I wanted to try it for myself anyway. I like diet sodas and can tolerate fat-free versions, so I thought that might be the case with this. Haha, nope. It really just tastes terrible. The consistency reminds me of yogurt or pie filling, though don't let that give off the wrong impression that it tastes good, lol.<br /><br />BUT. It mixes well. If I measure 25% real peanut butter and 75% of this (like two teaspoons peanut butter and one tablespoon plus two teaspoons Walden Farms), it actually does taste okay, and that's about 45 calories a serving versus nearly 200. So, it is at least somewhat redeeming of itself in that sense.<br /><br />I recently ordered the PB2 powder because I heard it mixed well with that too. I will update this once I try it myself.

review/summary: Yay Rich creamy peanut butter...NOT!!!
review/text: I'm a fan of different types of nut based spreads(more like my favorite staple food everyday) . So I have tried sunflower butter, almond butter, cashew butter, honey roasted peanut butter, honey flavored in all types, and the list goes on you get the picture. After a while for my training I started to use PB2 both chocolate and regular type for there low fat percent during cut season. So I saw this I say I give it a try. I saw the massive negative reviews and ignored it and say I'll give it a whirl. VERY BAD IDEA!!!. I tried just a teaspoon expecting a great peanut taste. All I got was a mixture of salty and mushy buttery paste. I didn't even taste the peanut flavor it kind of reminded me of when you taste bottom dregs of a salted peanut bag.<br /><br />****HOWEVER, it seems after testing it out with my friends, family, relatives and strangers who came over to house that people who kinder liked salty foods(asked them at the end if they liked salt or not) didn't mind it or liked it****<br /><br /> Calorie free peanut butter...ha I should have known. Only PB2 comes close the fewest calories without sacrificing the taste. Now time to experiment more on this jar of oddness to see if it's possible even remotely make it taste descent.

review/summary: Not too bad, not great
review/text: I don't know what is with these 1-star reviewers who expected to be able to just shove this stuff directly into their face.  It is a food substitute, and if one knows anything about food substitutes, then you must realize that they're meant to be used in a normal context for that item.  Not meant to be eaten straight out of the jar, in other words.<br /><br />That said, it works fine on a bagel, or on a banana, but as some other reviewers said, it is a little on the salty side.  It doesn't really taste peanut buttery either.  It's a good spread, it just does not really evoke... peanut butter.  It's good as a food item, it is NOT good if you are on a diet, wanting to kill someone for peanut butter.  (Not the case for me, but I have other food items that do that to me.)<br /><br />I know that Walden Farms tries very hard to create no-calorie alternatives, and that they've succeeded wonderfully with the salad dressings.  Seriously, thank GOD for their salad dressings, because I love a salad, but hate thinking about how many calories most commercial dressings bring... but this one just fails it's intention.  I give it a three star, because it's not inedible.  It tastes... okay.  It just doesn't taste like peanut butter at all.

review/summary: OK -- for what it is
review/text: I've now tried multiple Walden Farms dips, dressings, and syrups. Some are better than others: for example, the Chocolate dip and Honey Dijon dressing are quite good but I wouldn't buy the Orange Marmalade again. I'm glad that I didn't read these reviews, however, before I bought the Peanut Spread. It is really OK when you mix it with sugar-free jellies and jams. If you can't give up real peanut butter, then don't buy this product. But if you have 90-100 lbs or more to lose like me, and you love the peanut taste, then this Peanut Spread might work for you. Note that I also use the fine product PB2 in my oatmeal in place of real peanut butter. Following some of the suggestions in these reviews I will try to bump up the peanut taste of the Peanut Spread with some PB2.

review/summary: Great alternative to cut with real peanut butter
review/text: I agree with another reviewer who likened comparing this product to diet coke vs real coke. No it doesn't taste like peanut butter, however, it has a compatible taste with a fluffy texture that blends perfectly with it. Another reviewer described it as being like jello. I would say more like a cross between jello and cool whip. I use it mixed in a 2:1 ratio with real peanut butter to spread on apples and celery. In a 2:1 ratio it works very well. To be honest, I think that if I wanted to eat it straight, I wouldn't find it very enjoyable. It would be like trying to cut peanut butter with diet/nonfat cool whip to stretch the volume out. Would you want to eat the cool whip all alone as a snack or on bread? No. The taste blends perfectly with the real thing to allow you to eat 2/3 fewer calories. This is a big accomplishment to me. Normally I take in 3 tbl. of peanut butter if I were to be honest every time I add peanut butter to something and that is with measuring. With this product, I am not taking in 300 calories for a small little snack. Instead, I am consuming only 100 and yet still feel full.

review/summary: NOT RECOMMENDED!
review/text: I researched this as a replacement for peanut butter due to an addiction I seem to have. I did not actually purchase it on Amazon because I saw it one day in the grocery store and thought I was lucky so I grabbed it. I rarely review products but this one was soooo bad I felt the need to so no one else would waste their money like I did.<br />The first thing I noticed was the texture. I thinks it best compares to packaged low fat pudding made with skim milk. I could have gotten past the texture but the smell almost deterred me from even tasting it. It smells like what would happen if the makers of PlayDoh decided to make a peanut or peanut butter version of their PlayDoh. Very odd.<br />So now to the most important thing, the taste. Not as bad as the smell, but definitely not something I would more than just taste. It had a hint of roasted peanut but that was really it. This stuff was just weird.<br />I swallowed about 1 tsp just because I am a trooper and I wanted to give it a fair chance. But the jar went straight into the trash afterwards.<br />I have not tried any other low calorie peanut butters yet, I'm actually a little scared to now. I usually have no problem with diet foods, sweet n low, splenda etc... but this stuff is just not for me.

review/text: It's calorie free, so it's OBVIOUSLY not going to taste too much like peanut butter.  Anyone who expects that is - obviously - going to be disappointed.  That aside, it does taste pretty good for having zero calories.  When combined with something else, like in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, it would taste great.  I even eat it straight out of the jar sometimes, hehe.  The only thing is the texture - its main ingredient, I believe, is cellulose gum, so it has a very gelatinous texture.  So in that respect, it is very unlike peanut butter.  But it still is a very good substitute.  By the way, I didn't detect any chemical taste to it whatsoever - perhaps the flavor varies by region, or according to different palates.  I would buy it again.

review/text: the peanut butter is not verry thick and it doesnt realy taste that good by its self, maybe if you use it in a peanut sauce on chicken or something it might be good.

review/text: I did not like this product at all.  It was very artifical tasting and texture was not good.  I'll go back to the real peanut butter thank you.  Shipping was almost as costly as the product.

review/summary: Never Ever Again
review/text: Regardless of why one would need to eat a low fat diet or low cal diet, there is no reason to suffer through this stuff. I bought it because I just love the chocolate dip (highly recommended- not plain of course) and thought that despite my initial skepticism about Walden Farms' no calorie line that it must all be pretty good. So, I bought the peanut spread, raspberry jam spread and marsh mellow spread and it was incredibly disappointing. I understand dealing with something that is a little below par in the spirit of losing weight or medical issues BUT this stuff is awful. There is a strong lingering chemical taste that - despite of others claiming the chocolate dip has, and doesn't to me- the peanut spread leaves no matter what you mix it with. Because I spent the four bucks I'm having a hard time throwing it away but the only thing that I can fathom even trying to do with it is bake, and I'm not even sure that would turn out alright. I will try that, but I think as far as Walden's line I'll stick with the chocolate dip and not venture to try anything else.

review/summary: Thanks God I Didn't Read Reviews First
review/text: I discovered this great product about 2 months ago and since then have consumed five jars of it. I love it. Hardly a day goes by when I don't have some. No it isn't peanut butter but it has a near nutty taste and mixed with some of the Walden fruit spreads (raspberry seems to work best) makes a great peanut butter/jelly taste to use on crackers, bread, etc. The consistency is pretty firm although not as thick as regular peanut butter it's perfectly acceptable (to me). The color is fine a bit darker than regular peanut butter (not that you can taste color - but it does influence people's opinion). I rarely take the time to write product reviews and was shocked when I came here to look for another Walden product to find that so many people had left negative reviews of this product and felt compelled to leave a more positive opinion. I think if you like Diet Coke and understand that it's not regular Coke than you will understand this product isn't Peanut Butter but just as Diet Coke is a good substitute for Coke and saves you about 200 calories a serving that this "Peanut Spread" is a good alternative to regular peanut butter and will save you about 200 calories a serving (2 Tablespoons).

review/summary: Ok, it's not peanut butter... but they tried
review/text: I love PB and can't eat it at all during my cutting phases because I tend to eat way too much of it and go over my calorie and fat limit for the day.  (It's great for getting the correct ratio of healthy fats into your diet for bulking phases though!)  I've tried other PB substitues like Better 'N Peanut Butter and PB2(PB2 is a powdered peanut butter mix with about 1/4 the calories and fat of regular PB, and it tastes just like the normal stuff) and they are not bad.  But I still can't eat as much of it as I want.<br /><br />As soon as I saw this, my first thought was "SWEET!!! THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE GOOD!"  I read some reviews, thought for 25 seconds, ordered 3 jars, and didn't really have too high of expectations since it is a calorie free product.<br /><br />Well, it kind of tastes like roasted peanuts... kind of.  I'd say it's more of a fake sugar/bitter coffee/peanut flavored pudding product.  If you can imagine the aftertaste you get from the fake sugar in diet coke, you can kind of imagine this.<br /><br />It's not a total failure though, because I am still going to use this, but not by itself.  I tried mixing a few tablespoons of this with a tablespoon of regular creamy PB and a little bit of PB2 powder.  The normal PB enhances the peanut taste where this stuff left off, and the PB2 gives it the right texture.  After all that, it's really not bad.  I'd even say pretty good.  Regular PB has about 100 calories per tablespoon and a ton of fat.  This mixed PB concoction has maybe 25 calories per tablespoon.  Not bad.<br /><br />The walden farms grape jelly is great, and does taste like real jelly.  And I'll use it with the peanut butter mix on light wheat bread, and you have a fairly good 200 calorie PB&J sandwich (that's 1/4 the calories and fat of a normal PB&J).

review/summary: WORSE THAN AWFUL
review/text: OK, I am very health concious and watch calories, carbs and fat content. I like regular PB very much but it has a lot of calories so I thought I would try this. Immediately after opening kind of a greenish brown color and pudding consistency. When I first looked at it my thoughts definitely were not of PB but something much worse. Then I tasted it. I would have to say that the taste and texture were the same as that much worse item that comes in about the same color. This stuff is totally GROSS. Do not waste your money. Save the calories and have the real thing. At least with real PB you get some nutritional value. I do think Walden Farms could market this as an appetite suppresant.

review/summary: This product highly offended me
review/text: I am on the Medifast diet, so was looking for a few low carb/low calorie options to add to my daily diet.  When I heard about Walden Farms calorie free peanut butter I was highly skeptical but decided to give it a try.  I have to say, that this product was probably THE worst tasting diet food I have ever eaten.  I am a huge fan of peanut butter, and thought maybe this would slightly resemble it, but the taste was nowhere close.  This product SERIOUSLY offended me.  I would give it to a homeless person, but I'm not that cruel.  If you're looking for peanut butter substitutes I'd recommend PB2.  It contains only peanuts and salt, and actually tastes like peanuts.<br /><br />Walden Farms DOES have good products, though.  I will say that their caramel dip is very good, but I wonder why they are still able to make enough money from this "peanut butter" to keep producing it!

review/summary: This is Peanut Butter?
review/text: I can't believe that Walden Farms markets this product! The taste is blah,the texture is gluey. If I liked pb cookies I might bake with it. I ended up throwing it out. I'll suck up the calories and carbs from other products. Truly disappointted as I use the WF salad dressings all the time (sometimes as a marinade). A big stinkofor the PB!

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: Don't expect to use it exactly as you would use peanut butter.  Just think, peanut butter is loaded with fat and calories and this has none.  If you want the peanut butter flavor without the calories, this is an excellent product.  I have just started using it to add flavor to my protien shakes (banana peanut butter flavor, for example) and I love it!  I don't know if I would use it to make PB&J sandwiches, but that's OK.  Now I can finally have my peanut butter and eat it too!  I'm thilled that a company has developed this product!

review/text: This product for all intensive purposes is a great idea! It smells like a peanut shell. Tastes like nothing...it would have to be an aquired taste to eat this regularly. So I am mixing it with real peanut butter to give volume but to have a better taste with less calories.!

review/summary: Really Tough to Take
review/text: It took me two weeks after purchase to get the nerve up to try it. Apparently my psychic abilities were working overtime because its pretty tough to take. A work mate said "what, are you crazy? Put real peanut butter on a lettuce leaf, a piece of celery, a rice cake, but don't even try imitations." Frankly, it was a waste of money because I put it in the kitchen with a note to all to help themselves...no one has yet.

review/text: I'm on MediFast, and a number of people use Walden Farms products to keep their fat/carb/calories down.  Like an idiot, I went to the grocery store and bought about 8 or 9 of the products that were raved about -- IT WASN'T CHEAP!<br /><br />This peanut spread is yucky. It is still in my fridge until I can think of something to do with it.  I don't want to waste it because it was expensive.

review/summary: Do not waste your money!
review/text: Like everyone who loves peanut butter. but prefers to eat lower calorie foods, I was excited to find this in the store. It is completely inedible. I cannot see how anyone could have thought this tasted well enough to produce and sell. I really did want to like it, but just the memory of how bad it tasted is enough to make me queasy. Instead of focusing on being "calorie-free" Walden Farms should reformulate the product so it can be low in calories, but actually taste good.

review/text: Don't waste your time!  This went straight in the trash.  It doesn't at all come close to the taste of PB.  I eat allot of un-conventional foods, but this was really bad.  It has the consistency of a mix between pudding and cool whip and a TERRIBLE after taste!  I really had high hopes, but for such an expensive product, I expected more.

review/summary: decent alternative
review/text: I am shocked to see so many negative reviews here. Are you for real people? To my opinion it doesn't taste bad at all taking in consideration that it is calorie free. I am on HCG diet right now I can't eat pretty much anything. It's not really hard to maintain myself on 500 cal a day diet, but watching my husband munching on all the yummies does give me cravings. Discovering Walden Farms products was a savior to me. I've tried about 5 products so far and I think reviewed a few already. But this peanut spread is somewhat close to my opinion. Now, I have to mention that it tastes the best with crackers or fruit, but not on it's own. It smells like peanut butter spot on, but taste is close but not it. I can't complain however because it's calorie free and I can eat it a lot, even being on the diet. Everyone knows that diet food supposed to be awful, but it's much better than that and guilt free.
