review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: When you think of what you could spend on junk for snacks at work, this is really quite a bargain. My own "research" tells me that soup helps cut the munchies. Bring a couple of them to work, and you just might be able to stay out of the cookie jar or vending machine.<br /><br />Of course it's not the same as home-made, but as a close second, Healthy Choice has the added benefit of great packaging that allows you to stockpile for those days when you've forgotten to bring other food and can't get out to pick something up.<br /><br />Healthy Choice soup is definitely worth trying.

review/summary: Best packaged Soup around!
review/text: I don't normally write reviews for products, but I have to say that I took a chance on buying two boxes of these due to price.  I was very shocked, and happy, with my first experience with this soup.<br /><br />PROs:  REAL white meat, veggies, low salt broth, great flavor.<br />CONs:  If you like salt don't buy this soup.<br /><br />I am not a salt fan, but I AM a flavor fan.  This soup successfuly removes the salt without removing the flavor.  I highly recommend it to all as a healthy, flavor filled alternative to sodium (salt) filled soups.

review/text: In less than 2 minutes in the microwave, you can enjoy a soup that has great-tasting chicken, delicious rice, and low sodium content; in doing so, you will make a healthy choice while on the job or at home.  After finishing this soup, your body will feel healthier than it would with high-sodium soups.  Beware of soups that have sodium content approaching 1 gram; instead, choose Healthy Choice's Chicken with Rice Soup and give your heart a break.

review/summary: Convenient but rather tasteless
review/text: I was attracted to the idea of heating up some soup as my afternoon snack rather than snacking away on pita chips and bought these from Amazon.<br /><br />On the positive side they are 1) convenient 2) just the right size for a snack 3) reasonably healthy judging by the nutrition panel (90 cal per 240g and there's 397g in the container so 149 cal for the whole thing) 6g protein, 1.5g fat, 13g carb 2g fiber 10% vitamin A, 4% vitamin C.<br /><br />For me though, the big negative is the taste. Despite the picture of a spoon with chicken, rice, and veges, this is not a thick soup and is 80% stock; this would not be a problem if the stock actually tasted like chicken but it doesn't. I find the whole thing really tasteless and I am disappointed. Maybe the Pacific chicken stock spoiled my taste buds but I don't like these at all and have to add all kinds of seasoning to squeeze more flavor into it. It is doubtful I'll buy them again.

I paid $18.00 per case of 12 on 12/10/11, today when I went to reorder the price had jumped to $33.21!  Almost double in a little over a month.

review/text: I was looking forward to trying this soup based on the excellent reviews posted about this product. Imagine my surprise when I opened one and discovered that 80% of the bowl was chicken broth--and not a very tasty one at that. The remainder of the soup consisted of a few small pieces of chicken along with a little rice, celery and such.<br /><br />There is no way this product is worth over $3 a bowl. This is one of the biggest ripoffs I ever seen. If you like chicken and rice, try Hormel Compleats.

review/text: The Microwave Version has 14 oz. The can version has 15 oz. It's hard to open the microwave can and a small amount is often spilled while opening. But you can microwave this product in the container which is convenient. The taste is exactly the same in both versions. I recently bought the can version from Amazon and most of the cans were dented.  See my review.  I've bought this soup at Safeway and Target.  The magic price is $2.00 per can.  Amazon often has it well below that although you always have to buy 12.

review/text: Autumn is a good time to stock up on a favorite soup of mine, chicken & rice. The Healthy Choice is lower in sodium yet still has flavor. There's no guessing involved when you taste it, you  know it's chicken & rice soup . I like this container because the only metal around it is the pop top so the metal  taste of canned soups is eliminated. I prefer to heat mine stovetop , the pop top makes it super easy.<br />I like that it is offered as a solo choice & not a variety pack because I don't care for some of the other flavors.

review/summary: Lots of broth, light on taste
review/text: Healthy Choice soups are not my first choice when it comes to ready-made soups. These are convenient to take to work, though, so I often pair one of these with some crackers or a bag of tortilla chips to round-out a meal. They're easy to open and heat.<br /><br />The Chicken with Rice Soup is a little light on the rice, however. This is not a hearty meal. There's much more broth than chicken, rice, or vegetables in the package. The flavor is light, and especially not as salty as other ready-made soups. The chicken, vegetables and the rice are of decent quality, though, and this soup almost always seems "fresh" after I heat it -- it doesn't seem like it's from a can or container.<br /><br />One plus - I find that the Healthy Choice lids are much easier to remove than those of their competition, with no strange tabs to squeeze or excessive force required to remove the plastic lids. Recommended for a light lunch especially when trying to watch your calorie intake.

review/summary: Misleading Advertising
review/text: I bought these because they advertise this as 100 calories per serving.  Well, there are almost two servings in a bowl which puts this at roughly 200 calories and 40 fat calories.  Plus, the chichen has lots of chewy parts that I typically would cut off if I were eating a whole breast.  This is very high in sodium also...close to 900 mgs in total.  This is anything but a healthy bowl of soup.  If you are going to sell food in a single serving size, you should only be serving a single serving.  I am so disapointed that I am actually going to take this product back to the grocery store and get my money back - something that I NEVER do.

review/summary: ANGRY AT VERY MISLEADING NUTRITIONAL LABELLING
review/text: The package presented, online, or on the shelves at the market, appear about the size of a large cup of soup. If you got a smaller portion in a restaurant, you would complain LOUDLY.<br /><br />However the misleading nutritional info says the "serving size" is 1 cup. PEOPLE, GET WITH THE PROGRAM! 1 CUP BARELY COVERS THE BOTTOM OF THE SOUP DISH YOU USE AT HOME!!!!  TRY IT FOR YOURSELF WITH 1 CUP OF WATER, AND SEE IF THAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK IT WAS  "normal serving."<br /><br />So, if the REAL LIFE FOR REAL PEOPLE serving size is 1 of their containers =2 cups(=16 oz vs a can of Coke@12oz), then the real sodium is a whopping 960 Mg, 40% of the suggested Daily Value (printed on its own can), and FAR, FAR, FAR FROM A "HEALTHY CHOICE"...And that's assumiung you have nothing else with the soup; not bread, not anything at all.<br /><br />I don't usually get so worked up over little things, but this is NOT a little thing, if you, like so many of us, are watching your salt consumption, just as a matter of general health.<br /><br />THE MANUFACTURES REALIZE THOSE AT ALL CONCIOUS THEIR SALT, WOULD BUY LESS OF THEIR PRODUCT, AND HENCE IN TINY, TINY, TINY PRINT, SMALLER THAN MY MICROSOFT WORD CAN EVEN REPRODUCE, AND"COINCIDENTALLY "ON THE BUMPY, CURVED PORTION OF THE CONTAINER, (MAKING IT EVEN LESS LIKELY TO BE READ), THEY LIST THE FACT THAT THE CONTAINER IS 2 "SERVINGS", AND ALLOW US TO HAPPILY POISON OURSELVES OVERDOSING WITH SALT, WHILE EVEN BE SO CYNICAL AND SLEAZY AS TO LABEL THEIR PRODUCT AS HEALTHY. YES, HEALTHY IN THE SAME WAY AS A HOT FUDGE SUNDAY AND FRIED ONION RINGS WOULD BE.<br /><br />GOD HELP US ALL IF YOU, LIKE I, MAKE THE MISTAKE*** OF EATING 2 CANS FOR DINNER WITH SOME SALAD TWICE A WEEK, THINKING WE ARE EATING HEALTHIER AND LOWER CALORIE FOOD, ONLY TO LEARN YOU HAVE BEEN POISIONING YOURSELF  (AND YOUR KIDS?) BY OVERDOSING ON SALT (ASSUMING YOU EAT ANYTHING ELSE DURING YOUR DAY!), SINCE 2 CANS, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A "REAL" HEARTY SERVING OF SOUP, IS 80% OF THE RECOMMENDED MAXIMUM SALT INTAKE- JUST BY ITSELF.<br /><br />I AM NOT SUGGESTING THESE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE TO CREATE SUCH MISLEADING ADVERTISING, BUT NEITHER ARE THEY EXEMPT FROM RESPONSIBLE LABELLING.<br /><br />BTW, THE PROBABILITY IS 99.99999% THAT THEY USE PRECISELYT THE SAME MISLEADING PRACTICES ON THERI OTHER "HEALTHY CHOICE" PRODUCTS. CAVEAT EMPTOR, AND GOD BLESS THE FDA, FOR "PROTECTING US" FROM SUCH DECEPTIONS.<br /><br />***I only learned of this by reading other reviews which alerted me to the deception. I am an MBA from a top university with 30 years work experience, and do not think os myself as either inatentive or uncomprehending. This labelling, you can be sure, has been tested through many consumer test panels-they know exactly what they are doing.

Two of us had the frozen hot chocolate (decadently delicious) and I broke tradition and went with the Trader Wic #1. A pineapple coconut frozen concoction equally decadently delicious. In fact it was so good we made a point of stopping by again for the wonderful desserts before we left for home. I was smart though, on my way out I bought the canister of frozen hot chocolate and have converted the rest of our family to frozen hot chocolate lovers.  So glad I can buy this online although shipping is pretty pricey it is well worth it.  Wish they would sell the Trader Wic #1 online too.

review/text: On a recent trip to NYC, I stopped by Serendipity 3 and couldn't help but try their signature frozen hot chocolate.  It was so creamy and decadent with such rich choclate flavor.  I picked up a few packets of mix before I left (same packs that are sold on here... they also sell this canister mix at the store).  I made one for the first time at home this past weekend and it was so deliciously chocolatey and tasted surprisingly similar to the hot chocolate I got in the restaurant.  This does not have a malt choclate flavor, it's definitely like a frozen version of a rich hot chocolate.  I think it's fabulous and would definitely buy it again!  You can also add a jigger of vodka or kaluha for a bit of added punch.  :)  Enjoy!

review/text: I live now in the midwest, however when lived in Connecticut and N.Y. I went to Serendipity whenever I could.  This mix brings back fond memories and the best frozen hot choclate ever.  Happy they are selling it in the large size. Now I can have it whenever I want it.

review/summary: BY FAR THE BEST CHOCOLATE DRINK EVER
review/text: I purchased it after seeing it featured on Food Network and the narrator stated it is comprised of 17 different chocolates from all over the world, I had to try it being a true chocoholic. I received it and what a great surprise, I normally do solid chocolate (from 70% cacoa to milk chocolate) not powder because it often lacks true taste, but this drink surpassed my expectations, it is sweet but you can taste the blend with dark chocolate.  I let my sons try it they love it too. The second can is on the way and it now has a permanent place in my pantry. VIVA FRRROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE!!!

review/summary: Chocolicious!!
review/text: I saw this product on Paula Deen's show and it looked good so I ordered it on Amazon right away and forgot all about it. It was delivered this afternoon and I decided to try it. I have to say, I wasn't expecting much at all (how many times have we seen something on TV, ordered it and wished we hadn't?) but this totally blew me away!! It's super easy to make and has a deep rich chocolate taste. If you've had the Haagen Daz amazon reserve ice-cream this tastes similar to that but has a longer lasting chocolate flavor in your mouth. It's a little pricey so I may save it for "special occassions" when I need a little chocolately comfort.

I had the Frozen Hot Chocolate at Serendipty 111 and bought some to take home.  It just doesn't get any better than this!  It is good in the winter or summer.  This is a must! If you can't get to Sernedipity to get the Frozen Hot Chocolate in person please, buy it on Amazon!

review/summary: Excellent-True Flavor
review/text: This is an excellent product, easy to make and true to the shop's most popular item.  I find it very difficult to get true chocolate flavor from almost any manufactured item, it always seems to be missing that deep flavor. I was pleasantly surprised with Serendipity, they nailed it.  The cost is a little high but I don't think you could do any better price-wise at home buying all the different kinds of chocolates used.  The best way to describe the flavor is  deep cocoa .  It's rich and dark, like hot chocolate.  It tastes nothing at all like a milkshake although it's is cold.  The canister is a nice improvement over the pouches, you get to customize the flavor a little easier.  Because of the cost, it's a once in a while treat for us and it is a favorite.  Buy with confidence, it's a delicious product.

review/text: When I got it in the mail, my first endeavor was to cover up the horrible pictures on the can.  Then my intuition said, "Put four walnut halves in the blender with the chocolate mix, the milk and ice cubes."  The blender completely pulverized the walnuts and the only thing I crunched on was tiny bits of ice. The walnuts added the most wonderful depth of flavor to this already remarkable product.

review/summary: Head Rush Frozen Hot Chocolate
review/text: If you were to imagine drinking hot chocolate in an ice storm, that might be close to the experience of smooth chocolaty bliss merging with ice crystals slipping through a straw and melting onto your tongue.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, non-fat dry milk, dextrose and cocoas processed with alkali. The blend of cocoa powders is especially rich and smooth.<br /><br />This is a super fast dessert to make because all you do is put milk (even nonfat milk works) in a blender, add the packet of cocoa and then blend with a few cups of ice.<br /><br />Within seconds of sharing this with my husband, we both knew we had been drinking this beverage too fast. Brain freeze! You can drink this much faster than a milkshake. You have been warned. It is tempting and delicious, but may need to be sipped more slowly...or not.<br /><br />Optional toppings include whipped cream and of course chocolate shavings. Sipping this while wearing Opium perfume is a fun experience. It seems to enhance the experience and add new levels to the chocolate perfection. Oh I think I feel a sugar rush coming on...<br /><br />My favorite way to drink this:<br /><br />1. Turn on heating blanket when the weather turns cold.<br /><br />2. Climb into bed wearing something silky.<br /><br />3. Sip away while reading poetry.<br /><br />So delicious!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

When I made it, exactly according to the directions, for my family, no one really cared for it. They would've rather had milkshakes. It didn't taste much different than making it with hot chocolate from our local grocery store. It was a disappointment.

review/summary: Delicious take on chocolate drink.
review/text: I like the taste of this product.  Using different types of milk and how your ice cubes and water are may alter the taste just slightly.  Topping your drink with whipped cream is a great pair.  I thought the price of this one canister was a bit costly, especialy when you add in taxes and the cost of shipment.  It is a great drink for a special occasion.  It may also be healthier for you than a chocolate milk shake.  There is a recipie for this on [...] from Serendipity that sells this product for the budget friendly consumer.  Taste will vary though.  Serendipity adds their own mixture of hand grounded chocolates.  If you go to their restaraunt, you may yet get a better tasting experience.  I will order this a few other times, but will mainly rely on the recipie on [...].  Oprah votes this as one of her favorite things to eat and drink.

Unlike other energy drinks that hop you up and crash on you sooner rather than later, this one lasts long without the jittery feeling and doesn't give you that huge crash an hour or so later. It made the drive back from Colorado much easier. The only problem that I have with it is that it is limited to where it is sold. But be warned...this stuff is potent so don't drink it in mass quantity like other drinks.

review/summary: Best I have had so far!!! THIS IS THE ONE!!!! GET IT NOW!!!
review/text: BE CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE!!!! I bought this at seven eleven in the shot first. The shot is great. Then I tried this, and this is great BUT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!!! I just drank one now and have no Idea what to do with myself. I am WIRED!!!! I drank the whole can, and should not have. My heart is skipping beats, for real. That is not good but I may have heart problems and will be getting checked. I followed the instructions on the shot yesterday and drank half at about Noon (Which I should have on the can today) and and about 5 hours later while I was still WIRED I drank the other half and It lasted until about 4 am...No joke. I did not have any heart effects doing it that way. This is my new energy drink unless one better comes out. I drink mine on an empty stomach to get the full effect and get it fast. If you do this, I can almost guarantee it will work! It is not as expensive as others, it is not easy to find on the internet neither! I will be stocking up on this, and I mean stocking up. I will be comparing the price on the net to seven elevens (Which ebay is asking $130 for a case of shots, and I can get the same amount at seven eleven for $95) and buy a case or two of the cans or the shots. This stuff is no joke, and I would compare the effects to the old 1990's Yellow Jacket Ephedra pills without the bad "Come Down". SPIKE, I got to hand it to you! YOU ARE #1. Man I am on CLOUD 9. I almost want the effects to stop, but then again I don't. Half can would be advised, and the other a few hours later. This seems to be better than the shot, but I don't know yet how long this will last yet. Will  try and update.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/29/2009: I bought 4 more cans today and two shots at seven eleven, and my wife had one today along with myself. I noticed my results were fair but not extreme, but I drank only half a can. My fife got the Lime I think and said it was like drinking kitchen cleaner and it had no effects with her. She was up all night the night before, so she was beat, but she said she got nothing. You at least have to drink it on an empty stomach, and try and stick with original. The shots seem to be better. It kind of seems like you certain cans are more potent than others. They may have been made at different companies, there for the mixes may be slightly off. My dad works for a company that makes Arizona Tea and sometime their batches get mixed up and they are made in the same building. It is just if quality control got to it in time before it went to stores. I have a few more, so I will keep you posted. I still say it is worth a try! At least 3 cans on 3 different days to see if maybe the first can may not have had less ingredients that what is supposed to be in it normally.

review/summary: Honestly...Average
review/text: After about 20 minutes there's decent wake-up call.  By the time 30 minutes rolls around the jitters start.  An hour in and you feel a bit scared at how tense and jittery you are.  It was nothing off-the-wall like having to run in circles or not being able to string a sentence together.  Sure, this drink gives a lot of "energy", but what good is it if you're too busy shaking to put it to use?  That's why I give it 3 stars...it's too much.  The drink has a really nasty aftertaste that takes about 5 minutes to kick in.  While drinking though it's sickly sweet and average drinkability.  I felt the effects for about 12 hours or so.  It was more "awakeness" boosting and there was no noticeable increase in concentration.  The energy levels became tolerable around the 6 hour mark, which means it'd probably be better just to drink a Monster or other ordinary energy drink.<br /><br />Overall, only drink this if you're either dog tired and just need to be awake but not mentally present or if you have an extremely high energy drink tolerance.  This one just feels like they wanted to make a product that you can brag about "surviving" rather than one that actually helps you stay functional after an exhausting work week.

review/text: Energy drinks like Red Bull and Monster only keep me from sleeping.  They don't provide me with any "energy".<br /><br />I have been nearly asleep with my eyes fluttering and struggling to stay open, and within 10 minutes of drinking this I feel wide awake.  I strongly recommend following the directions of half a can at a time to test tolerance.  They can make you edgy, nervous, shaky etc without proper adjustment.<br /><br />Zero sugar, zero calories.  Lots of B Vitamins ( 33,333%DV ).  Be sure to hydrate properly if consuming these frequently or before exercise.

review/summary: A lot like a British digestive..
review/text: These crackers are quite good, as other have noted they are thicker and have a more crumbly texture than the traditional Carr's crackers. If you have ever had a British digestive cracker, these are quite similar. Both slightly sweet, thick, whole grains, crumbly.<br /><br />When I bought these I was expecting the traditional thing flaky Carr's cracker. If you plan to serve these at a party, make sure to consider what you are serving them with. You may have to adjust the cheese/spreads/etc that you plan to accompany the cracker given its different taste, texture and structure.

They remained firm even though the dish had a sauce and the crackers were partially in the sauce.<br /><br />Very nice taste, heaty but not heavy, without getting in the way of what was on it. And whole wheat as well. Recommended.

review/text: I recently purchase a mixed pack of Carr's crackers on sale. The whole wheat was the one that disappeared first. It's slighty sweet yet has a salty taste, too. The texture is biscuit-like with whole grain goodness. This is a cracker that is all purpose and would be a good cookie substitute. I also think that children would like them.

That's the only reason why I gave them a 3 instead of a 5.

review/summary: Meh
review/text: So far from Amazon for smoothie mixes, I have purchased this, the Zola acai product, and Big Train Fruit Tea Smoothie Blast Wild Berry.  The Zola was my favorite product, I order it multiple times, but alas it is discontinued by them now.  Big Train is not bad.  This one ... it has a different consistency and taste than the other two, more like a sweet, thin syrup, than any kind of actual fruit product, compared to the other two.  Kind of like the difference between fruit punch and "nectar" for juices.  This makes a sweeter, but less "real fruity & not artificial tasting" smoothie.  That may appeal to some, but it doesn't to me, so my rating reflect my personal opinion.  But conversely I have upped the review by adding one star to reflect that this mix was cheaper (per volume) than the other mixes I've tried, so my expectations should maybe be lower.

review/summary: Best Pau D'Arco for Healing Tea
review/text: After much research on the healing properties of Pau D'Arco (Lapacho or Taheebo) I finally found one that is from Argentina, which is considered to be the most effective Lapacho Tea out there.  I am trusting that this brand is true to its claim that it is Argentinian Lapacho. Purchased because of its excellent "antibiotic" properties and because it is supposed to be good for those who are suffering from Candida Albicans.  My 10 year old who is always reluctant to having to take "yucky" tasting herbs, has been more willing to take this tea to help her fungal condition.  After just a couple days of taking a cup of tea each day, relief was experienced, and it has only gotten better and better each day.  I highly recommend this to keep in your "natural medicine cabinet."

review/summary: Really great cookie from a mix.
review/text: This mix is super easy and only requires 1 egg and one stick of butter. The box says that it makes 3 dozen, but these would be small cookies. It actually makes 2 dozen normal size cookies.<br /><br />I made this mix by the box instructions and then added a bit of ginger and nutmeg, half cup of quick cook oats, quarter cup of unsweetened applesauce and a quarter cup sour cream. This helped cut down on the sweetness of the cookie (as I feel most mixes are too sweet). Adding these ingredients produced a soft, chewy, somewhat cake like cookie.<br /><br />These cookies were not quite up to the same standard as some of the wonderful bakeries in NY, but definitely good enough for gift giving or a household gathering (far better than some of the mixes that cove in a pouch with a red spoon logo).

review/text: In contrast to the other review I saw for these Lady Fingers, I found them to be ideal for Tiramisu. My recipe calls for the Lady Fingers to be dipped into an espresso/Marsala mixture. If the Lady Fingers are too spongy, they soak up tons of the liquid, and have no real texture in the final product (not to mention overwhelming it with the coffee/liquor flavor).<br /><br />Crisper Lady Finger are ideal, and make it much easier to control how much liquid is absorbed. I'll be buying these again!

review/summary: Terrible Ingredient
review/text: I just received my 30-lb. bag of Lite Lamb and Rice Formula and can't believe that "powdered cellulose" is one of the top ingredients of this so-called "natural" dry food.  This food is supposed to be formulated for dogs, not termites.  I'm now stuck with a worthless (in my opinion) bag of food and the bill for it.  This was my first experience buying Diamond food.  It will be my last.  I'm sticking with Wellness and the other truly natural brands.  Shame on you, Diamond.

review/summary: Super fast service......NASTY CANDY!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00152RU2S">Rainbow Coconut Bar 24 Bars</a> This candy was HORRIBLE!!!! I bought this thinking it would be like some I bought at Walgreens recently and boy was I surprised! The ones I got at Walgreens were so soft and chewy, lightly coated with sugar and just delicious. These things I got from here were such a disappointment. Hard as bricks, coated with hard, dry sugar and actually tasted like sawdust. I took two bites and that was all I could stand. When the box came, there was a cold pack inside a plastic bag with the candy. Maybe to add moisture in the hopes it would soften them up? I don't know what I'm going to do with the other 23 I have left. Anybody got any ideas on how to soften them up? Maybe I'll feed them to the squirrels. One thing I will say on the positive side, my order got here in record time! Two days! Wow, if the candy had only been as good as the service.
