review/summary: Best sugar-free hazelnut on the market

review/text: This DaVinci Classic Sugar Free Syrup is great. I use it in my coffee every morning (when I'm not at the coffee shop). I bought the hazelnut flavor and the caramel flavor and both are very good. The Hazelnut is still my favorite. I signed up for a subscription and so far, it's always right on time for my liking.

review/summary: Won't buy this one again
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PFUNU4">Torani Variety Pack, Sugar Free, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>I probably would have given this one 3 stars had I never tried Torani's brand of sugar free syrups but Torani's is a bit thicker and lots more flavorful. I subscribe to the Torani 6 pack here at Amazon that has SF Chocolate, Hazelnut, Vanilla, Raspberry, Irish Cream and Caramel. I really like them all, but hazelnut is my FAVE, so I find myself using it all up and then not being able to justify getting more until the other flavors are gone. I cannot justify pouring something that's not "bad" for you down the drain. One day while in Sam's I found DaVinci's for about $4/bottle and you didn't have to buy 6, so I brought it home. I was all excited until I tasted it. It's thinner and might as well be vanilla. :-(  Needless to say I grabbed a couple bottles of Torani's while at World Market the other day for $6/bottle on sale. ;-) It may just be that "to each his own" thing. :-) After all the Sam's DaVinci is only $4 a bottle so it may very well be worth a try. If you like it, you'll save quite a bit. Enjoy!

review/summary: Arguably the best hot sauce
review/text: If you like hot sauce more for the flavor than for sheer hotness, you cannot go wrong with El Yucateco. This variety is 8910 scovilles, so neither totally mild nor unbearably hot. El Yucateco makes the most delicious commercially sold hot sauces out there. This one in particular lacks the vinegary taste of some of the cheaper sauces, and lacks the sweetness of Tabasco. That said, if Tabasco seems hot to you, you will want to shop elsewhere.<br /><br />El Yucateco makes several varieties of hot sauce (all available in a sampler pack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000GHNUE">El Yucateco 4 Habanero Hot Sauces Gift Pack, 4 Items</a>), but the Green Habanero hot sauce is one of my favorites. Perfect on eggs, chicken, or any grilled food---just really a home run. This is a hot sauce that captures the deliciousness of the habanero pepper without overwhelming you with outright spiciness. Yum.

review/text: I am new to the gluten-free diet world (baby just dx with wheat and dairy allergy), but I thought I'd give this crust a try because it seemed easier than trying to mix all the different flours, xantham gum, etc. together. I've never had gluten-free crust (or gluten-free much of anything before), so I was a little skeptical. But I was pleasantly surprised! The dough is really sticky when you are pressing it onto the pan, but the directions say to use wet hands (I didn't read that part at first and I put some extra rice flour on my fingers), and this really works for keeping the stickiness level down! My husband also enjoyed the pizza. I give this a two thumbs up because of it's taste, texture and how easy it is (especially for a beginner) to make.

review/text: Trying this product was my second time tasting unsweetened matcha powder. The first time was terrible; the brand I purchased was very cheap and the matcha came in individual packets, which was a big red flag. The power was grainy and extremely bitter, as well as being very dull in color.<br /><br />However, Gotcha Matcha is incredibly smooth textured; you can't feel any grainy bits when drinking this at all. Additionally the taste is delightful: grassy, earthy, almost sweet, full bodied flavor. The powder itself is very aromatic as well, containing a nice green color. Although it's not as bright as in the picture. It tastes great chilled or heated, provided that you don't over heat it; the tastes becomes slightly bitter in that situation.<br /><br />Overall, I would defiantly but this matcha again.

review/summary: Big let down
review/text: I received 2 of these with my first ever Omaha steaks order and they turned out being the biggest disappointment so far out of everything included in my order, for a few reasons. 1, the image is deceptive, because the stuffed sole looks nothing like the picture, but that's typical marketing stuff and to be expected to some degree. 2, these aren't really "stuffed" with scallops and crab meat. The stuffing is basically 97% clumps of flavored bread or something, and there's very little crab or scallops. 3, the ingredients. The 3rd most used ingredient in these "stuffed" fillets is, as listed on their website "INGREDIENTS: Sole Fillets, Water, -> Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil &lt;-" Which means, traces of trans fats. Absolutely ridiculous to find this ingredient in a "gourmet" food at this price period, let alone see it listed as the 3rd most used ingredient. I can buy 100% organic stuffed fillets from Trader Joes or Whole foods for far less and not have to worry about crap ingredients which renders the healthy concept of eating fish pretty much useless. Now, all that being said, the 1 I ate tasted fine...but the deal breaker for me was the traces of trans fat. But if you don't care about things like that, these make a fine addition to any Omaha steaks order. Taste wise, they tasted pretty good. I used a lot of lemon, so mine weren't overly buttery as the lemon probably minimized the overly buttery taste that some have compained about, which is made with the hydrogenated oils. I've been surprised as Omaha uses pretty much all quality ingredients in all of their products that I've sampled so far...except for these. I definitely wasn't expecting to see traces of trans fats in a fish product. I didn't even bother to check until afterwards because out of everything I've tried from OS I haven't even come across high fructose corn syrup...which is a huge plus. Neither HFCs or Partially hydrogenated oils were even found in their stuffed baked potatoes, which was a huge surprise as stuffed potatoes are usually full of both of those ingredients. If you can make a delicious baked potato full of sour cream, bacon, cheese, without partially hydrogenated oils, surely OS is capable of doing the same with these stuffed soles. And put more crab meat and scallops in there already. This product is perfect calorie/carb/fat/protein wise...but using cheap ingredients like hydrogenated oils is unacceptable in "gourmet' food imo

review/summary: The facts of my experience ~ so disappointed
review/text: I finally decided to order a package deal knowing I could get stuffed sole (scallops and crabmeat) with steaks as well as various other things. Tried the steaks first and while I was disappointed with the size I do say they are way more properly portioned than what I usually get. They are quite thin and are okay at best but definitely not worth the money. Next we tried the potatoes au gratin and I liked that they were different than the sliced stuff in a casserole dish I remember having as a kid (never liked them before) but these were potato balls and while they looked really good they fell short of what I was expecting and my expectations were not that high. One of those deals where the first bite is pretty good and it just goes down hill from there ~ by the time I was done with the first one I didn't care to eat the second one. They seemed like processed frozen food rather than a gourmet type item. I had just always thought "Ohama Steaks" and figured for the price everything would be that of a high-end steakhouse in quality but it isn't even in the ball park of a high-end steakhouse.<br /><br />So... what has prompted me to finally write (I wasn't going to) was tonight I tried the stuffed sole. I had one a while back "just to see" and while it seemed really bland it was so-so, so I thought I'd prepare a side dish (my own mashed potatoes) with it this time and give it another shot. (I'm a nut for anything crab and scallop.) Being hungry I baked 2 of them. Again I was disappointed with how bland it was but when I started finding BONES in my mouth that was it. BOTH of them had little bones.<br /><br />It was obviously a waste of time and money and I don't even care about the rest of the food. I may try to see if I can give it away. I am simply not interested and having paid that much money for this stuff and it tasting like some cheap clearance item, not to mention the BONES!! That is just not acceptable to me. I'm glad it wasn't one of my kids eating it.

review/summary: Good--but could be a little better
review/text: When cooked, the food likes identical to the stock photo. That alone is impressive.  The stuffing browned nicely, and the butter on top made a delicious crisp on the outside.  The instructions say to cook for 35-40 minutes at 375 from frozen.  If you don't cook it 40 minutes, then it is rubbery.  If you do 40 (I usually do 42) it comes out with a good fish texture.<br /><br />The stuffing is VERY garlicky, but I absolutely adore garlic.  It makes the house smell like you're baking garlic bread.  If you don't like garlic, do not order this dish.<br /><br />People are complaining that there are no shrimp in the stuffing.  If you open it up, the shrimp are very tiny baby shrimp. To do this review, I broke open my fish and counted the shrimp. I found 24 in my one piece of sole.  So plenty of shrimp.  I can taste them, but again--if you are not used to eating a lot of garlic, you may not be able to taste them.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this dish is the bread in the stuffing. It soaks up the water you have to add to the dish to keep it from burning, and makes it too moist.  The fish and everything else benefits from the water, but it makes the bread soggy then the cooking causes it to turn mushy. Imagine low quality store bought stuffing with too much water. The taste is superb but the texture is off-putting.  Even so, the taste and texture of the rest of the dish makes up for it.<br /><br />I recommend serving this dish with a mushroom risotto or wild rice pilaf.  Really good!

review/summary: Not food if you want taste and texture in return for calories
review/text: We received a flyer in the mail -- an assortment of foods, beef, pork, and these really awful stuffed sole with crab and scallops. Well, like a dummy, I bought the deal.<br />So, perhaps the truth on Omaha Steaks: The sole stuffed with scallops and crab is really a shread of sole stuffed with a paste which I am hesitant to describe. It is not good to eat.<br />When our package arrived, we selected two filets mignon, two sole stuffed with scallops and crab, and four potatoes au gratin. The potatoes were edible.<br />The beef tenderloin was too thin to grill, but we grilled it anyway. Awful. I have already commented on the sole.<br />Still angry 12 hours later (color me stupid does not sit well with me!) I re-read all the information Omaha Steaks had sent us -- and conformed my suspicion that no where do these people state the grade of beef they sell.<br />The quality of the sole stuffed with scallops and crab is perhaps compatable with a very cheap diner on the interstate -- "Well, you are hungry. This is cheap. You thought it might be good/interesting" OK/ We have all made those mistakes on a long road trip -- but to buy this kind of nasty food to serve at home  -- I don't think so.

review/summary: Biggest Omaho Steaks LETDOWN!
review/text: When my wife and I first decided to try Omaha Steaks (I don't know, perhaps we were bored) we didn't even consider what came in the package besides the steaks. When they first arrived I was honestly more interested in the package of dry ice than the measly 4oz bits of beef with so little marbling that they looked petri dish grown.  Also in the cooler were some small pork chops, white hotdogs, mini beef slider patties, potato nuggets, and two big balls of butter in little plastic bags. Upon closer inspections (actually we had to read the box) we discovered that there was actually seafood inside that butter.<br /><br />A few months later I decided to try one (I don't know, perhaps I was bored). My wife however was not interested in experimenting with me. Turns out in this instance (as is almost always the case) she was in the right. After placing the butter ball into the pan with the required 2 tbsp of water and placing into the oven, I waited the minimum thirty minutes. I peeked into the oven to find what looked like a steamed piece of sole sitting in a puddle of watered down butter. Protruding from one end was what looked like pre-chewed fish stick slime, and it was growing. I decided to give it a couple minutes, just to be on the safe side. Checking every two minutes I left it in the oven for the full forty minutes stated as the maximum time in the instructions.<br /><br />As I reluctantly pulled the Sole Stuffed with ........something out of the oven, I considered that HEY, maybe it will taste better than it looks.  The first bite I took was the "stuffing" smooshing out of one end of the sole. Sure enough, it was pre-chewed fish sticks! The texture was slime with an over powering flavor of flour and water. Yep, paste! I immediately abandoned the stuffing and attempted to eat the sole. As others have stated, the flavor was mild and nothing more than alright. The texture was rubbery with a baked on butter slime.<br /><br />Getting up from the table the only statement that came to mind was "at least if someone we don't like crashes a dinner party we'll have something to feed them".<br /><br />Honestly, you're better off buying fish sticks in your local grocer. At least they aren't pre-chewed.

review/text: Ok, I won't lie, my dad ordered me some of these for my birthday and I was a bit skeptical. When I thawed them out, it looked not so appetizing. I figured I'd give them a shot anyway. I served them with wild rice and green beans. They were delicious! I will admit, the shrimp and scallops are there, but a little difficult to see. The taste was wonderful though! I had to drain a little of the butter. I'm ordering more, these are perfect for those nights when I don't have time to slave in the kitchen, and chop veggies/watch the stove/babysit the kitchen.

I requested the company to send out nutritional information after my purchase.  It has 8g of transfat.  The sole almondine tastes fine but I would not purchase it again because of the transfat.

review/text: This gum is great! I enjoy chewing each new piece. This gum has taste of cough drops and atloids mints, so it might be a little strong and bitter for some. The gum is caffeinated, which is great quick pick me up. There is not a lot of caffine in the gum, but after chewing one stick you can fell a difference. The gum does some what freshen your breath. The only down side of this gum is that the flavor is not long lasting probaly after 4 to 5 mins the gum lose its flavor. I highly recommend buying this gum, dont buy just one pack because that can be expenisive. I recommend buy 5-15 packets to save money.I love this japanese gum!

Sometimes you get a really strong stick that you cant breath and have to spit it out and sometimes you get a lame piece that tastes like minty chalk. I wouldn't recommend it.

review/summary: Great snack!!
review/text: I LOVE cold applesauce and like to have it in the fridge at all times.  I also like it to be natural (no added sugar) and the organic aspect is good but not required.  I have been ordering either the Santa Cruz regular applesauce cups or Mott's natural applesauce cups from Amazon for a long time but they haven't been available for at least several weeks (maybe longer but that's when I started checking) which is very disappointing.<br /><br />I like the Santa Cruz brand so decided to go with this apple apricot sauce because it was available.  I looked at the nutritional info for both this product and the regular applesauce on the Santa Cruz website and both contain no added sugar and have about the same nutritional profile (50 calories per cup).  I did not want a much, much sweeter snack and thought that something with apricot might be.  It's actually about the same, and pretty good.  The apricot flavor is very subtle and still seems very much like an applesauce to me.  I would still prefer the regular natural applesauce if Amazon will restock it but definitely don't mind changing it up with this flavor.  Unfortunately, this product is now listing as unavailable.  Bring back the applesauces, Amazon!

review/text: I REALLY like these small, soft treats.  They have Pork Liver, Barley Flour, and Whole Ground Potatoes as the first three ingredients, and they don't have BHA, BHT, soy and corn.  In addition they are made in the USA which is good because I won't buy any food/treats from overseas.<br /><br />Taste:::<br />My puppies' (and the cat) love them and unlike other treats they never get tired of them.  In fact, there's something so attractive about the smoky smell that I'm now crumbling these into their regular pup-chow so that the odor is spread around.<br /><br />Training:::<br />From my prospective they are great not only because my dogs love them, but because they are small so I can reward frequently.  Also, they don't make a mess in my pocket.  I've tried a variety of treats and while there are hard varieties that hold up well in the pocket, my pups get tired of them quickly.<br /><br />The only downside I've found thus far, is that they make my pockets smell.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/critter lover

review/summary: Wonderful Cheeses
review/text: Everyone in my family loves cheese and we especially love French and Spanish cheeses.  We recently received this cheese assortment as a gift and we really loved all of them.<p>Our favorite cheese in this group was definitely the Manchego.  It was decadently rich and creamy and the flavor transported me back to the days when I was a student, hitchhiking my way across Europe.<p>Neither my wife nor I had ever had the Mahon Reserva, but we really liked it.  It's sharp and tangy, so we ate it in much smaller portions than the Manchego.  We had never had the Idiazabal, either, and I have to say this smoky cheese has become one of our family's favorite, rivaling even the Manchego.  It's perfect for cooler weather or to nibble on with an apple, a loaf of crusty bread and a glass of full-bodied Rioja.<p>The Murcia al Vino was divine.  This is a special cheese and one that we love sharing with friends.  All of the cheeses in this Spanish Cheese Assortment make a wonderful gift for yourself or for the cheese lovers in your life.

review/summary: not just a flash in the pan
review/text: I have worked with imported cheeses for most of my life, and it's great to see Spanish cheeses get their due. Spain is right up there with France as far as variety, great flavors, and quality goes. What they are behind on is marketing. Spain is where France was 30-40 years ago. Now there is a huge interest in Spanish cuisines -wines, tapas, and fine cheeses.The cuisine is large and complex enough that chefs will be playing around with it for a good long time. This selection is an outstanding introduction to Spanish cheeses.  Different milks-Manchego and Idiazabal are sheep, mahon is cow, and Murcia vino is often nicknamed "The Drunken Goat" due to it's milk and that it is marinated in a local Murcian wine. There are different textures and also different geographical areas represented as well. If you have any interest in Spanish cuisine, this is an outstanding launch pad to get you started. Spanish cuisine is not a new whimsey that U.S. chefs are going to beat into the ground.(Remember truffle oil on EVERYTHING?) You'll see Spanish products, techniques, and innovations for a long time. These versatile and yummy cheeses will get you started to watch the upcoming parade of spanish foods.

It was a mild day but not hot, and I'm concerned that the cheese might have melted on a warmer day or if the box had been out in the sun for longer than it was.

review/text: My iGourmet order arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The Spanish cheeses are expensive, but of incredible quality and flavor. A quick web search will turn up some fantastic ways to eat each cheese, ranging from marinated in olive oil and herbs (Idiazabal), to served with dried fruits and nuts (Mahon), diced and added to a tomato-based salad (Murcia al Vino), and even coated and fried (Manchego). I definitely recommend picking things that will highlight the flavors of each cheese rather than obscuring them, as these are truly delightful.

review/summary: Good but not Great
review/text: Tabasco coarse ground mustard taste just like every other brand. That is not a bad thing but, it is not a good thing either. When I saw the TABASCO label I expected a coarse mustard that would make my eyes water and fill me with sweaty, Hot & FIREY goodness but alas, it did not. TABASCO needs to bring a little more to their line of condiments. When I see the TABASCO Label I automatically expect to burn calories upon contact with the bottle and nothing less than that. So I can only give 3 stars for this particular item.

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: This one and the spicy mustard are wonderful.  Very full flavor, think Guldman brown mustard with a little tang and heat from tobasco.  The first bottle lasted about three days, I put it on everything from sammiches to chips and pop corn and strangely enough sweet apples.  It doesn't have a bunch of heat but can easily rival mustards like Maile brand etc.

review/summary: Tea so good, it is addictive
review/text: I don't go a single day without drinking at least one cup of Revolution Sweet Ginger Peach!<br /><br />I love loose leaf tea, and find that most tea bags are really inferior - you can taste the dry, dusty, poor quality in the cup.  But, loose leaf tea can be hard to make time for on a hectic workday morning, when traveling, etc.<br />These tea bags solve the problem.  The silky bags contain loose leaf tea, finally allowing a truly fresh-tasting brew from a convenient bag.<br /><br />Revolution has several very good flavors, but this is by far my favorite.  You'll first notice the smell: tingly ginger blending with fruity peach.  When drinking this tea around others, they often ask about the "wonderful smell".  That lovely aroma alone has converted several people who claimed to not like tea!<br /><br />The taste is fresh, clean, and very natural - there's no cloying fake fruit taste here, but it is naturally sweet and refreshing.<br /><br />GOOD STUFF!

These jelly beans are not only yummy they are also very pretty! The colors and shine that you see in the picture is only better in person. I was a little worried on how they would taste, but they are definetly the best jelly beans I've had, and I'm not even a big jelly bean fan. My fiance who is a seasoned jelly bean eater, also loves them. Now I can give the kiddos jelly beans and not feel too guilty about what they are eating. I would highly recommend this product and I will be using these jelly beans for all occaisons that I can.

I love the fact that Surf Sweet Organic Jelly Beans contain Vitamin C and do not contain any of the above harmful ingredients other jelly beans have. I liked the red and wish they added more of those to the mix, but overall the flavors were good. I am hoping that Surf Sweet will come out with the spice jelly beans made with clove, peppermint, wintergreen, spearmint and cinnamon.  Oh, and don't forget licorice.  We are ALL looking forward to those in the future.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Surf Sweet!<br /><br />Donna

review/summary: 5 stars only in bizarro world
review/text: A coworker brought a box of these into the office.  It ranks as one of the worst things I have ever put in my mouth -- and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />The first experience is not awful -- a pleasant crispiness to it, almost reminiscent of a Rice Krispies treat, but no flavor.  Oh, if only it remained flavorless.  Instead, my taste buds were assaulted with anti-flavor.  It took every ounce of self-control to not immediately spit the product onto the floor.  Overwhelming bitterness with notes of burned vegetation and industrial products flooded every synapse devoted to taste impulses.  As I chewed the flavor intensified, and the texture disintegrated into a strange, grainy pulp.  Anyone who finishes a bar must fight against their baser instincts; nothing about these bars resembles a food product in any way.<br /><br />These bars are, quite simply, not fit for animal consumption.  If I saw a person feed a Simply Bar to a starving dog, I'd call the ASPCA.  I can only hope that the other reviewers gave this product 5 stars as a cruel, well-orchestrated joke, and not as a sincere reflection of what they think food should taste like.  But what kind of person thinks that it is funny to inflict psychic pain on a person they will never meet, and whose reaction they cannot see?<br /><br />No, these reviews bear investigation; if not the criminal sort, then at least the sociological sort, where we reflect upon what we have become as a society.  The Simply Bar, if it does anything positive for us, will remind us that food should have a pleasant taste and texture, and is not simply the aggregation of its ingredient list.  Find a person you love.  Give them a Snickers.

review/summary: Can't get the taste out of my mouth
review/text: I don't do very many reviews of products, but I had to for this to try and spare others like me. This is one of the most repulsive, vile and sickening "food" products I have ever had. I know nothing about their other flavors, but stay very far away from this. It tastes like someone took whiteboard chalk, ground it up, put it into a kiln with coffee bean shells and "roasted" them together until they were burned beyond recognition. I can't find the words to describe the awfulness of this product. So I'll try a different method to describe it... Some of you may be looking at these bars because they are vegan. If you are, trust me, you will be happier eating a slab of baby seal which you clubbed yourself while kicking puppies in the face. I truly wish there was a negative star rating. This product deserves it.

review/text: I'm always looking for new options in the protein bar arena that aren't loaded with sugar and empty calories. I came across these in an organic health food store and am so glad I picked them up. I've only tried the Cocoa Coffee flavor so far but it was great. Disclaimer: I don't usually find the candy-coated, nut filled, gooey bars that appealing. So the light, yet filling, texture of the SimplyBar was exactly what I was looking for. This one is crispy rice with the pure flavor of cocoa (and not sugared-up chocolate) and a hint of coffee flavor behind it. I highly recommend it if the other protein bars leave you running for your toothbrush, too.

review/summary: Love these bars - you MUST try them!!!
review/text: I totally LOVE these bars! If you're looking for a protein bar that is low in calories and fat but high in protein, you HAVE to try these. In fact, try them anyway, even if you're not into high protein, because they're awesome!  The other bonus for me is that they are milk and gluten-free. But even if you don't have milk or gluten issues, you'll love these bars.  My other protein bars are so high in calories that I can only eat 1/2 of the bar at a time, but with these, I get the whole bar without the guilt! Plus, The Simply Bar gives me twice as much protein than my other protein bars. The other thing that I like is the fact that the ingredients list isn't a mile long with stuff that I don't even recognize. These are made with very few ingredients, all healthy.<br /><br />On top of all that good nutrition stuff, The Simply Bar looks and tastes like you're eating a rice krispy treat, so you totally feel like you're getting a treat! I love this Cocoa Coffee flavor, but I've also tried the cinnamon and lemon flavors and liked them just as much, so I would recommend trying them all.  I'm looking forward to the "sampler" pack becoming available so I can mix and match them more easily.  I'm in Texas and The Simply Bar is not yet sold in stores down here, so it was great news to hear they were on Amazon.  Enjoy!

We've tried a lot of pods and so far the one favorite is the Melitta Vanilla Creme Brulee, has a nice aroma, smooth taste and good balance.  Not to mention that for about the same price you get an extra box of 18 pods with Melitta.

Each container is nearly a pound of spread cheese and it works well for melted sandwiches and home made pizzas.  The nutritional content is as follows :  Calories : 90  ( for 2 tablespoons )  total fat 7 grams, saturated fat 4 grams , 20 mg cholesterol , sodium 240 mg , total carbs 3 grams,  0 fiber ,sugars 2 grams , protein 5 grams.  My family uses this variety more often than any other cheese as its versitle and so delicious.  Melts well in hot soups like the jalepeno variety too.

review/summary: Can't Say Enough About This Food
review/text: I have been battling cat vomit for the last couple of years.  I have tried many foods (Iams, Newman's Own, HALO Spot, etc.).  My cats would either not eat it or would vomit several times a week.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing.  My cats are not only NOT vomiting, but they are eating less, drinking less and are much happier and more energetic.<br /><br />Before this food, one of my cats had chronic diarrhea.  Since they started eating this (3 weeks ago), his stool has firmed up to some extent (not where I'd like it, but better).

review/summary: My cats love Evolve
review/text: I found myself in a long period of unemployment and had to try to reduce expenses. I'd been feeding my cats premium cat foods but decided this was an area I could possibly reduce expenses but still feed a good quality cat food. After doing extensive research online, I decided to give Evolve Maintenance Formula with Chicken Dry Cat Food a try. I've been extremely pleased and the cats took to it immediately. One thing I've noticed after two months of feeding Evolve is that their coats are extremely shiney and soft, something the costlier cat foods had not produced. I haven't noticed the side effects of soft stool that other's have mentioned. I'm pleased with the results and would recommend Evolve based on high quality at a reasonable cost.

review/summary: NO MORE DIARRHEA!
review/text: All I can say about this cat food is that it is worth the money! MY cat has been getting diarrhea from other cat food brands that had chicken by product and other stuff in it. I'm not sure exactly what was causing him to have diarrhea but since we switched to this food he has not had any diarrhea and I don't have to worry about a blown up litter box!! My cat loves this food and he is a very picky eater.

review/summary: Great Quality Ingredients; Causes a little bit of a Smear Issue
review/text: I've tried a few high quality cat food products and this one is right up there with Innova/EVO brand, but even cheaper in price.<br /><br />One of my cats has had urinary tract issues in the past. The Vet stated possible Struvite crystal problems which some lower quality foods, especially ones that use soy products, etc as protein fillers instead of animal protein(many variables in the low quality causes an offset of PH balance in their urine; Cat urine is generally more on the acidic side than alkaline) plus not enough water intake can cause urinary issues.<br /><br />Besides some few and far between accidents in the past 6 months, this product has delivered. It seems to agree with my cat's needs and has stopped her UTI's.<br /><br />My one complaint is how it tends to give my cats(I have two cats) almost diarrhea consistency excrement. It's not quite there, but definitely looser and sticky. Once in awhile it gets stuck in the hair, therefore making them drag their bums on the ground. It's not for lack of water consumption, as we do give them wet food also. They also have a great water thirst reflex(one even has a running water fetish!). However, we've had to cut back on that as with the combination of the wet food and this food, the stools get even more loose.<br /><br />My educated guess is the high nutrients with their consumption doesn't get fully absorbed, or maybe the high fat content. I can't say for certain, but it does it to both of my cats.<br /><br />In conclusion, with how healthy my cats are currently, I'm willing to put up with this minor irritation. I just stay nearby with a wet cloth and some spot shot in hand, *laughs*.
