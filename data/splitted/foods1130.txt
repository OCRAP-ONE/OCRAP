review/summary: good stuff
review/text: This is my favorite brand of yerba. It's a little rougher/stronger tasting than other brands I think, but that's how I like it. Hopefully 3 kilos will last me a while; it was a bit more expensive than I'd like to pay, but overall it's worth it, because I love drinking a good mate. Taragui is good stuff.

review/summary: Best microwave popcorn available!
review/text: I love freshly popped popcorn but we don't eat it all the time.  Popcorn is good for you but all the butter isn't.  Since I don't eat it all the time, when I want popcorn I want the good stuff and this is the best we have found.  Our grandsons love to come over and watch DVD movies and have popcorn.  It is kind of a tradition at our house and one that we all like.<br /><br />Each box contains 3 microwaveable packs and so you get 36 packages with this order.  This doesn't taste like theatre style popcorn, it actually tastes better.  It is easy to make and it is always fresh as you pop it yourself.  Just a warning, it is so good that you will eat more of this because it tastes so good.  This is a great product and I recommend it to you.  Amazon sells this at a good price and it also has Amazon Prime free shipping.

review/text: My daughter introduced me to this while I was in Cincinnati and I loved it.  I bought several bags to bring home with me to Tennessee.  After I ran out of it, I tried to find it here in Tennessee and there were no stores nearby to purchase it....so I went on line and found this web site.  I thought I better order a big supply because I didn't want to run out.  My home is never without popcorn and now it will never be without Jolly Time.

review/text: I have always loved Jolly Time Blast O Butter. It is now difficult to find it in the grocery store because of the change of the package cover.  Plus I have found that many stores dont even carry it.  So I was happy to find it on Amazon.  I ordered it but was very disappointed as it didnt have the same massive buttery taste.  They must have changed the recipe because I missed all the butter and wonderful taste. I needed to add more butter to the product.  Maybe one day they will go back to the original.

review/summary: Surprisingly Delicious!
review/text: I kept seeing Krusteaz Pumpkin Pie Bars in the supermarket because it's Fall and at first I thought who would buy that? It's probably really gross. I hadn't heard about Krusteaz before and the idea of making a pie (or pie like product) from a box just seemed off to me, even more than making a cake out from a box. Then today out of sheer curiosity I picked one up and decided to give it a try. The filling was very easy to make and so was the crust. I was still skeptical when I put it in the oven. My family loved the way the house was smelling, but that didn't mean it tasted good. When I took it out of the oven and tasted it, I was shocked! It was absolutely delicious! My family members did not know it wasn't from scratch and they even said it tasted like it was  bakery made. I have to say I'm amazed by how good it tastes. I'd rather make Pumpkin Pie Bars from scratch but this is definitely a worthy substitute and great if you're short on time.

Even my boys who dislike pumpkin, gobbled these up so fast that they didn't make it more than a couple of hours!  They really are that awesome but you HAVE to use whipped cream!  What a great effect! And, if you're not the best pie baker, open up this package and toss it in a pan. It's that simple!  Great, great product, another winner from Krusteaz.  Highly, highly recommend!

He is allergic to MOST grains and meats so I was stuck cooking individual meals for him which was very time consuming and expensive. This is a great alternative! Our pug loves it and we supplement the dry food with the canned version which actually smells like sweet potato! Natural Balance had been reccomended by a canine nutritionist and this product is wonderful. It has decreased our vet bills and the need for steroids and medications for allergies.

review/summary: Top Quality Great for Dogs with Food Allergies
review/text: Natural Balance has been my first choice I dog food for 15 years because of quality ingredients- no corn or wheat fillers- and the price is reasonable for the quality. All of their products are good, but when my Corgi developed food allergies to chicken and lamb based dry kibble at 6 months, I switched her to the venison or bison and sweet potato formula and she hasn't had any problems since. Plus she loves sweet potatoes so it's one of the few dry foods she'll eat. They also make a canned version, so you can mix in a couple of tablespoons with the dry and even picky eaters will gobble it up.

review/summary: An Excellent Tea at a Great Price
review/text: First off, I'm a BIG tea drinker, with my favorite varieties being, in order, Earl Grey, Lapsong Souchong and English Breakfast. And my reference points for what represent "great teas" are Kusmi, Harney & Sons, Taylor's of Harrogate and (in the case of Lapsong) Mark T. Wendell (Hu Kwa). So take what I say within that context.<br /><br />When I first ordered this tea, there were no reviews and I was a bit skeptical that anything at this price point could measure up to what I'm accustomed to. Well, simply put, it does. This is a very good Earl Grey. The base Sri Lankan black, while not the Chinese black found in most Earl Greys, is large-leafed and of a very high quality. Moreover, the application of begamot oil, while somewhat bold, is not overpowering. So the bergamot has presence, but not to the point where you find yourself wondering if it's being used to camouflage weaknesses in the underlying tea (a common trick). And as for the cornflowers...well...they don't seem to have any impact at all -- which is probably a good thing.<br /><br />Compared to the other Earl Greys I'm accustomed to, I'd say this is most akin to Harney & Sons' Earl Grey Supreme. It more or less shares the Harney's tea/bergamot flavor balance, but possesses a bit more overall punch. Whereas the Taylor's puts significantly less emphasis on bergamot and the various Kusmi Earl Greys offer more overall subtlety (which they should, considering that they cost 4-6 times as much).<br /><br />All in all, this tea represents a very good value. The quality is significantly better than the price would suggest and the flavor should suit anyone who prefers a somewhat bold interpretation of the traditional Earl Grey recipe.

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

review/summary: Sriracha is Hotcha!!
review/text: Wow. It's not often that anything comes along that just completely takes over my cravings.  A coworker of mine asked if I had tried these; she said it seemed like something I would like.  I had heard of wasabi peas, and they were okay, but I had never heard of Sriracha nor any green peas coated in the stuff.<br /><br />Boy, was I blown away.  I can't stop eating these things.  And at $6 or more at a pop (per 9.9oz can) at our local grocery store (Winn-Dixie, in the Mexican aisle), I might have stumbled upon a very expensive habit akin to nicotine addiction -- or alcohol.  Unbelievable.<br /><br />You pop these in your mouth a dozen at a time and your tastebuds are lovingly stimulated with a mixture of sweet, garlic-y, spicy delights.  They're somewhat spicy and full of flavor.  Who would have thought that green peas could taste so good!  I keep waiting for the MSG-induced migraine that just won't come, because I suffer from those quite regularly when I indulge in something delightful and sinful.  So far, so good.<br /><br />I've even gone online and found recipes for Sriracha sauce to try and make my own chicken marinade.  It's like discovering a new meaning to life.  Unreal.  Bought several different kinds of peppers at another local grocery store (Publix) and will try my hand at making my own sauce.  I am amazed.

review/text: These are some HOT and SPICY peas!  I love Sriracha sauce and when we saw these at Ranch 99 market, I HAD to buy them.  Hapi Snacks also makes wasabi peas (which I love) so I knew this would be a marriage made in heaven!  I was RIGHT!  The flavour and crunchiness of the peas still shines through and then the HEAT and flavour of the garlic-y sriracha hits!  BRILLIANT!

review/summary: Not hot enough!
review/text: Oh boy, I was excited for these.  Based on the review, I really expected these to be hot, a little scorcher of a product, break a sweat just trying to eat it.  Truth is, not so much for a chili-head.<br /><br />They have a nice sweet heat, about the same level as I would marinade chicken in, about a level I could eat a whole meal with.<br /><br />It's nothing compared to using a bottle of Sriracha on food.  I personally put that stuff on everything.  French fries, pizza, chow mein, mix it in mayo and put it on a turkey sammich.  I wanted extreme heat and based on reviews I read I thought I'd found it.<br /><br />They have a nice flavor, but I would've been happier with a hotter product.  Not sure I'd buy it again, doesn't satify my craving for spicy, which may be a bit beyond your average person's interest.<br /><br />For people who don't have a mega-chili-palet, they may qualify as hot.  Like if you can't handle medium levels of salsa, it may be hot.  If you like yours habenero levels, you'll find these tame.

review/text: These are so very GOOD!!!  I love the wasabi coated peas, but these are an exciting difference.  I can taste the garlic and siracha distinctly and it's a great taste.  Nice and spicy, but not so hot that it is difficult to eat as many as you want. I really love this flavor and enjoy the snack.  This one is a keeper.

review/text: Incredible snack.  Great kick without being overly spicy.  Nice garlic punch.  Very slight sweet taste.  The only issue is the price.  I have been able to find them at our local grocery for about half the price here.  And even that's a bit expensive for a snack.  I'd love to wolf down a half a can.  But I limit myself to small amounts to offset my afternoon rumbly tummy.

review/summary: The Cheesiest.
review/text: As I sit here, with a mouth full of this fine Kraft product, I can't help but remember that fateful December afternoon. The war had ended some time ago, yet you could still hear the resentment resonating through the townsfolk's gnashed teeth. Jake and I were at the bar, as usual, trying to drink away the sun. The barkeep, sliding a filthy rag across the counter, squinted as he tried to read our shirts. He let a grin escape and shook his head.<br /><br />"You got a problem, old man?" Jake took off his glasses.<br /><br />The barkeep ran his forearm across his wrinkled face. "Ain't no problem here. You boys have guts, is all, wearin' those Kraft logos around these parts. This is a Stouffer's county."<br /><br />Jake stood up, sliding his stool back across the hardwood floor. "If I wanted to choke down frozen food, I'd move my ass to Alaska. I'll take The Cheesiest any day." We used to call him Jake the Patriot. Always looking for a fight. I grabbed his arm in a vain attempt to pacify him. Looking around the room, I saw we were vastly outnumbered.<br /><br />"Choose your next words carefully, son. Don't look like you're makin' many friends here." The bar patrons began edging closer to us. There was a wild look in their eyes; the kind that only came from malnutrition. I felt a moment of pity for them. Who could deny the inherent benefits of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese?<br /><br />Jake discreetly slipped brass knuckles on underneath the counter. "You heard me." He turned, addressing the whole room. "Stouffer's is garbage." The patrons exploded. Frozen bricks of macaroni were tossed at us. We fought off near twenty men, leaving each one with regret. Jake turned back to the barkeep, spitting blood onto the floor. "That, old man, is why Kraft will always win."<br /><br />As we walked out, stepping over the injured men on the ground, the old man called after us. "You boys forgot one thing." He walked to the back-room door. "Mastodons love Stouffer's." He flung open the door and dove under the bar. A giant mastodon crashed through the frame, charging directly at us. I luckily threw myself out of the way. Jake, the poor kid, was not so fortunate. I watched in horror as the giant animal gored him with its tusks. It dropped Jake, looked around, and walked out as quickly as it came. I ran over to Jake's body, crying out. He looked up at me, his life slowly slipping away.<br /><br />"Keep up the good fight, buddy. Never forget what Stouffer's has done to me. Tell the world." He was gone. Since that day, a rage has been building inside me. This injustice cannot be forgiven.<br /><br />I call upon all of you to eat the delicious Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in memory of Jake. Tell your friends. As you're stirring The Cheesiest cheese into boiled macaroni, just think. One day, we will be able to live without fear of the Stouffer's Mastodon.

review/summary: SHHH! I love this stuff
review/text: I love to cook and people generally regard me as a fairly good cook. This is a guilty pleasure of mine. Growing up my mom would never allow pre-packaged convenience foods in the house so I tried this for the first time at a friend's house and it was a amazing. My friend and I used to argue over where we were eating. His mom had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E52WAG">Dinty Moore Beef Stew, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> and Kraft Mac and Cheese and everyone usually ate in the kitchen from paper bowls. My mom cooked a full dinner every night and served it at the table.<br />As an adult, I usually cook meals properly for my family, but the tangy familiar flavor of Kraft Mac and Cheese is still something I make for lunch every so often. It's fast and easy and takes minimal ingredients. I still feel like I'm being bad somehow whenever I have it.

review/summary: A classic and always in my pantry
review/text: My wife and I grew up completely differently, but we both insist on having this in the pantry for different reasons.<br /><br />I was raised traveling all over with a military family. I think every U.S. commissary has these familiar blue boxes on their shelves. Since my parents were always busy, it frequently fell on me to make dinner for my siblings and me. 2 boxes of this, a can of green beans and 2 cans of tuna wasn't at all uncommon. It's the wonder meal base. You barely need to know how to turn on the stove to make at least an edible meal with this and if you don't have butter or milk, it works just fine with water.<br /><br />My wife grew up with a mother who cooked dinner every single night. For her, the blue box was a forbidden treat. She would go to her best friend's house for Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and Dinty Moore Beef Stew. He would go to her house for her mother's home cooking.<br /><br />So it's there, on our shelves. For me, it's a last resort meal for when neither of us feel like cooking. Still as easy, as convenient and as cheesy. For her, it's still a guilty treat. Something she wants to eat when nobody is looking. She will also use the noodles out of a box for another recipe and put the cheese packet up for use on popcorn. That's not something I ever tried before meeting her.<br /><br />That's the best way to eat it. The noodles in a homemade chicken soup. They cook to al dente in about 7 minutes, so add them at the end. The cheese packet, sprinkled over popcorn that's shared with the person you love while watching action films.

review/summary: Good cheap mac n cheese
review/text: For all the store-brought mac n cheese brands out there, Kraft's Mac and Cheese is a rather tasty choice. The cheese tastes like real cheese, not the pale orange powder evident in quite a few other store brands. Personally, I like the Mac n Cheese in various shapes like Spiderman or whatever, but the basic mac n cheese is a good choice for kids, as one box can feed two to four people. Yum.

review/text: You're rushed, starved, and need to eat something quick...this is a perfect 'junk food' to grab.  While the noodles are cooking in the 'Fasta Pasta' in the microwave, I grab the fixings for the meal: a can of tuna, some frozen peas, diced roasted red peppers, and a handful of real grated cheddar cheese.  When the noodles are done I throw in the peas and let it sit a minute, then drain.  Add everything into the Fasta Pasta container and nuke for a minute or two and 'voila', meal is served.  Other times I will just add a squirt of Sriracha hot sauce to the cooked mac and cheese and eat.<br /><br />This is the comfort food that we have grown up with, just can't beat Kraft Macaroni and Cheese --- unless it's homemade!  Costco carries a large package of the elbow shaped macaroni and cheese.<br /><br />*NEWSFLASH* I just cooked my first box of this macaroni and cheese and it's not the elbow shaped macaroni that I thought I was ordering.  These noodles are thin and straight.  On that note-it's still delish!  I think I might like this better as a stand alone meal than the elbow shapes which seem better for adding ingredients to.

review/summary: Fills Young Bellies While Mending Broken Hearts - Kraft Macaroni and Cheese reviewed
review/text: Kraft Macaroni and Cheese beckons back to lonely days running home at lunchtime. As I lay heart-strewn and crying about the harsh rejection meted upon me by the fairest of the playground beauties, soft noodles in a cheese cream sauce would ease my ache.<br /><br />Daily, at morning recess, I would smile weakly and say hello to Heidi, who, in return would grimace. There stood I, in a pile of sadness, swings and slides all around, alone, and she, having moved on, would toil no longer in my presence.<br /><br />Today, all so many years beyond, I do not remember if it was her kickball skills, or the way she whispered, "Green Eggs and Ham," ever so flirtatiously, just within earshot. Her gentle words were never meant for me no matter how I thought her eyes caught mine, and with clarity, at recess, I was reminded of her tease.<br /><br />Recess would pass into lunchtime, and as the bell rang, I blew out the door and ran the quarter mile home. Anger, grief, all inside boiling, looking to be purged, pushed me homeward. Second grade happiness would be found where my mom made lunch.<br /><br />Resting on our kitchen table, steaming with freshly ground pepper, was the golden orange macaroni and cheese. A bit of butter and a few drops of milk converged with the cheese for the smooth-sweet-salty taste with which I could indulge my insatiated heart.<br /><br />My mother, forever smiling, and me, upset at Heidi who was forever guiling, until soon, I, with my belly full, was no longer riling. Fair maiden was never won by macaroni and cheese, but my broken heart was oft-mended by its flavor.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/text: I purchased this for a college student with no car who is living on a campus without a food plan that is located out in the boonies.  Anyway, she likes the Kraft mac and cheese as do my own adult children.  I paired this purchase with some Horizon milk cartons sold on Amazon.com and she was good to go for making her own mac and cheese in the dorm room.  At the time of this purchase, there was no Amazon option for butter, so she had to borrow some from a roommate until her parents brought her some groceries.  Happy ending, recommend.

review/text: While not made from fair-trade gourmet coffee, this "coffe drink" sure tastes good. It's the perfect blend of Coffee and milk and mocha flavouring~~ I guess you could call starbucks my weakness...Well . .Any type of coffee is my weakness (except instant coffee . .that stuff is fowl..)<br /><br />My only complaint is the $15 shipping cost . . .seriously!? That's almost as much as the coffee itself!! It's ridiculous! You're pretty much better off buying it from the store.....I did the math . .It's about $3.25 per bottle [if you buy it from the sellers on amazon] and that's pretty ridiculous in itself if you ask me . . ..

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: My mom loved iced coffee.  Living in Sacramento, hot coffee just isn't appealing when its 110 outside.  But you want your coffee fix.  So, she brewed up a whole pot of coffee using the 60s version of the coffee maker, the percolator coffee maker.  The coffee wasn't that good, but you could make a lot of it, and then refrigerate it, pour it over ice, and sweeten and cream it to taste.  Yumm!<br /><br />Starbucks makes it easier.  You just purchase the Frappuccino Mocha, pop it into the refrigerator, let it cool down, pour it over ice, and you have delicious iced coffee, sweetened and creamed just how I like it.<br /><br />What's not to like?  It is expensive.  But I suppose when you add in the cost of the half-n-half, the coffee, the sugar, and the time to make it, it's not that bad.  It's really more of an indulgence than a necessity.  I like to have a couple of bottles in the 'fridge during the summer, for those times when I want something cold to drink, but don't want to have a soft drink.  Iced coffee sometimes is just what you want.<br /><br />Moderately Highly Recommended.  Five stars for taste, five stars for the convenience, three stars for the price.  Over-all, a winner.

review/summary: Nipples not included
review/text: We bought these for a plane trip, thinking it would be very handy not to have to mix formula or carry dirty bottles around.  The problem with these is that they don't include any disposable nipples, and the nipples from the bottles we use (NUK) don't fit these bottles, nor are the disposable nipples easily available.  They aren't made by similac, only enfamil for one thing, and enfamil only sells them in very large quantities which other people repackage in small quantities at ridiculous prices.  I did eventually learn that the baby's old medela nipples do fit these bottles, but it was a real hassle to figure all of this out.  I even contacted the company and they gave me very vague unhelpful advice.  At the very least I wish all of this was made clear in the product description!

review/summary: Brownie mixes are NOT all alike
review/text: Truly homemade brownies are great, of course, but there are times (more than I care to admit) when I suddenly have a craving for some chocolate, & the brownie form thereof is preferred, but I simply don't care to take the time & engage in the effort associated with 'from scratch' (besides, I don't always have the chocolate [let alone various other] ingredients for such on hand [& to an extent, that's intentional]).<br /><br />So, what 'feeding a brownie craving' usually comes down to, for me, is to grab a box of this terrific brownie mix (& no other, at this point [it's simply that good]), throw in the specified egg, vegetable oil, & water, & then after stirring, I pour it into what I now think of as a 'magic', insulated, small, (& non-stick) square metal pan (& for what it's worth, I do notice a definite 'optimized' outcome when baking this in an insulated pan), & then partake of the delicious goodness approximately 40 minutes later (I bake it for 33 minutes [extra time due to the type of pan], turn off the oven & let them stay in for another 2 minutes, & then after approximately 5 minutes outside of the oven, I take a silicone spatula to it, & 'begin extracting' ;) [an interesting 'benefit' to marking the pieces with a somewhat firm & relatively slim silicone spatula, is that it 'wraps' the top 'edges' slightly, so there are no crumb-like anythings which get separated from the piece, & to boot, the top edges of the pieces end up looking more 'neat' (though don't get me wrong, I also love the more 'crisp-ish'-along-the-top -type 'edge' often found with homemade brownies, & that often have a kind of looks-like-the-top-of-a-pie-crust -type top layer)]).<br /><br />For my first taste, I don't wait for these to completely cool (nowhere near), & despite my removing the first piece only ~5 minutes post-oven, the piece stays together (enough for 'transport', & with 'help'/support from the silicone spatula) (& vs. being a kind of semi-solid that breaks up like crazy wherever pressure occurred during 'lift-off'), & the cohesion isn't stiff, & it's not lava-like -- it's got that recognizable moist aspect that gives it a ~cake-like appeal (though it ends up having a 'thicker' texture than a cake would [these are brownies, afterall]).<br /><br />Honestly, I marvel at both the taste & texture of the brownies made from this mix -- they're terrific, & I'd prefer these brownies to most others, without a doubt (& yes, I'm also including 'from scratch' homemade, when I say that) -- the outcome produced in conjunction with this mix is close to the perfect balance for me of the major 'factors' associated with the 'brownie experience' -- namely, a wonderful & chocolatey-fudge taste, a moist & 'just right' chewy texture, & importantly, the repeatability of my being able to 'reproduce' the result over & over, each time I utilize the mix.<br /><br />That being said, I cannot overstate the importance of that insulated metal pan to the delectably optimized outcome I've experienced with this mix -- I've baked this with a glass pan, & with a standard metal pan, as well, & although the brownies tasted very good, the result from those wasn't as 'even' as that found with an insulated metal pan, & they were definitely not as moist (though their extra chewiness was also welcome, & if I let the insulated pan -made brownies cool long enough, they also have a chewiness that differs from the hot-off-the-presses outcome I am at times partial to, & seem to simply 'go for' when in the throes of a brownie craving [part of the reason for which is that this more cake-like brownie experience (in cutting a few pieces while still quite warm [though not steaming hot] ends up making for a great base beneath the all natural canned-in-a-jar cherry pie mix topping that has become a yummy addition for any while-still-quite-warm brownie slices I decide to enjoy 'first' [& when I have any of the brownie slices in their otherwise preferred 'au natural' form, they taste terrific whether still warm, or whether cooled & at room temp, & whether same day or next]).<br /><br />The manufacturer of this product has kept the 'customer contribution to the mix composition' aspect to a minimum, but not at the expense of the mix subsequently having a bunch of artificial whatnot in the place of would-be-used-with-a-scratch-recipe ingredients (although, to be clear, the cocoa powder used in the mix does get 'fancied up' a tad, what with the manufacturer also including some powdered sugar in the mix [& I mention this only to point out that although it isn't 'artificial', it isn't always included by folks in a to-make-from-scratch brownie recipe (regardless, if it's part of the ingredient 'choir' of this mix, & knowing what I do about the outcome, I appreciate its 'voice')]).<br /><br />The picture associated with this listing of the product doesn't happen to show what is printed on the very top (you can see a hint of such, though it's hard to read in the existing image), but what it says is, "Premium Brownie Mix" & then beneath that, "No Preservatives".<br /><br />The brownies I make from this mix -- & which I bake (& exclusively, at this point) in an insulated metal pan (I truly cannot overstate the importance of this aspect, or the amazing difference that this pan makes) do not end up in any way reminding me of what I have come to think of as a 'made from a box' taste (or 'look') otherwise typically encountered with off-a-shelf boxed mixes.  The magic produced by pairing this mix, & the minimal additional ingredients called for, with an insulated metal pan, results in something that many might think was homemade, but regardless, many would find to be delicious.<br /><br />With all due respect to -- and in addition to how much I love -- the wonderful homemade brownies made by my grandmother, & by my mother, I hereby profess food-love for the brownies I can make with this mix...

The price is a bit expensive comparing with other brands, so I recommend to buy in ebay coupons for this food.  I buy get $3.00 off for any bag.  Petsmart sells a 5 lbs. bag @ $9.29, but Aubuchon sells their @ $7.99.  Check your local distributors for prices.  They also have a frequent buyer program (buy 10 and get 1 free).

However, I seem to only taste the cranberries and the sugar.  Further, there are off-putting bits of cranberry skins throughout.  I truly feel that cranberries should be listed first, followed by sugar, then followed by the rest of the berries, as that is how I seem to taste them.

review/text: Just so everyone understands where I am coming from here, I live in Seattle. Seattle is one of the most amazing places in the country for coffee (I don't care what people say about Portland!), and only the best of the best can succeed in this city. Caffe Vita is slowly becoming the preeminent roaster in the city. Everywhere I look, every little restaurant and bar I go to, is serving Caffe Vita. In the hometown of Starbucks, it is refreshing to see such loyalty to taste and local business.<br /><br />Every one the Vita's coffees tastes fresh and unique, without any unneeded flavoring or extra roasting that gives a burnt flavor over the actual coffee taste. This coffee, the Caffe Luna, is above even Caffe Vita's high standards. This is a mix of coffees from the darkest of Vita's selections, and I can't possible express in words how much I love this sinfully decadent liquid.<br /><br />And now I can have this delivered to my door in a matter of days?!?! Holy Crap! I guess I'll just have to fall in love with the dark side of coffee over and over again...<br /><br />Scott

However, using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CFSS5">Bialetti Moka Express 9-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker</a> has made the coffee taste even better - yes, even better than Aero or french pressed.<br />Also, the Jammin Java has become a true disappointment as their recent batches have been terrible.<br /><br />I've become a coffee lover over the last decade.  Living in Seattle really makes you crave for a good cup of coffee.<br />Starbucks coffee is about 6 of 10 in my scale and this coffee can be rated 9. (Note: I've tried starbucks in different cities and for perhaps an understandable reason, Seattle Starbucks baristas makes much better coffees than other cities')<br />I've tried Boca Java, 1000 faces and many others.  The only other coffee that comes a bit close is Jammin Java Lion Blend.<br /><br />Caffe Vita Luna french pressed or Aero pressed will truly impress you, guaranteed.<br />You won't be disappointed.

I am sure he meant straight green tea.<br />  However, although Lipton Green Tea with Citrus has a nice, crisp taste to it, this contains the High Corn Frutose Syrup that talk show host, Bill Maher, has quibbled "will kill all of us".<br />  All soda pop products contain the corn syrup and citric acid. In fact, this product contains no juice, but the sodium level is 70 mg and the sugars are 21 grams, but natural flavors are added.<br />To try and make this product so really good, they have added a label "AOX"--Naturally Protective Antioxidants--72 mg of flavonoid antioxidants per serving.<br />  Are we actually just drinking high frutose corn syrup--flavored?<br />  Making your own straight green tea would be best.<br />  It might be alright to drink this product once in a while.

review/summary: Artificial and doesn't taste like green tea at all
review/text: Eager to jump on the green tea bandwagon, Unilever has created this awful chemical concoction and is marketing it as a healthy drink. If there is green tea in here, I cannot taste it. The distinctive and delicate flavor of green tea is completely masked by sweeteners and additives. All I taste is sugar, making this no better for you than any other sugary drink in the supermarket beverage aisle. Green tea is naturally greenish-yellow and you should have to do nothing else to it except bottle it and sell it. If you have to put dyes and colors in here (caramel color, FD&C Yellow #5, Blue #1), you are doing something very wrong. Whatever health benefits you might obtain from drinking green tea is negated by all the HFCS, preservatives, artificial colors, and junk Lipton has put in here.<br /><br />From Lipton's website, the ingredients in here: Water, high fructose corn syrup, natural flavor, citric acid, sodium hexametaphosphate (to protect flavor), green tea, ascorbic acid (to protect flavor), phosphoric acid, potassium sorbate (preserves freshness), potassium cinnamate (preserves freshness), honey, calcium disodium edta (to protect flavor), caramel color, yellow 5, blue 1. Ingredients are listed in order of most to least. "Green tea" isn't until the 6th item into the list. Why 2 food colorants in here? Because blue and yellow make green, like we were taught in nursery school. The "green" in this green tea is from chemicals, not natural pigments present in the tea.<br /><br />Green tea is naturally beneficial for you and should be incorporated into a daily lifestyle (improves cardiovascular health, fights cancer), but not this product. Do not be fooled by bottle's health claims or pretty green design. There are no less than 4 artificial preservatives in here and you are getting little more than colored sugary water. It also contains no fruit juice (as written on the label), so the citrus flavor is derived from something other than lemons and limes.<br /><br />In tea drinking cultures, green tea is almost always served unsweetened, either hot or cold. It has 0 calories and is loaded with Vitamin C. If you want to enjoy a truly healthy green tea, you can easily brew your own and refrigerate. You can sweeten with honey as desired. A wonderful brand available at Costco and Amazon is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WB1YSE">Kirkland Signature Ito En Matcha Blend (Green Tea), 100% Japanese Green Tea Leaves, 100 Tea Bags</a>. Shoppers living near Asian stores will find boxes of bagged and loose leaf green teas for approx $2-10 depending on the size and quality.<br /><br />Avoid this tea. It's just bad, unless all you want is an overly-sweet beverage to quench your thirst. But even then there are better all-natural alternatives, like Arizona Ice Tea and Snapple.

review/text: Nope, real italian...  I use this for a Fettuccine Marsala that my wife just loves...  Season lightly floured beef chicken or seafood (shrimp is a favorite) with tuscan blend, saute in olive oil then deglaze the pan with Marsala wine as it reduces add more tuscan blen, once the wine reduces add heavy whipping cream and reduce till it coats a spoon.  serve over Fettuccine noodles and call it heaven.<br /><br />This is one of my favorites.

review/summary: My Dog Loves It
review/text: Her's my problem with people like the previous reviewer. I don't need your novice, pseudo medical opinion for a product you have not tried. You are as bad as the people that review a recipe after they change 6 ingredients and then say it was just okay. They didn't review the recipe at hand! I digress... The company has been making this stuff for over 30 years and have not seen any issues or side effects. In fact, dogs and cats seem to love it and they seem happier with better coats. From the Avoderm website:<br /><br />"SAFETY<br />You can feel quite confident in AvoDerm� pet products safety and nutritional value. In the over 30 years since Breeder's Choice first introduced this product line, millions of dogs and cats worldwide have consumed AvoDerm� with no negative reactions from avocado oil or meal.<br /><br />AvoDerm� pet products use only carefully selected suppliers of avocado meal and avocado oil. Years of problem-free consumption of these products indicate that AvoDerm products are not only safe for dogs and cats, but also provide vital nutrients for them.<br /><br />Concern has been expressed by the ASPCA about the consumption of the leaves, fruit, bark, and stems from the avocado tree, with the exception of the avocado fruit which is used for the oil and meal; none of these parts are factors in any of the AvoDerm� pet products formulations and we have no indication that avocado oil and meal as used in AvoDerm� are toxic, poisonous, harmful or bad for your dogs or cats diet.<br /><br />Dr. Art Craigmill, UC Davis, Professor and Extension Specialist in Environmental Toxicology has said that his studies and other research in the United States and Australia have shown that the problem of toxicity is in the leaves and the pit of the Guatemalan variety; the avocado meat of the fruit and oils have not been shown to be toxic. AvoDerm pet products do not utilize any Guatemalan variety avocados, nor do we use any leaves or pits of any variety of avocados for our avocado meal and oil.<br /><br />The avocado meal and oil used in the AvoDerm pet products comes from the meat of the fruit and does not contain leaves, bark, skin or pit of the fruit. The oil is extracted from ripened fruit in which the meat pulp has been separated from the skin and the pit. Through a mechanical separation process the oil is extracted and filtered and placed into sealed containers. The pulp of the fruit is dried, ground, and screened before being placed into its final packaging and than shipped to our facility."<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Do your own research, research the company or the claims about the ingredients or try it for yourself. My dog (Yorkshire Terrier) seems to love this food. He gets excited and waits by his bowl when he knows it is almost time to eat. He does this even for just the dry food alone! Other dry foods that I have tried before would require me to mix in some wet food after a while to make it more appealing. Not Avoderm - he is still always excited to eat it. He also gets a spoonful of the wet food in the afternoon as a snack and he goes even more bonkers for that stuff. I am happy with it - I will be trying the grooming products next.

review/summary: Excellent choice
review/text: By dogs, Gus (Glen Imaal Terrier Mix) and Tootsie (tiny teacup Poodle) both loved the food.  I will have to feed it to them for a few more months to see if it REALLY changes their energy level, etc.  I have noticed their bowel movements are smaller, which I understand is a good sign for dog food that is full of nutrients and not fillers.  Anyway, I loved it and am getting more.

review/summary: Chihuahaua does very well on this food
review/text: My chihuahua puppy did so well on this food, but then I could not find it anymore. I tried a new food, but she had diarrhea and bloody mucous. Finally I put her on the Avoderm Small Breed Adult food as the formulation is a lot like the small breed puppy version, except with a little less protein. My puppy is 8 months old now so I figured it was okay. Now she is thriving again -- nicely formed stool, very silky coat that is luxurious to touch, and lots and lots of cheerful energy. I am not kidding. I hate paying a premium price and having to go way out of my way to buy Avoderm, but my dog does so well on it that I am going to keep her on it. How much can a 3 pound dog eat, anyway.

review/summary: My Cavalier Loves This Stuff!
review/text: My small Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (81/2 months old & only 8 lbs.) loves this food!  Anything else, she turns her nose up at (she's picky, too!).  But she gobbles this up like crazy.  Its a great formula and the avocado meal and oil in it has given her a most beautiful and soft, silky coat (the grandkids say she feels like a bunny!).  She also has a bit of a sensitive stomach and vomits whenever she has any food with beef in it, or rawhides, bully sticks, etc.  With this formula, no disgestive problems at all.  My only complaint is that Avoderm only makes it in a 3.5 lb bag instead of larger, more economical sizes.  I've sent them an e-mail to ask about manufacturing larger bags.  Otherwise, this has been really great for my "baby".

review/summary: The only thing my picky dogs will eat!
review/text: I have had a really difficult time getting my dogs to eat dog food:  one had to be on a special homemade diet for 6 months, after which no kibble would make the grade.  Fortunately, this one worked, although I do take extra measures for my incredibly picky dogs, including crushing it, adding warm water, heating it in the microwave, and mixing it with ground beef.  Avoderm is a healthy food that I trust, and the other reviewer with concerns about avocados need not worry:  it's the stems and leaves of the avocado that are a problem for dogs, not the meat of the fruit itself.  I will keep buying as long as they make it.

review/summary: GREAT DOG FOOD
review/text: I have to buy this dog food for my Dashound because of allergies to food. This is the only dry dog food I have been able to find that will not cause him to break out with bumps. Beside he loves it. I will continue to buy this as long as I can find it.<br /><br />He has had no adverse reactions since being on the this food. It is better than the stuff the vet was selling me for allergy's.

review/summary: FINALLY, ANOTHER OPTION FOR SMALL OLDER DOGS WITH TEETH PROBLEMS
review/text: I have have 10 toy poodles and all are over 8 years old and have lost some teeth.  I have searched and searched for a very tiny kibble which, when water is added, will not take an hour to soften up for them.  All others I have tried are so hard  and larger than I like, except bil-jac.  I have been giving them bil-jac for years mixed with canned dog food.  Bil-jac is the only one I had found that the kibbles are small and easy to crumble for them even dry.  To add water to it, however, makes it more gooey.  I wanted to try something new for them but had just about given up.  I tried this brand of canned dog food and that was a hit so thought I'd give this dry a try.  Well, it works just great and they love it.  I use a  Cuisinart  k-cup type coffee maker that also is used in our household for hot water.  I just put the dog food in a bowl add the hot water and it is soft enough in less than 10 minutes.  It is not as gooey as bil jac when wet. The kibble is triangle shaped about 3/8 of an inch on all sides. VERY TINY, which is what I needed. I would recommend this food to anyone with small dogs, older dogs of any size who have gum and teeth problems and have  trouble chewing or are missing teeth and can't chew at all. I am so happy I discovered this food!  P.S.  It's a very healthy food for them too.  As long as the price is reasonable, like now, 15.00 for 7 lbs, and can be bought with Prime 2 day shipping free, I will continue to buy it on a regular basis.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/21/12 - Oh rats!  I went to re-order and price went up to 16.98 plus 5.73 for shipping.  Disappointed, but found another seller who offers prime shipping on this item, thank goodness. Regular USPS does not deliver directly to our house, in the mountains, and we have to go pick it up.  I am not always able to do that due to health restraints, so Prime shipping is very important to us as it offers UPS delivery to our door. This seller always did an amazing job getting our order to us quickly with the prime shipping and I was very happy with them. I regret having to change, but is necessary.

review/summary: Our senstive-digestive cavalier also likes this
review/text: We bought this based on the review written by the other cavalier owner.  We were having issues with our puppy vomiting and having diaharrea - we switched food a few times and finally concluded it was food allergy.  We combine Avoderm with chicken thigh meat and broth and our puppy eats it pretty well and hasn't vomited since we switched to Avoderm (about a month ago).

review/text: Avocado is known to be a poison for dogs..Why in this world would they put it in dog food?<br /> DON'T MAKE MISTAKES PEOPLE. things like garlic, yeast-wheats, and avocado are NOT good for your pets! Keep with meat, certain fruits(never dried), and grains that aren't processed. You can't feed your dog what people think is trendy.
