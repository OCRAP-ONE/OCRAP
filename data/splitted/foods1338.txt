review/summary: Here's To My Good Health!
review/text: I read somewhere that chocolate is now good for you. I don't remember where. It was just one of those things that stuck in my mind. I suppose it's because I've always liked chocolate, and especially really dark chocolate. Oh, you know, in that article, it also said that the darker the chocolate, the better it was for you. Go figure. Well, it used to be that chocolate was bad because it had a high fat content, but these days it seems that there's bad fat and good fat and chocolate has the good kind. Plus, this chocolate (70% Cacao content) is organic, not the ordinary kind. Modern nutrition is marvelous. Well, all of this came to mind as I strolled by the candy rack in a nearby Fresh and Easy Market where I was grocery shopping and this Green and Black's Dark Organic Chocolate Bar (3.5 ounces) was impossible to pass by. Did I mention that this bar is really tasty? Here's to my good health!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: I won't buy it again
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U5E3OM">Vernor's Ginger Ale Diet, 12 oz Can (Pack of 12)</a><br />The standard (non-dietetic) Vernor's is something special. Unfortunately, because it isn't available everywhere, I haven't had it for years. Anyway, if it's still the remarkable drink that it used to be, its dietetic version version should hang its head in shame. While it's not the worst soft drink I have ever had (Zevia Cola is) it's not something I would ever buy again. The difference between the two Vernor's is the effervescence. The standard has it to an extent unequalled by any other soft drink that I know of. In fact, it's lack of popularity may be because it's too strong for most people. However, if you like it, nothing else is as satisfying. The diet Vernor's, on the other hand, is completely unremarkable in that department. It tastes the same as the Standard, but it just doesn't have the punch that the standard drink does, and punch is what makes Vernor's Standard so remarkable.<br /><br />I'll have to keep looking. I  had settled on Coca-Cola Zero as being the best diet drink, but it seems to me that its taste has changed. I can't prove that, but it no longer satisfies.<br /><br />Oh, one more thing about Vernor's Diet drink. I ordered it on May the 23rd but it didn't arrive until June the 5th. That's too long to wait.

I grew it in really fertile soil and it was very well fertilized and watered.  Perhaps one of the cold fronts that came thru when it was six inches tall stunted it.

review/text: What I like best about this syrup is, it's not obnoxiously sweet. I can use it to flavor seltzer, or as an 'additive' to other drinks (like hot cocoa). When fruity syrups are too sweet, they have almost a slightly bitter taste to them. This doesn't. It's very smooth, but it's not weak either. You don't have to put a ton of syrup in to taste it.

review/summary: Processed in China
review/text: My vet saw that Wildside Salmon is freeze-dried and processed in China and recommended I stop feeding my cats the treat. I'm so sad to agree. One cat positively "lives" for the rattle of this package, and I was so happy to think I was feeding him a healthy treat that he loved. No more. Wildside, please consider processing in a country whose standards we can trust. I'll gladly come back as a customer when you do.<br /><br />Update: In fairness, Wildside Salmon is alert to concerns; I went onto their website where they address fears about processing in China. They say the reason they process in China is to be able to ship more economically worldwide, and mention standards that the plant is held to through inspections and other means. They also state that the single ingredient(salmon) does not COME from China. I admit, I don't know how to assess the standards they mention, either here or in the U.S. but to be as safe as possible, I'm still looking at alternative freeze-dried salmon treats.

review/text: We have 5 cats... and 4 of them will stop whatever they are doing, no matter where in the house they are, no matter at what stage in their naps they are, no matter if I served them Beluga Caviar for dinner 5 minutes ago... if I shake a bag of WildSide Salmon Treats, 4 of 5 come running. My female will cry if she sees the bag until we give in and give her some. And one you start, they will keep coming back for more until there is nothing but dust, but then they hoover up the dust, too. I don't know why the 5th cat is a hold-out, but 4 of 5 of my cats recommend this treat...and one of them is getting sent to rehab, just like a crack addict. It's actually pretty hysterical.

review/summary: What? sent from alaska to china? my cat will be heartbroken he has to give these up!
review/text: I found these pure alaskan salmon treats at the vet where my kitty was undergoing radiation for skin cancer of the nose ( he is white/ fair skinned. and all those years of laying in the hot california sun gave him skin cancer of the nose.)  I am originally from seattle,washington and have been to Alaska many times.  I was thrilled when i found these treats of pure 100% Alaskan freeze dried salmon for my cat.  I knew they would be a healthy treat that would help his ammune system instead of hurting it.  My cat LOVES them too! He goes crazy when i pull out the bag, and sits in front of the pantry letting me know "its treat time".  I am so dissapointed to learn that the salmon is now being flown from Alaska to China to be packaged!  My cat will be even more dissapointed!  Please, wildside salmon co., go back to packaging in Alaska!  Even if it is more expensive to buy it would be worth it!  The whole reason i bought them & tried them in the first place was because of the fact that they came fresh from Alaska- and are 100% pure and healthy salmon!  I dont trust products from china and unfortunately my cat will miss these horribly.  shannon<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008B9TOYA">WildSide Salmon - Wild Alaskan Freeze Dried Salmon Treats for Cats, 3 oz.

review/summary: why so expensive -- and what's with the texture?
review/text: I usually buy wheat berries in bulk but had no other choices yesterday and bought the only brand (Nature's Earthly Choice, packaged) carried in my local market. Not only is Nature's Earthly Choice about FIVE times as expensive as buying in bulk (even from the high-end national chain store), but Nature's Earthly Choice is also more expensive than virtually all other brands. And after cooking, Nature's Earthly Choice Wheat Berries looked awful - as if they'd been totally overcooked and every kernal had exploded. (Perhaps that's because they've been turned into a "cooks in 15 minutes" processed grain.) Cooking instructions on the package are almost non-existant -- no mention of medium or low flame, covered or uncovered, whether all the water was all supposed to be absorbed or what. The salad recipe on the package made it sound like there should've been no excess water, so after 20 minutes on an uncovered simmer I figured I was supposed to drain the berries. I know I'll end up feeling like I should apologize to fans (of my usual apple salad with wheat berries) about how it looks.  Very disappointing and a ripoff.

review/summary: 3-in-1 Bully-Wrapped Bone
review/text: The bully stick wrapped around the bone is probably a standard size, which, for people who don't know bully sticks as well as I wish I didn't, is less than 1 inch thick, but usually bigger than 1/2 inch.  My dog is a heavy chewer: she has not met a bully, a bone, a pen, a tissue, a piece of wood she doesn't like to chew.  I think that it takes her a little longer to get through this bully stick than a normal straight, 12" stick because it is more of a puzzle.  The bone adds a little bit of a challenge.<br /><br />She doesn't spend a lot of time chewing on the bone.  I think it must be frustrating because she can't get anywhere.  Instead of throwing it out, I stuff it with peanut butter and a little kibble and put it in the freezer.  I think of it as a "Bone Kong" even though that sounds gross.  Anyway, I give it to her as a treat and she loves to dig for the peanut butter.<br /><br />The bully bone is approx. 3.5" long and 1.5" wide at it's widest point.  My dog is a 50lb pittie mix and she chews on it without a danger of swallowing it.  If I had a bigger dog, I might steer clear of this treat.  For small and medium-sized dogs, this $3+ treat is worth it!

review/summary: how to keep two energetic pups entertained?
review/text: Goof balls are the best dog chews I have found to keep our two wild beasts entertained.  Dog chews seem to come in two types, the crumbly cookie type and the mega-chew that lasts for days and could also be used as a doorstop.  Goof balls are an excellent alternative.  They are lightweight, long lasting rawhide strip- webbing with a chicken nugget inside and they are also balls and can be used as toys too.  I just love them.  (Not me personally, but Hudson and Ruby love them).

review/summary: Terrible cookie and overpriced
review/text: Absolutely some of the worse cookies I've ever had, and I'm sort of a cookie monster.<br /><br />The texture was dry and brittle, crumbling into pieces.  Sealed in a tin with wax paper, they should have been soft and moist.  This indicates one of a poor recipe, poor ingredients, or left out far too long before packaging.<br /><br />Even with a poor texture, one could tolerate it with good flavor.  Unfortunately, the flavor was abysmal.<br /><br />With poor texture and poor flavor, these cookies are inedible.  I threw the entire tin in the garbage, and I almost never throw food away.<br /><br />Coupled with the high price and very high shipping charge, I just had to write a review, and this is my first one.  Best to skip this item and save your money and your stomach.

review/summary: Taste inconsistent. QC issue
review/text: In case anyone's confused, this is 96 oz total per order. You get two Double Pack boxes.<br /><br />As for the cereal, I think I got a bad batch (AUG2412 P23). A 14 oz box I got from the local grocery store with a OCT2011 best by date tasted way better--light crisp flakes mixed with thin crunchy ones with sweet clusters of oats that give it a granola-like taste and texture. The oats from this batch were much different: some seemed whole still, instead of rolled, making it harder, chewier, and nuttier; some were giant toasted brown clusters of oats, toasted stiff and hard. Not exactly bad, but the first bowl was quite a surprise, due to how the oats would be rolling around in my mouth, forcing me to chew much more. The whole oats were like bigger sunflower seed kernels, but thicker and harder.<br /><br />Update: Opened another box after finishing the other 14 oz boxes and definitely taste something funny in this. Oats weren't really hard this time, but they had a taste like some sort of chemical cleaner or pesticide in it. I wish I could return this. I sense it's a health hazard. I wonder if I could send this in to test somewhere. To top it all off, I found ants had infested a box. There doesn't seem to be any doubts that there's some quality control issue going on here. Maybe the chemical taste was some ant killer chemical and the production plant this originated from had some sort of ant infestation and they sent some tainted product out.

review/summary: Fantastic Smoked Sea Salt
review/text: I have several varieties of Artisan salts and this one is my favorite.  It is naturally smoked over hickory wood, which is the most desired wood for smoking food in the Midwest.  It is not produced by using liquid smoke like some other brands.  Upon opening the container the first time, I thought the smokiness was a little overwhelming, but when used, I found it to be perfect.  When you sprinkle it on your food at the table, you get an aroma similar to walking into one of Kansas City's famous BBQ restaurants.  The flavor is wonderful.  I use this as a gourmet table salt/finishing salt.  The other Artisan smoked salts are also wonderful, but as I said, this one is my favorite.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Quick flavor booster
review/text: This is my second order for the set of three containers.  This salt is such an easy way to add a little flavor to bland food like a simple soup or a plain dish of beans that I've come to count on it in the kitchen.  I also like it with olive oil on a bowl of grains or popcorn.  I ran out while thinking I still had another container and I almost panicked in the middle of making chili.<br /><br />It's true you could get a similar effect with liquid smoke and plain salt, but this is much, much better tasting and easier to add.  Just be careful because it is quite strong and salty.  Add this to a dish first using a light touch, taste, then add more salt if needed.  It took a little experience to not add too much by accident.<br /><br />The flavor is natural and delicious.  It's become one of my secret ingredients for fixing a dish that needs a little flavor boost.  I'll be glad to have it back in my cupboard.<br /><br />UPDATE  I'm ordering this again.  When I got my last order, I noticed that they have reconfigured the salt to be larger grain, almost like sea salt.  I like the change because it's easier to control the amount you add.<br /><br />Also, this does have a strong odor when opened and my daughter, who has a very strong sense of smell, can't stand being near it.  However, once I get it mixed into the food, she likes the taste.  If you have a strong sense of smell, this may be hard for you to use.

It is real good to use as a rub on steaks even if you are grilling them. If you use to much hickory smoked sea salt, it can over power the taste so I go light and use a little regular salt as well. I still use black pepper with it.

review/summary: This rub is for Everything!
review/text: Someone had given me a bottle of the Plowboys BBQ Yardbird Rub. I was curious about the statement on the bottle "Created for Chicken but Made for Pork" I thought what are they talking about? First of all I never use a jar of rub, make my own! But I thought I'd give it a try, first on Chicken pretty good, but on pork, this is a ROCK STAR!!! Done it on shoulders, but the real deal was when I smoked a whole pork loin on my gas grill using a smoke box and indirect heat.(Yes can you beleive it a gas grill!). After brineing the pork for a day in just salt, sugar and some spices. I just sprinkled the rub all over and put it on for an hour and half at 325. Pork loin has never tasted sooooo gooood!!!!!!!<br /><br />Also did it on some baby back's as a dry rub, smoked them for four hours then painted them up with some Montgomery Inn BBQ Sauce, this was a perfect combination.<br /><br />Nice size jar, 14oz, just have to get more from Amazon since I live in Virginia not Kansas City. Been smoken and BBQ meat for years this is the first time I have ever liked a rub out of a jar! A must try for anyone who likes smoke pork and chicken!Yes the bottle is just as advertised!

If I want hotter for myself, just a dusting of Cyan with the rub does the trick for my serving.<br /><br />Lip smacking ribs, anything pork and chicken.

I would often have them after a meal as a palate cleanser or in place of gum during the day. When we moved to VA, I could not find them ANYWHERE.<br /><br />All of a sudden they showed up on Amazon for a great place and I have my JOLS again!! The forest berry was the only kind I had ever had before however now I am a huge fan of the orange as well. If you are a pastille fan or like "Ricola Pearls" you will be a big fan of Jols!<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for bringing back my must have candy as they are incredibly hard to find and expensive everywhere else!

Only problem is they can cause stomach problems (if you know what I mean) if you eat more than one a day. There is a warning to this effect on the box. Too bad, as I could eat them all day.<br />The berry flavored Jols are very good. The orange flavored Jols are ok, but kind of odd tasting...but I like them anyway. Bottom Line: Inexpensive candy that lasts a long time in the mouth...just don't eat too many in one day.

review/text: I really HAVE to stop browsing the cat food aisles and coming home with this stuff, but quite frankly, the guy just loves it!  This is NOT a pate, but contains very small bits so those of you who have cats with smaller mouths, this is a great find.  I have all three varieties - turkey, beef and chicken, and my cat just loves each one of them.  I've been pawed on the leg for more when the bowl is empty and so, well, that's enough for me!  Great stuff, very pricey here, however, so check your local store first.  Should be around sixty cents a can in the midwest.  Hey, something new that they actually let us poor schmucks here in Ohio actually have!  Yeah!  Great product, highly recommend!

review/summary: Great Coffee, Unlike Starbucks
review/text: I agree 100% with "nuttinbutdtruth"--this coffee is great and, thankfully, does not have the Starbucks "burnt" flavor which comes from roasting the beans to a higher internal bean temperature (i.e., burning them).  The Eight O' Clock 100% Colombian coffee is smooth with a real coffee flavor.  I have also bought Eight O' Clock Original coffee, and it tastes similar to the Colombian--both are great tasting and apparently are American Roast ("American Roast is a light to medium roast...This roast results in a full bodied, acidic cup of coffee.").<br /><br />Starbucks coffee, on the other hand, tastes to me like French Roast ("French roast is similar to Espresso roast only a little bit darker. This roasting style produces a full bodied coffee that has low acidity and a dominating bittersweet flavor.") or maybe Italian Roast ("Italian roasted coffee beans are nearly completely black in color. This roasting style produces a coffee that is very weak bodied with strong burnt flavors and low acidity.").  Each to their own, but according to many coffee experts, "...acidity is a good thing when it comes to coffee", and as stated on one coffee website: "In actuality the medium roast better preserves the true coffee bean as the darker roasts burn off some of the natural coffee oils and cause it to have a harsher taste. The medium roasts allow you to better savoir the way the coffee bean was intended to taste."  Also, according to the same website: "A darker roast can actually make a lower quality coffee bean taste better. The bean no longer relies on the flavors from its origin and leans more on the burnt flavor that results from the darker roasting process."<br /><br />According to another coffee website: "Maximum aroma and flavor, is generally found at the lighter end of the dark range. At the darkest end of the dark range, coffee has lost all of its acidity and has a distinctly burnt flavor."  And according to Wikipedia: "At lighter roasts, the bean will exhibit more of its 'origin flavor'; the flavors created in the bean by the soil and weather conditions in the location where it was grown. Coffee beans from famous regions like Java, Kenya, Hawaiian Kona, and Jamaican Blue Mountain are usually roasted lightly so their signature characteristics dominate the flavor. As the beans darken to a deep brown, the origin flavors of the bean are eclipsed by the flavors created by the roasting process itself. At darker roasts, the 'roast flavor' is so dominant that it can be difficult to distinguish the origin of the beans used in the roast."<br /><br />As a fan of American Roast coffee with a truer coffee bean flavor, I think this Eight O' Clock 100% Colombian coffee is extremely hard to beat.  It is also reasonably priced.

review/summary: Absolutely Fabulous, but Starbucks fans look elsewhere
review/text: This is without a doubt one of the best coffee's out there. One poor review is from an admitted Starbuck fan who wants to taste the roast. I want to taste the coffee. It is a matter of preference and expectations.<br /><br />The sad state of coffee is the Starbucks syndrome of dark roasting. Yes, the dark roasting lends a flavor in addition to the coffee that, according to the popularity of Starbucks, appeals to many.<br /><br />I have seen many coffee boutiques offer fabulous medium roast coffee only to cave in to the demands of the Starbucks crowds and burn, uh, roast my favorites darker than I prefer.<br /><br />Not so with this Eight O'Clock delight. If you want more coffee than "roast" flavor, this is the drink for you! It takes a VERY high quality bean to stand up to a medium roast without tasting like wood or paper.<br /><br />If you want coffee that taste as good as it smells, and are not looking for the Starbucks burnt offerings, look no further.

review/text: I heard about Eight O' Clock's Colombian ground coffee on a Consumer Reports radio segment, and I knew I had to try this. I'm the guy who buys the coffee for our office and I'm always on the lookout for something new for the staff to try, and this one was a BIG hit. Flavorful with a smooth richness one would expect from a more expensive brand but, without the price tag, and the burnt aftertaste of some of the other coffees to include Starbucks, this is one that made the office shortlist in well short order!

review/text: This coffee is a solid choice for an office or break room where you probably don't have a grinder. It's not going to "wow" you with a deep, complex character, but it's not going to leave you with a nasty aftertaste either. It's a nice, mild taste that is surprisingly good (to me) when cold as well.<br /><br />You're probably going to want to transfer some amount to a smaller container and take it out of there when you make a cup, refilling from the bag when that container is empty. That will keep it a bit fresher.

review/summary: Pretty great coffee!
review/text: Let me preface this review with a warning: I'm a coffee heretic.  That's right, I drink my coffee with milk and sugar.  Always have, always will.  I'm not interested in drinking straight black coffee and grimacing my way through a cup because I don't enjoy that overwhelming bitter taste the majority of packaged coffee has, so this review will be oriented toward the other coffee heretics out there.<br /><br />I don't drink drip coffee very often.  When I'm at home, the coffee maker is reserved for making iced tea - if I try to bring coffee within five feet of it, there's a freakout and I'm forced to clean it directly afterward with several cycles of vinegar.  When I'm at school, I don't generally have time in the morning and just grab a coffee on my way to class or use the crystallized coffee mix which comes in boxes.  I also don't have much money to spend on coffee.  When I do get to make a pot of drip coffee, it's usually on the weekend when I'm working on papers, and it's a joyous time indeed.<br /><br />Eight O'Clock coffee has a reasonable price at most supermarkets and on Amazon, putting it within my budget.  When I make a pot, it's always very dark and rich and has a smell which fills the apartment in a wonderful way.  I was surprised at how different it was from the crystallized stick coffee I'm used to.  For one, a little milk doesn't overwhelm it.  I actually needed more milk than usual to even the taste out while leaving just a bite of bitterness, and it actually melded beautifully, becoming slightly mellow and even richer.  The milk didn't hurt it but was a nice compliment.  A few spoonfuls of sugar added just the right bit of sweetness.<br /><br />This is a slow drinking coffee for me.  I like to linger with it while writing.  Unlike most coffee I drink just for a shot of energy, this is enjoyable.  It's smooth, not burnt, and just tastes plain good.  With the price point and the taste, buying a bag or three should be a no brainer.

review/summary: Eight O'Clock Colombian Coffee
review/text: We love Eight O'Clock Colombian coffee and buy both the whole bean and ground coffee in 33-ounce bags through Amazon Subscirbe and Save each month. It's hard to find in local stores, plus it's much cheaper with Subscribe and Save. Since we're avid daily coffee drinkers, buying the better brand at lower prices is a real plus.

review/summary: Pretty Good Colombian
review/text: This is the first time I have tried the Eight O'Clock brand and I was pleasantly surprised. I've tried several other Colombians (Coffee Bean, Starbucks, Nabob, and a couple others). I think this is my new favorite. It has that typical citrusy nuance of a good Colombian without the actual roasting smothering the flavor. I'll order another as soon as my current coffee inventory is depleted. I am currently drinking the Eight O'Clock  Original roast which is also good.
