review/summary: Greens Superfood
review/text: In the past I had been using Barleans Greens but was looking to replace that product with a similar, less expensive green superfood powdered mix.  I am very pleased with Greens Superfood!  I use this powder twice daily in my smoothie/protein drinks...it claims to boost your energy levels and I agree.  I exercise intensely, daily and feel that the Greens helps me maintain my energy levels needed for my workouts and for the remainder of my day.  I love the taste and my kids think I am drinking Hulk food!

review/text: I have switched to another brand of greens that doesn't seem to be as rich in fiber as this one, but has a better flavor.  It depends on your taste, but both brands of greens provide about the same nutrition.

review/summary: Love this! So glad I ordered it!
review/text: I've been going through knee surgeries (9 total) over the past 5 years.  I wanted some sort of drink that I could incorporate into my daily routine to help my immune system and overall health.  I was weary of the taste, but I liked all the positive reviews & figured why not.  Now let me me tell you how I drink it- I bought a blender bottle (the kind w/ the mesh metal ball inside to help mix) fill it up with 12 ounces of apple juice, a scoop of the powder, ice, and shake shake shake. I love it!<br />Will continue to order. :) :) :)

review/summary: It Simply Works - No Gimmicks
review/text: I'm sure I am no different than the rest of you who have tried countless products to be somewhat disappointed or it takes months to see the difference if any, but this product really works.  I've had digestive problems and have taken everything to keep a continuous flow (if you know what I mean), but this product immediately made a difference in my life.<br /><br />I had to work on the recipe because it is a bit grassy tasting, but I found if I mix my flax oil with the green superfood first to moisten it, then add to my milk, yogurt and banana, it doesn't taste grassy at all and very good.  This is surely a keeper.  So excited to finally find something that is worthy and effective.

review/text: I'm giving it 5 stars because it doesn't taste bad.  I don't have to "mix" it with anything to kill the taste.  I don't have to put it in juice or make a smoothie.  It's very palatable, IMHO.<br />I put a double scoop in water and drink.  It's a little "gritty", but so what. If it's good for you, what the hay!!?<br />I haven't taken it long enough to notice any significant benefits, but based on the other reviews, I should be fine.<br />I'm getting my "greens", and that's good enough for me.

review/text: Excellent product.  I mix it with apple juice for a great morning pick me up and when I dont have time to eat a complete breakfast.  Great way to get off the coffee habit.  I noticed an additional energy boost from my first use.  Taste is good and no problem with excess sediment because I use a shaker type cup with lid.  When drink is done I put a little water in the cup to get every golden bit. I noticed the enzymes have helped with a little digestive issue I have.  Easy way to keep balanced fruit and vegetable nutrition in my diet.

review/text: I bought it because of the reviews here but when I mixed it with my Nutiva cacao powder, I almost threw up. Pretty nasty, I could taste the "greens" underneath the cacao. I was too scared to add my hemp powder to it.<br /><br /> By itself, however, it was OK, it reminded me of watered-down juice.<br /><br />I still want to use it though because of the health benefits but is there anyway to disguise the taste? I travel a lot and I can't bring a blender with me. I am trying to see if I can add hemp protein and amazing grass green superfood together without gagging. Any advice? (tons of stevia??)

review/summary: Don't buy it for taste....
review/text: I don't think that any of these powders are really going to be able to be delicious AND do what they say they are going to do at the same time. I read the other reviews and there were a lot that stated this tasted great. I disagree, BUT I will say that this is a very good powder, and after using for only a week, I felt a difference in my digestive system and overall well being. So for me it does what I bought it for and more! I personally have a weird palate, so the taste wasn't that off to me. It was by no means delicious, and I do have to hold my nose, but I can swallow it without gagging. There is a grittiness to it, but I use one of those "Blender Bottles" and just shake it around a little to keep it from settling. This helps alot. By the way, I've gotten used to the taste after taking this for over a week, it still stinks though... :)

review/summary: Good stuff but the taste kills it...
review/text: I buy and use "Wheat Grass Powder" from Amazing Grass. That product is superior, but this one leaves a lot to be desired. I happen to like the green vegetable juice taste many people do not like, so when I purchased this product I thought it would have the same green taste that goes very well in some diluted apple juice. I was wrong. Though it has excellent green ingredients, all of them organic, the taste is weird because they have included peppermint. The peppermint really takes away from the aromatic flavor of the grasses and introduces a minty aftertaste, kind of like brushing your teeth with a minty toothpaste and then drinking juice right after. Not too tasty. This product would be great if the peppermint was omitted. Buy their "Amazing Grass Organic Wheat Grass Powder, 30 Servings, 8.5-Ounce Container" and write to the company and tell them to get rid of the peppermint.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: I got roped into drinking this over a year ago, when an order from iHerb had a sample packet.  I really liked the taste and the energy I got from drinking it.  So I purchased a canister (it's a LOT! of powder) and am still working on it.<br /><br />The taste is naturally sweet with a vegetably taste, but it's not bitter.  I don't like sweets much so it's right up my alley taste-wise.<br /><br />I usually drink less than a scoop at a time because I get a "high" from drinking it, which I don't like very much.  It's also a lot of vitamin A, and it's not healthy to intake huge excesses since it's a fat-soluble vitamin.  I also find that if I drink a whole scoop every day, then stop, I will get a headache and a weird loopy feeling of withdrawal.  Supplements are drugs - keep that in mind.<br /><br />And, of course, you shouldn't be substituting this for a healthy diet.  I use it as a periodic supplement to augment the days I don't eat enough leafy greens.<br /><br />Overall, the sedimentation left at the bottom of the glass isn't a big deal.  Add another 1/2 cup of water, swish, and drink the remains!

review/summary: Pleasant Surprise!
review/text: I'll start by saying I'm not a fan of green powder drinks - I've tried a couple of others and finally resorted to pill form.  However, trying to take the amount of pills needed to equal one scoop of greens was a bit much.  I finally quit the pills and resorted to thinking that there were no greens in my future.  Then I stumbled on this product and read the reviews and still wanting to "do" greens I decided to brave it.  I agree with the other posts here, this is some amazing stuff!  I haven't tried it plain yet, but I have mixed it in with some carrot juice/water, with my metamucil, with some veggie juice and in a fruit smoothie.  Every one of those tasted perfectly fine and I didn't get that just mowed lawn taste!  I will say that the mixing is not the easiest although I've learned to use a fork and start with a small amount of water adding a bit more and stirring etc.  I've not found any residue in the bottom of the glass and I drank it so fast it didn't have time to settle.  I've only been using this for six days but I do think my energy level is better than before.  Overall I think this is a major improvement on the "green" concept and I plan to continue using it.  I haven't tried the other flavors either but I figured if this one tastes ok the others are probably equally as good.  If you've been scared away by the taste of some other greens you may want to consider trying this one.

Almond milk, spinach, frozen blueberries, a couple left-over slices of banana and pear, and some celery. And a hearty scoup of Amazing Grass and a touch of agave nectar!<br /><br />I highly recommend Amazing Grass!!

review/text: Ferrara Pan Candy Company was founded in 1900, in Chicago, Illinois. In 1962, the company hit on a new great tasting candy - Lemonheads. Tart and sweet at the same time, it was a huge success, and a staple of the company. Later, the company spread out, making several other flavors of the candy, including Cherryheads, Appleheads and Grapeheads.<br /><br />Lemonheads are delicious, little yellow candies that are sweet and tart, and have that great lemon taste. Admittedly they are not as sour as the newer super-sour candies, but too many of those other candies just give you a wave of tasteless super-sour, and then you get to eat the super-sweet candy. With Lemonheads, you get a nice flavor of tart lemons, especially if you chew on them (which I recommend :-).<br /><br />When I was growing up in the Chicagoland area, Ferrara Pan candies were a staple of every kids diet. Now, eating Lemonheads takes me back to my childhood. Buy Lemonheads and enjoy a great candy. I highly recommend them!

There are two things preventing me from giving five stars. One is the vase is brown and not dark blue as described in the title. No big deal for me. The second is that unless stones, marbles or soil is added to the vase the plant won't stand up straight on its own. Again, not a big deal but just know that this plant does not come completely ready to display.

review/summary: wonderful
review/text: This vinegar is wonderful.  It's a huge bottle and the taste is beyond compare.  When Sherry vinegar is called for in a recipe, there is no alternative for its sweet, pungy flavor.  However, I use this vinegar for salad dressings and in place of red wine vinegar.  I purchased it only a few weeks ago and it is half gone.  I will be ordering again.

review/summary: Fresh, crispy and the perfect sweet / salty snack delivered straight to your door
review/text: I love Chicago style popcorn (that perfect balance of cheese and caramel) and go to great lengths to get "the good stuff".  It is hard to get the perfect Chicago style but I am so pleased to have found KuKuRuZa and love the fact that Amazon will drop it off right at my doorstep!<br /><br />Finding a high quality Chicago style corn has always been a bit of a challenge.  The holiday season always brings the obligatory bucket of three flavors but the popcorn is not fresh and doesn't make my taste buds dance..  Occasionally I order from the other website (starts with a G) but it is so expensive it is hard to justify more than once a year.  Even less often I will trek out of my way to the mall and get a bag mixed up but it is a pain to fight the crowds.<br /><br />This popcorn was amazing!  The cheese was nice and cheesy and the caramel was light and crispy.  There was a 50/50 ratio which is typical but I like my popcorn a little saltier and tend to like 2 parts cheese to 1 part caramel but the kid and the husband picked up the slack and helped to finish the caramel that I left behind.  I will definitely order this popcorn again!  Perhaps next time I will add in an extra bag of cheddar and create my own mix.

review/text: I have to disagree with other reviewers who said that the banana chips in this are the same as any other.  Normal banana chips are like eating rocks and are really tasteless.  These however, are little intense bites of banana which are soft enough for a toddler.  My son, who is incredibly picky and won't touch most fruits and vegetables, loves these and specifically asks for the strawberries (though he won't eat fresh ones).  As to the cost, while you certainly can buy these at Whole Foods and other similar places the packages they sell there are far smaller and are more expensive per ounce.  Actually, the Amazon price is even a little cheaper than buying direct from the manufacturer.

review/summary: Wonderful, yummy product, worth every penny!
review/text: Before I ordered these I had to call the company (got their # from their website) to see if these were freeze dried or just dried/dehydrated. Their listing should specify this, though it doesn't specify on they website either.<br />They are indeed freeze dried, delicious and crispy.<br /><br />My only complaint (reason for 4 stars) is that after shipment they get a little beat up and a lot of the pieces break. Really only the strawberries though, but the container was filled with red strawberry powder.<br />It's kind of disappointing to lose that little bit considering the price.<br />The smaller pieces are OK because I bought these for my two boys 2 and under.<br /><br />It's a far better deal and product compared to the Gerber Little Fruits I was buying and paying nearly $3 and ounce for. What I know now to be tasteless freeze dried fruit.<br /><br />Bottom line: I will buy these again.

review/text: Beyond the glaring fact that most of their products aren't tomatoes, this one is a blight on the Just Tomatoes ethos.<br /><br />"Just." But it has two ingredients. It's not "just" anything if it includes both bananas & strawberries. They don't call Cracker Jack "Just Peanuts, Popcorn, and High Fructose Corn Syrup."<br /><br />Nor is it "just" something when it comes in a package of 2. They don't call a variety pack of cereal "Just Grains and High Fructose Corn Syrup."<br /><br />The Just Tomatoes folks deserve credit for their aspirations to purity but this just goes beyond it. It goes against the mimalist and reductive concept to the absolutely roccoco. It's just not right!

review/summary: One of the Best Knudsen Spritzers
review/text: I've never been fond of sodas with just corn syrup and artificial flavors.  While, the R.W. Knudsen Spritzers aren't that much healthier, they do taste incredibly delicious.  I've tried many other similar products like izze's sparkling juices, but they can't compete.<br /><br />Most of the R.W. Knudsen spritzers use apple juice or white grape juice along with sparkling water as the main ingredients.  Still the strawberry does have strawberry (and pineapple) juice in it, and the flavor is undeniably strawberry-esque.  They are pretty sweet, but not sickeningly sweet.  Most sodas are probably a little sweeter than these spritzers.<br /><br />I would recommend this strawberry spritzer as my favorite flavor.  I also really like their peach spritzer.  The only one I've disliked has been the Lemon and Lime.

review/text: I am currently studying nutritional science and holistic nutrition.  I read about the health benefits of Salba and  decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad that I did because it really is delicious and now it has become a part of my daily diet.  To me the flavor is somewhere between ground flax and wheat germ.  I sprinkle it in my yogurt, in my oatmeal or cold cereal, but the possibilities are endless.  You can go to the Salba website and they have tons of recipe ideas incorporating this product.  It is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, fiber and antioxidants and all you need is a tablespoon or two a day (low in calories too).  It's a great product to add to a healthy diet, especially if you are having a hard time trying to find a source of omega-3 that you like!

review/text: My first order, about six weeks ago, arrived with a defective protective seal under the lid. I contacted Amazon and received a refund. I decided to try again a few days ago and it arrived with the same defect - Seems like the glue holding the seal to the bottle is not strong enough. I live in the desert and these things spend the day either in a mail truck or my outdoor mailbox. It's about 112 degrees in the shade, so probably much hotter in the metal mailbox. Perhaps the problem is heat related, but I get medicine and other supplements through the mail and none have ever had a defective seal. It seems to me that the manufacturer of this product has a defect on their hands.

I would have to be very uncomfortable for as long as five days until I found SALBA GROUND.Salba for me is nothing short of a miracle. The most important thing to remember is trink at least 10 - 12 8oz. glasses of water, which pushes the SALBA SEED through your system. If you don't drink the water you will have the reverse affect. The interesting source of this wonderful product is one of the DIABETIC magizines that I subscribe to and the article about SALBA was a reprint of a 2007 article in the same magazine, which was never done before or supported by the NATIONAL DIABETES FOUNDATION. But they now support the use of SALBA for a variety of aliments. The best source for all the SALBA products is AMAZON. AMAZON is better than all the SALBA web - sites. They, AMAZON carry a full line of all the SALBA products. I have tried different varaiations of SALBA, but the SALBA GROUND SEED is my " FRIEND IN NEED".

This cocoa is excellent and in my opinion, the best "diet" cocoa out there.  Other sugar free products just don't compare.  If you add a dollup of whipped cream, you don't even realize that you are drinking splenda (I think).<br /><br />I found this product at Sam's and went through 2 big boxes in one Fall and Winter season.  I shared this product with my weight watcher friends and they were delighted since it's taste is superior to other cocoas.  Currently, Sam's has removed it from the shelves. Hopefully they will restock it next Fall, but if they don't, I wanted to see if it was available online.  I'm very glad to see Amazon is selling it too.

review/summary: ingredients not the same as listed
review/text: I normally buy the organic version, but since they were out of stock, I ordered these.  They taste as good as they normally do, but the ingredients are not the same as listed.  They are: wholegrain oats, sunflower oil, palm oil, sea salt, sodium bicarbonate: raising agent, natural flavouring.  I normally avoid anything that says natural flavoring and wouldn't have bought these it that were listed on the page.

review/summary: Really, really good
review/text: Just got these for the first time, and hope they stay on subscribe & save. They are great just by themselves, am still experimenting to see what toppings I prefer on them compared with rice crackers. I don't particularly like regular porridge-type oatmeal, but love the taste of oats - so these are perfect for me. I used to make oat crackers myself (just whizzing up oat flour in the blender from rolled oats or buying it, adding enough water and optional oil/salt to work it, flattened and baked) but these are much better than anything I made. The texture is a little crumbly when you eat them but they still stay together as a cracker and it isn't hard to spread things on them (such as nut or seed butters, peanut butter, etc.).<br /><br />They come in 4 individual packets within the box (7 crackers in each), which can be helpful in keeping them fresh and also transporting them for a handy snack. I just put the remainder of a packet in a small container. They're quite filling - 91 calories, 2.3 g fiber, 2.3 g protein for 2 crackers. They're also big. about 2.5 inches in diameter.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: In my opinion, there are no better oatcakes on the market than these. Deliciously oaty and crunchy, they have no extraneous ingredients. Unlike so many others, they're not too salty (but just salty enough). They hold up well to being topped with cheese, spread with butter, or festooned with jam, and complement either sweet or salty toppings. We have a standing subscription for these and wouldn't be without them (if you buy them at your local market, check the subscription price against what you pay and I believe you'll see a serious saving). We, however, subscribe for the convenience of delivery to the door and the certainty of never running out of these crunchy, wonderful treats.

review/summary: A Must-Have That's Hard to Find
review/text: I have had the worst time finding oatcakes over the years.  I would occasionally find some but they were almost always the sweetened kind - which are also good, but not what I wanted.<br /><br />I can see that some people might be puzzled over the adoration some of us have for oatcakes.  Basically, they are simple crackers made of oats.  You might best describe them as rustic.  Which is the charm.<br /><br />If you've never had them, I would say the closest common product to compare them to might be graham crackers.  However, oatcakes are denser, less sweet, less soft, and less crumbly.  They are slightly more chewy, and possess more texture.  Imagine taking steel-cut oats and rolling them out into very thin, flat crackers.  So, these are slightly less brittle than regular crackers, resulting in less flaking, breaking or crumbling.  They are sturdy, holding up to toppings and handling.<br /><br />In these boxes, the crackers are cellophane wrapped in sets of 7, which is nice since it keeps them from going stale.  Because oats are high in fiber, these are more filling than you might think, and each oatcake is a nice, largish size-maybe a little bigger than a regular saltine cracker (and round, of course).  So you will probably get a goodly number of servings per box.<br /><br />These go well with all sorts of toppings, and are great plain too if you just need something with your coffee or tea etc. to deal with a stomach pang but don't really feel like anything fancy.  I think a lot of people would like this for breakfast for that reason.  I often get up in the morning and don't want to eat a meal, but just want a little something simple and plain.  These are a healthy good choice for that.<br /><br />I haven't tried using them for other things, like cracker crumb coatings, but I can't see any reason why you couldn't experiment with using these for things like that which you would use regular crackers for.  I think they would make a really nice rustic crumb pie crust or cobbler topping for either sweet or savory pies, for example.

[because they're baked in Scotland..how cool is THAT?]<br /><br />Amazon has a great price, and they are so fresh! If you haven't tried these, especially if you are a type 2 diabetic [oats are way better for us than wheat, and these crackers have no sugar added] I highly recommend ordering a batch..<br /><br />And go for the cheaper 'subscription' price. Heck, you only have to get two shipments per year to do so, and I'll bet after you try your first box, you'll find you'll be wanting to eat a lot more than that!

review/summary: Happy to find them.
review/text: I have allergies. Most gluten free crackers have a lot of problem ingredients. Nairn's Oats Cakes are basically oats, oil, salt and baking soda.They are a great wheat free substitute for crackers when I want a crunchy carb. I found them when traveling in England. One day I was standing in the gluten free aisle of Whole Foods and heard a  couple talking with a  British accent. I asked them if they knew where I could find Nairn's Oat Cakes. They said no and that they certainly missed them. I was so excited to find them on Amazon.  I like the Red Box "rough" the best. The Yellow Box "fine" has a baking soda taste to me. I don't let myself buy the sweetened ones because not eating the whole box requires more will power than I have. Thank you. Becky, Colorado

review/summary: My favorite black tea
review/text: Just a few years ago lychee black tea was almost impossible to find.  Now there are several products on Amazon and other sources on the web.<br /><br />Lychee black is my favorite tea.  As the description says it's a quality black tea with a hint of lychee sweetness.<br /><br />I usually purchase my lychee tea in bulk, it arrives in a (resealable) bag and I pour it into a couple of different cannisters (one at home, one at work, one for my "travel kit").  I ordered this tea because Amazon offers it under their "eligible for free shipping" program, I can get the same amount of tea in nice cannisters (always good for sharing with friends) for the same cost I pay for bulk PLUS shipping to another vendor.<br /><br />I hadn't tried the Tao of Tea brand for the black lychee before, and was interested in doing a taste test with my usual brand . . . it seemed a little more flavorful and fresher.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The cannisters are the double closed style (a second lid under the slide lid).

review/text: The Tao of Tea Lychee Black Tea blends a fairly mellow, good-quality black tea with the taste of the syrup you find in a can of lychees.  It's not objectionable to drink, but it's not something I think of as a treat or luxury either.  If you're looking for a high quality lychee black tea, I would recommend Lupicia's version which mixes a high-quality, complex yet balanced Keemun black tea with a more authentic lychee aroma.  Of course, it's twice as a expensive, but in this case, you get what you pay for.

review/text: These capers are about the size of a pea (they are not the super tiny nonpareille capers which my husband prefers). These are very salty and briny so I rinse them before using them in a recipe (or just to pop in my mouth for a healthy snack). I like to chop these up and add them to everything from tuna sandwiches, Thai spring rolls, potato/macaroni/antipasto/garden salads to Asian stir fries, quiche, omelette's, deviled eggs and other egg dishes, braised/saut&eacute;ed/roasted meats and just about any Italian and French cuisine. They definitely add a special 'extra' something to many dishes and they are quite versatile for hot or cold dishes. You could use them in limitless recipes. Just be sure to withhold some salt when you use them.<br /><br />On a side note: Capers are highest in Quercetin which is a potent flavonoid, very anti-inflammatory and also a natural antihistamine (these help my summer allergies immensely to my pleasant surprise).<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm going to be eating a lot of capers this summer and these are a great price!<br /><br />To taste-buds AND your health!

I do not know if Torani packs these individual bottles and ships them to Amazon and there was a problem with Torani's labeling or if Amazon packs these and labels them and someone in the warehouse isn't paying attention but the result is the same, nasty syrup.

review/text: First off, I like that it comes in a pack of 4 and it is cheaper than in store.<br /><br />It also is called for in a lot of my gluten free recipes, so I use it a lot to make various gluten free goodies.<br /><br />But, the best part of potato starch is using it as a thickener in gravy, soups, etc. When I first had to go wheat free I wasn't sure how I would get my gravies to thicken.  I started using cornstarch but found that it didn't reheat well at all and would get all clumpy.  One day I decided to use potato starch instead - holy cow it's amazing a thickener.  It reheats perfectly and doesn't get those odd clumps in.  Even if I could suddenly eat wheat again, I would still use potato starch as my thickener!
