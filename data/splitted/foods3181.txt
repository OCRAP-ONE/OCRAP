review/summary: vanilla disguise
review/text: Hidden behind the creamy vanilla flavor is a healthy organic list of veggies and fruit.  The protein curbs the urge to gag down junk food at work.  Often there is no time for lunch so I enjoy my Orgain and feel good about fueling my body well.  I have even used this one as a base for smoothies and it works great.  My favorite is the creamy fudge, but the sweet vanilla bean is delicious when I don't want chocolate.  Thanks for getting it home for free!

review/summary: Delicious alternative to liquid meals
review/text: I'm an on-the go person, who has never liked breakfast.  Years ago I used Slim-Fast to lose some weight, and developed the habit of a liquid breakfast.  Actually continued Slim fast (or sometimes Ensure) for breakfast for years.  But honestly, recently when I began to think those product really don't fit with my nutrition plan, which is about 99% organic.  I went looking for a better alternative and found this.  Oh my goodness, compared to slimfast, just tastes so much more 'real".  Still fills you up, but also seems to have a better vitamin profile.  This is my breakfast every day!

review/summary: Orgain Chocolate Fudge
review/text: I really like the taste of this drink over any other drink I have had like this since it does not have the synthetic taste of muscle milk or other post workout drinks. The fact that its organic makes it a healthier choice and so far I have no complaints about it. Only downside is the price but thats to be expected I suppose.

review/summary: Great product, highly reccomended!
review/text: I have been drinking Orgain pretty much since it was released on the market a couple of years ago and have really enjoyed it. Its a great alternative to all the other nutritional/protein shakes out there since it is all organic. About 4 months ago I started to have one every morning for breakfast since I am always in a rush in the morning. Since then, I have lost over 25 pounds! It is a great way to jump start my metabolism in the morning and has what seem to be the perfect ratio of fat/carbs/protein along with all the vitamins and minerals. Before I started drinking it for breakfast I would be super hungry by lunch time, but now, it holds me over really well and I can be more reasonable with my lunch portions. Overall, great product, highly recommended!

review/summary: Outstanding Snack!
review/text: My wife and I recently picked up a 30-ounce bag of Kirkland Signature Wholesome Fruit & Nuts at our local warehouse store. We use things like this as a relatively healthy snack, in contrast to the more common salty or sugar-laden snacks. I also add small baggies of the mixture with my lunch which I carry to work so as to avoid the food court offerings. This stuff is excellent! The nuts include almonds, walnuts and pistachios and they mix surprisingly well together. The dried fruits look a lot like raisons, but they are dried cranberries and cherries. The tastes are excellent in themselves and blend very well with the nut mixture. The total effect is one of the best fruit/nut mixtures I can ever remember having. The mixture had a very fresh taste, I might add. They're good enough that I tend to overindulge, so we have to be careful. Outstanding!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Yum Deliciousness!
review/text: I tried this mix while visiting relatives in Pheonix. I loved the stuff so much that I stopped by Costco on the way to the airport and bought 2 boxes of the individual serving bags. My family devoured the bags back at home so quickly that I hid the second box - you see, my intent was to carry the bags in my car, purse, etc  so I'd have some protein & carbs when my blood sugar was low. I was glad to have found both the large 30oz bag and individual bags here on Amazon as we don't have a Costco in Oklahoma.<br /><br />Since the big 30 oz bag was $0.10 less per ounce cheaper than the individual bags I bought the 30 ounce bag with the INTENT of breaking it down into individual servings. I've not gotten that far yet but the fruits & nuts are so filling that I do find it easy to monitor my portions or just fill up a ziplock bag when I'm headed out the door.<br /><br />The one reviewer is correct about the price being so much cheaper at Costco vs Amazon - however, if you don't have an alternative I promise this product rocks so much that it's still worth the price per ounce at my household.

review/summary: Something Isn't Right
review/text: I bought these expecting to fall in love with them because I love malt vinegar and potato chips.  On the outside of the original box packaging there was grease all over the place and when I opened up a bag to try them, there was a very foul, rancid oil type smell and also the same taste when I took a nibble off of the chips.  I opened more bags and every single one smelled and tasted the same.  I think the ones I got must be a bad batch but they are awful!  I got a sick stomach just from taking tiny tastes off of a couple chips.  I hope everyone else has better luck.

Pucker up and enjoy (but try not to become addicted).

review/summary: Best potato chips I've ever had!
review/text: After trying many different types of thick potato chips, this is one of the best.<br /><br />Other brands of 'kettle' chips usually has a lot of dark discolored chips.  I'm not sure if that is from overcooking or using poor quality potatoes.  An example of that is a certain popular name brand that has the word 'kettle' in it.  In contrast, Boulder Canyon's Totally Natural potato chips are usually bright yellow throughout with consistent potato flavor.<br /><br />The only issue I've ever had is sometimes you get a rancid batch.  When this happens, it usually affects the entire batch (with the same batch number).  Because of those previous experiences, I now sample one bag.  If it tastes normal, I'll usually collect the entire stock (that has the same batch number).  It's kind of funny when a few customers start staring at my shopping cart full of potato chips at the checkout counter.<br /><br />If buying online, please buy from vendor with decent customer service, such as Amazon.<br /><br />I have purchased these from Whole Foods Markets and Fry's Electronics in the past.  WFM probably does not stock them anymore.<br /><br />Some close alternatives (in case you can't find Boulder Canyon):<br />Lay's Kettle Cooked Original<br />Fresh & Easy's Kettle Cooked Original Salted<br /><br />I have purchased well over 100 bags of these Boulder Canyon Totally Natural for my family's consumption.  They are definitely a family favorite!

review/summary: Subtle
review/text: If you want a lot of "pow!" in the way of salt and vinegar....this is not your bag of chips.  By that I mean that the malt vinegar flavor is fairly subtle.  It has a slight sweetness like you'd figure from malt vinegar.  The chips are nice and crispy, however smallish, which is fine for a small bag as such.  Overall...good flavor, salty enough, slightly tangy/sweet.  I shall very much enjoy the remainder of the case I bought, but may try a case of something else in seek of something with a little more bang.  Having said that, I appreciate that they use real malt vinegar solids and sea salt. Unlike some "kettle type chips" that use cheap acid variants that simulate the salt and vinegar flavor, but leave your mouth and tongue feeling like you swabbed your mouth out with sandpaper.<br />If you like Salt and Vinegar chips, they are certainly worth a try to see if they fit your taste.

review/summary: Salt & Cracked Pepper Canyon Cut.  OMG The Best Chips I've Ever Had By Far. Delecious
review/text: These chips are/were Delicious, I wish I had ordered more while they were on sale. These chips are similar to ruffles but better seasoning. the salt is just right and the robust pepper gives it a "umph" that tantalizes your toungue but not spicy hot. These have a built-in overindulgence system, too much and the pepper becomes overbearing thus limiting your intake. I tripped the system many times.<br /><br />Only complaint is my chips were all broken up, I really do like a whole chip rather than scraps in bottom. they were like that in many bags. If Boulder can't fix that maybe they should package in cannisters like pringles.<br /><br />But taste is SOOOO Good, You won't regret ordering these. I would say these are for adults rather than kids due to sophisticated seasonings.<br /><br />Seems like this flavor is discontinued or out of stock. Sea salt & cracked pepper may be similar.

review/summary: Delicious Product, but the shipping?
review/text: I am a huge fan of Fruit Jells. I have been looking for a quality source to feed this hunger. after reading the reviews and checking out the price I took the plunge. I was/am very pleased with the taste and general freshness of the product that arrived. However, they were packed and shipped in a box within a box. as such, I found sugar leaking out of the container. I can deal with a little mess, but the vendor would be far better off packing them in plastic to keep them fresh and from leaking sugar, as I described.That said, the Jells are delicious, fruity and enjoyable. Thank you!

review/text: I bought this for a party. This rice is usually served with satays and peanut sauce which I also made. I must say I was really impressed with the taste of it. The rice is nice and sticky with nice coconut fragrance and taste. All I needed to do was to boil the rice packets in water for a couple of hours. The traditional way is to weave little baskets using coconut leaves, filling the leave baskets with glutinous rice and then boiling them (called ketupat). Imagine the amount of work and time saved with this!!! My guests also ate the rice pieces by dipping them in sugar. I'm planning to use this to make mango sticky rice as well as serve it with sweetened red bean paste. Super yummy!

review/summary: A Yummy Adventure!
review/text: Don't be afraid to try something new!<br /><br />So this matcha is very earthy smelling in the dry form. When I opened the bag there was really nothing remarkable about the smell other than sort of an earthy aroma mixed in with the matcha aroma. I shrugged and was like "okay" lol I just didn't know what to think. I have never heard of Lucuma let alone had Lucuma before so what do I know!?!<br /><br />I did however want to expand my horizons and the health benefits of Lucuma really interested me as well. Especially helping with skin inflammations and as an immune system booster!<br /><br />So I prepared the matcha of course and took a sip. It just tasted like matcha but of course a Red Leaf Tea quality matcha which equals GOOD STUFF!<br /><br />I added my ice and milk - as in my typical latte preparation of course, but this time did not yet add the splash of vanilla creamer. Took a sip - still the same - wonderful matcha flavor, but nothing else.<br /><br />So then I added my splash of vanilla low fat creamer, hummm now this is an interesting turn of events. I taste a light fruitiness here! Is it my imagination perhaps? Is it wishful thinking? Is it that somehow magically the creamer brought out the fruity flavor? Maybe it is a mental thing since this is now the way I usually enjoy my matcha - I have myself fooled into thinking things always taste better this way? I don't know. I am willing to admit if that is the case but maybe had I just added some sugar (there is sugar in the creamer I am sure - its not sugar free and even if it were it would have some kind of sweetener in it in the place of sugar right?). So I am thinking ... this must be a fruit that is complimented and made more predominant with the addition of some kind of sugar, not the creamer at all!<br />&#8232;So next time I have this I will leave the creamer out and add some sugar which ironically I had considered doing before adding my creamer but I just didn't want THAT much sugar in my matcha. Still for the sake of science next time I will!<br /><br />So then, how does this matcha TASTE? Well, its matcha tasting, with this light juicy like flavor similar to a melon. The fruit looks like an avocado to me. I looked up the Lucuma Fruit and found that it is supposed to have a flavor similar to a sweet potato and maple and you know what I do get that! Its light mind you the matcha flavor itself is the predominant flavor here. It is richer as a matcha though and I think that is due to the Lucuma! Still I get this melon flavor too. It truly is interesting and nothing about it tastes bad at all. I just don't really have my mind wrapped around it yet HOWEVER if you are adventurous and want to try something out of the box this is a good one to select for sure!

review/text: First saw this popcorn at Costco.  I've been hooked from the beginning.  The Zebra is good.  The cheese though, OMG is beyond great.  I got a bag of Utz cheese popcorn after this and it just didn't begin to compare.  The Utz (which I like) just tasted bland.  I've tried the Nacho and the White Cheddar, but group consensus is that the Cheddar is the best.<br /><br />Thankfully they don't carry it in the stores where I live or I'd be in trouble.  I generally order it for special occasions.<br /><br />Try it, you won't be disappointed!

review/text: No I have not yet tried the famous "Garrett's popcorn" but I can't imagine it being better than this stuff. I originally sampled it at my local Cost-Co and since then have NOT been able to get enough. It's so good. I recently bought more from Amazon and the shipping (with the Prime membership) was so fast and everything arrived fresh and delicious. I would recommend this popcorn to anyone. The only suggestion I have is maybe a better variety in terms of how the different flavors are packaged together. I wish the cheddar cheese(their best flavor) could come in more packages than just the grouping of the kettle and caramel corn. I've actually haven;t had a chance to try any of the other flavors (other than those 3) because I HAVE to have my cheddar and it only seems to come with those flavors and buying it separately is just a little more than I want to spend on popcorn right now. But I WILL be gifting these to friends and family this Christmas. YUM!

I'm guessing by the expiration date on these cones that they've been sitting on the shelf quite a while and it's the sugar coating that's protecting the other flavors.

review/summary: Very Tasty but Holy Calories!
review/text: I had really mixed feelings about this product because the popcorn is so caloric, it might as well be a fat pill. So, it sat there for a couple of days. I had to plan my workout (I realize how lame this makes me sound, but it's true) before I was even willing to go down this path because when you look at the cone, it doesn't look like it has a whole lot of product and being a popcorn fiend and I fully expected that an entire bag would be devoured in 5 minutes....<br /><br />Anyways, workout later, I sat down to eat my special treat and it was AMAZINGLY flavorful! Flavor alone, definitely 5 stars. Flavorful so much that you don't feel the need to gobble the entire thing down in one sitting and I can normally eat one or two bags of popcorn in one sitting.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent and it will keep the popcorn fresh due to its sealing. - 4 stars only because once you open it, it's impossible to really seal again.<br /><br />Calories - Dreadful... I have never seen a popcorn treat be over a thousand calories a bag... but it's so wickedly yummy.<br /><br />Would I buy again? Yes

review/summary: Very disappointing product
review/text: I was hoping that this Margaret Holmes "Peanut Patch" product had improved over time. It has not. I used to buy them when I couldn't get the fresh ones while I was in the military stationed all over the world. Alas, still the same product as before. Dinky peanuts, many empty shells, rotten peanuts inside (along with the occasional sticks, stems, grit, and other unknown debris). And the worst part - the peanuts are not processed in a manner in which the peanuts come out of the shells easily. A lot of shells are either soggy or undercooked. Anyone that knows and loves boiled peanuts knows what I'm talking about. You try and "crack" the majority of these and the peanut separates into halves and you have to pry them out of the shells each half at at time with a toothpick or something. You can't squeeze them out or they'll crush, wasting the peanut. Not good. And these "Cajun" ones. Wow. They use some type of catsup-tasting thing with some type of pepper. I do not reccommed this product at all. The cans that they come in are heavy and you'll pay more for shipping than the actual product. I've been eating boiled peanuts for 40 years. If you REALLY want some good boiled peanuts, with a good variety, try Hardy Farms. I wish I could get them on Amazon, but they aren't available.

She likes the flavor. The only thing she sayed negative was the shells were hard on some of them but that was not a problem to her. That's why I rated 4 stars instead of 5.

review/summary: as close to the real thing as you can get!
review/text: I purchased a case of Tropico's after seeing them advertised on a gluten free blog. I was skeptical but once I received them (very quickly I might add) I was not disappointed. The texture is virtually identical to the gluten-fruit loop version. They have a nice sugar coating and are very colorful. The flavors are all natural so its obviously NOT identical to the traditional version's flavors but you can avoid all of the chemicals and colorings so its really a bonus. My kids love these so much, for breakfast and to use in craft projects. Great job Freedom Foods!

review/summary: Decent product, same shipping problem
review/text: The product itself was fine.  I bought it for my son's preschool, as he's very sensitive to food dyes and they were planning to do a "froot loop" project.  I figured the 5 boxes would be a good donation to the school to use in place of artificially dyed cereal rings with all of their classes.  While the rings were a little smaller than the typical "froot loop" and the colors were not quite as bright as shown on the box, they were still colorful and the teachers tell me the kids thought they tasted good, too.<br />Unfortunately, as with many other reviewers' experiences, I received only one box instead of the five that are stated as coming in the order.  I contacted Amazon and they quickly sent me five new boxes at no charge, but it seems like this is an ongoing problem that certainly needs to be addressed.  While Amazon gets a thumbs-up for their quick fix and good customer service, I shouldn't have had to request a new order in the first place.

review/summary: Tastes Great, Needs CORRECT Delivery
review/text: My son and I are on the gluten free diet for allergy reasons. When I read about this cereal, I really wanted to try it. The cereal was delivered promptly, but I only got one box, not the "pack of 5". I paid nearly $30 for ONE cereal box. It wasn't worth it, and I won't try it again at that price. I thought when the description said, "285-gram BoxES (PACK OF 5)," that I was supposed to get 5. Did I read it wrong? The taste was great, especially for a gluten free option; however, like I said, it wasn't worth that price.

I felt like I was eating a bowl of air freshener so I looked at the ingredients again.  My guess is that the gardenia flower extract was what I was tasting and smelling.

review/text: This cereal tastes great.  The colors aren't quite as bold as what is shown on the box, but it uses natural food colorings, so I could really care less.  I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars only cause it's so expensive and the box is a little bit smaller than a normal cereal box.  If it were bigger or less expensive, I would have given it 5 stars.  But otherwise it tastes great.  Also, I ordered this and it's supposed to be 5 boxes of cereal in the order, I only received 1 box.  I contacted Amazon and they actually overnighted me a whole new shipment of 5 boxes, that arrived on a Saturday morning.  Great customer service! Thanks!

review/summary: ALMOST GUILT FREE
review/text: I accidently ran into this product. They where by the cashiers check out stand for $1.99 at TJ Maxx. I really wanted some chocolate but was watching what I ate at the time so to compromised I got the Organic Hard Candies in the Cherry flavor. However, I did not open them until about a week later. But when I did...wow. They were great. I had eaten two and was about to pop a third one in when I actually looked down at the candy and realized that it wasn't red. Which blew my mind since I thought I was tasting red. It was amber colored.I know that sounds weird. So I grabbed the bag and read the ingredients and saw that it was an all natural candy with only 4 ingredients. You cant beat that. And it tasted really good with out being overly sweet. I just went back to TJ Maxx and bought all the other flavors...I have 5 bags now. And I will savor them slowly. I don't mind paying $1.99 a bag...but $3.99 is a little my budget. But when I run out....I might just have to cave in. So I'm happy that Amazon has them.

review/summary: Absolutely Awesome
review/text: I've tried the Cherry and Pomegranate flavors.  Both are delicious.  They have a real, "normal" hard candy flavor only better (no weird sweetener flavors etc.).  I will point out that they have a very, very slight barley sugar quality, which if you ever had real old-fashioned hard candy, will make these taste real and authentic to you.  If you haven't had old-style hard candies, I think you will still like them and find it a much more pleasant taste than the stark, harsh sugar-bomb effect of most modern hard candies.<br /><br />They are of a good size, a good shape, last a long time, and while definitely hard candy, they aren't horribly sweet.  The real, fresh, tangy and tart fruit flavors come through loud and clear.  I think they have a wonderful flavor balance.<br /><br />When I lived in Los Angeles and had a horrible commute twice daily through dusty, polluted, desert-dry and hot conditions, I found these to be a necessary item to keep my throat comfortable (you don't want to be drinking a lot of water or coffee when stuck in commuting traffic!).  In that regard, they also serve very well as cough drops when you're sick.  I tried many different products and these were the ones I settled on as the best for both purposes.  Of note re using them when you're sick, these won't make any hot tea etc. you are simultaneously drinking taste weird, like many cough drops do.  These candies do not burn the roof of your mouth like some hard candies do, nor do they dissolve into sharp shard like pieces that feel like they would cut your mouth.<br /><br />Each candy is twist wrapped in a little piece of waxy paper.  They hold up surprisingly well to humidity etc. but they occasionally may eventually start to become a little stuck to the papers.  I didn't notice anything like this except for occasionally with ones I'd had in the car for months.  I never had one so stuck that it tore the paper or I couldn't get the paper off.  It really isn't a problem.<br /><br />I really liked the cherry flavor; as well as the pomegranate, and I've read many favorable reviews of the other flavors as well.

review/summary: The best store bought sauce
review/text: I love to barbecue and I was a big bulls eye fan and loved their sauces.  One day I bought the kansas city sauce from Cattleman's and I was really blown away. It was spicy, tangy and had a great texture.  I've tried it on meats and poultry and it is amazing.  My ribs are now the talk of everyone after using a dry rub and putting this on to finish them off.<br /><br />It has a great consistency; not too thick; and is easy to spread onto items with a brush.<br /><br />If you want a consistent and quality barbecue sauce that you can count on to be great with any food, this is the sauce.  Kansas City is my favorite but the Mississippi and Memphis is really good too with just the right amount of sweetness.<br /><br />For the mustard crowd there is Carolina which has a hint of cayenne and mustard and it's very tangy and delicious.<br /><br />I go out of my way to get Cattleman's sauces.  It may be hard to find at times in stores, but many of the chain grocery stores carry it.

review/summary: A cut above the rest
review/text: I don't claim to be an aficionado of barbecue sauce. I know some people are, and they have much more of a claim than me to say that Cattleman's is the best.<br /><br />But I have over the decades sampled a lot of different sauces, everything from the very generic to the much pricier. I had never tried this brand before because my local stores don't carry it. I came across it on Amazon entirely by accident when it was being sold at $10 for six bottles. That's pretty inexpensive for ANY barbecue sauce. I got some. What could I possibly lose?<br /><br />Cattleman's stands head and shoulders above anything else I have tried. As the description says, it has a sweet and tangy taste. However, the sweetness isn't the cloying taste you might get from corn fructose syrup. It tastes more like molasses. There is also a hint of smokey hickory taste. The base doesn't have a tomato-y taste. It's more in a class all of its own. While there are spices that help to give the sauce a sharply tart sense to it, this is in no way a hot sauce or something thst anyone would find too spicey.<br /><br />The overall effect is very, very pleasing. You can use this on pretty much anything from meat to omelets, hash browns, French fries, you name it.<br /><br />If you buy this, though, avoid the overpriced Amazon Marketplace vendors. Wait for Amazon to restock, lower the price, and sell it through its Prime plan. You'll be a much happier customer if you purchase it this way.
