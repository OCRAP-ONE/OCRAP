review/text: I have tried multiple different dog foods in an attempt to reduce the amount and foulness of my dog's gas.  This dog food has saved our noses!  Purina One for Sensitive Systems with yogurt was one of the many.  Shortly after we began using this dog food, our dog's gas problem went away.  We are now lifelong fans of this product!

review/text: Gave this to my mini schnauzer and by the second day he had gas and had to eliminate frequently. He refused to eat this on the third morning and so I just ordered some Wellness puppy formula for him. For dogs that are purebreed and need quality i would stress not feeding them this.

Shelly will eat this food eagerly.  She does not like Purina's blended dog food.<br />This product is also easy on her stomach and it helps give her a beautiful, shiny coat.  Shelly gives Purina One Chicken & Rice Dog Food a 4-paw salute and one, big tail wag.

review/text: My 5 year old Japanese Chin (12pounds) is a very picky eater with GERD. She prefers not to eat most days. I have tried many dog foods and this one she eats ALWAYS. She picks out the dark pieces and goes back after to finish the rest. She tends to be a gasy dog and I haven't noticed it get better or worse on this food. The biggest plus is that it has protein as the first ingredient and not a by-product.

review/summary: Great for Schnauzer's allergies
review/text: We have a one year old miniature schnauzer that has had allergy problems.  She was rubbing her eyes a lot and constantly licking her paws. We had to give her benadryl twice a day just for some relief so we decided to try a different food.<br /><br />About a week after completely switching to the Blue Buffalo food, her symptoms were almost completely gone.  She loves the food too. She would leave her old food sitting all day before finally eating it. Not this stuff. As soon as it hits the bowl she's chowing down.<br /><br />Great product. Can't guarantee it will help wit all dog's allergies because they can all be allergic to different things just like humans. But this dog food has a minimum amount of ingredients which is the first step in determining the cause of the allergies.

review/text: For years we did not know what was wrong with my Jack Russell terrier. He was chewing his paws raw and had him on steroid shots and perscrition antihistamines,benydryl. Never occured to me it was his diet. He had been on the same dog food for years before this started.Actually thought he was OCD due to loosing his buddy(our other Jack Russell terrier)So on a whim I did some research and found this food and decided to give it a try. After 2 weeks on this diet he stopped chewing and has actually started to heal and his wounds are closed, his hair has finally grown back in! hooray,no more bandages cleaning open wounds.His playful look and spirit is back too and this dog is 12 years old!!! thank god for this stuff!!!

I can avoid the annoying high-end pet food store with the shrieking parrots and the constant demands to donate or upgrade or repeat my phone number aloud for everyone in line. They don't even offer to take the heavy bags to the car any longer, which was a problem when I had lifting limits.

review/summary: two thumbs way up from our golden retriever, Sammie!
review/text: Sammie is what you would call a discriminating eater; and she loves her Blue Buffalo Basics Turkey and Potato. With most other dry dog foods, she turns her nose up by the second half of the bag,(even with those brands that she likes); but not Blue Buffalo Basics. It's good to the last morsel! Mix in just a little bit of warm water as a treat and she inhales it!<br /><br />Most importantly, Sammie has suffered from sensitive skin and food allergies for most of her life (she's 11); and she tolerates the Blue better than any other brand. She has no difficulty digesting the Blue Buffalo Basics either. It is definitely worth paying a little more for such an excellent product.  The Amazon.com price is as good as I've seen anywhere, as well.

review/summary: Not actually the same stuff as Dublin Dr Pepper
review/text: I believed when ordering this item that it was supposed to be basically the same thing as Dublin Dr Pepper.  The only difference was supposed to be that this doesn't say Dublin on it, and the Dublin Dr Pepper bottling company had nothing to do with it.  Upon actually drinking it, however, it does not taste like Dublin Dr Pepper.  It tastes more like the normal corn syrup variety - a somewhat harsher taste.  I'm not sure why this is.  Probably not worth buying at this price unless you can't handle corn syrup.

I am hoping that if money is a consideration to someone that this will save them from my experience.<br /><br /> Amazon is great and upfront with their shipping costs -- I will not purchase anything from Hometown Favorites LLC again.

review/summary: Grateful that this product is still made - absolutely love it!
review/text: While I love both the Vanilla & Maple varieties of Bun Bar (& have for years), I seem to be a tad partial to the Vanilla, & thus am leaving a review here (versus a page associated with the Maple [just to be clear, I have a strong affinity for both, lest those who love Maple think that I'm dissing it in any way]).<br /><br />Years ago, when I was a kid, there was a vending machine in a specific bowling alley that always stocked Bun Bars, & as such, that vending machine became a kind of 'gold standard' (in my opinion, at least), & would have garnered any first place ribbon regarding confectionary selection, if I had any say. :)<br /><br />And then for a while, & for years, I couldn't find these beloved Bun Bars in any stores or gas station mini-marts near me or anywhere I checked (which was a bummer, & had me concerned as to whether the product was still made [as ridiculous as it might sound, I couldn't imagine going the rest of my life without tasting another Bun Bar (yes, of my Top 3 favorite candy bar -type anythings, the Bun Bar ranks at the very top)]).<br /><br />A few years ago, one specific gift that I received at Christmas was the only thing which resulted in my emitting a rather loud, & utterly blown away, shriek/scream/celebratory yell... you guessed it - someone had surprised me by getting me a Bun Bar (well, several).  My shock was two-fold - I had no idea whether anyone I knew would recall my ever lamenting the unavailability of such (though then realized that someone had apparently heard me pining for this thing at some point), & suddenly having one before me was proof positive that the scrumptious delights were still being made, & were available (oh, how I love these things!).<br /><br />It will go down as being the only time in my life when the mere sight of a candy bar nearly brought tears to my eyes (I momentarily choked up [this is already an embarrassing review, so why not include that? ;) ], & kept commenting throughout the rest of that day that I was so happy that Bun Bars were still available [I probably got on someone's nerves at some point, but honestly, I couldn't have cared less (& by the way, the only thing which might have made the sudden 'reveal' all the more memorable would have been for someone to play Peaches & Herb's "Reunited" as I unwrapped the wondrous gift ["...reunited and it feels so good..."] [Pearson's, if you need someone to do a commercial for these things, & while playing that song, just give me a holler])]). ;)<br /><br />Now, I'm able to find these glorious gobs of goodness at gas station mini-marts near me, & at gas stations near various common destinations - & I'm sooooo glad, so relieved, & so utterly delighted every time I see these things available.<br /><br />I also seem to find myself doing a kind of impromptu 'recon' when in any store that sells candy (I want to know just where these Bars of confectionary gold are 'lying in wait')... ;)<br /><br />You've all heard of TGIF - well, TGFBB (Thank God For Bun Bars)... :)<br /><br />Bottom line - there is nothing else like a Bun Bar... & I love 'em!

review/summary: My Sheba thrives on this Senior food
review/text: My female Lab/Chow mix dog has just turned 16 years old. She is a little slower, doesn't jump up the steps 2 or 3 at a time anymore but her senses are still sharp. She has signs of Arthritis in her hips, her teeth aren't as sharp either! The Senior dog food from Purina is perfect for her. I do have to moisten it with a little warm water but she loves it that way too. Her weight isn't a problem as there isn't as much fat in this formula, much better for her advanced age. The stores here can't be relied on to have this formula on hand so it's much simpler, more cost effective and speedier to order it here. Very satisfied with the delivery, packaging and overall perfect product from an overall excellent supplier. Thank you Amazon!

review/summary: Misty gives it 5 stars
review/text: Our dog is 15, and we've been feeding her Purina One Senior for several years now. We actually mix a scoopful with 1/2 a can of dog food morning and evening. For most of her life she ate only canned food, and it seemed mean to switch her to a completely dry diet at this late date. However, we wanted to make sure she was getting good nutrition in her old age, and not too many calories. She seems to like this mixture, and has lost some of her excess pounds over the past few years. She still needs medication for arthritis, but carrying a little less weight has to help the strain on her joints somewhat. It's a bit cheaper than both an all-canned-food diet and the prescription dry food we'd tried buying from our vet.<br /><br />It's readily available at our supermarket and at discount stores, so why did I buy it here on Subscribe and Save? It's the kind of thing I've run out of one too many times, and I like the idea of it arriving automatically. Also, unless it's on sale, the supermarket price isn't that great and sometimes it's completely out of stock. It's a better price at places like Target and Pet Smart, but I really don't need any extra errands right now. I just hope it comes back in stock here in time for my next S&S shipment!

review/text: This tea is quite tasty, spicy and sweet. I'd love to drink it more often, but not only is it WAY overpriced considering the ingredients, but it's those very ingredients that make it unhealthy and not a good choice. Its first ingredient is sugar, but it also has an artificial sweetener (Splenda, yuck) and hydrogenated coconut oil (read: saturated fat). One K-cup has 14% of your saturated fat for the day in its 70 calories, plus 133mg sodium. It's just instant tea and powdered milk in there, too, leading me to wonder what's causing the high price.....<br /><br />Enjoy, but definitely in moderation!

review/text: Enjoying a cup of coffee is not a great option for me because I only enjoy it with a lot of high calorie creamer.  I have been buying the Gloria and Green Mountain hot chocolates because they are only 1 WW (Weight Watcher) points.  However, they always tasted watery and were just something I drank out of necessity to fill the void of snacking.<br /><br />Fast forward 50 pounds lighter and I purchased the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte and Dark Hot Chocolate at Bed Bath and Beyond (because it was all they carried and Amazon quit carrying the other brands) and I have never been so surprised!  What a fantastic flavor!  The Latte is 2 WW points and the Dark hot chocolate is 1 WW point.  I can even use the highest water option and I still get a rich full taste.<br /><br />If you are looking for an alternative to coffee, this will not disappoint!<br /><br />The only way I could be happier this Holiday Season if Amazon started carrying this product with Prime shipping!

review/text: I have always enjoyed Pacific Chai Latte. Liking my Keurig, I decided to try Cafe Escapes Chai Latte when I saw it. To begin with, I found the Pacific Chai was much creamier than the more watery Cafe Escapes Chai. The amount of spice in the CE Chai was overwhelming in taste, whereas the Pacific Chai spices lent a nice balance to the flavor of the drink. Lastly, I like the granularized honey in the Pacific Chai much more than the Sucralose in the CE Chai, which left a bad aftertaste in my mouth after each sip and required food or brushing teeth to get rid of.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn't buy or recommend the CE Chai.

I have seen the dark hot chocolate, many different coffees, and this tea. I was also able to use Kohls store credit card to obtain an extra 15,20 or 30% off (which is also a promotion that they offer about every 4-6 weeks it seems) So after being lucky enough to receive an additional 30% off the already low price of 9.99 I only paid about $7.00 plus tax. So for all of you that are looking for a decent chai at a reasonable price try visiting your local Kohls store

I was really wishing that these things would turn out great so I could save money on the coffee shops but this one is a no go.  Please don't waste your money.  It leaves a horrible after taste and definitely taste like dehydrated nastiness.  Save your money and buy some regular tea and poor milk in it, it will by far taste better than this stuff.

review/text: I do not drink coffee but love a good cup of Chai. My first impression upon sipping Cafe Escapes Chai Latte was that it was delicious!!!...creamy, rich and flavorful. Unfortunately, I soon noticed an after taste that ruined the experience. After reading the ingredients, I was unhappy to see that this company uses Sucralose, an artificial sweetener (see: dangers of sucralose).<br />The terrible after taste and unhealthy choice of using an artificial sweetener has caused me to give this product a poor rating.<br />I feel the negatives of the product far out weigh the company's attempt to make a low calorie drink. Green Mounta, how about making a Chai K-cup without the artificial sweetener.!

review/summary: Wow, this stuff was awful!
review/text: After reading so many good reviews, I felt compelled to buy this product. And man, it was horrible. First of all, they should really display prominently that this is not tea. It's some kind of tea flavored beverage.<br />I took a look at the used k-cup and it was completely empty. I would have expected some tea grounds left in there if it was real tea.<br />Also, it left a bad taste of artificial sweetener left in my mouth. Why couldn't they use real sugar? Or couldn't they mention that on the label also? Actually, it would have been better to not put in any sweetener and let the consumer add it themselves.<br />Upon further review of the ingredients, I also see partially hydrogenated oil. Yeeech...<br />Anyway, I must be in the minority on this one, but just so people know. I'd suggest you try it at a friend's place first before drop $12-18 on a box of fake tea.<br />I've had good results with some of the real tea that they sell in k-cups but this one was a dud.<br />By the way, I have a nearly new box of Cafe Escapes Chai Latte if anyone is interested in buying it at a discount!!  ;-)

review/summary: Beats a Starbucks $5 Chai any day!
review/text: I have been drinking Cafe Escapes Chai Latte for well over a year now with no complaints. The smell is absolutely delicious, reminding me of Christmas. The taste is full and spiced. I brew my cup and add in a splash of milk to mellow the flavor and cool the temp some- but that's me. My mother in law- who does not drink coffee period- enjoys a cup of Chai when she comes to visit. All in all, it's a nice break from the "coffee grind" and an excellent alternative for non coffee drinkers. I highly recommend you try it!

review/summary: The best pre-made chai latte I've ever had.
review/text: Making your own chai lattes with fine brewed chai tea, cream, spices, sugar, and all that is great, but let's face it you don't want to always have to "make" chai lattes to drink them.  Personally, my favorite pre-made chai latte mix has always been Big Train brand, but the downside is that the stuff is hard to find offline and when you can find it, it's very expensive in smaller amounts and I don't drink near enough to justify buying a 4 pound bag of the stuff.  I gave these guys a try just for the heck of it since, hey, I have a Keurig brewer..might as well try one of the hot drink mixes.  I was pleasantly surprised that these kcups were actually better than the Big Train stuff. Unlike a lot of pre-made chai latte mixes, this stuff is just slightly less sweet which allows the tea flavor more room to come out.  It's still sweet and tasty, but it tastes more like a tea drink rather than a sweet, sugary drink that happens to have chai tea in it.  There are a few things for buyers to take note of, though:<br />1. These work best when brewed at 6 or 8 ounces. 10-12 is a bit watery and the spice of the chai loses its emphasis.  It you do brew them at 10-12oz, add some cream to level out the flavor.<br />2. They are very low in sugar compared to most premade mixes (9g in one cup).  This is great for people like me who watch their sugar intake, but the downside is that this is done using sucralose, which some people have digestive issues with.  It would be nice to see alternatives to lowering the sugar that are more natural (stevia blends, isomalts, etc.) but as it stands, I must say I'm glad to see so many drinks for the Keurig brewers that are low-sugar compared to the over-the-top, corn syrup laden mixes you find so often in stores.<br />3. They are a bit pricey, there's no denying it.  However, as it is one of the most popular non-coffee types of K-cup, you can usually find deals if you snoop around enough online.

review/text: I love Chai Latte. Received my first at a gourmet coffee shop. It was awesome.<br /><br />Anyway, I had high hopes that these pre-packaged cups would capture that magic and I have to say I'm a fanboy now. I try to hold myself to two per week. I'm doing well, but the taste is perfect.<br /><br />When my wife said these Keurig machines made perfect coffee, I rolled my eyes. I bought her one (The B40) anyway (cue brownie points). She was ecstatic. I also bought hot chocolate cups too. I'm going to branch out into the regular teas too, since I'm a fan of good tea (no milk, no sugar). No, I'm not from the U.K.<br /><br />Buy this product now. Also, get on the Amazon Prime because its effortless and quick shipping.

review/summary: Delicious Chai Latte for K-Cups- but prices vary greatly
review/text: Cafe Escapes *Chai Latte* is a winner in my home and we go through boxes very fast.<br /><br /> {I did not give it a 5 star rating due to the pricing on the item at the time  I went to try and purchase it at Amazon.}<br /><br />The product in itself, is very good.<br /><br />You do not have to add anything to it- no creamer, no sugar.<br /><br />Those counting calories should know there is approx 2 teaspons of sugar per serving<br /> and roughly 70 calories a cup.<br /><br />That is far less calorie consumption than most of what is on the Starbucks menu and probably even less calories than a cup of coffee with creamer and sugar you might make yourself.<br /><br />*NOTE:<br /><br />I did find myself using the LARGEST CUP SETTING on my Keurig Machine for this brand, because if I used anything smaller, it would be way too sweet.<br /><br />The varied spices in it are a great blend and to clarify to those who never had Chai Latte, spicy in this instance, is more about being flavorful as opposed to the * hot or on fire* in the mouth type of spicy you find in certain foods.<br /><br />I find Chai Latte to be a hot 'comfort' drink- much like hot cocoa/chocolate is to many people.<br /><br />One thing to note about this brand's Chai Latte: Unlike other k-cups, THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE STORED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. YOU SHOULD ALSO SHAKE THE K-CUP BEFORE USING.<br /><br />I am unsure if this is because it is a tea( the room temperature storage).<br /><br />The instructions to shake the k-cup is, I am assuming, because this is a tea with spices and shaking it up may help create an even distribution in the k-cup.<br /><br />Totally conjecture on my part- but these are the instructions on the box.****<br /><br />Unfortunately, the prices on this product vary from reasonable to ridiculous.<br /><br />I love shopping at Amazon, but no one had this item cheaper than Bed,Bath and Beyond when I last needed to buy it.<br /><br />Price checking on the internet showed that the price was steep, for the most part, except for a few retailers.<br /><br />If Amazon comes down in price- I will certainly buy it here.

review/summary: Artificial Aftertaste
review/text: Wanting an afternoon treat that was not coffee and was not hot cocoa, I decided to try Caf&eacute; Escapes Chai Latte.  Yesterday, I brewed a 9.25 oz. cup - this was too thin and watery with no creamy texture.  Today, I decided to go down a size and found that the 7.25 oz. size was just right.  Felt a bit like Goldilocks, but that was ok.<br /><br />Now, the problem with going to the stronger setting is that the artificial aftertaste is much more intense.  Went looking at the ingredients and found Sucralose, which is the official name for Stevia.  I know that some say that they do not notice a strange taste or that they have developed a liking for this ingredient, but I have never developed a taste for it.<br /><br />Glad that I only purchased a small box and will be more cautious in the future when it comes to artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Brewed on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQSMPO">Keurig B60 Special Edition Brewing System</a>.

review/text: I love Chai Tea, so when my husband bought me a Keurig for Christmas, he also bought a box of this stuff.  I'm grateful that he also bought some coffees, because this Chai is terrible.  The spices are overwhelming, and upon my initial tasting, I thought my cup must still have some dish soap in it.  I poured that cup out and started over, but with no better results. I finally realized the strange taste was probably due to the sucralose and whatever combination of spices.  But the taste is not just a little odd, it is really undrinkable.

review/text: As I write this, I am drinking my first-ever cup of Cafe Escapes Chai Latte.  I have always found that to enjoy a hot drink, I must add flavored creamer, sugar, sugar substitute, honey, or (for hot chocolate) whipped cream.  Not this time!  For the first time in my life, I am enjoying a hot drink as-is, with no doctoring whatsoever.  The Chai taste -- a bit exotic, but enjoyable and itself a bit sweet -- is wrapped in a sweet, creamy "delivery system".  Warning: If you like your coffee or tea unsweetened, this drink might be too sweet for you.

review/text: I am not a big coffee fan but I wanted a Keurig maker. I absolutely love Chai Latte. I make two cups of it. I found that mixing it on the middle setting and one on the smallest cup setting mixed together makes it a perfect combination! It tastes just like when I used to buy it for 3x the price. It is creamy and the right amount of flavor. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice kick of flavor in the morning but ins't looking for the caffeine of coffee! I also enjoy this as a little treat since I am watching my weight and this doesn't make a big dent into the amount of calories I consume a day. I did wish I could find i for less expensive on Amazon as my local store has it for a better price but it is not always in stock.

review/summary: Awfully sweet
review/text: I was referred to this particular chai after trying another that was just too weak and boy was I disappointed.  I'm not sure what these other people are use to, but this brand of chai was WAY too sweet. It was as if someone dumped a half cup of sugar in there.  I was so looking forward to this and just couldn't choke down even one cup.  I'm going to leave the entire box on the counter at work and hope it disappears.

review/summary: Spicy Chai
review/text: I am a frequent imbiber of chai tea lattes, so I was excited for this almost instantaneous approach to making the delicious beverage. Unfortunately, I found the product too spicy for my tastes. If you like a good jolt to your taste buds, this drink is for you. If you prefer something smoother and milder, look elsewhere.

review/text: I had bought this product before and I really like it. It tastes just like a chai tea latte you<br />would get from Starbucks. The only reason I bought it online was because I couldn't find it<br />anywhere in stores. Wouldn't you know as soon as I ordered this at a very expensive price,<br />I found it again at Bed Bath and Beyond for much less. Everyone is carrying it now including<br />Target. So no need to pay the high online price any more.

review/text: The chai latte tastes pretty good, it does leave a filmy residue on the tongue though.  I suggest brewing the largest size your brewer will make.  Be sure to run a mock brew (water only) after brewing the latte though.  Just one latte clogged my brewer and I had to call Keurig for service.  Same goes for hot chocolate too.

review/summary: Great Chai!
review/text: This is the best Chai I've tasted, and I've tried quite a few brands/mixes.  I would even go so far as to say this K-cup is better than Starbuck's Chai Latte...problem with Starbucks is that it doesn't taste the exact same each time, depending on who makes it; so sometimes I liked it and sometimes it tasted bitter.  Not so with my K-cup.  Perfectly smooth and delicious each and every time. (not to mention the calories are much lower than other mixes that I've tried)  As of right now, Bed Bath and Beyond is much cheaper.  They are charging 9.99 for a box and with one of the 5.00 coupons they mail out regularly, not only is my Chai latte perfect, it's downright cheap!!!

review/summary: Artificial Sweetener Warning
review/text: I am a big fan of chai lattes and the spices in this blend are quite tasty. If you use the recommended 8oz setting, it has a full enough flavor. My biggest complaint is the artificial sweetener. It leaves that horrible chemical aftertaste that diet sodas do. If you don't have a problem with Splenda and you like spiced chai, this is the K-cup for you! If you are like me though, and have an aversion to artificial sweeteners, it looks like we are still stuck with brewing the tea (such as Celestial's India Spice Chai) and adding our own milk and sugar.

However, like others, I got the 30% off (and free shipping) from Kohls, which made the cost totally reasonable. Wouldn't but it here, but would recommend it to anyone who likes the Oregon mix if you purchase it elsewhere. Great product!

review/summary: Funny taste
review/text: I've been a Chai drinker for a long time and have tried many brands and types of Chai. Good Earth makes a very spicy excellent teabag Chai. Tazo makes both great teabags and concentrate. Celestial Seasonings makes a gentle Vanilla Chai that's not too spicy or too bland. So the variety out there is great. I was excited about the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-cups because I would be able to have a lovely Chai without adding sugar or milk to the brewed tea.<br /><br />I cannot drink a full 8 ounces because the taste is so weird. This Chai has a soy base instead of milk. I'm not opposed to soy milk at all and enjoy it on cereal but in this Chai it adds a funny taste to the tea. Maybe it has to do with the powdered aspect of the soy milk - powdered milk also has a strange taste.<br /><br />In any case I'm glad I only bought one 16 pack. It'll wait in my cupboard until I find a friend who enjoys it or it expires. I also did not find it too sweet as other reviewers did, but I like my Chai sweet.

My daughter doesn't like it much either and she's no where near as picky as I can be.

review/text: I have become a big fan of hot tea since buying my Keurig a few months ago and since I've always loved Chai Lattes, I thought this would be great.  It did not live up to expectations.  While the aroma is wonderful (spicy, warm and sweet), the taste is watery and leaves an after taste like bad artificial sweetener.  And it is heavy on the sweet.  I tried a couple of cups and didn't finish either.  I wish Keurig could come up with a latte K-Cup that tastes like Latte.  I love all the coffees, teas and even the hot cider but anything that I've tried that should have had a creamy consistency like hot chocolate, white hot chocolate or this chai latte have all been watery and unpleasant.  So, for now at least, I'm sticking to just the tea and adding my own milk or cream.

review/summary: MANY USES - ALL ARE YUMMY.
review/text: First, I must say that I agree with the first reviewer here on two points.  Like that reviewer, I am fond of high salt soups and with Campbell soups, as others, that is what you get unless you specifically buy the low salt content variety.  Secondly, the reviewer was correct in the fact that the Campbell Company is pretty skimpy of the celery bits in this one.  The taste of this soup is great but it would be nice if it had more celery in it.<br /><br />But for me, the lack of celery is sort of moot.  I use this soup, along with several other varieties of condensed soups for cooking.  With the exception of the tomato soup, I seldom eat just a plain can of soup...although the other stuff, including this one, is not bad if that is what you want.  No, I use these soups primarily for cooking up quick dishes; some of which I glean from the backs of cans, cookbooks and word of mouth; others I invent myself.  As an example, this cream of celery is one of the several ingredients I use for my potato soup; you know, the soup I tell everyone comes from the secret recipe passed down through seven generations of our family and brought over from the `Old Country."  That of course is a blatant lie but I know it, they know I know it and they know I know that they know I know it but they are too polite to say anything about it.  They just eat the soup and enjoy it.<br /><br />"The Soup"  (This is a secret recipe...please do not pass this on to ANYONE!)<br /><br />Potatoes - how ever many you want. (I like lots of them)<br />Two cans of Cream of Celery Soup<br />One can of Cream of mushroom Soup<br />One can of Cheese soup<br />One can of what ever other kind of cream soup you have..asparagus is good.<br />Two rather large white or yellow onions.<br />Several stalks of celery.<br />Bacon bits - or finely chopped ham - how ever much you want.<br />Milk<br />Half and Half<br />Pepper<br />Paprika<br /><br />I peal and cut up a bunch of potatoes in smallish and square sort of pieces.  I dice up the two onions. I thinly chop up the celery. These are put on the stove to boil.  Boil the onions and potatoes until the potatoes are sort of soft but not too soft.  You don't want a bunch of potato mush here.<br /><br />Drain the potato and onion mix.<br /><br />Add the bacon bits or chopped ham<br />Add all the cans of the various soups.<br />Add the salt (lightly or to taste)<br />Add the pepper and paprika - to taste<br /><br />Add milk...several cups and add the half and half.  Add these two until you get the consistency you want.<br /><br />Place on stove top and start heating it.  Do not let it come to a full boil.  Make it hot.  Let it simmer well.  Make sure you stir it well and often.<br /><br />Depending upon how many potatoes you use and how much milk you add, this makes up a lot of soup.  I serve this with toasted garlic bread or bread sticks.<br /><br />If as you cook this stuff, taste it constantly.  If you do not like what you taste, then simply root through your pantry and throw in something else until you get the taste you want.<br /><br />Try this soup.  I can almost promise you that it will become a family winter favorite.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of dozens upon dozens of uses I have found for this particular soup.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: the usual delicious soup
review/text: This soup was delicious as usual because I love HIGH SALT soups, however, I was disappointed in there being only a small amount of celery pieces per can.  I ate the asparagus soup recently and it was loaded with asparagus...yummmm! but this soup was basically plain.  I won't be buying this type of soup again because of this lack of celery flavor.  It will be fine to use on chicken or as any other topping but, in my opinion, not as a celery tasting soup.

review/text: I found Deep Cello earlier this summer and have been enjoying roastmaster Justin Kagan's great take on coffee.  Every one I've tried I've found terrific and "High Jump" is no exception!<br /><br />You can easily tell it's not just another coffee as soon as the beans are ground.  It's an amazing mix of complex aromas.  Nuts, chocolate, light spices..all there.  And the good news is it survives the brewing process.  You still have those rich flavors.<br /><br />I'm almost always one to add a bit of half and half to my coffee.  For this, as the other coffee from Deep Cello, it's really more an option.  Sometimes I will, but sometimes I feel it takes a bit away from the coffee.  As their coffees are never over roasted, they never are bitter.  Thus, the cream being something I'll not always take.<br /><br />So there it is!  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Surprise! I love it!
review/text: Ordinarily I do not drink sweet coffee, and all the iced k-cups I've tried have been gooey and bitter. I tried this one when Green Mountain had a special, and now I'm ordering more for my daughter! It is very sweet, and makes a relatively small amount (the "iced" setting on my Cuisinart brewer is sends only 4 ozs. over the ice, and I wouldn't recommend more than 5-6 cubes in the glass). But brewed that way you get a refreshing, sweet, nutty drink. It's really rather strong this way, and has a surprising caffeine kick, which I don't get from my hot hazelnut brew. With record-breaking temps in Atlanta this year, it's a welcomed treat!

review/summary: Tasty stuff
review/text: I was sorely disappointed with the flavors that came in e sample pack I got; they all tasted like diet, saccharine blech.<br />At e local Sur la Table store I found the Sparkling Naturals pink grapefruit flavor. It is fantastic. Not too sweet, tastes like grapefruit and is not made with artificial sweetener. Two thumbs up.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is it is messy. When trying to pour from the measuring lid into the bottle the syrup dribbles down the side, onto your pants, the bottle, the floor, etc. To fix this I now measure in the lid, pour it into a small measuring cup and then into the carbonated water.

review/summary: Pink Grape Fruit Natural--Exceeded Expectation
review/text: I dislike artificial flavoring in general, so I chose the natural flavors. I am also not a big fan on sweetened soda, but like carbonated water.<br /><br />Though I was dubious when I bought the soda mix after owning the soda machine for a few months, the grape fruit flavor turned out very good, probably as good or better than any commercially bottled soda available on the market for my taste. The bottled ones that I like include, Orangina, a sparkling apple cider from California, and a sparking pear juice for Sweden. This home made grape fruit is a good and cheaper alternative.<br /><br />Now I want to try their pear mix.

review/summary: For My Guests.
review/text: I first saw Mexican Coca-Cola at my local warehouse store. What is this, I wondered? Then I read an article about it and the story about how American Coke had been gradually changed and no longer was made with cane sugar. It seems that the U.S. Coke is made with corn syrup. Mexican Coke was said to be like the old-fashioned American Coke I knew and loved as a kid, so it seems. Actually, I preferred Pepsi and you got twice as much for your dime. Well, I just had to try Mexican Coke and I bought a case. It's quite delicious, and is indeed better than the Coca-Cola generally purchased in the U.S. I suppose you could say that it's gourmet Coca-Cola.<br /><br />In any case, I seldom drink anything except diet soft drinks because of a calorie problem I have. However, I have friends, relatives and guests that won't drink diet drinks. So, I always have a few bottles of Mexican Coke in the fridge. I offer it with a slight explanation and people seem to love it. They're almost always amazed. The novelty is worth the extra price.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: The best
review/text: Simply no better Coke than Mexican Coke made with pure cane sugar. Save a bunch and pay no shipping if you buy at Sam's Club, I buy a couple cases a month. Sorry... I love Amazon but it's a much better deal at Sams.

review/summary: Mexi-Cola is the one for me!
review/text: I tried this when I first started avoiding high fructose corn syrup. I NEEDED my Coke fix, so I tried the Mexi-Coke and didn't care for it much at the time. Fast forward a few months with NO soda...I tried Mexi-Coke again and fell in love. I really enjoy it a lot now and if I ever happen to drink regular Coke with HFCS, it tastes nasty in comparison (like dirt or something).<br /><br />That having been said, I cannot believe the price here on Amazon!! I can get a case of 24 for around $20 at my local warehouse store. Or, I could go to one of many tiendas or coffee shops and buy single Mexi-Cokes for $2-$2.50. What a rip off, Amazon! Not cool at all.
