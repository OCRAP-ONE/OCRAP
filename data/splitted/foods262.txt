review/summary: A Passable Soft Cookie
review/text: I like the packaging.  It's quiet, muted, with no bold reds or other screaming colors, no out-of-place graphics or strange fonts.  I like the nice soft tan/sand with a strong, healthy blue and chocolate brown, a very good palette to match with the product.  The package is pleasing to the eye, and shows the product well.  That's coming from a guy closing on 50; this probably would be the perspective of a younger demographic.<br /><br />When it comes to soft cookies, all are measured by the inimitable standard of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00512RI1Q">Archway</a>.  Is it as good as an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006R0AG4W">Archway</a> soft cookie?  Well, this product is not.  Sorry.  But, this is not to say this is a bad cookie.<br /><br />Each cookie is individually packaged, six to a box.  The cookie measures just short of 3.5" across (that's a nice round 90mm for our international friends).  Thankfully, there is none of that really artificial, factory smell of preservatives and softeners that you can get with many soft cookies.  That is a big plus for this product.<br /><br />My experience with six of these cookies is that there's an awful lot of oatmeal, and not really that much chocolate or almonds.  The dark blotches of chocolate and the whitish blotches of almond pieces are visible enough on/in the cookie, top or bottom (not like the photos on the package, naturally), but neither really comes through in either mouth texture or taste.<br /><br />I also found these to be somewhat dry.  A couple of the cookies had started to break/fracture right out of the packaging, and this may have been a function of how dry they were.  They are soft cookies, well, soft enough, but they don't have that resistance to pulling them apart, none of that sexy pull-apart squishiness you get in the TV commercials.<br /><br />Although the box tells you that this is a good source of fiber (true) and that you're getting wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UT5H3E">Quaker whole-grain oats</a>, this is not a sugar-free or otherwise clearly good-for-you product.  It's sugar and chocolate, at 180 calories and 70g of fat per cookie, more than 1,000 calories in the box.  This product is not about diet or longevity--it is about indulgence.  And guilt.<br /><br />Bottom line: would I eat a box of these to save the rain forest?  Sure.  Would I encourage an unattractively thin model to eat one?  Yes.  Would I feed them to my family?  Yes.  Would I eat one instead of an Archway apple-filled oatmeal?  Sorry, no way.  Soft-cookie technology has advanced by leaps and bounds in our lifetime, a testament to the thousands of dedicated and bespectacled men and women working in the deeply buried top-secret cookie development bunkers around the world, but they need to stay down there and keep working a little harder.  This one is pretty good, but still not quite there.

review/summary: Soft Tasty Oatmeal Cookie
review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH96">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> is a tasty, satisfying dessert.  It has a mild oatmeal flavor and is packed with almond pieces (most of which are not very crunchy), and soft chocolate pieces.  The texture is more crumbly than chewy.  It is a pretty big, and I found it quite filling.  One was more than enough.  Two, and I would have felt bloated.<br /><br />Although the chocolate flavor does not stand out, this cookie delivers.

review/summary: Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond
review/text: Only 4 stars because I don't think they are worth $1 for each cookie. The grandkids loved them and so did the adults. Plenty of chocolate to have some in each bite but not as many almonds as I would have liked. They were moist and chewy and tasted like they could have been homemade. Tasted fresh. I think the price is in the individual packaging inside the box.

review/summary: Too Many Calories for One Tasty Cookie
review/text: These cookies are tasty, but 180 calories per cookie?  Quaker may think that they are nutritious because they contain oats and fiber, but what about the calorie count which is way too high for just one cookie.  I will not buy this product again.

review/summary: Tastes Good
review/text: If you like a soft cookie this one may be for you.  The Chocolate and Almond flavor comes through in just the right amount.  Each cookie is sealed in it own pouch so when you open it up it is fresh.  They come 6 packs to the box.  If you need fiber in your diet you can get 4 g per cookie.  You also get 180 calories per cookie.  While the label on the box states that the cookies are made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats (and they are) they are also made with wheat.  If you read down the ingredients they also contain soy bean oil.  While this is not important to most people it is to any allergic or sensitive to either ingredients. These would be great to keep in the car for a quick snack or to put in a lunch box for children to take to school.

review/summary: Not enough chocolate chunks
review/text: I was looking forward to trying these, but they did not live up to my expectations. Not enough chocolate chunks, almost enough almonds. The manufactured taste is not something I crave. I had never thought to put almonds into cookies, as opposed to walnuts which I don't like. This give me a great idea to make homemade chocolate chip cookies with almonds! I love soft baked cookies, these hit the spot in that department, but failed in flavor.

review/summary: not bad, but won't buy again
review/text: I really liked how they were individually wrapped.  Bummer that a box only has 6 cookies in it, doesn't feel like much value.  The cookies didn't have a whole lot of chocolate in them, so a little disappointed in that.  They were soft which I like, yet still seemed to be a little dry and crumbly, which I did not like.  4 grams of fiber is nice, and 9 grams of sugar is nice and low for a sweet treat (our household limit per serving of something sweetened is 9 grams sugar), but at 180 calories per cookie, you won't see our family eating too many of these.

review/summary: For specific times and specific reasons.....maybe.
review/text: So far four of the people in my family who have tried these cookies have not liked them enough for me to buy them.  I'm really glad I got to try a sample before I was tempted in the grocery store because Quaker is one of my favorite brand names.<br /><br />The fact that they are portion controlled in a single-cookie-pouch is a plus if you want to make it harder on yourself to *accidentally* overeat sweet cookies.  Each cookie is 180 calories.<br /><br />If you want to have something to pack in a lunch box or stash in a drawer at the office, these will remain fresh for quite a while.  My box has an October 25, 2012 best-used-by date -- about three months at least.<br /><br />Of the six packets in the box, four cookies were whole and two were broken.  The cookie is soft but very dry which was interesting because the chocolate chunks melt on contact with your fingers.  The chocolate was soft, the almond pieces were firm, and the whole oat grains were slightly tough.  My first impression was dry with a sawdust-like texture.<br /><br />Overall, I would suggest having this treat with something liquid - coffee, hot tea, milk.  It actually does look like a fresh home baked cookie so it is attractive to the eye.  The chocolate chunks and almond pieces were large enough to be easily identifiable and the cookie was not overly sweet, just enough to satisfy a craving for something to treat yourself with.  This product will not be a favorite with my family, but I can certainly see where they would be convenient for specific reasons and at specific times.

review/summary: Filling, But A Little On The Dry Side
review/text: Overall, I liked the cookies for their flavor, pleasant aroma and texture.  However, while somewhat moist and pleasantly chewy, they did taste a little dry. I had a few with my usual coffee, and they paired quite well.  I also had a few with milk, and that didn't turn out well.<br /><br />The cookies actually reminded me of a few of the high-fiber energy bars on the market.  The cookies themselves were heavy on the oats and quite generous with the chocolate (but not the almonds).  Each cookie was quite substantial and just two of them with milk could be a satisfying meal.<br /><br />The cookies were soft and chewy, but not at all gooey, like eating a jelly bean or peanut butter.  The oat content had good consistency and the total cookie was pleasing to nibble on.<br /><br />Would I buy the product if given the chance?  Probably not, as it is not a good dippin' cookie.  I tried pairing it with milk, and it did not dip well (it fell apart when wetted), though it did taste good with milk.  Still, the fiber content and heft alone have their merits, and in a pinch, I would definitely take a few bites.

review/summary: Tasty and good snack size.
review/text: I love oatmeal, and supposedly oatmeal is really good for you when you are breastfeeding, which I am right now. So the more oatmeal the better for me!<br />First off the individual wrappers are really easy to open. The cookie is very soft when bitten into just like the name implies it is soft. To me the cookie taste just like oatmeal, I like the taste of it. I saw another reviewer said it tasted like cardboard but I don't think it has that type of taste at all.<br /><br />The amount of chocolate and almonds is almost as consistent as the image shows. There a nice bit of almond and chocolate on each cookie. The cookie is about 3-1/2 inches wide so it is a nice size cookie for a snack.<br /><br />Each wrapper contains the nutrition facts which are per cookie: 42g, 180 calories, 8g fat (2g saturated fat, 0 trans fat, 1.5g polyunsaturate fat, 4g monounsaturated fat), 160mg sodium, 26g carbohydrates, 9g sugars, 3g protein. The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour, followed by enriched flour.<br /><br />I think both kids and adults alike would like this cookie. Great on the go snack if you like oatmeal.

review/text: I was very excited to tear into this box of cookies when it arrived today, and I am sorry to say I'm left a little let down. The cookies are soft, but they are also rather dry and crumbly. I'd place it in between a Grandma's brand cookie (nice and tender) and a pecan sandie/chips ahoy type cookie (deliberately, delightfully crispy). I really couldn't taste much almond or chocolate, either, which was sad.<br /><br />So while they're not gross, I could definitely make a similar cookie at home and it would be *much* more tasty and tender - not to mention with far fewer ingredients in.

review/summary: 'Soft baked' is catchier than 'crumbly-blandness'
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:09 Mins<br /><br /></span>These cookies have an earthen texture and consistency that conjures up images of the mud pies and beach sand cakes my sons used to make. The ingredients note no less than three preservatives (TBHQ, BHT and citric acid) and nearly as many adjectives as nouns - Modified, Enriched, Bleached, Reduced and Artificial.<br /><br />Ugh.<br /><br />Instead of referencing my thesaurus for more words to express the crumbly-blandness of these cookies, I decided to make a short video. I'm sure it better illustrates the appetite-suppressing texture. As for the underwhelming taste, I turned to another resource: my sons (ages 9 and 8) are excellent food critics, albeit not the most discerning ones. I need only leave a plate of food within arm's reach while they play board games, their Xbox 360 or watch a movie. Snacks like watermelon, popcorn or licorice, disappear quickly.<br /><br />However, both boys passed on the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie opened for the video review. That sums it up for me.<br /><br />Rating: One star.<br /><br />Do you need to satisfy a sweet tooth? I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BPVB9S">Eat. Think. Smile. Crispy Thins, Sweet Cinnamon</a> instead.

review/summary: (1.5 stars) Tasty? Maybe if you enjoy the taste of sawdust and cardboard.
review/text: As a self-professed cookie connoisseur, I was excited to try out Quaker's new oatmeal cookies. Unfortunately I cannot express my disappointment enough. While they may not be hands-down the worst cookies ever, they are far from even being mediocre and taste nothing like any oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten. They're a very dry and gritty cookie (I'm talking sawdust dry grit here) that taste of preservatives and, oddly enough, sugary blandness. If cardboard was more crumbly, I imagine it'd taste about the same with sugar and preservatives added. The chocolate and almonds may have an alright flavor, but what little is added isn't enough to salvage these cookies and the rest of the cookie overwhelms the taste of those two ingredients with its grit and dryness. After eating one cookie, I had absolutely no desire to have another one. Ever. Purporting to be a "healthy" cookie (relatively speaking, they are cookies after all), they do have four grams of fiber and three grams of protein, but at 180 calories with two grams of saturated fat, there are much better alternatives out there. Say, ones that actually taste good. And I haven't even touched upon the mega list of ingredients in these suckers, which is long, way longer than any "healthy" cookie should have. While the packaging has the proclamation that these are "Naturally Flavored", they also fail to mention there are artificial flavors included as well. You can be assured I'll not be getting these again and will be cautious about other Quaker products, those that venture beyond regular oatmeal that is, from now on. While each of the six cookies is individually wrapped to easily grab-and-go, it's almost as easy to take any cookie and put it in a baggie or container. I don't recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH96">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> unless you just cannot pass them up and they're on sale at a super low price, otherwise you won't miss a thing.<br /><br />P.S. Drowning them in (soy)milk doesn't help the taste either. Perhaps just drowning them in the toilet would be for the best.

review/summary: Not craving this mediocre cookie
review/text: I have to admit I was a bit disappointed in this cookie--the marketing promises whole grain Quaker Oats, plenty of fiber, and "natural" chocolate and almond flavor. Plus it comes from the good folks at Quaker Oats. And yes, whole grain oat flour is listed first among the ingredients, and yes, each cookie contains 4 grams of dietary fiber (16% of the RDA). The taste, however (and let's be honest, here--why else does one eat a cookie?), leaves much to be desired. It's superior to run-of-the-mill hard-baked chocolate chip cookies, but that's not really saying much. As soft-baked cookies go, this one is just mediocre. The chocolate flavor is not especially rich, the almond flavor is so subtle that it's almost undetectable, and the cookie's overall texture and flavor are decidedly bland. If I'm going to eat 180 calories worth of cookie, I'm going to opt for a much tastier indulgence than this.

You can taste the oatmeal which is nice as some other oatmeal cookies you can only taste the added ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, a milder cookie that was a little dry, but not too dry, still soft, good oatmeal flavor, sweet but not too sweet.<br /><br />If that is what you are craving then give these a try.

review/summary: I know it's a cookie, but...
review/text: Quaker advertises their Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies as made of whole grain oats and a good source of fiber. It says so on the box. It also contains enough oils, fats, and butter to have one cookie make up 8 grams, or 12 %, of your daily recommended intake for total fat. One cookie. And it says so on the box.<br /><br />They are soft and come separately packaged for lunch boxes. I think the separate packaging is to prevent the cookies from falling apart.  The box also says they contain chocolate and almond. I think out of the 2 cookies I tasted, there was a hint of chocolate with the taste of almond. To me, they are bland, chalky and not very palatable.<br /><br />I know it's a cookie, but it doesn't taste like one and the high fat content with low quality flavor will prevent me from purchasing them in the future.

The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond is okay but I would likely never buy them. The taste is not as good as the homemade or Chips Ahoy and I not fond of the texture as well. They are a bit bland and not that soft. They are also filled with the usual large list of chemicals found in most commercial products of this type. I realize they must be preserved to last for months and must retain their softer texture through artificial means. I will likely finish the box I have, but cannot really recommend them.

review/summary: Soft and Tasty
review/text: Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are appropriately named, they are soft, slightly chewy, oatmeal cookies with crunchy almonds and bits of chocolate.  Each cookie comes in its own sealed packet, so they are great for lunches or a pocket snack.<br /><br />I shared these cookies with three other people and they all liked them as much as I did.  While they can't compete with my mom's homemade oatmeal cookies (few cookies can) they are still very good.<br /><br />The nice thing about oatmeal cookies is that oats and almonds actually have some health benefits.<br /><br />Benefits of oats:<br /><br />-  Oats contain beta-glucans, a soluble fiber which has proven effective in lowering blood cholesterol.<br /><br />-  Oats contain tocotrienols. Tocotrienols are antioxidants which inhibit cholesterol synthesis and have been found to lower blood cholesterol.<br /><br />-  Eating oats can spread the rise in blood sugars over a longer time period.<br /><br />Benefits of Almonds:<br /><br />-  Almonds lessen after-meal surges in blood sugar.<br /><br />-  Almonds lower cholesterol.<br /><br />-  Almonds contain magnesium.  Magnesium is a calcium channel blocker. Magnesium helps veins and arteries relax, reducing resistance and improving flow of blood, oxygen throughout the body.<br /><br />-  Five large human epidemiological studies, have found that nut consumption is linked to a lower risk for heart disease.

review/summary: Nothing special - except the price
review/text: Oatmeal cookies can be found in pretty much any store, in a variety of brands. So, in order to get my attention it has to be something pretty special. This, is just average, but at a premium price.<br /><br />For starters make sure to pay attention to the box. There are only 6 cookies in a rather large box. Now, flip the box around and look at the ingredients. When I hear oatmeal and almond cookie I expect something at least mildly healthy. To put it frankly the nutrition value of these cookies is lacking.<br /><br />The taste is ok. Nothing really special about it. It didn't seem overly flavorful, but I can't say I disliked them either. The best thing I can say is, it's a good indication of quality if I would get them again. Sadly, I don't see this being my first or second choice when I am looking to buy some cookies. Not even in my top ten if I was being 100% honest.

I generally steer clear of Oatmeal and Nuts in my Cookies (Give me a good old Chocolate Chip Cookie any day!), but these have a very nice Chocolate Chip taste, the Oatmeal taste is there, but it's not overpowering, and the Almonds didn't bother me very much. My only real complaint is in the packaging: The large box only contains 6 moderately-sized Cookies, which are individually-wrapped. The individual wrapping is good if you want to take a Cookie or two on the road with you, but when I saw the box my first thought was "With a box that size, I'd expect more than six Cookies."

review/summary: Tastes Great and packs a punch!
review/text: I was skeptical about Walden Farms products when I first saw them, but a co-worker raved about them so I decided to try a few. I picked up a bottle of the Thick and Spicy at my local grocery store but boy was I surprised when I tasted it. It was great! It has the rich sweet taste you expect in a BBQ sauce (thanks to Splenda) and packs quite a punch. The thick and Spicy is definetly for people who are a fan of spicey hot BBQ sauces.<br /><br />I would definetly recommend this product to anyone who is following the low carb diet or is just watching your calories.<br /><br />I don't often rate things 5 stars, but for zero calories and high on flavor and kick this deserves it.

review/summary: Yum!...
review/text: Yeah, yum.. If you like candied liquid smoke. I've never tried Walden Farm's before but the idea of 0 calorie, scratch that, *TRACE* calories and zero carbs. Wait, there's Splenda and it has half a carb per serving, plus tomato paste which also has carbs and other things on the ingredients that you can't de-carb.<br />Anyways, I digress, the idea of very little calories and very little carbs sounded too good to be true and yep. I drizzled it onto a grilled chicken wrap and bit in. Oh my god. The first thing to hit was a overly sweetness and not a real one, the chemical kind, bletch. The next thing to hit was a smokey taste, and again, not a very good one. It was way too strong and chemical tasting.<br />It ruined my wrap. I should have tasted it separately, but I thought for sure it couldn't be that bad, plus the taste of the Cajun seasonings on the chicken would help hide the taste. I was wrong. By the time I got to the end of the wrap where the liquid fool's gold had collected and bit through, it was way too much. I spit it out and threw the rest away. And all this from a small drizzle down the middle, after all, I was trying it.<br />I couldn't imagine pouring this on something and grilling that nastiness into it.<br />The other reviewers who gave it 5 stars. I don't know what they were thinking. Or maybe Walden Farm's changed the recipe but I didn't get spicy at all in this. It was a bottle of chemically candied chemical smoke flavor.<br />Absolutely horrid. I'd advise staying away unless you like wasting money, not just on this bottle of septic tank juices, but anything it touches. I must now to gargle Listerine and brush.

review/summary: Terrible...And Not Cheap
review/text: I took one sampling of this barbecue sauce after opening the bottle and immediately threw it away.  The taste is really disgusting, nor is the consistency anywhere close to "thick."  Using this product with any type of meat (pork, chicken, beef, etc.) will absolutely ruin what you're eating.  I should have done a better job of reading the other reviews, since they are dead-on.  You can find a number of low-carb barbecue sauce recipes on the web - I'd try that instead of this product.

review/summary: HcG Diet Phase 2 MUST!!!
review/text: I am currently doing the HcG Diet and cannot have anything extra with calories, fat, or sugar.  This barbeque sauce is perfect!!!  I used it last night and WOW! It tastes so good!  It's not thick like traditional bbq sauce, but it is for dieters.  It's sweetened with Sucralose which is an HCG diet no-no, however I didn't stall.  It is tangy, sweet, and barbequey.  I couldn't ask for more.  I have tried Walden Farms Balsamic Vinagrette (which is good), the Honey Dijon (yuck), the Sesame Ginger (so-so), the Ranch (yuck), Peanut Spread (sweet, but not peanut butter tasting), and the Blueberry Jam (good) and I have to say that so far this is the best that they have to offer for dieters.  I don't understand the 1 stars people are leaving (they probably aren't really dieting!).  My coworkers who are also doing the HCG Diet along with me LOVE this bbq sauce, they almost stole my bottle.  I am ordering more now so I don't run out!!!

review/summary: Chemical aftertaste
review/text: Give Walden Farms credit for making a no-carb sauce. It's just a shame it doesn't taste better. Still, I do buy it on occasion and mix it with other tastier sauces to lower the over all carb content. However, the smoke taste is so overwhelming that more than a proportion of 1:4 leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth. This product cannot begin to compare with the taste of the now-defunct Kraft's low-carb barbecue sauce. Mostly, I make my own low-carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste, but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined. However, if you are on an extreme low-carb diet (such as Dr. Bernstein's) this may be the only product that fits.

review/summary: poor service from this company
review/text: When I purchased this sauce to aid in my Atkins diet, it was shown CLEARLY to be a 6 pack.  The title said it, the photo had one of those little text bubbles on it that said "6 pack" and the shipping weight was listed at like 5 pounds or something.  TITLE AS LISTED: "Walden Farms Sauce Barbecue Thick Calorie Free, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)"<br /><br />One (1) bottle arrived, so I called the shipper who said the listing was wrong, and not their fault.  They said Amazon writes the listing (Lies) and to contact them.<br />I called Amazon, they said no, they couldn't possibly be responsible for the misprint on the ad, as they sell millions oof products for tens of thousands of companies, and each company writes their own ads for their own products. (Truth) and that I should make every attempt to resolve the conflict with the seller.<br />After several more "going nowhere" calls with the supplier, they said the only way they would do anything is to submit it for resolution with Amazon, and I'd probably get my money partially refunded.<br /><br />Amazon ended refunding all of my purchase price and shipping.<br /><br />I can't wait to never buy from All Star Health , ever, ever again.  I hope my review inspires you to look elsewhere as well. Bad, poor, lousy, unpleasant, untruthful customer service.<br /><br />By the way, the sauce is good, and I have since found it available in my local CUB Foods grocery store in their diabetic section.

review/summary: An Unexpected Delight!
review/text: The other reviews of the Walden Farms BBQ Sauce made it sound like something you would scrape off the bottom of your shoe, wipe on your meat and promptly barf.  I, however was pleasantly surprised to find the Original Sauce to be very tasty.  The spice level was well balanced with the acidity and sweetness.  No chemical aftertaste of Splenda.  I am a foodie, but my doctor has me on a ridiculously low calorie diet for the next few months.  After the past three weeks, I was desperate for variety and this fit the bill perfectly!  Bare in mind, this is NOT regular barbeque sauce though.  It is thinner, but what would you expect from a no calorie, no carb sauce?  If you are needing variety in your menu, give this a try.  You might just find an unexpected delight!

But taste is completely individual.  It is def. worth a try if you are watching carbs or looking for easy places to cut a few calories from your diet. :)

I season my protein more to kick up the flavor a bit more, but I enjoy it. Its not the best BBQ sauce ever but for not having calories it rocks. I like this the most of all the walden farms stuff I have tried. Look at a grocery store for a price cut; I got mine at Albersons.

I hate to waste things, and I am generally very easy to please.  I won't buy another though because the stuff just doesn't taste like barbecue sauce.  In my opinion, it has nothing to do with the artificial sweeteners either.  Whatever they are doing with the rest of the recipe just isn't getting the job done.<br /><br />If you have NO other choices, maybe you could give it a try yourself.  I do see some others love it, so maybe you would, too.  However, if you have a choice, choose the other brand(s) first before bothering with this.

Also, these are great if you are looking for something with a salty/crunchy characteristic to replace starches like crackers. Instead of croutons, I crunched some of these up and put them in a salad. They go good with soup. When I first ordered these, I thought they'd probably be good. But they exceeded my expectations; they are great.

review/summary: Perfect for the low carb way of life
review/text: These are the answer to anyone who wants to avoid carbs but like to dip or enjoy cheeses on a cracker.  The carb level is less than 1grm for you somersizers that means you aren't combining your proteins and bad carbs.  Hard to find and a little pricey to ship, but worth it.

review/text: I just purchased this product and it was sent to me on thursday.  When I say nasty, cardboard taste, please believe me. I am on a low carb diet and these were just too disgusting for me to digest.  My sister, however loved them and downed them with a glass of riesling. She thinks that they are great! I on the other hand found them to be foul in taste and gritty in texture. Perhaps they would be better suited as a replacement of croutons in a salad.

review/text: These are my favorite cheese crisps. I love the taste and the texture.  But when they arrived, most of them were broken.  They were very well packed with a lot of packing material around the package.  But still they were broken.  I wanted to serve them at a party I was having so I could offer great low carb treats to my friends who don't want carbs. But, too bad, I couldn't serve the broken ones so I had to keep them for myself instead.  Based on taste and yumminess only, I would have given them 5 stars.

review/text: I purchased this product after reading the book "Water and Salt" by Dr. Barbara Hendel. I would highly recommend both the book and the Himalayan crystal salt. I make the salt sole solution by disolving the crystals in Figi water and take a teaspoon of the sole in a glass of the Figi artesian well water each morning when I first get out of bed. It wakes me up and makes my body feel alive! Knowledge is power. Read the book. It is very informative as to the benefits of Himalayan salt verses the adverse effects of regular table salt. It is an eye opener!

review/text: I don't really understand why this coffee is so popular.  I like dark, extra bold roasts such as Black Tiger, Emeril's, and GM Double Black Diamond.  However, this coffee tastes to me much more like a medium roast, has a bitter aftertaste and is not very flavorful. If you like dark roasts, I don't think this will be one of your favorites.  However, it has a lot of positive reviews all over the place.  I ordered it twice from two different sites (Keurig and Amazon) to be really sure that I did not just receive a bad batch, but I will not be ordering it again.

review/text: Totally do not like the flavor of this coffee on it's own. It smells great when you first puncture the k-cup, but then it's all down hill from there.  It's fruity, no nuttiness at all, with a strange aftertaste, and kind of weak on a 6oz brew.  It works fine with a cocoa for a mocha, but not good at all by itself.  This is coming from someone who likes the "Dark Magic" and "Double Black Diamond" k-cups.

review/text: My wife is the coffee drinker in the house and we have tried many BOLD blends over the last couple of years. She found the Tullys Italian Roast to be far too weak even on the lowest Kureg setting. The only one we have found that meets her standards is Timothy's Parisian Nights. If you like a nice bold cup of Joe then she would recomend the Timothy's hands down. Amazon no longer sells the Timothy's by auto shipment so we had to go to the Green Mountain website and get the auto shipment there. Good luck

review/summary: Italian roast - just how i like it
review/text: After years of drink the same old Folgers drip coffee a group of us decided to purchase a Keurig unit for our office.  When any one of us purchase a pack of K-Cups we often share with other so that we can find our favorite, and not spend on those that just are not up to par.  I enjoyed the flavor of the Italian roast, and the people that I shared it with said they did too.  So far, out of the ten or so K-Cup "flavors" that I have tried this is my favorite.  Being that it is a "bold" coffee - I can change the cup volume setting of my Keurig unit to alter the boldness...a larger setting yields a slightly less bold cup, and the smaller cup setting will increase the boldness of the taste.  Of course you can do this with any coffee, this coffee seems to fit the boldness range that i desire.

review/summary: This is "the one"
review/text: I have been taste-testing so many brands and roasts of k-cups to determine our favorites that I feel like a 'lab rat.'  The Tully's Italian Roast immediately stood out from the rest--love at first sip! The other reviews are accurate by describing it as aromatic, smooth and flavorful, not bitter nor weak. I make my first cup of the morning by using one k-cup on the large cup setting, then I make my add'l cups of coffee using one k-cup and a combination of both the middle and smallest cup; that way I get more coffee using one K-cup. It still holds a robust flavor but just not as heavily as the first, which is what I like to do after drinking sev'l cups.  I use cream & sugar, so this routine works for me.  You may or may not tend to tweak your ritual the same way, but it just goes to show you that you can "think out of the k-cup."

It's one of three featured varieties in our office-- Timothy's Breakfast Blend, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast.

review/text: You should stop selling these DEFECTIVE Tully's products!<br /><br />I bought 2 packages of Tully's Italian Roast K-cups (48 cups) on July 20, 2011. I quickly discovered that all were defective. The airtight seal on each and every K-cup was broken and, when put into the Keurig coffeemaker, it spilled coffee grounds into both the coffee and the machine.<br /><br />I contacted Tully's customer service line, explained what'd happened and they couldn't have been more rude, condescending and unhelpful. They refused to send a refund or coupon through Amazon (to eventually credit my account) unless I sent these two boxes back and they inspected them. By the time these were opened a month later, the Amazon packing was long gone and these crappy K-cups were despoiling our pantry. My wife tossed them in disgust.<br /><br />Our first and last purchase from Tully's. Shame on them for such lousy customer service and for failing to stand by their products!.

review/summary: Excellent bold roast!
review/text: This is an excellent bold roast. Perfect for a morning wake-up. I've tried many other K-cups and Tully's is my favorite. Amazon has the best pricing I've found and they ship fast. I will order this again!

review/summary: Prefer Barrista
review/text: This coffee is just ok; personally I prefer Barrista Italian - it's just more robust.  Barrista may cost more, but the flavor is far superior to Tully's.

review/summary: Tully's Italian Roast outdated
review/text: I love Tully's Italian Roast. It is my favorite of all the robust coffees available. I bought this 50 pack and when it arrived there was a note that it was "outdated." I was given the opportunity to return it for a refund, but I don't have time to fool around with returns unless absolutely necessary.  This coffee was good enough to keep, but no where as good as it usually is. The coffee is excellent, but the company from whom I purchased this should have not sent me outdated coffee. Obviously, I will never by from this company. I will, however, continue to buy good Tully's Italian Roast.

review/summary: My favorite k-cup so far
review/text: Agree with other reviewers - if you find other k-cups lacking the strength of flavor and boldness of coffee-house coffee, but french roasts are too strong/bitter/burnt-out for your liking, then you must try this.

review/summary: HUBBY'S FAVORITE
review/text: We have tried MANY of the different flavors of coffee but the ITALIAN ROAST is my Husband's favorite.  May cost a bit more then others but WELL WORTH THE Price.  Give it a try if you like a stronger but NOT oily coffee

review/summary: this is the best coffee I have ever had and it is consistent in its taste
review/text: I've had my Keurig coffee maker for a year and a half and discovered this blend shortly after I got the machine.  It is my everyday coffee now and I cannot find anything to compare.  It is a full, dark roast.  It is similar to Starbuck's Cerona, but richer.

review/summary: A little weak....
review/text: I'm an avid drinker of bold coffees...Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Timothy's Midnight Magic are my two favorites.  I love to sample new flavors.  I tried Tully's Sampler which included Italian Roast, French Roast, Kona and House.  In the sampler package I found the Italian to be the strongest and most flavorful with French Roast a close second. I could get a nice bold flavor with the largest cup setting on my Kuerig.  Recently due to a back order situation on Jet Fuel I ordered Tully's Italian Roast to hold me over until Jet Fuel arrived.  Much to my chagrin I found the 24 count package of Italian Roast produces a much weaker flavor than the one I received in the Sampler Package.  I could still get a bold cup but only using the medium setting on my Keurig.  If you like a bold coffee and have family members who prefer medium roast I'd suggest the sampler rather than 2x24 count Italian Roast.  You'll get House and Kona which are both very medium along with two good strong/bold flavorful brews in the French and Italian.

review/summary: Great coffee - bad customer support
review/text: This is a great coffee.  This is not in its original packaging.  I will assume this is shipped from bulk as the k-cups are thrown into a shipping box.  The order is for 50 pieces.  I counted the k-cups (only due to the way they were packaged) and the order is short 3 pieces.  The contents were only 47 pieces.  I contacted the seller but got no response.  I will update as this evolves.

review/summary: Almost my favorite K Cup
review/text: I still think that the Keurig idea is the best thing for coffee since the grinder. I have had my problems mechanically with the machines but I put up with them because of the good coffee I can get and Keurig does a great job with customer service in my experience. I've been buying Tully's Itailian Roast for quite a while now and love it's full flaver and aroma. In fact I pretty much only buy Tully brand coffee now. I love the Kona blend and that is my favorite right now although I still haven't tried all the ones I'd like to try. It is of course especially good when Amazon puts the Italian Roast on sale because then I really stock up. Try it, you'll like it!!
