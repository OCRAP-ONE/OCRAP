review/summary: Great Value
review/text: I purchased a Keurig single cup brewer for my elderly Mom and with that I sent her a large sample pack.  She pick the Breakfast Blend as her favorite.  This was a great deal so I sent it to her direct.  The K-Cups were all dumped in one box with not much packing protection.  I was sent an email from the company ahead of the delivery so I was aware and all was fine.

review/summary: MY FAVORITE K-CUP!
review/text: Green Mountain Breakfast Blend, is by far my favorite k-cup coffee!!! I was a die-hard Starbucks girl for years, and now that I live in a town without one-I use my Keurig daily. I don't like strong or dark coffees, so this one is nice and mild for me. I also use fat-free, flavored creamers and they taste great with this coffee blend. I also love getting this shipped to me fast on Amazon. The boxes that I found at Walmart, Kohl's, etc... had less kcups in them. I find that ordering them online via Amazon is a great value!

review/summary: Not my favorite Green Mountain
review/text: I don't know if I got a bad batch but this coffee has a nasty plastic flavor. I think the Nantucket Blend is good and the Dark Magic is excellent. My room mate tried it twice and she also thinks the Breakfast Blend is terrible.  Green Mountain makes some very good coffees but in my experience this isn't one of them.

review/text: This is my house's go to breakfast blend coffee.  Not too strong- but not weak we find the flavor very enjoyable and it a nice middle of the road coffee for guests.  My wife likes with cream and sugar but tastes equally at home black.  Doesn't seem to have a ton of pep- I can drink multiple cups in a sitting.  A little planning ahead (2 days with FREE PRIME shipping) and this package is a much better deal than the big boxes or supermakets.  Highly recommended.

review/text: I got some samples of Green Mountain from BzzAgent, and I really liked it and the fact that I can have it pretty much instantly.  Only downside is that when I drink it I don't really feel that kick as if I had a lot of caffeine.  But it's great if you like the taste of coffee just for coffee's sake.

review/text: I received some Green Moutain Coffee K-Cups as a sample test through Buzzagent and I was quite pleased with this.  It's not too strong of a coffee, but not too weak of a coffee either, it has a great blend of flavor.  It has a smooth taste and is not to bitter like some coffees tend to be.  Good price on this brand as well.  Overall I would have to say this a keeper for my morning ritual.

I had been trying in every way imaginable for nearly forty years to accomplish this. However sometimes I feel like something a tad bit lighter for that first cup in the morning. Enter Green Mountain Breakfast Blend. It's exactly what that first cup calls fall. A slightly lighter version of Nantucket Blend, yet it still has the subtle punch you're looking for.

review/text: This particular k-cup has become my favorite and I've had just about all of them from every k-cup maker.  I still enjoy many others, but this one is perfection. I love, love, love it! Funny thing is it took me about a year to try it. Something about the packaging made me think it might be horrible. I was dead wrong. It's perfect. If you're a k-cupper, and there are lots of us now; don't let this one pass you by.

review/text: My wife and oldest son don't like a strong coffee, so the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend works great for them. While I myself prefer the Coffee People's Organic, which is darker and more robust - similar to some of the blends found at Starbucks (not their regular blend). The Organic is strong enough for them to re-use once, after I've had the first brew.<br /><br />I also love that we can get the double pack of the Breakfast Blend 24 K-Cups inexpensively from Amazon. We purchase the Coffee People Organic in the 50-K-cup boxes.

review/summary: Lets rate the flavor shall we. The price will always fluctuate.
review/text: The price of this has been fluctuating forever on amazon. This listing is the same one that different sellers will use. Some are better than others but the reviews stay with the product regardless of who is selling it at the moment. Until it becomes available as a frustration free 50 count box from amazon this is what we will have to deal with. There is another seller that offers free shipping on the 108 count box every once and a while and its free shipping for everyone not only amazon prime members. when you see it available do not hesitate on getting it. It goes fast because of the free shipping. It is still a little high at about 57 cents per cup but 43 is the lowest I have ever seen.<br /><br />This is our favorite everyday coffee. It is what we call "normal" coffee. It's not mild or bold or flavored its just a great medium body cup of joe.<br /><br />When you register your brewer with Keurig. You will be offered some free coffee. I would suggest you get this as your free coffee. You will also be offered free shipping with that order. So buy a lot of the 5 pack samplers and get the most out of the free shipping.

review/summary: Good flavor - a little too weak for me
review/text: Seems like the Keurig systems lend themselves to dark roasts - however, the near burnt flavor element never worked for me. I was excited to try out this light roast (enough for 48 packs of 'trial') - and indeed I loved the flavor if you stick to the small 6 oz cup size. The coffee gets too weak and watery at any of my regular sizes (middle or right-but-one button on the B70) - this is a coffee that could do with an 'extra bold' rating to up the quantity of coffee in the cup.<br />My current alternative for this is Green Mountain's 'Our Blend' - which does seem to have got it right!

review/summary: Thin and lacking flavor
review/text: I got the Keurig as a present recently and have been trying all the samples that came with the unit. I like a smooth tasting coffee with lots of flavor, especially for breakfast. Unfortunately, the Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend left me flat.<br />All of the Keurig K-Cups lack the wonderful aroma that makes coffee drinking so enjoyable, but this breakfast blend is even less aromatic than others.<br />Flavors are, of course, a personal preference, and I can see the appeal of this coffee for some. It doesn't bite you, like many coffees, so if you're looking for a mellow flavor in the morning, this may be for you. Otherwise, steer clear of this one.

review/summary: Poor Labeling makes for a rip-off!
review/text: I have used this before, and like the coffee. But was not aware of the different strengths. Saw a statement about them as I reviewed today (in "product features" it says, "Please note: 'regular', 'bold' and 'extra bold' refer to the amount of coffee in the K-Cup"). There is no way to make any choice during Amazon Prime buying (one click), or any other way i can find. So I am consuming this expensive stuff twice as fast to get the strength I want. Are you listening, Amazon? This proves to me that the arguments some make that buying in the store is better may have merit. if this were not a food item, already opened, I would return.<br /><br />So: WARNING: don't buy unless you are satisfied with any strength (Ironic a product this expensive would not pay more attention).<br /><br />Very, very disappointed!<br /><br />PS, the box labeling did not match the warning anyway, what I got was "Light Roast". The other choice was "Regular". Leads one to wonder if they are clearing off old, outdated product.

The worst part is that you don't know it's instant until you taste it, look carefully at the package, and see that it's "water soluble"-- code words for instant.  Open one up, and you'll see!

I give four stars to the Tully House Blend, but this Breakfast Blend is quite weak.<br />After ordering fifty of them, my husband and I in desperation have been trying to use them up by putting a kcup on espresso setting and using 2-3 kcups on Expresso  as needed to fill up our coffee cup. I'm sure it's a  fine Kcup if you like weak coffee, but...

review/summary: Great Coffee!!
review/text: Excellent coffee for someone who wants a medium roast, mild tasting cup of coffee.  I do not like the dark roast, strong, bitter coffees.  This one is perfect.

review/summary: Good coffee in K Cups
review/text: The only reason I did not give it five stars is the small package (24).  I like to buy in bulk of 108 cups or more in a single box.  Much better price.  Disallowing the smaller package, I must say that the coffee will not disappoint anyone.

review/summary: This is our favorite k-cup coffee!
review/text: We have tried many different types of K-cup coffee flavors and this is the one we keep coming back to.  Neither one of us cares for bitter, strong tasting coffee.  This has a mild, pleasant taste and it never varies from that. Definitely recommend!

review/summary: On the Light Side of Medium Blend Coffees.  Smooth with No Aftertaste.  Typical Breakfast Blend.
review/text: If you like a lighter coffee blend, then this one is a good choice.  It is a breakfast blend, so the flavor will not compete with your food.<br /><br />The blend is smooth, not acidic and doesn't have an aftertaste.  It goes well with cream/sugar.<br /><br />Equal to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002APWQ0K">Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend Medium K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGE6">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Breakfast in Bed (Medium Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.

review/summary: Just Right for Me
review/text: I recently found this blend available at my local Walmart (sorry Amazon, but it had a great price). It is a light blend such as I prefer, and tastes wonderful.  I could not detect any aftertaste as you get with medium or dark coffee blends. I previously wrote a review for Green Mountain's Nantucket Blend which I recommended to those that prefer medium blends.  However, this particular blend is just right for me.  I highly recommend this blend to fellow Amazon customers that prefer light blends.

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: I had received a Keurig coffee maker for the holidays and have been hooked since. I am not a real strong coffee person so this morning blend is perfect. Consistant in flavor. The only reason I gave it a four is once you buy the machine you are basically locked into buying the cups.. It does have the reusable pod tho. I believe the prices could come down. In the store the prices are outrageous, but on Amazom they are reasonable somewhat..

review/text: My favorite to use in my Keurig. The Breakfast Blend is not too strong, but it isn't so weak that I can't taste the coffee after adding creamer. I do not like a dark roast, but I also don't like an incredibly weak roast. This blend is absolutely perfect for those who like a coffee that is just right. :)

review/summary: Good everyday coffee
review/text: I have usually ordered my K-Cups direct from Green Mountain, but thought I'd try Amazon's larger package and subscribe/save. The box of 50 works out to about a month's supply of coffee for me, with drinking a couple of cups a day.<br /><br />The taste is good--it's not a strong coffee, for that you need something like Green Mountain Coffee's Extra Bold.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PA30ZU">Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic (Extra Bold) K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers, 50-count</a><br /><br />It's not too heavy of a coffee, but none of the cups I have brewed have been the weak water that a few other reviews suffered from. Bad batches and bad quality control may be the issue.<br /><br />If you double-check the prices and get a good batch, it's a better than average cup of coffee.

review/text: This is a mild coffee which I really like.  I don't care for a really dark blend as it tends to be bitter, but this breakfast blend is quite good.  I have had a few other blends and I may change and get the columbia blend some time but the breakfast blend is not bitter and so far I like it the very best.  It has a pleasing taste and aroma.

review/summary: Cups different
review/text: Having lots of problems with Green Mountain cups. Coffee is fine, but plastic seems heavier than other brands and does not fully drain into cup, but drips considerably when removing to dispose. Will probably choose other brands in the future instead. Have been using K-Cups for over a year and only have had problems with this brand.

review/summary: Best K-Cup coffee for me!
review/text: I love this coffee.  I'm a fan of lighter roasts.  I like the lack of bitterness and higher caffeine that comes with them.  This one is my favorite.  For most K-Cups, even lighter roasts, I have to run the machine twice through one K-Cup to get a decent, not overly-strong, cup of coffee.  These come out perfect for me with one run.  I do tend to go through them more quickly because of that, but that's okay. The great coffee is worth it!
