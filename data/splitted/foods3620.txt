review/summary: Best Store Brand Green Mole
review/text: This is the best green mole sauce by far, I refuse to buy other brands because they don't come as close as this sauce in terms of flavors.  Very easy to make, just add some chicken broth, a pinch of sugar, a pinch of salt.  While the suace is okay with chicken, pork really shines here.  The sauce has peppers, pumpkin seeds, etc... these subtle smoky flavors pair well with an inexpensive pork steak, a side of black beans, and plain white rice (Mexican).  Also, feel free to add diced potatoes during the last few minutes of cooking for an even more filling/substantial meal.

review/summary: Hemp Super Food...
review/text: Manitoba sells the 5lb container with bigger saving but it all depends how much you consume. I consume these straight from the container with spoon, an hour before my work outs without mixing in a bowl or as dressing. I consume it first thing in the morning or when I need a quick burst of energy regardless of the time of the day. For years I have consumed 1)raw sunflower seeds, 2)almonds in water 3)organic sesame+flax seeds grinded in coffee maker + cocoa powder + unflavoured protein isolate on daily basis and now I have added hemp to my diet. Seeds all go rancid due to the oil and the germ inside the seed so regardless of the type or brand, seeds need to be stored in freezer, in a dark, cold, sealed container, away from any moisture. If plastic container it needs to be #5 or much safer in glass containers. I consume seeds within two weeks but the hemp seeds within the most three months since I can not get it in small quantities and it will lose its nutritional value. Organic is better but these are good as well and priced very reasonably. This is an unbelievable product and you can not grow it in US since it is illegal and big business does not want to see you healthy and there is no profit in hemp for since it is so cheap to grow with so many benefits that scares big pharma, plastic industry, fabric-cotton industry, pesticide producers, etc... so if you live in US, Canada becomes your only hope. Hemp increases my level of energy without an other artificial stimulants like caffeine and sugar. More energy with less empty calorie fillers, like sugar and saturated fat, and common energy bars. Contains the highest percentage of globulin than any other plant which is an essential amino acid that helps my body to create antibodies, a component of a healthy immune system. Healthy addition to a weight loss plan since it provides essential nutrients such as protein, essential fatty acids, fibre, vitamins and minerals without adding an excess amount of calories, starch and sugar. One of the best natural boosters that I can get when doing all different type of sports or when I need energy without a big meal. Hemp is truly a good plant for the environment and it is shame that we have to deal with the politics of the hemp instead of the benefits of the hemp in US. Victim of its own success. This is a super food next to quinoa, kale, broccoli, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc... Thank you Canada.

They're easier to handle than sunflower seeds or pistachios that require some work to enjoy. These hemp seeds blend in well with recipes. The Blossoming Lotus Cafe (in Portland,Oregon) and Cafe Gratitude (San Francisco,Berkeley,San Rafael,Healdsburg) use hemp seed as part of their entrees and sweets. Enjoy!

Who knew you could eat hemp seeds like this, this is a amazing food and is really healthy for you too! This company has wide variety to choose from. I like how  this company does the re seal bags so they dont have to go into another bag.

review/summary: NOT ORGANIC!
review/text: From Manitoba Harvest: Cross contamination can occur in pesticide free (non organic grown seed) as wind blow or sharing of trucks, equipment or storage bins can occur. For peace of mind buy certified organic as farmers pay attention to detail, don't share equipment or bins, and are monitored strictly so they are paid a higher prices per pound. There's a difference in what kind of fertilizer is used on the land. Our organic seeds come from certified organic land which uses alfalfa as fertilizer, while our pesticide-free seed farmers have the option of using a synthetic topical on the soil, very much the same as liquid plant food you can buy for your house. This synthetic topical is man-made and not organic, which is why our Pesticide-Free product line cannot be certified organic.<br /><br />Also the tubs are gigantic which makes storing a pain. I've gotten a couple of tubs that needed to be cut open because it wasn't perforated and they couldn't be resealed which also was a problem because the product couldn't stay fresh. They need to stick with the resealable bags and jars rather than these tubs. Cheap is not always worth it that's for sure. I'll stick to true organic in bags that take up little space.

review/summary: Oh my goodness, this tea...
review/text: Cranberry. Cranberry is another one of those flavors that brings out very distinct memories for me. Thanksgiving at my grandmother's house, not for the cranberry sauce (which I loathe), but for the cranberry juice she always had on hand. I loved it! And she'd mix it with a bit of ginger ale for me and oh, I felt so grown up...my first cocktail! Virgin, of course. We lost her the year I started college, so every time I taste anything with cranberry, I think of her. Then growing up, my mom taught me how to make this delicious cranberry-orange bread with fresh cranberries, and that bread is why I always have cranberries in my freezer. I made it for my in-laws the first Christmas after the wedding and now they look forward to it every year. Maybe after I've tried this straight I'll need to try it with some orange juice. But cranberry is a flavor very near and dear to my heart, so I am very much looking forward to trying this one. The health benefits of cranberries aren't such a bad thing either, and since I don't drink juice anymore, this might be a good way for me to get them.<br /><br />This blew my socks off. The scent when the package is opened is a sweet cranberry, not the tart berry I was looking for, but I can't bring myself to complain. I put about a quarter of a teaspoon in a small mug, added about 75-80 C water, some sugar, and frothed it up. Then I added robots (by which I mean ice in the shape of robots) and a touch of cold water to make a beautiful iced tea. I am so far from disappointed it hurts. This is lovely. I didn't expect to like this one nearly as much as I do, but I am in love. I'm definitely seeing the berry in cranberry, but there's also a hint of tartness in the middle of the sip. I am so surprised, I honestly didn't expect to be wowed by this. But I am and I am going to restock on it ASAP. I can't wait to try it blended with some vanilla matcha or some orange juice...yum. I don't have a lot of experience with cranberry outside of the little fruits baked into muffins, but I think I need to branch out and try some new things!

review/text: When my husband was in the hospital for a sleep study, I discovered these delicious little demons on the gift shop. Let's just say the shop owner got to know me WELL because I kept going back for "just one more". These are made of fabulous, soft, perfect red licorice wrapped around what is best described as a "pencil" of firm, white chocolate. Soft fruitiness and the "snap" of creamy chocolate. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Being able to buy them by the box COULD be a very, very BAD (because they are so good) thing! Glad to know my favorite online store-Amazon-carries them.

While, for the most part, these are very hot peppers, about 20% in each bag aren't hot at all - in fact they register lower than a jalapeno in heat.  Again, I don't know all the particulars, but it seems to me I'm getting some duds.  Maybe this is a common thing - someone with more experience would have to tell me.  For the most part, I enjoyed this product, save for the few peppers that didn't bring the heat.

review/summary: The real deal....smoky flavor noticeable but not too strong
review/text: The heat of the peppers varies dramatically between peppers and between different parts of the pepper.  The hottest part is the white part next to the seeds while the red shell is less so.  After gifting some peppers to some friends at the office I removed the stems and ground the remainder - basically filling a baby food jar. Smoky flavor - I assume they dried over coals.  I tried germinating some seeds - no luck, the heat from drying probably killed the seeds.

The label says:  "Made in a facility that processes Tree Nuts and Soy, but DOES NOT process any Peanuts, Gluten, Dairy, Cholesterol, or GMO's."  I also have a problem with Soy and I don't usually buy products if the label says "may contain soy" or "facility also processes soy", but I trust the Artisana brand and decided to try it.  I've never had a problem with - except for wanting to eat too much of it!  Plus its raw and organic too.  It has a nice consistency, and you don't have to refrigerate this (although you may need to if you don't eat it up as fast as we do).  Its a pricy product, but a "clean" one and Amazon's price is similar to what I've seen locally and online.

review/summary: THE best gluten-free cookie!
review/text: I've found the holy grail of gluten-free cookies!! This shortbread is simply PERFECT: wonderfully light, crispy, and buttery; flavored just right; not too sweet--and I can eat it despite my numerous dietary restrictions! In fact, it's easy to forget that these wonders are gluten- , egg- dairy-, corn- and transfat-free, because they just taste like a really well-made cookie (which they are) and not like some substitute-laden excuse for a cookie (which I'm sure you've endured if you have these dietary restrictions). I've also tried Sun Flour Baking Co.'s lemon shortbread (also sold here), and it is equally as satisfying. Maybe the "lots of love" listed in the ingredients is what doing the culinary trick here, but whatever SFBC is doing, I hope they keep it up for a very long time! I am hooked!

It kinda sounds like it would be weird but it taste like ketchup, just with the flavor kicked up.  Very good.  It is not overly hot.  it was not too hot for my wife.  She doesn't like stuff as hot as I do and she liked it as well.  You can't go wrong with this.  Great on hamburgers or in meatloaf.

My tastes for food and drink, however,remain in the NYC area and, when it comes to Italian food and drink, Little Italy is still a jewel--it may be "touristy" but it is still the real deal. I have had a quest for that perfect espresso bean to use in my espresso machine and a recent trip to NYC and a visit to Ferraras and that taste of their espresso just renewed my quest. I purchased the subject product and it is everything I want in espresso---nutty, sweet, with that distinguished espresso flavor, smell, and brilliance. At around $10 per pound, it is the perfect bargain for my afternoon and evening taste buds.

review/summary: Whiskas Indoor cat food
review/text: I previously bought this product at my local grocery store. My cats loved it!! I have always bought Whiskas brand dry cat food, (chicken and turkey flavor). The first time I bought this item I bought 1 bag, the following week I went back and they had 3 bags on the shelve, I purchased 2 bags. I went back the next week and they had none left. I had inquired about when they would be getting more in, and I was told they were not getting any more. I have been searching to find more of the Whiskas indoor dry cat food and had no luck. Until I finally found it on Amazon. I was so happy!!! and so were my 5 cats. I even went as far as calling the Mars company who makes the Whiskas cat dry cat food and they couldn't help me.<br />I sure hope Amazon gets more of this in stock, because I know I will be sure to buy more. When my cats are happy, so am I.  :-)

review/summary: puzzled
review/text: My three young cats are only happy with Whiskas Indoor cat food, so I felt safe ordering the 6 pound bag on line.  Sadly they will not eat the food that was shipped. They cry and looked up at me with hungry eyes. So I have purchased a new bag locally and they are happy cats again. I have no clue why they will not eat it other than it 'MAY' be stale.  It did not sit on my doorstep, I accepted the package immediately on delivery  The only difference I can see is that the local bag is a 3 pound bag, and the 'best by date' is three months later.  I am considering mixing small amounts of the 6lb bag slowly with the 3 pound bag. If that doesn't work I will give it to the local cat shelter.<br /><br />Had they liked it, I would have continued ordering it on line because of the convenience of having it delivered to my door.  It was delivered a day earlier than promised and it was packaged very well. There was no cost savings.

I'm happy that I found an online source.<br /><br />Also, I have a cat that has a sensitive stomach and pukes up a lot of food but he seems to do well with the Whiskas. Again, Whiskas, bigger bags!

review/summary: Convenience and a competitive price
review/text: I get tire of running to the store to get supplies for my cats, especially since I live 20 miles away from the nearest Walmart and sometimes the winters are not the best. I did a lot of looking around for cat food that I could have delivered that would be appropriate for my cats, and either the same price as it would be at the store (or hopefully cheaper). I am spending the same amount of money that I was before, only I don't have to worry about running out and having to buy an overpriced bag of cat food (often not the brand we normally use) at the grocery store in my small town due to bad roads keeping me from running to Walmart. Both cats love the food, and beg for it when their bowl is empty.  I like knowing that I won't run out so easily , and have the convenience of having it delivered to me.  I did the same with cat treats (subscribe and save), now if only I could find kitty litter that I prefer to use that was affordable to have shipped, but no luck there so far. I keep hoping that Amazon will get more subscribe and save products. I check often (crossing my fingers for the kitty litter that I normally use to show up at a good subscribe and save price)

review/summary: Long-lasting flavor in a xylitol gum
review/text: I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Cinnamon is by far my favorite. The flavor lasts for longer than any of the other Spry flavors. The warming effect of cinnamon oil also offsets the cooling effect of xylitol, making it not feel as strange in the mouth.<br /><br />I really like that the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. It's great that I can chew this without having intestinal problems.

review/summary: Yummy way to save your teeth
review/text: Let's face it.  No one wants to get bad news from the dentist.  Proper dental care can go a long way to keeping one's teeth for a lifetime.<br /><br />The generation that grew up in the Depression and World War II many times did not have good dental care.  No fluoride, sealants, waterpiks, sonic toothbrushes and the like.  It wasn't uncommon for a person in their 30s to be missing a few teeth.  People generally could look forward to wearing dentures as their teeth became so rotten, the only thing to do was to pull them.<br /><br />Today, we don't have such problems.  And one of the reasons is the use of xylitol to help kill the bacteria that cause tooth decay.  The main reason for dental decay is a bacterium called S. Mutans.  This bug feeds on sugars and starches, secreting acids which destroy tooth enamel, which leads to decay and cavities.  There are various ways to defeat this bug, brushing, fluoride, flossing and sealants all have their place.<br /><br />A more modern addition to the decay-preventing fight is xylitol.  It's a sugar alcohol that S. Mutans cannot digest.  Sucking on mints or chewing gum with xylitol a few times a day is a easy and tasty way to curb this nasty bacteria.<br /><br />I've been chewing xylitol gum and eating xylitol mints for a number of years, and I've noticed that my dental problems have really improved.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  My only complaint is that this gum is so delicious, I tend not to ration it to make it last longer.  Try Spry.  Your mouth will thank you for it.  (Maybe not your dentist, though).

review/summary: Everything from China
review/text: Personally, I have read too much and heard too many news reports about the lack of valid oversight in China when it comes to the health and safety of their products and ingredients (from medicines to food to children's toys...) for me to be comfortable with their products. This is a personal decision because for me, health is paramount in life.<br /><br />Here is part of an email I received from Xlear about their products in answer to my questions about the origin of their products:<br /><br />"Good Afternoon,<br /><br />The raw Xylitol comes from China, shipped to Orem, UT and that is where we make the Xlear Nasal Spray.  Our Gum, Mints and Candies are all made in China. The rest of our products are made here in the states.  I hope that was the information you were looking for. Have a nice day!<br /><br />Xlear Inc."<br /><br />I find this especially troubling because the nasal spray has a big red, white and blue shield that says "Made in the USA." So all the ingredients come from China and are put together in Utah. Can this really be legal? To say "Made in the USA" when all the ingredients are from China?<br /><br />If it is 'legal' to say this (yes, we have big problems with our own FDA)...it is still unethical in my opinion. Deceptive, misleading. Sigh...American business and politics. Maybe we should all just move to China. And get jobs in their factories.

review/summary: Good for what I needed, but the flavor does not last
review/text: I wanted this gum because studies have shown xylitol reduces tooth decay (see Wikipedia quote below).  I put this in my kids' lunch, because they have had some issues with cavities, and despite my begging that they brush at lunch, I am very sure they are not.  I take this gum also, and I chew it after my lunch.  I know my kids will chew this, even if the flavor doesn't last long, because it's gum- and all gum is better than no gum.  On the negatives side, if you are looking for a gum that stays soft and chewy and flavorful for a long time, this isn't it.  I like the flavor- it's not bitter like some cinnamon gums, but I can't say it lasts long.  I chew it, feel it freshens my breath and may help my teeth, and the pretty quickly, when it starts to taste like unflavored rubber, I spit it out.<br /><br />what follows is from wiki:<br /><br />Xylitol is a "toothfriendly" sugar. In addition to not encouraging tooth decay (by replacing dietary sugars), xylitol may actively aid in repairing minor cavities caused by dental caries.[citation needed] Early studies from Finland in the 1970s found that a group chewing sucrose gum had 2.92 decayed, missing, or filled (dmf) teeth compared to 1.04 in the group chewing xylitol gums. In another study, researchers had mothers chew xylitol gum 3 months after delivery until their children were 2 years old. The researchers found that the xylitol group had "a 70% reduction in caries (dmf)." Recent research confirms a plaque-reducing effect and suggests that the compound, having some chemical properties similar to sucrose, attracts and then "starves" harmful micro-organisms, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption. (However, this same effect also interferes with yeast micro-organisms and others, so xylitol is inappropriate for making yeast-based bread, for instance.)<br /><br />Xylitol based products are allowed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make the medical claim that they do not promote dental caries.[9]

The cinnamon flavor is amazing initially, but, as I said, the flavor lasts so briefly it is not worth it at all. If you are just getting this because you want to chew on something, go ahead and buy this, but don't expect flavor.

review/summary: No flavor
review/text: I was so disappointed with the flavor (or lack thereof) that I threw out the remaining pieces. I only tried a few but I just couldn't love it. The cinnamon flavor wasn't strong at all and after a few minutes I felt like I was just chewing rubber. I like gum to give me a 'fresher' feel and this didn't help at all. I will never order again, no matter the price. My order was a complete waste of money.

review/summary: Tastes good, for 10 seconds
review/text: I decided to give Spry Cinnamon a chance, reading mostly positives reviews about it. When I first popped a piece in, it tasted great! However, and I am not exaggerating, the flavor was gone in 10 seconds . . . I have never had a gum that the flavor went out so fast in. And like others have said, the gum does turn a little hard and nasty within a minute. I like the idea of it being all natural and helping your teeth, but it's not worth it to me.

review/text: This gum is nice and cheap, but it's not really that great. Overall even though it's cheap it's not worth it in my opinion. The flavor is alright but is gone in less than a minute and the gum becomes hard and difficult to chew almost immediately. I also bought the 600ct fruit flavor of this same brand and that was better, the flavor lasted longer and the gum stayed soft for a reasonable length of time.

review/summary: Good Stuff! Make Sure You Keep Away From Dogs!
review/text: This has amazing taste! Even though there have been double blind studies showing it reduces cavities xylitol is controversial. I chew it because I have low saliva production. Ten minutes every hour, ten hours a day increases saliva production, which protects gums and teeth. It is thought that mouth bacteria can't ferment it, which is the reason it reduces cavities.<br /><br />Xylitol to dogs is deadly, so I am very careful to keep Xlear Spry gum where they can NEVER get to it, and disposing the used gum into the trash out in the garage. In dogs, Xylitol is toxic. Just 3 grams can kill a 65 pound dog. In about 30 minutes (give or take) of a dog eating something containing xylitol, their blood sugar begins droping to dangerous levels. Symptoms are weakness, lethargy, loss of coordination, collapse and seizures. An IMMEDIATE trip to the vet is needed, otherwise there is little chance your dog will survive. This doesn't affect cats.<br /><br />Another thing to consider with xylitol, is that it does thin the blood in humans. People on blood thinners, such as myself should consult their doctors before consuming Xlear Spry or any xylitol containing items.<br /><br />That said, Xlear Spry gum is really good, I especially like the cinnamon flavor. I love the flavor! Also, there are no Phenylketonurics (known cancer causing ingredients) in Spry.

review/text: I love cinnamon gum.  It is like dessert to me.  I was excited to try some gum made with real cinnamon oil.  My other "go to" brand has every type of "tol"(manitol, sorbitol etc.) sweetener made and that scares me just a little.  This has a nice peppery, cinnamon flavor to start but only lasts a few minutes.  Maybe this is the true cost of a natural flavoring?  My "go to" brand lasts and lasts but is probably killing me on the inside.  The quest for a true cinnamon gum continues.

It does lose it's flavor, but not much more quickly than some other gums.  I usually chew two peices at a time as they are a bit small. The Spry mints are also good.

review/summary: nice but could be improved
review/text: Being a guy that chews gum everyday i was looking for a healthier alternative to my usual ''dentyne ice'' those small rectangular hard pieces of gum.  I found spry and thought i hit the jackpot.  When you open the container , first thing you will notice are the gum pieces are much smaller than dentyne ice , then when you first try it the flavor is very nice like a milder version of ''big red'', but thats where it stops, the flavor is sucked out of it in about 20 seconds and you will need to pop about 3 of these just to feel like you are chewing on something.  My suggestion is make them about 1/3 bigger and do something to make the flavor last a bit longer.  They're supposedly good for your teeth so ill use up my order and possibly order them again if i dont find a better version of this gum.

review/text: This gum is good, however, the flavor does not last long. This is not a problem as there are 100 pieces BUT, and I warn you, be cautious when consuming more than a few pieces in a day. You could be in for an eventful surprise. The sugar substitutes that end in "ol" (like "Xylitol") are sugar alcohols and these can pull liquid into the bowel and cause diarrhea and other digestive upsets. Google for more information or try for yourself!

review/text: I am trying to avoid aspartame in my diet, but most sugar-free gum contains it. This gum uses only Xylitol as the sweetener.  It is very strong at first (I purchased cinnamon flavor), but the flavor subsides quickly.  If you keep it in your mouth though, you begin to taste it again.  Maybe the initial strength deadens the taste buds temporarily. One upside is that it isn't nearly as sticky or soft as other gums, so it doesn't make a mess trying to throw it away.  Make sure you keep it away from pets, because Xylitol is toxic for dogs.

review/summary: Healthy Chewing Gum with Good Flavor
review/text: Since I was a kid, I have loved chewing sugarless gum. I have read that it is a good habit, as it helps clean your teeth after meals and prevent cavities, and may even help prevent acid reflux. Chewing cinnamon gum has even been shown to boost mental performance in a study. However, I became concerned about the possible heath risks from artificial sweeteners like potassium acesulfame used in the gum available at local stores, so I was chewing less often. I decided to try this Xlear Spry cinnamon gum, sweetened with Xylitol. According to Wikipedeia, xylitol has a lot of heath benefits, including reducing dental caries, ear and upper respiratory infections, and Candida yeast growth; it also helps remineralize teeth and bones.  I am happy with Spry cinnamon gum as a substitute for the name-brand gums I had bought previously, though it isn't perfect.  I do have to chew two pieces, as the gum seems to shrink over time, and the flavor is pleasant but doesn't seem to be quite as strong or last as long.  Also the cost of Spry is higher, since I can't take advantage of sales and coupons like with other gum.  These are minor complaints, though, and I am happily switching my family to healthier xylitol-based gum.
