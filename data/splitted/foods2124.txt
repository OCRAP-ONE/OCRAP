review/summary: Both My Kids Love Them!
review/text: Both of my children love these chips - ages 7 and 5. I love them too -- the way they taste and how healthy they are. The second ingredient is almonds. This gives it 3 grams of protein per serving. Gotta love that! I feel good giving this to them as a snack for school.

review/text: These chips taste great, and are quite addictive. It can easily consume an entire bag in one sitting if I'm not careful. Reminds me of Doritos Nacho Cheese chips too! I think this flavor is better than the plain sea salt variety, and the price at Amazon for the group of 6 is a good buy compared to what I'd pay in my region.

review/summary: Finally, good Stroopwafels!
review/text: I have bought this product from various vendors on Amazon, but the only ones that have been good ... and fresh ... and NOT broken and crumbling are these from Coffeecakes. We love this Dutch treat, but the quality can vary tremendously.  I can put one atop my cup of hot tea (or for 30 sec in the microwave) and it warms and melts the caramel and I have a terrific treat.<br /><br />I caution anyone buying this, the quality can vary enormously. I know because I have bought from different places. But, now that I know better, I will make sure mine are from Coffeecakes.<br /><br />No, I am not Dutch, but I know a unique treat when I eat it.

review/text: These Stroopwafels were absolutely delicious and arrived intact! My husband made an instant request to order more and  I will be doing just  that. These lovely cookies are perfect with coffee or English Tea. If your cup is the perfect size to let the Stroopwafle sit on the rim of your coffee mug or tea cup, let it sit on top of it for two minutes for each side. This allows the caramel in the middle to melt just enough to give you a delightful mouthful when you take a bite. Don't leave it on too long other wise the cookie will soften and fall in your cup. Makes a great gift for coffee and tea  lovers. Order some and enjoy!

It did seem to taste slightly raisiny so my best guess is maybe they used ground up raisins? There are raisins on the ingrediaent list.At best this is just a cinnamon bread.<br />The search goes on.<br />Ps I can't get over the disconnect between my expercience and the other reviews.. maybe I got a bad box.

review/summary: Balance of Sweet, Tart and a Hint of Spice
review/text: Alpine Spiced Cider is a great instant cider blend. Many quick, powdered drinks are one-note, but this one isn't. It manages to be both sweet and tart like real apple cider, and has just a hint of cinnamon and mulled spice in the background. During long, cold winters, it's so nice to have a fast treat like this cider to help warm you up inside.<br /><br />Because these have a good amount of Vitamin C, they are also excellent for the inevitable winter colds. On those horrible days when even opening and heating a can of chicken soup seems too hard, all you have to do is switch your electric kettle to on, dump the packet into a cup and you're good to go. Maybe a cup of apple cider a day can even keep the doctor away, who knows?<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the Alpine Spiced Cider Drink Mixes as a quick and easy way to enjoy a hot beverage. It won't be as authentic as homemade cider, but it won't be a hassle to prepare either.<br /><br />Note: You can also find these at national chain warehouse stores for a reasonable price, but because they're considered a seasonal item, be aware that you will have the best luck (and best deals) during fall and winter.

review/summary: Good Coffee
review/text: I tried several kinds of coffee at the local store and hated them, so I did some research and decided to give this one a try.  It's got a mild nutty, earthy flavor without the burnt coffee taste of a dark roast (that's what a dark roast is--burnt coffee).  It is good on its own, but would be especially good as a base if you plan to mix beans.  Being a Sumatra, it is easier on the digestion than most other kinds of coffee (I noticed a difference), although if you really have acid indigestion problems the dark roast is supposed to be the best.  The beans have a pleasant aroma and are nice and shiny.  The bag is actually quite large - about 12"X8"X6" - so plan on it taking up some refrigerator or freezer space.  Overall, I would recommend this coffee, and because the bag is so large I will be sharing some with my sister.

review/text: Sumatra coffee beans have been my favorite for many years now, and I have tried Sumatra coffees from several different organic, fair trade companies. So far, this Sumatra has been my favorite. (Granted, I prefer medium roasts over dark roasts.) It's just as good in flavor, if not a little better, than Green Mountain's Sumatra Special Reserve, but Green Mountain's is quite a bit more expensive (they don't sell bulk bags of whole beans). And like any coffee I'm willing to buy, the company has an explicit mission to uphold organic farming and fair trade practices. If you like Sumatra, this is the way to go!<br /><br />EDIT: Wow. The price on this bag has doubled since I bought it. I paid $44 for this five pound bag when I purchased it. I'm not sure why the price has suddenly doubled. At this rate you may as well buy the Green Mountain. I'm taking one star off my review.

review/summary: Sets the bar in dog food, most are not human-grade and most are highly processed
review/text: I spent 5 years studying canine nutrition and sadly, learned that vets don't ever get this chance. Veterinary colleges are funded by dog food companies and unfortunately, as one famous vet who wants to change all that, Dr. Pitcairn, realized, taught to treat the problem rather than discovering what's causing it and that usually relates to the diet. In fact, a tremendous increase in dog health issues can be traced back to the time that dog food companies started...when they stopped eating table scraps and began an all-processed high grain and high allergen and unnatural diet. Even though table scraps were full of dog toxins like onions, they STILL had less health issues than their process food preservative and poor balance counterparts of today.<br /><br />Funny how we wouldn't feed our kids crackers every day but feel it's okay to only feed our dogs that--high grain, poor protein, cooked out vitamins, highly processed, low nutrients...dogs who, in nature, seek out more protein.<br /><br />In fact, that is how new dog food nutrition studies began. Because vets realized that wolves and coyotes in the wild brought in for treatment if hit by a car, etc do not have the health issues our INDOOR dogs have. A wolf might be old and without fleas or tartar or itching and with a glossy coat.<br /><br />So vets like Dr. Pitcairn began studying the cause of pets with chronic issues or developing common issues too young and finding what things were toxic and unnatural and what helped prevent poor things in their diet.<br /><br />I live in the woods and have 3 dogs and have yet to have one flea because I follow this advice. In fact, I have strangers tell me (often) that my dog's fur looks like a cat's because it's so shiny. No itching. Never grew up begging for my food because theirs is complete. (It may be hard to break this habit once begun but easy if it never starts.)<br /><br />I will only feed them 3 things: a diet I make from Dr. Pitcairn's recommendations, ( I have no ties to any of these but am an activist about sharing anything good or bad for pets)  Newman's Own canned dog food, or Flint River Ranch.<br />Why? First of all, as part of my own studies I visited dog food plants. Actually this was like the biggest wakeup call on the planet for me.  I watched as I was told the "brilliant" model of putting the factories near cattle processing. When a cow is dead or dying of anything...they never determine the cause...they pick it up in a bulldozer and go take it to the dogfood plant. I WATCHED this.<br /><br />How can they do this? Do you see how you rarely see the term "human grade meat" on dog food? They don't have to be inspected if it's dog food. There are two different levels of acceptance...people cannot eat food riddled with tumors from lesions or cancer, it's okay if dog's do. According to the government regulations.  Humans are required to eat inspected meat of certain cleanliness standards and from cows processed for this reason (I don't eat meat anyway but still....)Dog food companies are not required to have such standards.<br /><br />For reals.<br /><br />So if you will recall the huge outbreak of botulism a few years back with sick dogs going to vets, dying, etc that they linked to dog foods then it happened a few months later...do you remember there were only about 5 companies that were labeled as unaffected? This was one, Newman's Own was one....why? They only use HUMAN GRADE meat. Their meat is inspected. They do not buy meat from downed cattle plants so they were released from any recall or report of possible affected products. The others bought meat from across the country at these places and it was found the cows were diseased but because they never have to check to find out what they cows died from when making them into food, it was passed along. Then it happened again a few months later. Then it happened again a year later. Yes, we hear about these things when dogs die en masse. We never, however, hear about dogs that just fall ill....<br /><br />But it gets worse.  You may see a list of vitamins and nutrients across the back of a bag of dog food. But due to the way meat is processed, they bake it at astronomically high temps to try to kill off any lesions, puss, etc. I"m not making this up. But they ARE required to have these in there...so what happens? They all bake off. You are left with some grains, high allergens like corn, and you are basically feeding your dog crackers and by-products of downed cattle.<br /><br />So, does your dog beg and salivate when you eat meat or any dinner for that matter? Does your dog dive into the grass to try to get greens and nutrients by eating grass when you go for a walk?<br /><br />There is a reason.  In nature, if you gave a human baby a banana and a bunny they would pet the bunny and eat the banana. If you gave a hungry dog the same for dinner, they'd eat the bunny first. What part of the bunny do they eat first? the stomach.  Why? This is where they get their greens and nutrients...then the meat protein. The raw bones clean their teeth without splintering.<br /><br />Yet, although we are against eating an all-processed diet, dogs in spite of begging and pleading, are now living shorter lives, with the highest health issues ever due to our thinking that it's better for them because a dog food company told us so...or vets who don't have classes in nutrition tell us so. But this isn't taught in veterinary schools and dog food companies fund and provide text books etc. I didn't say this...vets say this.<br /><br />That is changing. There is a huge off-shoot of vets now learning to find the issue and the cause (usually food related) rather than treating the issue alone.  And it turns out most issues are cured by a proper diet.<br /><br />In fact, look at your dog treats. If you see sugar in them you will realize how many dog food companies are motivated by money. And there are lots of dog treats even TARTAR CLEANING (they say) dog treats with sugar. Why? Your dog will crave them just like people do. You may also see loads of unnnatural ingredients and even toxins such as onion powder. Milo's dog treats have these. Your dog can't tell you what is slowly hurting their kidneys. It's up to you to read the labels. Dog food is not regulated. It's up to us to do that.<br /><br />The first thing you will notice about this dog food is that it looks like cookies broken a part rather than machine-made little round circles. Why? Because it it. They use inspected human-grade meat and a balance of carbs, protein, etc. that is closer to the natural diet and what a dog needs. Then they can bake it at a regular temperature that doesn't bake these out, just like you would at home. The nutrients aren't baked out. They bake it in sheets, naturally, then just break them apart.<br /><br />You may be skeptical...so give it a month or two. Take a picture of your dog's fur before (dead serious) then compare it to when it has time to grow after eating this....you will be SHOCKED. We show poor health in our hair and so do they.<br /><br />I can actually walk up to people at a dog event and tell them what they feed their dog. I have yet to be wrong and I do it often. I don't mean what brand but even people who think they are feeding their dog premium food like Iams have no idea it's just processed crackers marked up and grains and downed cattle.<br /><br />I actually point out to people the difference. I kid you not, a family barbecue, a neighborhood "house crawl", a restaurant that allows dogs outside....I can walk up and tell who gives their dog table scraps (without toxins like onions or avocados) or real food, or human grade food....I just say "what do you feed your dog?" and I've never been wrong. Their coats are SHOCKINGLY different and shinier, the dogs aren't itching, and they usually have better teeth and gums.  I have yet to be wrong.<br /><br />One lady told me how she took her dog to vets for years and it had to have steroid shots, then she finally found a vet who knew about nutrition rather than saying "feed him expensive dog food" and assumed that was good...and the dog was cured.<br /><br />Do I work for this company? No. I am a very active Amazon reviewer who speaks up heavily, especially when it comes to pets, in all my reviews of things I love or things I don't.  My dogs thrive on this but I will say, they are not fans of their dog treats. So I just look at labels and find all natural dog treats (charlee bear brand has good ones) I have no ties to this company whatsoever except for the fact that I used to only feed my dogs food I made until a vet who was an expert in nutrition told me about this (In fact this vet ALWAYS treats from the cause rather than the symptoms first...a rarity as to how vets are taught to heal.)<br /><br />this was at a time I was too busy to cook and I didn't want to give my dog just canned food even though Newman's Own is equally as good as this...<br /><br />the difference in coat was striking.  I have tried a couple other brands and one of my poms always starts scratching. This has amino acids and things that treat the coat and skin and it's perfectly balanced.<br /><br />Depending upon where you live it may be cheaper to buy direct. I anxiously await the day they finally get this on Amazon with free shipping but it has not happened yet. I'd get it on subscription then.<br /><br />There is a difference. There is a huge difference. I've spent years studying in order to be informed and I recommend few dog foods. This, however, in my opinion, is simply one that no other dog food has ever come close to when I read ingredients and balance of ingredients and look at how it's made and what kind of meat.<br /><br />If you ate artificial and processed chicken mcnuggets every day you'd fall ill too. When our dogs do people rarely suspect the dog food...they live such short lives anyway....nothing should be off balance, artificial, preservative-laden, processed, etc in their diets either so that even if they live a long life it is a full and healthy one with less arthritis, less kidney issues, less scratching etc.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.

review/summary: The best dog food on the market.
review/text: *Note: This may seem like a shill review, but I am in no way affiliated with Flint River - I am just one happy customer (well three counting my wife and pup)! Many thanks to Chandler for enlightening me on this company and much of the info below!<br /><br />This is without a doubt the best dog food on the market. Forget all of these pet store-sold brands that use words like "plus", "pro-formula" and "healthy" - it's marketing hype and is not beneficial for your dog. After talking with Chandler (see first reviewer) my wife and I decided to give Flint River Ranch a go. We had been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00264TMWU">Blue Buffalo Dry Food for Small Breed Dogs</a> and we were generally quite pleased. They at least used natural ingredients in beneficial amounts (meat always main ingredient) - but after reading up on the difference in meat quality used, as well as several recalls over the past 3 years, we decided it was time for a change. Chandler's helpful post has already outlined why using human-grade meat is important so I won't go over that, but to highlight one important thing every dog owner should realize: your dog is not a wild wolf! It has been domesticated over generations, changing its genetic makeup; he or she can't handle poor quality meat.<br /><br />Our pup had recently been suffering from allergies - Blue Buffalo helped a little but they were still present. As cute as it is to have our little pup bound up to us with a runny nose every now and then, we knew that she must be uncomfortable! We were going to go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139TT72">Newman's Own Dog Food</a> but our dog is a 24lb. whippet mix and an examination of the kibble at a friend's place showed it to be a little too big for her. So, we jumped on Flint River's website and put an order in. We were a little nervous about our picky eater - she has a hard time with  Eukanuba when visiting the in-laws, and even when we tried a different Blue Buffalo food to mix things up she was hardly enthusiastic. Luckily for us, she jumped right on her bowl of Flint River the first time around! The kibble itself is more like broken up dog biscuits:<br /><br />PROS<br />- Human-grade meat is used<br />- No artificial preservatives or fillers<br />- NO ANIMAL BY-PRODUCTS<br />- Food is twice-baked to preserve healthful properties<br />- Nicely sized, even for smaller dogs<br />- Food has never been recalled<br />- Customer Service far exceeds expectations<br />- Our dog seemed to love it<br /><br />"CONS"<br />- Price<br /><br />I put "cons" in parentheses because while you are paying more for your food, you are (a) looking out for your buddy which in my mind is worth it, and (b) you may be saving money of vet visits down the road. Dogs are genetically quite similar to humans. If a person takes care of themselves by eating well and exercising often, doctor's visits are only necessary for injuries and check-ups (at least in my experience). The same goes with dogs and vet visits!<br /><br />Listen, no dog food is going to magically make your dog run like a greyhound and pull people out of burning buildings like Lassie, but smart choices lead to a better life for your pup. Heck, we don't even know how old our dog is (looks like a puppy but has some grey on the muzzle), but we want to invest in her life by making good choices! Nothing irks me more than reviews on pet food that say "My dog didn't like this food, ONE STAR!" - your dog can't smell what food is best for them. Give it time, allow them to get used to this food and for their body to reap some of the benefits, and I hope you will find it as worth it as we did! We have only been using it for a few weeks now, but I will updated this review in a couple of months when we really start to see the positive effects!<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTES:<br />* Still not convinced? Flint River offers four sample meals of their food for less than five bucks shipped. Give it a try before you drop the premium price!<br />*This is actually cheaper when purchased directly from the manufacturer!<br />* Within an hour of my ordering the samples, I had two LONG emails with tips on changing my dog's diet as well as some general info on allergies. I had mentioned my dogs allergies and I got a very detailed explanation of diagnosis and treatment!<br /><br />This food is recommended by my wife and I (and our little girl, Poppy) without reservation - if you can't afford to cook fresh chicken and rice for your dog each day, this is the next best thing! Absolutely worth the price!

It's not too hot, but has heat, and it's just plain yummy. Can't seem to find it in stores.  This company wasn't the cheapest per bottle, but they only charged 1 shipping price for all 4 bottles I ordered.  Everybody else wanted to charge shipping per bottle.

review/summary: Lost art of malt baking
review/text: Malt flavoring in baking (or other culinary delights) is a lost art.<br /><br />My Mom owned a bake shop until she was about 75 years old and knew many of the secrets of great baking.<br /><br />Malted flour was one of them.<br /><br />I use this primarily for baking light rye bread, and, for waffles.  It is not possible to find a substitute.<br /><br />This is great for honey whole wheat.  Honey is a great flavor additive, but, it addition to being a sweetener for the yeast, honey is also a natural antiseptic, so, it tends to retard the yeast.  A tablespoon or a couple of ounces of this stuff helps keep the yeast at its proper activity level in honey whole wheat bread.<br /><br />When you are baking, you can adjust your leavening because the natural sugars in this ingredient will accelerate both yeast and baking powder or soda.<br /><br />This is an excellent quality product and empowers to home chef to make delights from a bygone era.  A small amount of malted barley will enhance the flavor of many bakery items that need a little bit of a sweetener and which can benefit from a whisper of an exotic taste.<br /><br />Here is an excellent recipe for Norwegian waffles:<br /><br />2 fresh organic free-roaming eggs<br />1 cup of organic all-purpose unbleached flour <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001YYOUC">Flour, All Purpose, Unbleached, 5 lb.</a><br />1 cup of organic whole wheat flour <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001YYOT8">Whole Wheat Bread Flour, 1 lb.</a><br />1/2 cup of olive oil (EVO) (you can substitue melted butter if you like)<br />1-3/4 cups of buttermilk<br />1 tablespoon of brown sugar<br />2 tablespoons of malted barley flour<br />4 teaspoons baking powder<br />1/4 teaspoon salt<br /><br />Pour into the center of the iron, immediately pour in some chopped pecans.<br /><br />When done (about 5 minutes or until tops steam) cover with shaved Norwegian (Viking) brown cheese (Ekte Gjetost) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D9MY5">Ekte Gjetost (1.1 pound) by [...</a>] . . . TO DIE FOR!<br /><br />Quick Tips for Master Baking:<br /><br />Start your yeast with some malted barley flour.  This works especially well for heavy breads like honey whole wheat and rye.  Take about three or four ounces of your water.  Make sure it is about body temperature (about 100 degrees F).  Add a few tablespoons of malted barley flour.  Add the yeast.  This will accelerate the yeast's activity and you need to get it into your mix after about a minute or two.  What you add to the water while starting your yeast often subtley determines the flavor of your bread or raised product.

review/summary: Flour, as stated, not powder
review/text: Searching the internet may tell you that malt flour is sometimes called malt powder.  This may lead you to believe that this is a malt powder, such as you might use for making beer or a killer malted milkshake.  Although this product is visually indistinguishable from such malt powder, it tastes like flour, and cannot be used for these purposes unless you like four in your milkshake.  It does make for really good pancakes, as long as you don't add too much.  I would go no more than 1/4 malt flour to 3/4 regular flour, and possibly less.

review/summary: Use as a dough improver
review/text: The reason for using the malted barley flour is to introduce the enzyme amylase into your yeast dough.  Amylase is used in breadmaking to break down complex sugars, such as the starch found in flour, into simple sugars. Yeast then feeds on these simple sugars and converts it into alcohol and CO2. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This is the reason for long fermented doughs such as sour dough. Modern breadmaking techniques have included amylases (often in the form of malted barley) into bread improver, thereby making the process faster.  So you really want to use just a little of the malted barley flour.  You can also use the more concentrated diastatic malt powder. (or a bread improver that includes either one) (mostly from Wikipedia)

review/text: This malted barley flour seems to be only partially fermented, so it is less sweet than others available here.  If you try to use it in a chocolate malted drink, you will get a lot of raw flour taste along with its modest sweetness.  It is really good, however, for putting in cakes and bread, adding a nice touch of sweetness and it really kickes the yeast into gear for light baked goods.  The milling and packaging is of good quality with this product.

review/summary: sprouts or malt?
review/text: I know growing malt is difficult, but this is to much. Bobs red mill needs better quality control. The flour is tart with a touch of bitter. Without even a touch of sweetness to the flour, it is not a malt, as malting was developed to bring out the sugars naturally found in the 1 to 3 day old sproutlings. With this "malt" not being sweet I can only suggest the sprouts have been overgrown.<br /><br />Update: I have now received my second order (1/17/2012) of bob's red mill's malted barley flour and am very pleased. The flour is slightly sweet. On this batch they must have given the seedlings 5 hours of maturation, after soaking for sprouting, instead of immediately drying after soaking as may have been the case. Correction; in my above statment of "...can only suggest the sprouts have been overgrown.", I could have also suggested the sprouts were dryed to soon! My rating has gone up to 3 stars.

review/summary: too much!
review/text: Well, I thought I had done my research. I am not new to bread making, but was wanting to add that malty taste to some of my loaves. The four smelled good when I opened it, and used 1/4 of the total amount of the flour called for in the recipe with this malted barley flour...as a bread book told me I could! I have since seen that info on line as well! OMG! The loaf never baked and stayed completely gummy.I've never seen the like. Upon further research, this flour is not what I had thought it was. The info out there and in baking books on barley flour is not complete and very misleading. Now I have 4 bags of this stuff. I wasted a lot of money for something you don't even need to make a good loaf of bread. I think what I need for my malt flavor is simply Malt Extract. I should have figured that out since my husband brews beer. I didn't think this WAS Malt extract, but I thought it was going to be the thing to use in breads! As it turns out this is diastatic malt and breaks down the starches in the flour. Why would you need that when white flour is already a refined starch? I MIGHT add a teaspoon or two of this to a 100% whole grain loaf, but what to do with 4 bags? You better own a bakery when ordering this bulk product and you better be baking a lot of 100% whole grain breads!...I think adding some vital gluten and starting the whole grain bread with an 8-12 hour sponge makes more sense than using this product though.

review/text: My doctor originally referred this tea to me after 1.5 months post-delivery. I've been using this tea for about a week now, and feel that I can confidently say that it does increase milk supply. Now I was drinking tea (Tazo Awake, Bigelow English Breakfast, and any green tea) several times a day on a regular basis, so it wasn't the extra fluid intake that caused the milk increase. Prior taking this tea, I was getting around 2-3 ounces when using a breast pump. After about 3-4 days of using the tea, I am getting anywhere from 3.5-5+ ounces per pump session. Not bad at all. :)<br /><br />The tea does taste very herbal and earthy (kind of like a Chinese herbal shop/pharmacy, or Dong Quai). Though it didn't bother me, it could be strong for some who are used to lighter smelling teas. A good way to counteract the taste, is adding a spoonful of honey which goes really well with the tea's naturally sweet flavor.

review/summary: Cerified Organic Mother's Milk tea that works just fine!
review/text: This mother's milk definitely has a good amount of Fenugreek (500 mg) and it definitely works. Now, for me because my supply wasn't "super low" as I had thought. My "cup did not runneth over" so to speak. But, it works and that is all that matters.<br /><br />Great bargain from The Vitamin Shoppe with shipping for only $0.99 the very last 2 times I ordered this.<br /><br />I am huge fan of tea and grew up drinking hot tea of all kinds, even Chinese tea with no sugar on occasions. And even without sugar, which is how I initially drank it, this tea is great. It does start to give you a maple-syrupy body odor if you are taking enough of it to boost your supply but that is great because you want to make sure you take enough it to know whether it's working or not!

review/summary: On the 'hit' list!
review/text: I recently picked a bushel of Jonagold at a local orchard, and was asked to bring an apple dessert for 14. I had found this mix at the market but still wanted to check my cookbooks for a traditional crisp recipe. No luck --maybe this type of dessert is too old-fashioned.. so I decided to give the mix a go. For texture I added chopped crystallized ginger and a half-cup of granola (one with mostly cereal grains) and a bit of flour and brown sugar. The taste was ideal and I can't wait to get more!

review/summary: 30 yr Condimento???
review/text: In the process of trying to find a nice bottle of Balsamico for my brother-in-law, I came across the following nice discussion of Balsamic Vinegars:<br />[...]<br /><br />You read, you decide. The label clearly states that this vinegar is 30 years old - no argument there. However, it is listed as a "condimento", which is an unregulated designation typically ascribed to younger balsamicos.<br /><br />Hey- if you've got enough spare cash, buy a bottle of this and a bottle of a "Tradizionale" (say, a gold Modeno or a silver Reggio Emilia) and provide a review.<br /><br />Me? I can't afford two -- and probably wouldn't buy one at all if it wasn't a gift for my foodie bro'-in-law.....<br /><br />This might be a stellar vinegar. But how does it compare with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014EMI2E">Traditional Aged Balsamic of Reggio Emila 24 Year Argento Silver</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YIRHOY">Affinato, Aceto Balsamic Tradizionale di Modena DOP</a>?<br /><br />Beats me....

review/summary: Great energy enhancer and mix with very low calorie flavors
review/text: I have tried both 45mg and 90mg versions and the 90 version adds a real sudden punch. I will occasionally use this water to make herbal tea or green tea in the morning to get a decent "kick" to get going (don't like the taste of most black teas). I also add True Lemon pink lemonade drink powder sometimes to get a good tasting water when needing some extra energy with the taste. Also will use with some pre-workout muscle building powder and mix well and drink during weight training sessions. What I have found is that the caffeine has a much more IMMEDIATE effect because instead of sipping you actually drink 16 oz in 5-7 minutes (or less) and you can feel a decent buzz right away even with the 45mg version.

review/summary: Strange floating stuff and bitter taste, plus no company response
review/text: I bought a 4-pack of the 90mg water while on a trip. When I got home, I put it in the fridge and was interested to try it. My first impression was that there was a bitter taste to it, kind of like aspirin. Certainly not the "Like nothing" that the bottle promises. Then I made the mistake of looking into the bottle -- there were a number of transparent masses floating around in it, almost like little jellyfish. I've emailed the company several times from their lousy website to see if this is normal or if my batch is contaminated, and after a month there has been no response. All 4 bottles, including the unopened ones, have this floating stuff in it. That can't be normal! So to summarize, doesn't taste like water, certainly doesn't taste "like nothing" -- tastes bad. Second, the company can't be bothered to respond to consumers, so I won't be bothering with them. Guess I'm back to Lo-carb Monster. So long, avitae -- wish I'd never met you.

review/summary: Edible if a bit gooey, but there are better gluten-free bars
review/text: The texture of these bars surprised me a little - they're very flat oblong bars made of somewhat gooey stuff and covered in seeds.  Not the sort of thing I usually eat as a snack, but the taste is pleasant enough, a kind of sweetness that tastes vaguely like honey, flavored with sesame seeds.  The natural ingredients are appealing - but still, they have 210 calories, with 15 grams of fat and 5 grams of fiber.  I used to carry them with me when I was travelling, given how hard it is to find something that is gluten-free without being impossibly sugary and/or fatty to have on hand just in case I get stranded in a hotel or airport where I can't find food I know is gluten-free.<br /><br />But then I discovered a better choice: Quest low-carb high-protein bars.  They're also gluten-free and come in lots of flavors, including apple pie, cinnamon roll, lemon meringue pie, etc., but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006W20AFA">Quest Bar 100% Natural Chocolate Peanut Butter</a> is my favorite.  These bars taste a lot better - dense and very chewy (microwaving for 11 seconds will soften them if you find them too chewy) - and they have only 160 calories, with 5 grams of fat and 17 grams of fiber.  (Different flavors vary slightly - all the "100% natural" ones have 2 grams of net carbs, though.)  Either for the taste or the healthiness of the all-natural ingredients, there's no comparison.

review/summary: My favorite blend from Celestial Seasonings in K-Cups for convenience
review/text: I love this blend of tea--I've been drinking it since it came on the market (back in the old days when the packages were psychedelic and quirky, and Red Zinger had almost 20 different herbal ingredients--now sadly reduced to a much less complex blend.) However, Sleepytime may have changed its package but the blend is the same--lime blossom (linden flowers or tilia, same thing), chamomile and spearmint. This is a brilliant mix, the linden and chamomile floral, sweet and soporific, the spearmint adding just enough of a hit to make it interesting. It's good as an after-dinner digestif, or as a before-bed soothing drink.<br /><br />Each ingredient has a purpose; linden is a relaxer and is said to restore the liver (hence, it's used as a tisane in France, where livers are always suspected of being upset), chamomile is a tension-tamer and soothes the stomach, and spearmint is a digestive (unless you have GERD--mints can be irritating, sad to say.) After a heavy meal, this tea can soothe a stomach. As a before-bed potion, it's unparalleled. I drink this almost every evening. You can serve it to children with a bit of milk and sugar to make "cambric tea" which is an old recipe for a posset to serve to children, too young for caffeine. (Cambric is a white, sheer fabric, so "cambric tea" is white and thin, no color.)<br /><br />You actually don't need to have K-cups--just brew a cup of hot water from the Keurig and dip in a Sleepytime tea bag. But if you are serving guests at table or in your office, a dripping tea bag is a nuisance and I for one am not a person who drinks her tea with the bag sitting in the mug. I just can't do it, though I know many people do. Call me a fussbudget but I don't like sipping past a steeping bag. The K-Cup makes a perfectly steeped cup immediately and no messy bag to clean up. So if you drink this on the way to work in a travel mug or don't want to deal with a tea bag, the K-Cup is very  nice indeed.

review/summary: sleepytime tea
review/text: I am glad I got the chance to use this tea in my Keurig but my advice is to go back to make it the old-fashioned way, it delivers a huge difference in taste using K-cups. You might like it but never me

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Great deal and great taste. I love making tea in my Mr.Coffee Keurig brewer, and this is by far one of my favorites. For all you tea lovers, try the Lemon Zest flavor by Celestial Seasonings as well, it's amazing.

review/summary: Quick and Easy Tea
review/text: Sleepytime has long been one of my favorites. I love the minty, herbal flavor and the fact that it is caffeine free.  Now, with the Keurig cups, it couldn't be easier to have a hot cup of tea in the afternoon.  Keurig isn't the least expensive way to go, for sure.  Much higher than tea bags.  But it makes a flavorful cup of whatever you brew - tea, coffee, mochas, cider. It's all good.

review/summary: Decent, but not a great code date
review/text: This chamomile tee is of average quality, but the most annoying part about it is that the expiration date on it was a month away from when it came.  I think that's a little fast to go through a 24-pack of chamomile tea, when you have a variety of K-cups at your disposal.

review/summary: Best choice if you're making tea with a Keurig
review/text: Yes, they're expensive, but if you need to stock up some tea to go with your Keurig, this is the best choice.  Flavor is pretty much the same as the tea bags, unlike some of the other teas, which come out bitter and overly strong.

review/summary: GREAT CAKE
review/text: I wanted to give my mom a cake for her birthday, but I live 400 miles away from her.  I saw this cake and was a little nervous to purchase a cake online, not knowing if it would still be fresh by the time it reached her.<br /> Although they do not mention it, the cake was delivered frozen and packed in dry ice, inside a styrofoam container. It took a day in the refridgerator for the cake to thaw,but afterwards my mom said the cake was so moist and fresh that it tasted like it was just baked.  Also she said that it was so full of coconut that after the cake was gone there was still tons of coconut leftover.  So for me that was worth the price.

review/summary: Perfect Portions
review/text: I love flavored coffee - I'm a real latte lover...and this little gadget has made it much easier to achieve the exact flavor I wanted. Although it is possible to measure or simply 'pour' the sauce into your mug, it is risky, b/c like all condiments, it seems to take forever to start making its way to the bottle neck, resulting in an impatient shake which inevitably dumps entirely too much into the mug...so, to avoid all these messy little miscues, I ordered this handy sauce accessory and I am very happy with it.<br /><br />It's easy to install - simply remove the lid from your Da Vinci sauce, then put the pump in place, twist tightly and presto, you're ready to go!<br />It's also easy to clean up, hot, soapy water and the sticky residue left over by the ultra yummy sauce melts away. I would definitely recommend this accessory to anyone that uses the Da Vinci 1/2 gal sauces...it's reasonably priced and takes all the guess work out of creating your favorite latte.<br /><br />*Also, this, as well as, the sauces are shipped from the Beverage Gourmet, and I have nothing but glowing remarks to add about them as a provider. Their customer service is top notch and the deliveries are on time, every time!

review/summary: NOT THE PUMPS MADE BY DaVINCI!!!!
review/text: If you, like me, were looking for the pumps made by DaVinci for their half-gallon sauces, do not buy these. These are some other pump similar to the DaVinci pumps but not an exact fit and with many design flaws. These are too loose in the neck area and therefore won't screw down and attach at all. Also, they are more cheaply-made than the actual DaVinci ones and you have to do some assembly yourself, like attaching the bottom straw piece which also is not a tight fit so it falls out in your jug of sauce and good luck fishing it out. Oh and once you put these on your bottles and dispense a pump, any time you tap the pump in the slightest it will leak sticky syrup all over your counter, not fun.I promptly returned these. Do yourself a favor and order the actual DaVinci pumps from their website, I did and they were cheaper even after shipping anyway.

review/summary: Favorite tea thus far
review/text: I've tried a few different flavors but this flavor is by far my favorite.  It produces a strong, solid, slightly spicy flavor with a minimal amount of tea.  Sugar is almost unnecessary.  The leaves are re-usable up to about 3 times.  I'd order this over and over if the number of flavors available wasn't as enticing as it is!
