review/summary: Surprise! It's fantastic!
review/text: I grew up on Folgers coffee. It was simply the best affordable coffee that could be drank on a daily basis. I was glad that Folgers has formulated there distinct coffee for the K-Cup. A few years ago I did try using folgers ground coffee in one of those Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter and it just did not come out right. I have had no luck with the refillable K-Cup with any brand of coffee. I honestly believe that a lot of product testing goes into these K-cups. It's not as simple as fill it up and run water through it.<br /><br />Folgers Columbian K-cups taste exactly like I made it way back when with my Mr. Coffee. Becuse you are able to adjust the amount of coffee used in the Drip brewers this may or may not be as perfect of a match for your tastes. The one constant is the all important aftertaste. The Extra-Bold Newman's own and Doughnut Shop K-cups have a long, strong aftertaste that I really enjoy but they give you strong coffee breath. By comparison This Folgers has less of a aftertaste which Is nice when you know you will be in conversation with someone.<br /><br />There are many Columbian coffee K-cup choices and in reality they are all good. If you loved Folgers in the past. You won't be disappointed.

review/text: A tennis player hubby of mine got this pack on the rack of his opel corsa and casually,I started cherishing the peppermint flavour. It's gotta lasting refreshing flavour but the best part is, its real mouth freshner and above all, keeps my teeth so whiter and feels good chewing for a long time. Normally, Indians prefer 'mukhwas-masalas' after lunch or dinner but I prefer the chewing gum as it refreshes the taste buds. Good pick.

review/summary: Good Taste. Nice Mix of Nutrients.
review/text: I picked up a box of Wonderful Pistachios (24 1.5-ounce packets) on my last visit to my local Costco Store. They're a very nice pistachio. The roasting is perfect and they're lightly salted, just as I like them. The little bags are handy for snacks and lunches and are a way of keeping me in check when it comes to eating them. The pistachios are nicely opened and I've only found two "uncracked" so far. I save them in a pile and use the nutcracker on them when I get enough. The sodium content of a serving is quite modest relative to a lot of other nuts. The fat and calorie content is fairly high, but it's a less-harmful fat. The fiber and protein are moderately good. It's a nice mix of nutrients and a good taste.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I would compare these more with the Trader Joe's gluten free mix which is really good as well.

review/text: These WOW Gluten Free Brownies are exquisitely delicious. They are at least as good as brownies made from wheat products, if not better. They are moist and chocolaty. There is no sour or flat taste that is common with many gluten free baked goods. Because there is no gluten there is a lack of chewiness that is common to some fudge brownies, but the moist mouthwatering taste is unsurpassed.<br /><br />I have given these gluten free brownies to people who are not gluten intolerant and they wanted more. WOW knows how to bake!<br /><br />The one caveat, if you are lactose intolerant, is that WOW uses butter as an ingredient. If a dozen are ordered, I would also recommend putting some in the freezer. It helps dissuade from eating all of them at once and keeps them around longer. These are absolutely "finger lickin' good"!

review/summary: I Throw Away Other Cheese Straws
review/text: First of all, I would like to comment regarding previous reviews. I do not think the first review in 2005 was done by an employee, and that's not really a fair statement but rather an assumption lacking any real fact or evidence. It seems like a very small company that just enjoys making cheese straws and wants to share them with others. I sincerely doubt that, at the great price they are, the company even makes a ton of profit - which is a shame.<br /><br />Secondly, after tasting Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws for the first time this Fall, I will not eat anyone else's. I literally threw away a package of a VERY POPULAR cheese straw company that I received yesterday as a gift because when I tasted them, they just tasted bland and floury. I could not even bring myself to finish them. I crave Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws so much. (I recommend trying them with some Shiraz or other wine!)<br /><br />Our company gave out Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws as a corporate customer gift this year, and I bet that Aunt Lizzie will have a slew of new customers after that. Thanks, Aunt Lizzie!! :)

review/summary: 1st Review Written By Employee
review/text: If you read the first review and then read the company literature it will become obvious that the 1st review was either written by an employee or was copied from the literature. I will say the cheese straws are the best I have ever tasted. From the flavor to the crunchy feel in my mouth, I am addicted to Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. The negative? Customer service is non existent. An order that was placed on the internet was subsequently lost, even though I received a confirmation via email. I was offered no discount or upgraded shipping, no additional product with my order, no discount on my next order, not even an apology for the 7 day delay. Just an excuse that the email order was lost and that her IT guy would be on the problem tomorrow. Personally, I can count the number of times an email has been lost over the last 10 years on one hand. This is not the first problem I have had with an order. They do not give a tracking number with each order and when asked for one after the order is placed the odds of getting one are 50-50. I have had so many problems with my orders I will go without my Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. I will miss them greatly however I need the hassle associated with ordering them less than I need the cheese straws. ANN, I wish you the best in the future and suggest you participate in customer service training classes to refrain from losing additional customers in the future. FOLLOW UP: I just received an email notifying me that my order shipped on the Aug 9th. I have not placed an order! What more can they do?

review/text: The peanut butter and honey ones are like a candy bar, as state previously.  I can't resist them sometimes when I'm not even working out.  They're delicious.<br />Plus, the company is a really great, which is a bonus.<br />AND I can pronounce and recognize all the ingredients on the back of the bar.<br />Not the most carbs, not the most protein, but it's a good all around training bar....<br /><br />...or a delicious afternoon snack!

Not too sweet, and the size is good for quick snack, plus it's filling.  What more could you ask for?<br /><br />So why 4 stars and not 5?  because it's pricey.

review/text: This coffee has an average taste with no major undertones. It has a lighter taste than what I am accustomed to (Starbucks) so I had to use more to acheive the same flavor density. I couldn't tell any flavor difference between the decaf and non-decaf versions, and since I'm cutting back on caffeine, this has become a welcome staple in my home. It made a nice iced coffee as well.

review/summary: Excellent Food to Have on Hand.
review/text: We try to keep our pantry stocked with a number of items that can be used in a wide variety of situations, that require little preparation, that are nutritionally sound and that have a very long shelf life. One such item is Rosarita's refried beans and of the various types available we prefer the Traditional Variety. We buy them in cases of 8 16-ounce cans at our local warehouse club store, but they're widely available at almost any large grocery outlet. A variety of different brands are available, but Rosarita's Frijoles is by far our favorite.<br /><br />We use the beans in a wide variety of situations. We serve them with eggs or various types of meat. They can be used in a variety of situations where mashed potatoes might fit. We use them with items purchased from local Mexican restaurants and taco shops. We use them as side dishes with sandwiches. They take such minimal preparation that a serving of hot refried beans can be ready in a matter of minutes. And they're delicious. Plus, these beans pack a lot of excellent nutrition. They're high in protein and dietary fiber and low in fat. The sodium/potassium ratio is about even and a serving is only about 120 calories. Beans are notorious for producing gas, but we've never had a problem with Rosarita's Frijoles. It's an excellent food to have on hand.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I love Rosarita Refried Beans.  I grew up in Mesa Az where these beans were manufactured (at least a long time ago) and I have always thought they were the best on the market.  I can't always find them on the east coast so when I saw them available through Amazon I was thrilled.  They have a smooth texture and subtle taste so they can be used in any recipe.

review/summary: WOW! At last!!!
review/text: Of all the "Subscribe and Save" products, this is the one I've been waiting for -- Rosarita refried beans are a real staple, my #1 comfort food and #1 earthquake-preparedness food. With my Prime membership this works out to about a dollar a can, which is a decent price, and these cans are heavy to lug home on foot from the market! Add a tablespoon of chicken stock or water if the beans are too thick for your tastes. They're ideal with scrambled eggs, you want them to make a burrito out of, they're great on their own, maybe with some salsa or grated cheese -- I really love these beans. Very highly recommended! I'd read that Californians who had moved with their jobs back east to the Carolinas would have people visiting California ask "Do you want me to bring you some beans?" -- they're that iconic and that good. I've made my own refried beans from scratch and it's not a simple task. I am so pleased to be able to buy these from amazon.com!!!<br />--<br />Help!! The price went from $22 to $42 in two months!!!! Not such a great deal any more!!!

review/summary: Great refried beans - but beware dented cans!
review/text: The beans:  Delicious, not too salty, plenty of flavor.<br /><br />The cans:  The 24 cans are sitting in a single layer in a shallow cardboard flat (like the bottom half of a box) wrapped in plastic.  This flat will probably be loosely included in a larger carboard box with little additional packaging (e.g, some crumpled butcher paper).  End result - you may wind up with 18 cans with dents of various severity, that will leave you wondering how long they will remain safe to eat.

review/summary: Overpriced shipping charges
review/text: It may be unfair for me to rate this one star for something that I should have noticed beforehand, but so be it. I bought these beans as part of my preparation for moving overseas. I was able to get most everything I needed locally but wanted some beans and ordered them here. I didn't look at the receipt until I got settled in Nigeria and the bulk shipment arrived. Imagine my shock at realizing I'd paid $26.21 for the beans and $20.89 for shipping on them. And this was with the "We've shipped this part of your order separately at no extra cost"!<br /><br />If you've got Prime this may be worth the convenience but otherwise, don't bother.

review/summary: From the USA not China
review/text: As other reviewers have pointed out, these crunch dried apples have their own unique consistency.  I find them to be much more like other freeze dried snacks as opposed to the consistency of a dried apple.  Because of food allergies, we're quite limited in what fruits our children can eat and what can be added to them.  It was truly a relief to find organic apple snacks without a list of additives and other fruits mixed in.  While others may prefer different types of fruits mixed together, we need snacks that are limited to the fruit that mentioned.  For example, fruit leathers often include pear even when they're listed as grape fruit leather.  These are what they claim to be...apple!<br /><br />The second most important aspect for us is that these snacks are from the USA.  Unlike the other brands, these are not from China.  We make every effort to avoid toys from China, and definitely have no interest in eating food from China.<br /><br />While these are extremely expensive, amazon makes them more affordable than my supermarket.  Because of the food allergies, we have so few snacks we can eat on the go.  These are a nice alternative to cuttting up apples and packing them.

They stay crunchy and fresh and you will polish off a bag in no time, so there is no worry about storage after the bag is opened.  One downside... they are expensive.  I actually tried to 'make these' in my food dehydrator.  Not at all the same crunch and flavor.  These are the best that I have tried anywhere and I have tried a lot of different brands. The Apple is the best of this brand :) All natural too and healthy!

review/text: They're alright. But not what I expected. I was hoping it would be more like the other brands of dried apples - crispy, but then melt in your mouth. I bought these for my toddler, but the pieces are big, hard, and do not melt in your mouth. I'm afraid they present a bit of a choking hazard for a one year old.<br /><br />On the bright side - they are NOT made in China! I suppose if you're into dried apples for yourself, they should work.

review/text: I just ate a bag, so I thought this would be a good time to review it.  The bags are small, but a great size if you want to limit your snacking without having to engage your willpower.  The apple pieces (from California organic apples) are pretty small, and they're light (dehydrated) and crispy.  They are not extremely sweet, but I prefer their moderate sweetness to supersweet dried fruit pieces.  These make a great quick snack anytime, and they are especially nice as a healthy kids' lunch item when you realize you just ran out of fresh fruit.

When I travel, I keep one or two in the car, my luggage, my gym bag, etc. For a light and sweet (yet slightly tart) snack, one of these apple treats is hard to beat! With only 70 calories per pouch, it really hits the spot, especially if you eat it while consuming a bottle of water/thermos of water to step up the hydration. They are not expensive, if you put them on auto-ship with amazon prime--well worth the money. My entire family eats them, young and old, so I always have a full box on hand. Great Deal!

review/summary: Why are the pieces so small?
review/text: These apples taste fine, since there are no artificial additives, but they sure are small.  The average piece is 1/2 an inch by 1/2 an inch, which is quite pathetic and unsatisfying (for me).  I have to eat multiple pieces at once to notice any apple-like aromas.  I do appreciate the crunch but they also detracts from the sweetness, because its harder to dissolve and release the sugars when the pieces are this dry.  It's not a bad product, but I would not buy it again.

review/summary: Terrible Packaging
review/text: We opened the box to find the jelly beans sitting directly in the box.  No bag, no plastic container (as the description states)...just literally a cardboard box full of jelly beans.  How clean are cardboard shipping boxes?  The box was taped on top to seal it but air, bugs could easily get through the unsealed edges.  The jelly beans were good and still tasted fresh but we were very disappointed in the packaging.

review/summary: Great chip that is different from the rest
review/text: I like the puffed nature of this chip that makes it more unique in the chip market.  I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.

review/text: I just love these chips!  I was always a big fan of potato chips, but haven't had one since I discovered popchips.  They are great for dipping or all alone.  I am constantly re-ordering them.  One note however-if you are on a low salt diet these chips are probably not for you. They are high in sodium.  We go through a case every two months.  If you love them it pays to join the subscribe and save program through Amazon.  You save money and stay supplied!

Oh, and an FYI, these are way better than rice cakes-people keep comparing the two and I totally disagree).<br />The 0.8 oz bag is perfect single size (pretty generous actually).<br />Yummy!

review/summary: Awesome healthIER snack option!
review/text: I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind.

review/summary: A lower calorie alternative to standard chips: 120 calories/oz. A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored
review/text: The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of "there must be something better".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per "serving"), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word "puff" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed "all natural". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.

The other flavors weren't so great (salt & pepper and cheddar aren't too bad) but this one rocked.

review/summary: Great Chips Less Fat
review/text: I eat chips almost every day and decided I wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips. I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of "regular" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor.

review/summary: Best "healthy" salt and vinegar chip out there
review/text: I am always on the hunt for a good lower fat salt and vinegar chip and I have to say, it is a very hard thing to find! I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far. I would recommend it.<br /><br />Yes, I know, I appear to be obsessed with S&V chips...it is a little scary.

review/text: I love these salt and pepper flavored Popchips.  The bag size is perfect for a snack.  I love them in the afternoon when I get home from work, or at lunch with a sandwich.  Of course since they are "salt and pepper", there's a lot of salt.  I have to watch my sodium intake and it limits the number of bags I can eat.  Also, I would like to see the salt and pepper flavor included in the variety box instead of the vinegar, which I don't like at all.  Tastes too strong of vinegar.  Would be great for someone who absolutely loves vinegar.  It would also be nice if you could create your own variety box with the flavors you most prefer.  It does get a little boring eating 24 bags the same flavor.
