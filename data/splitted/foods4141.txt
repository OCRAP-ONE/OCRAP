review/summary: Sugar High!!!
review/text: Reason for Smiling after eating this cereal is that you are on a sugar high! It contains brown sugar, evaporated cane juice and honey, but wait even the crisp rice contains sugar. Even with the antioxidants this is not a health food. There are so many better choices out there, including making your own granola, which I do. All you need is an oil, sweetener, roll oats and a oven. Add what you enjoy such as almond and cinnamon. Give it a try. Enjoy!!

Not only are they good.. but they are good for you as a healthier for you snack. Only problem is convincing yourself to stop eating them :)Enjoy!

review/summary: Tasty and very chunky granola
review/text: One of the things I appreciated most about this granola is that the ingredient list was not overly lengthy and had not a single ingredient that I couldn't pronounce or identify.  Its primary ingredients are whole grain rolled oats, almonds, cocoa and cinnamon.  Another is that it is not overly sweet.<br /><br />For me, the biggest downside to the granola is that, when I first opened the bag, many of the "clusters" were HUGE...the size of maybe 1/2 of a small candy bar.  If you're the type that eats granola as a snack right out of the bag, then that is probably going to be an advantage.  For me, it was a disadvantage.  I don't eat a lot of granola; but when I do, I use it as a light crunchy topping for yogurt or ice cream.  As such, I want it in smaller pieces.  I took a meat mallet to my bag and rectified the situation. :)<br /><br />The flavor of the granola is excellent.  In some bites, I get mostly a taste of cocoa and cinnamon and the crunch of the oats.  In others, I get more of the nut taste and texture.  As noted before, this granola is not overly sweet, which I like.  Despite the preponderance of cocoa in this granola, don't buy this expecting it to taste like a candy bar--this is cocoa, not chocolate.  Sweeteners listed include brown sugar, evaporated cane juice and honey.<br /><br />I thought it was misleading that the this variety is called "Cinnamon Almond" when the primary flavor is cocoa, but perhaps that is because all of their granolas are cocoa-based?  Not sure.  To me, it tastes much more of both cocoa and cinnamon than of almond.  I would never consider almond a primary flavor in it and I eat almonds pretty regularly, so I know their taste.<br /><br />If you like a good crunch, you're going to like this.  Your jaw definitely gets a workout when eating it, esp. if you don't break down those giant "clusters."  Just be forewarned--it is pretty addicting!<br /><br />Last but not least, here is the per-serving nutrition information:<br /><br />Serving Size 1/3 cup<br /><br />Calories  160<br />Total Fat  6g<br />Sat Fat  2g<br />Trans Fat  0<br />Cholesterol  0<br />Sodium  85mg<br />Potassium  120mg<br />Total Carbs  24g<br />Fiber  3g<br />Sugars  12g<br />Protein  3g<br /><br />Contains Calcium, Vitamins A, B6, C and E and several minerals.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/text: The first few bites of these clusters were good, but I quickly grew bored of the taste.  It was too chocolaty, and within a day of opening the bag the product quickly became chewy, like it was stale.<br /><br />Although the shipment came with 4 bags, I ended up finishing only one.  Two were thrown away half-eaten, and the fourth was tossed altogether.

review/summary: If there were laws against tasty snacks, this one broke them all...
review/text: Here's my thoughts on these tasty granola clusters:<br /><br />LOOKS: When opening the bag, I didn't have to work very long to find large clusters, they were sitting on top. Each piece was coated in cocoa, and the oats and almonds were waiting below the surface.<br /><br />PACKAGING: I was pleased to see these bags were resealable. Easy to open, easy to seal, no fussin', no mussin'.<br /><br />SERVING SIZE: Each pouch has roughly 10 servings each. Keep in mind, it's easy to keep on snacking, so pour yourself a handful and leave the bag on the counter if you're trying to make the bag last more than 2 hours...<br /><br />TASTE: The cocoa flavoring really popped out, it's the first smell that hit me when I opened the bag. The next taste was an even mixture between the oats and almonds. I barely tasted the cinnamon at all, but that's just me.<br />Simply put - I LOVED this dry granola snack. One of my coworkers said she would prefer these over Girl Scout Samoa cookies, that's a pretty bold statement!<br /><br />CONCLUSION?<br /><br />If you're looking for something to snack on while you watch Mad Men or plow through another dungeon in Skyrim, this is an excellent choice. Keep a glass of milk nearby!

review/summary: I wish the clusters are smaller
review/text: I like putting granola clusters on top of my oatmeal or use them as cereal - I could not do it with this. This is purely for snacking, finger food, and it's perfect for that purpose.<br /><br />The chocolate isn't very chocolatey, but it's a bit bitter. The cinnamon is very strong. In fact, I think the cinnamon flavor is much stronger than the chocolate. Overall, I enjoyed this snack as a snack, but it really isn't more useful than a snack. I really wanted to use it in my cereal, or as a cereal.<br /><br />It isn't too sweet, which is a big plus. Even though I give it a four star, some of my friends loved it. They would have likely given it five stars.

review/summary: Nom. Nom. Nom.
review/text: I'd been seeing Eat.Think.Smile.'s products in my grocery store for a couple of months, so when the opportunity came to try this granola, I jumped at it.  I'm glad I did.  This is bite-sized chunks of granola rich with cocoa, cinnamon, and almonds.  It makes a filling snack and it tastes great.  But you should keep in mind that granola is not exactly a low-cal, low-fat, low-carb treat.  In a 1/3 cup serving there are 160 calories, 6g of fat, and 24g of carbs.  However, this snack has a goodly amount of potassium (120mg) and 3g of protein as well.  The ingredients include whole grain rolled oats, brown sugar, palm oil, almonds, evaporated cane juice, cocoa,crisp rice, honey, cinnamon, salt, natural flavor and soy lecithin.<br /><br />The granola pieces are very chewy, so it takes longer to eat them.  This is better than eating a candy bar that can be sucked down in a minute flat.  On the whole, I really enjoyed these, and so did the other members of my household.  I'll be buying more and trying other products from this company.

review/summary: Delicious...but more decadent than I anticipated
review/text: I'd probably give this product a 3.5 star rating if half stars were allowed here.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />The taste!  I honestly didn't expect to like this as much as I do, but I think the balance of cocoa and cinnamon is just right.  The cocoa, in particular, tastes VERY good.  I'm assuming a high quality cocoa is used in this product since it tastes much better than the mass market cocoa you'd likely find at your local grocery store.<br /><br />The texture.  This granola comes with lots of fairly large clumps, not just a bunch of small pieces.  It's definitely possible to eat this dry right out of the bag.  The almonds and whole grain oats contribute to a nice, crunchy texture.<br /><br />The not so good:<br /><br />The nutritional information.  If you are very good about controlling your intake, this could certainly be a fine addition as a snack.  I, however, have a hard time not overconsuming sweet foods, and this granola is definitely sweet (as most granolas are).  Just one serving of this granola packs 160 calories, with 50 of those being from fat and almost another 100 from carbohydrates (nearly half of those being listed as "sugars").  If you're doing your math, then you already know that that means this product provides very little protein -- in fact, only 3 grams per serving.  And here's the kicker:  All of that nutritional information is based on a serving size of only 1/3 cup, or 1.2 ounces of this product.  Each bag supposedly contains close to 10 servings.  I honestly think it would be far more reasonable to double the values above and double the serving size as I have a hard time imagining that most people would only eat 1/3 cup of this product at a time.

review/summary: very tasty, crunchy snack!
review/text: Keep in mind that 'clusters' is the key word here.  The size varies for all of the pieces (from tiny bits to pieces as big as a quarter if not larger), so I'm not sure I'd want to sprinkle these on my yogurt as suggested.  Dunk them in it? Heck yeah.  Eat them as is? Even better.  This is a very tasty, very crunchy snack that is big on the chocolate and cinnamon flavor.  Nothing overpowering, just a nice blend of flavors that lingers afterward and makes a great, healthy alternative to chocolates or other sweets.  The most difficult part is stopping after a handful of the things!

Perhaps it's a candidate for dipping in a mug of coffee or a glass of milk, like a hard cookie?

review/summary: A wonderful blend of granola; too bad nutrition facts betray the serving size
review/text: It has been my experience that granola has come a long way since I was a little kid.  My only real memory of granola was the bars and they were alright.  Now in modern times, granola is a versatile food item, finding its home on yogurt, as salad toppings, in baked goods and yes still in bar form (but even those are fancier). The one pratfall that most granola suffers from is a high fat and calorie count.  I have tried other top shelf brands of granola that is promoted as healthy and it really isn't.<br /><br />This leads us to "Eat. Think. Smile's" brand of granola.  There are several different flavors that ETS showcases, this is the blend is "cinnamon almond".  The staring flavors/ingredients are cocoa, whole grain oats, almonds and cinnamon.  The granola has a wonderful taste.  The flavors really blend well together, giving it a nice nutty and sweet balance.  The texture is crunchy with a slight chewy aspect.  In addition, since these are clusters, they would be great as salad or yogurt toppers and wonderful in baked goods.<br /><br />This product is all natural which is good, but this doesn't always translate to a healthy product.  A serving size is a third of a cup and is 160 calories and 6 grams of fat.  Personally I feel that is high for such a small amount.  Therefore, one needs to be careful not to eat too much of it.  In contrast, this product has no trans fat and cholesterol.  An interesting side note, I put some of this granola in a Pyrex container and it became a little stale.  Which is odd considering Pyrex containers are pretty much air tight.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this product.  It is much better than most granola I have tried, but it must be noted that this isn't a health food.  Actually, most granola isn't healthy, all natural or not.  However under moderation, this is a good snack and I am sure there are worst things out there to eat.

review/summary: Now we're talking... this is a snack that I can fully recommend!
review/text: First things first, the Cinnamon Almond Eat. Think. Smile. Granola Clusters taste great!  An honest cocoa flavor, crunchy and tasty!  Too many "health" snacks fail that test within one or two bites.  This stuff is good!<br /><br />Now, to the more complicated stuff.  After discarding the 80 or 90% of healthy snack foods who's flavor doesn't agree with me, I then run into conflict with the "reality of the nutrition label".  You know what I mean, "only 60 calories per serving!", then you note that there are 30 servings in the package.  Sound the alarm!  At first, I was a little leery on this count.  A 12 ounce bag of granola clusters contains 160 calories per serving.  Not outrageous, but a piece of math that instantly worries me, especially when the product tastes so good (did I mention that?  It tastes real good).  This is where I give these guys 5 stars... what looked to me as being a 10th of the package, ACTUALLY SATISFIES!  Usually... something this tasty suffers the ignominy of getting cleaned out in one setting, leaving me disappointed and weighing a pound or two more the following morning; not the case here!  A little goes a long way toward leaving you satisfied.<br /><br />I have never had this to say about a snack food product before, this is the first snack food that meets all of my expectations.  No trade-offs!  Great taste!  Great texture!  Natural, healthy ingredients!  And a satisfying snack!  Thank you guys!

review/summary: Big chunks
review/text: If you are more likely to eat granola dry as a snack food you may like this one because it is mostly in large chunks.  It's like eating hard irregularly  shaped chocolate cookies.  I did try it with almond milk for the sake of writing a well rounded review but although the cocoa did impart a chocolatly taste to the milk I did not enjoy trying to eat is as a cereal.  The second item in the ingredients list is sugar so I expected it to be overly sweet but it isn't.  Still I would not buy this granola because it was not delicious and although I like chunky granola as a snack food, these chunks are too hard.  Update - I put chunks of peeled sweet potato in the container I had the granola in, put the lid on, and next day the granola was way better.  Not nearly so hard so I could enjoy the taste more.  This would work even better with a cut up apple but I didn't have one.

The cinnamon is subtle, almost an aftertaste to the cocoa.  The individual clusters are solid and hearty; not too hard, not too soft. And OHhhhh, do these go great with morning coffee!

review/summary: Great snack food
review/text: First, this is like granola, but it's not cereal. Sure, you could put it in a bowl and pour milk over it, I guess, but it's much more fun to just eat straight out of the bag. It's kind of like a broken oatmeal cookie.<br /><br />First, the ingredients are natural and pretty simple, and the calorie count for a serving is reasonable. I think it's about 160 calories per serving, except that trying to decide how much a serving is when you have bits and pieces of granola isn't easy unless you're inclined to weigh your food. I'm not.<br /><br />What I liked about the cocoa was that not only did it taste good, the granola clusters don't leave a mess behind on my fingers. Packing a handful of this into a snack bag and taking it to work makes a nice snack and is healthier than raiding the vending machine. I like to snack on cereal and this takes it a step farther with the addition of cocoa. My only complaint, and it's too small to mark down the product, is that I really don't taste the cinnamon very much. I think it's overshadowed by the cocoa, although if I could try the product without cinnamon I might notice its absence.<br /><br />If you want an alternative to cookies and candy bars for snacks, give this a try.

review/summary: High calorie, high flavor snack...
review/text: Typical of granola snacks, this one packs quite a punch - in terms calories from fat (50 per serving). But it also packs a very generous flavor profile.  The cocoa clearly overpowers any of the almond (barely discernible) or cinnamon (very muted) in the granola - but the natural cocoa as opposed to the corn-syrup laden chocolate 'flavor' used in many brands clearly is a treat.  Paired with chai or even milk, this is a very good occasional snack. The favorite use in this household has been with plain or vanilla Greek yogurt.  Given the unique flavor, natural ingredients used the price/value is reasonable.  But due to the relatively high amount of calories from fat, this is at best an occasional snack paired with fruits/yogurt...

review/summary: Cinnamon Almond goodness with a balanced flavor
review/text: This is bite-size granola in a package that can be eaten a few at a time as a snack. Each package is 12 oz. and there are ten 1.2 ounce servings in each bag. Each serving is 160 calories with 50 calories from fat. There are 3 grams of protein and 12 grams of sugar in each serving. Each serving also constitutes  a daily dietary intake 12% in fiber and 8%. The first three ingredients are whole grain rolled oats, brown sugar, and palm oil.  Almonds are 4th on the ingredient list with cinnamon listed as the 8th ingredient.<br /><br />I am use to eating my granola with milk so this was a new twist on a what was formally a cerael.  I felt these were dry but they tasted really good. Drinking a glass of milk took away most of the dryness. There was a strong cocoa flavor and a not too strong cinnamon flavor. I didn't taste the almonds at all.  However, despite the "cinnamon almond" being low on the ingredients list, I felt these granola bites had a very balanced flavor that made me want more.<br /><br />Obviously granola is a high calorie snack and it's hard to eat just 1.2 ounces, especially of this flavor. Nevertheless, I feel it's much better to eat this than candy and cake.  Although this flavor is very good and very balanced,  after having tried this as a snack,  I would probably not purchase these because of the dryness.  However, I've been eating these for a couple of days and have discovered that putting these clusters in a salad takes away the dryness and gives the salad a nice crunch (like croutons) in addition to adding additional flavor.<br /><br />I had my boyfriend try these and he likes them.

review/summary: Quick and Tasty Snack
review/text: I like these tasty clusters.  They're quick and easy.  I like to eat them out of the bag, though somebody wanting a "cereal" could put them in a bowl with milk.  I also like that a serving (1/3 cup) has 3g fiber.<br /><br />I marked these down a star because my husband thinks they taste too chocolatey.  However, I think these clusters have the perfect amount of cocoa.

review/summary: Tasty snack
review/text: Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters is a tasty snack that I enjoyed quite a bit.  It's not exactly health food, but I don't think there would be an issue in enjoying this treat in moderation.<br /><br />Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters are made up of large granola clusters, too big to be eaten easily as a breakfast cereal but just the right size for snacking.  The most obvious ingredients are oats, almond bits, cocoa, and cinnamon.  Neither the cocoa or cinnamon taste is overpowering at all, and I found that the combination of these two tastes was much better than I would have expected.<br /><br />Now as I mentioned above I would not consider this product health food, despite the claims on the package about the antioxidant power of the cocoa and cinnamon.  After all, a small serving contains 6 grams of fat and 12 grams of sugar, and among the ingredients listed are brown sugar, palm oil, and evaporated sugar cane juice.  But as a substitute for more highly processed sweets this will do OK.  Overall I am a fan of Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters and would likely buy it in the future.

review/summary: Tasty cluster granola snack
review/text: Eat, think smile granola (Cinnamon Almond)are a very tasty snack although a buyer should be aware this product has cocoa in it and is chocolate based.  The clusters have a somewhat decadent taste and I would say a little goes a long way which is good since these are packed with calories and sugars.  I've tried them with milk and they actually taste better as a cereal.<br /><br />The package comes with a resealable ziplock fastener convenient for keeping the granola fresh.  Like most granola, the bigger clusters float at the top of the package and the bits and pieces end up at the bottom.  The clusters are big enough to hand individual pieces to kids are almost the size of small Halloween candy.

review/summary: It's pretty Darn tasty!
review/text: Granola isn't necessarily what I would call a health food.  Many mass produced brands have rather high amounts of sugar per serving size, and as someone that is watching her weight, it isn't necessarily a snack I choose for myself.  BUT, I won't deny to enjoying it!  I love the crunch, the sweet taste of the oats and the nuts-YUMMY!<br /><br />This isn't a cereal, which is how I usually prefer to eat my granola, but rather a snack.  And what a snack it is!  The taste of chocolate is rather overwhelming in some other brands, but this one was just right.  I liked that it seemed to have more of the bitterness of darker chocolate going for it, rather than the sweetness of milk chocolate.<br /><br />I will say the one drawback for me...it's hard!  As in, no one in my family wanted to use their front teeth to bite into it, choosing instead to use our stronger back teeth, but again it's granola so what did I expect?<br /><br />The price for this, if it follows the companies other flavors of granola clusters is pretty much standard for this product. $21.78 for 6 6 ounce bags. Actually, that's about $3.83 a bag, cheaper than many products on the market now.<br /><br />This is a good snack, though not one I would eat often as I mentioned I am trying to watch my weight, but my boys loved it!

review/summary: quite yummy
review/text: I will admit I'm not a regular eater of granola (and I don't count those marketed-for-kids bars I got in my lunchbox when I was a kid). However, I really like this product.<br /><br />Basically, they are small clusters (almost like small cookies) of granola and almonds, coated with a "chocolatey" (think cocoa krispies) flavor and tinged with cinnamon.<br /><br />They are not chewy or moist, but granola's not really supposed to be. But it's not like you are going to break your teeth on them or anything. I like to eat them by the handful- they are a great on-to-go kinda of snack, when you don't want to deal with crumbs or packaging. I grab a handful every few hours to munch on. I find myself eating these by the handful throughout the day when I want something sweet and crunchy but don't want to sit down to a meal, and I eat a few to fuel me up before I go for my daily swim. It's sort of replaced my bad Pretzel M&M habit, which is a very good thing.<br /><br />I suppose you could pour them into a bowl and eat them like cereal, but the cluster are a little bit large for that. They seem like a good snack food to me.<br /><br />I'll admit- for the calories and fat, I'd *rather* eat something else (I'm a big fan of chewy and moist things), but then again, who wouldn't choose a soft cookie over a cluster of granola with all natural ingredients? However, there's quite a bit of nutrition in granola, and the ingredients are really healthy, much better than you would get in some processed product on the grocery shelf.<br /><br />I LOVE the bags these come in- resealable coated paper sacks. They keep the product fresh (the seal actually RESEALS!) and are easy to grab on the go.<br /><br />I'm not a granola convert yet, but these are definitely making me re-think my aversion to granola.

review/summary: Looks like a cocoa snack
review/text: This product works best as a snack as the pieces are cut rather large. I thought it would work as a cereal, but the pieces are too big. The thing that surprised me is that it appears to be mostly a cocoa product, by the color, anyway. Looking at it, I see cocoa, but the taste does say cinnamon. Kind of a conflicted product, to me.<br /><br />The taste is not too sweet, but the crunchiness seems a bit low, almost like it is going stale. I don't think I got a stale bag, but it doesn't crunch as much as I'd like in a granola. Overall, I'm not real impressed. It's ok, but not significantly different than other granola options.

review/summary: i wouldn't
review/text: I just received my order.  Big box for 2 ounces of chocolate.  But I find it is all protected and cool inside a thermal container.  So that's why the shipping and handling cost more than the chocolates.  Okay.  Get through that and there is a little box with five little pieces of chocolate.  They must be pretty special and pretty hot I imagine.  So get a glass of water handy and pop one of the more than $5 each little pieces in the mouth.  Wait.  Those ghost chilis will kick in soon and set my mouth on fire... Right?  Nope.  Not that good a chocolate.  And no ghost chili kick.  I could get a good chocolate bar with real chili you can taste for about $1 at world market.  Oh well.  So it's all a learning experience.  I learned that the ingredients on the container actually says that somewhere in there they sprinkled some dried ghost peppers in there.  If you want to impress someone by telling them you ate ghost chili chocolate, but you can't take the heat of real chili, then this might be the way to go.  But I wouldn't waste my money.  Unfortunately there were no reviews for me.  But now you have one.  Extremely disappointed.

review/text: I love Frontier's Herbes De Provence. Love love love it. I first got it at the health food store bulk section to try and feel in love with it. Was thrilled to find it on Amazon at such a nice price and have bought it here for several years. I ran out last year and couldn't find it anywhere except in wee little bottles that don't last long and cost a ridiculous amount compared to the wonderful price per pound here. Also as I have multiple food allergies I *hate* changing brands for fear of cross contamination. I have never had a problem with Frontier so they must be conscientious in their mixing and packing of their products for which I am very grateful. This time I am ordering two extra pounds to make sure I have enough to last me until next season :) I love to put this on chicken and potatoes. Put it under the skin of chicken or turkey whole or parts or just sprinkled on skinless portions. It is awesome on potatoes. my family loves a stove top dish of chicken, potatoes, sweet potatoes and green beans (frozen are fine) sprinkled with Herbes de Provence.

review/summary: Best Cookie Ever - Vegan or Otherwise
review/text: I have been vegan for about two years. i love desserts and suffice it to say the selection of vegan offerings leaves much to be desired. These cookies are moist and chewy and not too sweet. Not too salty either as I have come across that. Not too oily. Vegan cookies can be too sweet and either too dry or too oily. There is a delicious coconut undertaste - the chocolate fools you into thinking it is milk. I like chocolate but most vegan chocolate is very dark or has a nasty rice dream aftertaste.  If I were not vegan I would eat these - no crave these. My Whole Foods cannot keep this line in stock. Crazed sweet toothed vegans periodically raid the store and buy it out. Then we are back to boring fig newtons and dark chocolate bars (mmmmmm).  Anyway - try it. I plan to buy from amazon now since I cant go too many weeks without a fix.. cheers

review/summary: Best. Cookie. EVER.
review/text: A truly superior product; I agree with all the other reviews. Delicious cookies are like the Holy Grail of packaged treats -- exponentially that much more for vegan treats -- and I've never found ones tastier than Uncle Eddies. The added bonus of organic and recognizable ingredients only sweetens the pot. And on top of it all, they're made without any harm to any living critter. Kudos to Uncle Eddie -- your incomparable product has made this vegan a customer for life.

review/summary: The Best Cookies Bar NONE!
review/text: I've been enjoying Uncle Eddie's Vegan Oatmeal Chocolate Chip + Oatmeat Raisin for years. They are the best store bought cookies I've ever had. Not too sweet, the perfect crisp/soft combination, and nothing but pure ingredients. I'm not a chocolate fan, tho find the amount of chocolate in these cookies is a perfect balance; doesn't scream chocolate, but complements the other flavors (including coconut). Fabulously delicious. Thank you U.E.!!

review/text: Oh wow, I didn't have high hopes for these (vegan desserts generally seem to be an  oxymoron) but they are phenomenal!  Moist, chewy, chocolatey and de-lish!  They taste like junk food without the lethargic feeling you get from junk food!  I am on a vegan diet with a co-worker to lose weight, and when I gave her a cookie to try, she actually did a happy dance in the office.  These will help me maintain my will power.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Uncle Eddies Vegan Oatmeal Choc. Chip Cookies...OMG!!!!
review/text: I tried these cookies for the first time today, and they were the best!!  I became a vegan a couple months ago, and am very particular about what I eat, as I am a foodie and love to cook/bake.  These cookies are perfect for those times when I don't have the time to bake my own and want to grab a quick delicious vegan cookie. The ingredients are excellent, with no processed foods. I plan to buy these cookies again, and can't wait to try other Uncle Eddies Vegan cookies.  You can find these cookies at Whole Foods in the Bay Area, as well as on Amazon.com.

review/summary: The Best Cookie Ever
review/text: I always buy Uncle Eddies Oatmeal Chocolate chip cookies. the price is high but it is worth it i believe. Dont let the word vegan turn you off because they are mouth watering and have the perfect flavor, The oatmeal and chocolate chip combine with a smoothe butter like tasta and make you want to eat an entire package in a sitting. The cookies are great warm and usually come soft, everyonce in a while you may get a bag with hard cookies but its nothing a few seconds in the microwave wont solve. By far without a doubt the best cookie ive ever eaten. I brag about them all the time and refer them to all my friends

review/summary: Dry, ok.  Where is the taste?
review/text: UPDATE<br />  A response to my review points out that perhaps you need to be 100% vegan only for months before you will enjoy the 'taste' of these cookies since you may need to change your 'taste preference'.  That limits the potential customers even more.<br />  "One has to NOT eat NONvegan for a few months, not too many prepacked foods to really begin to change their taste preferences."  wrote Mondez who has never tried these cookies.<br />==============<br />I saw these at Whole Foods but waited to read reviews first before buying.  Someone convinced me in their review<br />to buy oatmeal chocolate chip instead of plain chocolate chip.  These were dry which is ok because I like Pamelas Dark Chocolate, chocolate chop cookies which are dry but also have a deep chocolate taste to them.  But these cookies don't have a distinct taste to them-they are average in taste.  I thought they would have a great taste after reading the ingredients, maple syrup, chocolate liquor, brown rice syrup [Pamela's cookies has this too], cocoa butter.  With all that I figured these ought to taste really interesting, but no.  One person wrote they are "HOOKED" on these.  Sorry I just don't taste that.  And I like different things, I will for instance bake 'interesting' cookies maybe using less sugar and chopped fruit instead or something like that.  I guess these cookies are great if you like the mass produced kind but want organic.  What is with all the 5 Star reviews?  Maybe it is a vegan thing?  I am not a vegan but I eat all kinds of foods.<br />I ate another piece of cookie a minute before I writing this review.  I won't buy these again but I think I will try the molasses since that ought to have a strong taste to them.<br /><br />Update.<br />  An additional comment not about these but about the Peanut butter chocolate chip.  A reviewer outside Amazon<br />[ Google vegansweettooth ]says the Peanut butter chocolate chip have good taste but are "dry".  They like cookies by Alternative Baking company better.  I only point this review outside Amazon because all the Amazon reviews are 5 Stars-every one of them.  Something to think about.

review/text: This is a great korean hot pepeer powder.  It is perfect for kimchee (kimchi) or other recipes that require a nice spicy flavor but not so hot as it detracts from the primary flavor of the dish.  The only issue I have with this product is that I wish it were more finely ground which would allow you to use less while maintiainig the same level of flavor.  As with all products like this it is important to mix the product in a non-metallic bowl (preferrably glass or BPA-free plastics).  ENJOY!!!

review/summary: The Secret to wealth is to make CD's and market them to the masses
review/text: The ideas here are nothing that has not been written before. People who buy these have a closet full of other "pie in the sky" books, videos, and so forth with nothing in their bank account. They sell on their web site for $79.95, but if you look long enough at garage sales, thrift stores, and flea markets for well under $5.00. I bought my copy at a thrift store for $2.00: why? Because after someone got suckered in and listened to it they felt like a fool and anonymously gave it away. Burn your money (you will be further ahead if you burn it instead, because at least you wouldn't have wasted any time listening to it) and pay for it at any price and then come and tell me how well you did and how rich you got any time you care. Right a review on it if you think it's worth anything. So far I haven't seen any stories in the media about anyone super succeeding after buying to these. Where are the good old days when they used to sell fountain of youth water and snake oil?

review/summary: fiber goodness
review/text: As stated on the back of the box, "It's the kind of cereal that will have you dreaming about breakfast --it tastes that good."<br /><br />Well, no wonder. With 13g of sugar per serving (around 9 total per box), it's mighty sweet, although I suspect that the majority comes from the raisins. The whole grain wheat/bran flakes are lightly coated with sugar which glistens under a bright light. The clusters are tasteless, in contrast to its brother product, FiberOne Honey Clusters. They were probably added to give some contrasting texture and some crunch.<br /><br />Combined together, the overall taste is so-so, but watch out for the sugar (and portions!) if you watch what you eat. It's good to be regular.

review/summary: Tasty with lots of fiber--I recommend it
review/text: Needing to increase my daily fiber intake but not always able to ingest vegetables and whole grain breads to suffice, I looked around for a cereal to help. A couple years ago I came across Fiber One. I began with the Original Fiber One w/ Honey Clusters and was very pleased that they tasted good. When the raisin bran version of Fiber One came out, I jumped on it. With less sugar than typical raisin bran cereals and a LOT more fiber, I begin every morning with a nice bowl of this stuff. I usually add a sliced banana or fresh strawberries, but that's only because I just HAVE to have such fruit in my cereal--just an idiosyncratic thing, I guess.<br /><br />One thing to note--the typical serving that these cereals refer to when they indicate the % of RDAs is a rather small bowl. The cereal bowl I use takes way more than 4 ounces. I'd say that my cereal bowl, which is of average size, is about 6 to 8 ounces of cereal. Consequently, the % of daily fiber I get from Fiber One Raisin Bran Clusters comes to 65 to 86% of my daily needs, which is great. This one bowl of cereal provides for almost all of my daily required fiber. I can tell, too, because on days I have this, my (sorry to get rather detailed, but hey, Dr. Oz talked like this on Oprah once) bowel movements are what they're supposed to be. Without this they're more indicative of liquid slop. LOL

review/summary: Chicory Root Extract = Agony
review/text: Look up "fiber one" and "Chicory root extract", also known as inulin.<br /><br />I had a few Fiber One bars at a conference a few years ago, and I was out of commission for several days, ruining my conference.  This past week, my wife bought me the Fiber One raisin bran.  I normally eat regular Fiber One and mix it with another cereal to give it some flavor, and I've never had problems with Fiber One cereal in the past.  Not so with the raisin bran, which unlike regular Fiber One, contains chicory root extract (aka inulin).<br /><br />The stomach cramps this weekend were killing me, and I thought I had food poisoning.  It was only after reading the ingredients this morning (monday) that I realized it was the chicory root in the Fiber One raisin bran cereal.  I can't believe the FDA allows this as an ingredient.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Healthy and Tastes Great
review/text: I originally purchased a box of this cereal for a foreign exchange student we were hosting from Ukraine. He did not like the Lucky Charms, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, etc. my other kids were eating for breakfast. He also did not care for the Granola or the Post Raisin Bran I purchased.<br /><br />I ran into my youngest son's wrestling coach in the cereal aisle one afternoon, and he recommended this one. Jackpot! My temporary son loved this stuff. Come to find out, so did my husband. The flakes are crispier and have a sweet coating in comparison to the raisin bran you may be used to. It doesn't get mushy in milk for quite a long time. The fiber content is excellent, and you can find this even at my small local grocery store.<br /><br />Once I spotted this on Amazon with subscribe and save, I jumped to order it. The price at my grocery is $4.39 per box, so this was a nice little savings for us. Four boxes arrive each month right at our font door via UPS.<br /><br />I recommend giving this one a try. We all know the buzz about fiber, and this has lots of it. It also tastes really good. Not always an easy combo to find.

review/text: I am a cereal addict, and I admit that so I am kind of a cereal snob too. But I'll try anything once. This cereal was not just not very good to be blunt. I wouldn't spit it out, but I tossed the box, not even my 2 year old nephew would eat it. The flakes had a nice texture, but unfortunately actually did taste like cardboard. The raisins were good and there were actually a good number of them, but there weren't enough clusters for me to even evaluate the taste of them. If they could improve the flakes this would be a decent cereal, but that's just not the case. I'll stick to Raisin Nut Bran!

Don't for a moment believe it's a "healthy" breakfast food.  It's a children's sugar laden cereal marketed to adults--which would be okay if the cereal just marketed itself as steeped in sugar.  Stay away if you need to watch your blood sugar.  It's bad choice.

review/summary: the best raisin bran around--but it comes at a price
review/text: Fiber One Raisin Bran Clusters are, simply put, delicious. Fiber One took a great type of cereal and made it taste much, much better than the other Raisin Bran cereals out there. In addition, this cereal is truly chock full of dietary fiber. It tastes great in milk and it even makes a good snack for when you're "on the go."<br /><br />In addition, the cereal has potassium, iron and zero cholesterol. Excellent!<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, all this goodness comes at a price. There's a lot of dietary fiber; but this also contains a comparatively level of carbohydrates in each portion. Perhaps you think that 45 grams of carbs per cup is OK; and maybe it is if you don't have a diet filled with carbs the rest of your day. Compare it to Cheerios or Quaker Oats, however, and you'll see right away you can get other healthy cereals that are quite good for you with far fewer carbs and much less sugar. Oatmeal has good dietary fiber, too, although not as much as this cereal has.<br /><br />Overall, Fiber One Raisin Bran is probably the best raisin bran cereal I've ever eaten. It's great; but because of certain health issues I wouldn't actually eat this every day unless you need carbs for some reason. It's a mixed bag type of product. Eat this and enjoy it; but also switch off between this and other healthy cereals like Cheerios and Quaker Oats.

review/text: We had it set up where we had a regular monthly order of 4 boxes of the Raisin Bran Clusters delivered once a month.<br />By doing this we received a 15% discount and free delivery. It worked out it was less expensive then the local store, unless you had coupons, but it was convenient. It took me awhile to notice but after 2 months they raised the price from $15.02 per 4 boxes to $16.95 per 4 boxes. Some jump!<br />We like this cereal so much we were averaging about 15 boxes every 2 months, although we would buy at the store when we found it on sale or had coupons.<br />The reason for the bad score was not so much the cereal but the way they sucked us in on their montly delivery, then raised the price.

review/summary: Much too sweet!
review/text: The flakes are the right texture and are crisp.  The raisins are chewy and delicious. The fiber is great. However, the sweetness of the brown sugar is extremely overpowering and much too sweet.  Due to this fact, I probably will not purchase this cereal again.  Too bad General Mills ruined an otherwise good fiber cereal.

review/summary: Best cheese curls - UPDATED: overpriced and poor quality
review/text: I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag "freshness guaranteed." That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could.

review/summary: Five stars for the cheese flavored puffs
review/text: I'd give it three stars for the approximately 50% of puffs that have little or no cheese on them, and five stars for the ones that have a lot (maybe too much?). I have been eating Michael Seasons puffs and curls for at least two years and can't help but notice how their production has shifted from full-flavored to light-flavored (after which I wrote the company) to mixed-flavored. It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed. Still, because they contain at least partially organic ingredients, and because they taste so well overall, there's no other brand that beats them so I keep ordering anyway.

review/text: I had so hoped they would be close or better than Cheetos Flamin' Hot but they aren't. They were NOT past the expiration by  3 months but they did taste stale and almost flavorless even though you get a tiny after burn. I gave the rest of the case to the food shelter.

review/summary: From Awesome to Bland
review/text: My husband and I went Gluten Free earlier this year due to a health condition.  We stumbled across this product at Whole Foods and decided to try it.  These were incredible...  so cheesy and spicy!!!  So much so, we decided to buy a case on Amazon.  Once our original case was depleted, we re-ordered, and though the product looks identical, the new case contained cheese curls with little to no seasoning.  They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.  We opened each bag in the case hoping some of them would be good like the first case we purchased, but to our dismay, we ended up tossing the entire case.  We will not be buying these again.  What a letdown...

review/summary: Cheetos are out.
review/text: Michael Season's baked cheese snacks are in. I don't care if they may be inconsistent with the distribution of cheese on their product, big companies are inconsistent too. Your basketball players don't make every shot, your football players don't make every touch down. Are you whining at them or their coach? No. You deal with it, because despite the flaws, you like them. Natural Snacks LLC from Illinois is providing us with a healthier snack free from glutens and hydrogenated oils, and I'm thankful for that.

review/summary: Amazing cheeze curls
review/text: I tried many times to find a replacement for Planters Cheeze Curls (now they discontinued it). And I think that is a perfect replacement. May be not only perfect but better than original from Planters. So, there is lot of cheeze powder on it and size is right and it's so delicious that when you'll put one curl in to you mouth you will involuntarily draw the next two.<br /><br />I'll recommend it for everyone who loved old time Planters Cheeze Curls - it's good and probably better.<br /><br />P.S.: I love them so much so I order them to Russia - total cost with delivery is about 75 dollars!

review/text: I'm a secret Cheeto addict, but these baked cheese curls are even more flavorful and addictive than the original.  And they are healthier, which makes them the perfect snack. No artificial cheese flavor, excellent crispy texture and sharp cheese taste.  I'm on my third case now and will continue to order this gem of a snack.  Worth a try if you love cheese curls.

review/summary: OMG These are the Best Cheese Snacks!
review/text: I found this brand of cheese snacks at a Whole Foods store in Manhattan and I've been hooked ever since. Unfortunately, WF started carrying their own brand of cheese puffs and stopped selling Michael Season's. Thank goodness for Amazon.com!<br /><br />I like these so much that I ordered a case and had them delivered to my office. Now all my office mates are getting hooked. These taste amazing for being "lite", and they have a decent amount of fiber per serving (and relatively low fat/calories). They are all natural, and highly addictive!<br /><br />I've tried the regular variety of Michael Season's Cheese Puffs, and I do not recommend them because they're too rich. The Lite variety taste perfectly cheesey without being too buttery in flavor.<br /><br />Makes an awesome afternoon snack!
