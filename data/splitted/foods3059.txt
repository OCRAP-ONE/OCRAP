review/summary: The ultimate in cat-related hallucinogenics
review/text: They must call is "Cosmic" catnip because your cat will be so high it will feel like she's on a rocketship to the center of the Milky Way, head spinning and meowing and dropping by the 7-11 for Kitty Cheetos. If there is anything about cats that we don't understand (and I think that list could go on for a while) it's how cats go absolutely nuts for the smell of catnip. We like to sprinkle some on the floor and watch our normally stoic cat turn into a blithering high idiot, rolling around in it and getting that vacant, hollow look in her eyes like a junkie who just took a huge hit of heroin.<br /><br />If your cat doesn't respond to this catnip they're either a Buddhist Cat Monk or they're a Republican. Thankfully most cats are pretty liberal and have no problems at all snorting the Cat Ganja and letting it all out. So I would say definitely get this catnip for your darling little fluffy muffin, even if they're out of kitty college and have a real kitty job, because everybody needs to blow off some steam every now and then.

review/text: So I was browsing thru amazon looking for GoGo Squeez appleapple sauce, and the general price was around $24 for a 48 pack, so around 50cents a pack. I saw this one, and assumed it was a 12 pack of 4 (that's how all the other ones are labeled) imagine my surprise when it came, and it was literally 12 packs of applesauce for 18 dollars! That $1.50 a pack, 3x what everyone else was selling it for, and even 1.5x more than whole foods. This is a rip-off. Buy from someone else and save yourself the trouble of returning the item like I am doing now.

review/summary: Cats like it but it's not really a "diet" food
review/text: I decided to try this food for my two slightly overweight cats. They have generally resisted dry food changes before, so I was pleasantly surprised when they took to the Healthy Weight formula right away and were willing to eat it by itself within a week. Personally I didn't find the pellets' strange gray-ish color to be very appetizing, but I wasn't the one eating them so I guess it doesn't matter!<br /><br />Something to note here is that while this food may be low-calorie compared to other Wellness formulas, at 450 kcal/cup the caloric content of this food is the same or higher than many similar brands' normal formulas, such as:<br />-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X2A60">Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul Dry Cat Food for Adult Cat, Chicken Flavor, 18 Pound Bag</a> -- 367 kcal/cup<br />-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAFJ16">AvoDerm Natural Indoor Hairball Care Chicken & Herring Meal Adult Dry Cat Food</a> -- 388 kcal/cup<br />-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00494LRTQ">Nutro Natural Choice Active Health Indoor Formula Adult Dry Cat Food</a> -- 384 kcal/cup<br />-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O81FZY">Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Cats, 5.5-Pound Bag</a> -- 379 kcal/cup<br /><br />I'm not pointing this out to necessarily dissuade people from buying Wellness Healthy Weight - it's still a high-quality product and I was pleased by how well my cats liked it. That said, I know that many people choose "healthy weight" formula foods specifically because they want to slim down their cats without having to reduce portions. With this particular product, you may actually have to feed your cat a smaller amount than you did of their old food if you want them to lose weight or even to maintain their current weight. Just something to be aware of!

It is much thicker and shinier than before and she seems very happy. I don't think it is too expensive - one bag lasts our cat almost 3 months! That means you are spending less than $15 per month on food, and honestly what good Cat-Parent wouldn't spend only $0.50 per day to make sure his/her little one is getting excellent nutrition?

review/summary: Pricey but both cats lost weight
review/text: I have two overweight cats that I had been feeding EVO and Newman's Own. What I didn't realize is how many calories these brands have, especially EVO which is packed with dense protein. I tried scaling back on portions and got mewed at constantly until I caved in. I decided to try this brand since it's not filled with fillers and claimed it could help lose weight.<br /><br />At first they picked at it but within a month they ate the entire meal without complaint. They have been losing weight (now around 2 lbs each) over the past 4 months.<br /><br />Like with humans, there's no magic bullet with weight loss. We all need more excercise and better portion control. This helps me prevent overfeeding since there are less calories but more bulk. I also introduced new play toys to get them active again. The drawback is that this brand is expensive and it smells oddly of dried fruit.<br /><br />I say if you don't mind the price, give the small bag a try.

However, my big cat seems to have gotten bigger. It's hard for me to keep her from eating out of both cats bowls, so I'm at a bit of a loss. I may have to look into a different diet food, but my concern is that she will just eat the other cat's food (the one who doesn't need to be on a diet). Otherwise, they love the Wellness foods!

review/summary: not just monk fruit
review/text: I like this product, but you have to look at the ingredient list to see what you are really getting.  Despite monk fruit being prominently displayed on the front, it's actually the 3rd ingredient, behind sugar.  Now, monk fruit is sweet for it's weight, so it may be contributing a reasonable amount of the sweetness that the product has.  But the first ingredient is erythritol.  Amazon sells pure erythritol, and it is cheaper on a per ounces basis (though erythritol is not as sweet as sugar or monk fruit, but the flavor is fine).  Also the pure erythritol, obviously, contains no sugar, unlike Nectresse.  So, I like Nectresse, but I like pure erythritol even better.

review/summary: There is a lot of incorrect information in other reviews
review/text: While everyone can have their opinion, the scientific justification and logic in some of the arguments are without reason or merit.<br /><br />It is not monkfruit, it's a sweetening product which has monkfruit.  Comparing it to stevia the herb is not plausable.  Apples to apples.<br /><br />150 times sweeter than sugar is not the same as 150% sweeter than sugar.  150% is 1.5 times sweeter than sugar.  While this is a common mistake, like your vs you're, this should not be a mistake when doing an analysis or making an argument.<br /><br />The total calories is unknown and not calculable.  The listed 1 gm and &lt;1grm when it's itemized means it is non-zero.  In fact 1 gram of sugars from Erythritol is 0.2 kcals so if there is 0.1 grams, that's it's only 2 one hundredths of a single calorie (2/100th).  Calories is non-zero and less than 5 but any other attempt at calculating the calories without knowing the exact contribution between  0 &lt; x &lt; 1gm of each ingredient is guessing.<br /><br />Comparing a teaspoon of this to a teaspoon of sugar as an argument that it has significant calories makes no sense.  A serving of this is 1/4 of a teaspoon.  What's the point of using super sweet items if you do arguments based on volume.<br /><br />The added ingredients are there for volume and texture.  For the mass market, an eye dropper and instructions to attempt to get out 1 / 150th of a drop in my grandma's tea isn't a viable product model.  Even getting out 1/4 of a teaspoon is rather hard.  Ingredients are listed by weight, by law, they aren't listing it by the % sweetness the amount adds to the total product.  You are paying for a certain amount of 'sweetness', a.k.a. a 'serving'.  Would there be less issues if there were no fillers and you get 120 servings of sweetener but it comes in the size of a single sugar packet?  Get out the micro scale and the razor blades.<br /><br />Is it natural?  Let's look:<br /><br />1. Erythrytol - created from fermented sugar.  Is Vodka and whiskey natural?<br /><br />2. Sugar - even if it's GM (genetically modified) beet sugar, it's the 'granulated white stuff' 95% of American's call table sugar.  Most foods at the typical grocery store are GM.  Even the farmer's market.  Who do you think they buy their seeds from?  Monsanto.<br /><br />3. Monk fruit - Seems like there are no arguments on this being 'natural'.<br /><br />4. Molasses - By-product of making table sugar, that white stuff people see on the tables and make cookies with.<br /><br />Calories will add up and increase your blood sugar?  Only if you consume a lot...all at once.  Last I knew, people didn't sit down and eat 140 sugar packets at once.  Even then, you are looking at less of an impact on your blood sugar than 1/4th of a candy bar.  Half of those few calories is from Erythrytol, which according to Wikipedia does not have any affect on the blood sugar level.<br /><br />Pure Erythrytol is close to the same cost per '1 serving of sugar like sweetness' as this.  You just need a lot more of it.<br /><br />It's a lot of nit-picking and there's a lot more I could go over but people seem vocal over trivial things.  Does it really matter if something has 1 calorie when the whole point is that people are consuming way too much sugar and fat in their diet.  Why focus on getting 'no-fat' if the purpose is to cut calories and get to a reasonable diet.  We as a country are too obsessed on going from extreme to extreme.  I see people 300 pounds over-weight screaming at the barista about getting the non-fat milk over the 2% or the diet-coke to their 3 platter Long John Silver's meal.<br /><br />Lastly as a sweetening product, I like it.  It's has a slight fruity taste.  Cooking I have no idea but I like it in my morning coffee and tea.  I use to use 1/2 spenda packet 1/2 sugar packet but I've replaced it with a pinch of this.  I'm going to try it in my rib marinade and see how it works.<br /><br />I suggest anyone thinking about it, you can get free samples from the company, try it.  You won't die from it, look at a single slice of white bread and compare it.

review/summary: Marketing trumps Product Value
review/text: The thing that I like best about this product is the container.  It is a compact, convenient way to use loose sweetener at home rather than all of those paper packets.  The downside of the container is that measuring 1/4 tsp. can become more cumbersome and inaccurate than convenient.  As for flavor, there is little advantage over other sweeteners on the market.  Sugar is a significant ingredient along with erythritol.  This sugar alcohol has minimal impact on diabetic blood sugar levels but can cause problems for people with IBS or sensitive guts.  Other reviewers commented on the extreme sweetness but that was not my experience when using it with oatmeal.  1/4 tsp. of Nectresse was not discernable while 1 tsp. of sugar added just a touch of sweetness with no aftertaste.  This product left a decidedly unpleasant residual taste when added to coffee.  All in all there was little about Nectresse that would get me to consider buying it or to recommend it to anyone else.  I suspect that this is more about increasing sales in a sweetner saturated market than it is about providing a particularly unique product.

review/summary: Sweet start -- bad aftertaste
review/text: Nectresse is the new "non-caloric" sweetener, which is set to take on Stevia. The monk fruit, the basis of this sweetener, can be used in high-heat cooking, which Stevia cannot.<br /><br />But, read the label before you decide that this product is for you, because monk fruit is not the only ingredient. In fact, it's the third ingredient of four:<br /><br />1.  Erythrytol -- it's a sugar alcohol that's 60 to 70 percent sweeter than sugar, which occurs naturally through the fermentation of fruits. Industrially, it's fermented with glucose and a yeast. Unlike other sugar alcohols, erythrytol is less likely to cause gastric side-effects (gas and diarrhea) and it does not effect blood sugar.<br /><br />2.  Sugar<br /><br />3.  Monk fruit -- this fruit is 150% sweeter than sugar. It's derived from luo han guo, which is a Chinese gourd family.<br /><br />4.  Molasses<br /><br />While the label says this is non-caloric, note there is one gram of carbohydrates listed on the label. That's four calories per teaspoon. That's less than the 15 calories per teaspoon of sugar and Nectress should not have the same effect as sugar on your blood glucose, but it's still got calories and if you consume a lot of Nectresse, it's going to add up.<br /><br />It's debatable whether Nectresse is natural, either. Sugar comes from beets, which have been genetically modified. Also, the molasses and sugar alcohol components are suspect.<br /><br />Nectresse comes in a small plastic container with two pop-ups on the lid: one for pouring and the other for spooning. It looks like granulated sugar, the only difference is a slight peachy cast which I am guessing is from the monk fruit or the molasses.<br /><br />So--after all this explanation--how does it taste? I added Nectresse to a couple of my favorite teas to see. My initial impression was sweet--actually, much sweeter than the Stevia, which has become my go-to sweetener. A teaspoon will definitely sweeten a cup that would normally take two.<br /><br />The issue is the after-taste. It's sweet and sticky and it lingers. I rinsed my mouth out twice before that taste left.<br /><br />No thanks, I'm sticking with Stevia.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, October 2012

review/text: I received this product courtesy of Amazon Vine.  I drink a lot of iced tea (who from the south doesn't?) and I sometimes use artificial sweetener, although I prefer sugar.  Believe it or not, some people don't understand that sugar doesn't have a lot of calories:  just 16 per teaspoon.  Still, many people can't use sugar or just prefer alternatives.  At first, I thought my tea with Nectresse tasted pretty good, nice and sweet....until I got the AFTERTASTE.  I thought the aftertaste was much more prominent than other sweeteners and, judging from other reviews, I'm not the only one.  In any event, that's a non-starter for me.  Can't mess with my tea!

review/summary: Four-minus for performance, 3 for labeling
review/text: I am always trying to watch my calories and carbs, so a new sweetener sounded interesting. Currently I use Splenda, so I made a point of comparing Nectresse to Splenda.<br /><br />  Performance and Taste:<br /> Plain Nectresse : Right out of the jar it is pleasantly grainy like real sugar, much better than Splenda, and the immediate taste is very sugar-like. There is an unpleasant aftertaste, though, that is more pronounced than the aftertaste of Splenda.<br /> In hot tea and coffee: The Nectresse dissolved fine but again had a mild unpleasant aftertaste.<br /> In cold beverages:  The Nectresse did not dissolve very well in cold beverages. I even tried it in plain water, and it took a LOT of stirring and letting it sit to dissolve completely.<br /> In French toast batter:  The Nectresse worked fine in the batter. It had an aftertaste but no worse than that of most sugar-free syrups, although that is not very good.<br /> In baked custard:  Nectresse worked fine but surprisingly did not seem as sweet as I had expected.<br /> In banana pecan muffins  Since the product description says it can be used for baking,  I decided to put it to a true scientific  test. I made a batch of mini banana pecan muffins using sugar. Then I made a batch using the same recipe except I substituted Nectresse.  I typically find that artificial sweeteners in cooked items seem to get a stronger aftertaste, so I only used 2/3 as much Nectresse as they would have suggested, i.e., 2 tablespoons of Nectresse instead of � cup sugar. I then made the same recipe with Splenda, again using only 2/3 as much as recommended, � cup instead of � cup sugar. I used the same pans in the same oven at the same temperature. All of them browned to a degree, but the sugar batch browned more evenly and looked just a little bit better. They rose about the same amount, and from appearance it would be hard to tell them apart. Then I invited some friends over,  and six of us  had a blind (except to me) taste-testing. They did not know that the differences were due to different sweeteners.  All they knew was that they each had one A muffin, one B muffin, and one C muffin .(Well, they liked them enough that they  had 2 or 3 while they were "evaluating". )  No one rejected any of the muffins, and I suspect that if they were given any of them by itself they would say it was fine. However, side by side, everyone had a  slight preference for the sugar-sweetened muffin, which 2 people described as moister and with more banana flavor. Three people said the Nectresse was tougher, drier, denser, and least tasty. Only one person preferred the Nectresse to the Splenda, and several did not see a lot of difference between the two. Three people noticed a slight aftertaste with the Splenda, which  one person described as "maple-like", and two people remarked on a slight aftertaste with the Nectresse.<br />BOTTOM LINE: I'd stick with Splenda for drinks, although I would use Nectresse as a second choice.  For most people's tastes,  Splenda produced a better texture for baking, too. I imagine Nectresse would be a good choice as a topping for cereal or berries because of the texture.<br /><br />  Ingredients and "Natural" Claims:<br />I consider the label rather misleading. The front panel says "100% Natural made from Monk Fruit."  The ingredients label says,"Erythritol, sugar, monk fruit extract, molasses." I leave it to your standards whether you consider erythritol "natural". It is a sugar alcohol that has been known since 1848 and reputedly has little or no effect on blood sugar and few of the side effects  some other sugar alcohols have. It occurs in nature but is also made in the labs, and I have  no clue how the Nectresse ingredient was obtained.  I am not an expert, and the internet has many contradictory articles on Erythritol. If this matters to you, find a reputable source of information.

review/summary: Notes From a Regular Splenda User
review/text: I switched completely to Splenda over a year ago as a way to cut calories, particularly in my morning cups of coffee or evening cups of tea. I always use two packets per cup.<br /><br />I was excited to try Splenda's new Nectresse since it is calorie free, but was shocked like all the other reviewers here to find that sugar is one of the main ingredients!<br /><br />For me, I experienced no aftertaste when I tried it in hot tea.  It did have a slight aftertaste though when I tried Nectresse in my coffee this morning. It wasn't anything too bad since I drink coffee before brushing my teeth, but it was still there.<br /><br />The main perk for this product is you don't have to use as much. One teaspoon of it in my tea and in my coffee was plenty.  Since Splenda products can be a bit pricey, it's nice to feel like you are really getting the 140 servings mentioned on the label.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Yes, probably if I had a coupon or if my regular Splenda was out of stock. Seeing sugar in the list of ingredients is the biggest turn-off for me. For now, I'm content with my regular yellow pack stuff.

review/summary: Great alternative to regular Splenda, same great taste
review/text: I was admittedly nervous about trying an alternative sweetener.  I've been a Splenda user for many years, for sweetening my iced tea and other beverages.  Given that this sweetener comes from a fruit, I was worried about a fruity flavor or taste.<br /><br />Comparing the flavor, this tastes a little less sweet than Splenda, but it doesn't have the cloying aftertaste of Splenda.  I can detect a slight "dark" flavor that reminds me of raw sugar in Nectresse.  My husband and I did a blind taste test using regular Splenda and this sweetener.  We both ended up preferring Nectresse for flavor.  There is a slight amount of sugar and molasses in Nectresse that I suspect is there for flavor.  There is still a very slight aftertaste with Nectresse, but it's nowhere near what you get from other sweeteners like aspartame or Stevia.<br /><br />For texture, both Nectresse and Splenda dissolve well in iced tea and have a similar texture.  Splenda, of course, is available in several variants for baking and in tablet form for iced drinks, whereas (as of this writing) Nectresse is not.  So, I only compared powder to powder.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this contains Erythritol, which is a sugar alcohol commonly found in pears and grapes.  It doesn't typically cause digestive issues the way some sugar alcohols can do (and I didn't notice any issues from it), but it's worth knowing in case you've had issues with Erythritol in the past.<br /><br />I'm not at all qualified to speak to any health or other benefits.  However, I really like this option and would be happy to use or purchase it again.  I hope it has enough popularity to end up making it into some baked goods and other treats, as I think the flavor would work well in that environment.  I'd also love to see a Nectresse/brown sugar blend, similar to the option with Splenda.

Interestingly, one of our observations has been that it has no aftertaste, and I see that some reviewers have downgraded it due to the aftertaste.  Just goes to show you how objective taste is!  To help guide your choice, note that we are fans of Splenda and do not like Nutrasweet or Sweet'N Low, both of which seem, to us, to have an objectionable aftertaste.  There's general agreement that we would, and probably will, buy this product again.

review/summary: Another Artificial Sweetener Option for Some
review/text: Advised to cut back on my sugar consumption years ago, I STILL hover in the Pre-diabetic shadows that are not stacked in my favor.  My life long journey with artificial sweeteners is littered with little packets of pink, blue, yellow and my older relatives' little saccharine tablets.  Each having one unpleasantry or another including bad aftertaste, mouth tingles, headaches, or tummy  issues.<br /><br />I welcomed Nectresse to the party. Added it to my usual coffee with cream and iced teas. It dissolved and sweetened  nicely, but the aftertaste wasn't so pleasant. I did go to bed feeling headache-y that evening. Tried it the next day with the same results, including the headache.<br /><br />Nectresse and I are parting company. The container is cute and can be used to sprinkle, spoon or scoop the sweetener.  It's just that Nectresse needs more than cute. The formulation needs more Monk Fruit, other natural sweeteners and LESS sugar alcohol - Erythritol for me to fully enjoy it.<br /><br />This new product may work well for others, it just didn't work well enough for me.

It looked so much like real sugar that I heaped in a teaspoon into my giant glass of ice tea and that made it incredibly sweet, almost too sugary sweet.  It only take about 1/4 teaspoon to sweeten about 12 oz. of ice tea.  I can see this lasting a lot longer that the 140 servings suggested by the label. I keep thinking that there has to be a catch since this is just so perfect.  Now if they come out with ice cream and candy using this, I will be in heaven!

review/summary: Excellent No-calorie Sweetner
review/text: Taste-wise, nectresse has moved to the top of my list of no-calorie sweetners.  It's a blend of erthritol, sugar, monk fruit extract & molasses. Erthritol (erythritol), listed as the first ingredient, is a sugar alcohol that has been approved for use as a food additive in the US & much of the world.  It occurs naturally in some fruits and fermented foods & is 60-70% as sweet as table sugar, but is almost noncaloric, does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay & is less likely to cause gastric side effects than other sugar alcohols. All of the ingredients are almost noncaloric, but the suggested serving size of 1/4 tsp has virtually no calories.  I find Nectresse to provide sweetness in my tea or coffee without the unpleasant aftertaste of Stevia or Splenda.

The very first time I started to pour in in my coffee, I noticed it had a weight to the grains of sweetner - more like sugar than the other powdery products.  Also, this sweetner has a sugar-like taste.  Even though I knew it was no calorie, I had to look again before serving to my family - knowing my step dad is diabetic.  My family really liked the taste too.  My mom is now going to start buying this to season things for my step dad.  Not sure if it's any healthier than other sweetners, but it says it's made from fruit and natural - that's at least a step in the right direction.  I will definitely be buying more of this.

review/text: Nectresse is a new "zero" calorie sweetener brought to you by McNeil Nutritionals who created Splenda.<br />They are a Johnson and Johnson subsidiary .<br />Although the front of the package boasts "Made from Monk Fruit", Monk fruit is actually the 3rd ingredient.<br />The makers of Nectreesse say the additional ingredients (various forms of sugar) are added "to provide needed volume and texture".<br />To me it tastes acceptable. I often use Stevia. Many Stevia products are also mixed with other ingredients.<br />Nectresse can be used for baking, unlike Stevia.<br />I would recommend you try it and see it you like it. It's not very expensive.

review/summary: Delicious--need a little more info
review/text: Nectresse has a great flavor. I detect just a hint of molasses sweetnees, and that's a plus for me, since it tastes less artificial. Compared to all the other sweetnener I've sampled, it's the one closest in texture and flavor to real sugar.<br /><br />I do wish I had more information about what's in NECTRESSE, however. The box and company's web site don't quite give enough information about all the ingredients they've added. Yes, it's derived from natural monk fruit, but according to the product site, the monk fruit extract mixed with other natural sweeteners. So I know there are other ingredients not listed. And I want to know what those are. I get pretty sleepy if I have too many foods with a high glycemic index, so I'd like to know if those other natural sweeteners have the same glycemic impact as regular sugar. Calories are not the only consideration.<br /><br />I think Nectresse tastes better than Stevia, but I'm interested in how they stack up glycemically. Bottom line, tastes great, but I wonder what's in it.

review/summary: Worthy successor to the original
review/text: NECTRESSE Natural No Calorie Sweetener, 140 Serving Canister<br /><br />I've been using original Splenda (sucralose) since it came out years ago. "Made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar." I heard that countless times on TV. Well, I never thought it was totally accurate, but it was the best sugar free, calorie free sweetener that I ever tried. Well the time has come and the patent has run out. There are now numerous sucralose clones on the market, so the Splenda Company has brought a new product on that they can sell exclusively, for now. That is, Nectresse, a new calorie free sweetener derived from the Monk Fruit. It too is partially derived from sugar, as sugar is a listed in gradient. Still, there are no calories at least in modest quantities. It is also listed as diabetic friendly. I am most interested in the calorie count and cost, oh it needs to taste good too.<br /><br />The package that I got is the tub with a double flip lid. One side opens to reveal a large opening for using a spoon; the other has a small hole to shake some out. The measure is � tsp. of Nectresse is equal to 1 tsp. of sugar, a 4:1 ratio. So a little goes a long way, as is typical with Splenda and other products. I also received in the mail at about the same time two envelopes of Nectresse. They are not like regular Splenda envelopes. They are using a thicker lines paper, more like Splenda with Fiber. My thought on that is less shelf stability than the original Splenda. My container has an expiration date of June 2013 so my guess is about a year of shelf life, so be wary of buying too much.<br /><br />I generally use sweeteners on my morning cereal, like Shredded Wheat and Cheerios. Those have no or little sugar and I like to boost then a bit. I don't sweeten tea or coffee and I don't bake so I'll leave others to review those characteristics. I know very well what original Splenda tastes like in the cereal game. Nectresse is really nice. It has a bit of a fruit characteristic in its sweetness. It works very well with my breakfast. I had no aftertaste or other unpleasantness. I was quite pleased. My large box of Splenda is starting to run low and I definitely see myself getting Nectresse as a replacement. The Splenda website is still offering the free samples if you'd like to give it a try before committing to a jug or box. I'd advise that if you're uncertain. My feeling is I liked it a lot.

review/text: As for this tiny container holding 140 servings - I don't think so unless you light lightly flavored sweet coffee or tea. It does have the same kind of bitter taste that Stevia has - but it took a lot more to sweeten than it said it should. I don't know about Monk Fruit or what flavor of sweetness I should expect but this one pales in comparison to regular Splenda. I don't know what the advantage would be if I am giving up the sweetness I like (comparing it on a per serving basis). Since there is no articulation of this I wouldn't buy it unless there was nothing else available.

So I don't know that the ratio on the container is necessarily accurate.<br /><br />I should add that this sweetener did not upset my stomach as every other sweetener aside from stevia has. It has a slight aftertaste to me, but it's not as bad as others.

review/text: After taste, After taste, After taste. Did I say after taste? Yes, most definitely.<br /><br />The after-taste is hard to describe, and it's not like other no-calorie sweeteners that I have tried. On berries and in tea, I usually use Splenda. I tried Nectresse in place of the Splenda, both on berries and in tea. I don't care for either.<br /><br />What you need to know as a potential buyer - a lot of people don't like Splenda, but I do as I think the after taste is minimal. When mixed with just a bit of granulated sugar, Splenda seems to enhance the sugar and can but used freely as a sugar-subsitute. At least that is how I use it.<br /><br />This is not so with Nectresse. It already has a bit of sugar in it, and the combination is dreadful to my palette. So, if you don't care for the taste of Splenda, I think odds are you won't care for Nectresse. Not at all.<br /><br />Definitely try this before you buy this.

review/summary: It's fine but I still prefer Splenda
review/text: I don't consume a lot of artificial sweeteners but I do like them occasionally.  For the past several years, Splenda has been my drug of choice and while McNeil's new entry Nectresse, is fine, I see no compelling reason to switch.  Simply stated, Splenda tastes good, is readily available and has never caused me any problems<br /><br />I do like the taste of Nectresse although it doesn't seem to be quite as sweet as Splenda and it does have a slight aftertaste.  I don't find it particularly objectionable but it's definitely detectable.  A big plus for Nectresse (and for Splenda) is that it can take heat without breaking down.  You can cook with it and not alter the taste or lose the sweetness.<br /><br />Nectresse's ingredients as listed on the label are, in order: Erythritol, Sugar, Monk Fruit Extract, Molasses.  The first, erythritol, is a sugar alcohol commonly used as a zero calorie sugar substitute.  It's sweet (although not as sweet as sugar), it tastes good and most people have no trouble with it in limited quantities.  However, it has been known to cause digestive upset in some.  While it's a condition more uncomfortable than dangerous, why risk it?<br /><br /> I would certainly choose this over many other brands of artificial sweeteners but Splenda remains in first place for me.

review/summary: 1/4 tsp is OK (maybe) - but double that, and it's way too much
review/text: I had to smile at a previous review noting that what the reviewer liked best about this product is the packaging. Yes, the packaging is brilliant -- well thought out, and deftly executed in an appealing orangey-peach, or maybe a peachy orange. This is one I'll definitely recycle and re-use, after removing the product and the label.<br /><br />Ah, the label. That's the first problem. (No, actually, that's the *second* problem. Because if you're a manufacturer and you hear customers raving about the packaging rather than about the product, you know you might have a bigger problem than labeling.)<br /><br />As for the label, the information it provides appears to be accurate. Yes, a quarter-teaspoonful of Nectresse certainly provides the sweetness of a teaspoon of sugar. With that sweetness, though, comes a bit of an aftertaste -- not terrible, but present. Add a second quarter-teaspoonful to the first, however, and what you get is --for me, at least -- an undrinkable cup of coffee with a conspicuous aftertaste, a bowl of oatmeal so excessively sweet as to be off-putting. For me, the degree of aftertaste seems to depend on the food into which the Nectresse is blended: a quarter-spoonful in a 16-ounce glass of iced tea was not unpleasant. More than that, as in coffee and oatmeal, was too much for me. A quarter-teaspoon in a half-cup of high-end, strongly flavored Greek yogurt, however, changed my initial two-star rating to three; in some preparations, I could learn to like this product.<br /><br />For some users, the more disturbing aspect of the label is the ingredients list. As noted above, the second ingredient (meaning the second-largest quantity in the formulation of the product) is SUGAR; the fourth, molasses. The presence of sugar (or molasses) in any food product is, for those of us who have had gastric bypass or other digestive procedures or issues, is a red flag (try googling "dumping syndrome" if you're not sure what happens when many or most who've had gastric bypass consume sugar in even small quantities). The amount of sugar in Nectresse is said to be very small indeed, but I feel way more comfortable with Splenda's list of ingredients: maltodextrin and sucralose. While both Splenda and Nectresse are derived from sugar, I am inclined to stick with the former, which I know my body can tolerate without unhappy consequences.<br /><br />10/20/12 - After trying this product in various foods over the past couple of weeks, I've come to like it better and added a star. My earlier impressions still stand, however: used sparingly (and I do mean sparingly) and selectively, choosing those foods in which it works for me and those in which it doesn't, I've come to believe this is a worthwhile product with some promise in the marketplace. A neighbor who tried it along with me liked it a great deal, but we -- both long-time, regular users of Splenda -- wondered why Nectresse would ever replace Splenda (with its handy teaspoon-for-teaspoon equivalency to sugar) on our shelves. On the table, maybe. But in the pantry? I'm still not sure.<br /><br />Both Splenda and Nectresse come from the same manufacturer (McNeil Nutritionals).

Since Nectresse is from the makers of Splenda, I was not sure what to expect, but I ended up quite liking this product. I did not feel like it had a noticeable aftertaste, as some have stated, but I did notice that it is very sweet, so a little goes a long way. This is good news, since I think the price is rather high. It makes the difference in whether or not I would actually buy the product, and I probably would. I did try Nectresse in both herbal tea and in coffee, and I liked it in both beverages. I did not try it in a cold beverage, but noticed that it dissolved easily, and it should be fine in cold beverages, as well. When you first use the product, adjust down by at least half and see if this is the right amount of sweetness for you. I found that I was using about half of what I originally use with other sweeteners. Also, because a less can be used, the gastrointestinal problems that some have mentioned might not be a problem. I've used it a few times and have not been bothered.

review/summary: sweet - slight aftertaste
review/text: This is pretty good.  It is quite sweet, but it doesn't have that horrible diet-y aftertaste if you put it in something.  It's not as good on its own -very sweet - and it does have a bit of that aftertaste.  I put a teaspoon in my coffee, and it was way too sweet, but no bad taste after.  I had another cup with just a slight sprinkle, and it's good.  The serving size is 1/4 tsp, so don't go overboard!<br /><br />There are two openings on the top.  There is a tiny opening for pouring directly into your drink, and a very large opening if you want to scoop some out with a spoon.  That was a very good idea.<br /><br />The very first ingredient is Erythritol, which I like a lot.  I usually use that in my coffee.  It's not as sweet as sugar, but has no bad taste.  The second ingredient is sugar.  I'm not sure why that is needed.  The third ingredient is monk fruit, which I suspect is what makes this so sweet.  The last ingredient is molasses, which probably gives it a little flavor other than just sweet.<br /><br />There are no calories in 1/4 tsp, but with the sugar and molasses, I suspect that's just a matter of rounding down.  But that's still less than full sugar.  I like this.  It's too expensive for baking cookies with, but it's good for your coffee.

review/summary: Great for Hot Beverages
review/text: I have a total sweet tooth, and routinely get shocked looks when people see how much sugar I add to my tea. To the extent possible, with cold drinks, I try and use Splenda, since it dissolves quickly and evenly. However, I've never liked it for hot drinks -- that wisp of bitterness and artificial taste comes across stronger. This sweetener solves that problem, I've used it in a variety of hot teas and found it to be uniformly superior in taste to Splenda. I've tried it in cold drinks too (iced tea and iced coffee) and found it to be slightly stronger tasting than regular Splenda. So, I'm not sure I'm going to make the switch for cold drinks, but definitely for hot!<br /><br />Note: I'll admit that I have no idea what monk fruit is, and obviously I haven't researched the effects of using this stuff for twenty years. Also folks should check the label to see just exactly what else is in this besides monk fruit extract.

review/summary: Nectresse A Sweet Option
review/text: Amazon Vine sent me a container of a new product, by the makers of Splenda, called Nectresse. I have been a fan of Splenda since several members of my family were diabetic. Sugar gives me a headache, Splenda didn't. But, I personally found Splenda disappointing to bake with, and the half and half mix really was not a save for me.<br />Meanwhile, I gave up any hope of making several items, until something even better came along. Then came Nectresse, made from Monk Fruit. It is said that the Monks in Vietnam began cultivating the fruit some 800 years ago. It is naturally sweet and low calorie and is now in this wonderful new product. My husband and I tried it this morning in our tea. We don't require tea to be over sweet, but I like to take the biting edge off the brand of green tea that I buy. We both agree that the taste of this is product is full and sweet. I didn't get a headache. I can't wait to make biscotti this year. I will update this review when I am able to share that experience.<br />For now, we find Nectresse an excellent product and look forward to finding many more ways to use it.

review/text: I'm diabetic and I got this via the Amazon Vine program.<br />I would not buy it for myself because it does contain a significant amount of sugar.<br /><br />It is okay in small amounts but I used it to sweeten a cup of a delicate white tea and it had an unpleasant aftertaste which was sort of metallic.<br />The only thing I can relate it to is the taste one gets from a sliver-plated spoon where the plating has worn away.<br /><br />It should be okay to use in coffee or strong black tea and in other applications where sugar does not have to be strictly controlled.

review/summary: Looking for a "natural" sweetener?
review/text: I wanted a non-artificial sweetener to try in tea. It's the only time I use such, and hearing about the dangers of artificial additives, I gave this a try. Given I use ordinary Splenda, Nectresse seemed a fitting choice.<br /><br />The label features erythritol as the first ingredient, followed by sugar, then the advertised Monk Fruit extract, finally molasses. So, technically "real" chemicals. The label promises no calories; it advises 1/4 teaspoon equals a normal teaspoon.<br /><br />How does it look? It reminds me of Tang, if less large in its granules. How does it taste? I tried it in Lipton's Vanilla-Blackberry tea, for instance (see my review) and it was comparable. The ergonomic container deserves mention for its double lid, one side to spoon it, the other to pour it, and its low center of gravity base.<br /><br />I wonder if it comes in packets or larger canisters as well? The 140-serving container is handy sized, and I will keep it next to my tea things. This looks like a switch is in order, from the familiar yellow Splenda packs to this orange-labeled brand from the same maker.

review/text: I've tried almost every sweetner on the store shelves and I don't think there is a perfect zero calorie sweetner out there, but this comes close.  There is no bitter taste, a small amount is needed and it is zero calorie.  I use it in things (coffee, tea, etc.)  or on things (cereal, grapefruit, etc.). I haven't tried to use it for baking or cooking, so I can't comment on that.  I'll be trying it again, though.  I like the fact that it is natural and there are no chemicals in it.

review/summary: A little goes a LONG way
review/text: If I have anything to tell you about this product, it's that you should use it sparingly. The reason behind this is that it's incredibly sweet. Now normally I use two tablespoons of Splenda with my coffee, but for review reasons I only added one since I wanted to see how well it'd sweeten with less. I was able to get about the same level of sweetness with less product. This is a plus, since it means that it'll last longer. I tried it by itself and my tongue felt like it was going to fall off from how sweet it was. As this can be adjusted by using less, this wasn't that huge of an issue.<br /><br />The biggest downfall is that at the end of it all there was somewhat of a flavor to my coffee that didn't come from the beans themselves or from the creamer. I'm not sure what monk fruit tastes like, but I could definitely tell a difference from my usual plain old Splenda. Then again, I'm picky like that and this is why I tend to stick to absolutely one brand over all others because I'm funny about aftertastes. The aftertaste here isn't horrible or anything to where I'd vow never to use this akin to how I feel about Sweet and Low, but it is enough to where I'd admit that if I had a choice between Splenda regular and Nectresse, I'd choose the regular stuff. And despite what the product tells you, this doesn't taste like sugar. Not at all. This is pretty much par for the course with any alternative sweeteners, but it always irks me when it's advertised as such because very few (if any) sweeteners accomplish this. It also sort of bothers me that this is being somewhat touted as a more natural non-sugar sweetener, but it still contains a chemical in it. This isn't a deal breaker for me as hey- I use regular Splenda, but I know it will be for some.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: would I buy this on my own? Maybe. If there were some good sales and this was less than my regular stuff, I might. It's just that overall I wasn't really impressed enough to want to replace my typical Splenda with this stuff. It's good enough that I'll rate it 3 stars and I can see where some will become keen to it. It's just not impressive enough to where I'd regularly purchase it over my traditional sweeteners.

review/summary: nectresse
review/text: 'nectresse' is a no calorie sweetener from Splenda.  It has natural sweetener from fruit and other natural sweeteners. It is in bulk, not a packet.  You can control just how much you use.  The jar gives you info as to how much is equivalent to a tsp of real sugar.  The lid opens for a spoon in one side, and for a small shake on the other side.<br /><br />I used it in hot tea, cereal, (oats and unsweetened dry cereal) and it was great in all three.  I've used Splenda ever since it came out, and this is a successful product, too.  The jar specifies 140 servings which, of course, depends upon what you're sweetening.  A cup of tea or coffee would probably take less than a big bowl of cereal.<br /><br />The jar doesn't take up much room, it's about 3" at the base, and a little less than 3" tall. (It's a cheerful color, too!)<br /><br />I definitely recommend it.

review/summary: Not My Favorite
review/text: I was really intrigued with this product.  I seemed to promise a new choice is artificial sweeteners.  On the plus side it comes in a small container that has 140 serving.  On the minus side you need to measure each serving out a 1/4 teaspoons at a time so it would be easy to get fewer serving than promised.  Another minus are the ingredients.  It states that the sweetener is made from monk fruit but that is the third ingredients listed.  Sugar is listed before Monk Fruit.  That makes me wonder if there are calories when you use more that the 1/4 teaspoon.  The last minus for me was the aftertaste.  I found it very strong.  With the ingredients minus and the aftertaste minus I cannot recommend this natural No Calorie Sweetener.

review/summary: Misleading and not what you think
review/text: I'm always on the lookout for a great no-sugar sweetener, I currently like and use Ideal for white sugar substitution. I've been hearing some buzz about this 'new sweetener'. I saw Splenda on the label, and in general I'm not a real Splenda fan only because I can taste it in almost anything. But, it's a new product, why not try it? So I ordered it on Vine when I saw it was available. For the record, there is no sucralose (Splenda) in this at all.<br /><br />If I had seen this product on the shelf at the store, I would not have purchased it after picking it up and reading the label, and that is because:<br /><br />**The second ingredient is sugar. &lt;-- Yes you just read that correctly: sugar. Not something just masquerading as sugar, it's actual SUGAR sugar labeled as sugar. And then molasses as the last ingredient. Zero calories, my big Aunt Fanny. Sure, legally if it's below a certain threshold they can count it as zero on the label. BUT WHY WOULD ***YOU*** pretend there is no caloric impact, even if they will??<br /><br />The whole "all natural! No Calorie sweetener" is misleading and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I did try this in some coffee and it had a too-sweet edge, but I did use the amount I normally use of non-sugar products. If you buy this you might find it goes farther than your usual artificial sweetener of choice. It has 1 gram of carbohydrate per 1/2 tsp. serving, equal to one Splenda packet.

review/summary: Just another artticial sweetener
review/text: I had never heard of monk fruit until I saw the ad for nectresse. I'm always up for trying a natural non-caloric sweetener (like stevia).  So, I thought I'd give this a try.  Before I even opened the package, I was disappointed.  The number one ingredient is erythritol (from WikiPedia- Erythritol ((2R,3S)-butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol) is a sugar alcohol (or polyol) that has been approved for use as a food additive in the United States[1] and throughout much of the world. It was discovered in 1848 by British chemist John Stenhouse.[2] It occurs naturally in some fruits and fermented foods.[3] At the industrial level, it is produced from glucose by fermentation with a yeast, Moniliella pollinis.[1] It is 60-70% as sweet as table sugar yet it is almost noncaloric, does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay, and is partially absorbed by the body, excreted in urine and feces.)  I'm in the cosmetics industry and one thing I've realized is what you call "natural" is subjective. Erythritol is produced from glucose (a sugar) by fermentation with a yeast. You *could* call that natural.  You might not.  But, in either event, the advertising and the package says prominently "Made from Monk Fruit".  Monk Fruit (extract) is the third ingredient on the list after sugar and before molasses.  So, if this has zero calories and the second ingredient is sugar, I have to assume it's mostly erythritol. It seems the monk fruit extract is added just so they can put on the label "made from Monk Fruit".<br /><br />Now, as for the product itself.  It's fine.  It dissolves great in my hot tea.  It tastes similar to sugar (or stevia). I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it though and wouldn't consider it any more natural than other non-caloric sweeteners you might have found.

review/summary: So far so good!
review/text: Full disclosure: my doctor is one of the people responsible for bringing this product to market in the US. He had been telling me about monk-fruit based sweeteners for a few years prior to Nectresse being produced, so I was really excited to test out this sample.<br /><br />I've added this to berries and smoothies, so far, and all I can say is two thumbs up. No aftertaste, micro-granules dissolve quickly, and it's great to not be worrying about this being an artificial sweetener. Recently I thought I'd try cooking and baking with xylitol, let's just say there were mixed reactions to that. Xylitol, even in small amounts, can give you wicked bad gas. Nothing like that with Nectresse. I'm hopeful that they'll offer bulk quantities soon. Due to its concentrated sweetness, I imagine baking with it might present some logistical challenges, but if you've ever used stevia or any other non-bulking sweetener, then you already understand about that.

review/summary: Great sugar substitute!
review/text: I ordered this on a whim one day when browsing around the internet for a decent tasting sugar substitute that was a natural as possible with no aspartame or saccharin.<br /><br />After reading up and doing some research on Nectresse (which is from the makers of Splenda), I was pleased to discover that it is advertised as being 100% all natural as it's made from the extract of Monk Fruit.  Apparently, Monk Fruit use dates back to the 13th Century in which monks in China began to utilize it for its natural sweetness and its health benefits.<br /><br />With this in mind, I decided to order this on Amazon, and as soon as it arrived I decided to give it a try.  I must say that I'm impressed.  The taste is very similar to sugar, and yet only 1/4 tsp of this is equivalent to 1 tsp of sugar.<br /><br />So far, I have only used this in coffee and tea, as a topping for fresh fruit, and on oatmeal and cereal, but I have only great things to say about it in my opinion.<br /><br />According to the label this has 0 calories, 0g of fat, and 2g of carbs per serving, and this container provides 140 servings.<br /><br />Will buy again!

(The only way to drink the "Royal" tea in this set, and still have a collectible, is obviously to buy two sets -- something which, I daresay the manufacturers of this set hope you will do.)<br /><br />The "faces" on the tags of these "Royaltea Royalty Tea Bags" are all CARICATURES of the Royal people portrayed -- and they are not very complimentary caricatures, at that.  In colonial times in the USA, (and probably in England at the time, as well), "dunking" a person in and out of a pond, won a chair tied onto the edge of a pole, was either a test for witchcraft, or a civil punishment, (my knowledge of history isn't so great that I remember which.) At zny rate, the "dunking" of these tea-bags, with royally-faced tea-tags, (and perhaps, even dunking the tags themselves), is, methinks, an uncomfortable modern parallel. Thus, this "gift set" of tea RoyalTea Tea Bags, with uncomplimentary caricatures of royal faces on the tea tags, could be, I believe, a present more to the tastes(?) of anti-royalists than of pro-royalists.<br /><br />Naturally, this could also be a nifty gift just for collectors of memorabilia of this Royal Wedding, no matter what their feelings about the Royal Family.<br /><br />A while back, there was a "tempest in a tea-towel", as the Royal Family and their representatives, flatly refused to allow tea-towels commemorating the Royal Marriage to be made -- as they only want LASTING memorablia of this wedding to be produced. The decree was finally reversed.  Tea-towels commemorating the royal marriage CAN now be made, as they have been made in the past to commemorate other Royal Marriages and events.  However, these RoyalTea Royalty Bags Gift Set teabags are surely more likely not to last as long as tea-towels do; even if one DOESN'T use them to make tea, a stray drop of water can easily ruin one, or more tea-bags in this set.  If bought, and collected, it therefore should be carefully kept away from ALL water and moisture.<br /><br />So, is this ROYALTY ROYAL TEA BAGS GIFTS SET, really a ROYALTY ROYAL TEA G_A_G_S<br />GIFT SET?  Is it a tribute to the Royals, or a subtle slap in their faces?  Is it worth the money, if you are seriously into colleting Royal Memorabilia?  Is it, by it's somewhat fragile nature, a collectibe that may not last, and therefore isn't worth your money?  Or is it, that, just by that somewhat fragile nature, something that will grow in value as a collectible, because of that fragility?  Are there other Royal Collectibles of this truly momentous Royal Marriage, that may be worth more in the future, which are now selling at, or near, the same price?  I guess that, in my opinion, is something each person to decide for themselves!

review/summary: Morning Sun with Meyer's Lemons.
review/text: As soon as you rip the yellow package, all you can smell are lemons, meyer's lemons and more lemons. Wow, what a refreshing clean and cooling scent! The taste is not that far behind. Taste super lemony. I don't really taste the guayusa much but I frankly don't mind. Beautiful golden yellow tone. Doesn't get bitter like green tea or yerba mate. Definitely prefer this than lemon mate. And definitely this has all natural flavors, no fake taste at all like other brands. I love waking up to this on a super hot Summer morning with the sun shining at 5am, birds singing, with a little thirst yet still want some caffeine.. this will take care of all those needs. What a great iced tea this would make for guests I believe with some mint. ;)<br /><br />As for the caffeine? Well this does perk me up but not as strong as black tea or coffee does. Relaxes me, oddly. I would definitely buy this again but frankly, only for the lemon scent and if that's the case, I rather try Stash Meyer's Lemon tea and see if I like it like this one. Stash is amazing with it's teas!<br /><br />BTW, I just checked their website and it seems they have this Guayusa Lemon out of stock or maybe it will be discontinued? Don't know. Glad I can still find it here on Amazon so better stock up on this flavor. TRUST me, you won't regret it!

This is almost (not quite) as good as you get over there. I mix the decaf with the fulcaf...it is wonderful! (Use an expresso  maker...it is ground for use in those, not French presses.)

review/text: I've been looking for a replacement for Starbucks which is, to me, too unnecessarily bitter.  I ordered this after I saw a a reviewer mentioned the brand in a review for LavAzza.  I ordered this and the LavAzza Crema de Gusto (according to the reviews not all LavAzza lines are good).<br />Why would I pay almost $16 bucks that doesn't taste or smell as good as our office coffee which is Barnie? Because I didn't know.<br />By the way, I use the French press when preparing both kinds of coffee.  Does that make a difference?

review/text: Ordered this chocolate for a party we were having.  Taste was great and texture smooth.  It took awhile to melt it in the microwave because you have to nuke it in 40 second intervals and then knead it.  Still, better than melting chocolate chips in a double boiler and adding oil!  I realized after I bought this and paid to ship it that they carry this product at Michaels!  Oh well, saved me a trip I guess.

You microwave it right in the bag and just pour it in the fountain. The fountain flowed so well all night and had a perfect cascade down all 3 tiers. Buy it for the convenience or the taste...they're both amazing.

The chocolate melted very easily and the instructions are super easy to follow, which I was thankful for amidst the hectic party prep going on around me. Best of all, the chocolate tasted delicious!! I was going to throw out the leftover chocolate but my husband and kids begged me to save it. I put the remaining chocolate into a covered, shallow tupperware container overnight and the next day broke the chocolate into big chuncks. They munched on chocolate pieces when they had a sweet tooth until it was all gone (didn't take long). Very convenient and tastes delicious!

review/text: Thinking about this all over again makes me upset!!!!! This was an absolute disaster and EMBARRASSMENT. I bought the wilton chocolate fountain and thought I may as well use the same brand chocolate. It was so humiliating.I've never had problems with any of the sellers, but this was just horrific. I had a farewell party for one of my family members and just think of 50 people admiring the events decor and having a good time and then all of a sudden they see this fountain with clumped up look like gunk trying to tower down. Half of the fountain has no chocolate on it at all. There is no smooth running, just a gunk of chocolate glumps that looks like hundreds of clumped balls. This product should be taken off of amazon. SERIOUSLY. I read most of the reviews before I purchased product and some were similar with the same reviews however, everyone's experience is different but this was outrageous!

review/summary: Tasteless
review/text: The Badia Cilantro, 0.25-Ounce (Pack of 12) has very little taste and, what flavor there is, doesn't resemble cilantro.  It is reminiscent of a stale oregano.  This was a very disappointing purchase and I won't be buying any Badia products again.

review/summary: Comparable to Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Sauce and way cheaper!
review/text: I am a huge fan of the Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte which is a seasonal item.  I don't get to Starbucks every day and, let's face it, I'm not thrilled at shelling out $4.50 or so for their PSL.  I've been able to find listings for the Starbucks PS Sauce on auction sites, but the prices range from about $40 on up once all is said and done.  I ordered this product and it arrived quickly.  I now make my own Pumpkin Spice Lattes at home - they taste great - and I can have them every day!<br /><br />Highly recommended....
