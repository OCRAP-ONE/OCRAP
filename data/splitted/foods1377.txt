review/text: My family loves Divine brand chocolate.  We recently discovered the Dark Chocolate with Ginger and Orange.  It is wonderful.  The ginger is not overpowering and the orange is nice and tart in contrast to the dark, smooth chocolate.<br /><br />I rate 4 stars because it does contain soy lecithin (non-GM), darn it!

It could not be served in the condition in which it was received, unfortunately.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin however, the vendor did replace the item with another product of the same value, so I appreciated that.

Because it's such a small item it wasn't worth returning for a refund so I put it in the swap shop at my dump. Took a small taste before I did that - it was a little sweeter than I like a dry rub. I prefer to add sweetness with sauce.

review/summary: Twist, Plunk, Truth. Classic Device is Filled With Memories and Great Treats
review/text: Shining glass blockaded me from pleasure. I stood outside the tiny windowed box with my quarter, looking right and left. One quarter, one choice, and time ached for a decision. The brilliant red base held sternly the beautiful bounty above. That beauty, that delicate sweet joy awaiting me caused my heart to tingle. On the right, the tart sharpness of hard candies whistled silently. On the left, the slow smooth chew the highly coveted grape bubblegum balls mixed in with the cherry and orange winked knowingly. I knew what I wanted, and that was the purple gum, but dare I risk my hard-found money and instead receive the deplored pink flavor for my gamble?<br /><br />The sun flickered off the chrome top as I considered. I sunk my quarter in the left. Twist, plunk, truth. Blueberry. Next time, I thought, will surely be grape.<br /><br />A gambling man I ought never be, but this is the classic machine found across America. Solid construction, receives money easily, and returns the product quickly. May yours always deliver the best flavor, whether tart, gum or toys.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/summary: Every can was damaged - what are they trying to pull
review/text: Our dog loves this dog food. But, after my experience with ordering this product online through Amazon the dog may not get it again, as I am not only upset with Amazon for allowing it, but also the manufacturer who passes on their damaged cans to the public through an online site.  I ordered a case of this product and every can in the shipment has large dents in the can.  And because of the location of the dents, on the inside cans, in the packaging, you can tell it wasn't damage done during shipping.  These cans we packed that way. Never again will I order anything like this online.  It has actually soured me on using Amazon.

She's putting weight on at a good pace and her coat is looking wonderful.<br /><br />Let's face it, all the filler and things they put into much of the pet food available is no better than us eating Big Macs every day. It's food, we'll survive on it... but it's not the best we can have.<br /><br />Wellness Just For Puppy is a much better choice than a lot of other foods, try it out, it's your choice!<br /><br />Happy eating!

review/summary: smells like actual food
review/text: Wow. I just got a yorkie puppy, 10 weeks at the time of coming home. Breeder sent me home with mighty dog canned food. Worst smelling product I have encountered, my house and puppy stunk. I know dogs are not human, but a product that has that scent cannot possibly be good for the dog. I went to petco and got some supplies including wellness puppy treats. He loved them so much I decided to quickly switch to this dog food. No transition just fed it to him, he loves it, eats more, and has absolutely no problems. I am happy with the ingredient list. Highly recommend. Also when I first opened this I was pleasantly surprised to see actual pieces of vegetables in the can, plus it smelled kind of like tuna, much much better then the horrible smelling mystery paste before.

review/text: Well, when we got our dog Valentine as a Valentine's Day Surprise, the next day we rushed to PETCO and they told us that a healthy food would be Wellness and Blue. We got Blue dry food and Wellness canned food. Our dog ate Wellness for a month and a half, and them she didn't really want to eat it anymore, sniff and walk away. The same thing happened with Wellness treats. If your dog would eat anything I would recommend this, but if your dog is a picky eater, you should have other foods as a back up option. We ended up giving the food and treats to our neighbor and owner of Valentine's brother, and that dog will eat ANYTHING, so at least the food didn't go to waste.

review/text: I'm a big fan of gouda, and I love the smoked flavor, so this cheese was a big hit for me.  However, the cheese has a slight 'plasticied' consistency.  It's hard to explain except that it didn't melt like other normal goudas I've had in the past.  It's great for slicing up and putting on turkey sandwiches.  Also makes a nice snack when cut into small wedges.  I don't think this would go well in a fondu, unless you used it in combination with another blander type base cheese for your sauce.

review/text: For those that are gluten sensitive and without celiac disease I would skip this and go for regular oatmeal.  From what I have read regular oatmeal is just about free of gluten anyway and tastes much better!  I am gluten sensitive and regular oatmeal does not irritate me.  This oatmeal takes about twice as long as regular oatmeal to prepare, and does not seem to cook through to the same consistency either.  It comes out chewy and not as soft; the grains are very large and stay that way through cooking. I had tried different ways of cooking this oatmeal but could not ever get it the way I like.

review/summary: Popular company is edging out the Nut Free Companies
review/text: I would love it if I could buy Bob's of Red Mill Products.  Unfortunately, they process their items on non-dedicated equipment and our family is tree nut and peanut allergic as well as gluten free.  The sad thing is that this company is slowly moving the competition off the grocery store shelves and making it more and more expensive to find safe alternatives.  We buy from Gluten Free Oats� that was founded by a family who has three generations of people with celiac disease and they only do one product so no need to worry about nut contamination.  For flours, we have to buy everything online from lots of different companies now as Arrowhead Mills is all but eliminated from our healthfood store shelves.  If it wasn't for Amazon.com I don't know how I would do all this shopping. Thanks, AMAZON.COM!

review/summary: Top notch gluten free rolled oats
review/text: These oats are rolled quite thick, resulting in chewy oatmeal that takes longer to cook (10 minutes) than more conventional, thinly rolled oats.  They are my favorite because of the much more substantial texture.  However, shipping charges make local bulk purchase a much less expensive option - ask for a discount on a case purchase at your local store.

review/summary: Delicious and safe for Celiac sufferers
review/text: Let me just start off by saying I like oatmeal a little more than most people.  At my old job they had a contest to get to know your coworkers a little bit better.  They had unusual facts about people up and you had to guess who each fact was talking about.  My fact was "This person has eaten a bowel of oatmeal for breakfast every single day of the past 25 years."  For the past 10 years or so I've usually eaten another bowel as a bedtime snack as well.  Suffice to say, I've eaten of a lot of oats in my lifetime.<br /><br />Almost two years ago I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease after throwing up almost every day for six months.  Unfortunately, the only treatment is a totally gluten free diet for the rest of my life.  I wasn't too upset about that until I learned that included oatmeal as almost all oatmeal in this country is processed with the same machinery as wheat which will contaminate the safe oats.  Not wanting to break my streak I started searching for a gluten free alternative.  Thankfully, Bob's Red Mill was there for me.  I bought a bag and tested it out to make sure I could handle it better than other oatmeals out there.  Almost two years and almost 1500 bowels later, I can safely say that this stuff is perfectly safe as well as quite tasty.<br /><br />Thanks Bob, for letting my continue on my streak with my favorite breakfast!

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oats.
review/text: I have been eating package quick oatmeal for years, and lately the quantity and quality has gotten lower and lower thanks to the corporate bean counters!  After getting sick on some of this stuff, I decided to try some other kind of oatmeal to see if something else is better.  I went to Amazon's web site and found Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oats.  This does take longer to cook, but it tastes a lot better than the package quick oatmeal I have been using, and it doesn't make me sick!<br /><br />Now after saying this, I have since then found something that taste even better than Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oats, and that is Bob's Red Mill Steel Cut Oats, which is also available at Amazon. The problem with this steel cut oatmeal is that it takes a lot longer to cook than the Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oats, ( 40 minutes verses 10 minutes). If you Google "steel cut oatmeal", you will find hundreds of great recipes for steel cut oatmeal!<br /><br />Compared to package quick microwave oatmeal, I would give Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oats is FIVE STARS.<br /><br />But - I am only giving Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oats FOUR STARS because I feel that Bob's Red Mill Steel Cut Whole Grain Oats is way better, if you have the extra time to cook it.

review/summary: Mother approved!  Gluten free and delicious
review/text: For some people, gluten-free is a fad. For others, it's a way of trying to eat a little more healthfully.  For a large number of people, people with celiac disease, gluten-free is an absolute necessity. My mother is one of those people. Celiacs cannot digest gluten, which is a naturally occurring component in many grains - wheat, barley and rye among them.<br /><br />In recent years, the options for a gluten-free diet have expanded significantly, though it can still be a struggle to find great-tasting options in some food groups - breakfast cereal is one of these areas.  My mother had trouble finding a cereal that she really liked, that is until Red Mill Gluten Rolled Oats. It is not only gluten-free, but wonderfully delicious, too.<br /><br />Most oats & oatmeal are naturally free of gluten - oats do not contain gluten. Because of where many oat crops are grown (adjacent to other grains that do contain gluten) and how they are processed & packaged (in facilities that also process things like wheat), it's not so simple to label oats as gluten-free. Bob's Red Mill Rolled Oats really is. Mother approved!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/text: It's Wednesday! You know what that means? Grocery shopping, coupons, and grocery sales!<br />About every so often, Safeway puts the oatmeal 50% off and I go crazy! I stock up because the oats (Quaker or general store brand) are 2 for $6. I soon stop purchasing Safeway oatmeal because I recently discovered that gluten and wheat makes me break out like crazy. I get painful cysts and a few ton of pimples (gross I know. TMI i am sorry).<br /><br />So, I decided to go gluten free and I so happened to find Bob's Gluten Free Oatmeal as I browsed Amazon. I just cooked some oats awhile ago (1/2 c. of oats, 1 1/2 cups of water, 1 TBS of cinnamon, 1 green apple and 1 packet of Stevia. Apple pie in a bowl of oatmeal &lt;3  ).<br /><br />I never imagined there would be a difference in oatmeal. Oatmeal was oatmeal. Just like water was water. There is a HUGE difference between Quaker and Bob's oatmeal. Bob's oatmeal is thicker and has a more filling effect.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these oats. :D Cheapo oats are in the trash bin (trash day is tomorrow).<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: It turns out that I'm not terribly fond of cooking up the plain whole grain rolled oats; either I cook them too long or not enough, and I was kind of sad the first few mornings. Then I got the bright idea to toss a few cups in my mini cuisinart, and pulse for 10 seconds or so until it was a rough oat meal. I also put in a healthy amount of cinnamon. I put a 1/4 cup of the mixture on the stove with 1/2 cup of water, and it gets nice and bubbly and creamy in a couple of minutes. Then I add as much milk as I want, stir a bit more, and eat. Loads of flavor, no sugar, no gluten, just a good warm breakfast.

review/summary: Better than "regular" oatmeal!
review/text: I had stopped eating oatmeal altogether before being introduced to Bob's Red Mill GF Whole Grain, Rolled Oats. Who knew that oatmeal had gluten in it? I didn't! Though these oats do require a longer cooking time, I'd much rather wait for them to cook than wait for the horrible discomfort to go away after eating "regular" oatmeal. I especially love the texture (or bite) and the lack of sliminess. My children and husband like this oatmeal. I am so very thankful someone gave me a sample to try. I even use it in when I make buttermilk pancakes; I grind them very well first. I use 1/2 oats and 1/2 flour of choice.<br /><br />I am a subscriber for this oatmeal.

review/text: I got a pack of these to eat while I did a gluten-free experiment, and like the texture so much more than regular oatmeal that even after I determined I don't have a major gluten intolerance, I keep buying these. They don't get as gummy/starchy as other oatmeal seems to (which I actually didn't even notice until after I tried these and then tried regular oatmeal again!). Also, even though it says to cook 10-20 mins, I always cook it the same amount of time as other oatmeal -- 5 mins and let sit covered for 2 mins -- and it's perfect. Just wish it were a little less expensive.

Thank you Bob's Red Mill for taking the drastic steps needed to create a gluten free oat! I understand how you have to create an entire separate part of the mill, with machinery dedicated to the oat only, have a clean field to grow in and clean transport as well!

review/text: I have recently had to go gluten-free and it's been difficult to say the least.  Gluten sneaks in a lot of foods.  I turned to someone I trusted.  Bob's Red Mill!  I used to eat store brand quick oats.  They were okay, and they were quick and worked.  But when I wanted to go totally Gluten-Free, I bought Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain, Rolled Oats.  Although they do take a few more minutes in the microwave, they actually have such a rich wonder taste to them that my husband has actually started eating breakfast with me every morning!  A bowl of these with a little cinnamon sugar on top.  And some Oscar Meyer Center Cut Bacon (3 slices on some paper towels top and bottom of bacon in microwave for 2 minutes for total crisp bacon bliss!).  So to summarize, takes just a few minutes longer but the taste and health benefits makes this an AWESOME breakfast, lunch, dinner, whenever food :)

review/summary: Fantastic for granola - and that's actually all I use it for...
review/text: Of all the things you have to give up on a gluten-free diet, the ones that surprised me most were soy sauce and oats. That also cuts down substantially on your convenience foods. Forget about Chinese takeout, learn how to make your own (either with a gluten-free soy sauce or a substitute sauce of molasses, brown sugar, rice vinegar and corn starch).<br /><br />For oats, that means giving up my favorite breakfast - granola. And granola bars, granola bites. Forget about all the fruit bars I can't have now because of oat flour...<br /><br />So Bob's Red Mill GF Oats are very welcome in my pantry. And there's nothing so good as a bowl of homemade granola - especially with coconut flakes, almond slivers, dried cranberries or raisins, and a homemade sugar syrup.<br /><br />Yes, they're pricier. It's the testing, as well as the quality. No cracked or stale oats here.

review/summary: Best tasting oatmeal ever !!!
review/text: I have been eating this oatmeal for about a month now and have no problems - it seems to be as advertised - no gluten. I get severe stomach pains when eating anything with gluten it it and this oatmeal does not affect me at all. It is the best tasting oatmeal that I've eaten and I grew up on oatmeal, am now 69 years old. In the past I've always bought the Old Fashioned oatmeal and prefer to eat it raw with apple juice on it, cinnamon and raisins. Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free oatmeal needs to be cooked as it is straight grain that has been steel cut, not refined so it would be a little hard to eat raw. I only cook it for about 4 - 5 minutes and love it. It has a consistency that is different than store-bought oatmeal - seems to have more substance, which the store stuff must have stripped from the grain, even the old fashioned kind. I highly recommend this product to anyone that loves oatmeal, and I can only say that this is the only oatmeal that doesn't give me stomach pain.

review/summary: Would Absolutely Go Into Mourning if these EVER disappeared!
review/text: I have Celiac and have been eating these for YEARS!  Every single day I have a bowl of these Rolled GF Oats topped  with Bob's Organic Ground Flax Meal and Wild Blueberries & Cinnamon!  It is what I do for my self and health every day!<br /><br />I don't boil these.  I pour a pile in a bowl, cover with water, and "nuke" them in the microwave (1 min 30 seconds in my micro) and wait for them to start rising up in the bowl.  Then I pour the flax meal / frozen wild blue berries / cinnamon / sea salt/ and sometimes sweetener / on top and stir - and I'm off with my day!<br /><br />The quality of these rolled oats is one of the reasons I love them.  Not much "oat dust"  or small flakes - these are wonderful large whole flakes - So superior to ANYTHING I have found out there and they do not bother my stomach at all!<br /><br />I keep these stocked in my pantry!  They are the most important food "to me" in my home!

review/text: Buying these from amazon saves me almost $2 per bag over buying from a local source. We make this several times a month in our rice cooker, on the normal setting, with 5 cups (the rice cooker cup) oats, 7.5 cups of water, about 1/4 teaspoon salt. When its done season to taste. it is perfect every time!

review/summary: Great whole grain for those eating GF
review/text: My husband and I have a new-found love in these gluten-free oats.  We both have to eat gluten free and needed more whole grain in our diets.  This product makes great breakfasts as oatmeal and is perfect in grandma's cookies.  No sickness or problems after eating either!  This is a great price and I highly recommend subscribe and save. Also available by the manufacturer in 25 pound bags. (which is how I have started buying them)<br /><br />Be aware that some gluten intolerant/sensitive people still cannot eat oats.  Buy a small bag and try them before buying in bulk.

review/text: Once I found out that there was a gluten free oatmeal available, I was immediately enthralled by the idea of once again eating a normal healthy balanced breakfast. My husband and I typically eat this oatmeal 3-4 times a week, so we go through these bags very quickly. The price is great for the amount and the oatmeal tastes great with mashed bananas, a hint of ginger, cinnamon, and raisins!

review/summary: Great UPS Delivery Improvement
review/text: I have been buying and consuming Bob's Red Mill gluten free whole grain organic rolled oats in Southern California for six years and whenever I run out then I have to search around to find Bob's gluten free oatmeal. I tried other brands and always return to buying the excellent quality of Bob's Red Mill gluten free oatmeal.  The Red Mill brand .<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TXT502">Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain, Rolled Oats, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> has become a favorite of my household members and now they have stopped using sugar to sweeten their oatmeal.  So, I thought I would share this with my sister's family in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  After the UPS driver did the toss and run breaking a potted plant that survived many other delivery people since my sister moved in, we thought it was very unusual for the UPS driver to ring the doorbell to let us know the Amazon package arrived.  The USPS delivery person always rings the doorbell when delivering a package to the house.

review/text: I grew up on oatmeal in the morning. There is nothing like it on a cold winters day. The old fashioned oatmeal for me is the best, I do not like mushy oatmeal.<br />Bob's red mill gluten free oatmeal is not mushy at all, it has a good solid bite to it. Being gluten free is a plus since I may be a little sensitive.<br /><br />I love to cook this up on the stove and serve it will some kind of ground nut milk, but if you can have milk that is the better.<br />Sprinkle some sugar or honey and toss in a few raisins and or nuts, add some cinnamon on top to brighten it up and you are all set.<br />This is an excellent hardy oatmeal.

review/text: I love Amazon's subscription service!!!  I am a Celiac so finding safe, gluten free food locally is always tricky and expensive.  Now I get my core supplies automatically shipped to me at regular intervals so I'm never without! All of this convenience while saving money too, this is all good; they arrive promptly with no hassle on my part.  Bob's Red Mill GF foods are safe, for someone with a toxic allergy to wheat, barley and rye that is happiness in a package. This makes being a Celiac a lot easier.  Thank you!!!  8)  By the way, Celiac disease is easy to test for, ask your primary care physician for the simple blood test called a "Celiac Profile".  Educate yourself about this disease, it is easy to manage but when not managed does terrible damage to the body.
