review/text: Eight O'Clock makes a great cup of coffee.  I like the columbian, bokar,<br />and the decaf. I find it hard to find a good decaf coffee, Eight O'Clock is excellent - smooth and favorful. You can find this coffee in waldbaums, and Foodtown supermarkets. I am told that Super Walmart has the large bags for 10 dollars. The price on amazon is entirely too high unless there is absouloutely no where else to buy this locally. I pay 14 dollars for the large bag and stock up when there is a sale.

review/summary: So far, decent table wine for the price
review/text: Having never made wine before, we decided to give it a try, mainly because of the price of this kit. Once we purchased the wine-making equipment (fermenter, carboy, siphons, air locks, hydrometer, etc) from a home-brew supply company, we were ready to make this wine. We used Midwest Homebrewing and Winemaking Supply ([...]) for the equipment package. They have a starter kit that is reasonably priced. I would also recommend purchasing a wine thief (to take samples with) and a container to hold your samples in when testing them, in addition to an auto siphon and maybe some oak chips for this kit. All in all, we spent about $60 on the equipment we needed to use this wine kit.<br /><br />Having read reviews about this wine-kit company's wines being "watery" I decided to make 5 gallons instead of 6. Later, I read that this can be VERY tricky with kits because they are specifically tailored for that particular volume of wine. Maybe I got lucky, but our batch came out pretty good. I also added some extra tannin, a little citric acid and I soaked some oak chips in it during the final phase. I was careful to keep everything sterile (with the sterilizer that came with my equipment package- never use bleach or other household chemicals on wine equipment) and I also paid attention to the fermentation temperature, having read that two of the most important things in home winemaking are sterilization and temperature.<br /><br />I just bottled 23 bottles of this wine a couple of days ago and we drank the 1/2 bottle that was left over. It tastes like an inexpensive table wine you'd get in a restaurant in Italy or France. Nothing special, so far. However, I've read that even a few months of aging in the bottle can do wonders for these kit wines so I'm eager to see how it tastes later this year. As of bottling it was clear (no haze) and had a nice, light raspberry color to it. It was semi-dry with lots of fruit undertones; decent legs and an okay nose. There was a faint hint of oak, probably from the chips, which soaked in the carboy for about 5 days before bottling.<br /><br />All-in-all, I've paid more for wine that wasn't as good. I've already started my second batch (a Vinter's Reserve kit purchased locally) and today I started a small batch made from organic grape juice purchased at the grocery store (we'll see what happens there).<br /><br />Warning, wine making can become addictive- it's one part science, one part art. I'd recommend this kit to a beginner who doesn't want to invest the $100 in  a higher-end kit. Good luck!

review/text: This kit made an excellent red table wine, I added about 2 oz. of toasted oak chips which improved body and flavor. If your looking for a wine to consume at an early age this kit will certainly provide.  It should be noted that invert sugar is the primary ingredient, not grape juice,so this wine will lack the body often found in more expensive kits and for that reason I doubt that it will improve significantly with several years of aging. It is a great deal on a passable red table wine.<br />D

review/text: I have used several Vino Italiano wine kits, and they seem to be very similiar as far as quality is concerned. They are all a bit on the watery side if you make the full six gallons, but with the kits coming with corks, closures, and labels, you really are getting more than your money's worth. I prefer to use magnum bottles for my wines, as it makes for less work and less equipment. Using them allows me to save 15 corks and bottle closures per kit, which means I never have to buy them for my non-wine kit wines. This is just another reason that I find myself coming back to Vino Italiano. These kits are a real value, although you certainly aren't going to fool any one by telling them that this is a high dollar wine.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: This is the second Vino Italiano kit I've tried.  The first was the Barolo and so far, this one has turned out much better (granted, the Barolo was the first wine I ever made).  I modified this by only constituting up to about 5 1/4 gallons.  I also added 12oz of organic raisins, 6oz of dried blueberries, and one sliced banana.  These really did a lot to add body to the wine.  The wine has a pretty nice color, and decent "legs" as a result.  Adding banana is great because it gives some mouthfeel and legs to the wine without imparting any flavor.  I also aged it on 2oz of light toast american oak for about a month while it cleared.  Then I let it sit in the carboy for another month - bottling day was about three months from the day I started the kit, and the wine has been in bottles for two months now.  What I've ended up with is a nice, fruit forward wine, with a subtle hint of oak.  I'm pretty pleased for only two bucks a bottle.  I've been making wine for less than a year and have done a few high end kits as well.  While the Vino Italian kits are definitely not in the same class, they can produce some nice "every day" wines, or give you something to drink while your nicer wines age.  Give them a few months though, as time makes a big difference.

review/text: I have made much wine with other brands with 100% success.  The other brand was pricey but produced very good product with high alcohol content.<br /><br />I decided to try Vino Italiano which was less costly and buying from Amazon was simple.  All batches were very watery and low alcohol.  I tried to improve the batches by adding fructose, fermentation enhancers, etc. with a resulting poor finished product.<br /><br />Today I went to a local wine making store and checked the ingredients and compared them to this product.  Both products used six gallons of water but the main difference,obvioulsly reflected in the price was that the product sold by Amazon had only 1.3 gallons of grape concentrate but the other had 2.3 gallons, thus the reason for the diluted product,cheap price and fermentation problems.<br /><br />In the final analysis, barring quality of the grape concentrate, I should have used 3 gallons of water and not 6 as the directions indicated.  Also, the yeast in the last batch I made may have been inactive or old.

Here's how I do it with a red wine kit.<br /><br />White wines are treated the same only I make them to the 5 gallons, not 4; still reserving some juice concentrate.<br /><br />1. Pour off 1 1/2 cups of concentrate into a sterile Ball jar. Place this in the freezer.<br /><br />2. Make the remainder up to 4 gallons. Do primary fermentation.<br /><br />3. From primary, rack to secondary (for me that is a 3 gallon carboy and a one gallon jug) Top up with simple syrup (2 parts sugar to one part water OR up to 1/2 of your retained juice) This is where I would also add in the oak chips if I am using them.<br /><br />4. This will not finish fermenting in the 4-6 week time frame. More like 8 to 16. I rack again at about 4 to 5 weeks.Clear, stablize and de-gas.<br /><br />5. At bottling time (here is were I filter w my mini Boun-Vino)<br /><br />6. Add 1/4 teaspoon Potassium Sorbate.<br /><br />7. Pour the retained juice that has been thawed to room temp into the filtered wine before bottling.<br /><br />Yes, I know. 4 gallons from a 6 gallon kit. But believe me, it is worth the loss.<br /><br />This 4 gallon volume is still a great bargain, especially if you have an Amazon Prime membership to cut the shipping costs. It comes out so well that I have put this item on subscription to save even more.<br /><br />Considering the fact that you get both corks and shrink cap (and labels, I suppose, I like to design my own) Even 4 is gallons cheaper (bottle for bottle) than a premium kit.<br /><br />All that being said, it is still a kit with kit quality. Don't expect a great wine to come from this. But follow my method and you'll have a wine you would be proud to serve your friends.<br /><br />(An additional note: I've also done this with Amazon's Reserve du Chateau kits, but adjusting the primary fermentation to 5 gallons because of the extra 3 pounds of juice in the kit. This comes out very well).

Some easter european ignorants reviewing this product think is fresh chorizo and try to use it in paella (moreover....we never put chorizo in paella).  This chorizo will work very well as a snack along with cheese or can be utilized in meat stews to give amazing flavor.  All my American friends are addicted to it already.

review/summary: 150 parts KCl + 1 part Citric Acid = a good NaCl substitute
review/text: This Nu-Salt product is almost entirely potassium chloride (KCl) rather than table salt, which is sodium chloride (NaCl). Potassium chloride tastes more like table salt than anything else I've tried, but it does have a bit of a metallic after taste. I've fairly-well masked that, though, by mixing 150 parts of potassium chloride with one part of citric acid crystals (also called sour salt). Citric acid has a very strong lemon flavor which is so strong by itself that it's difficult to use a small enough quantity of it. By mixing a small amount of it with potassium chloride, the citric acid flavor is much diluted, which makes it much easier to use, and the potassium chloride metallic after taste essentially disappears.<br /><br />EDIT: I keep changing the ratio of KCl to citric acid. Now I appear to have settled on about 1/4 of a teaspoon of citric acid per 3 oz. shaker of Nu-Salt. I think that works out to about 72 parts KCl to one part citric acid. It's all a matter of your taste, obviously.

review/summary: A tasty, considerably healthier substitute
review/text: I'm the kind of guy who has great blood pressure and no real medical conditions -- and I'd like to keep it that way. I recently started the Atkins Nutritional Approach and I'm having great success. However, as a side effect to eating healthier, the salt (and sugar, for that matter) found in most prepared foods is becoming hard to swallow -- most places simply use too much.<br /><br />I purchased this at a local store on a whim to see if I can balance my home cooking with the high-sodium foods found outside of my home. I never tried it before because I know a lot of people have an unpleasant reaction to it, such as a bitter or metallic taste. I'm happy to say it tastes great to me. It has the same "buzz" or "bite" as salt does, you don't need to use quite as much to get the same saltiness in foods as with Sodium-Chloride, and I experience no aftertaste or metallic/bitter flavor. It also seems to bring out accompanying flavors, such as garlic, just as well as real salt does.<br /><br />The only slight problem, and the reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it doesn't have an after-taste but an "after-effect". I get a very slight feeling of tightness in my throat, like when you salivate before vomiting. It sounds a lot worse than it is, because it's a very mild effect. Salt actually does the same thing to the palate, but not as strongly as Potassium-Chloride does; for me, at least.<br /><br />Overall an excellent substitute for a more healthy lifestyle that just takes a little "getting used to".

review/summary: Love it for its unintended use
review/text: Which is for the potassium, itself. I've never used it as a salt substitute, however, although judging by the taste, you probably won't be thrilled with it unless you have a strict sodium-intake dietary restriction.<br />This stuff is just incredible in the amount of potassium it packs in such a small amount. 1/6 teaspoon will give you a whopping 530mg of potassium. Because, by law, in the US, supplements are limited to 99mg per tablet, I didn't feel like spending all that money for pills and downing a bunch of them throughout the day (3500mg being the RDA, for potassium). I have current restriction on my food intake that make it impossible to receive the RDA of Potassium the natural way, so I needed to find a different way to get it in my system. The supplements you would otherwise have to purchase (unless you had a prescription for a higher grade from your doctor) are capped at that amount (99mg) for specific reasons that you should check out on the wikipedia entry for "potassium", if you want to be sure you'll be OK.  I only take the 1/6 teaspoon at a time-4 x's a day-just to be on the safe side. I wouldn't recommend taking the whole daily allowance at one time. You'll be asking for trouble that way.  I have serious cramps in both legs at times, and while I'm unable to prevent them while I'm sleeping, as soon as I feel the crap coming on, I rush to the NuSalt, place a bit under my tongue to get it in my system immediately and then dilute the rest in water and drink it. Cramp and soreness gone. Same goes with cramps after running. The Potassium works almost instantly. An inexpensive way to supplement with potassium for those who require it. Great product. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Best of the salt substitutes
review/text: I've found Nu-Salt to be a near perfect sodium substitute. The taste is not identical to table salt but it's as close as I've found. In low/moderate quantities I seriously doubt I could tell the difference. It is a simple potassium salt, actually providing 530mg (15% DV) of potassium per serving - more than a banana. So not only are you eliminating sodium, you're also getting potassium, which lowers blood pressure (search, "potassium blood pressure"). Americans consume less than half the RDA of potassium, but by all means, if you are concerned, ask your Dr.<br /><br />IMO, this is as good as it gets. I like it.

review/text: How often can you say that a product is a better value in a SMALLER package than in a large one? Well, at $16.20 for a 12-pack of 3 oz shakers (that's about $5.40 for 12 oz of product) this product is cheaper than No Salt's larger 11 oz size for $5.75 and up. Plus, I agree with my fellow reviewers: the smaller size is more convenient for travel and dining out. The shakers close tight and can be snuck into a restaurant (or a relative's home at the holidays...!) stuffed in a pocket for use at the table. I highly recommend this product for anyone on a salt-free or low-sodium diet.

review/summary: A credible substitute for salt on selected food
review/text: Nu-Salt, which substitutes potassium for sodium, is a very satisfactory substitute for salt on many foods, but its particular use will depend on your taste. I've followed a low sodium diet for years and generally enjoy all my food without salt, even in cooking. There are a few foods, however, that cry for a salty tang: oven-fried potatoes, no-salt-added cottage cheese, salt-free vegetable juice. Judicious use of Nu-Salt really adds to these foods. I don't use it on vegetables or in baking. Family members enjoy it on different foods, but we all like it.<br />The flavor of Nu-Salt is salty with a touch of bitterness, not that different from salt. Try it in small amounts on several foods to make your own decision. The oven-fries are great!<br />If you're on medication or under a doctor's care, it's important that you don't use salt substitutes without checking. Very important.<br />All in all, I think Nu-Salt is a fine product.

review/summary: Warning - Low Salt Substitutes are NOT always a Safe substitute for Table Salt
review/text: Nu-Salt is not necessarily a safe substitute for table salt and anyone considering using it should FIRST consult with their physician. Nu-Salt, in fact, could make matters worse for some people on a salt restricted diet! Nu-Salt substitutes one salt for another salt. Table salt is sodium chloride and Nu-Salt substitutes that for potassium chloride.<br /><br />Now here is what the Cleveland Clinic says about this type of product (Mayo and Cleveland are generally considered the top two health organizations in the USA): "Salt substitutes are NOT a healthful option for EVERYONE. Many salt substitutes contain potassium chloride in place of sodium chloride. Potassium consumed in excess may be harmful for some people ... a salt substitute containing potassium chloride is an acceptable alternative in moderation, if you do NOT HAVE kidney problems and have checked with your physician to be sure it will not interact with any of your medications"<br /><br />Additional research found statements like this: "salt substitutes are low-sodium alternatives designed to taste similar. They usually contain mostly potassium chloride, whose toxicity is approximately equal to that of table salt in a healthy person ....However, various diseases and medications may decrease the body's excretion of potassium, thereby increasing the risk of potentially FATAL hyperkalemia. People with kidney failure, heart failure or diabetes should NOT use salt substitutes without medical advice. A manufacturer, Lo Salt, has issued an advisory statement"<br /><br />Note the reference to kidney problems, diabetes and heart failure - the three groups of people most likely to be in need of reducing their salt intake. The likelihood that this product will interact with some typical blood pressure medications is fairly high. The warning about this product possibly interacting with medications should NOT be ignored.<br /><br />I'll conclude with a direct quote from the Nu-Salt web site: "Please consult with your physician before using Nu-Salt."<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this product unless you have consulted with your physician first! It clearly takes a physician or other health care professional to decide whether this is a suitable alternative to table salt on an individual basis.

review/summary: disgusting, but can be used as "filler" or to spike your existing salt
review/text: I gave the product itself a 3 star review because it is exactly what it claims it is, 100% potassium chloride - it comes reasonably boxed and the shaker is just... well its a shaker and it works.<br />HOWEVER<br />This is NOT a perfectly acceptable salt replacement as it is, not in a longshot. The "metallic taste" is an understatement.<br />This tastes absolutely nothing like salt to me, not even a little. What I taste reminds me of when I am using grinding wheels in the workshop and get the metal dust in my mouth... Not even salty metal dust. The metallic taste IS the taste, and it's aweful.<br />You can use this to spike regular salt as filler, maybe up to 50/50 but probably less... but do not expect to purchase this as something you can just get used to or as something that will be "good enough"<br /><br />This is a great value oz to oz on amazon at it's current selling price, but plan on using it with other ingredients. I needed to increase my potassium intake on a ketosis diet so this worked as way to sneak some in and it is much cheaper than pills.

review/text: I'm hoping this tastes better over time. There is definitely a metallic aftertaste. It is strong. Like "maybe I just ingested something I shouldn't have" strong. The effect is lessened when combined with other spices. I used a no salt blend (Kirkland brand) and added Nu Salt to give the blend a little more salty flavor. It worked OK, but not as tasty as I had hoped. I'll likely try out other similar products. If they all taste like this, then I'll just use it sparingly with heavy doses of other spices. It is definitely worth it to try to find tasty lower sodium options. Salt kills.

I pan fried some eggs with a touch of this oil and instead of the neutral flavor of grape seed oil which doesn't change the flavor of the eggs,  I could taste this oil and it tasted a bit fishy like Canoloa oil or some "off" vegetable oil.  With all of the differences in international standards for Extra Virgin olive oil,  I'm convinced this is a blend of refined oils some of which are Canola (rapeseed oil) rather than grape seed oil. I don't believe grape seed oil is as well regulated as olive oil. I do not blame the distributor as much as the processor but either way I'm returning it.  I also received a batch as a gift but I'm not able to return that since it is food so I'll try to make soap with it and see how it goes.  I don't think any of the other reviewers used this oil for consumption.

review/summary: Best Buy for Buck
review/text: I have bought this oil a while back and as many of you, I assume, have been drawn in by the quantity and the price. I read the reviews and was not sure what to think. It seemed that people had their doubts whether it was pure grape seed oil or whether it was pressed in a certain way.... let me tell you this much: Grape seed oil has a lot of uses from cooking to massage oil and even hair treatment (just Google it). Granted this is not like the other smaller quantities that are in glass bottles and certified organic and what have you.... this product comes in a plastic jug with a simple label. I can highly recommend it and I hope you enjoy it!

review/summary: Chef Paul Prudhomme's Blackened Steak Magic Is THE BEST Steak Rub EVER!
review/text: PERFECT CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY GIFT For Your Griller:<br />If your husband, dad, brother, uncle, cousin or boyfriend is the GRILLING BBQ sort, this is an excellent gift to introduce him (or yourself, g'head) to the yummy joys of Chef Prudhomme Blackened Steak Magic. You might have to backorder it, because I think we bought them out when we stocked up!  I don't know about you, but a bunch of the men in my family and my life have often been challenging to shop for a suitable holiday gift for them.  Yeah, short of purchasing a $100K sports car for them....  But almost every guy I know loves meat and loves to grill, even if it is just in their own bachelor kitchen.<br /><br />OK, so yes, I'm a fan.<br /><br />What you have to know is that before, I used to be a steak purest.  Salt and freshly ground pepper only please thank you.  I nearly didn't even TRY a TASTE of the steak when my sister first introduced me to Chef Paul Prudhomme's Blackened Steak Magic.  However, once I did, I absolutely love and adore it.  It tastes SO yummy on a steak.<br /><br />I see a number of the other reviewers here like it on burgers, so I will have to try that now that we have PLENTY!<br /><br />It used to be easy to find Chef Paul Prudhomme's Blackened Steak Magic at the grocery store.<br /><br />But not anymore.<br /><br />If they carry any of Chef Paul Prudhomme's Blackened rubs, they don't carry the Blackened Steak rub.  This is very annoying.  I also had to double check to be careful when I purchased the 2 canister vats of the rub that I was indeed ordering the CORRECT rub.  The purple label.<br /><br />OK, in case you haven't read the suggestion on the package, one of the ways that Chef Paul Prudhomme himself recommends that you enjoy this is to deglaze the pan with, yes, heavy cream.  So you might want to have that in the house.  I cannot even make the appropriate stuffing the food into my mouth enjoyments sounds in text to convey to you how yummy that option is.  It makes a very nice sauce for the steak on top of the nice encrustation that occurs when you cook it in a pan.  Use the pan to catch all the drippings for the best deglazing.  Still fabulous alternatively when you are summer grilling outdoors.<br /><br />If you don't happen to have heavy cream in the house, then half-and-half which you might have on hand for your coffee is a good second best.<br /><br />Our kitchen is very small with poor ventilation.  Definitely turn on the fan and open a window when you're cooking because as with all dry rub spices hitting the pan or the fire, it creates smoke.  Since we now have plenty of the Blackened Steak Magic rub around the house, we've started to experiment with using it with other beef moments.  It's really good mixed in with ground beef and a little minced yellow or white onion for grilling your burgers.  We've found that the Steak Magic tends to char if you have it on a very high flame, so I'd recommend using a low flame to let it cook more slowly to avoid that.  Then it just becomes lightly blackened on the outside and is fantastically yummy.<br /><br />Don't stint on the heavy cream.  The deglazed pan drippings and rub make a LOVELY yummy sauce good on Fauxtatoes (pureed cauliflower (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031231521X">The South Beach Diet: The Delicious, Doctor-Designed, Foolproof Plan for Fast and Healthy Weight Loss</a>) or on real honest to goodness mash potatoes.  Or anything that would hold sauce.  Like roofing shingles even, lol.

review/text: I love Paul Prudhomme's product and was raised on them. While I always try to maintain a stock of his vegetable and poultry magic, it's his blacked redfish and steak magic that really gets me.<br /><br />I use steak magic just like redfish magic - I skip the dredging and high heat (see my redfish magic review) and I love it.  This is one of the only three ways I find acceptable to cook a steak (the other two are smoking it, or just plain salt and peppers).  I've tried other steak seasoning blends and this is my fave.

review/text: The 2 pack/20oz Chef Paul seasoning is really a lot so I gave one to my sister. You should intend to use it as a meat rub and let it marinate your steaks for 24 hours but I usually have some at the table too because it will come off during BBQing. Great value as it costs about $1/oz in the grocery store.

Also, the<br />smaller 1.8 oz. bottle (if you can get it) costs about $4.00 retail, making this<br />20 oz. container quite a cost saver. I would highly recommend it for anyone who<br />does alot of grilling. You won't be disappointed. The blackened redfish magic is<br />excellent as well.

They stopped selling it at the local Ralph's and we were going through it so fast. You should use A LOT when you use it. Cake it on and push/dab it in to the steak (do not rub). It will blacken the steak but adds some amazing flavor!

Mix it in your hamburger. Top off your bacon. It's really great for making anything "blackened", though beware that process produces a lot of smoke, I wouldn't suggest doing it inside.

I tried it cold and toasted and neither way tasted good. This was oddly flavored and unlike any real jerky that I have ever eaten. I threw it out. I will say it was tender but I think the fish sauce may have something to do with that.

Cento amd Rolands. Both have a mild sweeter flavor and aroma and less salty . These are close to the ITalian anchiovy that I prefer.<br /><br />Rolands is not sold in smaller tins.You see once you open the anchiovy in the big tim , you have to put the rest  it in a glass container with lots of olive oil and  vacuum  it.Or else it will change in flavor and spoil faster.<br /><br />Well I  dont have a vacuum container so I chose Cento instead.It comes in small tin and Its from Morocco.<br /><br />I am glad Amazon sells it and I  love the subscription so I dont have to worry about running out.

They cook down nicely into tomato sauces & fish soup or stew. If you like anchovy more than I do you might really like these. I think the price is a little high. Good thing I am not overly fond of these.

review/summary: Wonderful Quick Food
review/text: Love these because you can store the box in a cupboard -- no wasted refrigerator space -- and still have a good / quick meal ingredient.<br /><br />My husband loves these as a light lunch or evening side dish served with butter and grated cheese. I love them in soup, especially a simple chicken broth soup -- to which I add a bit of black pepper, dill, and lemon juice.<br /><br />The DaVinci tortellini are aso great.

review/summary: it was OK.
review/text: After reading previous reveiws on this product I was more than excited to try it. I love Italian food and this seemed like a great fast meal option for me. I followed the directions as indicated on the box and even after 15 minutes they were still a little hard. The color of the cheese inside the pasta looked a borwnish orange color and I was expecting white since it supposedly contains parmesan cheese. Not to mention that it didn't taste like parmesan cheese. I wouldn't buy it again.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: To be honest I like these more the fresh kind made by Buitoni--they just have more flavor. And the fact that they can be stored for over a year is a plus. I can say for certain that if I bought twelve boxes of this I'd be able to eat it all by myself in less than a month.

review/summary: Very good.
review/text: This is a terrific alternative to plain pasta & is easy to keep since the uncooked product doesn't require refrigeration. The ravioletti are even better the next day ( we put a little butter on them before putting in the fridge, and just have them cold the next day) I will definitely keep buying these!

review/summary: Fabulous pantry option!!
review/text: OK, so you know how you buy those wonderful-looking ravioli in the deli-case, sure they'll make a wonderful meal this week, except, well, life happens, and by 2 weeks from now you haven't even gotten around to them and have to throw them out?<br /><br />Thanks to the previous reviewer, whose assurances we took on faith, we gambled and bought a whole case of these, sight unseen (later we found them at our local supermarket, same size, same brand, but higher price).<br /><br />Turns out, they're delicious!  My very picky husband raved about them last night.  And we both love the fact that we have a luscious, simple meal on hand -- IN THE PANTRY!  No more crowding of the refrigerator, no more throwing out expired delicacies.<br /><br />If you ever stop to eat on the way home from work because you're too tired to cook anything complicated and you're not sure what's still fresh in the fridge, hurry:  order yourself up a case of these, and I'll bet you'll have that problem solved twice a week!<br /><br />Tip:  for a gourmet, restaurant-quality sauce that's even faster and that, like this, stays in the pantry until you need it, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012HP1CC">Bertolli Premium Pasta Sauce, Summer Crushed Tomato & Basil, 13.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a> -- microwaves in its own pouch in 90 seconds.  NINETY SECONDS!  NO POT!  Tastes "10 times better than the fresh tomato sauce in the deli case", says my husband.  Makes the ravioletti into a gourmet dish too.<br /><br />Bet you didn't know you could put a gourmet dinner on the table in less than 20 minutes with only 1 pot -- the one to boil the pasta!  :)  And at only about $4 for two of you (no, both the pasta and sauce say they feed 3 people, and they both exaggerate -- count on 2), it's still a steal.  Compared to what you would have spent at the cheapest fast-food or take-out place?  And with only 1 pot (use one with a strainer built in, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5BIDE">Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 3-Quart Cook and Pour Saucepan with Cover</a>, so you don't even have to use a separate strainer!) plus 2 bowls plus 2 large spoons to wash, well, I don't think it gets much better than this!  :)

review/text: a most wonderful blend, had drunk it for years while traveling in the far east and wondered why it is not available in the US stores.  Thank God for amazon, I buy 6 boxes at a time.  Never tire of the taste, great with sugar or artificial sweeteners
