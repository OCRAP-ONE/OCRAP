review/summary: Not what I expected.
review/text: The taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed. Some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all. I bought a box of these so I tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes. All in all I will stick with the ready to go variety offered by Frito Lay and Mission.

review/summary: Lawrey's Microwave Pork rinds review
review/text: The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.

review/summary: Tasted Like Ammonia!
review/text: So I made one bag of these pork rinds & it came out good! I decided to try another & the taste was unbelievable - it had an ammoniated taste & smell to it! I thought that maybe it was a bad bag. I stayed away for a few weeks & decided to give them another try. BAD IDEA! They tasted like ammonia again! This wasn't caused by incorrect cooking time because they all came out looking puffy, and crispy. I ended up throwing the box out.

review/summary: NOT EDIBLE - MSG - EXCESSIVE SALT
review/text: A warning should be placed on the item description because this product contains Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), a dangerous excitotoxin which is problematic for many people. There is no indication in the item description that this is the case. I fully agree with another reviewer that this item also is so extremely salty that it cannot be consumed. The MSG also heightens the very salty taste. This item did puff up very nicely in the microwave, but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all 18 packages had to be thrown out. For that reason, I am surprised at the many excellent reviews of this product. Amazon.com gets an A+++ for their wonderful handling of this problem.

review/text: I tried to "cook" 6 different bags of these.  Only a fraction of product "popped up".  The ones that managed to pop tasted overly salty and had an unusual flavor.  Unfortunately, they were not returnable, so the rest will be going to the trash.  Waste of $$$.

review/summary: High MSG content, but otherwise a great low carb/fat snack
review/text: I was surprised at how well the rinds "popped," and didn't have any difficulties as other reviewers did.  I made sure that I unfolded the package (it's folded into three just like a microwave popcorn pack), unbent the folds so that the product could move between the three areas, then I shook it vigorously several times, trying to distribute the contents somewhat evenly throughout the bag.  Two minutes in my microwave (1100 Watts, but 10 years old) is perfect, and virtually all rinds pop every time.<br /><br />This is a low fat product, so it isn't nearly as tasty as the supermarket pork rinds you may have tried.  One could easily eat an entire package, although there are three servings per bag, but you will pay the consequences in terms of salt intake and MSG overload.  The MSG triggered a migraine for me, so now I don't eat it frequently, and make sure I only consume half a bag at most.  When I get near the bottom of the bag, where the most salt and MSG ends up, I try to brush off as much as I can.<br /><br />Still, a good snack option for those with blood sugar sensitivities.  Zero carbs is always good! The only reason for my 4 star review is that the amount of MSG per bag seems to be pretty high, and that's not disclosed on the product's Amazon page.

review/text: I ordered this product - Lowry's Pork Rind - and received it promptly - within two days.  I have not been able to pop one bag!  They all stay flat - nothing works.  My microwave is not the problem as I cook lots of other things in it.  Looks to me that the product is not longer any good, by the comments.  They may have started out great, but it NO LONGER IS WORTH BUYING!

review/summary: Love these, but they don't love me
review/text: I bought these on another online site and the Amazon ones are almost $3 cheaper. I love these. In fact, I've grown quite addicted. Unfortunatley, they have tons of sodium and also contain MSG, which is causing me to gain a lb or two of water weight and stalls my weight loss progress very effectively. If I were only trying to maintain, these wouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />I won't buy them again, for these reasons.

review/text: I bought these last month as part of an Amazon promotion - buy 5 items get %40 percent off.  I had never heard of this product, but have a soft spot in my belly for the snacks I grew up on as a kid.  These things turned out way better than expected.  They are essentially pork rinds from your typical supermarket, but they are fresh - still crackling and popping after you open the bag.  I'm addicted to these now and have had to ratio them out so I don't eat them every night.  They're THAT good.

review/summary: great product, bad design
review/text: The product itself is great, it's the bag that needs work.  I recommend that instead of microwaving them in the bag, spread them out on a paper plate or a microwave safe plate then popping them in the microwave for about 90 seconds.  You do have to watch these cook though or they will burn on you. I really like the pork rinds themselves and they are a healthy alternative to chips though they are a little salty.

They popped perfectly, tasted delicious (crunchy, not too hard, not too spicy, not too salty) and are a really healthy snack.<br /><br />ZERO GRAMS saturated fat.  Total protein per bag:  31.5 grams.  Total calories per bag:  210<br /><br />Within minutes of tasting them, I ordered an 18-pack.  These things fall into the "Totally Awesome" pile, for sure.<br /><br />If you like pork rinds and eating low-fat, high-protein snacks, this item might work out well for you.

review/summary: I LIKE 'em
review/text: I like them a lot. Got a batch after seeing it on a TV show. The first bag seemed a little 'off' to me, but then I realized it was bacause they were not fried. After that I like them a lot. I think they could be 'hotter'. I found that you want to start at the low end of the cooking time and work up. For me about 3 bags was enough to figure out that 1:08 was the 'perfect' time for my microwave. Long enough that they all 'pop' but not so long that anything happens to the early 'poppers'.<br /><br />My daughter loves them also, and we are going through them at a pretty good clip. I'm going to put them on auto reorder when this batch is gone. They are perfect for evening snacking when the mood hits. Since you make them as you eat them, never a stale bag! And the size is just about perfect for that.<br /><br />That's my 2 cents worth :)

review/summary: You have to be really desperate
review/text: After reading all the positive reviews, I was really looking forward to finally getting a very low carb (somewhat low calorie) snack that I can work into my low carb living.  I've had pork rinds from the stores and thought they were pretty good, so I expected this to be at or better than my local convenience store brand.  Wrong.  I was first disappointed with the texture.  After following the instructions to microwave from 1-2 minutes, some (about 1/4) were crispy, but the rest were almost like taffy and would stick to the teeth?  Perhaps I didn't cook long enough, so 2nd bag stayed in longer which made a few more crispy, but more burnt and chewy ones.  But texture is only 1/2 the problem, the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag. The taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste.  Finally,those without the full paper bag taste didn't really have a lot of flavor.  They were salty (which is to be expected),but that's really all the flavor you get.  So if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store (or can't find any in a near by store), this may work for you.  It  works out to about $1.00 a bag, so I'm not totally disappointed as my dog loves them.  By the way, my dog gives them 5 stars.

review/text: Being a gluten sensitive individual, I was lured into a false sense of security when I read the simple ingredients on this Amazon info page.<br /><br />Because I didn't first do my homework, and read the labels before I began consuming these, I ended up having a massive asthma attack.  Just wanted to let everyone who has these sensitivities/allergies to avoid this product.

review/summary: i REALLY didnt want to like these
review/text: my husband loves pork rinds, i however was freaked even thinking about "deep friend pork skin" but i am always willing to try new things so over the years i have choked down countless brands of pork rinds to appease my husband.<br /><br />one day i was at work (at a hotel) and i notice over on the snacks for sale shelf microwaveable pork rinds. i was like WTF you gotta be kidding me, so being the good wife i am i buy them (more as a joke than anything else) for my husband well he zapped them bad boys and started happily munching away, oohing and ahhhing over how good they were, so i tried one (i refused to tell him that it was pretty good)..over time i bought him more, even ordering them thru the hotel (ya employee discount!!) and he noticed that i would ever so casually walk by and snatch one from his bag. finally i gave up and just made myself a bag. i am now hopelessly addicted however no longer work for the hotel so i needed a new supplier....lol<br /><br />our microwave has a popcorn button, on a whim i gave it a shot figuring it would be a microwave disaster, much to my surprise i got PERFECT bags of porky crunchy goodness EVERY TIME, and when i say perfect i mean not one single under done or burn piece. for the life of me i cant figure out HOW the microwave can use the same button to make popcorn and the pork rinds so perfectly. but i chalk it up to magic<br /><br />be forewarned if you have dogs.....these are doggy crack, (yes i know...don't give the dogs people food...yadda yadda) i am convinced if you waved one of these little buggers in front of your dog and told him to speak, he wouldn't bark, he would recite Shakespeare. i have never seen my dogs go that crazy over ANYTHING else

review/summary: If Popcorn and Bacon Had a Baby
review/text: My day had been nothing exceptional.  I had forgotten to take lunch and the afternoon was dragging.  Upon returning to my desk I saw a bag of these on my desk that had been here for a few days; a gift from a friend.  I decided to take them to the microwave and give them a try.  I fully expected to "pop" them and open the door to the worst smell I could fathom.  Imagine my surprise when the bell dinged and I opened the door to the delicious smell of still sizzling savoriness that is Lowrey's How n Spicy Bacon Curls.  It was like cherubim descended from heaven and placed God's favorite snack in my mouth.  I was bathed in a pillar of light and from nowhere the volume rose to a crescendo of Beethoven's 9th Symphony.  At that moment I realized that my life had been building to this moment ... this one perfect instant in time.  I felt as if my tongue was nodding in approval and I shed a single tear of joy.  If I have another son I will name him Lowrey.

review/summary: Love These!
review/text: We really love this product.  Many times we have bought pork rinds from the store and have had to toss them out because they were no longer fresh.  But Lowrey's Microwave Pork Rinds are made fresh each time you microwave a bag. It's amazing how much the 1.75 ounce bag makes - more than enough to share.  If I have a complaint, it's that they are a bit salty.  My husband & I have remedied that by adding them to our popcorn (we pop on the stove), then the salt is dispersed into the popcorn. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K3LQ1E">Lowrey's Bacon Curls, Microwave Pork Rinds (18 Bags, Original 1 case</a>

The aroma from the microwave during the cooking process is heavenly. Be sure to shake the bag per package direction. A must for the pork rind addict.

review/text: I'm currently deployed and I'm on a low carb and high protein diet.  But my current location doesn't allow me to go out into town easily to get the type of foods that would keep me on my diet. So i ordered this from amazon.<br /><br />Pros<br />fast shipping!<br />taste great<br />Zero carbs<br /><br />cons<br />does make the room smell once you open the package<br />so be mindful of anybody else who might complain. just open it outside, through a window, or stand under a ventilation fan.<br /><br />I've read reviews of people have trouble cooking it. here's my method.<br /><br />-the instructions says cook for 2 minutes, but i set it to 3 minutes.<br />-after 45 seconds I open the door flip the package and shake it to spread the pieces out again<br />-after another 45 seconds i flip the package one more time and help the bag expand by just shaking the pieces around.<br />-then I'll let cook for about a total time of 2:10-2:20 then stop and open the bag and place the rinds in a bowl or container.<br /><br />I'll then look through to see if any have not expanded yet. I'll just throw them in the microwave without the bag on a plate or napkin and just let them cook for a minute.<br /><br />there, you are done!<br /><br />i like to dip them in hot sauce. ENJOY!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: These pork rinds are delicious, but learning how to cook them in your microwave takes some practice. My first 2 bags were wasted, but I finally just dumped the bag on a paper plate and microwaved it and they turned out GREAT.  The bag has NOTHING to do with the cooking, so I actually just emptied all of my bags into one big ziplock bag so I can put how many I want on a plate and only cook a few at a time (cooks better that way)<br /><br />All that said, when these babies puff, they are delicious.

review/summary: Wonderful pork rinds. Microwave with care!
review/text: I first tried Lowrey's Bacon Curls when they were offered at a local club store. Since then, the only way to find them had been to order them streight from the manufacturer, until now. I'd had mixed results with the microwave process. I'd had many bags just burn without popping. Recently...just for fun, I thought I'd see what would happen if I tried lower wattage. It worked!! Now I use my 900 watt microwave vs the 1100 watt microvave I'd initially used.

review/text: This is my fourth order of these pork rinds and I'm not sure what's up, but something's really amiss.  The bags are leaking some kind of grease and don't fluff up during the microwave process.  I used to love these, so hopefully this is just a bad batch.  If not, then Lowrey's needs to look into this and fix whatever has happened to a once great snack.

review/text: It cooks in microwave so fast, and it's really good right after you cook, but unfortunately it has MSG in it. Nonetheless, the fat and sodium content on this is not too bad when compared to regular pork rinds. I uploaded a photo of the nutrition facts so you can see the ingredients too.

review/summary: BAD BATCH
review/text: This was my second purchase of this product. The first purchase was great, but this 2nd must have been a defective batch. Most packs did not cook correctly because they were not sealed tight and opened during cooking. That caused them to burn or not cook completely. I did not send them back because I kept thinking, maybe the next one will be better, but I was wrong. There are a few packs left, but I'm hesitant about microwaving them. I will probably purchase some again, but it will not be anytime soon.

review/summary: Lowrey's Bacon Curls--Microwave
review/text: I love these things.  I used to be able to get them at Wal Mart and a couple local grocery stores.  Now I have a hard time finding them--but they are available through Amazon.  I like all kinds of Pork Rinds--but most of the ones you buy in the store--already made--have a high fat content.  People on a low carb diet can eat any kind--but if you are watching your fat intake, these are an excellent alternative.  I always include them in my diet--they are not the most filling snack--however, a bag usually satisfies your craving for a salty snack.  I buy boxes of them at a time from Amazon so I never run out.

review/summary: I eat these too much
review/text: I'm kind of addicted to these.  I like both the Hot and Spicy and the Plain Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds, but like the Hot and Spicy best.  I found the perfect time in my microwave of 1:20, but had to experiment to find the right amount of time.  Before taking them out of the plastic I shake them a little.  Once in a while they will fly out of the bag when I try to shake it when the bag is out of the plastic and opened flat like the directions show.  You really need to get them dispersed in the bag before popping if you want full big puffy pork rinds, which I think needs to be done more than 5-6 times like the directions state.  Some bags do seem fuller than others, however.  I have to agree these do stink when taken out of the microwave.  I turn my stove fan on before taking them out of the microwave and pour them out of the bag under the fan and hold the bag and bowl up to the fan for a few seconds.<br />I've tried dipping these into ranch dressing which is a bit of a treat too, but seems to make the porky too soggy, but I like the taste of it.

review/summary: Unbearably salty
review/text: For starters, I'm not salt or msg averse. I enjoy salty food like chips, jerky, and bacon. However, these pork rinds are ridiculously salty tasting. To give you a better idea of what I'm referring to, Kettle Chips Sea Salt variety have 55 mg of salt per 1/2 oz of chips. Lowrey's pork rinds have 310 mg of sodium per 1/2 oz serving. That's roughly six times the salt content of a food considered relatively salty by most people. I read a review on here saying that they were too salty and decided to order them anyway thinking the reviewer was some salt hating baby. Boy, was I mistaken. I wish I hadn't ordered these.

review/text: I saw these on the Food Network Channel, and they made it sound so delicious on TV. I only wanted to buy one or two packets to try, but Amazon only sells them in a big box.  They're light and crispy if they're popped correctly, a little on the salty side because of the MSG seasoning (beware migraine sufferers). Not all of the bacon chips pop, and you can't eat the ones that don't because it's like plastic before they're nuked in the micro.  Now, I am stuck with the rest of the box.

review/text: THESE ARE VERY TASTY FOR A QUICK SNACK, BUT THEY ARE A LITTLE TRICKY TO MICROWAVE. EACH MICROWAVE OVEN COOKS DIFFERENTLY (SIZE AND POWER WATTAGE) IT TAKES A FEW PACKS TO COOK JUST RIGHT. VERY EASY TO OVERCOOK OR UNDER COOK AND THIS EFFECTS THE TASTE GREATLY. AFTER YOU LEARN THE EXACT SECONDS FOR YOUR MICROWAVE THE BETTER THE TASTE. IF YOU OVERCOOK THEM THEY HAVE A CHEMICAL LIKE TASTE...YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW THEM AWAY! (IF NOT COOKED JUST RIGHT)... I LIKE TO WATCH THE BAG COOK FOR BETTER RESULTS. I TAKE THE BAG OUT AT THE POINT OF INFLATION, NO LATER OR THEY WILL BE OVER COOKED. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE NUKING POPCORN, BUT IT IS MORE DIFFICULT.<br /><br />+++UPDATE 1-04-10....WE GO THROUGH ABOUT 2-3 BOXES PER MONTH BECAUSE WE ARE ON A LOW CARB DIET.

review/summary: outstanding flavor, no MSG added, slightly lower sodium
review/text: I have enjoyed nong shim's flavorful ramyun offerings for 10 years now.  I only recently saw their Black label product and hesitantly indulged as it was $2 a pack.  worth it for me.  I think i like it a little better than their classic "gourmet spicy" and am now subscribing for a case every 6 months.  It has beef and beef bone flavorings, perhaps an acquired taste, but they are well executed for an instant product.  It's less piquant than the "gourmet spicy" classic flavor, but very rich in taste thanks to the beef bone extract and other seasonings.  If you like nong shim's gourmet spicy, you'll probably like this.  I like pork bone ramen (Tonkotsu) and really like this as it has the same milky richness in the broth.  I am excited that it's relatively lower sodium (920mg per serving=half pack) than most similar products and apparently has no added MSG... with so much flavor they apparently don't MSG or so much salt.<br /><br />*edit- to other folks that prefer gourmet spicy... i agree that is a classic but enjoyed these more: very good broth especially, less heat but more rich flavor than gourmet spicy.  the lack of sumptuous hunks of freeze dried beef doesn't bother me, I'll garnish mine with whatever I have in the fridge.  I'm disappointed amazon has raised the price somewhat, a case was about $10 cheaper in december.  If you're hesitant, try a single pack at your local korean grocer before you get a case.

review/summary: A tasty noodle but no bargain.
review/text: I have been a long time fan of the Nong Shim brand of noodles.  I started eating them back when I could only get them in all Korean packaging at different local imported grocers.  Being able to buy them with more frequency online is a very nice thing.  I had waited for this specific noodle to be released here and ordered it as soon as it was available on Amazon.  While the hype was high and I do love most Nong Shim products this is good but not great.  I do like the additional packet of seasoning and the different vegetables in this bag.  It might be good if you find the subtle differences worth the premium but I would rather have about twice the regular Shin Noodle at less price.  I do like the differences but I do not believe the premium is justified on this particular flavor.

review/text: I just tried this for the first time, bought a single pack at the local Asian store.<br /><br />It's tasty, it has two soup bases and a pack with some dried bits of beef, onion and mushroom.  It's a sort of hot and spicy beef flavor.<br /><br />The original spicy picante is better and more reasonably priced.  This is not worth the extra cost.<br /><br />My two top faves are Shin Ramyun Gourmet Spicy Picante and Sapporo Chow Mein.  Throw some fresh or frozen spinach in and you've got yourself a nice quick, semi-healthy meal.  The Sapporo Chow Mein doesn't have near the sodium the Ramyun does.

review/summary: Rich Ramyun
review/text: This is my favorite ramyun! Having lived in Korea, I've tried lots. For most kinds, SPICY is the dominant flavor, but this one has a dominant BEEF flavor plus spice and garlic. It's rich. I love it.<br /><br />I like to keep control of my sodium, so I don't use the entire pack, and I barely notice a difference in taste since this is so rich. I put the leftover spices in a mini container and after a few times there's enough to flavor something else (like a cheap bag of noodles or some veggies).<br /><br />Personally, I think this ramyun is well worth the price. For flavor as well as being MSG-free. With the subscription, I pay $1.63 per pack. I can't get great ramyun locally at that price. And I'm happy to have the huge case delivered to my door.

review/summary: Taste is Great but...
review/text: I'm a noodle lover. Can't live without noodles at least once a day. I have more than a dozen different types of noodles stocked in my pantry & I love trying new ones too. I've a subscription to 30 packets of Nong Shim's Gourmet Spicy noodles & was expecting this to be much better. Really, the taste is great. Same type of noodles, texture, etc..same spicy flavor packet but there is another packet of soup seasoning included. There's no dried vegetables packet like the Gourmet Spicy flavor has. No dried vegetables flakes & no beef chunks like the description stated, thus false marketing. The price is too much for this. If this is the new & improved Gourmet Spicy noodles, I'd give it 4 stars. I took off 2 stars because of the unworthy price tag & another star because of the false marketing. I read a comment reply in another review here - A Korean reviewer... I agree entirely. Big hype & price tag but disappoints. I'll stick to the Gourmet Spicy if I were you. Worth the try but not 24 packets!<br /><br />Edit: Not false marketing since it seems like only the very first packet had no dried beef & vegetable so I changed the rating to a 3 star. However, the beef "chunks" are just flakes. Not enough flakes to notice. There are also dried mushrooms. Now, the mushroom pieces are bigger than the ones in the Spicy Gourmet vegetable sachet. Still, not impressed. 1/29/2012

review/text: These were expensive and not any better (except for the quality of the noodles) than the average dollar store brand of Raman Noodles.

Other reviewers have said the same so it wasn't just a bad batch I received. They just don't put any discernable meat in this product.<br />Sorry Nong Shim but I needed to give an honest review.

review/summary: Don't like taste, but do like medicinal qualities
review/text: Out of curiosity, I chose to purchase this particular flavor of Two Leaves and a Bud at my local grocer.  I do not like the taste of the tea without sweetner -- it is very bitter even when using a lower temp for the water (because its green tea) and this is the first time I've ever tasted a green tea that I didn't care for -- The Two Leaves and a Bud Jasmine Green is divine!  With sweetener, the Orange Sencha Green is tolerable (for me).  What I like about this green tea is its medicinal effects.  On the back of all Two Leaves & A Bud packages are brief statements listing what types of foods the teas pair with and/or what the tea is "best for."  The Orange Sencha Green Tea states that it is best for concentration ... and it is.  If I'm feeling particulary foggy headed or out of sorts (lol), I drink a mug of Orange Sencha Green and it clears my head right up!  I appreciate teas that have effective medicinal qualities that are evident within a few sips and this makes up for the unpleasant (my opinion) taste.  I will continue to purchase it and would recommend it as a good reading or studying tea.

Once I experienced it, I drove back the very next morning and bought the remaining inventory they had to enjoy and share with friends. Several months later after running out, I went to the company's website in Aspen Colorado and ordered some more.<br /><br />When I ran out again, they were kind enough to inform me that I could order it from Amazon and that it would qualify for Amazon's awesome free shipping. What an amazing deal. Thanks to everyone at Two Leaves and a Bud and Amazon for their insight to carry such a great product.<br /><br />Bt the way... This is "Whole Leaf Green Tea" and the tea bags are adorable sachets versus the paper type you get with everyone else. Top drawer stuff. You actually savor every last drop.

review/text: I debated a little about whether or not to order just because the reviews are so split down the middle. But I'm a big fan of other Two Leaves and a Bud varieties so I decided I had to give it a fair try. I'm glad I did! I prepared it with warm water, just the same as I do with all green tea, and it turned out really nicely. It's got a light smooth flavor & just a hint of orange. With just a little bit of stevia, it was perfect. I am not a sencha aficionado, so I cannot make a thorough comparison to other sencha teas. But I have been drinking a variety of green teas for a long time and can definitely say it stacks up to the other nice greens that I've had. It's also really refreshing iced so I recommend giving it a try that way this summer as well!

I add a teensy bit (1/4 teaspoon) of Organic Agave for sweetening, and I'm good to go. The bags are elegant, and I love the orange aroma of this tea. I also enjoy Two Buds Earl Grey and their Assam (with almond milk, yum). I wish that other reviewer who disliked this flavor would send me his/her box of 100! I'll drink it. Maybe if you're a purist Green Tea person, this one is too flavored; but like I said, my uneducated palate loves it.

review/summary: Hideous over-powering orange flavor
review/text: Well, where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have been drinking tea (green, black, oolong, white, etc.) for more than 15 years as either loose leaf (whole leaf) or bagged. My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and "deep"). I have also tried many of the products offered by "Two Leaves and a Bud" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).<br /><br />This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).<br /><br />The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).<br /><br />Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & "bitty" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.<br /><br />I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.<br /><br />Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.<br /><br />My advice: buy a single box of this first. If you like it, switch to coffee.

review/text: I have been enjoying a lot of loose leaf tea lately and wanted to sample some gunpowder green tea. Ayer reading the reviews I went for the Tea Attic organic gunpowder green. The price is comparable to other brands online and locally. I had good communication from the seller, and was given two sample teas to try as well (both were fantastic)<br /><br />The tea was packaged in a brown bag. It smelled great, was tightly rolled, and had a fairly shiny surface. I immediately re packed it into a metal tin and it has stayed fresh. When steeped, the pellets expand perfectly revealing the full leaves. It is wonderful to watch.<br /><br />My only complaint, which I know is subjective, is that the taste is much more bitter than I expected. I know how to brew tea and other green teas brewed the same way are not as aggressive. In general, I am not shy about earthy teas, but this was too bitter to drink strait. I added some honey, but could not tone it down enough. I resorted to mixing it In small quantities with other teas to add body and use it up.<br /><br />I gave this tea three stars because the seller was great, and maybe my taste buds are more sensitive than yours. I would buy another tea from them again, but not this same kind.

review/summary: One of my favorite teas!
review/text: Mighty leaf's teas a superb, and this roobis is no exception. The exquisit craftsmanship is clear in their bag composition. This tea is slightly nutty and warming to the depths. I highly recommend this tea. Sometimes you can find it at healthier food stores (like whole foods) or in privately owned tea/coffee shops.
