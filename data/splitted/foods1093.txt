review/summary: disappointing noodles
review/text: My family usually buys rice noodles that are made in Taiwan. We substituted the Taiwanese noodles for the Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli rice noodles (that are from Singapore) in a dish my mother makes. The noodles basically broke into a million tiny pieces and turned to mush. They didn't absorb the flavors of the other ingredients in the dish, although if you ate it all together it tasted okay. The mushy texture wasn't very pleasent though. Perhaps it holds up better in soup-based dishes but it defientely didn't hold up in strictly pasta-based dishes.<br /><br />For those who need a gluten-free diet, this may work out for them. But as for my family and I, it is a product we will not buy if given the chance.

review/summary: brown rice vermicelli
review/text: This was a very easy product to make. You soak it in water for a minute and then use however you like. There are two recipes on the back. I fried mine with some oil and then added red peppers and chicken with some sweet orange sauce. It was very tasty and the consistency of the noodles was good. The noodles didn't have much flavor themselves but took on the sauce flavor well.<br /><br />I liked the very simple ingredients of brown rice, starch and water.<br /><br />The only downside is that extreme thinness of these noodles. They break very easily and also the small size can get stuck between your teeth, we found. Otherwise I liked these noodles a lot, super easy to prepare and tasty.

review/text: For those on a gluten free diet, this is a good buy. It tastes like other rice pastas, but is quicker/easier to cook.<br /><br />My teenage son cooked it with no problems, one 7 ounce package serves four easily (the kid eats a lot and there are enough left overs for 3 adult portions).<br /><br />If you can't eat wheat products, or enjoy rice pasta, you'll enjoy this.

review/summary: Easy, Fast, And Delicious
review/text: To be honest, most gluten free pastas that I've purchased have been a huge disappointment.  Every time I hear about a new one, I give it a try and and accept the fact that I am doomed to be disappointed.  Imagine my surprise to get this product and find that it is easy to use and tastes delicious.  I can't claim that it tastes like wheat pasta, because it has been so long since I have eaten any wheat, that I no longer know what it tastes like.  What I can say is that this is very good, easy to prepare, and that I have finally found a gluten free pasta that I actually like.  It is not the least bit like cardboard, but is a soft tender noodle with a remarkably good flavor and texture.  It isn't too soft and it isn't too hard, it is just perfect.  Almost better than the taste, is the ease of preparation.  Soak the noodles in warm water for a minute, and you are good to go.  The first night I used it, I was in a tearing hurry as usual and I used it for a quick spaghetti meal.  Good as it is, the vermicelli was not the best choice for spaghetti!  It held up well to the heavy sauce, and to reheating in the microwave the next day, but it was a little too thin for that particular use.  On my next attempt, I put some in miso broth, and it was delicious.  Finally, an alternative to ramen noodles!  Not only was it perfect for a light soup with the addition of a few shiitake mushrooms, but it was wonderful in an Asian salad that I made. Amazon also carries the spaghetti, which I am planning to order, and I hope that there are more varieties in the future.  For me, this was perfect, and I have no complaints.  I would definitely use this again.

review/summary: great for a gluten free eating program
review/text: I was excited to try this since I adhere to a gluten free eating plan.  I am used to GF products costing more, and with the subscribe & save option these packages cost just under $2/package--not bad in my experience.<br /><br />Pasta made from rice flour IS bland which is fine, since it takes on whatever you cook with it.  The texture is good, and I think using it in a stir fry would be fabulous--I will try that next time.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product and will be purchasing it myself.  For spaghetti, my husband still prefers Ancient Harvest Quinoa Pasta over all others.

review/summary: Fair Addition To Most Meals
review/text: First of all, no cooking directions are printed on this package, or included, and since I have never made a vermicelli that was spaghetti-looking before, I had to guess.<br /><br />Soaking the vermicelli in water for 30-minutes prior to adding to olive oil in a skillet, I then added some veggies, with a bit of diced chicken breast. A little splash of balsamic vinegar... and it wasn't bad.<br /><br />But I couldn't help but have thought... there should have been something more I could have done for this! I'll need to search my recipes for something spectacular to make with this! Because I know there is something just waiting to be borne from this vermicelli product!<br /><br />***DISCLOSURE: This product was provided by Amazon Vine in exchange for an indepedent and non-biased review.

review/summary: Easy to Stir Fry & Tastes Great
review/text: Easy to cook, takes only a minute to soak it with warm or cold water. Drain well so noodles won't be soggy. A good alternate to spaghetti or thicker Asian noodles. If doing it as soup, just add rice vermicelli after soup is done, no need to cook too long in soup.<br /><br />Works well with meat like chicken & leafy vegetables. Add soy sauce for flavor. Can make it spicy too be adding chili sauce on the side. Add grinded peanuts to make it taste like Thai food. Yum!<br /><br />Cooking time has to be fast, adding the drained rice vermicelli after the meat is cooked and stir fry quickly to avoid getting it too soft. Texture is finer than spaghetti. Taste more like rice stick noodles. For a quick meal it is a good noodle to use. Stir fry for best taste and it is the easiest way to make.<br /><br />I would recommend this to noodles lovers. Can add any variety of seafood, meat and vegetables. Need generous saucing to bring the flavor out. But it was perfect for my home and so very easy to make. 5 stars for the ease of cooking, taste, and quality of the product.

review/summary: Truly Gluten-Free. Odd Texture.
review/text: This is an interesting twist on the usual white rice vermicelli.  I've eaten one serving of these and I can tell you that they are truly gluten-free.  However, they have an almost grainy texture that does not lend itself to soups.  These would probably work better in stir fry.

review/text: I give this five stars because it tastes no different from the ordinary delicious white rice vermicelli -- it's called beehoon in Asia. I made one of my favorite dishes with this product: BeeHoon Goreng, which is (un)like the Americanized Lo Mein, only with rice noodle. However, I cannot agree with the direction on the package. WHAT KIND OF CHEF IN SINGAPORE WAS CONSULTED FOR THIS PRODUCT? Pre-soaking? Olive oil? Cheese? That consultant: I want to beat that person up with my wooden spoon! Perhaps, the company has consulted someone who never cooks and eats this type of noodle in the first place! That direction is the kind that makes people think healthier foods usually taste worse, the kind that makes people go back to junk food, the kind that makes people eat mediocre foods in excess! Hmmmphh.....!!!

review/summary: Would recommend them if you like Simply Asia
review/text: I love eating Simply Asia noodles, but there's only one problem. Although the packages say that the ingredients are "chicken flavor," I'd rather do without it altogether and just have vegetables (as a vegetarian). But I'm paying for both and wasn't quite sure which noodles to use if I wanted to make these types of vegetable bowls myself. I tested these noodles, and it turns out they're just fine. I enjoy them and would recommend these if you don't want to buy the individually wrapped <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064KAAA">Mccormick and Company Inc. Rce Ndle Bowl, Spring Veg, 2.50-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> bowls (or any others but that's the best one). These noodles are easy to make.<br /><br />Watch out, too, because they're done so fast that they can very easily be overcooked. The only other downside is they're a mess to break up. You open the bag and they crunch immediately and spill everywhere. It's almost easier to use a pot that's too big to make sure you don't have to sweep every time you eat the things. I've swept twice after making a serving.

review/summary: Hard, dry, too chewy
review/text: I was pretty excited about these noodles: I'm a fan of brown rice and a fan of vermicelli, so I figured the combination would be pretty good. How wrong I was. Don't get me wrong, it was edible, but the noodles simply wouldn't soften enough no matter how long I kept them soaking in water. I made the recipe on the package, which calls for browning some garlic and pepper in oil and then mixing the noodles in for a minute or two. I won't lie - I was pretty disappointed with how it turned out. The consistency is tough and I wouldn't use these in a stir fry again. Perhaps they'd be better in soup, but probably not much better. If you're on a gluten-free diet I guess these are okay, but otherwise I'd stick with regular vermicelli.

review/summary: Tasted okay, but no real clear directions on how to cook
review/text: I had the Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli with my family today for lunch, and while I liked how it tasted, I was a little concerned with the fact that there were no real directions on how to cook it.  The directions were basically "soak for a minute to soften up the noodles", then a couple of methods for preparing it.  I'm used to cooking other kinds of boxed vermicelli with very precise directions, so this kind of threw me off.  Otherwise, it was okay.

review/summary: Super thin yet excellent structure even in soup
review/text: I'm not usually a big fan of rice noodles but I love brown rice so I thought these would be less starchy then the usual white rice noodles. I was right, they are much less starchy. I was surprised how well these noodles held up even after soaking about 6 minutes and then dropping them in a little boiling water for about 20 seconds. I used them in Vietnamese Pho soup and they were really wonderful. We were both surprised that as thin as they are they held together and were even a little firm and very easy to eat out of the big soup bowls with chop sticks. On their own they are not super flavorful like all rice noodles but they do taste like brown rice it's just subtle. They were a very pleasant surprise especially since we usually go for thick chewy udon noodles yet, I still felt very satisfied with these nice thin brown rice noodles. They are also great tossed with a simple seafood saute with some green onions, mushrooms and sesame oil and a touch of soy. I don't care for fried anything so we soak them in cold water while a little water is on the stove boiling and when it's hot we just drop them in for about 20 seconds and they are firm and tender ready to toss with fresh ingredients. I will definitely buy these again!

review/summary: Good pasta for fans of gluten-free foods
review/text: My husband and I used this product last night and we both came up with similar reactions.<br /><br />This is a pasta-like product processed from brown rice. It is fat, gluten, and cholesterol-free. One serving provides about 200 calories and 0.6 g of fiber.<br /><br />Pros: Flavor is good. Tastes much like angel hair pasta. Would be good for those who have a gluten allergy or prefer to avoid gluten. Easy and quick to prepare.<br /><br />Cons: Cooking instructions don't include basic cooking instructions or other ways it could be used. There are two recipes, which are vague about how long to cook product. The instructions say to soak the product for a minute in room temperature water. This only softens them up. I decided to heat some chicken broth in a pan, add the softened vermicelli and cook it for a few minutes until is absorbed the broth and became edible.<br /><br />We served it under a chicken and sauce dish and it performed exactly like angel hair pasta.<br /><br />Another problem is the packaging. The product comes in very thin strands which are curled around so that when you try to remove only a portion of it, you get a mess of crumbled up strands all over the place. Before softening, the product resembles dry hay!<br /><br />Not a bad product, but since we have no need for cooking gluten-free, we'll stick with regular angel hair pasta.

review/summary: Good food
review/text: We eat a lot of pasta at our house, and we also experiment with other foods from time to time.  This week we tried out the brown rice vermicelli.  We had it with a Thai peanut sauce, mushrooms, peppers, and this and that.<br /><br />This vermicelli is extremely fine...and since we had never used it before we did what anyone should do...follow the directions.  That is, we let it sit in lukewarm water for a minute to help it start to soften up, but that was not enough to prepare it for eating...at least in our view.  So what we did next was put some water on in the kettle, took it to a boil, poured it into a bowl, and then plopped the noodles in as well.  They were thoroughly cooked and ready to go within just a couple of minutes of soaking in it's own little hot tub.  On went the sauce and we were rolling!<br /><br />This vermicelli has a good texture and flavor, and it went well with the peanut sauce we used.  I imagine that these noodles would also work well with food prepared in a wok, or any other number of preparations.<br /><br />All in all I'd say that it was a hit with our crew.<br /><br />4 stars<br /><br />P.S. On an aside...I feel compelled to comment on the packaging for this product.  This item came as a single 7-oz bag of noodles, but it was shipped in a box that was 17"x14"x8", and there was a bunch of air pillow packing material in there to keep it from shifting, but not enough to really keep it from shifting!?  In short, the box was just WAY too big = wasteful packaging.

review/summary: Delicate, light, easy to work with, quick to "cook"
review/text: The package directions say to soak the vermicelli in room temperature water for a minute before using. My water was cold, not room temp, so it wasn't plumping very much, it remained stiff. So I threw it into the pan (I was making stir fry) with plenty of cooking liquid, put the lid on and it cooked just fine. But it's delicate stuff, so if you overwork it or move it around too much once in the pan, it will result in small pieces of "pasta" dispersed throughout the dish.  If you want long strands, plump it ahead of time and add it to the dish at the last minute, just to heat through.<br /><br />Just like regular pasta, it does not have much flavor on its own, so be sure to consider this when formulating your recipes.  Reminds me a little of spaghetti squash in texture, but it won't hold up to a heavy pasta sauce, so it's more appropriate for stir frys or a light pesto.

This pre-cooking stage is very important, but luckily takes only a few minutes, which you can use to prepare the other ingredients for the mix.<br /><br />I had this as a simple stir-fry with steamed broccoli, onion, carrot -- whatever vegetables were handy.  I then added just a spoonful of (homemade) pickled ginger and a few drops of squeezed lime juice.  Heavenly!<br /><br />These were so tasty that I would never have guessed they were made of brown rice, if I had not had the package close by.<br /><br />Easily makes enough for two meals.

review/summary: Delicious but a Challenge to Portion for Storage
review/text: I have never sought out gluten-free products because I didn't have a reason to. Therefore when I received this item I was looking forward to a new taste experience. Made in Singapore these noodles are made out of brown rice. I prepared them exactly as I would pasta. When done, the vermicelli does not have a lot of flavor, but when you add salt, cheese and tomato sauce, it makes a tasty side dish. It was easy to prepare and they tasted as much as you would expect noodles to taste.<br /><br />The package contains two recipes: Brown Rice Vermicelli in Aglio Olio style and Brown rice vermicelli with vegetable strips. Be aware that though the item says it is fat free, the package contains three servings with 209 calories for each serving. Therefore, the only real downside to these noodles is that you can't properly use a small portion to save the rest for later. When you open the package all the noodles are entangled in one bunch. You can try seperating them but the strands are thin and easily breakable so it's a challenge doing this without making a mess. Plus, once you break open the package, you can't re-package it. You'll have to use another container to store them.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if you want great noodles, you will not be disappointed with Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli.

review/summary: Successfully experimenting with a product new to me.
review/text: This was my first (and second) time to use rice noodles.  Therefore, everything about them was brand new to me.  In consistency they come closer to being angle hair pasta, only even more delicate.  They are fat free, gluten free, cholesterol free, and have approximately 209 calories per two ounce serving.  Straight out of the package the vermicelli very closely resembles fine straw.  If you've never cooked with them before, profit from my experience and be careful in how you handle them.  They are so "crisp" that I managed to get them all over my stovetop when I was breaking them into smaller pieces to add to a pot of soup.  Afterwards I had to take my gas stove apart to clean out all the tiny bits which had gotten down in the burners.  My fault, not the products, so I learned from that first experience.<br /><br />I made a pot of very delicately flavored chicken soup and added half the package of brown rice vermicelli.  Since I was adding the noodles to hot liquid I did not soak the noodles before using them.  That seemed like it would have been serious overkill.  The noodles did not appear to have any flavor of their own to me or to my husband, but they worked very well in this soup.  It was so light that I was afraid we would be hungry again in a few hours but that was not the case.  Obviously these noodles have some serious nutritional value.  My next experiment was with a beef stir fry.  Once again, I went very light on the flavorings and the ingredients and this time I did soak the noodles in a bowl of hot water for one minute before adding them to the pan.  I tasted one noodle before adding them to the pan and, once again, could not discern any flavor in the noodle itself.  The beef stir fry was very good and, as in the previous recipe, very filling and appetite satisfying.<br /><br />These noodles would probably not stand up very well to heavy, rich sauces but I don't know that for sure.  I'm very glad I was able to experiment with this pack and we were able to get more than the 3.5 servings the package states because of the leftovers.  My family is accustomed to eating heavier, more dense pasta so this was a true departure for us.  It is an enjoyable alternative and I'm sure I will be coming up with more recipes in the future to use this product for my family.

review/summary: Cook up well; versatile
review/text: Due to a severe wheat allergy, I only eat rice pasta, and have tried many varieties and brands. Vermicelli style is my favorite since it's so versatile and can be used in many recipes as a substitute for wheat noodles. It works as a stand-in for ramen noodles, in chicken noodle soup, as spaghetti, and a side dish. These heat up when used as noodles quite quickly--within about two minutes in boiling water, although they can stay in longer for softer noodles. Some rice pasta sheds severely when cooked in this method, leaving the cooking broth cloudy and opaque-looking. I haven't had that problem with this brand.<br /><br />Aside from cooking them in boiling water for use as noodles, I also have tried them with a traditional vermicelli recipe. When used for vermicelli, the instructions state to soak them in water first.<br /><br />As for flavor, these are really mild and not overpowering, as some gluten-free pastas can be, and absorb flavorings well. They also stick together very nicely for not containing binders like eggs and gluten. This brand ties with my favorite!

review/summary: This vermicelli is good for a quick gluten free meal
review/text: Vermicelli is quick cooking similar to angela hair pasta, only quicker.  To me this brown rice vermicelli tastes no different than other vermicelli - all are flavorless but they pick up the flavor of the meal and provide an interesting chewy texture to a quick stir fry.<br /><br />I decided to make the Brown Rice Vermicelli in Aglio Olio sytle which was one of the two recipes on the instructions.  However, it said to soak the vermicelli for one minute and I found that not to be enough soaking time. Also, the recipe has no measurements for ingredients as the cook gets to decide how much of this or that goes into the dish.  I was a little disappointed that the vermicelli wasn't soft enough for the stir fry after the soaking time specified.  I wound up putting in more olive oil just so the dish wouldn't burn as this recipe didn't call for any water or broth.  I decided to also add vegetables to the dish but it would have been better had I julienne'd the vegetables so that it would have mixed better with the vermicelli.<br /><br />According to the package there are 3.5 servings at 209 calories each serving.  There are only 3 ingredients in this vermicelli (brown rice, sago starch and water).<br /><br />If I needed vermicelli for a dish I were making, I would definitely purchase this if it were available.  However, this is not the type of product that I would go out searching for as I'd be equally happy with any vermicelli (brown rice or otherwise) that were available although I would consider brown rice brand first.  Just don't rely on the recipes on this package because they are not complete.

review/summary: Pleasant-tasting all-natural product
review/text: We had The Peacock brand vermicelli for dinner last night. In most respects it seems to be like most other vermicelli I've eaten, and I mean that in a good way. Easy to prepare (just follow the directions), and the taste was pleasant. If the price was competitive compared to other vermicelli I'd buy this without hesitation, but taste-wise there is nothing about it that makes it stand out from similar products I have eaten. If you're looking for an all-natural vermicelli product I think you'll be pleased with this.<br /><br />The main attraction here is the product's ingredients list: brown rice, sago starch, and water. It's advertised as being "all natural", and I think that qualifies! No chemicals. Compare that to a Korean brand of vermicelli, which also contains things like Xanthan Gum, Sodium Alginate, and Malic Acid. So the Peacock brand is a product you'll want to use if you're worried about eating an engineered food with added chemicals.<br /><br />Compared to the Korean brand, the Peacock brand has a slightly higher fat and sodium content, and a lower iron content. I don't think this is a big deal unless you have to keep a close watch of your fat, sodium, or iron intake.<br /><br />The nutrition information indicates a single package makes 3.5 servings. My wife was of the opinion it actually makes 4 decent-sized servings. You'll want to have something else with it though, as once serving of noodles isn't going to fill you up for long.

review/summary: Gluten free noodles, hooray!
review/text: While there are options for gluten-free noodles these days, I love these because they don't feel like a substitute for the "real thing." The addition of these into an Asian broth soup recently elevated the dish into an entree and was slurped up hungrily by my picky six-year-old son. I felt good about giving him a brown rice product that cooks quickly, tastes good and holds its texture, things not all non-wheat noodle products can effectively do. Though I received this free, I bought more for quick weekday soup recipes. Recommended.

review/summary: Delicious alternative!
review/text: If you want an alternative to high-gluten pasta or even rice or some other side dish, this is a lovely choice!  Soak the dry noodles for a minute, then have your way with them.  I chose to saute some onion, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil and add the Vermicelli.  The result was very tasty, leaving my dinner companion searching the kitchen for seconds.  This is not an all-in-one option. The package contains only the noodles, no season packet or other add-ons.  Seven ounces of dry product is more than enough to serve four as a side dish.<br /><br />I would have given the Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli five stars, but I have a problem with the sideways packaging. The dry noodles, very fine, as expected, are packed sideways in the bag.  To cook the entire bag is easy--just dump it into the soaking water--but if, like me, you want to cook just half or less, removing the noodles from the package to break them in half results in hair-thin bits of pasta sprinkled everywhere.  My kitchen floor is still crunchy.

review/summary: Interesting texture
review/text: Very interesting noodles.  Not much flavor and a strange texture.  I gave this product four stars, though, because it's possible I didn't prepare it correctly.  Also, my husband really liked them and he is the gluten-free person of the household.  I will probably get more and experiment with the preparation.  I did what the package said to do: soak in water for one minute before saut&eacute;ing in pan with vegetables.  However, they seemed rather sticky and dry unless they had extra sauce.  Maybe I'm just used to plump, juicy, gluten noodles and am spoiled.  For those of you who are gluten-free like my hubby this may seem like a delicacy!

review/text: I was skeptical to see this sort of delicate rice noodle made of brown rice. However, I was able to make it using almost identical methods as the traditional white-rice variety, and it worked well. Flavor is of course a bit stronger due to the brown-rice content, but it's good. (I made Singapore Noodles using the rather mediocre recipe at Epicurious.)

review/text: I couldn't wait to try these noodles. My physician recommended that I adopt a wheat free, gluten free diet to reduce inflammation. It seemed to me that everything I ate contained wheat, and I was concerned about finding delicious, wheat free, gluten free foods.  These brown rice noodles are just what I was looking for.  These noodles are as easy to cook as ramen noodles, but so much more tasty.  I used it in chicken broth with mushrooms, bean sprouts, and tofu.  Delicious.  You will like these.

review/summary: Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli
review/text: I'm all for trying out alternative noodle products that aren't made out of wheat.  So this brown rice vermicelli seemed to be right up my alley.  It boasted all natural ingredients, gluten free, fat free, and cholesterol free attributes, so it was a healthy option too.  And the fact that there is only three ingredients in the product is a huge plus too.  The package says it only contains Brown Rice, Sago Starch, and water.  Pretty simple, and I like that.<br /><br />The package it came in was pretty attractive, I do have to say.  A nicely designed bag with some marvelous looking food on the front and it clearly stated what was in the package.  There was a clear window in the back where you could see the actual product as well, so you're not buying blindly.  And they even included two simple recipes on the back along with the nutritional information.  What surprised me most was just how thin this vermicelli was.  Very tiny noodles and they were looped together like a giant thing of thread.  And thread size is actually a good comparison for it.  It was colored a very pale brown, which accounts for being made out of brown rice.<br /><br />Cooking was easy enough.  I tossed it into a pot of boiled water and within minutes it was done.  But due to the very thin nature of the noodle I would advise watching it carefully or you could end up with a goopy mess if it overcooks.  The taste was good, a bit plain but it carried the sauce I made (a cheese base) well and let the sauce shine through instead of the noodle.  It was very soft to bite into, but as said before about the over cooking, that was probably a result of my skills and not the actual product.<br /><br />I would probably get these noodles again.  I like that they have few ingredients and are healthy, and I can have some gluten intolerant people over for dinner.  Not a bad deal all around.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Pretty good rice noodles
review/text: Previously, I've attempted a recipe with white rice noodles and overcooked them, which made them soggy. So I was determined not to overcook these brown rice noodles. I tried making two dishes. The first was a miso soup with brown rice noodles, which was really just broth with miso and green onions and the noodles added when it was hot. The noodles softened and puffed up, but I think I should of softened them in water and maybe rinsed them first. The broth ended up being a little starchy from the noodles, but it was pretty good.<br /><br />The noodles by themselves don't really have any flavor, they just take on the flavor of whatever dish they are in. So the rice noodles in miso probably wasn't the best idea because the mild miso flavor didn't really give the noodles much flavor. I also tried stir frying the noodles which was much better. I just soaked the noodles in hot water, for about a minute, and then drained them. They came out clear and kind of crunchy. Then I stir fried them with garlic, onion, salt, and coconut oil. I also added some vinegar and nama shoyu for flavor. These noodles came out crunchy and spicy and actually were pretty good.<br /><br />The nice thing about these noodles is they only need about a minute in warm water and then they can be fried or added to soups or other dishes, so they are fairly versatile. They are also gluten free and the brown rice noodles seem more firm than the white rice noodles. As another reviewer posted it does look like these noodles are made in Singapore.

review/summary: Will take some getting used to for most
review/text: The package for these noodles includes one set of general instructions and two recipes -- I'd ignore the general instructions which state that you can soften the noodles in 1 minute at room temperature water, I went straight to hot water for several minutes as the noodles are basically like straw like when you pull them from the package and it just seemed silly to think that one minute at room temperature could do much for them (even 1 minute in hot water wasn't enough so it turned out I was right).<br /><br />If, like me, you have little to no experience with noodles of this kind I'd definitely do a search on how to prepare these.  As I stated earlier, the package does come with two recipes but they are very vague and for someone new to the noodles / insecure in their cooking skills (aka me) they're not very useful.<br /><br />If you're not used to brown rice pasta and are/or not used to healthy tasting foods this will probably take some getting used to, it definitely has that "this is good for you" taste that will make it a tough sell for some (just add the right sauce or some cheese and those types will get over that real quick).<br /><br />Still despite their issues if you like healthy foods (I do) and don't mind having to experiment with something new (or already know how to use such a pasta) you'll probably love these.

review/summary: Taste better than you would expect
review/text: So, I tend to eat gluten free so I like trying new products. Some gluten free products are amazing, and most are not. These don't seem like much by themselves, but they are pretty good with a nice sauce. It definitely isn't anything on its own. It has zero flavor, but it has a pretty nice texture with a stir fry or in a soup if you don't want anything too heavy.<br /><br />I did an experiment and tried a stir fry with peanut sauce and tried it with brown rice and also these brown rice noodles. I thought for sure the rice would taste better. The rice had a more grounding dense texture, but when I tried the noodles I was pleasantly surprised. They were fluffy and airy and didn't overpower the food, they just complemented it. So if you want something less filling than rice, or more healthy than white rice noodles you will like these.<br /><br />Just a note, these are very thin like angel hair pasta, not vermicelli. Also, the directions say to put in lukewarm water for one minute. That wasn't nearly enough. They needed to be in hot water for about 6 minutes. At least that was my experience.

review/summary: Packaging Needs Better Instructions
review/text: This brown rice vermicelli is okay.  The taste and texture is very similar to the Thai Kitchen Original Pad Thai noodles I've used before, but these do seem somewhat healthier.  I much prefer whole wheat angel hair pasta for texture, but if you're looking for Asian rice noodles, these aren't bad.<br /><br />Where this product really suffers is the package instructions.  Reading the instructions left me with more questions than answers.  It recommends soaking the noodles in water to soften, but it doesn't tell you how much, and it doesn't tell you to drain the water off before cooking.  Luckily, I've made this kind of noodle before and could figure it out.  It then tells you to add the vermicelli to heated olive oil in a skillet and remove from heat, but it doesn't tell you how long to cook it!  I guess it's just until heated, but some sort of idea would be nice.<br /><br />I made a recipe I've used before using Pad Thai noodles, and it turned out about the same as it usually does.  I think, though, if I hadn't used a product like this with adequate directions before, then I would have been totally lost.

review/summary: Very nice whole-grain noodles
review/text: This package of noodles is very similar to some we buy at a local Chinese grocery (300g for two dollars), which are also made in Singapore.  Eating whole grain rice is better for health than refined grains for a variety of reasons, and we are looking to replace refined grains with whole grains where we can.  This product should especially be of interest to those who cannot eat gluten, because being rice, they are gluten-free.<br /><br />The package has two recipes on the back.  One of them is an Asian soup, similar to our family favorite, so I decided to use them in today's soup for lunch.  The recipe talked about blanching the noodles, then cooking them into the soup until tender.  I put them in just-boiled (but not boiling) water for about 15 seconds, then drained them.  At that point they were cooked enough to enjoy, and they expanded a little in volume, so I put them into the bowls by themselves.  Of course, they cooled while we finished making the soup, but pouring the hot soup over the noodles brought them back to temperature quickly.<br /><br />The second recipe is sort of a seafood scampi with noodles.  I have a pretty good idea that the noodles will be nice in that dish, but I will update this review after we have made it in a day or two.<br /><br />The package has 7 ounces of product.  Looking at the nutritional statement, the serving size is 2 ounces, so the package says it contains 3.5 servings.  While it would have been more convenient to have an even number of servings, I found that using 3 ounces of uncooked noodles was plenty for two servings of soup.  Why 7 ounces?  This product is made in Singapore, and the package contains 200 grams, which happens to be about 7 ounces.  The Singaporean package design did not consider the US standards for serving sizes.<br /><br />Rice noodles (of any kind) do not have a lot of distinctive flavor; their flavor is very mild.  Therefore it is not easy to declare this as "delicious", but they are nice, and we enjoyed them.  Rice noodles do a fine job of taking on the flavors you put with them - in our case, Myanmar Mohinga soup.  The texture, especially with my brief cooking, was very pleasant.<br /><br />Some noodles we buy at the local Chinese market (which are NOT whole grain) are arranged in serving-size bundles in the package, making it very convenient to take out the desired number of servings.  These come as one hunk of noodles.  One suggestion I would make for improving this product is to make them into serving-size bunches, because pulling out odd lots causes them to snap and fly all over, and so I do not have to use a diet scale to measure serving sizes.

review/summary: Vermicelli, Celiac Disease and recipes, oh my!
review/text: Preparation: This was super simple with this product. With Traditional Mai Fun you need to soak it for 10 minutes in very hot water. This product just needs to be soaked in water at room temperature for a few minutes to soften and be ready to eat. The texture is very  chewy and I did add extra cooking liquid to allow it to steam. After soaking and steaming the vermicelli still did a decent job holding it's shape.<br /><br />Texture : My kids did not really like the texture of the vermicelli and prefer the Tinkyada pasta and noodles. I actually think the texture mimics Mai Fun very well and if you enjoy a Mai Fun stir fry this would be excellent. The rice/sago texture really does not make it a good substiture for pasta.<br /><br />Flavor: Nice clean rice based flavor. It picked up the flavor of the cooking liquid very nicely.<br /><br />Recipes on the package : The instructions on these are pretty vague. There is no ingredient list or amounts in the recipes. The instructions tell you, as an example, to "prepare a clear soup stock with anchovies, soybeans, salt and sugar; mix a variety of vegetables strips in oyster and soya sauce with the stock, add blanched brown rice vermicelli, toss and simmer until cooked." If you can soar with a recipe like this, go for it. If not, I'd look online for stir fry recipes using Mai Fun. Note also that the recipe stated that you should use 'blanched' noodles, while the preparation instructions for the noodles state that you soak them in room temperature water! I found that the soaking at room temperature worked fine but you do need more than a minute for the noodles to soften. I think that the recipe is a little 'lost in translation' but the product is still a good one if you can find a better recipe for it.<br /><br />Is it REALLY Gluten Free? : If you're living with Celiac disease your criteria for what makes something 'gluten free' is often a very strict one. I've learned to trust many of the items that are made in the US and labeled Gluten free as long as the allergy information does not say that it is made on equipment shared with wheat products. The packaging on this item does not say anything regarding shared equipment and the same Singapore based brand also produces wheat flour and wheat starch. Except for the Gluten free label up front and the ingredient list (Brown Rice, Sago Starch and water) there is no further explanation of it's gluten free status. My child with celiac is not super reactive to trace amounts of gluten but, if you are, this may be something to consider.<br /><br />I did call the East Coast distributors but was unable to get an answer for the shared equipment question. I will email the manufacturers and update this review if I get an answer. Unless I can determine for sure that the factory uses dedicated gluten free equipment we will, unfortunately, not be using this product again.

review/summary: Quick but more processed and less tasty than other forms of brown rice
review/text: I ordered this because I like whole grains and brown rice, but now that I've tried it out it strikes me more as a fairly highly processed food. On the plus side it's convenient, made from brown rice, super quick to prepare, and versatile enough to be used with either Asian or Italian-style sauces, which supply most of the flavor to what you eat. On the minus side, anything you can cook like this in almost no time has been altered--or processed--significantly from its original whole-grain state and consequently will tend to have a higher glycemic index, fewer nutrients, and less taste. It's like the difference between brown rice and brown Minute Rice or old-fashioned oats and instant oatmeal.<br /><br />These noodles are so bland, air-spun, and taste-free that they hardly seemed like real food to me. I also didn't like that they're not organic and come from Singapore as I'd rather eat American-grown food for environmental, nutritional, and economic reasons. I doubt I'll be ordering them again, though they're probably healthier than most white flour ramen-type products and certainly convenient to use.

review/summary: Great gluten-free product and super-fast cooking!
review/text: I am gluten intolerant, but have not taken to most gluten-free pastas. I have several boxes of rice spaghetti that I just can't manage to eat because it is so underwhelming. The rice pastas I've tried fall apart when cooked; you need to watch them especially carefully, and even if you get them off the heat at the right time, they aren't great leftovers. Like soy milk or turkey bacon, rice pasta is usually entirely disappointing if you are expecting the "real thing".<br /><br />What I love most about the Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli is that it does not fall apart. This is not just a function of not boiling it (though that's excellent); I think it's something about how it's made as well. It has substance.<br /><br />Update:<br />The cooking instructions on the bag are feeble. Here's what I suggest most people do:<br />1. Boil water and add salt, as you normally would with pasta. 4 quarts is probably about the right size, though I use a 6-quart pot as my generic pasta pot, so that's what I used.<br />2. Add the noodles; stir.<br />3. You can even turn the heat off at that point, though you can also wait a minute or two with the heat on. Do not leave them soaking in water for too long; rice pasta tends to dissolve. (I have not tried this with these particular noodles yet.) Two or three minutes is all you need for the cooking time.<br /><br />They are really great noodles.<br /><br />Here's the rest of my original review:<br />I cooked my sample package in the microwave with chicken broth. Cook a minute, stir, repeat. (This could be more streamlined, but I was trying to maintain a high noodle to broth ratio, thus the need to keep the noodle moist in not really enough broth.) I added salt, pepper, and parmesan, but of course there are many options once you have the substrate.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Can cook in liquid in a microwave, almost like ramen (not quite that easily). Or just soften in a bowl of water to be cooked with other things in a frying pan, as per the directions.<br />2. Maintains its structure, even as leftovers<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. I agree with others that it doesn't have much flavor, but I think that's if you compare it to wheat pasta, and if you are gluten intolerant, that's not an option. Update! I think it's because of the salt. When most of us cook pasta, we put salt in the water, and the cooking methods suggested on the package do not add salt.<br /><br />Other:<br />1. These are much finer noodles than what I think of as vermicelli, finer than angel hair. Which is great in that it enables the no-heat softening. So this is just a heads up in case you're expecting noodles that are a bit thicker than a spaghetti.<br /><br />Alternative product:<br />I just tried notta pasta vermicelli, and it's also good, but different. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I5MAB0">Notta Pasta Rice Vermicelli, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> It's not made from brown rice, it's a larger package (despite the weights, it makes about twice as much as this, though the overall price/meal is comparable, I think. The notta pasta has you boil it for 2-3 minutes and that worked well. The notta also comes in boxes, not bags, so it seems to stay in tact in the package better. But the box is surprisingly hard to open.<br /><br />I am going to try Peacock again, and try boiling it. (Which worked, see above.)<br /><br />I am now getting the Peacock via subscribe and save, and very happy with that.

review/text: Believe it or not, this pasta does not need to be boiled in water!  All you do is soak it in regular tap water and then cook it as desired.  We had ours with pesto, so we put the pasta in a saute pan, covered it with water and let it soak for approx 2 minutes.  Then we poured the water down the drain, added our pesto sauce along with about a cup of water (you'll be able to tell how much water you need to add, if any) and heated it in the pan for a couple minutes - that was it.  The vermicelli was almost exactly like regular pasta, only a tiny bit chewier.  I would definitely buy this to keep on hand when we want pasta fast, without having to wait for a pot of water to boil.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the instructions on the package were very vague.  There are two recipes on the back, but they don't give amounts for anything - not even the amount of water to soak the pasta in.  You'll kind of have to keep checking things as you go along.

review/summary: Delicious and good for you....
review/text: I have always been a huge fan of rice vermicelli, in Asian foods. The only setback is that most rice vermicelli is made from processed, refined flour. Hence, the carbohydrates are simple - not complex. This means that the carbohydrate is converted to sugar in your system, and it induces in your system a feeling of "crash and burn." Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli is made from complex carbohydrates. This means your body will process and convert the nutrients, more sustainably.<br /><br />A great recipe for these noodles is very simple and incredibly satisfying. Sautee one onion with 2-3 cloves of garlic, with a tablespoon of grape seed oil. Cook until golden brown, add 1/4 of a head of red cabbage, soy sauce, peanut butter and minced ginger. Add tofu and water softened vermicelli (soak for one minute prior to adding to recipe). Cook until all ingredients are soft. Serve warm with a cup of oolong tea on the side. Delicious.

review/text: When it has come down to each of us, we need to find better in the way we eat and also cook. For Peacock, they definitely have made some very strong grains and rice foods. That comes in well with their Brown Rice Vermicelli. It is simple and easy to cook, but also tastes pretty goos with just about anything you add with it, whether it is chicken, vegetables, or beef. I was surprised at how good it tastes. It flows well with the others brands of rice makers like Uncle Ben's and Success. I would give this a try and give Peacock a piece on your plate, and keep in mind for your foods.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: B<br /><br />Overall: B

review/summary: Like eating crunchy hair
review/text: I'm pretty easy going about noodles. And I like my pasta with no fuss. So I was disappointed with these Brown Rice Vermicelli. Following the packaged instructions, the  noodles came out so al dente they tased like crunchy hair or easter grass. No one in my family liked them. I ended up eating mine on top of my fried rice like a garnish, but frankly they were just too hard. Only after the noodles had sat uneaten in the bowl in a sink filled with soapy dish water, did these noodles actually soften up to a reasonable texture. So my advice?- soak 'em longer than the package says.<br /><br />I also have to say the instructions weren't that good. Its really hard to mess up noodles... But these yes... It is possible.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend this product. I like my pasta fuss-free, and this was a high maintenance low mileage generic tasting stuff. I've had better- and a lot less fuss too.

review/summary: Very Tasteful
review/text: I have loved "Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli, 7-Ounce Packages"(I am assuming at that age they might have been another brand but they were the vermicelli) since childhood.  I loved watching the waiter get a wok full of hot olive oil, adding veggies and various meats(whichever you chose) and throw these noodles into the hot mixture....poof...they were little bird nests with yummy food inside.<br /><br />I did this at home with  "Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli, 7-Ounce Packages" with crab, orange, cilantro, Vidalia onion sliced very thin and threw in the noodles...Poof, I was back to childhood.<br /><br />Delicious after being tossed a bit with a slice of lime.<br /><br />Wonderful choice I made and I will make it again.  They are incredibly healthy so tasty and good for you....how can you miss?

review/summary: Don't like this
review/text: I would never recommend this item. I made it tonight with some vegetables and it pretty much ruined dinner. The taste is very bland (unlike other brown rice pasta that I've had) and the noodles are so small that they seem to divide and conquer the plate and completely take over. These are thinner than regular vermicelli and probably should just be labeled as an Asian brown rice noodle instead of trying to be an Italian vermicelli noodle. If you're seeking a brown rice noodle that tastes good and has substance to it, this isn't it. Try Tinkyada instead.

review/summary: Difficult to Cook
review/text: The instructions on the back of this product were obviously a struggle to write in English and not clear.  The product itself has no flavoring other than what you add.  Rice pastas are notoriously difficult to cook as they will dissolve into a glob if not cooked correctly.  Since I am experienced with cooking them, I figured out despite the incorrect instructions how to prepare this and that the flavoring was up to me to add.  You don't soak it for over a minute in cool water, then drain it, then stir it into a hot, non-stick skillet, with plenty of olive oil or oil of your choice that you've already cooked your peppers, garlic, onion, whatever you want to flavor it with.  Keep some broth handy to add into the vermicelli as you are cooking it which it will absorb  rapidly.  Don't leave it!  This will be a short process when you start cooking it.  Be careful stirring it or it will break up into little sticks.  Actually, a package of Rice A Roni, is a lot easier to cook than this!

review/summary: Meh - better rice noodles & GF options out there
review/text: We're Gluten Free, so we eat rice noodles on a regular basis. Whenever I see a new brand come along I usually give it a try and most of the time they aren't as good as Tinkyada <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H4P5UK">Tinkyada Brown Rice Pasta, Spaghetti, Organic, 12-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, and this product is no different.<br /><br />First off, I never follow the instructions on noodles - I cook them all the same way I was taught by my mother...boil the water, put them all in with a bit of salt (oil optional) and test them until the right texture is achieved. I did the same with these - I'm not up for soaking, or  boiling water, putting in noodles then letting it sit off the burner for "x" amount of time or any of that. So, that may make a difference. Anyways...<br /><br />Many of the noodles were broken, so be aware of that if ordering vs. picking them out yourself in a store. I personally don't like noodles so thin - they are harder to work with and to me just don't contribute much to the overall meal. However, I do like the really thin rice noodles used for Pad Thai, Pho and dishes such as that and they cook super quick as well! My favorite of those are: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CRKNPK">GLUTEN FREE Vietnamese Brown Rice Noodles with Organic Green Tea - JUST NOODLES, 8.6 oz, 4 SERVINGS per box (Pack of 6)</a> These are very long and skinny, cook really quick, and an be used like spaghetti noodles or in any way you might want to use noodles. I suggest you buy those instead.<br /><br />My suggestion is to go with Tinkyada noodles for any type of "regular" noodle dishes you need, and the Just Noodles <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CRKNPK">GLUTEN FREE Vietnamese Brown Rice Noodles with Organic Green Tea - JUST NOODLES, 8.6 oz, 4 SERVINGS per box (Pack of 6)</a> whenever you need super quick cooking noodles or for Asian, Thai, etc. type dishes. I think they're tastier, have a much better texture, they're easy to cook and overall I like them better.

review/summary: yummy stir-fry alternative to rice
review/text: I love to make stir-fry veggies, and I almost always have them with brown rice, so I was excited to have the chance to try this noodle product made from brown rice. As soon as I got the product, my son and I put together a terrific dish with this! After reading the two recipes on the back, here is what we improvised: Chop up half a small cabbage, an onion, two cloves of garlic, two stalks of celery, a red bell pepper and a few small portabella mushrooms. Saute in about a Tablespoon of olive oil. Soak the noodles for a minute or so. Add the noodles to the mix. Add one small can of chopped anchovies, along with the oil from the can. My son put lots of red pepper (cayenne) in, and I thought it would be too much, but it was actually delicious in it. We had a package of portabella mushroom soup in the fridge, so I added about a third cup of that for flavor and moisture. With this package of Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli, a little imagination we concocted a delicious hot dinner dish. The only thing I would have added if I had some would have been some seafood--such as scallops and/or shrimp. Bits of chicken would have worked nicely, too. It was quite filling and satisying. I will probably get more of this brown rice vermicelli to keep on hand for quick dishes.

review/text: I am giving it 3 stars as being Korean and my husband Italian we love any form of pasta. I personally love vermicelli. The 7 oz bag gave in a box a size you could fit a mass volume of toilet paper in or 6 containers of laundry detergent. I can't review this product in a fair way as when I opened the overly large box and grabbed the vermicelli, it was completely in little bits. There would be no way to even try and strain this product after being cooked. there were no large intact pieces. I would not order this from amazon as this is not the first time they have had poor packaging.

But I had never used it before, and some tips for a guy like me would've been appreciated.

Cholesterol free, gluten free and fat free, soak for one minute and the vermicelli is ready for cooking - pan frying or adding to soup. I use vermicelli along with shredded bbq pork or shrimp and mushrooms as fillings for summer rolls too.<br /><br />Also try their brown rice spaghetti. Perfect if you're looking for gluten-free pasta.

review/summary: Delicious and good for you
review/text: These noodles are truly worth having on hand to use to throw together a quick meal.  The way I used them?  I had a jar of simmer sauce, and some frozen seafood mix.  Defrosted the seafood (I already had it defrosted but you can do it in cold water in 20-30 minutes), sauteed it for 3-4 minutes, added the simmer sauce and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, I softened the noodles in room temperature water for 1 minute (per the package directions) and then added the noodles for the last few minutes of the simmer time.  All told, the meal took less than 15 minutes to prepare and was so delicious everyone wanted to go back for more (although there was only enough for one serving each for my family of four).<br /><br />The noodles themselves couldn't be simpler - just brown rice, starch and water.  I love that they are made from brown rice.  It not only gives them a little better texture but makes them easier to work with than white noodles.<br /><br />Definitely will purchase again and recommend to anyone.

review/summary: okay but not as healthy as it appears
review/text: I am always looking for healthier, whole grain versions of foods I enjoy.  Unfortunately, these Peacock brand noodles are yet another food masquerading as healthy.  The product title in big letters on the front says "Brown Rice Vermicelli", making the consumer think "this is made with brown rice, so it should be a healthy choice".  But the first indication that it is not is when looking at the fiber content on the nutrition facts - only 0.6g per 2oz serving.  Then onto the ingredients list to see why so low... contains brown rice, sago starch and water.  The sago starch comes from palms and must not have much (if any) fiber.<br /><br />The Annie Chun's Maifun Brown Rice Noodles (sold on Amazon and in my local healthy grocer) has become one of my staples and is my frame of reference when comparing to the Peacock brand.  The Annie Chun's product is made with 100% whole grain, with ingredients brown rice flour and water.  Per 2oz serving, it has 4g fiber and pretty much the same calories and other nutrients as the Peacock brand.<br /><br />If you do try this Peacock brand noodles and have not used rice noodles before, you will need to seek guidance elsewhere on preparation.  As others have pointed out, the Peacock package gives almost no directions on how to prepare the product, aside from a brief mention in the recipes (in the header text it does say that they are "easy-to-cook" but does not say how).  It also contains a very strange recipe for rice noodles: Aglio Olio style - this is an Italian recipe for noodles with olive oil/garlic/sprinkled with grated cheese that I think would not be very tasty.  The second recipe appears to be for a soup with veggie strips.  Neither recipe gives amounts or much direction.  In comparison, the Annie Chun's package gives clear, specific directions on rice noodle preparation and two recipes.<br /><br />I use rice noodles = maifun = rice sticks = sometimes called vermicelli for making the Vietnamese salad "bun tofu", to serve with stir-fried veggies or in lettuce rolls.  They can also be used in spring rolls/egg rolls.  When cooking with thin rice noodles, be careful not to oversoak/overcook/overmix or they tend to disintegrate.  Asian rice noodle vermicelli (maifun) are not the same as Italian vermicelli and are not readily interchangeable.  If making an Italian recipe, the best results would be expected from Italian pasta and not maifun.<br /><br />A few final notes...  Both Peacock and Annie Chun's brown rice noodles are gluten free.  The Peacock is made in Singapore and the Annie Chun's in Thailand.  The Peacock noodles do taste fine (kind of bland), but so do the Annie Chun's.  At this time, they are both approximately the same price.  Peacock come in an plastic bag with some noodle crushage upon shipping; Annie Chun's are perfect upon removal from their cellophane bag in a box.  Overall, I highly recommend the Annie Chun's Maifun as a healthier option over the Peacock brand.  On a related note, the Annie Chun's soba and brown rice pad thai noodles are also excellent.<br /><br />Rating for this product: 2.5 stars rounded down to 2 stars.

It is very easy to make and perfect for the health conscious person who desires an alternative to rice or potatoes.<br /><br />I added shrimp to my dish and it was outstanding.  The flavor was very tasty and the product was bold versus getting over cooked.  It is a good base for consumers looking to build a nice entree for your seafood, poultry, pork or even beef.  Of course, for vegetarians you can also build a nice side dish because it is very easy to prepare.

review/summary: Great for fast meals
review/text: To prepare these, I soak them for 3-4 minutes in hot water. Then drain the noodles before sauteing them.<br /><br />My family loves them. They are nearly as quick as ramen and we like the texture and flavor a lot more. I sauteed them in olive oil with canned chicken breast, lots of garlic and some oregano and served them with cheese. The packages say 3.5 servings, but that worked out to 4 lunch sized portions.<br /><br />Pros and Cons, some of what is a pro for my family may be a con for other families and people:<br />Little flavor- also a con, they pick up other flavors very well. They do need other flavors though because they are very bland on their own.<br />Fast- Really fast. Using cooked shrimp, or other cooked meat and frozen small veggies like peas, you could have a meal ready in under 10 minutes.<br />Size- also a con, if you have a family of 4, one package is just enough noodles. If you're only cooking for yourself, or for a couple, it may be too much, and it doesn't break down easily into smaller amounts. They don't keep well once "cooked".<br /><br />We don't have gluten-restricted dietary concerns in my family, but these are gluten free if that is an issue. The picky eater in our family declared these were delicious.<br />Tomorrow I plan to try them with shrimp, temari, garlic, ginger and mushrooms. I can see these being the base for a lot of quick meals.

review/summary: Quick and Easy
review/text: Peacock's All Natural Brown Rice Vermicelli is useful if you want to make a really quick stir fry, and it also has a recipe for soup on the back of the package I want to try (with some modifications). I modified the "Brown Rice Vermicelli in Aglio Olio style" recipe (also on the package) by adding broccoli, pea pods and some other vegetables, and it was a fast and nutritious complete meal.<br /><br />The ingredients listed are simply brown rice, sago starch (a starch which is extracted from the pith of tropical palms), and water. What it gains in convenience and speed, it somewhat loses in flavor. I found it slightly "starchy" in texture, but with the right seasoning, vegetables, and seafood or  finely sliced meat, it's a good item to keep in your pantry for quick and easy meals.<br /><br />It's also good for people like me on "limited diets." Pasta is a "no no" on my very restricted regimen, but this Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli is a great way to "have my pasta and eat it too." Calories are 209 for a 2 Oz. portion (approximately 3.5 servings per bag). I'm going to enjoy experimenting with recipes where I can use this product.

review/summary: Each 7 ounce package makes a nice meal or two with additional ingredients
review/text: Each individual 7-ounce package of Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli comes with preparation instructions and two simple recipes, and contains enough vermicelli to make meals for up to two people.  I usually combine vermicelli with any two or three of the following: diced pork, shrimp, tofu, chicken, shiitake mushroom, and / or green vegetables.  Add soy sauce and other condiments when you pan cook them, or if you prefer to make soup, just add chicken broth and bring them to boil. Either way, you only have to soak the vermicelli in water at room temperature for about a minute before you start cooking.

review/summary: Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli
review/text: Not good at all. The vermicelle has absolutly no flavor on it's own what so ever. It's more of a filler for a dish. I soaked it for a minute in room temp water like it said, then put the olive oil & the garlic in the pan as directed, heated it & added my sliced peppers & shrimp, then added the vermicelli as directed. It was like a paste & NO, I didn't over cook it. Very angry as it made the rest of the dish awful so I wasted my time as well as my electric cooking it & all the other ingredients I had put into it. I would personnally NEVER buy this & if someone gave it to me I'd throw it out, as I did. Lucky for me I had other actual rice to cook to use for my remaining ingredients as I did a small amount instead of cooking all of it together just in case I didn't like it. I was able to pick out the shrimps & the peppers to save them. Those items aren't cheap to buy. You may feel differently about it but I can't imagine why since it has zero flavor.

review/summary: Not Soft Enough For My Taste
review/text: There are 2 recipes / preparation methods on the back of the package, so I tried these 2 ways:<br /><br />1. Stir Fry<br /><br />The package suggests olive oil, parsley, peppers, seafood & cheese Italian style. I don't have any olive oil, so I substituted Sesame oil & also cilantro for the parsley & went Asian style. The noodles were hard as rocks. I did pre soak.<br /><br />2. Soup<br /><br />I don't have any soup stock laying around either, so again after the recommended pre soak, I prepared the noodles in an Indian curry with lots of sauce. They were much better this way, but still too tough for my taste.<br /><br />I have eaten similar noodles at Vietnamese restaurants, & I did like them. I am also quite familiar of & approving of Brown Rice Noodles & Whole Wheat Noodles; my problem with these is the texture.<br /><br />It is possible that Olive Oil is REQUIRED; if that is the case, it should have been made more clear on the packaging.<br /><br />If you like your stir fry somewhat cement like, or your soup noodles chewy these are for you. If not....................<br /><br />One last unexpected comment: the uncooked noodles have become my boy kitty's favorite toy of the moment! He found a couple on the floor last night & had a blast stalking & torturing them before eating them!

review/summary: May be worthwhile for those intolerant to gluten
review/text: Taste is OK; texture is something like straw. It might respond to cooking the same as angel-hair pasta; but then again, maybe not: the instructions for preparation are not helpful in this regard, which is too bad for a relatively unfamiliar product not described in most cookbooks.<br /><br />The package does not re-seal or re-close; however, it contains only about 3 servings, so would usually be used up all at once anyway.<br /><br />Aside from providing a gluten-free food for those who need it, this mis-named "vermicelli" (angel-hair, more like) is healthful from the standpoint that it incorporates brown rice rather than over-processed wheat (or white rice, for that matter); however, similar health benefits, for the majority of people who are not gluten-intolerant could also be achieved in a whole-wheat product.<br /><br />With better packaging and instructions, I could give this a mild recommendation for the general consumer; as it stands, it's only for those who must avoid gluten.

review/summary: Good but not great - and NOT a purely brown rice product
review/text: It's a bit hard to rate something as bland as rice vermicelli, but here goes.  It had to be soaked before cooking, but cooked up nicely.  It has little inherent taste of its own, but works nicely with any number of other ingredients, providing nice variety.  Would we go out looking for this or buy a case at a time?  Not really.  But if we found it locally, we might buy a bag to have on hand from time to time - just not worth the price as a main food product.  It is not something we'd likely use a lot of the time.  As the title says, it's a moderately good product, just not great.  Another reviewer hit it badly for no taste - I would not have expected a substantial taste, just more of a different variety of additional food product that goes with whatever else is mixed in with it.  It will take on the flavor of whatever it's cooked with - it is NOT a stand-alone food.<br /><br />One note: it isn't worth the money.  At Amazon's price, this is selling for more than $5.00/pound yet it's not even a pure brown rice product, as one might think from the packaging.  Fortunately, due to dietary restrictions I've got, I read labels.  Read the label on this one.  It's got SOME brown rice in it....

review/summary: Fun in Stir Frys
review/text: I found Peacock's Brown Rice Vermicelli to be a fun alternative to rice in stir frys (it's rice but in noodle form).<br /><br />I only have two complaints:<br /><br />1) The directions for preparing them are poor. The bag says that the noodles only need to be soaked in water for 1 to 2 minutes, but I found that they needed at least 5 in order to be soft enough to combine with whatever else I was cooking.<br /><br />2) The noodles come in two large clumps. If you don't want to cook with an entire clump, you need to break it appart -- especially problematic when you only want to cook with a third or a quarter of a clump. It would be more useful if they came in many small clumps.<br /><br />Besides those qualms, I'd still recommend them.

review/text: The package said they don't need to be pre-soaked, but after reading other reviews, I decided that was the best route to go.  Pres-soaked for a few minutes, then I cooked with them, and they turned out pretty well.  Not sure if I would buy these (I ordered these through Vine), but they were good try try.  Added stir fried veggies and shrimp to them.

review/summary: No need to pre-soak noodles
review/text: The package said that you must pre-soak the noodles for five minutes (or whatever length of time it was) before boiling the noodles. Not necessary. My wife and I, on two occasions, just dumped some into boiling water, kept an eye on it, drained them after a period or time, and ate them.<br /><br />They were fine. They were not earth-shatteringly delicious, but then again many things that comes in bags are not. It was good, fine, adequate, serviceable, non-regrettable and I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />The instructions on the back are rather odd though. It gave me the impression that there are a limited number of recipes/dishes with which you can make these noodles, most involving top-of-the-line seafood. Again, unnecessary fuss. I think we had this with some plain Jane vegetables and seasoning. Turned out to be a nice dinner. I don't think my kids liked it, but that's kids for you.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL NOTE: I found the bag, so here's the nutritional information -<br /><br />Serving size: 56gm (2oz)<br />Serving size per container: 3.5<br />Calories: 209<br />Total Fat: 0.8g (Saturated fat: 0.3g, no trans fats)<br />Sodium: 2.4mg<br />Potassium: 3.3mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 47.1g (Fiber: 0.6g, Sugars: 2.2g, Protein: 3.2g)<br />DAILY VALUES: Vitamin C = 0.3%<br />Calcium = 1.4%<br />Iron = 3.2%<br />No vitamin A<br /><br />Ingredients: Brown rice, sago starch and water

review/summary: Overall, a good noodle.
review/text: To begin, I have to state that the package is deceiving. I was pleasantly surprised at just how many noodles fit in one package. It was much more noodles than expected. As for the taste of the noodles, it was pretty good. I prepared the noodles with a Thai curry sauce, and the flavors worked well together. My only complaint is that the noodles were incredibly thin. The texture is kind of awkward in your mouth, as it feels as if you are eating thick hair. Having said that, it wasn't a major issue, and I quickly became accustomed to the texture. Overall this brown rice vermicelli is a good choice if you are looking for a healthier alternative to traditional noodles.

review/summary: Healthy Pasta Alternative
review/text: Vermicelli rice noodles are always a great addition to soup or stir-fry.  This is my first brown rice vermicelli and it fairly similar to white rice vermicelli.  The main differences were the taste and consistency.  The taste is more flavorful and slightly nutty, like brown rice.  The consistency was less pleasing however.  This whole grain vermicelli feels tougher and denser than it's more processed counterpart, as you would expect if you've had whole wheat pasta.<br /><br />Preparing Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli is exceedingly simple.  The directions on the bag say to soak for 1 minute in cool water.  I like to use salty broth because they will soak up the flavor of the broth.  If you are eating them in soup, you are done and simply add the noodles to the soup; no cooking is needed.  For stir-fry's you'll want to toss them in a hot wok with your sauce or oil for a minute or two.  If you crisp them up, the consistency is less noticeable.

I soaked it for one minute then put it in a deep skilet and put 3/4 of a jar of tomato sauce on it and cooked until hot. It turned out good. It takes on the flavor of whatever your spices are, I suppose. It probably would have done even better if I had put the entire jar in it.

review/summary: Pretty good for a rice pasta
review/text: The first time I tried this brown rice vermicelli I was less than impressed.  It has such a fine texture and I cooked it like I would regular flour pasta in water.  I thought it was tastless and not good.  The next time I prepared it I read the package which tells you to soak it in room temp water for a minute or so before cooking.  It also has a couple of recipe ideas.  I soaked the pasta for a minute (or 3) and it didn't really seem to soften it any but I'm sure it must have helped.  Then, based on the recipes provided, I put it in a large skillet with some Asian and basalmic oil and stirred it around.  It wasn't softening as quickly I I thought so I added a little water and put a lid on it for just a minute.  Perfect!  It came out soft and had absorbed the flavors beautifully.  It made a great addition to my Asian grilled Redfish.  The texture was smooth and soft, not gritty nor gummy.  I'd recommend this product to my friends who are alergic to gluten as well as those who want a healthier alternative to pasta.

review/summary: Tastes fine, but strands are incredibly thin and preparation method is too mysterious
review/text: Let me preface this review by stating that I have never prepared vermicelli before.  That being said, I took the pack and started to boil water, figuring this stuff (which is hard and brittle out of the bag) was prepared like pasta.  When I looked at the pack for a cooking time, I didn't find any, just the following statement: "Soak vermicelli for one minute at room temperature before cooking."  Otherwise, no cooking instructions whatsoever.  Well, I soaked the stuff at room temperature for a minute and it was still hard, brittle and not especially edible, so I tossed it into the boiling water for two or three minutes and it softened up.  So I drained out the water and discovered that the bag of vermicelli was now like a soft ball of vermicelli twine that I had to cut up to eat.  I mixed the vermicelli with grated parmesan cheese and garlic sauteed in olive oil, then added some spicy chili sauce.  Overall, it ultimately tasted good, but it wasn't up to Thai restaurant caliber.  The packaging should be more explicit about how to prepare the vermicelli.

review/summary: Went from crunchy to mush
review/text: I got one package of Peacock Brown rice Vermicelli free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review of the product.<br /><br />I thought this product would be a healthy way to eat pasta, and it reminded me of Asian rice noodles when I removed it from the packet.  We like brown rice and try to eat whole grain pasta, to add complex carbohydrates to our diets.<br /><br />I soaked it for a minute as directed, then added it to a hot wok, along with sesame oil, shrimp, chopped green onion, precooked chopped bok choy, a little soy sauce and ginger.  I tossed it gently for a minute and thought perhaps it would soften up a bit with the oil and heat, but all it did was turn into a clumpy glob.  We did manage to eat some of it, and pick out the shrimp and vegetables, but none of my family liked this product at all.  It was basically tasteless in addition to being gummy.<br /><br />I've never seen any type of noodle go from crunchy and breaking into pieces, to a gummy wad of glue so fast!<br /><br />I won't be buying this product in the future.

review/text: These noodles were perfect for our family when we were on a gluten free, dairy free diet.  Its hard sometimes to locate noodles and other items on this diet and when you do, they don't always taste that great.  I found this product very simple to prepare and a great option for recipes I use for dinner.  The bag I received was a 7 ounce bag, which isn't very big.  Looking at the product description, this is a pack of 12, not just one bag.  The size is perfect for a family meal.  I'm not a huge fan of brown rice, so the taste was a little blah, but for gluten free noodles - it was ok.

review/summary: Tastes vaguely of cardboard, and the noodles went soggy fast
review/text: First off, these are skinny, skinny noodles, more slender than normal wheat vermicelli, and as such much more delicate. The bag they came in did nothing to keep them from shattering in shipping, and every time I picked up the package I felt like I was breaking them more.<br /><br />Definitely read the directions when you go to prepare them. They say to soak for one minute and then basically just heat them up in whatever dish you're making. They need pretty much zero cooking, so would be great for making fast or on-the-go meals.<br /><br />But for dinners where you are home and happy to wait, other rice noodles are better. These have a slightly dingy flavor, probably from the fact that they're made of brown rice, and get soggy and pasty super fast. They ended up soaking up so much water that they tasted watery and made my Asian-inspired sauce taste bland. I'm used to cooking Asian rice noodles since we try to eat gluten-free, and while these aren't the worst I have tried, I'd prefer most brands over this one.<br /><br />I'll give it three stars for the fact that if I were to make my own instant ramen to take somewhere, this would def. be the brand I'd choose as they don't really need to cook like other brands do.

review/text: My daughter was helping me make lettuce wraps and she soaked the entire bag of noodles before I could tell her I only wanted to use half.  We drained and refrigerated them, thinking they would most likely be mush by the time I got around to using them.  The next day, they were still firm and ready to use with no ill effects from being wet an excessive amount of time.  And, BTW, they were really good in the lettuce wraps!  We didn't have bean threads, so we decided to substitute these noodles instead.  Everyone raved over the recipe...it's highly seasoned, and the noodles absorbed all that good seasoning.  Yum!

review/summary: better than yo' mama's traditional pasta
review/text: So, I thought this would be REALLY hard to make/use with my cooking. I was DEAD. WRONG. This is SUCH a tasty and enjoyable "dish," or rather, it makes for a great dish. When you cook it - I'd HIGHLY recommend using a skillet, although I suppose one could use a wok - it picks up the flavour of the other foods around it and the seasoning just cooks into the noodle, whether you add it in after the noodles are in the skillet, or whether the seasoning from the meat (or I suppose tofu - though I've not yet tried it with tofu) seeps into the noodle. The noodle itself you only really have to soak for a minute or two to soften them, drain the "noodle," and then throw it in the skillet with your meats and/or veggies.<br /><br />There are two suggested recipes that are on the back of the package for which one can use the vermicelli. The one I based my trial off of was the seafood, but I didn't have seafood, so I just used a chicken breast that I seasoned (with garlic powder and [Mexican] chili powder - seasoned to taste preference) and cooked in a skillet. Instead of olive oil, I tried coconut oil - since a friend had recommended using that and gave me a sample - and BOTH using the coconut oil to cook the chicken AND cook the veggies and vermicelli made it taste FABULOUS! *And I am NOT a fan of coconut at all.<br />The recipe doesn't specifically call for much but chili pepper (if memory serves correct,) HOWEVER, you can add whatever you want in, I'd suggest adding it in with the garlic (or just have the veggies without the garlic) cooking over medium heat for a short bit before adding in the vermicelli and meat of choice (for now, I'd strongly suggest chicken.) Or, you can just have the veggies and vermicelli.<br /><br />However you choose to cook it, ANYONE will love it! I cooked some for a dear friend of mine when she was feeling sick and didn't want to eat anything, and she ate it and liked it - well, maybe she loved it, but I wouldn't know since she didn't express it directly - and was VERY appreciative that I shared. I also made it another time for a friend of mine who is borderline celliac; she could ACTUALLY eat it! She LOVED it and was so thrilled that I had found something else that was gluten-free and complimented me on "always finding great-tasting, gluten-free food." Anyone from any walk of life or dietary problems can eat it and enjoy it. Best part? You can mix and match the seasoning and other add-in items you so wish to cook it with.<br /><br />I'd HIGHLY recommend it and honestly, I would hands-down buy more of this the next chance I get!<br /><br />*The whole package roughly makes 4 or 5 adult servings....depending upon how big the portions are.

review/summary: Have had better
review/text: First off the noodles get very broken up from the packaging (probably the shipping and handling), so you wind up with nearly a quarter of a bag at the bottom in small pieces, the other problem is that they just do not have much flavor and they do not offer a great texture to the meal.  I tried to make these with some teriyaki and chicken stock, and they came out mushy and flavorless, they do not seem to absorb and flavor from the dish and they get soggy like and do not hold up after cooking.  I frequently enjoy making noodle dishes and have never had noodles that came out so bland and textureless as these did, even when cooked with intense flavor items.  I much prefer Maifun Rice Sticks, and will probably stick to them for future entrees.<br /><br />Maybe in certain dishes you can make use of these noodles, but for the meals that I like, I will have to continue to use Rice Sticks and Chinese Noodles.  My only other flaw with these noodles is that they get crushed in their packaging, and causes for the majority of the noodles to be broken at the bottom of the bag.

This product tastes like they processed the rice so much that they squeezed out all the flavor and left only the outer film of the rice to roll into noodles.  We mixed these noodles with sauteed veggies and shrimp with sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes but still needed to add more to get a decent flavor.  Once we did, they were fine and the meal tasted good.

review/text: I love brown rice and I love trying new foods so when I saw that they came out with a brown rice vermicelli, I knew that I had to get my hands on it. I cooked it up for dinner one night with some veggies and stir fry chicken and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. While the package makes it seem like the product will be light and fluffy, the actual vermicelli was pretty heavy and also like whole wheat angel hair pasta. Now, I love my rice sticky but there's a difference between sticky and glumpy...this was glumpy. I had my partner try it just to make sure that it wasn't just me and she said that she found it to be almost slimy. I added tons of veggies and spices and yet it seems like there was no taste. I have tried this recipe before on brown rice and it's exceptional so I knew it wasn't the recipe I used. I saved the leftovers to have for lunch the next day but when I heated it up, the noodles just got more lumpy and stuck together.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think I had a great experience with this product. While the first couple of bites were okay, the rest of the meal was a let down.

The strands are very thin, and the cooking directions are vague, so we initially overcooked the vermicelli resulting in a too soft texture.  But this was easily corrected.  Nice with regular spagetti sauce, for a variation on the usual spagetti, or try with with Asian sauces.  Really good with seasame oil.

review/text: I made a Thai curry dish and needed something to go with it for dinner.  Usually I make brown rice.  However, I was anxious to try brown rice noodles.  These are perfect.  I let it sit in a bowl with warm water for several minutes and later added the softened noodles to the curry dish.  The texture was perfect and tasted great.  I will definitely purchase again in the future

review/summary: The texture is strange. They don't cook as quickly as they say.
review/text: Honestly, I've tried very few rice pastas, but this one wouldn't win me over.  The texture was rough and grainy, even after 5 minutes of soaking in very hot water.  The directions said to warm them for 1 minute in "warm" water (no temperature indicated).  We did over 5 minutes in water at 120 degrees to no avail. The noodles were still pretty chewy and has a slightly grainy, raw-ish feel even heavily immersed in coconut milk broth.  Wouldn't buy again, especially for the price.

review/summary: Dreadful Product that Ruined a Previously Flawless Recipe
review/text: We tried this product with a favorite family recipe.  I followed the instructions for preparing the vermicelli (soak in room temperature water) before tossing it in with the various ingredients which were not very different from the two recipes on the back of the package.<br /><br />The end result was dreadful.  So bad that one person couldn't even swallow because the texture of the noodles was off-putting.  This is a recipe we've used with different types of pasta--everything from rice noodles, egg noodles, whole wheat, low carb.  This is the first and only time we hated the end result.<br /><br />Hugely disappointing there are two good things I can say about the product:<br /><br />1) The packaging opens very easily<br />2) You get a lot of vermicelli from what seems to be a small package<br /><br />Of course, what's the point of having a lot of something you don't want to eat?  And if I'd known how really bad the end result would turn out to be, I'd probably have left it in the package, no matter how easy it was for me to open.

review/summary: It tastes really good.
review/text: I have tried many types of noodles and vermicellies and this one by far the best one. It is very easy to prepare (only took me about 20 minutes to get my meal ready). The season is just enough, not too light, not to salty. And did I mention that it tastes awesome? The only drawback is that it's kind of dry. But if you have it with some sauce, it would not be a problem.

review/summary: Delicious, cooks instantly!
review/text: These noodles cooked literally in about 2 minutes, very nice and easy. They were a good flavor and texture, not rubbery at all. I put them with some veggie chicken and alfredo sauce and it paired really well. It is a big amount, and would be hard to break up or keep for leftovers, so I recommend waiting until you have a few people to feed before using it.<br />This is a great alternative to other kinds of noodles, they are much more nutritious with the same flavor. I did not brown mine (as you are supposed to do with vermicelli, I found out), and they tasted just fine.

review/summary: Chinese Take-out without the Take-out
review/text: I love to eat the skinny little rice noodles in Chinese take-out meals. I had not been adventurous enough to try making the same thing at home. Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli gave me an opportunity to do that. I combined the vermicelli with Green Giants' Valley Fresh Steamers Asian Style Medley, a pound of peeled frozen shrimp and some simple seasonings. Prep time was less than 20 minutes for four generous servings and the dish was delicious. I will use this product to make a quick meal for unexpected guests. (They'll wonder where I've hidden the take-out boxes.)

review/summary: Rice noodles for fun and profit
review/text: Ok, the title doesn't make much sense, but there isn't much to say about rice noodles.  I had hoped these had more of the earthy taste of brown rice but were just as flavorless as the white rice varieties.  That's not bad as rice noodles tend to be a binder for a dish rather than the focus.  Rice noodles rehydrate quickly in dishes making them versatile for last minute meals.<br /><br />The packing for these was disappointing.  Instead of a cardboard box, these were packed in a poly bag and had significant breakage during transit.  Additionally, the noodles were in one big lump instead of multiple smaller conglomerations thus making it hard not to cook the whole bag.<br /><br />Overall a nice choice for those looking for something a bit healthier and try to avoid overly processed products.

In this day and age of gluten issues, it is nice to use a product made of brown rice. This is also a very versatile product, and the directions gives you many different ideas. Truly you can complement it with almost any source of protein or veggies.

review/summary: A quick gluten free good choice
review/text: A dear friend of mine is on a gluten free diet, so I opted to try the sample of Peacock brand Brown Rice Vermicelli for her sake. She has tried lots of various gluten free vermicellis and has been disappointed by most.<br /><br />I've never cooked vermicelli in my life, let alone a rice vermicelli, so this was going to be a big experiment for us both.<br /><br />The package states it will make 3.5 servings, and they are right on the mark with that - full, deep soupbowl servings. There are two recipes on the back of the bag, both of which were enticing, but I didn't have all the ingredients for either, so I used what I had - grapeola oil and butter, minced garlic, roasted red pepper, and some sauvignon blanc, with fresh grated parmesan to sprinkle over.<br /><br />The only problem I had, due to lack of experience, was that I paid attention to the brief directions on the bag which said to "soften brown rice vermicelli in water at room temperature for 1 minute prior to cooking." I did this, and that's how the sauvignon blanc got quickly added to the frying pan after adding the noodles. They were still too hard and dry. In the future I would heat up some broth to just below simmer, then add the noodles for a minute - this way they would soften better and pick up additional flavor.<br /><br />However, my white wine rescue was successful, and although the vermicelli was a little chewy, it held and mixed the flavors very well. My friend said they were the best rice noodles she has come across yet, and she has tried a lot of different varieties. Because they cook up so quickly, she could grab a healthy meal with these noodles (and a few ingredients) before caving in to something bad for her digestion. She urged me to bring the bag to our nearest grocery store to see if they can find it and stock it for her.<br /><br />I was really pleased to have found yet one more healthy gluten free food item to support her well-being.

review/summary: Good rice noodles
review/text: This is a good non-gluten noodle. It held up well in cooking and can certainly substitute for wheat noodles for those who must, or simply want to, use something with no gluten in it. The noodles have no flavor of their own; none. They take on the taste of what they are cooked with. The package is also generous in quantity despite the 7 oz weight. I was cooking only for myself to test trial this for Amazon so I simply broke off a handful. One package would make me many lunches. I had it with stir fried bok choi and spinach and mushrooms with curry  but it would easily also go in an Italian direction. All in all, a good product that does what it says it does. But it does not substitute for the flavor of traditional wheat noodles. There is just no flavor of its own at all. That is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5. Aside from that it is an excellent product.

review/summary: A product in need of a better label
review/text: Before I used this product in a recipe, I read a lot of reviews here since there is not a lot on the bag. And from the negative reviews and complaints about hard noodles, what directions that are on the bag do not seem very helpful. So I went to the positive reviews and looked for guidance there.<br />My conclusion? Ignore the soaking instruction of one minute in room temp. water. Try hot or boiling water, for a couple of minutes, stirring to separate them. Then all was well.<br />I used them in a shrimp and vegetable soup and added them at the very end, cooking a little more until I felt they were done for my taste.<br /><br />That being said, I still had a couple of issues with these. The noodle are very, very, very thin. Thinner than I would like.<br />Also, the packaging, in a bag, does not provide adequate protection and a great deal of the noodle were broken to tiny, tiny pieces. Ok, for a soup I guess, but in say, a stir fry, no.<br />I looked at other brands in the store today and they all used a much stronger package to protect the very delicate noodles.<br />So not at all sure I would buy these again.

review/text: I liked this vermicelli - fast to cook and great in noodle salads and for really fast meals. As it's made with brown rice it was more apt for rice noodle dishes than for Italian vermicelli dishes, which is fine by me.<br /><br />While this is quite good, there are better packaged alternatives with larger amounts for lower prices. Shop smart, but if you want to try something different this isn't a bad option.

review/summary: Tasty and quick to cook
review/text: I tried these noodles as part of a stir-fried vegetable and noodle dish last night. I was improvising a bit since I had never used this type of noodle before, but I was quite pleased with the results. The noodles take only a few minutes to cook right there in the frying pan, they taste good, and they really absorb the flavor of any sauces you put in the pan. I used some soy sauce and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZHO">Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce</a> to make a nice spicy, flavorful dish. Again, the flavor of the sauce really does permeate the noodles, and it does so pretty evenly as long as you stir it well when you're cooking.<br /><br />One thing to note is that the package says they should be soaked in room temperature water for one minute before cooking. The noodles will *not* be ready to eat at that time. Some other reviewers seem to have been confused by this part of the directions on the packaging, and I will agree that the instructions could have been clearer. If you do soak them beforehand as directed, they should cook very quickly.<br /><br />My basic process for cooking these was as follows:<br />1) Stir fry some vegetables in large pan with a bit of oil.<br />2) Add soy sauce or other sauces as desired.<br />3) Add the noodles along with a little bit of water and stir until all of the water is absorbed.<br />4) Keep adding water, a little at a time, until the noodles are as soft as you like them.<br /><br />The "add water" step does create a little bit of trial and error, but it seemed to work out all right. By combining some vegetables, sauce, and these noodles, I was able to make a delicious meal.

review/summary: Solid Core Product, But Far From Healthy and Tasty
review/text: I am a huge fan of Italian cooking, as my slightly larger waistline will attest to, as I love to experiment with new ingredients and the Peacock "Vermicelli" (closer to Angel Hair, really) seemed like an interesting place to start anew.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my first experiment was in the heat of the moment with 20 minutes on the clock and I needed a quick bite before going to work.  Thanks to the small noodle size I was able to quickly cook the 'vermicelli' and mix it with blue cheese to make a quick meal.  It was a good meal that kept me full till I got home from work, which is good given my evening job keeps me on my feet for most of the night.<br /><br />My next experiment involved my usual spaghetti sauce al la fuente, which consists of me sauteing ground turkey in Taco Bell mild sauce with chopped pepper and Texas Pete (gives it a zesty tangy taste but neutralizes the Hispanic spices to it still tastes Italian), a very spicy but lovely sauce.  The noodles, given their gluten-free rice taste, was a very interesting mixture with my sauce as it tastes... well, bland.  In my experience, gluten-free products are typically very bland and require a literal grocery list of spices and herbs to give them any kind of flavor.  This is not necessarily a bad thing as my spices and mixtures seem to remedy the blandness, but the credit goes to my sauce and not the core product.<br /><br />Then there's the texture; it's literally like straw as it is super dry and very stringy.  Even after utilizing sea salt in the boiling water (tap water in North Dakota is notoriously bad) and using butter to dampen the noodles they still had a straw-like texture and a bland taste.  By the time I got them to taste good and feel better I had added enough extra ingredients, primarily butter, to nullify their health benefits.  It literally became a "happy heart attack meal," a term I typically reserve for anything served at Hardy's or Jack-in-the-Box.<br /><br />And don't think the fat and gluten-free labels make this thing healthy.  The 'vermicelli' are nothing but carbs and lots of them.  My mother, being a diet and nutrition expert, proved to me that noodles can be low in carbs and very low fat by purchasing certain pre-made packages that were found in the freezer at the local grocery store.  Not quite sure what they were called, but at the same cost per package as these, I will certainly go that route.<br /><br />All in all, the vermicelli was OK, albeit super bland, no texture, and a crap ton of carbs.  There are better solutions out there for less.

review/summary: Nothing special
review/text: I regularly eat brown rice and whole wheat pasta so I was interested to see how this would taste.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that it was very thin and it resembled oriental translucent cellophane noodles. I soaked the whole pack in warm water for a minute and then made a large batch of soup with it. It didn't take long to cook but the long strands did shatter into one-to-two inch pieces. I tasted the noodles before adding seasoning and it doesn't have any distinguishing taste. But on the other side, it is like Tofu, in that it takes on the taste of the seasonings and sauce that you use with it.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? No. It's too expensive for what you get. But I might consider it if I was gluten intolerant.

review/text: My wife and I tried this out last night. She's a diabetic, so brown rice is supposed to be better for her than white. We had the vermicelli with some well seasoned pieces of beef.<br /><br />My wife thought the vermicelli was OK; her only real comment on it.<br /><br />Personally, I am not fond of brown rice. At least when I have had it, it seems drier than white rice. I had the same experience with the vermicelli here, expect where the beef we added to it was in contact with it, then it was softer and tasty.<br /><br />I also prefer vermicelli that is not quite as fine as the product here.<br /><br />All this being said, the product was OK. If you like brown rice, you might even like it very much.

review/text: Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli 7 ounce pack<br /><br />At first, I didn't know what Vermicelli was, let alone how to cook and serve it.  *Mother always said there would be Days like this...* :<br /><br />There are probably millions of ways to prepare Vermicelli, but I like to keep things simple -- especially since this would be my first time with Vermicelli.  So, for this review, I took out a large pot, added an envelope of dry soup mix ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMAZS6">Lipton Recipe Secrets, Savory Herb with Garlic</a> ), 7 cups of water, lots of my favorite spices, a bit of salt, a tablespoon of real butter and a can of drained mixed vegetables.<br /><br />Brought the mixture to a boil -- lowered temp to medium.  Drained the water from the soaking (the instructions, on the package, suggest one soak Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli for a minute in water that is room temp. ) Vermicelli, and added it to the pot.  Gave the mixture a couple of stirs with a wooden spoon, and in about 3 minutes (that's all, the time, it took) all was done, smelling good and ready to serve.  :)<br /><br />I presented this wonderful little dinner with oven toasted garlic bread, a few large pitted black olives, a variety of cheese wedges and Wine of choice.<br /><br />Fast and Easy!<br /><br />The Brown Rice Vermicelli did not stick / clump, together or become gluey-- either cooking, or after being served, the color of the cooked product was aesthetically pleasing ( especially with the colorful, mixed vegetables ), and will probably look appetizing served on most any color or patterned dinnerware.<br /><br />Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli was a  Huge Hit, at my home! Everyone wanted seconds! Bon App&eacute;tit! 'nuf said.  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012

review/summary: Total Disappointment
review/text: Since I really enjoy rice noodles and I love brown rice, Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli seemed like a natural hit. Definitely not.<br /><br />Using the fry method of preparation, I followed the recipe on the package and the noodles came out tough and tasteless. They didn't absorb the flavors of the other items in the dish (I substituted scallops for shrimp), and the texture (mouth feel) was an unpleasant, rubbery blob.<br /><br />Not giving up, I tried the soup directions, using chicken stock and green onions. Again, no flavor. A mouth full of Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli is like a mouth full of nothing, but it has calories. It did not absorb the flavor of the stock or onions, but in the soup the texture was more palatable.<br /><br />Before this, I wouldn't have guessed that there was a food that had absolutely no taste characteristics. Water is more flavorful than Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli and has a much more pleasant texture (and I don't particularly like water).

review/text: The back of the package gives recipes that are not soup based, which is pretty out of the norm for my experience with gluten free vermicelli style noodles.  I decided to give it a try by tossing the noodles with garlic, pesto, and sun-dried tomatoes. The result was mush.  The noodles had no ability to stand up to cooking and had little to no taste.<br /><br />Bottom line: I would not buy these noodles. They may be OK in a soup, but I won't be spending the money to find out.
