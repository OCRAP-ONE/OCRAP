review/summary: BEST noodles EVER; BAD price.
review/text: If I was just reviewing the noodles, TEN out of FIVE stars. SERIOUSLY. I'm an Asian Noodle connoisseur, and these are BY FAR the BESTTT noodles I have ever had!!! SOOO delicious. Seeing as noodles are my favorite food, and these are my favorite noodles... These just make me happy.<br /><br />You cook them by soaking in warm-hot water until they are soft, and then cook them in whatever soup base (or pan fry with water + stir-fried veggies) and they always come out to the best chew state. Not too hard, and not mushy. They are pretty quick to make as well, so as a student they are perfect.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the price here really really REALLY sucks. You can get them for $2-4/bag, which would make $12 MAX at any Chinatown nearby (if there is one). AND you don't have to pay the (ridiculous! these are light) >$8 shipping fee to make the total well over $20.<br /><br />BUT if you do not have ANY sort of Asian food store near by, then I guess it's all right. For my favorite noodles? It would be worth it.. maybe once a year.

review/summary: OK taste but has Red Dye #40
review/text: Though I have ordered, and consumed Wel-Pac Pickled Ginger, I will not do so again.  Red Dye #40 is bad for your health, is banned in many European countries and not a necessary food additive.  Many sushi bars and restaurants will no longer serve dyed sushi ginger, there are a few brands that leave their ginger natural and pickle with organic raw sugar and vinegar.

review/summary: Love This Brand
review/text: This is the best brand of pickled ginger we have ever tried, so now it's the only one we buy. Besides eating with sushi, I enjoy snacking on it as it comes from the jar. It looks and tastes just like the kind available in fine sushi restaurants -- perfect even thin slices with just the right flavor.<br /><br />I like that it has Aspartame (Equal) as a sweeter because of the need to watch my glucose levels. Unfortunately, so many people have been taken in by controversies spread through elaborate health scares and Internet smear campaigns involving hoax e-mails. Fortunately, Aspartame is approved in over ninety countries throughout the world, so I am not worried that nay-sayers will cause it to go away. Our entire family has been using it since it was first marketed. Equal and Splenda are the only sweeteners we trust.<br /><br />On the other hand, high fructose corn syrup, which has been proven a problem for many people, is in almost all processed foods, even ones that don't require sweetening. So happy it didn't find its way into Wel-pac.

review/summary: A steal at under $37!
review/text: Sadly, I've come to think of myself as a 'bully stick connoisseur.'  Some bullys are too thin, some not the length promised, and others stink to high heaven.  At under $37 for 15 braided twists of 3 TRUE 6" bullys which seem low odor, these are a steal.  My dog will mow down a bully stick in about 10 minutes.  These last about 30 minutes, so we get 3x the value.<br /><br />You can bet we'll be back for more!

review/summary: Great price for a great chew
review/text: I've gotten these in a stick form before from my local specialty pet store & my dog tore through it.  He's a 1 year old lab so I wanted something that kept him entertained longer than 10 minutes (the time it took him to get through a typical bully stick.  These fit the bill.  He works on it for a bit, getting it to "un-braid" & then has 3 individual sticks to work on.  These keep my active chewer busy for a long time.  They have a mild odor while he's chewing on them (and they get wet) but normally they don't have a smell (and the mild odor isn't unpleasant).<br /><br />Anyway - for the price, these are a great deal.  I'm about to order my second batch & figured I should write a review at the same time. :)

review/text: This coffee tastes fairly good for sugar-free decaf, but its first two ingredients - which are present in the largest quantity -  are very unhealthy for people's cardio-vascular system: PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED COCONUT OIL, CORN SYRUP SOLIDS.<br />One would think that at the price General Foods charges for it, they'd manufacture something that people could drink a few cups/day without worry. It seems they pay more for the pricey metal tin, than better ingredients. I would not mind at all buying the coffee in a nice bag instead.

I was dismayed to find all of the large supermarkets in that area do not carry the decaffeinated Suisse Mocha Coffee Drink Mix made by General Foods International.  Then I said to my self.  Where did you find the Campbell's Butternut Squash soup?  Amazon.com.  I got on the computer and sure enough there it was -  my decaffeinated Suisse Mocha.<br /><br />I am so thankful everyday that I usually can find "hard to find" items on Amazon.  The delivery is fast, the product is packaged wonderfully and the product is delicious.  Thank you again Amazon.com<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Carolyn Delaware

review/summary: Apparent Change in Formulation
review/text: My wife has been drinking Decaffeniated, Sugar free Suisse Mocha (General Foods International Coffee) for years, but the latest batches we purchased are significantly different than earlier mixes.  The coffee has a much sweeter and very unpleasant flavor.  In addition, after drinking a small amount from three different cans, she became quite nauseated.  At first we thought we had simply gotten a bad batch when we ordered through Amazon, but we purchased more from a local grocery store and it was the same story.  We also noticed that a label on top of the cans now reads: "Coming up this summer! Look for our same great-tasting, indulgent cafe-style beverages under our new name:  Maxwell House International Cafe."<br /><br />From this, I assume General Foods has sold "International Coffees" to Maxwell House.  Whatever has happened, the change in formulation has ruined what was an excellent beverage.  I realize taste is a matter of personal preference, but the fact that the coffee mix made my wife ill (three different cans of it, purchased from different places) leads me to believe that others should avoid this product.

review/summary: I wish that it was healthier
review/text: This product is the perfect way to end my breakfast and linger over Suduko.  I try not to drink anything with caffein because it keeps me awake all night.  In addition, I am very concerned about calories.  This is a wonderfully tasting treat which is very low in calories.  But it is too good to be true.  The first ingredient is a partially hydrogenated oil which makes it not such a good choice.  It is the only thing that I use with partially hadrogenated oil so I have one cup a day.  If it was made without the oil, I would use it all day long.  Maybe they can remove the ingredient. The flavor is marvelous.  It mixes a little slowly, but don't give up because eventually it all dissolves.

review/text: I bought three flavors just to try them out, this flavor was good. I liked them. If your looking for a sweet snack that is filling and yummy I'd go with the Cinnamon flavor, LOVE those. I would NOT buy the Zesty ranch, those tasted awful. All packs are low in carbs and sugar and have good amounts of fiber and protein.([...])

review/summary: Extend Crisps White Cheddar
review/text: Nutritionally speaking, these snacks are pretty good. At 130 calories, 4g fat, 16g carbs, 3g fiber, and 8g of protein, they seem like they live up to the claims on the product package. They "control hunger," and help you "avoid blood sugar highs and lows." Unfortunately, to me, it was like eating cardboard. They texture is like packing peanuts, and the taste isn't much better. They are rather bland, and I couldn't taste even a hint of white cheddar. Now, I've eaten many products of this type before, and I don't expect them to be gourmet or taste like regular snacks, but I cannot eat these crisps. They might be better in another flavor, but the white cheddar crisps are not edible, in my opinion.

review/summary: Didn't love them...
review/text: I'm on a low-carb diet and was looking for some low-carb snacks to get me through my hunger spells. I thought that white cheddar would be a good flavor, but upon receiving my order and trying them, I can't bear to continue eating them. The flavor is very artificial tasting and kind of sweet! I don't mind the texture of them though, they remind me of rice cakes. Also, these snacks are better suited for a diabetic, not someone on a low-carb diet - each bag actually has 16g of carbs!

review/summary: Quick, Easy, Tasty Variety Pack
review/text: I'm not going to begin by comparing these to home-made mashed potatoes.  They're not, nor will they ever be.  But they are a very tasty side in their own right.<br /><br />These work great as a quick addition to a meal, or as a snack all on their own.  I eat these for lunch occasionally, and they're great for camping/hunting/etc.  All you have to do is pour them into the container of your choice, and boiled water, and let it absorb.  The nice thing is you don't really have to measure, either.  Just add water until the potatoes are of the consistency you want.  Make sure to stir thoroughly while you do though, because otherwise you may end up with powder spots in the middle which aren't very enjoyable.<br /><br />With the variety pack, you get enough different flavors that you don't get tired of them as quickly, and all of them are fairly good.  Definitely worth it for their taste and convenience.

review/text: Due to working two jobs, I needed something that could sit on the shelf without going bad. Found them on sale for $1.00 a pouch at my local grocery store. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. With just two cups of water and a microwave safe bowl I had an instant side dish, or on late nights an actual meal. I have tried all the varieties and have liked each one. Quick and easy, perfect for the family on the go that needs to add variety to their meals. I will admit I do add a bit of pepper for a little kick to it, but many will find this perfect straight from the pouch.  I have even added to home made mashed potatoes to stretch them when unexpected guests have shown up for dinner. They are light weight so a great addition to backpacking trips and emergency survival packs. I would recommend this to everyone.

review/text: This is the best commercially available beef jerky around. It's drier than most products out there (Pemican, Jack Daniels) and much more authentic. Sadly, it seems that Trader Joe's has stopped carying it and started using their own, inferior brand. Honestly, it'g going to reduce the number of trips I make to trader joe's by 1/2. Anyway, if you like authentic beef jerkey (like the kind you used to find in the glass jars at gas stations) this is the only brand for you!

review/summary: Great Jerky
review/text: I can't claim that this is the best tasting Jerky for anyone since everyone has their own opinion/tastes, but I am not afraid to admit that I buy beef Jerky anytime I see it within reach.<br /><br />Been a huge fan of beef jerky since I was a little kid since I was on plenty of road trips from New Mexico to Colorado because of family.  Jerky was the perfect snack.  From 20 years ago to now, I always have had a passion for Jerky and never surprised by any Jerky until this came around.<br /><br />Was only able to find this Jerky in my company's cafeteria.  Then they stopped carrying it and immediately looked online to find it.  Yes it might be expensive, but its totaly worth it.  Even their customer service is great because one time I got a bad package from the cafeteria and reported it on their site.  They ended up sending me 4 fresh packages (all different flavors) to make up for it.<br /><br />This is worth a try if you want something new.  Unfortunately I can't afford to get this all the time.  Maybe its a good thing because I ordered 2 orders of the Jerky (24 packages) and went through it in 3 days.

review/text: I discovered Snackmasters Beef Jerky almost 10 years ago at BJ's.  They stopped carrying it several years ago and now only stock Slim Jim and Pemmican.  I couldn't find Snackmasters anywhere and tried every other brand of jerky I could find - Jack Link's, Trader Joe's, anything I found.  Nothing compared.  Finally, for Christmas 2008, my wife got me a couple bags of Snackmasters straight from the company and I have to say, it's still the best.  It tastes like what I imagine jerky is supposed to taste like - seasoned, dried beef.  Everything else is soft and greasy; Snackmasters requires a lot of chewing and the flavor is perfect.  I'm glad Amazon is carrying it now.

review/text: I had been feeding Blue Buffalo Wilderness wet food to my dog for about 9 months with mixed results. Two months ago, I noticed white chucks of matter that I did not recognize and had not seen before in the food. After contacting Blue Buffalo customer service, I was told that these items were bone fragments (even though the BB website claims that they use no animal by-products). Last month I discovered a 2" x 3" piece of packing tape/heavy paper inside the can with the wet food. I did a fair amount of research online and decided to stop feeding my dog BB and only use dog food from companies that do not outsource their manufacturing.

One of our dogs, a minature schnauzer, is SUPER picky about what he'll eat...some days he'll eat his food other days he won't. Since switching to Blue (we feed a mix of dry Blue Salmon grain free and canned) he eats every time. Also, I LOVE the high quality of this food. Our dogs are our family and it makes me feel good to be able to provide them with such good nutrition. I highly recommend the Blue Buffalo products.

review/summary: Great for my dog's sensitive stomach
review/text: My lab has a very sensitive stomach, and for the first year that we had her we were at the vet every month because we could not get her gastrointestinal system under control.  We were feeding her Purina Pro Plan dry, which is what the breeder started her on, and sometimes it gave her no problems, and sometimes she had horrible diarrhea.  The vet put her on prescription food to make her more regular, which usually worked, and then when we'd switch her back to the Purina she'd be fine for 2 weeks, and then get sick again.  I started looking into alternatives to regular dog food, without wanting to commit to cooking her chicken and rice two times a day or keeping her on the prescription pet food forever.  I found some great reivews of the Blue Buffalo Wilderness formula, tried it, and we haven't looked back.  Right now she's eating a combination of the wet and dry salmon recipe.  It has made her much more regular, we haven't been to the vet for a stomach ailment since we made the switch, and she loves it.  The dry food smells funny, but the wet food smells just like canned salmon that humans would eat.  The appearance of the food is not consistent from can to can, but I think that's okay because that just tells me that the food isn't over-processed.  Even though this food is a little more expensive, it's still cheaper than monthly vet visits and medication.

review/text: i was not impressed one bit with this stuff. if it was any thinner you could pour it out of the can. i tried chicken soup for the dog lovers soul and it was an instant success with my dogs. actually had to break it up with a spoon. also it is much cheeper than blue buffalo and the quality is right up there with all other designer dog foods. most importantly it's also made in USA.

review/text: I tried writing a review previously but I focused on how recieving a bottle w a busted cap and dents on my product didnt make me super happy. I wasnt going to have a container once I took off the foil cause the cap was busted...so I got a plastic container and dumped syrup in there for storage. Tonight,  I made a mint julep w the syrup. Its wasnt a HORRIBLE drink, but its not a mint julep to me. It just didnt taste like the ones Ive had. Taste combined w a shabby bottle didnt work for me.

review/summary: Incredibly delicious!
review/text: Yes it's bright green, yes it is full of sugar, but by gum is this mint syrup delicious! Like several other reviewers, I grew up in Europe where this can be considered a fairly common drink. Most caf&eacute;s in France, Belgium and even Italy will carry a mint syrup, and no, they don't use it in coffee! Add a dash (or four) to cold water (flat or sparkling) and you have created what is easily one of the most refreshing drinks imaginable. The mint tastes is not overly sugary, making it excellent as a cocktail mixer/modifier (alcoholic or virgin). Use Teisseire mint syrup to add a punch in flavor and presentation!<br /><br />I highly recommend that you give this sirop de menthe a try!!

review/text: Teisseire is a French company that still makes the best syrups out there, with no nasty ingredients in them. High quality products for at least 20 years!<br /><br />Mint syrup is my favorite, and I used to drink a ton of it when I lived in Belgium and France. Add it to ice water or, even better, to sparkling water for delicious, refreshing soft drink. Highly recommended! And if you'd like to try another flavor, get the grenadine flavor (that one can be added to vanilla ice cream for a delicious treat).

review/text: We all love Teisseire syrups in our family. I grew up in France and my grand-mother used to serve me these drinks during summer. Now, my parents bring these when they come visit from France for my kids. I love that I can find the syrups on Amazon too as they're pretty heavy to carry in a luggage! My favorite flavors are mint, grenadine and anis. These are the classic flavors but the truth is that they are all amazing. All the fruity flavors are great: strawberry, red fruit, orange, lemon, etc...

review/summary: A Really Good Wine For People On A Budget
review/text: Cabernet is by far my favorite wine, and I chanced upon Rex Goliath at my local Publix Supermarket, on sale for $6.19 a bottle.  Having recently learned that I have been hired for a great job, I bought a bottle to celebrate.<br /><br />As someone who has become accustomed to Oak Leaf and "Three-Buck Chuck", this was a change for me; spending twice the usual price for wine.  I know, I know, wine snobs will laugh, but try keeping up a wine habit with no income.<br /><br />But I digress...Rex Goliath was uncorked and shared with great enjoyment and delight.  It is very smooth, yet still as full as you expect a Cabernet to be.  I was very pleased with the taste, and the bottle was finished off in quick fashion.<br /><br />I will be purchasing this wine again, gladly.  And now that I am employed again, it can become my every day wine, as it is affordable as well.

review/summary: Just Trust Them
review/text: While they have a few mustards to choose from I picked this one solely as a dare, to the Fallot people, to disappoint me.  I've had their Dijon and their Dijon with Peppercorn so I knew that they knew what they were doing.  When I saw the Gingerbread variant I figured it was the LEAST appealing.  For me that is always a sign of a way to expand my horizons so I went for it.  It is excellent.  The more detailed ingredients include wheat and spices.  It's not the gingerbread taste I was expecting, which is a good thing.  It is dijon with a very unique zip to it.  I put it on ham with a whole grain wheat bread.  I prefer high tech ingredients like Boar's Head rosemary & sundried tomato ham but it's too delicate for this particular mustard so just use a basic high quality meat.  Serve it to yourself though, unless you know someone who is a total "foodie."  I paired it(LOL) with a French beverage in the form of a Citadelle gin martini.  Look to the French for food and art and you won't be disappointed,

review/summary: A Holiday Tradition
review/text: Every November I stock up on Trappist preserves and jellies for my holiday baking. Why use fresh butter, eggs, and real sugar if you fill your thumbprint cookies with inferior jelly from the grocery store? Whatever you spread with Trappist jam, jelly or preserves is elevated beyond mere food. When nobody's looking, I've been known to spoon it out of the jar and eat it -- it's that good. My favorite is the Ginger although it goes very quickly when it's available. The conserves with the walnuts are also excellent. Giving jam or jelly as a gift may seem silly, but once you and your gift recipient open up a jar, you'll be convinced.

You can read more about some unique features of the process on the Amazon site.)<br /><br />And the money you spend actually goes to support the life and work of the monks.

The only down side I see here is the price, I just bought a single container 'on sale' at my local healthy food store for $1.50 each,and I was hoping to find a comparable price in this site if I bought in bulk.  However, I will not make a purchase today due to price.

review/text: I've had regular, lychee and now this flavor. I found it to be very bland. I did taste peach and mango but it seems the slightly bitter green coconut water canceled out the sweetness and depth of its two added fruits. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  Naked seems to have the truest green coconuts -- when they're so young the water isn't sweet most of the time. I don't mind the taste and love the benefits of drinking coconut water. It's great on a hangover day to rehydrate quickly.
