review/summary: Some flavors are better than others
review/text: As a clean-eating vegan, I can't help but love everything about Larabars. Most of them taste great, and you can't beat an ingredient list this short. Of all the vegan flavors, I have to say the peanut cookie is the BEST. Ginger snap and apple pie are also great. The blueberry muffin is heinous, though. Steer clear of that one!

review/text: The pecan pie bars are delicious. In texture and taste they are exactly like classic pecan pie filling. These things are so good I wrote the company fan mail. Hopefully they will not respond with a restraining order, I was pretty effusive. If you like pecan pie you should be pretty impressed by these bars.

review/text: As other reviewers have noted, when they say lemon flavor they mean lemon flavor.  But, my God, are they ever good!  I've tried the cherry and the apple but the lemon are my favorites.  You might even get your kids to eat them.<br /><br />The ingredient list is the kicker--only five items (dates, cashews, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, natural lemon flavor).  Not a bunch of artificial flavors, high-fructose corn syrup, preservatives and the like.

review/summary: a life saver for those on a gluten-free diet
review/text: recently diagnosed with celiac, I've had to restructure my whole vision of food and snacks and how to stay healthy.  I've never had luck with nutrition/meal replacement bars in the past (can we say cardboard?), so I was leery when those on the celiac support boards kept singing the praises of Larabars.<br /><br />I picked up my first one at Whole Foods, and was worried with the high nut content -- I'm not known to be fond of nuts.  but after one bite, I discovered I LOVE nuts -- if they are in a Larabar.  the cherry bars are sweet and sure at the same time, just like fresh cherries.  the dates and nuts balance out the flavor experience.<br /><br />unlike other bars, these are soft and tasty, and beyond filling!  I can usually only nibble half at a time.  but now, I have something to keep in my purse or in my desk at work for emergency food.  everyone else can have a sandwich with their wheat filled bread, and I'm perfectly happy to munch away on my Larabar.

review/summary: The perfect snack.
review/text: No gluten, no added sugar, raw, vegan... You'd think these would be pretty darn bland and nasty. Well, you'd be wrong. They are amazing! Sometimes simple and natural is better, and this is one of those cases. I far prefer these to any of the fancy energy bars like Luna Bars, Clif Bars, etc. They are simply nuts and dried fruit, they satisfy my sweet tooth and also give me the energy I need to get through the day. I eat them as a mid-morning or mid-afternoon stack. Cherry Pie is by far the tastiest flavor. It is tart and tasty.<br /><br />I'm confused about why these aren't listed in Amazon's Gluten-Free section, though?

review/summary: Rich and Satisfying Bars without Fake Sweeteners
review/text: I'm on the go and trying to keep healthy and fit by making sure I eat at regular intervals. I tried the "energy" bars and "nutrition" bars, but they all have fake sweeteners with that nasty aftertaste. Saw the Larabars in the grocery store and picked up a few different flavours to try. WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />If you are a big chocolate lover, I would just warn you that these don't taste like a chocolate bar - the combination of cocoa and chili powder is really more like a Mole sauce you get in Mexican cooking - rich, but not at all sweet. And the chili powder is not enough to be hot or spicy.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar.

review/summary: WONDERFUL SNACK, BUT NOT ORGANIC
review/text: Gee:  Something relatively healthy that tastes this good has got to be a crime, no?  The only prob. is that I adore these, but cherries are heavily sprayed...so if you're looking for Organic foods, you're better off with the Think Organic cherry nut bars.  The problem THERE is that I am somewhat allergic to Cashews and the Think Org. bars are loaded with them!  Larabars  use Almonds, which is no problem for allergies, just for chemical sprays.<br /><br />Darn it, guys, why doesn't someone come up with a relatively hypoallergenic product that is also ORGANIC????  When you do, your bars will be my most favored product of the century!!! Otherwise, the Cherry Pie Larabars are unbelievably yummy and raw food, which is always good.

review/summary: Chocolate Coconut
review/text: I cannot say enough about Larabars. Simple ingredients, whole ingredients, and a great snack. However, the one caveat is that the ingredients are not organic and that is why I am providing a 4 star rating. Some foods like Dates with very thin skins I would prefer to have an organic option. I wish that they would offer an organic version of this bar. However, they do taste amazing and are probably one of the best options out there if not the best. These are perfect for me at University for between classes when I am on the go and do not have enough time to go to the cafeteria quite yet.<br /><br />I would recommend trying the flavors before you buy a whole package, however if your willing to take a plunge, the top flavors I have tried so far have been Chocolate Coconut Chew, Coconut Cream Pie, Cinnamon Roll, and Cashew Cookie in that order. Some flavors such as Apple Pie, Cherry Pie, Key Lime Pie, I find can get old a lot faster and I would probably not go through a 16 box of them before I got somewhat sick of them.<br /><br />PROS<br />+Very tasty (LOVE the Chocolate Coconut Chew and the Cinnamon Roll).<br />+Simple ingredients.<br />+Whole food ingredients.<br />+Small, portable.<br />+Price is very reasonable.<br />+Filling.<br /><br />CONS<br />+No organic option.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />The price at Amazon is superb compared to elsewhere, you probably won't find anything in this price range at this quality, from what I have experienced. They are a good snack when you are on the go, perfect for a University student at that. Simple, whole food ingredients, the way it is meant to be. Definitely recommended. Will get a 5 star rating once they release an organic version!

review/summary: know the facts
review/text: These bars are not marketed as a diet aid.  They are organic raw food bars. Made mostly of fruit and nuts, Larabar products do not hide the fact that natural ingredients have calories and fat.  But can they be part of a healthy diet? Definitely. Taste is subjective - I myself happen to enjoy the flavor, but none of Larabar's products are going to taste like a Milky Way. When you're tempted to go for the really bad stuff, it's nice to have these around, but it helps if you like the taste of the natural ingredients.

It tastes EXACTLY like dates and nuts because it IS dates and nuts. It's great if you like DATES and NUTS.<br />Don't be romanced by Illusions...and if you find that you are, remember..I TOLD YOU SO!

review/summary: These are the best
review/text: I heard about these bars from the author of The Lupus Recovery Diet.  She<br /><br />sent me a bar with my recent CD purchase and I loved it.  I have since purchased bars at Whole Foods and was so pleased to see them offered here.<br /><br />The Pecan Pie tastes so wonderful.  Just like a piece of pecan pie.  My<br /><br />favorites are the cinnamon roll and chocolate coconut.<br /><br />I read the other review regarding calories and fat, but these bars are healthy and so filling.  I have one for breakfast on the run, or as a mid<br /><br />afternoon snack.  With a plant based diet, I am not concerned about the calories and find the bars so satisfying. These are the best tasting bars I have ever tried.  It sounds like a commercial, but I honestly am in love with this product.  I have ordered 4 cases for our household.  My kids love them too and they are way better than the cookies and other sweet processed snacks offered for lunches.

Pecan Pie, Peanut Butter Cookie, Pistacio.  Pistaci, yo!

review/summary: Good, but Flavor Names Not Always Appropriate
review/text: I've grown to really like these bars, but the flavor names are a bit misleading.  I've had the apple pie, which is appropriately named, the jocalat(chocolate) I think will be disappointing to most in the beginning if you're really expecting true chocolate taste, but the actual flavor does grow on you, and the pecan pie is really delicious but it doesn't taste anything like pecan pie.  It's more like a very tasty, nutty, gooey date bar.  So if you don't get your hopes up with the flavors, I think you'll like them very much, AND they are truly wholesome and are perfect for the Paleo Diet.

review/summary: Amazing New Flavor
review/text: Peanut Butter and Jelly Larabars is a new flavor (to me, anyway, because I just discovered them in the stores here).  They are really awesome.<br /><br />I admit, I've never been a fan of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with light bread, but I LOVED peanut butter and jelly on graham crackers.  Now that I've gone vegan, I can't eat peanut butter and jelly or graham crackers, but this PB&J Larabar tastes just like the peanut butter and jelly on graham crackers that I used to eat.  And even for non-vegans, these bars are still good - anybody can eat them.  They taste just like whatever the flavor is, and are healthy (even though you'd never know it, because they taste so good!)<br /><br />These bars are healthy, natural, soy-free, vegan, kosher.  They have no added sugar, and no chemicals.  It is amazing how something so natural and simple can be so good.<br /><br />Larabars are good to pack for trips, lunches, or anytime you need some energy (or just food); they are convenient because you don't have to cook, measure, slice, or stir, and you don't need a container with a special lid.  You don't need anything!  You just open and eat!!!  All the flavors are good for energy or hunger-control, but when I am really hungry, my favorite flavors are peanut butter cookie and peanut butter and jelly (the featured flavor in this particular review).  The ones with peanut butter (not really peanut butter, but just peanuts) seem to give me more energy.<br /><br />I love all flavors of Larabars (I haven't yet discovered a flavor that I didn't like), but I do have my favorites, depending on the mood I'm in.  Like I mentioned in the prior paragraph, Peanut butter cookie and peanut butter and jelly are my favorites if I am really hungry.<br /><br />All the flavors of Larabars are healthy, and even though they have no added sugar, they certainly crave my desire for sweets (because they do taste like they have sugar, even though they don't).  I am not really a big "sweets" eater; I prefer salts.  If I could just have salty foods all the time, I think I could totally give up sweets.  But even those who do love sweets, I think these bars would satisfy their sweets desire, also, because they taste like whatever the flavor is.

review/summary: Jackpot
review/text: The Peanut Butter and Jelly LARABAR is really, really good. The company struck gold with this one. If you are a fan of those sandwiches, you'll dig these as an on-the-go-snack. I just have a few minor gripes: one is that I like to "stretch" Larabars  (while still in the wrapper), because they're usually a little fat and brick-like and it makes them last longer/more fun to pick at, but when you smoosh this particular flavor out, it gets a quite crumbly (think pieces of peanut popping out); so, it's not as blended as other flavors. Also, it'd be nice if it were a bit saltier -- sometimes you just crave that, especially if it's a meal replacement and you're in a peanut-butter-and-jelly mood -- and a little protein-heavier. Finally, I really wish the entire Larabar line (not just Jocalat) was organic! That would really be awesome. But, these are nitpick-y things. You'll like this flavor -- a lot. In full disclosure, I haven't ordered them on Amazon, but I believe after eating my first one, I told whoever was in the room with me to please buy me a box of them because it was "SO. GOOD." So, go for it.

review/text: These things are amazing. Healthy, instant, tasty, and pretty inexpensive at ~$1.50 per bar. They are free of dairy, gluten, meat, soy, etc and are raw, so almosy anyone can eat them.<br /><br />Now onto the flavor analysis. The first flavor I tried was Key Lime Pie. It was really, really good. Next I tried Cherry Pie. It wasn't as good, but with its strong flavor I found it to be the perfect companion to a few pieces of dark chocolate. When I had women over (I'm a young single bachelor) I'd share with them some dark chocolate and a cherry pie larabar and they would almost get as much enjoyment from that as they did from me. I just opened my new box of Lemon and it is easily my favorite flavor so far. Incredible, I don't want to risk trying another flavor because lemon is so good. My roommate preferred the lime but says the lemon is his second best.<br /><br />So to recap: these are good, buy them.

review/text: I got these when Amazon was running a very good promotion, so it worked out to something like .60 a bar.  These have a really nice, tangy taste (the cherries) and a really satisfying chewy texture. I like that it's pretty natural and simple ingredients (grounds nuts, cherry, dates etc.), but for my preference, it's a bit too high in fat.  I like my energy bars to have no more than 3 grams of fat (or 4 max), while these have 8 (but then again, those lower fat bars don't taste as good as these).  ;-)<br /><br />I would try another flavor of these if there was another good sale and if I could get any that were lower in fat.

review/summary: Essential, HONEST Nourishment in a Delicious Flavor Assortment
review/text: Ginger Snap is my favorite of the Larabars. For me it seems to provide the epitome of potency these bars have available.<br /><br />The combination of Ginger and Cloves with the nuts and dates, seems to give a cleansing, balancing, renewing, and empowering type of immediate, essential nourishment. I'm amazed at how fast this flavor will give me a solid physical strengthening when I'm lagging from having pushed too close to draining past ready reserves. After just a few luxuriously flavorful bites, I can feel an amazingly positive effect.<br /><br />What I noticed with tremendous relief, and a significant amount of awe upon first reading the wrapper on these bars was the basic, clear ingredients listing along one side, with the "NO SOY, NO GMO" noted on the other side. I had begun to believe that I'd never see a label which would give me that type of refreshing feeling of finally being able to eat something without fear of how much it would contribute to an already painful situation of serious health issues. To find that it would contribute instead to healing and strengthening had literally rekindled a lost concept.<br /><br />With the huge variety of simple, sane, satisfying flavor blends available in this line of tasty and true nutritional offerings, I enjoy asking myself what I most have a taste for at any moment when I need a solid [not pseudo with a skull-and-cross-bones price tag] energy lift. [I always carry at least 4 flavors in my purse.]<br /><br />I don't know what else to say except that I feel blessed, and that I tremendously appreciate what Lara has had the inner wisdom, creative versatility, and visceral fortitude to accomplish.<br /><br />Well done, Lady!<br /><br />Live long and prosper,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt

review/text: Great Bar. Tastes like banana bread with only 3 ingredients. I've tried cashew cookie, and cherry pie, and even though they taste good, they don't need to match the taste of something as distinctive as banana bread. This bar amazingly tastes like banana bread without bread!<br />My boyfriend doesn't like dry bars, and this one is nice an moist. I took it snowboarding as a small snack and it doesn't get frozen solid. I plan on buying this flavor often.

review/summary: COLLEGE STUDENT'S BEST FRIEND
review/text: These kept me healthy through college - a GREAT studying snack, because the fruit and nuts both keep you energized and facilitate brain function (at least that's what my nutritionist friend told me). End result was I graduated engineering in 3.5 years with a great GPA! And I did not gain weight like most of my dorm buddies, even though I had very little time for exercise. Seriously - send your kid a pack of these instead of cookies or candy, they will thank you!<br /><br />My favorite bar was lemon - although I think that's a personal preference. Haven't tried all of them, but I mean too. My new husband and my father both need a health makeover (one needs to watch glycemic impact, the other needs to watch fat & sodium), but both love junk food, and so I'm going to try and get them into these too!

review/summary: Cherry Pie Larabars -- love them!  (and also other flavors)
review/text: I have been on a long quest for "nutrition bars" (or whatever you want to call them) that don't have refined sugar, aren't too sweet (however they're sweetened), don't have soy, and generally don't have extra crud in them. These are perfect!<br /><br />I like the flavor, and I like that the ingredients list is so short: "dates, almonds, and cherries". (200 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber. See larabar dot com for more.)<br /><br />They are a little bit gooier/processed than I was expecting... I had to check after a taste that there wasn't soy in there gluing everything together. But when I think about fruit leather that makes sense. In some ways, it's like a thick fruit leather with some larger bits of fruit and nuts.<br /><br />But I'm really glad to find them and will be trying more flavors. This is just the sort of bar I was hoping for.<br /><br />Update: My next favorite flavor so far is Chocolate Coconut Chew, which should not be mistaken for a candy bar-type snack, as I feared it might. It's not that sweet and not that chocolately. It's more substantial. Ingredients: "Dates, almonds, walnuts, unsweetened cocoa powder, unsweetened coconut". 240 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber... and I'm sorry I don't have the energy right now to type the rest. (Ah! But you can get it online if you put a dot com after larabar!)<br /><br />I also like Ginger Snap enough to have bought a box. They are, yes, a little cookie-ish (though with the same gooey consistency as the rest). I do love ginger, but I don't find myself reaching for this flavor and probably won't reorder. Ingredients: "Dates, almonds, pecans, ginger, cinnamon, cloves". 240 calories, 5g protein, 6g fiber.<br /><br />Other flavors I have tried (Note that I prefer less sweet things, although all of them have a dose of sweet)<br />  * Tropical Fruit Tart: I won't get this again; for me this was like a pina colada and not what I want in a food bar (partly, this means it was too sweet for me, but also all the desert-y flavors in that bar)<br />  * Peanut Butter and Jelly: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Cashew Cookie: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Lemon Bar: Too desert-y for me. Sweet and lemony.<br /><br />(Looking at the larabar web site, Peanut Butter Cookie has the most protein, with 7g, at 220 calories and with 4g fiber... I haven't been able to get that in my local stores yet, but that will be the next flavor I try.)<br /><br />Update 2: So I have bought a few flavors by the box now... but I'm realizing I wonder why these aren't cheaper here. They are 1.39 individually in my grocery store, and 1.27 a piece by the box at the current subscribe and save price of 20.28. So yes, that's a savings, but possibly not enough to buy in bulk.

review/summary: Great GingerSnap Flavor-- real fruit and nuts with NO JUNK
review/text: These might be the best-tasting bars I've ever tried. They keep pretty well, too, although if you leave them in your car (in the heat) they will lose freshness will get hard quickly. They are great as a meal replacement when you don't have time for lunch and you need to grab something satisfying that won't spike your blood sugar and make you feel sick later on. This is a sustained energy-- I think it's the nuts that help it have a lasting energy feeling. The calories in these is always about 300, which is good for a meal replacement.<br /><br />I really love the ginger snap, which tastes just like a real gingersnap cookie and you can taste the real ginger. Although most Larabars are very delicious, and I can't say I have ever disliked any of them.

review/text: I'm a fan of Larabars and the peanut ones are my second favorite.  All of them have only a few ingredients (less is better) and no preservatives or additives. Although I was quite surprised by the price of a box of 16, which pretty much equals over two bucks a bar.  My local grocery store sells them for one dollar, thirty-nine cents.  The health food store sells them for a dollar fifty-nine. That can mean a lot of savings.

review/summary: The "tastier" fruit and nut bar
review/text: Obviously a lot of people like this bar, myself included, so I thought I'd review it a bit differently.  When I was searching for a healthier between meal afternoon snack I read a lot of reviews for a lot of products.  I wanted something with few ingredients, not "fortified" and with some nuts in it.  I settled on these Larabar Fruit & Nut Cherry Pie bars and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P504ZG">Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry Living Food Bar</a>.  I love cherries and I love blueberries so they seemed like good choices.<br /><br />The stats of the bars are very similar, weight (both 1.7oz, not 1.8), calories, fat, sugars, etc.  The PURE has more protein at 6g vs 4g.  The Larabar has no sodium while the PURE has just a bit at 5mg.  The Larabar is thicker, the PURE bar is wider.  Visually the Larabar appears to have more nuts in it, which doesn't seem to jive with the protein stats.  The PURE bar has a grittier texture while chewing so maybe more of the nuts are finely ground.<br /><br />1st ingredient is dates for both followed by almonds and then cherries for the Larabar and followed by blueberries and various nuts, organic agave nectar, rice protein and lemon juice for the PURE bar.  One would think with the extra ingredients in the PURE bar they were added to tweak the flavor or give it a fresher taste, but the flavor of the Larabar is better than the PURE by a pretty good margin.  It has a much fresher and lively taste.  I have to say the PURE bar is a bit cardboardy tasting to me and has a drier mouth feel.  It is not bad, in fact my 2 youngest kids eat them readily, just not nearly as good as the Larabar.  I think the tartness of the cherries in the Larabar kick up the flavor vs the milder blueberry flavor of the PURE (maybe the lemon juice add as an attempt to kick up the PURE bar flavor and tartness?).  In fairness I should probably review the PURE Cherry Cashew bar but I much prefer almonds over cashews so don't plan on ordering any from Amazon.  If I stumble on the PURE cherry in a regular store I will give one a try thugh.  I still get both auto shipped from Amazon for variety sake, but am looking for a better tasting blueberry bar w/ basic ingredients including nuts.<br /><br />For grins here is a comparison of the Larabar, PURE, Snickers, Hershey's and Maruchan Chicken Ramen noodles in a few categories.  Stats are listed in the order I listed them in the previous sentence.<br /><br />Calories:  190, 190, 280, 210, 380<br />Total Fat:  8g, 9, 14, 13, 14  Saturated Fat:  0.5g, 1, 5, 8, 7<br />Sugars:  21g, 20, 30, 24, 0<br />Protein:  4g, 6, 4, 3, 10<br />Sodium:  0mg, 5, 140, 35, 1540 !!!

review/summary: Cashew Cookie is My Favorite Larabar!!!!!
review/text: Cashew Cookie is my very favorite variety of all the Larabars!!!<br /><br />The reason I love it so much, is because it reminds me of shortbread.  I always loved shortbread, but do not eat it anymore due to the butter and eggs.  I need to find a good vegan recipe for shortbread, if there are any, but this cashew cookie bar is perfect.<br /><br />With my shortbread cookies, I prefer tea.  Therefore, with my Larabar Cashew Cookies, I prefer tea.<br /><br />I love both coffee and tea, but with shortbread, I feel tea is what goes best.  There are certain things that just go together.  Such as cornbread and iced tea; flatbread pizza and bubbly fruit juice; cold weather and coffee; hot weather and watermelon; friends and cozy lunch diners; shortbread and tea.  And in this case, it is Larabar Cashew Cookie and Tea.<br /><br />These bars come in different awesome and amazing flavors.<br /><br />These bars are healthy.  They are vegan-friendly.  There are no bad ingredients, such as sugar, chemicals, or preservatives.  There isn't even flour.  There are only healthy ingredients in these bars: fruits and nuts.  The fruit sweetens them.  They fool you into thinking you're eating something bad, because they taste so good.

These are a great pick me up that is terrific to have handy when a meeting or function goes long, or to keep me out of the drive thru on the way home from the beach or a road trip. They are high in carbs, but I don't eat them all the time. They are simple, with few ingredients, and are minimally processed. I feel good after eating them, and it doesn't feel like I just swallowed a brick, or that I have to wash it down with two gallons of water. On long bike rides or races they are perfect for balancing nutritional intake. Triathletes take note!

review/text: These bars have a strong cherry taste, but because they have no sugar, they don't really taste like cherry pie. The bars have only three ingredients: dates, almonds, and unsweetened cherries. The almonds are chopped pretty finely, but still give the bar a bit of crunchiness. I love the taste, but if you're looking for something sweet, you might be disappointed. Each bar has 190 calories and 80 of them are from fat.

review/summary: Wholesome Goodness, Conveniently Packaged Into One Bar
review/text: After just one bite, I was completely sold on this bar - it is PACKED with pieces of pistachios and cashews, has a sweet (but definitely not overly sweet) flavor from the dates, and has a nice, chewy texture. Overall, a very pleasing experience for my taste buds - all while nourishing my body, as well!<br /><br />Do not let some of the nutritional information (i.e. the fat and sugar contents) scare you - pistachios are an excellent source of protein, Vitamin E, potassium, magnesium, iron, phosphorous, and zinc; the cashews contribute iron and zinc as well, plus heart-healthy oils and Vitamin B6. In addition, the dates are a good source of Vitamins A, C, and B-Complex, plus iron and and magnesium as well. Even though the bar is only 51 grams, it is VERY satisfying and filling.<br /><br />Everything in this bar occurs naturally - no chemicals, artificial ingredients, or trans-fats here! In fact, the bar contains just three ingredients: dates, pistachios, and cashews - no dictionary needed to figure out its contents, that's for sure.<br /><br />When I received my package of the Pistachio Larabars from Amazon, the box was in great condition, and none of the bars (at least, the ones I have eaten so far; and I eat one almost everyday) have been rancid. Overall, this product (and other Larabar flavors, as well) is HIGHLY recommended, on my part.

Not like the other "rock-in-my-stomach" bars that taste artificial.  I highly recommend ANY Larabar!!!

review/summary: Tasty, but why aren't these organic?
review/text: If you squish together dates & bananas, mix in finely chopped almonds, form into bars, and dry the bars a bit so they're not too sticky, you basically have a Banana Cookie LaraBar.  I think they taste quite good for packaged bars and are healthier than most of the available food bars.  They taste like, well, bananas, dates, and almonds, with the almonds providing a bit of crunch.<br /><br />Although the ingredient list is only three words long, the wrapper text extolling the healthfulness and near-magical virtues of the bar is seven lines long.  To partially quote, "Real food, raw food... No chemicals, no fillers, no medicinal tasting supplements.  LaraBar is never cooked.  Never Processed...[will] leave you with a pleasing sense of vitality and well being for hours to come."  And there's more information on the wrapper, "uncooked * unprocessed * no added sugar * non-GMO * gluten free * dairy free * soy free * vegan * kosher."  The LaraBar website also tells you (in case you haven't figured this out) non-irradiated, no sulfites, and no colorings.<br /><br />All this is well and good, but if they're going to the trouble of making a bar that's so fabulously healthy for you, then it would be nice if they used organic ingredients.  Eating a bar made with conventionally grown (pesticided) fruit invalidates some of the healthfulness of the bar.  The bar tastes good, but in terms of healthfulness, I think LaraBar can do better.<br /><br />P.S. And what's with the two dots above the first letter A in Lara?  Do they want us to think it's an exotically Scandinavian product?  Like Haagen Daz, Lara bars are made in the U.S.A.

review/summary: Amazon larabars taste stale and dry!
review/text: I've gotten this flavor larabar from the grocery store and loved it. In fact, that was the reason why I purchased it from Amazon - because the cost per unit is so much lower. The peanut butter cookie bar from the grocery store was moist and delicious. The bars I received from Amazon taste stale. They're dry and crumbly. The expiration date is not until 2013 so I don't understand why they would be this way but they are. I won't be reordering any more Larabars from Amazon!

review/summary: OK taste but surprise on last pack of white fuzzy
review/text: I figured I would give Larabar a try since I want to cut down my chips/cookie snacking on those late afternoon. I also shared them with my family and friends which got me varying opinions.  There was only one person that complained it was too sweet. Other health conscious, ingredient readers were impressed with the make and taste.  For myself, I thought they were OK. I don't normally snack on fruit bars like this so it took a bit to get accustomed to the sticky and "oily" fruit bar.<br /><br />As I was coming to the last couple bars in my Key Lime Pie, I ventured to get the Coconut Pie. Oddly, they almost tasted the same except for a slightly stronger coconut taste. It still had the "core" of dates and nuts,etc.  What really jumped at me is on my 2nd to last Key Lime Pie ... I noticed fuzzy edge on the bar.  The box stated it hasn't expired either so I am hoping this is a single bad bar in the box.  However it doesn't help that to search the term on the comments here that someone had a whole box of *bad*.  I'll see how the coconut pie fares but the mental image is now stuck on me. It is an OK alternative but I may seek another late afternoon snack.

review/text: Good for cooking sauces/etc. Not good for eating straight from the can or cooking items where you want the tomato to hold up.<br /><br />I like to put these into a salad sometimes, and they are too mushy to do so. I also make a tomato ragu to put over polenta where I like them to hold shape and they do not work for that either.<br /><br />Contadina brand is great for using when you don't want to cook them down to a sauce. These are good for heavy cooking.

review/summary: Great for iced tea!
review/text: Over the years I have tried making iced tea out of dozens of different herbal teas and most just end up tasting like lightly-flavored water.  This Yogi Sweet Thai Delight tea is the first I've tried that I will make again.  As a matter of fact, I intend to have a jug of it in the refrigerator all summer!  The taste is amazingly sweet (but not in a sugary way) and a little nutty (actually "coconut-ty.")  I don't use sweeteners or milk in my tea as a rule, but even if I did I wouldn't want to add sugar to this tea, it's perfectly sweet as it is.<br /><br />Since there's no recipe for iced tea on the box, I just winged it and put 8 tea bags into a gallon of boiling water, then turned it down and let it steep covered for about twenty minutes.  You could probably also make it the way my Mom made tea in the summer, by putting the bags in a gallon jar, adding room temperature water, sealing it and setting it in the sunniest place in the yard for the day.<br /><br />However you make it, you really should try this tea iced.  I'm not a huge tea drinker normally, but I'm completely hooked on this one.

review/summary: THE BEST CHAI GREEN I HAVE TASTED
review/text: I first had the opportunity of having this tea about 13 years ago.  The blend used for this tea is very smooth.  I have tried several other chai green tea brands, but none can compare to Yogi Tea.  I have allowed several friends, and co-workers to sample this tea, and all are hooked on it.  I have also tried the redbush chai, and black chai teas from Yogi Tea, all were very good but the taste of the chai green is superb by far.  Follow the directions, allowing the tea to steep, to get the full effect, you won't be disappointed.  I usually use white sugar only as a sweentener, but have also used Equal sweetener.  Thank you Yogi Tea for a wonderful tea.

review/summary: This tea is a mixture of different spices
review/text: Although this tea is flavorful and tastes fine, I should have read the description more carefully. I was looking for pure licorice root tea. This tea has other spices added to it and the orange peel flavor is dominant and licorice flavor is muted. I am giving it three stars because the name of the tea should include some of the other spices. Read the ingredients listed before you purchase. Here is the description, "Combined with a touch of cinnamon, orange peel and other carefully selected herbs and spices" If you like these other spices then you will be happy. Otherwise, you might opt for a pure licorice tea and the box will say, "Ingredients: Licorice Root". That was what I really wanted, although this tea tastes perfectly good.

The licorice flavor doesn't intensify with longer steeping time so if you want tht flavor to be more intense you have to use two bags.  My husband hates this tea though, he is Japanese and it reminds him of the herbal tonics they made him drink as a kid! More for me...!<br />I also like the Yogi Throat Cure tea, similar flavor but has cherry bark.

review/text: I'm addicted to Yogi Teas and have vowed to try them all.  This Indian Spice tea is delicious. I've found that many of the Yogi teas are not as strong as I want them to be, so the tea bag stays in until I've drank all the tea. Not so with this tea, this tea has a VERY strong Cinnamon taste, which I find enjoyable. In truth, I may have left the bag in too long today, as the cinnamon flavor is burning a little.<br />The directions on the box say to add milk (or milk substitute) and sweetener to the tea. They mean it. I tried to drink it plain, but couldn't, it just didn't taste right. However, I did add a popular flavored coffee creamer, and that worked beautifully.  This is a whole new drink now, doesn't feel like tea, it feels like a treat. Enjoy.

This is the first 6week kit of any kind I have done. It is in the secondary aging at the present time but, when I transfered it and tasted it I was suprised at how well it tasted and the amount of body it had. I will do a update once I bottle it but, at the present time I am considering purchasing the Amarone version of this kit. Update on 07/09/2010. this wine has been in the bottle for a while now and is 6 months old from the day I pitched the yeast. Opened an bottle and was very suprised at how good it tasted compared to 3 months. I will let it age for 6 more months now. This is a kit I would do again.<br />Novemeber 13, 2010 update. This wine has aged quite well. I opened another bottle and am impressed with the wine. Doesn't have any kit taste like I get from some of the other brands of kits. This is my 12 wine kit and one of the best so far. I will buy this one again and let it age for a year before consuming any.

I think this may have been a sanitation issue on my part.  Had the wine not turned sour, I think it would have been pretty good (from a pre-fermentation taste).  I may try this one again in the future.  One thing that I did like about this kit was that it included labels and heat shrink / foil wrappers for the tops of the bottles.

review/summary: Argentinian Malbac
review/text: I just bottled this wine. It stated it was a full 6 gallons. In order to get 6 gallons, I needed to top off with better than a gallon of water. I thought that would dilute the wine too much, so I racked it into a 5 gallon carboy and proceeded from there. I did add oak chips during the fermenting process.<br /><br />The end result, this wine is great. When I asked my wife what she thought, she said this is going to be really big. I'll cellar it, but I don't think it will last long. I'd defintely do another one of these.<br /><br />Since I didn't get the full six gallons - therefore 4 stars.

review/text: I love trying out different spices and salts. This salt claims to have a sort of clay taste afterwards and it really does. The price was right and the size of the bag was good also. I sometimes just take a pinch and enjoy it.

review/summary: First Time Using...and Love It!!!
review/text: OMG wow! This stuff is awesome. The flavor is incredible, and it allows for great color contrast in certain dishes (e.g. I sprinkle it on some hummus for color + flavor). It works awesome for fish and veggies. The flavor is phenomenal, and the amount you need for that salty taste is perfect. We ordered several different salts (pink, gray, black, etc.)....but this one is, by far, our favorite over all. It tastes so clean!!!<br /><br />You want good flavor without the unhealthy punch of regular salt? This is your answer. Very versatile and welcome.

review/summary: Kalua Pork? Yes Please!
review/text: This feedback concerns Black Hawaiian Sea Salt and Hawaiian Red 'Alaea Sea Salt from the Spice Lab. We had come across a recipe for slow cooker Kalua Pork on a Wednesday and it recommended using these two kinds of salt. (My wife has a food porn problem and Pinterest is not helping.) We ordered the salt that afternoon with free Amazon Prime shipping and received them on Friday. We prepared the pork and started cooking it that night and by Saturday night we were in Kalua Pork heaven! Here's the recipe we found: [....] (I don't know why Fuji Mama is the whitest person I've ever seen?!)

review/summary: Black lava and Red Alaea - both great!
review/text: These are both very nice salts.  As promised, I can taste a hint of charcoal in the black lava and a hint of clay in the red.  I certainly don't consider myself to have a refined palate, but there is no mistaking the flavours. A little goes a long way - another reason this salt is well worth the extra expense.  I guess I'll have to try the bamboo next.

review/summary: Quite hard crystals not as good as others
review/text: I got this and "Course Gray Sea Salt" from Brittany both from Amazon. The crystals in this salt tend to be very hard and hence are more like little stones than anything else and also do not impart as much flavor as you eat them added to your meal.<br /><br />I have not tried grinding them up. The other salt was not as hard crystals and added a lot of good flavor to the meals I added it to (sprinkling a little on top).<br /><br />I will not get this again. I will get the other again.<br /><br />It will last you forever unless you are a salt junky looking for high blood pressure, as this amount of salt is a HUGE amount of salt in you want to stay healthy. Just a tiny bit with each meal is plenty, and that is the problem here! The tiny bit doesn't impart much flavor or texture. The Brittany did.

review/summary: Takes me back to Nauni's kitchen
review/text: I remember the aroma of sweet italian sausage in my grandmother's kitchen.  I can see her hands place the platter of sausage, peppers and onions on the table.  Then came the bowl of homemade  tomato gravy and fresh loaves of crusty italian bread.  When I bit into that sausage it was tender, juicy and spiced with fennel and anise.  For years I have searched for an italian sausage that would come close to the aroma and taste I remembered.  I've ordered it everywhere and some were good, some bad, but none matched.  When I put the rope of Esposito's sweet sausage in the pan and the kitchen filled with that  aroma I was suddenly a kid again in my grandmother's kitchen.  It was delicious on bread, with brocolli rabe, garlic, olive oil and crushed red pepper and pasta.  I will definitely order from Esposito's again.

I have to go on his review as I have not tried it myself.  But my brother vouched for it also.

review/summary: Yummy and nutritious!
review/text: I have a maltese dog who's 6 years old. He's been eating this since he was 2, and he absolutely loves this food. It smells great, it's nutritious (as far as I can tell), and it's dry dog food, so it's better for my dog's teeth. The only small issue is that it tends to be greasy. I guess the oil is good for your dog's skin and hair, but it does make my dog's hair around his mouth quite greasy and difficult to clean.
