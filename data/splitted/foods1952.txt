review/summary: Wonderful Holiday Beverage (Especially for Pumpkin Fans)
review/text: Okay, first off, full disclosure:  I am a pumpkin fanatic. I love the taste of pumpkin when the holidays roll around, from pumpkin cookies, to pumpkin pie, pumpkin soup, and (yes) even pumpkin ale.<br /><br />So I might be a little biased.<br /><br />However, I have to say that I really loved the Maxwell House International Pumpkin Spice Latte.  It mixes up with a slightly frothy, slightly creamy consistency when drunk hot, and the flavors are rich and pumpkin-y, with some nice accents of cloves and cinnamon and other appropriate notes.<br /><br />I also mixed it up as an iced latte, by mixing a little very hot water from the tap with a few spoonfuls of the coffee, mixing thoroughly and vigorously til dissolved, and then adding milk and giving one last stir.  I then added ice, and it was just as delicious iced as it is hot.<br /><br />Pumpkin Spice Latte is ultimately really yummy, and the perfect holiday treat for a cold day. It's basically like a cup full of hot pumpkin pie in coffee form.  Which is a good thing for us pumpkin fans -- so if you're one of them, you'll probably really enjoy this coffee.  I loved it so much I was sorely tempted to buy the case of six, since I know it's limited to the holidays.<br /><br />Cheers and happy holidays!

review/summary: Great, but too sweet
review/text: I absolutely love coffee!  And instant saves a ton of trouble and angst.  So, as opposed to other coffee afficianados, I'm not a snob who has a disdain for instant coffee.  In fact, I like it.  The trouble here is that the instant coffee is way too sweet.  Nearly four servings of sugar in the entire miniscule serving.  So, you get your joe, but you also get a helping of way too much sugar.

review/summary: Needs more flavor!!
review/text: I've had pumpkin spice latte's from Starbucks, and I buy pumpkin flavored coffee and creamer, so I really thought I would like this. It does make a nice foam layer on the top, and it is ok flavored, but just ok. I would've liked it to be sweeter and have a little more flavor. I made it with the 4tsp's as stated on the box, but I had to add more because, I thought it was too watery tasting. I tried adding more of the mix and I even tried adding sugar, but every time it just comes up bland.

review/summary: Tasty, needs alterations in preparation
review/text: A little weak if made as directed, I always found myself adding just under double the recommended amount. Definitely tastier made with milk- makes it a rich drink more akin to a coffee house latte than something instant prepared at home. I have enjoyed the Maxwell House instant French Vanilla flavor, and I will most likely purchase this one again as well.

review/text: I ordered a case of these pretzels and they came in a timely manner.  I ordered peanut butter cheese crackers which came at the same time.  They were not damaged in any way BUT the the coating on the pretzels had melted during the trip and each individual 100 calorie pack was fused together in one big mess.  They tasted fine though and my grandkids didn;t seem to mind the fusion which had taken place. I would recommend them if you buy them in the winter.

review/text: Years ago I had a wonderful Italian meal in Boston. I was told at the time that the distinct flavor was due to the Locatelli cheese. I carried a piece of paper with the name for many years but could never find in Calif. or on the internet. Imagine my surprise when I ran into and purchased said cheese from Amazon. The supplier who sent it, did a great job of packing and was prompt in delivery. It is a very nice cheese.

review/text: this is a great product!!! i LOVE mojitos, but they are hard to come by since fresh mint isnt a usual item to stock at bars, homes, etc.  bottled mixes will do, but i cant help but notice they dont taste homemade.  so, sadly, i go without.<br /><br />i just had my first (large) glass of this mojito slushy and couldnt be happier with the flavor!  the blend is perfect: tart, sweet, and minty.  the slushy consistency helps give it an effervescent quality.<br /><br />making it is the simplest thing.  'add rum to this line.  add optional flavored liquor to this line.  add warm water, shake, then finish adding more water to this line.  freeze 6 hours.'  i actually made it two days ago, but after letting it thaw while i was taking a bath, it was a happy, happy pick me up.<br /><br />i plan to always keep some of the bags in stock at my place, which i may or may not share with visitors. .. . this is something i can indulge in and not feel the least bit selfish!!!! (if theyve never had something, they dont know what they are missing, right?!)

review/summary: Drank up the WHOLE bag yesterday with hubby!
review/text: I'm not a big fan of mojitos because I don't like the leaves floating in my drink. However, this was delicious! There was mint in the drink. However it was chopped into tiny pieces. My husband ran across this at Sam's Club as part of some promotion/road show. (3 for $20). We tried the Mojito mix yesterday which was so good. Hubby even added a bit of strawberry daiquiri mix to create strawberry mojitos. At an outdoor concert yesterday, this was the perfect cool treat and very portable. I was surprised by the taste. Very happy overall with the quality of the product. HOwever unsure if I would pay $20+ for 1 bag. May have to run back to Sam's to see if they are still offering the promotion to get a few more. Very tasty!!

review/summary: Convenient, great tasting, effective and adaptable - A winner!
review/text: Although I spent two decades in the bar business, I retired to other work before the "Mojito" became trendy . . .and to this day, I have never had a "Mohito" prepared like they do on TV.  I tend more toward a simpler form of imbibing . . .red wine or a good Irish Whiskey on the rocks.  This all began to unravel a few months ago when my ex-fiance and I went to a friend/relatives Christening.  The ceremony took place in a spectacular Greek Orthodox cathedral.  It was at the reception a little later that I the child's grandfather brought out his home made Grappa . . .<br /><br />I found that drinking Grappa straight is a character building experience . . .somewhat like Tequilla shots-but with smoother and more tasteful aspect.  I began shopping for Grappa noticed that Grappa was readily available.  I began trying different brands with pleasing results.  The ex-fiance had less success.  She bought a bottle that tasted a little "off" . . .and I suggested we might try mixing it with something to make it more palatable.  Mojitos came to mind . . .and Amazon provided me with the opportunity to try Lt. Blender's Mojito in a Bag. The experiment was a success . . .no Grappa was lost or wasted, and the ex and I may have invented the "Grappajito".<br /><br />The "in a bag" concept was new, and more than a little strange to me.  My years in the bar business had made me wary of all the "convenience cocktails/mixes" . . .and I had always made a point to make my mixes (Bloody Mary, Margarita, etc) from scratch batch recipes.  I was skeptical, but had no previous taste experience to bias me . . .and the "bag" worked wonderfully on all levels.  The mixing was relatively easy and provided several options to the conventional "slushy" bag Mojito.  Since we were already well past the constraints of conventionality with our Grappa, we opted to mix and serve on the rocks rather than wait for the freezer.  It tasted great and did wonders for the "off" Grappa.  I plan to use the rest of the "bags" during a trip with friends to a concert in Southern California next week . . .and I am hoping that the "Grappajito" takes off from there.  I cannot speak for the rest of the Lt. Blender's line, but the "Mojito in a Bag" is a winner!

review/summary: Great Deal
review/text: I bought this on sale and it was a fantastic deal. I've been trying to work more flax seed into our diet, mostly it's been the brown flax seed. I liked this because it doesn't make the food darker looking. Usually the brown seeds are cheaper, but with the sale these seeds were a bargain. I understand there isn't a difference with the health benefits. We bought a cheap coffee grinder and will grind seeds to then add to oatmeal, bread products, and even cookies. When I make pancakes with Bisquick I toss in a little ground flax. Really, if it has flour in it we add ground flax. I know some people leave the seeds whole, but I read that your body gets more nutrients from the seed when they're ground, and freshly ground is the best.

review/summary: What happened to Chia seeds?
review/text: I started using flax seeds for all it's benefits already listed here in the reviews.  I'm on the borderline of hypertension, and the flax seeds had helped me get my blood pressure down!  What a great price too.  Later on I learned of the benefits of Chia seeds.  Chia basically beats the flax seed in pretty much all categories, so I ordered myself a 5lb bag of chia for $30.  I wasn't sure what 5lbs was going to look like in chia seeds, but it was HUGE.  I was really excited to start using the chia seeds, but I was still stuck with so many jars of these flax seeds.  I gave some away and finished what I had left over.<br />  Let me say that chia seeds are awesome.  They are supposedly superior to flax seeds in every way, and I find them easier to clean out of my dishes than ground flax.<br />  So here I am on Amazon looking for more chia seeds when to my surprise the prices for chia shoot out of the roof!!!!  My same 5lb bag that I bought in February 2012 for $30, are now (September 2012) $120!!!!!!  All types of packages in all weights, the prices have gone way up.  I also notice that many sellers are "out of stock".  What a bust.....<br />  So now i'm going back to flax seeds.  Flax seeds are what begun my health changes and I truly believe that they are just as good as chia.  However given the choice I would definitely buy the chia.  Just not at those insane prices..... I will be checking every couple of weeks to see what happens with the price of chia.<br /><br />Flax seed vs. Chia seed.  My unprofessional comparison<br /><br />Flax pros<br />-  extremely healthy<br />-  extremely affordable<br />cons<br />-  whole seeds NEED to be ground for full benefits<br />-  i found the ground flax needs just a little scrubbing to be cleaned off dishes<br /><br />Chia pros<br />-  supposedly superior to flax seeds in all categories<br />-  don't need to be gound<br />-  cleans up is easy, just rinse<br />cons<br />-  went from extremely affordable to extremely expensive!! (compared to flax)<br /><br />In conclusion Flax and Chia seeds are both amazing.  Seed vs. seed though I would choose Chia.

review/summary: A plum of a deal
review/text: Otherwise known as prunes, dried plums are one of the very  best foods there are, for anti-oxidant value.  These are very tasty, and you don't have to worry about any undesirable or even unintentioned bad things being in there.  Even my wife, who is a junk food junkie if there ever was one, likes them!  Having 6 oz.re-sealable bags mean they stay fresh (vs. using 16 Oz. box).  There is no down side here.  Even as a very severe diabetic, I have no problem with them.

review/text: This is the first time I've tried these organic plums and they are the perfect healthy snack to keep by my computer at work. They're moist and flavorful, and we don't have to worry about chemicals or sulfur because they're organic. My 6 year old daughter loves them too and I'm happy to see her getting more fiber in her diet. We like to cut them into pieces and top salads and cereals with them or eat them alone. I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Great prunes... I mean plums!
review/text: Purchased Made in Nature prunes and really like them.  They are not messy, sticky, and oily like Newman's Own.  They do take more chewing as they are drier, but that can be solved by soaking for a few minutes to re-hydrate them a bit. Overall, they are my new favorite, although slightly higher priced than other brands.

review/summary: Tasty in oatmeal
review/text: I have only tried one bag of these organic prunes.<br /><br />They taste best to me in home-cooked oatmeal. I add a couple to the pot before or during the 5-minute simmer. Boiling brings out the flavor and softens them up.<br /><br />Because they are dry to the touch, they don't make my fingers sticky like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET5Y52">Newman's Own Organics California Prunes, Pitted, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>. But they cost more per ounce than Newman's and their flavor when dry is not nearly as intense.

review/summary: gone bad
review/text: I'd never buy these again.  We purchased these Nov 22nd, 2011 and the date on the bags say Best Before Oct 18, 2012.  For the past several months whenever I open a new bag, half the contents have gone bad.  They are covered with what looks like fungus or something and we end up throwing it all out(not knowing what it is).  It's too bad  because early Okay bags tasted fine.  Perhaps it's because they are unsulfured, I don't know.  They have been stored just like other dried fruits we buy, in a Pantry.  Either the Best By date is wrong or something is wrong with the processing of the dried plums.

review/summary: Good solution for irregularity but
review/text: I ordered these prunes as well as some from Newman's Own to use when I travel.  I like prunes as they keep me regular and they do not make me gassy like some other fiber products.  While these are good, I prefer the ones from Newman's Own.  These are drier and not as tasty.  I find that I like these particular prunes better if I heat them with water and add a little orange juice.  But then they are not suitable for travel.  Newman's Own are moist and travel well as they are in a resealable pack.<br />I note another review had the opposite opinion so your best bet is to try both and make a choice.

review/text: At the same time the name "prune" turned into the name "dried plum" the product got soft and gooey instead of firm and chewy.  The texture of the changed product is more like spoiled fruit.<br /><br />I have been searching for something that more closely resembles the prunes I used to love.  These come the closest so far.  They are still a little softer and more moist than the prunes of yore, but at least I don't find them disgusting.

I did not dare try them because I know they are not supposed to look like that; they are supposed to be clean and shiny. I cannot return them now because I am overseas. $24 down the drain. Next time I will get them from Wal-Mart, at least there I can return them immediately.

Grape is good and so is the apple.<br />I see the price per ounce, while buying it from a store and it is comparable to the other 100% juice brands. However, this comes with a pouch so I have no dish to wash.<br />I drink this all the time at my job and it is convenient for wherever I go.<br /><br />The taste is really good and the ingredients are perfect!<br /><br />I don't buy the Spenda(Chem Processed sugar) or high fructose corn syrup. I try to buy it natural or in sugar form, just try to keep it little though.

review/summary: WAY Too Salty
review/text: I use to work in a restaurant and we made stuff like this all the time. It's not rocket science and it was only because I am lazy that I bought them. I have orders these products two times the last time over 2 years ago, thinking the first time it was pretty good, not as good as fresh at the restaurant but good in a pinch. But this last batch is really salty. I checked and the old bottle has salt listed as last on three of the spices batches and none at all on the 4th, this bottle has salt listed as the first ingredient on all but one. And the FDA has ingredients listed in order of amount, so there is WAY TOO MUCH SALT in all but three of the spice mixes. We only added a pinch of salt at the restaurant and making it at home I do the same. I will not be buying this product again, instead I will just make huge batches in advance and then use them until I need to do it again.

review/summary: good *and* cheap!
review/text: It's not very often that the words good and cheap go well together but for me these Nutty bars are an exception. The coating is a thin "chocolate-y" flavor, meaning no one is going to accuse this confection of being *enrobed* in high dollar chocolate BUT it does taste like a reasonable facsimile of decent milk chocolate. The wafer layers taste like those old fashioned large waffle cookies, the kind with the peanut butter filling in them. The peanut-y filling part tastes more like a Nutter Butter type flavor (sweet, creamy) rather than a Peanut Butter cup flavor (heavier roasted peanut). The flavors are really well balanced so no one element of the bar takes over the other.<br /><br />Generous packaging with two sticks per cellophane package - to be honest I don't know if a two-pack constitutes a "serving" since I always eat both sticks anyway.<br /><br />I can always find these at local big box and grocery stores so it's good to compare prices on these; if having these shipped, watch temps in summer - these melt *really* easily*. A good excuse to freeze them though - they are great that way too!<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and happy to recommend.

If you're a big chocolate lover, 34% does not taste very chocolatey, and the consistency coupled with the taste is sort of gross.<br /><br />I would suggest at least 45% cocoa. Up to 55% is great, too. After that you'll get the more bitter dark chocolate flavor, which I also find delicious in it's own way.

These figs can be great -- and they can be horribly infested.  if you eat calmyrnas you know you have to check each one for wasps -- i expect that.  But I also found little beetle-like bugs that i have never before found in figs, as well as a lot of simple bad-tasting figs.  Amazon does not accept grocery returns, but made in nature promises 100% satisfaction.  Well, i am 0% satisfied after several phone calls and emails i never reached a human, never got return instructions or authorization, and i am still out almost $200 for several cases (we eat a lot of figs!) of inedible, bug-laden figs.

review/text: These are the best dried figs I have ever tasted. I also bought the black mission figs for comparison. These figs are larger and tastier than the black variety, yet have a chewier exterior. I personally find these to be worth the extra expense over the other variety, yet find both to be excellent organic dried fruits. Perfect, as nature intended.

review/summary: Soft and Easy-to-Eat
review/text: These figs are soft in texture and easy for children to chew, however, I was disappointed in the lack of flavor.  I love the Old World figs strung on a piece of vine; they assume the firmness and consistency of leather, but Ohhhh, the flavor!  They taste like sunshine and sweet, old trees on a sunny hillside: these taste like nothing at all. . . just stuff with tiny seeds.  They have no scent.  They are not sweet.  I take your word that they are figs, but they sure don't taste like the ones I've known.

review/summary: YUMMM!!!!!
review/text: These are GREAT!!!!  Very high quality.  Totally delicious.  I also ordered the black mission figs, but they are not at all worth re-ordering.  These golden ones on the other hand - I don't want to ever be without.  Yumm!!!!<br /><br />One other note though...  at this price you're paying $5.23 per back.  Each bag has about 11 figs in it.  That's 47� per fig.  $12 a pound.  They're very good - but that's pretty expensive....<br /><br />Next I'm going to try these (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TZME0E">Dried Calimyrna Figs - 5 lb</a>)  at $4.30 a pound.  I'll write back later....

review/summary: buy direct from made in nature
review/text: The first time I bought dried figs was from Made in Nature direct.  They were quite pricey but very DELICIOUS!!!  I emailed the company and asked why.  I was told when you buy from them they are much fresher.  The second time I ordered 2 bags from Amazon, well let me tell you, there was no comparison, the figs were dried out when I opened them.  I always keep them in the fridge, the longer I had them the worse they got!!!!  I was tempted to return the 2nd bag but tossed them instead.  I'll never buy food from Amazon again.

review/summary: Try their pineapple instead.
review/text: It's hard to find decent dried figs these days. If you're hard up for some, these are OK. They are dried, so they are tough and chewy. But some in each package appear to have leaked open so the moisture from inside the fig has soaked into the skin and turned it into something akin to tire rubber.<br /><br />I have tried their organic, unsulfured dried pineapple and it is excellent; read my review on that product page.

review/summary: Addictive treat
review/text: I love these figs. My grandfather had a couple of fig trees in his backyard when I was growing up. These bring back memories. I could eat TONS of these dried figs, but they are high in fiber so I can't or I will suffer gastronomical consequences. I must limit myself to 3-4 a day. My seven year old son loves these as well. It is one way I can get fruit into him. Costco sells these in a 40 ounce bag which I frequently get. They are a lot cheaper there. I don't remember how much I pay, but it is around $10 or $15 for the bag. These are almost $27 for 42 ounces. This is one of those rare instances where it is cheaper to go to a brick and mortar store than buy on Amazon.

review/text: We were inspired to make Figgy Pudding after Christmas caroling with our Church.  The song, "We wish you a Merry Christmas" has two verses that talk about Figgy Pudding - so off to a search engine, and what do you know we had to order figs - none found in the local stores.  The figs were great, packed very nicely.  The only drawback was the whitish patches on the figs.  We did some research and found that this is VERY normal.  I would order again and again.

They made a great base for the chocolate coating and there weren't many broken in the box I got.

review/summary: Very happy!
review/text: We live in a rural area, where we are unable to buy the only dog food (Evo Herring and Salmon) my allergic-to-everything-in-most-dry-dog-foods-dogs can eat. We had been ordering their food through another wholesale supplier, but despite being on auto-ship, did not receive their last two food orders b/c they were out of stock. Panicked, I turned to Amazon, and ordered from J-B Wholesale Pet Supplies Inc. Not only was the price much cheaper than what I had been paying for their food (by $20), they got it to my door within four days (and I had been thinking that since it was ground shipping, I wouldn't see it until late next week, meaning my dogs would have been eating rice and potatoes, respectively). Thank you so much, J-B Wholesalers :)<br /><br />Per the product itself: This particular formula of Evo has been working out very well for my dogs, and we have tried ALL of the grain free dog food on the market over the past four years. My dogs have serious allergies to almost everything, and different things, too, which means it's hard to find a food both can eat. I appreciate that this formula uses peas as the carbohydrate source, since one of my dogs is allergic to rice and the other to potatoes; I also appreciate that this formula has neither flaxseed oil nor chicken fat, as both dogs are allergic to flaxseed, and one dog was getting pre-bloat symptoms from other allergy formulas that contain chicken fat, despite restricting activity for hours before and after eating and slowing down his intake :-) He hasn't had any symptoms since we switched to Evo, and both dogs LOVE this food. Granted, Labs will eat any food, but this one seems to be their favorite.

review/summary: A food that works for all of my dogs!
review/text: Between my three small pooches, I've been on a constant quest to satisfy the following criteria:<br /><br />-Cat food-sized kibble for my boy who inhales all food<br />-Formula my picky girls will actually eat (instead of hiding behind their bowls for above-mentioned inhaler of food)<br />-Recipe that includes little to no red meat (they love it, but more than a little makes them constipated)<br />-Recipe that is also 100% grain-free, including rye, barley, oat, rice, etc. (my male dog developed a severe skin allergy) and poultry-free (same reason)<br /><br />I started with the red meat formula simply because the fish was sold out at my local dog food store, which they absolutely loved, and was concerned they wouldn't want to go to fish from red meat (which they prefer), but all three of my dogs absolutely love this!  Before our food issues became a problem, I was rotating between other organic and holistic foods, including Castor and Pollux, Blue Buffalo, Taste of the Wild and Orijen, which probably made the transition to this food easy (although I always gradually change foods over several days), and my dogs, after several months, have also not had any change for the worse in coat condition or overall health.  It's also worth mentioning that my dogs have toned up a bit since switching to EVO, with the same exercise routine and the same eating schedule (one raw meal a day, two dry).  So, for those of you with problem eaters like mine, I hope this review helps!

review/text: There have been many reviews and unsubstantiated rumors where customers are afraid that P&G is going to change the formula for EVO.  I have looked on the packaging and have not noticed a change.  I also have not noticed any change with my dog.  I wanted to make sure my American Staffy got some Omega 3's for her skin.  Let me tell you that prior to feeding her EVO, she would break out underneath her belly with red rashes from allergies.  She would also have alot of dander eminate from her black coat of fur.<br />She has had neither in the past year I started feeding her EVO.  This product has been nothing short of amazing.  She is pretty good in going to the bathroom regularly and it has not changed.  She handles the protein pretty well.  I highly recommend this dog to anyone who wants a very good dog food.
