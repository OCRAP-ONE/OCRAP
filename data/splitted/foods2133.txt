review/summary: Very good overall
review/text: I bought this item with a gift certificate.  I used the cheese in a cheese tasting party with good friends.  The cheese arrived quickly and in good shape.  There was a substitution in my order which was fine since there was a disclaimer about substitutions if the exact cheese wasn't available.  My only complaint was that there was no information about the cheese.  For my tasting, I had to do all the leg work to get information so I could tell my guests what they were eating.  Thank goodness for the internet!  Nevertheless, I would buy this again.  This was the perfect combination, I believe, for the cheese novices I had at the party, nothing too strong or stinky.  Each had a distinct flavor and it was enjoyable to get everyone's reaction on the different cheeses.

review/summary: Wonderful and different - We loved it.
review/text: This is one of the nicest samplers I have ever received.  Each variety was excellent. I served it at a party and received rave reviews. The quality of the cheese was excellent, well packed, and for the price, worth every penny.  Like another reviewer here though, I would have appreciated it if the cheese had been accompanied by an explanation just what it was, what area it was made in and that sort of information.  I am certainly not an expert on cheese from this country and was rather clueless as to what I was eating.  Other than that it was great and I am not going to mark down the rating simply because of my own ignorance of the subject as there it is all taste matters.<br /><br />I plan to order several of these samplers for friends this year.

review/text: These pork chomps mini knotz are of very good value. For the 21 count, I purchased it for $10. Other products with similar size and weight was in the $20 range.<br /><br />Our Labrador pup likes these bones and definitely keeps her occupied. Give it as a treat or hide it, either way it keeps them busy.<br /><br />The knotz are about 2 - 3 inches in length and about half an inch wide. The size varies, but that's the rough size of the bones.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with the product. If my dog could, she would say so too.

review/text: This is the closest thing to European beer snacks in the US! I used to buy Gardetto's Mix just because of those rye bread chips! Finally, they make 'em separately now. Thank you! Contains MSG though, which I'm not really fond of. Try 'em with milk too! You may like it. Quite addictive, be aware! Once you opened a bag - you just can't stop. Be careful if you have very sensitive gums. Publix got 'em in smaller packages. But Amazon has the best price if you buy 'em in bulk. Highly recommend!

I looked no further and decided to type Rye chips on Amazon and wah-la!, it popped up! I quickly bought it and I would say it's decent priced for a 12-pack for $30. I do wish it was cheaper but this is hard to find, so it makes up for it. Great salty snack and would buy again. If you haven't tried it, give it a go! It's a very crunchy snack so you'll find yourself chewing a lot. Exercise for the mouth!

review/summary: PURE Gardetto's Roasted Garlic Rye Chips!
review/text: I used to eat all the garlic chips out of a bowl of Gardetto's Snack Mix, which pissed everyone off. Then one day at one of Love's Tuck Stops, I found these Gardetto's Roasted Rye Chips hanging on the rack with all the other chips, and bought a bunch. Knowing they exist, I started looking everywhere else, but never did find them in any of the stores I happened to be in. The closest Love's Truck Stop was 75 miles away, so the last time I bought a few bags, I scanned them with my iPod, and found that Amazon sells them. Plus, Amazon also has them in 8 oz bags at a lower price than the 4.75 oz bags from Love's with free shipping on a case of 12 ($29.52 = $2.46 per bag, where Love's was around $2.59, or $2.69 per bag). I see this as a win-win situation, except my wife has discovered my cache, since 12 bags are a little hard to keep secret. It's a good deal, is what I'm passing along.

review/summary: So good, yet so bad
review/text: I've given these Gardetto's Roasted Garlic Rye Chips 5 stars based on their taste, but after reviewing the ingredients list the 5-star rating should be taken with a grain of salt. I just bought a bag of these from the grocery store after seeing them for the first time and I was so excited because they are my favorite part of the Gardetto's mix but it never has enough of them. Now I know why. I never realized just how bad they are for you, for just 1/2 cup you get 10 grams of fat, 3grams of that being Trans fat (the bad stuff), and while others have pointed out that it also contains MSG (Monosodium glutamate) studies have shown that it is perfectly safe [...] I'm more concerned about the high trans fat content and the overall high fat content, as well as the extremely high sodium content (320mg per serving). So while these rye chips are delicious, they aren't exactly the healthiest snack, far from it in fact. I'm not really sure why they are so high in fat, I mean you'd think baked rye bread chips wouldn't be so bad for you, but these really are terrible as far as health is concerned. It just isn't worth it for me because I already need to drop about 30lbs and these will not help matters, so I need to find a healthier snack. Having said that, they are REALLY tasty. I guess you just need to decide whether they're worth it, but if you do decide to buy them then please be sure to enjoy in moderation, your arteries will thank you.

They also contain MSG, BHT, caramel color, and some other questionable ingredients.<br />The taste may be 4 or 5 stars, but the nutrition is negative 10!  At least they are honest with their labeling.  Most companies would reduce the serving size so that it came to less than 1/2g of trans fat per serving and slap a "trans-fat free*" label on the front to deceive the consumer.<br />I stumbled upon these while searching for organic ingredients to make my own "healthy" snack mix.  These used to be one of my favorite parts of the mix...so disappointed!!!

I love that this is 2 bottles which I use the oil about twice a week, and you really only need a few drops, so this should last me through the year, if you use it less, this will last a while, and will stay if kept sealed. This is a wonderful deal on a wonderful product. DO not let the smell get you, it is to die for once it hits your taste buds. If you have thought about it I would suggest that you find a local place where they offer tastings and try it because it is a tad much money to buy it and not like it. this compares to the $20+ an ounce oils and even beats some in taste and value!!

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I had truffle oil in a califlower soup, and also once in an omelet, both at restaurants,  -- and it tasted AMAZING -- so I was wanting to try it out in my own food.  I decided on the black truffle oil even though reviewers say it's "stronger" than the white.  So it's okay, I like it well enough.  I don't think I would buy this again though. Didn't hit me like the kind I had, so I'm still looking... I'm interested in trying other brands and also the white truffle for my "Truffle Research". :)

review/summary: Great Finishing Oil
review/text: My first experience with truffle oil is a real pleasure.  Very pleased with this product.  A "finishing" oil, not a "cooking" oil, just a few drops sprinkled over, or stirred into prepared foods just before serving, adds a whole new level of delicious taste.  Have enjoyed trying it sprinkled on eggs, fish, NY Strip steak, potatoes, tossed into hot pasta, tossed salad, hot vegetables ...<br />outstanding on mashed potatoes!<br /><br />I have two 3.4-ounce bottles and before opening a bottle, telephoned Roland Products to confirm that the small shaving or two that I could see floating in the bottom of each bottle was, as I suspected, actual black truffle shavings.  That impressed me.  The ingredients on the labels are: extra-virgin olive oil; black truffle (tuber aestvum vin); black truffle aroma.  Product of Italy.

review/summary: The best truffle oil I have tried.  Amazing, delicious and sensual...
review/text: I received this oil as a Christmas gift and I couldn't be happier!<br />It is hard to put into words how amazing and absolutely wonderful this oil is, what it does for food and how it seduces the taste buds.<br />I recently ordered a different highly rated truffle oil and was so dissappointed that I have no other choice but to get rid of that oil and order more Roland truffle oil.<br />My only complaint is that I can't order a larger bottle that the 3.4 ounce 2-pack.  Hey Roland, how about gallon bottles of this stuff?<br />Love it, love it, love it.<br /><br />Thank you for such an amazing and pure truffle flavored oil.

review/text: For those hazelnut lovers out there, you MUST TRY THIS!!!  I had no problems with the product as far as separation.  A good thorough mixing remedies this and I put some that was a little more solidified in the microwave for a few seconds to soften and then it mixed up just fine.<br /><br />I used the recipe on the label to make the filling for a brownie torte I made over the holidays.  People RAVED over it.  Someone even said it would win contests if I entered it into a baking contest.  And I HATE TO BAKE!  I plan on purchasing the 2 pack next time and can't wait to make the full cake recipe from the label, ice cream and other deserts with it!

These are much sweeter than the plain cherries and one eats them as if they are candy.  Everybody loves them and are so surprised when I tell them that they are cherries!  One cannot distinguish between these cherries and the dried cranberries. Recommend!

I bought many boxes of them to combine with simple dried cherries, chocolate-covered cherries and natural almonds for healthy half-pound holiday treat bags and they were a real crowd-pleaser.  The only problem is that you can't stop eating them! Please note, the seller doesn't gift wrap so if you send the box to someone else, what you see is what they get.  Not fancy, but absolutely delicious.

review/summary: The most bang for the buck for your daily cuppa
review/text: Lipton Yellow Label is CTC (crush, tear, curl) processed black Indian tea. Lipton makes it for the UK and India markets where folks take their tea with milk and sugar. CTC tea looks a little like coarse coffee grounds, and it brews quickly into a dark robust liquor that can stand up to milk and sugar. Some tea drinkers say the process gains heartiness, but at the cost subtlety and perfume.<br />  CTC makes a stronger brew than leaf tea or (ewww) tea bags. Start with � tsp of Yellow Label per cup, and steep for just three minutes, and adjust to taste next time. I find a second extraction (six-minute steep) to be quite drinkable. Again, a matter of taste.<br />  I settled on Yellow Label for my daily cuppa after trying several kinds of leaf tea over the years. I also tried Tetley, another CTC blend, but found it one-dimensional and heavy. Single-estate leaf teas still delight my Inner Tea Snob, but their cost makes them occasional treats, not daily tipples.<br />  And it's on the scale of value for money where Yellow Label is a clear winner. I know of no other tea in its price range that tastes as good. Yes, you can find teas that offer more complexity, subtlety and bouquet - for a lot more money.<br />  If you're looking for a daily cuppa that delivers real tea satisfaction for just pennies a cup, it's hard to go wrong with Yellow Label. Start with the one-lb box (about $11). Two two-lb boxes ($35) are even better value, but that's a year's worth of tea in my house.

review/text: I have been drinking Lipton Loose Leaf Tea my whole life.  The tea in this large box is not the same as the tea in the 1/2 lb. boxes.  It is a different texture- kind of like little pebbles- and it definitely does not taste the same.  I thought it would be more cost effective to order the larger package, but now I have to figure out a way to get rid of this tea and re-order the smaller boxes.  Maybe I can add it to my compost pile!  I just wish I had known.

I'll drink even more tea now, because of both the excellent taste and the value.

review/text: A delicious great tasting product by Pepperidge Farm that normally cost you $2.49 per bag, sometimes on sale at the supermarket 2 for $4.00, but I picked my Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Graham Goldfish Crackers (Pack Of 8) through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com and shipped free to my home for an awesome price of ONLY $10.63!!! If you can get a deal like this I highly suggest purchasing it right away! If not, no worries and try getting it a little more than my bargain for no more $13.00 in my opinion, seeing as if you were to pay the retail suggested price on bag for $2.49 X 8 = $19.92 would still be a bargain if you look at it this way like I do! Good Luck and happy bargain shopping, ENJOY!!!

When you can't have a campfire and you've got the craving for S'mores, Pepperidge Farms had created an awesome FUN FISH!<br />Zany as Zany can be - Vanilla Gold Fish, Chocolate Goldfish, and of course - Marshmallow Goldfish - Stack'em up; but make sure<br />you hide your evidence if you want these to be ALL YOURS or otherwise they'll be gone before you get a chance to be a "kid at<br />heart"! Having bought two bags... thinking I would like these very much (how right I was!)...<br /><br />I was downright impressed, while not the traditional S'mores - but gee whiz; I actually ate the whole danged bag in one sitting<br />without even realizing it! *blush*  It was so much fun hunting or is it fishing (?) for one after another and then stacking them<br />together and eating "fishbait" - hahahahahaha!<br /><br />Next day, began to open the other bag (already!) and started to munch away ....<br /><br />Until, my grandchildren saw the "evidence" and wahhh :( - Poor Grandma here - ended up having to "share" and goodness gracious,<br />the laughter and giggles from the little ones were far worth it all!<br /><br />I 10,000 times recommend this ... this is the best ever from Pepperidge Farms! Way to go! Now if they can come up with the big box,<br />I'd buy it on Amazon in a heartbeat! Who would ever dream that Pepperidge Farms would come up with this? Just awesome!<br /><br />Interestingly, the very next day; while I had to babysit the youngest grandchild for a short time; she went off looking for something<br />that I had to inquire what she was looking for and she kept saying Whitey, Blackie and Creamy.  Looking everywhere in my room even<br />under the bed, leaving me totally bewildered until she sulked and said<br /><br />"Grandma, where did you hide them?"<br /><br />"Hide what?"<br /><br />"The 3 goldfishies"<br /><br />(puzzled)<br /><br />"The 3 Goldfishes? We don't have Goldfish in the house."<br /><br />(now she is mad with her arms folded)<br /><br />"Yes we do, we ate them yessteday! Grandma, where did you hide them?"<br /><br />(trying not to laugh)<br /><br />"Sweetie, we ate them all up yesterday."<br /><br />"Grandma, buy more. I like them lots! Tummy hungry, says want more goldfish."<br /><br />(points to her stomach)<br /><br />Kids are adorable! &lt;3  If you buy them, make sure you stash some for yourself, they are completely<br />and you just cannot resist them!

review/summary: Messy but Tasty!
review/text: We started giving these to our 9-month-old son when he cut his first two teeth. He LOVES them...we're talking devours them. They melt easily in his mouth, so we're not too worried about him choking on them (I tried them first to make sure they were OK for him), but he gets practice self-feeding and biting into it. They are actually better for him to actually BITE on than the Baby Mum-Mums that we have, since they are thicker and don't just break off with his lips or in his hand easily like the Mum-Mums.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with these is the mess. They get EVERYWHERE! We have since decided that he can only have them in his high chair wearing a bib, and even then they are sure to get all over the place. We will still give them to him because he likes them so much, sometimes they are the only thing that pleases him. Please be aware of the mess, and that they do leave marks on clothing that will need to be washed afterwards.

review/text: Several of the cookies in the box were broken and there were quite a few crumbs in the bottom of the box. I tried a cookie and it tastes just like a Maria biscuit. It could definitely have used a little less sugar for young children. Many of the cookies are hollow and when you break it in half, it falls apart. They are too fragile to put in a ziplock bag in a purse or so, it would turn into crumbles right away. I am not sure why they are called biter biscuits since it does give much of a workout for teethers either. I find the Banana Cookies from Gerber Graduates a much better choice (denser, less messy and does not crumble).

(You can manipulate the delivery date for your next shipment if you haven't used all 12 by the time the next delivery rolls around.)  With the 15% discount, I ended up paying less than what I would pay at the grocery store.  What a great deal!  I'm trying to be better about my dietary intake which is why I ordered the lower sodium product.  I can't tell a discernable difference between this and regular Cream of Mushroom.

review/text: Unlike the regular Campbell's Mushroom Soup, this has very little flavor. 4 cans are so badly dented that they may be unsafe to use, remaining 8 cans were also dented.  Outside box has no damage, so the cans were apparently dented prior to shipment.  Cancelling subscription to this disappointing purchase.

review/summary: Lacks flavor
review/text: When I read the positve reviews on this product, I ordered it.  It is definitely low sodium and if you have a medical condition that requires very low sodium,  this soup would fit the bill.  If you are just trying to cut back on salt, again this soup will work fine.  I personally feel that most of our food has way too much salt and sugar in it so I thought I would give this product a try.  I like the convenience of it being ready to serve but I must admit, it has very little flavor.  It's almost like drinking water with a slight mushroom taste.  Truthfully, I miss the salt.  I think that soup, generally, needs salt but as I stated, most are much too salty, however, this soup is just too bland.  When I added a little bit of salt, that made a big difference.  Also, I noticed that the soup is very watery and thin.  I like my mushroom soup a little more substantial.  I do think this soup would work very well in casserole recipes.  I probably will not purhase the low sodium variety of Campbell's Mushroom Soup but I do like many of their other products.  However, and this is important, if it is an absolute necessity that you cut back on salt for health reason, then this soup would be perfect for you. Some non-salt seasoning could make it more flavorful.  I give Campbell's credit for trying to make their products more health conscious.  More companies should do the same.  Salt and sugar must and should be reduced -- a little can go a long way.

review/summary: Yuk
review/text: I bought this for my 3 year old daughter through Amazon. When it came, I opened one up and microwaved it and tried to feed it to her. The first thing she said after she tasted it was "YUK." I tasted it myself and she was right. This thing is extremely flavorless, Can't even taste the Cream of Mushroom. I can't describe the taste but it seemed like Campbell's main ingredient was water, then they added some other stuff for show but was still able to retain the "watery" taste for some strange reason-seriously this thing has no flavor whatsoever. Even when I dumped a ton of Salt and Pepper I could not make out where the "Cream of Mushroom" went.<br /><br />I would give this a 0 or 1 star rating but after I looked at the can and seen that it was Low Sodium, I can't fault Campbell because they did warn me. It was more my fault for not realizing this was the Low Sodium version but I didn't think Low Sodium meant No Flavor. My daughter loves the regular Cream of Mushroom soup but from now on I'm going to stay away form the "Low Sodium" version of anything. For those that require a Low Sodium diet, this soup might be for you. Don't purchase this 12 pack until you went to the supermarket and bought the Low Sodium version first to try it out.

review/summary: High blood pressure people will be very pleased!
review/text: It's true - this soup has no taste at all.  However,<br />that shouldn't stop you from buying it and adding other<br />spices to it that will give it some taste.  This is so<br />low sodium, it will not harm your blood pressure, and<br />that is very good news.  If you are like me, you have<br />accidentally not read a label first and ate something<br />and then spent the next several hours being really sick<br />because the food had so much salt that it drove your<br />blood pressure up sky high.  This will give you a new<br />choice of something to eat that you won't have to worry<br />about.  Get some curry, garlic, pepper, or some other<br />spices and you can fix the problem of it not having any<br />taste.  I bought 24 cans of this, and I'm not sorry. Now<br />I have something to eat that won't kill me.

review/text: The Cheezy Chipotle flavour is my favorite. Plus, this is a very healthy snack. I highly recommend them but if you have a Whole Foods near you DO NOT BUY THEM HERE for this insane price. Whole Foods sells them for $4.99 and they are frequently on sale. Today I bought a bag for $4.29. In fact, I only buy them on sale as I consider $4.99 too expensive for 2.2 ounces of dried kale (let alone the $5.99 being charged here on Amazon.)<br /><br />Considering how seriously expensive Whole Foods stores are, and how online selling doesn't incur the same overhead expenses as retail stores do, the makers of Kale Krunch are TRULY ripping people off here for 2.2 ounces of dried kale. Great product. Questionable company ethics.

review/summary: Disgusting beyond words.
review/text: I have never written an Amazon review before, but I feel like it is my duty to prevent other people from eating these abominations.<br /><br />I love kale chips. And I am more than familiar with nutritional yeast & nut "cheeze." But this stuff was disgusting.<br /><br />I ate one piece and thought "hm, that doesn't taste like kale at all." I tried one more piece - it was a tiny fluff of kale smeared with a full ounce or so of the "cheeze" garbage. I tried a third one and almost hurled. So...no. It tastes old, the texture is crusty, there is very little kale and tons of gross "cheeze."<br /><br />Also, note the price. Do you really want to pay that? For anything???<br /><br />Basically, everything is wrong with these kale chips. They are offensive to every sense, and cost way too much. Just make your own kale chips. It's not hard.

review/text: These and the Quite Cheezy are my favorites.  Not sure what's going on with this company though... they keep reinventing themselves, their brand, etc. I wish they would stabilize so they could bring the price down a bit. $6.00 is a lot for 2.2 ounces of snack food. Despite the fact they are good AND good for you, they are a once-in-a while treat, and let's face it... you can't portion out the 2.2 oz bag for more than one day.  Ya gotta eat 'em.  They're too good and they will haunt you until they're gone.  Your body will like them because they're good for it.  Your wallet will spit in your face though.  I found these today at a rather expensive natural food store today ON SALE for $3.99 a bag. I bought 3, and one of them even had a $1 off coupon affixed to it.  SCORE!

This is the case for most of Teavana's teas, when your in the store they waft the smell of the tea toward you and your like WOW I bet that tastes amazing.... then you later taste it and its only ok... The Earl gray is not very traditional compared to other teas like Twinings and Harriods... Being from London and growing up on earl gray this tea is not horrible but there are better teas out there. Its seems like an American twist on an English classic, but if your like me and like that traditional English taste, this is not the way to go.

review/summary: tuna with a sickly sweet taste....
review/text: After trying some of the bumblebee flavored tunas and a few of the starkist ones I really hoped that this would be as good. I was wrong. To start out with the tuna in the can is not even close to the others quality. The other brands are more of a fillet stamped out and canned. This is tiny chuncks crammed into a can with a sickly sweey sauce. I would guess it is about 60% tuna 40% sauce. I like sweet chili sauce.... I like tuna.... I dont like this though.<br /><br />UPDATE: --- I thought I had come up with a good way to get rid of this tuna. I would feed it to my dog. My dog (which loves tuna) just refused to eat this. I guess she would rather eat dogfood than this product!

It was "hit and miss" finding the 40 count Decaf Bigelow Green Tea in local stores...so, that's when I started ordering from Amazon.com.<br />I am amazed at all the products available at Amazon! They also carry the Organic Decaf Bigelow Green Tea.  The quality and taste of this tea is very good.  It comes in 10 foil pouches of 4 tea bags within the box of tea.  Because my F-i-l drinks several cups of tea a day, we empty a box of tea and keep it in a sealed canister on the kitchen counter.  I usually order 12 boxes at a time.  It's so nice to "stock-up" on a favorite, hard to find item...eliminating the frequent store searches.  The price is also very competitive...and free shipping to our door!

I could not tell you how many unused boxes we have thrown out.  This is one of my top two choices (the other being Uncle Lee).  It has a very pleasing flavor, neither being too weak or too strong.  We drink it iced and allow 1 cup water per bag with a 5 minute brew time in the warmed tea pot.  My husband makes it at work using an electric ice tea brewing machine.  It is very refreshing and I always feel quite virtuous drinking it! I was very pleased to find it available on Amazon in the Subscribe and Save program.  It is offered at an excellent price with the convenience of home delivery.  Even though we shop in the metro Dallas/Ft. Worth area, it is still somewhat difficult to find.  It is also very convenient packaging.  I usually prefer to make a quart at a time, because brewed tea looses much of its' charm when it sits too long.  Each envelope makes exactly a quart!  We do not drink this hot, as we usually choose herbal blends for hot tea.  The reason I choose this one over Uncle Lee is pure economics--it's a better buy through the Subscribe and Save program.  Thank you Bigelow and thank you Amazon!

review/summary: I will buy this tea again
review/text: The taste is great - can't even tell it's decaf.  Packaging prevents tea from going stale.  Only complaint is that the teabags are really only meant for a 6 oz cup of tea.  A tall mug needs 2 teabags.

review/summary: Bigelow is the way to go for regular green tea
review/text: This decaf green tea is my favorite.  I have tried a few but this is probably my favorite in taste.  My mom is not a tea drinker but this tea is the only one she drinks.  I haven't tried the one that says organic on the box, so not really sure what the difference is.  This one in particular is great.  I drink like 3 or 4 cups a day and I think it has made me more relaxed and just overall healthier.  I think they put less tea in the bags than Celestial Seasonings does, but I don't know if that's a bad thing.  The taste is perfect.
