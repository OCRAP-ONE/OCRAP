review/summary: I use it with my Iced Tea
review/text: I like my Iced Tea to have a bit of a sweetness with a moderate lemon flavor, so I use these packs to flavor it while still having nearly 0 calories. Never tried it just plain, so I can't vouch for it that way. For this purpose, I find it a great option since you get so much for the price.

review/summary: A great morning tea from Twining
review/text: Irish blend from Twining has a pleasing crisp taste, just a bit spicy, fragrant and hearty, not so robust as a Kenya, but much more than a gentle Darjeeling. If you have tried Twining's English Breakfast blend, you should expect this Irish Breakfast blend to be stronger and more complex in flavor, but with similar brewing properties.<br /><br />You can buy Irish Breakfast blend either in teabags or as loose bulk tea. I strongly recommend the latter for greater flexibility, but the bags taste just as good -- no flavor that I can detect from the paper that Twining uses.<br /><br />Twining produces some excellent teas, none better than this fine blend. It has my strongest recommendation. It is also available as a decaffeinated tea, with very much the same delightful taste.

review/summary: The Emerald Island's Favorite Blend.
review/text: Did you know that the Irish - *not* the English - are per capita the world's highest consumers of tea? No wonder, then, that there is a breakfast blend named for them; although Irish Breakfast is actually strong enough to be a great pick-me-up throughout the day. Traditionally, it consists primarily of teas from Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and the state of Assam in northeastern India. Irish Breakfast has an intricately full-bodied, malty, floral aroma and goes particularly well with milk (or cream, but real milk is preferable). Enjoy!

review/summary: Bad loose leaf tea
review/text: This is NOT a loose leaf tea.  More like tea dust.  I like Twinings just fine and like to have some standard black tea around so that if I buy a flavored tea that is too strong in flavor, I can mix with unflavored black.  The crumbs in this canister were so bad I had to go out and buy tea bags.  It cannot be used in an infuser.  It is also noticeable that the flavor is far weaker than the Irish Breakfast tea they sell in the bags.  Nearly worthless as a loose leaf tea.  Wish I hadn't purchased.

review/text: I get tired of drinking plain water and carbonated soda all of the time.  Crystal Light Strawberry Orange Banana mix adds Zing to your water.  The flavor is pretty good and the fact that it contains no calories helps me reduce my calories and sugar consumption.  I also like the fact that it does not have any caffeine in it.<br /><br />Drinking a non-carbonated beverage is better for my stomach and I like the flavor of this mix.  It is a good change up to drink and my family drinks a lot of Crystal Light beverages.<br /><br />If you are watching your calories, trying to lose weight or need to reduce your caffeine consumption, this product is a good choice!

review/summary: In terms of flavor it was better than expected
review/text: My husband and I drink a good amount of Crystal Light powdered beverages. I was initially very leery of purchasing this particular flavor.  The combination, particularly for a powder based beverage, sounded like a disaster in the making.  In the end, I can say that it was better than expected.  In terms of flavor, I think a kid (or the kid at heart) would enjoy this more than an adult.<br /><br />Some notes on flavor, color, and packaging:<br /><br />Flavor:  Compared to other Crystal Light beverages, the flavor of strawberry orange banana is actually quite complex.  You can taste each of those flavors in the beverage.  While a fine combination of flavors, something about it screams "kid".  It is just not what I would serve to a fellow adult on a hot day.<br /><br />Color: Like many of the flavors in the Crystal Light Light, the Strawberry Orange Banana is a rather vibrant color once mixed; it is a deep pink color.  It looks very artificial (which, admittedly, this beverage is).  If color is important to you, Crystal Light does have some subtlety colored options.  For example, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> looks like cloudy water but tastes like mint and lime.<br /><br />Packaging: One negative with all of the Crystal Light products relates to packaging. First, the container is a #5 plastic. Unless you live in a relatively progressive place, #5 plastics are typically very difficult to recycle. I know Whole Foods engages in a recycling initiative to collect #5 plastics but if you don't live near one and you care about recycling, these can be a challenging item to deal with. Additionally, if you like Crystal Light, it can be very easy to go through these containers quickly. Some Crystal Light flavors, like the strawberry orange banana, have six packets and others have five. The container could hold more flavor packets, which would reduce the overall number of containers that the user has to dispose of.<br /><br />Overall, a fine beverage that is encased in packaging that is not very green. If you are looking for a more adult option, I would suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9RY">Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink Mix (10-Quart), 3.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9OC">Crystal Light Pink Lemonade Drink Mix (8-Quart), 1.9-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a>.<br /><br />3.5 - 4 stars

review/text: Tully's Kona coffee must be a very popular K-cup since it is very difficult to find, both on-line and in stores. The bold taste with very little acid or bitter after taste makes it a really delicious coffee. When it is available, it is the only coffee that I drink.

review/text: Tully's Coffee Kona Blend is wonderfully addictive !  Beats out any of it's competitors !  We love to have a cup or two in the morning to start out the day.  The packaging was a little beat up due to scrunching of the boxes, but the contents inside were in perfect condition.  I recommend anyone using K-cups to try this flavorful coffee.

review/summary: bitter while being expensive
review/text: I like bold coffe and historically have really enjoyed Kona coffee or blend. But this is bitter, harsh and tastes like tree bark.  Less expensive k-cups are bold and smooth, for example I like Tully French Roast. (The Italian roast is about as bitter as the Kona).  I am pleased I only puchased two boxes of this stuff.

review/summary: Strong Stuff
review/text: This lavender extract is very, very strong. More potent than I expected actually. I added one teaspoon to a cupcake recipe and it was overpowering. I ended up adding extra vanilla to tone it down and it worked but next time I will probably only use a half teaspoon of lavender. Any kind of flavoring needs to be experimented with to achieve your personal tastes so I'm not complaining. It's really perfect for baking with. Stronger than lavender water and not sugary like lavender syrup. And the fact that you get a 4oz bottle is great. This stuff will last me quite a while. Between that and the fact that I can't find this in physical stores, the price is well worth it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to add lavender flavor to a recipe. Just remember that to some people it might be "soapy" tasting as here in the states flower flavors aren't commonly eaten but they're commonly in perfumes and soaps. When you get used to the flavor it's positively delightful though. :)

review/summary: It really kills early or middle phase cancers
review/text: 8 years ago, I was desperate trying to find a natural remedy for my brother's early phase liver cancer since surgery would almost destroy the body and my brother won't live long after that and he was too young to lose life.  Luckily my coworker suggested me to try Essiac Cancer Remedy. I did a through research on Essiac and believed this tea was going to save my brother's life and it DID. He is still well till now.  Later I suggested this tea to a few more cancer patients and the results were promising.  Two of them with early cancers were healed; the doctor just couldn't find any cancer trace on the pre-scheduled surgery table.  There are 2 late phase cancer patients (late means cancer had been spread to different organs and the person was dying), who drank the tea and lived a few more months and died peacefully without any pain and sufferings, which proved what said in one of the Essiac books that the tea helps with a painless death if it's a Terminal cancer. I also learned that the results are much better with patients who eat little or no animal products because animal food acidifies the body, speeds up cancer spreading and weakens the immune system --- in 1931, Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize for showing that "cancer thrives in acidic conditions."  For more information about this tea, you may read related books on "Essiac".  I hope more western people will believe that the best heal is often the most nature and simplest which God created in the very beginning.

review/summary: Cancer pain
review/text: My father recently passed away from cancer.  It began as colon cancer, and he was almost dead from it when he finally went to the hospital.  It was stage three at that time.  He underwent emergency surgery at that time (almost three years ago), and was in ICU for almost a month.  We thought we were going to lose him right then and there.  He recovered but refused chemotherapy.  He also would not take the pre-mixed Flor Essence I got him after his recovery, although I didn't know that until I found it in his refrigerator back in December of 2009.  It was opened, and it appeared that he had sampled it, but that was all.  As the cancer progressed, it invaded his small intestine, his lungs, his liver, and completely involved his peritoneum.  When he was sent home from the hospital the last time, in April 2010, after surgical bypass for the tumor in his small intestine, he was placed on Hospice.  We knew there was very little chance of saving his life, but he was finally ready to try.  I put him on the Flor Essence, which I had bought locally.  As the weeks passed, the Hospice nurses and the alternative therapies doctor he began seeing were amazed that he was having so little pain.  In fact, he rarely needed a Percocet and only seemed to have pain in his left shoulder and arm (the natural therapies doctor said that was because of the location of the tumor pressing against his diaphragm which caused the shoulder on that side to ache).  About three weeks after his return from the hospital, I ordered a different Essiac tea from the Internet that said it had clinical trials proving its effectiveness, etc., etc.  My mother started him on the new tea and, as that week went on, his pain increased to the point that he was needing a Percocet every 2-3 hours.  Knowing the only thing we had changed was the tea, I immediately started him back on the Flor Essence.  The very first day, he became slightly nauseous again (a side effect he had from the beginning with Flor Essence, the natural therapies doctor said this was because it was killing cancer cells), and his pain decreased to the point that, once again, he only needed a Percocet occasionally.  The difference was so dramatic it was almost unbelievable.  Unfortunately, our measures were too little, too late, to save his life, but when he passed away (exactly six weeks after being sent home from the hospital), he was having no pain and had not had a Percocet in 36 hours.<br /><br />Please, if you have cancer, don't refuse to fight, as my father did. Fight it with everything you have.  His worry was how much it would cost his family monetarily.  We tried to convince him that we loved him more than the money it cost, but he couldn't let us pay for his treatment.  It just wasn't in him to allow it.  But, whatever treatment you try, be it surgery, chemo, radiation, or natural treatments, add Flor Essence to your regimen from the beginning.  Although the Flor Essence I ordered on Amazon did not arrive prior to my father's passing, I kept the packages of tea I had ordered and gave them to my family members.  Everyone can benefit from the cleansing power of Flor Essence and, after seeing what it did for my father's pain, I would recommend it to anyone fighting a painful disease.  And, please, don't trust in the effectiveness of other Essiac tea products.  I learned the hard way and will always regret that I caused my father pain he need not have had in his final days.  Flor Essence is the Real Deal.<br /><br />One final note.  If you have cancer, or any other painful disease, may God Bless You, and may you find this review to be helpful to you.

review/summary: Flor-Essence
review/text: I believe this tea really works. Ten years ago I had cancer in my throat. I went through the usual "cut, burn, & poison treatments." Then a friend who had cancer in both lungs sent me some Flor-Essence to try. I used up what she sent and bought more. She told me her story that convinced me to try it, They were going to do surgery on one lung at a time. When that one healed they would do the other one. While she was recovering from the first surgery she started drinking Flor-Essence. When it was time to have the surgery on the other lung they ran some tests to see how bad the cancer was. There was no cancer where there had been before.<br /><br /> Recently I went in to have them check my prostate and after having a biopsy they found cancer. (less than 1%) The Dr. wanted to do surgery right away. I declined and went to Amazon and ordered the tea. I'm not saying you should do this but after the treatments I took the first time and how it has taken my strength, destroyed my thyroid, and having to have all my teeth pulled. I don't think my body could go through that again.<br /><br /> To sum it up. I for one believe it works. If you want some interesting reading get "The Essiac Report" It deserves to be read.

review/summary: A Remarkable Tea
review/text: In December of 2010 my 52 year old wife was diagnosed with stage 4 liver cancer. The doctors gave us no hope, no treatment, and suggested that we enter into hospice. Our son took it upon himself to research possible alternatives and the first was Essiac tea. This is the basic component of the Flor-Essence tea. The jury is still out as far as to whether it will be a cure for my wife's cancer, but I began taking it along with her and must admit that for me the effects have been remarkable. I have had a nasty case of psoriasis for 18 years. Dozens of trips to dermatologists and thousands of dollars worth of medication have not been able to arrest my condition like the Essiac/Flor-Essence tea has. The "anger" has subsided in my skin rashes and in just 2 months the sites have begun to clear up. In my case taking the tea has definitely boosted my immune system. Initially a cousin also tried the tea and after 3 days passed a kidney stone.<br />At present my wife is completely free of pain and doing reasonably well.<br />Some users complain about the taste, but it just tastes like celery or turnip juice. It would be foolish to let the flavor stop you from trying to heal yourself.<br />This product has a colorful history, but it can definitely help.

review/summary: Terrific for Detox!
review/text: I've been suffering some fairly severe health issues for the last few months, due to adrenal depletion. In my research on this, I've discovered that fatigued adrenals can overload the liver and gallbladder. Well, recently I realized that my adrenals are much stronger than before, so something else was amiss, resulting in my feeling fatigued constantly. When I developed a lipoma on my calf, I figured my lymphatic system was congested. I bought a liver detox kit and used it for a few weeks, but I didn't really notice any results.<br /><br />Then I found websites talking about essiac tea. I had never heard of it, but people were making some pretty remarkable claims about it. As per usual, I immediately came to amazon to see what people here had to say about it (I feel confident that the reviews here are authentic). When I typed in "essiac tea" in the search module, it brought up Flor Essence. This product had terrific reviews, and I'd read how great it is for detoxing; so I figured, what have I got to lose?<br /><br />People claim that it has cured their cancer. I can't make a comment on that, because as far as I know, I've got no cancer. But after taking this tea for a few days, I can definitely state that it seems quite potent medicinally. I've been taking 2 oz. of the brewed tea with 2 oz. hot water, 3 times a day. The third day I started feeling the typical flu-like symptoms of detox, and by day 4 I woke up feeling like a truck had hit me. My allergies and chemical sensitivities got really bad. I had a lot of sinus congestion. I could feel this stuff working. It's been a little over a week now, and it's still working great. I think the worst of the detox is over. I also started taking milk thistle and quercetin with vitamin C, and I think those supplements are assisting in the detox.<br /><br />Also, my boyfriend who never really thought he had digestive tract issues started taking this tea, just to maintain his health. Within a few days, he started seeing some nasty stuff (i.e. Candida, etc) come out in his bowel movements. So I guess this tea is also terrific for actually killing any parasites one may have. I can't say that it will do so for everyone, but he and I are both having success with the tea. We even recommended it to his parents to try and are telling our friends about it. It's not difficult to brew at all. After reading reviews where people said it was hard to do, I expected it to be grueling. It really doesn't take that long to prepare. Most of the time is spent allowing the tea to brew overnight. When I make the tea, I'd say it takes me about 30 minutes in the evening and about 10 minutes the following morning.<br /><br />If you're looking to detox, give this a go. Don't increase the dosage beyond the recommended amount (as I'm apt to do, because I always want to speed things up!), because if you do, you'll feel awful. But this day in age, I think it's all vital that we complete a detox every few months or so. Our bodies simply have yet to catch up with the toxin overload created by the modern world. I've tried a few detox remedies, and this one, by far, is my favorite. I intend to use this tea for a very long time, if not for life.

review/summary: Flor-Essence Worked for Us - Cancer Free
review/text: My husband has taken the Flor-Essence tea since 1996 when he was initially diagnosed with Stage 2 prostate cancer. After being diagnosed with the cancer in 1995, he underwent radiation therapy. At the time, it appeared the radiation was successful since his PSA levels were normal. As you might imagine, we were both ecstatic about this. However, this happiness was short-lived.<br /><br />In 1996, a follow up PSA test showed the PSA level had started to increase. His urologist said this was not good believing the radiation did not get all of the cancer.<br /><br />After consulting with a local health food expert, I started my husband on the Flor-Essence tea, Flora Pro-Essence (specifically for the prostate), and modified citrus pectin (known to kill cancer cells). During an exam, his urologist told us after reviewing his PSA level (now normal), "I don't what you are doing, but whatever it is it's working."<br /><br />Fifteen years later and still taking all three products, my husband remains cancer free and his PSA levels normal.<br /><br />We sincerely believe by taking these products it literally saved his life. The tea is a natural, gentle cleansing product which also helped him more easily recover from the serious side effects of the radiation therapy.<br /><br />I also take the Flor-Essence tea and find it helps my immune system. Rarely (if ever), do I get colds or the flu. The tea also helps both of us sleep better at night.<br /><br />We are so thankful for the Flor-Essence tea.

review/summary: Saving Whisper's Life!
review/text: Update: 3-9-12<br /><br />Tomorrow marks the six-month anniversary of Whisper's attack.  It's hard to wrap my mind around that with an objective perspective.  He's going to get steamed salmon filet to celebrate, and I will celebrate by trying to continue to spread the word about this wonderful tea!<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, there is a bulk package available through amazon.com that makes 14 gallons for $70.00.  The bulk essiac came yesterday.  It is in four packets of ingredients, with 2lb burdock root, 1lb sheep sorrel, 4oz slippery elm and one ounce Turkish rhubarb root.  Those are the ingredients in both my books on making it yourself.  The Flora product also includes kelp,blessed thistle and red clover, none of which other than red clover are mentioned in either book that I have read, although they suggest adding a bit of bloodroot for hard cancers.<br /><br />I should be able to accurately measure out portions to brew whatever amount I like at a time.  I'm probably going to try for two quart batches and see how long that carries Spirit and me.  Whisper will remain on the Flora product. I can be pretty scientific about the preparation, but I'm going to quote an Ojibwah medicine man from "Essiac, A Native Herbal Cancer Remedy" by Cynthia Olson.<br /><br />"I use a big handful of chopped, dried burdock root (My hands are kind of big.  This weighs about 3 ounces.).  Then I use a big handful of sheep sorel. This weighs about 1 ounce.  Then I use big pieces of dried rhubarb root, amounting to about 1/2 ounce (I use bige pieces so the laxative effect is not boiled away).  Then I add a wad of slippery elm (inside bark) about the size of a golf ball.  This won't move most scales (about 1/18 of an ounce).  This makes about one week's supply, so boil in one gallon of water, then let it soak overnight, strain it in a one gallon apple juice jar and store in your fridge.  Drink one 8 ounce cup twice a day.  More if you feel like it.<br /><br />Don't dillute it.  That some whimpy white man's health food store thinking.  It tastes kind of thick and slippery.  If you heat it, do it in a small saucepan on a burner.  Don't ever use a microwave or it will be useless.  By the way, when you drink it, pray that your body will get back in harmony with The Great Spirit."<br /><br />I think this may be the best way for me to prepare it, although I will probably see what my particular hand measurements amount to.  Also, it looks as if everything in the packets is pretty well powdered, so it may force me into weight measurements.  I like the medicine man's philosophy.<br /><br />Also, since for spirit and me, it is more for purification than "cure" (knock on wood!), we will probably take a couple of ounces per day, each...we'll see what the results are and adust it.  I'll keep you posted.<br /><br />Six-month portraits of Whisper will follow!<br /><br />Update: 1-31-12  I've added two more photos of Whisper, taken this evening.  I don't have much to add, other than the fact that his blood-work is normal, and I continue to give him daily doses of Essiac tea.  I will always do anything to keep Whisper and Spirit in my life, as long as theirs have quality.  I can ask for no more the joy they give me daily!<br /><br />Update:  !2-4-11  A picture is worth 1,000 words, and if you look at the photos I just uploaded, you will see two sweet critters who are the pictures of health!!!<br /><br />Update:  10-26-11  Whisper continues to thrive!  I have not seen him act so playfully for a couple of years, at least.  He is happy, accessible and loving.  His appetite is very good.  He threw up once the week before last, which was scary.  The vomit was dark brown and the consistency of espresso coffee.  Although it was unnerving, he seemed fine afterward.  It was a single incident, and may have been part of the process of his body purifying itself.<br /><br />Spirit has not needed Rimadyl and continues to be extremely playful.  I have been taking a couple of ounces per day a couple of days a week, and even at low-dose, I feel more energetic.<br /><br />Tonight I added photos of the brewing process.  It isn't the simplest thing in the world, but it takes about fifteen minutes of your actual attention.  Remember, the Drs at the emergency hospital told me Whisper had only days...or weeks, at best before he would die.  When he came home, I had almost no hope.  Yesterday, I received my second box of tea.  We haven't consumed all of the first.  I've given a portion of it to friends who also have animals with serious illness.<br /><br />We live in a toxic world, and Big Medicine will try to separate us from our money by nuking us with toxic chemicals and procedures while draining our money if we let them.  There are viable alternatives.<br /><br />Essiac Tea is one of the most potent, but there is also colloidal silver as an antibiotic that is gentle, effective and works over and over, unlike prescription products.  Olive leaf extract also fights many infections safely, and for UTIs, try Usnea and Uva Ursi tincture.  Just those few remedies, with the recent addition of the essiac tea, have kept me disease-free for years.  Don't forget to eat healthy food, never smoke, and if you drink, do so moderately.  Exercise daily, drink water, and thank the earth for all of the tools we have to keep healthy naturally.<br /><br />I will update this review as the treatment progresses.  So far, so much better than I had hoped!<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />On September 10th, 2011, my 12-year old cat, Whisper suddenly became near death.  I had seen him about 4:00 and he seemed fine.  At 6:30 I went to find him to give him his supper and I found him in the bathroom with his belly inflated to the size of a volleyball, a look of horror on his face, and screeming weakly.  I rushed him to the local animal emergency hospital, and by the time I got him there he was almost gone.  They rushed him to their ER, relieved the pressure and got him on multiple IVs.  The next day, they did extensive tests and determined that he has aggressive lymphoma.<br /><br />I was devastated.  I had lost his sister, Shadow, in June to a different attack, apparently from the same cause.  The vet who came to euthanize her said she thought that a large lymph gland in her abdomen had ruptured and caused a huge infection which was untreatable.<br /><br />In Whisper's case, they told me that with chemo, he might have weeks, and without it, he probably had days.  They managed to get him stable enough to take home with steroids and a special compounded prescription to restore function to his bowels, but the prognosis was grim.<br /><br />A friend of mine who had a cat who was diagnosed with a hard-tumor cancer, given two months to live and when put on essiac tea, lived 18 months and passed peacefully of heart failure told me about this brand and recommended I try it.<br /><br />I ordered it, and by the time it arrived, although he was still alive, he had become anorexic, lethargic, and I really didn't think it would do any good.  He also had caught an upper respiratory infection in the hospital.  I gave him his first four doses with an irrigating syringe, and he started eating again, coming out socially and began taking it with juice from canned salmon.<br /><br />Now, just over a month since he was released and three weeks into the tea protocol, he takes two doses with salmon juice and he and my dog, Spirit, who I found out at the same time had a mass on his rectum, both get it in one of their water dishes to drink during the day.<br /><br />Whisper has gotten back to his old sweet, loving, playful personality, has a great appetite, and plays like a kitten, running to me like a puppy!  Spirit has responded to the point that I can't locate the mass.  I've been able to take him off Rimadyl.  He was starting to have soreness after hikes and play. He can travel up the stairs with no problem, jump into the back seat of our SUV, and doesn't have the risk of upset stomach he had with Rimadyl.<br /><br />This is amazing stuff!  If I ever develop cancer, I will use it first, and ignore chemo and radiation therapies.  Until now, I had simply believed when cancer was diagnosed, it was going to get you someday, somehow...sooner or later.<br /><br />With essiac tea, I believe we have an amazing weapon, which, if it doesn't outright cure it, works better than anything I have ever seen with anyone or any animal diagnosed with cancer and from reports I have read may actually cure soft cancers such as lymphoma.<br /><br />I don't know how advanced Whisper's is, but I have seen pretty much miraculous changes in him over the shortest of times.  I will update this review as we continue using the tea, but in three short weeks, I have come from feeling despair and huge grief to believing he may be with me for a very long time!  I bond to my animals almost as much as my daughter, and I am still not over Shadow's passing.  If I had lost Whisper, I don't know what would have happened to me emotionally or spiritually.<br /><br />Over the last fifteen years I have lost nearly everyone of importance in my life except my daughter, and I am saturated with the pain of loss.<br /><br />Essiac tea has already bought me more time than I expected to have with Whisper and the fact that he has become so vital again in such a short time gives me hope that we will be together for a long time to come!<br /><br />I will update this review as I watch Whisper's progress, but right now this may be the best $25.00 I ever spent!  It cost me almost $3,000.00 to find out what he had and stabilize him.  If I had known about this when Shadow passed, I would have started him on it prophylactically.  If you or a loved one are suffering from any form of cancer, please try this.  It's a bit of a project to brew, but worth every penney and every ounce of effort!

review/summary: Hmmmm...
review/text: I don't have cancer (at least as far as I know of), but I wanted to try this product because I heard it was good at psoriasis as it is a general blood cleaner.  I will say that it was mostly putting on a sprite shower filter that really improved my skin.<br />This product seemed to give me a small immune system boost, but otherwise I didn't notice anything else about it that was particularly helpful to my health.<br />There are 3 packets in the package if you didn't know already.. each packet can make about a quart of the stuff.  So the tea isn't cheap (course considering the ingredients and the scale of production, this isn't surprising).  Useful, but if you're already healthy, I don't think it is a product that is really needed.  There are other supplements out there that offer a better bang for the buck.

review/summary: Grasping @ straws
review/text: I bought this because I'm grasping at straws. I was diagnosed with CLL (leukemia) in the latter half of 2010. Everyone that cares had all sorts of remedies to recommend. This was one of them. It, along with the other homeopathic remedies has done nothing to arrest the condition. My counts continue to rise (into abnormal range). Will it work for you? Some swear by this product as helpful. My suggestion: Buy three bottles. Take the recommended dosage "religiously" on a daily basis until you have completely depleted the supply. Have monthly blood tests. If you notice an improvement, bravo. If you don't, then you are only out about $20. Is your life worth that? I hope so.<br /><br />Update October 20, 2011: I finished all the product I had purchased and reordered 3 more boxes. I still have not realized any improvement, in fact, my last blood test came back the highest (worst) it has ever been, by a considerable leap. Still it is the ONLY thing I am doing with any consistency and it gives my wife a sense that I am not giving up on myself. However, personally, my results cannot testify in favor of this product.

I handle gluten better than most celiac sufferers, but this oatmeal really set me off.  Many of the other "Better Oats" deliberately have wheat in them.  This doesn't, but I suspect it has a fair bit by accident.  My condolences to other wheat-free folk, as this is quite possibly the most delicious oatmeal I've ever eaten.

review/summary: Tasty but disappointing
review/text: I was excited to find this oatmeal made of real, easy to pronounce ingredients which came in a short list.  The oatmeal cooks up well and tastes great.  Unfortunately the amount of flax seed in this oatmeal made me nauseous.  Unfortunately the flax seeds were also whole, which means they're offering very little nutritional benefit.  Whole flax seeds are most likely to pass through mostly undigested.  Needless to say, I won't be purchasing the oatmeal again, but I've now been inspired to make my own, healthier version.  It is as simple as tweaking the recipe to my liking, and measuring out the dry ingredients into snack sized ziploc bags.  Super easy to grab a bag for work and it's not hard to estimate the amount of water needed.  If it weren't for the amount of (whole) flax seeds, I'd definitely buy this oatmeal again.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: Living in Seattle it is not easy to find good raw Tahini especially if you are an Israeli who knows how the real thing should taste. We tried Al Wadi but found it to find a strange after taste. Also tried the MIDEAST brand (not on Amazon) but found it to be bland. For a while we were able to purchase the excellent "Prince Tahini" online but now it is almost impossible to find in a reasonable price. This Tahini on the other hand is surprisingly good, reasonably priced and very close in taste to "Prince Tahini". The label indicates it is manufactured by "Achdut" in Israel which is the same factory that manufactures the "Achva" Tahini and Halva.  It arrived well packaged with no leaks or dents. Will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Fresh and Italian-y!
review/text: I use a lot of Italian seasoning in my cooking, so I'm always looking for an inexpensive source.  We have a large family so I like to buy it in bulk.  Some of the cheaper brands I've tried have had lots of dust from the crushed herbs, and some seemed old and less pungent.<br /><br />This Spice Appeal Italian Seasoning seems to be fresh and strong, and it has very little powder in the bottle.  It comes in three large containers, each containing 6 oz. of product.  The contents are Basil, Rosemary, Savory, Oregano, Marjoram, (no fillers) in just the right proportions.  I have one of the containers in my pantry and the other two in the freezer (in ziplock bags) to preserve the freshness.<br /><br />I used it last night to make spaghetti and was very happy with it.  Just two tablespoons full seasoned a whole pot of sauce.  I also used it sprinkled on top of mozzarella slices with tomato and olive oil, as an appetizer.<br /><br />I will definitely look for this item again when I'm ready to order more Italian seasoning.  If you add something else to your order to total over $25, you will get your order shipped free.  This makes it a good value even when compared to Costco and the big box stores.

review/summary: Very Good Stout
review/text: For not boiling any ingreidients this is a great beer. Just add some hot water, syrup, malt, sugar, pitch the yeast and let ferment. Thats it. I have made a lot of beer and have never had a canned extract turn out so good. Usualy when you cook beer you are in the kitchen for hours. With coopers it only takes about 10-15 minutes and you are done not to mention it tastes as good if not better than cooked beer. Once you have taken a few sips it is very similar to Guiness. It has nice flavor and finishes with a slight bitterness. Make sure to age it properly. For maximum flavor age for at least a month. The flavor will improve greatly! Enjoy.

review/summary: Great stout!
review/text: This is so good, Surprisingly good, and it gets even better with age. I added the whole package of sugar into the brew with the dry malt "Oops,I didn't read all instructions", The instruction recommended 300g and I used 1kg, But it turned out awesome, just more alcohol.<br />So far this is my 4th brew, and I have been very happy with all Coopers products.

review/summary: Excellent Product / Bad Price
review/text: This is our favorite Crystal Light flavor! While we down gallons of it during the summer, we also drink it year-round as a flavor enhancer for our nasty-tasting tap water. However, the Amazon.com price of $22 (for 4 pkgs) is WAY more (almost twice as much!) than the $2.79 per pkg that I pay in the grocery store. Would love to buy it in bulk on Amazon.com, but it has to be a better buy!

review/summary: Cold Raspberry Ice Tea is the most refreshing Summer drink
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9V0">Crystal Light Raspberry Tea Drink Mix (12-Quart) 1.6-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>Crystal Light Raspberry Iced Tea is the drink that we use for a thirst buster while working in the hot humid summer sun or enjoyed with our meals.  It is not too sweet and is full of flavor.  It mixes quickly and the jug can go in the frig, ready for your refreshment.<br /><br />Don't know if you have ever purchased raspberry flavoring and added to your home made iced tea.  Raspberry flavoring is very pricy from my market.  Crystal Light is easier, faster and provides better value for my family with the same flavor that I would get if I took the trouble to make it myself.  Give it a try.

review/summary: I'm loving it
review/text: I drink this delightful raspberry tea year-round (un-iced in the winter), and was delighted to find it online, and less expensively than in the one store that I know carries it.  Also I discovered I could subscribe, receiving it at regular intervals by mail, which means I no longer have to make an extra stop, since the store that carries it is not where I normally trade. So now I am signed up to get a 4-pack every month, and it arrives by mail without a bit of effort on my part.  And it is not only that I personally am a big fan of this tea for its taste and lack of calories, but when I offer it to guests, they always choose it above other things I have available. A winner in my book.

review/summary: GOOD
review/text: This taste very similar to lipton iced tea with a touch of rasberry- not enough to ruin the tea taste though. it doesn't really change the flavor any more than a twist of lemon or lime changes the flavor_<br />$10 for 4- 12 quart containers is a good price. I use a 2 quart  packet of mix in a gallon of water and it still tastes good. comes out to approx .40 cents a gallon that way.
