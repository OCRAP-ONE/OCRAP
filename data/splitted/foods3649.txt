review/summary: Light and crispy with a fresh sesame flavor
review/text: I've been eating WASA and other crisp breads for a long time, but I usually get the whole grain ones. Got these at the store once and really liked them, especially because I love sesame seeds. My family also really likes these, and my friends and guests really like them, too. In fact, I bought this case of WASA to share with them, as I prefer the really heavy, hearty WASAs. WASA breads can be served in many ways: they make great crackers to go with soups, stews or chilie, or to snack on plain or with butter spread on them. I like to eat them European style by making little open-faced sandwitches. A little cheese, maybe some meat, thinly sliced cucumber, onion or what have you. A great little snack.<br /><br />This is the ingredient list:<br />Wheat flour, sesame seeds, water, yeast, canola and palm oil, sugar, salt. May contain traces of milk.<br /><br />Nutrition facts:<br />  Calories 60<br />  Total Fat 1.5g<br />  Saturated Fat 1.5g<br />  Trans Fat 1.5g<br />  Sodium 85mg<br />  Total Carbohydrate 9g<br />  Dietary Fiber &lt;1g<br />  Sugars 0g<br />  Protein 2g<br /><br />The expiration date is 31 October 2012

review/summary: Best Bread on the planet
review/text: I was first introduced to Wasa Sesame Crispbread in Sweden last year, and when I came home to the US  found them online and ordered a case. My wife has Croan's disease and has a hard time eating  any bread products and is able to have these with no ill effects. This is not only my favorite bread now but also my wife's, and 1 year old granddaughters. These are excellent with meats, cheese and most every dip we have tried  . We have tried the other Wasa crackers and have found them to be just so-so. The Sesame crackers are always in demand and will keep ordering cases.

review/summary: WASA Sesame Crisp Bread
review/text: Wasa Crisp Bread is an ideal product that is low sodium and high fiber that satisfies most nutritional needs.  I buy it due to past cardiac problems.  I buy it from Amazon since the grocery stores don't always carry the full range of WASA products.  Amazons quick service and very competitive prices are always welcome.

review/summary: CAUTION: Contains Sucralose w/Artificial Sweetener Aftertaste!
review/text: As another reviewer stated already, this is not labeled 'low calorie' or 'low sugar' so I didn't expect it to contain artificial sweetener. I guess that's my fault for assuming, as this does contain sucralose and has a terrible, artificial sweetener aftertaste. I understand that this taste apparently doesn't bother a lot of people, but I absolutely can't stand it and will be returning this product. I feel that this should be disclosed on the package a bit more prominently than just listed on the ingredients (I bought at Meijer, not at Amazon, where I was able to look at the package before purchasing). I know, I know, I should've checked the ingredients. I wish I would've. I'm only writing this review as a warning to anyone else who may be considering the purchase, but like me, hates that fake sugar flavor (not to mention putting whatever chemicals they use for that stuff into their body).

I enjoy both my coffee & tea very sweet, but I actually don't need as much sugar for this chai tea.  I put in the same amount I normally do for tea, and it's extra sweet (but still great) so next time I know not to use as much sugar.<br /><br />I will definitely continue buying this one.

review/text: As someone who really enjoys a Chai Tea Latte from time to time, I was really excited when I saw this product and read some of the rave reviews! When I brewed the first one I was impressed right away by the presentation and aroma. However, when I took the first sip it was almost too sweet to drink. It tastes like liquid caramel with a hint of spice. Personally I prefer my Chai with more spice and not much sweet, so this was not what I was looking for. If you do like sweet drinks, though, everything else about this was 5 star. So, I guess it depends on preference. Wish I had ordered this in a sampler because I don't think I'll be able to finish them all.

review/summary: Not a bad chai latte but expensive
review/text: If I could I'd give it 3.5 stars.<br /><br />The flavor isn't terrible. Not as good as a real chai latte of course but it has decent chai flavor and is relatively creamy. I do wish it was a bit spicier though (could probably mix this with real chai tea). Not bad calorie wise compared to other brands of chai latte powders because it uses artificial sweetener over real sugar. I don't mind but I know some people aren't fans of artificial sweetener.<br /><br />The only major hit this gets is that the price is really expensive. Each cup costs quite a bit more than regular k-cups but of course k-cups were never really for price conscious individuals. Definitely would not buy a keurig just for these since there's readily available chai latte powders that are just as quick to make at a much cheaper price.

They taste great. I will definitely order again. They came on time when promised. You cannot do better that that anywhere, ever!

review/text: I have to say this is the most amazing taste I have ever had.  I searched everywhere for this.  The few stores in our town that carries these are always out of stock of this flavor.  It normally sells out the first day they get the shipment it.... Most I have to resort to buying my supply online here.  This stuff has everything in it and no need to add more the flavor is just perfect.

review/summary: Really Good Chai Latte
review/text: If you like Chai Latte tea and don't want to fuss with making it the 'old Fashion" way, this is a good alternative.  Of course, you have to own a K-Cup coffee machine.  I've bought a few of these boxes of 24 k-cups.  The last time I ordered them they came in a package of 2 boxes (48 total) for about $32.  Now it looks like amazon is selling them as 1 box (24 k-cups) for about $18.  To me the key to buying this (or almost any item) on amazon is to do a search first.  There are many different sellers here and they all seem to have different prices and a different number of k-cups in their boxes.  Some add shipping and some have free shipping.<br /><br />As far as the tea goes, I really like it and would highly recommend it!

review/text: I bought these chai latte cups because I love Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts versions, but BE WARNED just adding water seems to intensify the artifical taste. While this seems redundant ADD MILK! It say latte, but there is something off with the ingredients so I do half water and the other half vanilla soy milk! It tastes great!! I can't digest lactose so I haven't tried cow milk, but Soy Milk does wonders! Don't throw your kcups away just yet. Also, you don't even need a keurig for these cups, alll the powder dissolves in hot water so no straining of grinds is necessary, so I mastered the half hot water half soy milk combo by just opening the foil pouring it all in then filling the cup (probably about 12-16 oz cup) half with hot water then half with soy milk.

review/summary: Lobster Chowders
review/text: I wish more people would spend time writing feedback on the food items on Amazon. Since they don't, I tried both Bar Harbor and Atlantic Lobster Chowders. The Bar Harbor is pretty decent for a canned soup, but I would recommend the Atlantic when it becomes available. I diluted both brands with cream to get a pleasant consistency. The Atlantic turned out to have better mouth feel and flavors. For some reason the Bar Harbor tasted more starchy like the potato had dispersed into the soup base. I wish it were otherwise but both brands despite their prices required a magnifying glass to find the lobster meat.

review/summary: High price and lack of directions hurt value
review/text: Bar Harbor's New England Lobster Chowder is a condensed chowder with big chunks of potatoes and, if you look closely, bits of lobster.  Now, I honestly did not expect a full lb of lobster meat in the can but I was a little surprised when I emptied the contents into my pot.  Still, the chowder tasted very good.  It's not nearly as good as homemade lobster chowder but it was better than a bowl of Campbell's New England Clam Chowder and served as a very adequate quick meal.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed at the vagueness of the directions.  For $6/can they could have been more specific than add milk, butter, or cream to desired consistency.  I found a bit of butter, splash of sherry, 1/4 cup of 2% milk, and 2 tbsp of cream worked very well.  Also, it was better than the Campbell's but I don't know if it was necessarily six times the price better.<br /><br />It's definitely worth while to keep in the house for a quiet night when you're looking to make a quick but tasty meal.

review/summary: one or three stars?  Puhlease.  It's a "canned" chowder for Pete's sake
review/text: I love seafood.  And seafood chowders.  The best are homemade.  Then some restaurants none of which do too badly.<br />And then there is canned.  Frankly, Boudin's Bakery makes a clam chowder to die for.  Now to Bar Harbor.  My first can had about 25% lobster meat.  Mostly claw from the looks of it.  Very sweet and "lobstery".  Then about the same amount of potatoes and veg.  In a broth that tastes beautifully of lobster.  I made mine on the stove. Perhaps that other reviewer used their microwave.  And I added one half cup of 2% milk and 3 Tablespoons of cream.  Absolute heaven.  As this brand uses tapioca as a thickening agent, and tapioca is uppety, I heated this slowly in a heavy Caphalon pan until very, very hot and stirred it nearly constantly.  Just like one would make tapioca.  I think if you follow those directions, you'll be surprised at how delicious this is.  Is it homemade.  No of course not.  Is it restaurant fare.  No way.  But for a quick chowder if you take some time to prepare it properly, it is absolutely delicious.  In a jam I would add extra cream, a dash of cream sherry, some fresh Italian parsley and serve this as a soup course for guests.  It is truly that good.  So buy some and enjoy it.  I certainly did just awhile ago.

review/summary: Love The Syrups, Not The Packaging
review/text: I love Torani Syrup and these flavors are great! Made with cane sugar, not corn syrup, which is a huge plus. Taste great in hot chocolate, herbal tea and steamed milk. Great for Italian sodas too.<br /><br />However, the product description says absolutely nothing about the fact that these bottles are plastic and not glass bottles that Torani Syrup is usually packaged in. The plastic bottles don't have as long of a shelf life (2 years compared to 3 years for the glass bottles). The plastic that they are made with (PET) has not been proven to be safe. I don't like the idea of chemicals (antimony and phthalates) leaking into the syrup over a long period of time because it's going to take a while to use up all of the syrup. I can't return these because they are a grocery item.

review/summary: Some flavors great, some not so great
review/text: This is great syrup. I bought them for Italian soda. Hazelnut and Caramel are terrible for this purpose (and peppermint is tolerable, but not great), but French vanilla, raspberry, and vanilla are wonderful. I'd recommend getting just the trio bottles of raspberry and french vanilla.

review/summary: Great product at a great price!
review/text: My husband uses all of these favors in his coffee drinks; it is hard to pick a favorite because they all taste so rich and flavorful. They are in plastic bottles, wrapped up nice and sent quickly. My husband scoffed when I originally bought this pack, but once it arrived (the next day, love amazon!) He thought I was a genius! With two vanillas (regular and French) hazelnut, peppermint, caramel, and raspberry it's a great selection for a great price. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Would love it more without the Raspberry
review/text: I signed up to get the variety pack every 6 months, which works out perfectly for me.  Just be aware that these will come in plastic bottles rather than the nice glass bottles, hence the lower price.  The one thing I would change would be the Raspberry, it's the only oddball flavor that doesn't go with this package.

review/text: For the price, this is totally worth it. All the flavors are great except for the hazelnut(in my opinion). Peppermint is my number one favorite. It may seem odd that there is a raspberry flavor however torani doesn't just make coffee syrups. The fruity flavors can be used for smoothies or italian sodas!

review/summary: Good and Bad
review/text: Some of the flavors are great. most are decent, one is absolutely awful (Peppermint), and one is awful for coffee (it even coagulates in hot coffee) but instead makes a wonderful ice cream topping (Raspberry ... yes that is spelled right).<br /><br />I bought this as a set at a good price and it was nice to try all the flavors, but I soon found that I tired of them. So while I would recommend having them around for parties if you invite a lot of coffee drinkers, the fact that you get such a great variety of good to bad makes me recommend buying separate bottles rather than the sets unless you get a great deal.

review/summary: Amazing deal
review/text: This variety pack is an amazing deal, because six bottles cost what two bottles cost in stores. You only get what they picked, and they're in plastic bottles rather than glass, but for my family that's a fine trade-off for getting a great deal. My family enjoys all of the flavors, and I'd rather have plastic than glass given the age of my kids.<br /><br />The flavors are:<br />- Hazelnut (very nice in coffee)<br />- Caramel (ditto)<br />- French Vanilla<br />- Vanilla<br />- Raspberry (great in seltzer)<br /><br />Ky kids swear that 2 parts caramel to 1 part french vanilla tastes just like the Butter Beer at Harry Potter at Universal Studios.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of - Toroni also sells a pack of the pumps (also a great price <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GSK4CW">Torani 750 ML Syrup Pump (Pack of 5)</a>) that go into the bottles, but it's a five pack of pumps, and there are six bottles in this pack, so the numbers don't quite line up, which means that you can't (cheaply) have all six bottles available for use at one time. But that's pretty minor - we just left the vanilla closed until we finish the french vanilla.

review/summary: Torani Variety Pack from Amazon
review/text: I was delighted to find the 25.4 oz bottles of Torani which were not available in our area. The price was the same for the smaller size I had been purchasing locally. However, when they arrived I was dismayed to find the amount of calories--I thought all flavors were zero calories as that was the only kind I knew. It seems I just happened to pick up four sugar-free bottles locally without knowing there was any other kind. I almost returned the shipment of high calorie bottles for that reason but it would have been too much trouble packing them up. I'm hoping this seller also has zero calorie Torani. If so I would purchase from online again.

review/summary: Just what it says on the package
review/text: The package arrived in good time, undamaged. I split the order with a friend, so I didn't get to taste all the flavors. My family is enjoying the French vanilla, the caramel and the hazelnut - all flavors I'd buy again. I got to try a bit of the raspberry. Not bad, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get it again. I've had the regular vanilla before, and liked it.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed that the syrups came in plastic bottles. The product description states, "The iconic Torani glass bottles are 100% recyclable and made with a minimum of 40% recycled content." It does not make clear that these bottles are not glass. I can get along with the plastic, but I think that should be made clearer.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'd order this particular assortment again, or individual bottles of specific flavors. I'll definitely continue using Torani syrups.

As a person that can not tolerate, Gluten, corn in any form, soy, any form of emulsifier, or food color, I have to be carefull. I tried this and it really improved the texture of the bread I baked. My family is happy with it, The only reservation I have is that I was a little dizzy the day after I ate it so I will wait a week and test it again. I really hope I am NOT sensitive to this as non gluten bread is not so good with out it. I will continue to use it for the family as every one else have had good results from it.

review/text: I was looking for a selection of k-cups but having commitment issues. I just couldn't bring myself to commit to buy 24 cups of Vanilla Creme or Toffee or a certain decaf blend, without actually knowing what it tasted like. And the pre-packaged mixed selections already had half the flavors I wasn't interested in. This is an ingenious idea! I just ordered a wide selection of exactly what I wanted to taste. Ordered it Saturday, the seller emailed me back within two hours of receiving my order email, and mailed it out Monday morning. Package received Wednesday. Great service, all the flavors I want to try. Can't recommend this enough to folks!

review/summary: Serviceable pizza crust
review/text: Every now and then, we like to make our own pizza. However, one problem: we don't want to make pizza dough from scratch! Problem solution? Boboli pizza crust or Rustic Crust pizza crust. We like the Rustic Crust pizza because it is organic, it uses whole wheat flour, and the package claims that it is a source of Omega-3s.<br /><br />Simple to make. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Brush the top of the crust with olive oil and then add whatever toppings you want (we have begun to, sometimes, use tofu to replace meats and still provide a protein source). Lower oven to 425 degrees and then cook for eight to twelve minutes.<br /><br />While this is not as good as freshly made pizza dough, it is serviceable and easy to use--and still provides a nice base for a pizza centered meal.
