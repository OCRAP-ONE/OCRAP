review/text: This came packed cold. It took longer then I thought it would (over a week). It also did not come packaged as the picture shows but rather came in an unmarked plastic. I am not sure if it the name brand it says it is because there was no marked packaging. I was not sure on how to cook it and there where no instructions. And, there was no expiration dates. Speculation on pork products is not a best practice. I divided this, inspected it, smelled it, and promptly froze it just to be safe. The product tastes great.

review/summary: pork back bacon
review/text: This is beautiful meat which was professionally sliced and packaged in cry-o-vac.  It was inside a foil pouch within the delivery box & dry ice had been included.  The meat was still cool & was sent by 2nd day air.  We had enjoyed this type bacon on a few occasions in Europe.  My first attempt at cooking it, it turned out just a bit dry.  I researched on-line and it suggested cooking it with a bit of olive oil.  It was perfect with that attempt.  The meat is mostly lean and as a cross between ham & bacon, it is definitely more like ham.  It has just the right amount of salt in it and I'm looking forward to many great meals as well as sharing some with family & friends.

review/summary: Excellent taste, amazing price.
review/text: I love this brand and type of caviar. It was of a higher quality than other black lumpfish caviar that I have had in the past. The flavor is amazing, so is the texture, and the size of the eggs is perfect for me, not too small and not too large, just right. Keep in mind, you do need to like it on the salty and fishy side. You cannot beat the price. I eat it every day for breakfast on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and a caviar moat. It is quite nice. Keep in mind you do need to like your caviar on the salty and fishy side, if not, then black whitefish is much more mild.

review/text: Eh, this was just ok.  I've had some comparably priced caviars that I liked much more.  The eggs are a little too large for my liking, and there wasn't enough 'snap'.  That's just my personal preference though.  The main thing is that there was just SO MUCH DYE.  Just a spoonful or two will turn your mouth (and skin if it touches it) blue.  I couldn't even get the blue off my finger after scrubbing.

review/text: I can't speak for ordering them through Amazon, but having bought these in Hawaii, this is, by far, the best snack food I've ever eaten.  No only do you have the outer layer of chocolate, and a layer of coconut, but there is also a layer of white chocolate, before you get to the salty macadamia nut in the middle.  Everyone I've ever shared these with has loved them.  I can definitely believe the stories about shipping problems, as I've had melting happen with ones I brought home, but for taste, this is the absolute best!

review/summary: Extremely Disappointed
review/text: If I could have given less than 1 star I would have. The candy is bone dry and rock hard. It's grainy not smooth with white stuff in the middle. There is no breaking pieces off this or biting it, you need a hammer or chisel. The sell by date is July 20, so it should have been ok. Which makes believe the sell buy date is bogus. I just spent $85 for 24 ounces that isn't even fit for maple sugar. I've contacted the company, and I'm waiting to hear back from them. I don't know if I got a defective batch, but these are a supreme disappointment. I like the idea of no additives, but what good is that if it's not edible? Someone else posted "melt in your mouth", when I put it in my mouth, it doesn't dissolve and if I suck on it, it's so hard it leaves cuts in my mouth.<br /><br />ABC Wholesale did get back to me. They do not honor the products they sell. They told me to contact the manufacturer. I am now waiting to hear back from the manufacturer. ABC Wholesale sent me another email stating they are not responsible for any quality issue of the candy and that the normal texture of the candy is hard and dry. They were very rude.<br /><br />I got an email from the manufacturer. The product is not supposed to be hard and dry. They told me they do not sell to ABC Wholesale and are not sure where they get their product so cannot guarantee it's freshness if you buy from them. I checked the link on Coombs Family Farm to buy the candy and ABC Wholesale is what comes up. So the person giving me information from the manufacturer obviously doesn't even know who they sell to. They also told me they would send me a replacement package. It's been two weeks and I haven't received anything from them.<br /><br />ABC Wholesale and Coombs Family Farm are selling an inferior product with extremely low quality and zero customer service.<br /><br />I have bought maple sugar candy from 2 other sources here on amazon. Sweet Vermont - which was good - firm and melt in your mouth. And Manfield Maple - which was even better - glazed/crisped on the outside and creamy on the inside. Mansfield also has no additives. They are less than half the price of Coombs Family Farm. They each only took two days to deliver the product to me.

review/text: If you were to give me an orange, it had better be a blood orange. I can tolerate orange juice every so often, and other than that, I don't care for orange candies. I'll eat them, but they'll be last.<br /><br />This matcha does not apply to these usual feelings of mine. This is an orange flavor I can stand. It's somewhere between a fresh orange and an orange candy. I can drink it no problem...especially because it mixes with other flavors so well.<br /><br />If you're adventurous, this one is a beauty with cola matcha. This is a fantastic addition to a smoothie, especially if you just need a little citrus tanginess to it. It's almost like being able to add a touch of orange juice but without adding more sugar and instead adding a little bit of a different dimension of flavor to your smoothie.<br /><br />Of course, if you dig orange flavors, this is probably a winner no matter what.

review/summary: Outstanding Orange Matcha
review/text: My Matcha journey continues with Red Leaf Tea"s Orange Matcha. Orange is one of my favorite fruit flavors. If you are a fan of the flavor orange as well, I highly recommend that you treat yourself. Perhaps even if orange isn't on your top 5 favorite flavors list, you may want to travel outside your flavor "comfort zone" and give this one a try. It certainly does not disappoint! The aroma is intoxicating and the flavor is straight up orangey goodness! I prefer this one cold but that may just be because it has been so hot lately. I prepare it according to directions, add a wee bit of simple syrup and chill. It is a refreshing citrus energy drink that is loaded with flavor and all the benefits of Matcha tea. I can not say enough about the energy drinking a cup of this tea provides. A great way to start your day or an excellent midday pick me up!<br />So many ways to incorporate this magic matcha into your day. Perhaps add to your orange cranberry muffin or scone recipe. One of my favorites so far has been to add a teaspoon of my orange matcha, a scoop of vanilla low fat frozen yogurt, a splash of low fat milk and a quick mix in the blender = a yummy wonderful dessert-like creamsicle flavored smoothie!

review/summary: Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
review/text: This blend is one I worry about, which is why it jumped in and out of the cart so many times when the new matchas were first released. I love oranges, but I'm very specific about. If it doesn't taste like fresh oranges, then why bother? For years, until just recently, in fact, I thought orange candies, like orange Skittles or Runts, were put in because they were cheaper to produce because nobody really liked them. Everybody knows that grape and strawberry are the good flavors, right? Wrong. This is what comes from a skewed worldview, folks. But it works out beautifully, because I love the strawberry and grape flavors of the world, and my wife loves the orange, lime, and lemons. So what that long story was winding up to was that if this matcha tastes more like candy orange and not fresh orange, I will be very, very sad. And then I'll mix it with the French Vanilla and everything will be just fine. And, of course, cranberry is one I must try mixed with the orange at some point. I also have a history of citrus matcha not turning out as good as I'd like (I'm looking at you, Lemon and Peach), but there  is a history of my being afraid of blends and having them turn out amazing (That's Watermelon and Earl Grey) as well. So I'm just trying to keep an open mind!<br /><br />I'm sitting here with three little cups of matcha to try (Orange, Apple, and Brandy) and I reached for Orange first. I took a sip, chuckled, and handed it to my wife. She doesn't like matcha, but she likes this one! I knew she would because that first sip is tasty, tasty orange candy. It's incredibly tasty (as you might have guessed) but it isn't really fresh orange or orange juice. It's orange Runts and juicy orange Skittles. Yum. My wife likes it, so I think this might become a morning treat for her, but for me...well, I don't know! But if I want oranges in the morning, I'll likely reach for orange juice proper. I have cotton candy matcha, also from Red Leaf Teas, what other matchas do I need? Still, I keep reaching for it as I sit here writing, so maybe it'll grow on me. It is very good, and if you're a fan of orange candy, this is one you must try. Not a touch of bitterness, though!

review/text: If you have ever consulted a veterinary allergist, you know you've arrived at that funny state of affairs which means that you've read the ingredients list in many other dog foods, and you are willing to buy the best thing you can to stop the dog's misery and the hemorrhage in your wallet.<br /><br />I started off with a border collie with middling food allergies and I tried a number of different novel protein foods to arrive at a lamb based kibble that worked. Then I got a pound rescued shetland sheepdog who had crippling food allergies - he frequently tore bits of the pads off his own toes fussing at the itch between them. A vet pinpointed the food as the problem. He said finding a 'novel' (unusual) protein did it for the border collie, but the sheltie was allergic to other dog food ingredients too. I now had to find a food that worked for both of them.<br /><br />We had another month of ingredient research and taste testing to arrive at Natural Balance. A novel protein like duck or lamb coupled with a grain free formula did the trick. Natural balance has both, and both dogs thrived on it. I had a third dog who lacked allergies of any sort, who just liked it anyway.<br /><br />Is it the "best" dog food on the market? A hard call - there are pluses and minuses to just about any food option available, including raw meat diets. For the 10 years he's been on this food, my elderly border collie has had a shining black coat, the teeth of a four year old, and no more intestinal upsets.  I would need a very compelling reason to look elsewhere for a better food.

review/summary: No gas from my Boston Terriers
review/text: Boston Terriers are notorious for their gas and mine are no different.  I've fed them many different foods and this is the one food that doesn't give them gas.  It is wonderful and also limits their food allergies.  Even though it is expensive, it is quite worth not having to put up with the room clearing gas attacks.

review/summary: Great For Dogs With Possible Food Allergies
review/text: I have a 2 year old Yellow Labrador that has been battling an allergy for the past few months. We were told to try this food as a way of eliminating unnecessary ingredients to see if the allergy was indeed food based. First off, contrary to her breed characteristics, my lab is a picky eater. She usually leaves the dry food sitting until we mix in some wet food, or until she's really hungry. That all changed with this bag, she sits as we pour it and eats the dry food almost immediately. Score one for the brand. Her allergy seems to have gone away, now that could very well mean she has a seasonal allergy, but could indeed also suggest it was food based. Either way, I'm very happy with the quality of the food and my lab's readiness to eat it. I'll be sticking to Natural Balance LID bags for the forseeable future.

review/text: Our Lab loves this stuff! She has a very sensitive stomach so we have to be very careful with what food we feed her. She's been on this food for months now and have had no problem! Her coat is glossier and softer than ever before, too!<br /><br />We've also noticed it doesn't have the same foul smell that a lot of the big brands do, most likely due to the natural ingredients.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!

review/summary: Happy Tails
review/text: We have an Irish Setter with grain allergies and a Border Collie with a very sensitive stomach.  They don't respond well to being fed separately, so we had to find a food that would work for both pets.  This was the one.  They absolutely love it and will even beg for it as a treat.  Glad to find it on Amazon.

review/summary: Too Good To be Called Ramen
review/text: I stumbled across the "The Ramen Rater" blog and became very curious to experience what a raman fanatic considered to be The Best. Indomie Mie occupied the top two on his 10 favorites list. I thought it would just be a whacky expenditure and decided to try this flavor. Fantastic! If I were served this is a restaurant, I'd have been happy to pay for it. It is THAT good. Just the right amount of medium heat and lots of flavor. These are hard to make on a 15 minute work break though! By the time I squeeze out all the tight spice packets and get the boiling water over it, I have to be back at my desk! The 30 ramen come in a nice compact box. Excellent packaging. Totally worth the shipping cost. I am definitely ordering more.

review/summary: Very Asia 30 pack
review/text: I searched around for a legit place that sells this wonderful meal! I love these noodles and will NEVER go back to Ramen or any other version of instant noodles for that matter.  With less calories, less sodium, and less fat content than Ramen/other brands, for a meal that is quick and affordable, Indomie is the way to go! Especially the Mi Goreng Pedas (Spicy noodles) it has a little kick to it! But not too spicy though, and you could always not add the chili powder to your noodles, which is what I do if I don't want the spice. It still tastes delicious either way.<br /><br />Very Asia took a bit to ship my package (maybe because I was too eager to get my hands on it after so long) but it was WELL WORTH THE MONEY.  This is the MOST affordable place online, that I have found, to buy this product; unless you find a good Asian Market store in you local city. My closest one is an hour away so I'd rather have it shipped to my door step! @ .65 cents a package after calculated shipping, I'll take it! You will not be disappointed in Very Asia or Indomie.<br /><br />The package came in the original Indomie box, (i.e. the Indomie box was not put into another box to keep from getting damaged as a precaution) however, it didn't seem to do harm to the contents inside. When I opened the box, there was bubble wrap and my invoice, and my beloved noodles. Yes you can say I'm addicted. lol Hope this helps! If you are worried about trying something new, I highly encourage you to GO FOR IT. You won't regret this purchase.

review/summary: Fast solution for a student on the rush
review/text: I found this product to be very useful when in college. Not only is it delicious, but also takes little time and effort in its preparation and serving. The individual packages contain the instructions on how to prepare the product, but I developed an alternative way; instead of adding the spices and sauce to the noodles after removing it from the boiling water, I just add everything into the boiling water, mix and let the water boil until the noodles are soft and there is a small amount of the (now) spicy water left (you may even let the water boil out but make sure you don't let the noodles burn), then just empty the pan onto a plate and eat! Total time taken: 5-10 minutes (depending on how fast your stove heats water).<br /><br />Note: If you use this method, you may want to add just enough water to immerse the noodles since you will not be able to separate the noodles from the water without loosing some of the flavor; I usually tend to place just enough water to immerse only half of the noodles and then flip it over when the immersed side has softened.

review/summary: Smooth in the decaffeinated version
review/text: I can't comment on the regular, but I just bought a can of this at a local Italian grocery store in the decaffeinated and it is absolutely smooth, did not at all taste burned or bitter. It's better than any other decaf coffee in the grocery store aisle that I have tried. I picked it up because my employer brought back some coffee from Italy that was heavenly a couple of years ago but that is not available stateside. This was not quite the same, but again, was still better than anything else I've tasted from the grocery store!

review/summary: Best value for canned crabmeat offered by Amazon.com
review/text: My comments are intended for experienced canned crabmeat eaters.  People who suddenly try their first can of canned crabmeat are typically so disappointed that the contents aren't as good as the Alaskan King Crab they once ate.<br />ADVANTAGES:  (1)The price is not excessive.  Priced at less than $2.50 per 6-ounce can and provided with very fast, free shipping.  (2)The quantity of crabmeat is good.  The crabmeat doesn't sink to the halfway point of the can after the water is drained away.  (3)The quality of the crabmeat is good.  Product of Indonesia.  Pure white meat only.  (4)It's convenient to open the can with a can opener, drain the water, and throw away the paper at the top of the can.  Unlike Chicken of the Sea brand Fancy Crab 6-ounce cans (product of Vietnam), which has both red and white crabmeat and the paper at the bottom of the can clings to the crabmeat making it inconvenient to eat all of the contents, this Bumble Bee Crabmeat product has the paper at the top of the can and it does not cling to the crabmeat below so it's quite convenient to just throw away the paper.  DISADVANTAGES:  (1)If you like red crabmeat mixed in, you won't get any.  Some people don't enjoy eating pure white crabmeat as much as red crabmeat.  (2)You won't get the high-quality chunks of crabmeat found in much more expensive canned crabmeat products.  The quality of the pure white crabmeat in this Bumble Bee product is good when compared against other non-chunk crabmeat products but is not as high in quality as natural chunks of crabmeat.

review/summary: Buyers beware! This is not HARISSA!!!!
review/text: What a disappointment! BUYERS BEWARE!!!!<br /><br />I just got this product and it's definitely not HARISSA!<br /><br />I am Moroccan, born and raised and I know a thing or two about Moroccan food.<br /><br />HARISSA is a Tunisian hot chili sauce commonly eaten in North Africa.<br />Main ingredients are bird's eye chili peppers, Serrano peppers and other hot peppers , garlic, olive oil and SPICES such as coriander, cumin or caraway.<br />HARISSA is a very popular and standard condiment of North African cuisine (mostly Algeria and Tunisia) and only recently made inroads into Morocco according to Morocco food expert Paula Wolfert.<br /><br />Moroccan cuisine has been subject to Berber, Moorish, Mediterranean, and Arab influences and a wide variety of SPICES  are used by Moroccans to create delicious dishes.<br /><br />Here are the most important spices you will frequently encounter in Moroccan cooking:<br /><br />- karfa (cinnamon)<br /><br />- kamoun (cumin)<br /><br />- kharkoum (turmeric)<br /><br />- skinjbir (ginger)<br /><br />- libzar (pepper)<br /><br />- tahmira (paprika)<br /><br />- anise seeds<br /><br />- sesame seeds<br /><br />- qesbour (coriander)<br /><br />- zaafran beldi (saffron)<br /><br />- ras el hanout<br /><br />That said,  WHAT MAKES THIS HOT PEPPER SAUCE MOROCCAN? WHAT MAKES IT TRADITIONAL?<br /><br />Let's look at the ingredients list, shall we?<br /><br />`'Red Chili Pepper, Red Bell Pepper, Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Vinegar, Salt''.<br /><br />I don't see anything that says `'Moroccan'', do you?<br /><br />And what about the `'traditional'' part?!!!<br />Very confusing and misleading.<br /><br /> I can't say that a lot of thought was put in the recipe.<br /><br />Dear fellow foodies and/or avid cooks, If you want to prepare foods with AUTHENTIC MOROCCAN flavors please do yourself a favor: look ELSEWHERE!<br /><br />This is a plain, ordinary hot pepper sauce. And not that cheap.<br /><br />Shame on this company for selling this hot pepper sauce under the name Harissa. Shame shame shame.

review/summary: spice and flavor to my diet
review/text: I originally bought this for my husband who loves spicy foods. We had an amazing dinner party at the house where I mixed sauce in the white rice with some grilled Kebabs, this small addition made the food so authentic. Mixing it with the rice made me think of my diet and how bland my food has been this spring and alas i discovered a way to spice up my egg whites and make an actual dinner style dish out of this. It was so amazing and really made loosing weight so easy. I started to utilize this spice and it eliminated my cravings. I sauteed carrots then mixed some in, even used it as a dipping sauce for a eggplant that ended tasting like a gourmet infused far eastern salad...This sauce has really saved me from cheating on my diet. It works with everything!!!

review/summary: A transforming experience ..
review/text: The first time I tasted Harissa, I was in Northern Africa on business dining at local restaurants. Once de-virginized to the savory topping , I fell in love with this flavorful, zesty sauce. Years later I happened to attend a friends home for a dinner and on the table was a bottle of Mina's delicious Harissa sauce. Upon tasting this exotic delicacy , I was transformed back to Morocco savoring every bite. Since then, I've tried many different Harissa sauces, even a good friend of mine who happens to be a native of Morocco , claims her Harissa sauce is the best , However ,upon tasting Mina's Harissa she grudgingly had to admit that her Harissa does not compare to Mina's mouth watering, colorful blend of unique  ingredients. Nowadays, Mina's Harissa is a staple in my kitchen and I use it as a flavor booster, helping me expand my palate in most of my cooking, I also use it  as a topping on most of my sandwich's.Thank you Mina for sharing you secret recipe with the rest of the world and  giving us a taste of Heaven in every bottle..

review/summary: The Future of Hot Sauce
review/text: I bought this in NYC when I saw it after reading about how Harissa is an upcoming thing in the food world. I can't believe how simple it is(and all natural) with the flavor it packs. Excellent as a dip too. I can say is I've found my Tabasco replacement!

review/summary: I am in LOVE with this sauce.  Best addition to eggs I've ever had.
review/text: I came across this Mina Harissa spicy sauce by chance.  It absolutely knocked my socks off, and I am in love.<br />My first time at it, I started off pretty conservatively with scrambled eggs.  After the first bite, I have since<br />fallen TOTALLY in love with this sauce, I put loads of it on and cover every square inch of my plate, and I refuse to make scrambled eggs unless I have this sauce...<br />no joke, buy this sauce, and you will experience happiness.  That is, until you run out ;)  If you dig hot sauce, you should probably buy two or so right off the bat.<br /><br />Once you try this sauce, you will be hooked.  Gauranteed.

review/summary: Not bad, but NOT HARISSA
review/text: I am giving this product a 1-star review not becuase it tastes bad, but because it is not what it claims to be.  Harissa is a north-African condiment comprised primarily of chile peppers.  This product claims it can be used as a dip and is comprised primary of red bell peppers. (Of the seven ingredients listed, chile peppers are next to last.  No traditional Moroccan spices, such as cumin, are present in this product)<br /><br />To put it in American terms, this is equivalent to purchasing a product called "Traditional American ketchup", only to discover that it is made out of red peppers instead of tomatoes.<br /><br />Again, I am not saying that this is a bad-tasting product - you might enjoy it.  My complaint is the claim that it's a "Traditional Moroccan" condiment.  As other reviewers suggest, a product like Mustafa's harissa is closer to the real deal.

review/summary: Bogus Harissa,  a poser
review/text: This is nothing like the real thing ! I am unable to understand why the amount of positive reviews .<br />I bought this since I was unable to find Mustaphas in Wegmans supermarket here in NY.<br />To buy Mustaphas online is expensive !! product price not so bad, but when  the shipping is added it is quite pricey ( but well worth every cent)<br />please trust me on this it is worth it ! I buy mine in the pack of three saves a bit and I use them quickly , However if you really enjoy Mina and are 5 star happy with it great !! I am happy for you.<br />But I can say this with complete honesty once you have tried Mustaphas I doubt you will ever want to buy any other . So How do I describe how wonderful a product Mustaphas Moccican Harissa is ?and how the two compare ( they are so different )<br />Mina is thin weak almost tasting like it came from a can .<br />Mustaphas is thick almost as thick as tomato paste with a beautiful deep rich flavor and color which is beautiful, the heat is wonderful, ( you must be able to enjoy the heat) but it is not just raw heat, it is flavor a depth of flavor that almost allows you to picture Mustaphas being made in small homemade batches by artisans who know the taste they are crafting  the flavor will transport you ( no magic carpet required ) and you will find so many uses for it .again the flavor is rich sumptuous the level of heat can be adjusted by the amount you use it takes very little to enjoy the rich flavor and it melds with everything but it is hot .<br />I could not find anything that I could use Mina on, I tried, it was 9.00 for the jar and I felt I must try top like it but in the end I yet threw away a nearly full jar of Mina in a household where even the youngest grandchildren love hot sauces and Harissa ( in small amounts )<br />no one at all liked the Mina product !! My fridge has many bottles of hot sauces, We go through so many, a big favorite is Marie Sharps one of the most flavorful hot sauces We have ever had discovered it years ago when in Belize. I say this so that I might offer you a reference point of my personal taste .I do not mean to compare them as similar products, both are quite different except for astounding flavor, uniqueness, and quality .I hope that this review helps ( and that you will forgive the gramatical errors ).Please check out Mustaphas available on the Amazon site the jar does not show the name in a pronounced way the print that shows the name of the brand is small the words Morrican Harissa might help identify or just do a search . but look for it, try it, do not judge Harissa by Mina !! there can be no comparison between the two .If you are happy with Mina so be it .but if it is the only one you have tried then try Mustaphas take a chance, just be ready to buy a lot of it since you will find so many uses for it, and you will miss it when you run out to be sure .Thanks for listening to sum it up ,I do not like the Mina product at all !! I will not belittle it anymore than I have .I would rather offer you positives and Mustaphas is that positive to be sure .Thanks again

review/summary: Good little coffee!
review/text: This is actually one of the few flavored coffees that I have found to taste like it should. It really does smell like a fresh baked apple strudel. The taste is not overpowering...the cinnamon & apple flavors are combined with a hint of vanilla. It's not incredibly strong, but you can taste it well and it makes for a nice dessert coffee. And will be perfect during those long winter months, with a few sugar cookies. :)<br />This is one that I WILL *subscribe & save* to.

review/summary: Sweet, healthy and just the right amount of tangy aftertaste
review/text: Sun Maid makes their Mediterranean Apricots to perfection. Tangy yet sweet, these dried apricots provide a rather healthy snack. As Amazon correctly notes, just 1.5 ounces of these beauties makes for a serving of fruit; and fruit is a critical component for a healthy diet.<br /><br />The canister is indeed recloseable and although they need no refrigeration you can certainly keep these in the fridge within their canister.<br /><br />Besides eating them straight out of the container, these apricots help to make a good fruit salad and they fit the bill for any recipe that requires apricots.<br /><br />The plusses don't end there. These apricots have no fat and no cholesterol; the amount of sodium they contain per serving is so low--15mg--that they have almost no salt. They provide potassium and dietary fiber as well. Each serving has only 100 calories so they are useful for persons who watch their weight.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, these dried apricots don't provide any meaningful amount of vitamins. Although Amazon states that they provide antioxidants, I see very little evidence of that on the nutrition label. Yes, a single serving has 10% of the daily recommended amount of vitamin A; but that's it in the antioxidants department--unless you choose to count the 2% of vitamin C that they offer. I have to take off one star for the discrepancy regarding antioxidants; that will make this a four star review.<br /><br />Overall, these Mediterranean Apricots by Sun Maid offer an excellent alternative to junk foods and candy. They make a healthy snack food and they are useful for recipes as well.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!

review/summary: Perfectly satisfied with these Apricots
review/text: I just received my Apricots, the expiration date will be Jan. 2010, so I can be sure they won't turn black before this date... if they even last this long! I had read the previous reviews and was a little worried about the quality/ size/ freshness etc.  I bought 12 cans, as I will be using most of them for baking, sports bars, pastes etc. Therefore, only the freshness counts, not the size. The prize of $4.40 per 15 oz container is reasonable (price of total shipment divided among the supply), it's still more economical than buying in bulk on other sites, or at the Supermarket.<br />Another reviewer commented about the lack of flavor. She might have had the sundried variety in mind, which is something different all together - and too pricey for my purposes. For casual snacking, etc. these Sunmaid Apricots are just fine...

review/summary: Bland and Mushy
review/text: I bought these because of the sale price and because of the fact that I really like the Sun Maid peaches.  I regret to say I am disappointed.  The taste of the fruit is bland; you really have to struggle to find any apricot flavor at all.  Worse, my sensitive tounge noticed sulfur overtones.  Furthermore, these apricots are not really dried; they are really soft and mushy.  You will notice right away if you are used to dried peaches or apples.  Finally, I thought that it was odd that in this day and age they did not come in a resealable container.<br /><br />These might have a use in adding color to a salad.  But overall I cannot  rate them highly.  I will probably eat them since I spent the money (they are not horrible) but I will not buy again.

review/text: God invented 4 perfect things:<br />1) Strawberries<br />2) Ice Cream<br />3) Apricots<br />4) Renee Olstead<br /><br />Having said that, these apricots are GOOD, but SUNSWEET is BETTER, and DEERFIELD (sold at Walgreen) also is better.  The most important thing about dried apricots is that they are not TOO dry.  Very important to refrigerate them after opening, best to fridge them even before, and you have to eat them within a reasonable time frame - they do not keep forever.  It really is potluck when you buy apricots whether you get a really superb batch or not, regardless of brand.  A lot of variables can affect their quality, it is similar to buying produce of any kind at the supermarket.  Sometimes you get a truly splendid banana, sometimes you don't.  You never know for certain until you eat it.  Overall, these are a good deal.

review/text: I have always wondered why "California" apricots are more expensive than the "Mediterranian" or "Turkish" variety.  I mean -- aren't imports supposed to be more expensive due to shipping costs?  Then I realized....  Different varieties of apricots can be planted anywhere!  So, maybe it isn't the shippnig costs that make Turkish / Mediterranian apricots less expensive, maybe it's just the rarity of the tree? (Bush? bulb? flower?  tree? seed?), and/or the care that must be taken to grow it, and bring it to eating quality, that counts for the expense.  And the California variety of apricots surely is more expensive than the Turkish /Mediterranian type.  The Turkish / Mediterranian dried apricots offered by Sunmaid, herein being reviewed, cost $14.34 for four cannisters of 15 ounces each.  By contrast, the California apricots, offered by the same company, cost $15.02, for four packages....OF 6 OUNCES EACH! Wow! Approximately 2 1/2 x the price!<br /><br />I'm sure I must have had California apricots at some time in my life.  Looking at the pictures of this more expensive variety, I recognize the curving "saucer" type shape, whereas the Mediterranian / Turkish variety I just bought and am now reveiwing, look more like little round throw-pillows.<br /><br />This less expensive variety is still tasty....and quite nutritious!  They are a nice change, especially, for people who take prunes for, er....medicinal purposes.  These apricots do almost as good a job, and taste different than prunes, too!<br /><br />They are also BURSTING with Vitamin C!  10% of vitamin C's daily requireent may not seem like a lot.  But that's for one serving, (11 servings are listed as being inside the 15 ounce container.)  But who eats just over an ounce of these delicious dried fruits, every time one sits down?  Not me, that's for sure.  At least a half-a-box at a time, as I eat them, will make your energy level SOAR. (For a few minutes, at least.)  No, they will NOT produce a "drug high"....but the Vitamin C in these apricots, (if you eat a half-cannister or more at a time), will definitely give your brain self-confidence.)<br /><br />All in all, a nice little dried apricot "bargain".  Try some today!  : ),

review/summary: Great Do-It-Yourself Curry
review/text: This curry is absolutely delicious and easy to make. I'm  a college student with two roommates, and this stuff made enough food for the three of us for every meal for about a week. My only problem is it tends not to be very spicy, but a couple of habanero peppers fixed that. Great to experiment with as far as adding ingredients. I recommend adding potatoes in addition to your choice of meat at the minimum. Absolutely great stuff, especially if you haven't made curry before. I cannot recommend this product enough.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I have eaten this curry for years, and find it quite tasty.<br /><br />The problem is that it always seems to disappear from my grocery store.<br /><br />Follow the directions and you will get Curry just like from your local Teriyaki house.<br /><br />MSG or not, it is great to have in the cupboard to whip up a tasty dinner (with days of leftovers).

review/summary: Delicious curry
review/text: I am a from scratch kind of gal. I love to cook, peruse cookbooks, make delicious food. But every once in a while a product comes along that is better than any recipe I've tried from scratch, and S&B Curry is one of those products. I add my own veggies, usually onion, carrot, celery, and chicken is our favorite meat, plus raisins because we like raisins in our curry. The minute I open the package I can start to smell that fabulous curry fragrance. The Sauce melts into the water and thickens, leaving a gorgeous curry coating over all the food, perfect over a bowl of fluffy rice. I like the hot, and it is hot, so tasty for the whole family.

review/summary: Way too many sunflower seeds
review/text: The quality is good, however, I think they skimped on the seeds.  Too many sunflower seeds make this cereal hard to get through, especially since the sunflower seeds tend to aggregate toward the bottom of the bowl.

review/summary: mmmmmmm
review/text: We discovered this cereal while in Europe. I sprinkle some of this muesli on top of my bowl of uncooked old fashioned oatmeal, add cold almond milk, stir it and eat it. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO COOK IT!!!! It is so delicious! Now I order it from Amazon. For vegetarians and vegans - it contains no animal products. Enjoy!
