review/summary: A little goes a long way
review/text: You will get a lot of cuttlefish ink in this container. If you use it often, you may see the value in the purchase. If you use it sparingly - maybe once a month like myself - it's a bottomless abyss of inky goodness.<br /><br />I've personally used it for making black pasta, using no more than a tablespoon at a time. As such, I'll probably only use about half the jar before it expires. That said, if you're planning on getting this to experiment, try finding  a smaller container, and certainly go for it. If you're going to use it full-time, such as in a buffet or restaurant setting, have at it!<br /><br />As per the quality of the ingredient and the taste, it's almost a non-issue: the taste is appropriately subtile!

review/summary: A celiac child's dream-no gluten
review/text: My son loves these.  He has no other choice and Glenny's is the only one who makes a plain/vanilla flavor.  He is not interested in the other choices Glenny's has or some of the other brands version of a rice krispie treat.  I have two questions however.....why is this never available on Amazon?  I can get any other flavor here, but not the blue box/plain flavor Glenny's.  The stores have them but charge so much!!  I have a 14 yr old who is eating me out of house and home right now and will take two/three at a time when going out the door.  My second question is when will Kellogs get off their rear ends and take the malt out of rice krispies so he can eat the regular version?  I think they do it on purpose so they don't have to address the gluten free issue!  Please Amazon get this flavor in stock!!!

review/summary: Decent flavor, but...
review/text: I got really excited when I saw these gelatin-free treats on the shelf at my local health food store. I was also impressed by the brown rice and relatively low sugar content in these bars, so I had to buy a pack. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed when I got home and tried one out. It had a good flavor, but seemed hard and stale. I opened another one later on and it was the same way. I checked the expiration date on the box and saw that they were still fresh, so I guess that's how they are supposed to be. I probably won't buy these again, which is unfortunate because they had seemed like such a great find.

review/summary: Play Dough Treats
review/text: I do not eat much junk food, and most of the marshmallow treats are usually laden with artificial preservatives and colors. Starbucks actually sells natural, non-corn syrup marshmallow rice treats "rice crispies" but they are expensive to buy and don't come in small packages. I tried these and it tasted more like puffed brown rice and brown rice syrup than a marshmallow treat. It also tasted very tasteless and smelled like play dough! It reminded me more of a snack bar than a marshmallow treat. They definitively need to add more marshmallows to the ingredients, and I will be returning the box I bought.

review/summary: Healthy and no gelatin, but smells and tastes bad
review/text: I gave this two stars vs one, because relatively speaking, it's healthy.....provided you can stand the odor and flavor enough to eat it.<br />I was so excited to find this product, because it didn't contain gelatin, had brown rice in it, and generally seemed much healthier than the standard "rice crispy"-type product.  I do eat A LOT of "health food" as a vegetarian of many years, and I realize that most healthy foods are inherently going to taste different than the typical processed junk most people eat these days.  I also don't eat a ton of sugar, and I feel I've grown more than accustomed to the taste of alternative ingredients.  This is why I'm so confused by why this particular product smelled and tasted terrible to me.  Every single ingredient in this product I'm positive I've had in other foods before.<br />I can only describe the odor as very similar to Play Dough....not the homemade stuff either, but the stuff in the colorful containers I played with as a kid.<br />The taste was ok at first, but then the "other" flavors emerged...and I had to spit it out and throw it away.  Maybe it was connected with the odor, I don't know.  I've heard that odor can affect you sense of taste.  I thought maybe I got a bad batch, so several months later I bought some more (at a different store), and I experienced the same unpleasant odor and taste.

review/summary: These weren't the Vegans I was hoping for
review/text: Assorted Vegans! For only $35? What a deal! I was quite looking forward to receiving my Assorted Box of Vegans, but when it arrived, I was woefully disappointed to find a box full of cookies. I was really hoping for a diverse group of Vegans with whom I could converse, and learn more about the Vegan lifestyle. You see, I tend to view Vegans pretty negatively--I can't stand their jeremiads about unethical treatment of animals, long-winded explanations about why honey is the product of animal abuse, and why pleather shoes are a legitimate fashion choice. I really wanted to get my assorted Vegans settled around a crackling fire so we could explore their philosophy and mine, and see if we couldn't reach some truce with each other. Sadly, this was not meant to be, and I was left with a poor substitute for authentic, chock-full-o-butter and eggs cookies.

review/summary: Ethical eating without compromise
review/text: I was sent a box of Uncle Eddie's by my young niece, a convert to veganism after a recent - and by all accounts, traumatic - school trip to the local abattoir.<br /><br />Not being of the vegan persuasion myself, I was unaccustomed to animal-free comestibles. The chewiness of the cookies was surprisingly pleasant, although they definitely lacked the flavour of their traditionally-made cookie cousins due to the absence of butter and other ethically-incorrect animal ingredients.<br /><br />Happily this minor disappointment was easily remedied by immersing the cookies in a shallow bath of warmed lard prior to ingestion. Personally, I prefer the fuller flavour of unrendered lard (obtained from the fatty deposits surrounding the pig's kidneys) but feel sure that the cheaper varieties made from the hard fat between the back skin and the flesh of the pig will suffice for people with less refined palates.<br /><br />By following my advice for post-production animal fat insertion, you can now guzzle guilt-free without compromising on the flavour.

review/summary: Works to reduce gas
review/text: Our son was having lots of problems with gas (we are breastfeeding and supplimenting) so we tried this formula.  It reduced the amount of gas he had (I was counting the crying mad sessions) -- or at least the amount that he would complain about.  It didn't eliminate it completely, although I really can't tell how much of that might be due to my wife's diet.<br /><br />Regardless, if you have a gassy baby, you may want to give this a try.<br /><br />It doesn't seem to dissolve as well as the 'regular' Enfamil, so you may want to use a knife or something to mash out any balls of Enfamil powder that form.  After doing that, it doesn't have any problems finishing dissolving.

So when I was told to try this at 1130 at night in the emergency room after he had a 4 hour gas filled screaming fit I was AMAZED...

Withing 4 feedings it was like a light went off, he was peaceful, eating well and sleeping so soundly. And has continued to do so over the last 4 days.

review/summary: Works for us well.
review/text: I was using organic Earth's Best formula. I mostly breastfeed but have to supplement some due to supply issues. Anyway my daughter gets about 6-8 oz. of formula a day and the rest is breastmilk. She is 5 weeks old now. She usually needs 1 or 2 ounces of formula after breastfeeding in the late morning and late evening hours only. When she drinks only breastmilk she was not having problems but after giving her the Earth's best formula she would scream for about an hour afterwards.<br />She also often had projectile spit-ups and would burp and fart-a lot.<br />So last week I switched to this Enfamil Gentlease, but I just bought a small can from the grocery store to try it. With the very first 2 oz. bottle we saw the change. For the first time after a bottle she was content and went in her swing happily cooing and looking around and fell asleep after about 10 minutes and took a nice long late morning nap.  It was great and this is all we will use now.<br />I am concerned that they do not offer this made with organic milk, I would rather have an organic milk to have less pesticides found in the cow's feed and no hormones or anitbiotics and I also do not really like that corn syrup solids is the #1 ingredient so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for these reasons, but this formula does work for her and she is now a happy,content baby girl and our home is peaceful again.

review/summary: There are better options
review/text: To be honest, I didn't want to like this formula. I was having gas and spit-up issues with Enfamil Newborn and our pediatrician recommended this for our 2 week old son. When I read the ingredients and saw that the first one is corn syrup, I balked and purchased a three pack of Baby's Only Organic from Amazon, hoping it would work for us. It made my baby terribly constipated. So I bought the Target brand Gentle formula which is supposed to be comparable to this. It is, but we were still getting spit ups. I switched to a mix of Enfamil Newborn and Enfamil AR. Back to horrible, screaming gas issues. Finally, reluctantly, I had to admit that of the four things we'd tried, this is the best for us. I bought the brand name because the Target brand smelled like malt mix and doesn't mix well. There is really no difference between Enfamil and Target other than the smell and color. Enfamil doesn't mix well either. Both give my son horrible green swamp poops which are runny and explosive. But apparently that's normal with the gentle formulas. Yuk.<br /><br />My son does better on this. I suspect he has lactose sensitivities and this, while not really cutting down on the gas, helps him to pass it and not scream in pain all day. He sleeps well and eats without pain. While I would like him to eat something that doesn't make his diapers so nasty, it's worth it. Plus, we use cloth diapers so the poop doesn't explode out of the diaper and onto his clothes. It does make for some very interesting diaper changes.<br /><br />I'm still not completely settled on this, but I have a two month supply so we are on it for now. I just wish I could find something that would agree with him without the gross diapers and less than ideal ingredients.<br /><br />Update:  I switched to Baby's Only LactoRelief and saw a HUGE improvement in reflux symptoms in just 1 feed!  His stools improved drastically and he is a new baby!  I have come to believe that it was not reflux at all.

review/summary: Worked...with some unexpected side-effects.
review/text: My little girl was having alot of gas with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VKR0EU">Enfamil Premium Infant Formula, For Babies 0-12 Months, 23.4-Ounce</a>, so my husband and I decided to change to this one. While it did reduce her gas, it caused her:<br /><br />1) intake to double the usual amount due to how thin the formula was, which caused her to wake up more often;<br />2) stools to become very firm or thick paste-like, making her horribly uncomfortable;<br />3) mealtimes to be more difficult because she did not like the bitter taste of this formula, causing her to take much longer than typical to finish.<br /><br />So, after 1.25 containers, I opted to change back to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VKR0EU">Enfamil Premium Infant Formula, For Babies 0-12 Months, 23.4-Ounce</a>. The change back made her significantly happier--both in mood and body. She sleeps longer due to feeling full, and her stools have returned to normal.<br /><br />This formula does work to reduce gas, but not all babies will take and stay on it.

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: Around 8 months old, my daughter started spitting up her regular formula, a lot.  We thought she might be reacting to all the foam created from shaking her bottles.  We bought this stuff to supplement with her regular formula, and even one scoop makes all the foam go away. I would imagine its because it is partially broken down which makes it easier for them to digest.  That was two months ago and we still supplement a small amount of this in each bottle for the de-foaming action.  I know they say to wait an hour after you make a bottle for it to settle, but really, who has time for that?

review/summary: Good Grief is this Expensive!
review/text: My second child was very much unlike his older brother in that he was extremely sensitive.  He had mild eczema for his first 4 months and he had difficulty keeping formula down and breast milk if he had just thrown up the formula.  Plus he was a very gassy baby.  He has outgrown all of these things.<br /><br />I say this because my son was given my pumped breast milk exclusively for the first six months and then I had a supply in the freezer for another month.  At the 7-month mark I needed to supplement with formula to make the milk last.  My pediatrician gave me a sample of Enfamil Gentlease due to my son's sensitive stomach.  My son hated it.  I can't blame him, it stinks.  He would stick his little nose in the air and turn his head.  It wasn't until I combined a bottle with the formula and the breast milk that he began to drink it and tolerate it quite well.  Before that, I tried him on one of the Similac ones and it left him terribly constipated, but he liked the taste of the formula.  So I had to go back to the Gentlease.  After a few weeks he tolerated the plain formula well.<br /><br />The other unfortunate thing about this formula is that it is so expensive.  One 22.2 oz container lasted about half a week.  I was buying this every week and, when I flaked on it I would have to pay extra at the grocery store.  It wasn't until the last month that he was on it that I realized AMAZON HAD A SUBSCRIBE & SAVE PLAN FOR A BOX OF THREE PACKETS OF THIS.  What money I could have saved?!  Oh well.  Live and learn.<br /><br />I would never tell anyone how to care for their child, but if you are in a situation like mine, you might try mixing the formula with breast milk (if you have that option) to see if your baby will tolerate the formula.<br /><br />I guess all babies are different because my first son was a dream.  I guess he inherited my stomach because you could put anything in it and he does just fine.  He was able to tolerate the less expensive Costco brand while my second was definitely unable.

review/summary: Worked after the very first feeding!
review/text: We just switched our 2 week old son to this formula at the recommendation of his doctor. We had a good experience with Gerber Good Start Protect with our first baby and had started our son on the Gerber when we came home from the hospital. At first he seemed fine, but after the first week, he would cry, grunt, and writhe around for 10 minutes after every feeding, had VERY smelly poops, and didn't want to be put down to sleep. After receiving a free sample of this from his doctor, we switched him to this formula and after the first feeding, he was a different baby...calm, peaceful, and happy. I was skeptical because the Gerber Good Start also has the partially broken down proteins for easier digestion and he wasn't doing well on it. But after looking into this Enfamil formula, it only has about 20% of the lactose that a regular milk-based formula has. I'm guessing that is why my son is doing so much better on this, maybe he has some lactose-intolerance going on. The reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars? I have noticed it doesn't smell or taste as sweet as the Gerber Good Start, and it's thinner so my son now eats up to 4 ounces at a feeding instead of 2-3 ounces. He also wakes up STARVING and frantic to eat. But considering it has worked as advertised and now I have a happy, peaceful baby that goes right to sleep and stays asleep, that's a small price to pay.

review/summary: This formula worked great for our lil one
review/text: After breastfeeding exclusively for the first month, we found needed to supplement with formula. We tried all different kinds of formula- all brands and formulations, and this was the only one that did not cause the baby to be fussy and gassy (more so than what's 'normal' for a baby!). I was initially turned off by the ingredients - first one listed is 'corn syrup solids'. I didn't want to feed my baby "sugar formula"! But after lengthy research on formula ingredients, I came to understand that all formulas have an ingredient that provides the 'energy' to baby, and while some use corn syrup solids and some use an alternative ingredient, they all break down in basically the same way in baby's body. It comes down to what your baby's body handles the best. For us, this formula was the winner. The switch to Enfamil Gentlease gave us a much calmer, happier baby. While it's not a miracle worker - won't make her sleep through the night or take longer naps - it did work as advertised for us.<br /><br />I've purchased this many times on Amazon - the price here is better than what I can get in store, even with using coupons.

review/summary: good formula
review/text: My son has been on this formula for the past month and a half and it's an ok formula. He has acid reflux and he was put on this formula. and he was content on this for a while, however I didn't think it was doing him justice so I put him on the nutramigen AA, and I do half and half of both formulas, and he seems to be doing MUCH MUCH better.

review/summary: It Works!
review/text: My husband and I started our daughter out on a regular formula that wasn't geard toward fussiness and gas.  We switched her over to the Gentlease because everytime she ate we could hear gas gurgling in her stomach no matter how much we burped her.  The Gentlease did reduce the gas but it caused her to have constipation.  So, after about three weeks I decided to switch her back to the formula she was on before thinking maybe we could control her gas with gas drops.  Boy, was that a BIG mistake!!  Our daughter went from being mostly mild mannered to a screaming hellion in less than 8 hours after switching the formula, she also went from sleeping great to waking up EVERY HOUR in pain from the gas.  I switched her back to the Gentlease and in about 4 hours we had our a sweet baby back.<br /><br />Pros<br />-It does what it claims to do, reduces gas and fussiness.<br /><br />Cons<br />-My daughter still has trouble with constipation but I will take the constipation over a screaming, non sleeping infant; there are things I can do to remedy her constipation.<br /><br />In short, I would recommend a parent try out this formula with their infant if they are having gas issues.  Will this formula work for everyone?  No, every infant is different and you will just have to try out some formulas to see which one works best for your baby.

review/summary: Only formula daughter can take
review/text: When my daughter would not breastfeed, I was devastated.  I pumped until my milk ran out.  Then the formula disaster started.  She started on Enfamil newborn but had horrible gas pains and projectile vomited several times daily.  Her pediatrician recommended Gentlease.  WOW!  No more spit up.  No more gas pains.  Baby is gaining weight well and is much happier with this formula!

review/text: My baby was having so much problems with gas. We started feeding him the Premium Newborn Formula and had so much gas and spit-ups. Although he still has some gas, it has significantly reduced the spit ups and crying due to gas. Highly recommend for gassy babies.

review/summary: Too thin, ate more and spit up a lot!
review/text: I started out exclusively breastfeeding my newborn until I ran into supply issues after he was a few weeks old. We had to supplement and had a sample of this and wanted to ease him into formula, so we figured Gentlease was a great choice. He didn't have gas issues on breastmilk but had been a little fussy and we weren't sure if it was due to gas, so we decided to start with it in addition to breastmilk.<br /><br />When we started this, off the bat we noticed our little guy spit up like crazy-like half his bottle at times. We paced his feedings, burped him in between bottles and did leg exercises in case it was air/gas. In addition, his feedings went from every 2-3 hours to 1.5-2 and he went up from 3oz to 4oz of formula in a matter of days. The formula is definitely thinner than others and when researching it, we found other parents pointed out the same cons we ran into. We wanted to give it a chance and thought it might just be that he had to get use to formula. After 2 weeks, not much changed so we decided it was time to switch. He had bouts of gas pain too which we found odd.<br /><br />Yesterday we not only switched him to the Costco version, we bought Dr. Brown bottles (originally using Avent-which worked just fine but we wanted to try anything to get him from spitting up as much as he had been and to reduce any gas). We're happy to report he stopped his intense liquidy spit ups and now just does it maybe once during a feeding. He has been a little gassy but hasn't cried or had little fits he had when we were on Gentlease. We also got the gas drops just in case. He also stays full closer to every 3 hour feedings and slept through the night for almost 7 hours-his first time doing that! I'll update this if things change, but so far we couldn't be more relieved!

review/summary: LACTOSE SENSITIVITY?  LOOK ELSEWHERE!
review/text: My son is 9 weeks old and has been through 4 different formulas.  Come to find out he is lactose intolerant (or very very sensitive to it.)  I suspected he was sensitive to the lactose.  He had major gas and would scream every time he ate.  Two different "gentle" milk based formulas gave him diarrhea and two different soy formulas gave him a rash, horrible constipation and my pediatrician didn't like the soy (although I and plenty of other kids I know had soy formula and we're just fine) so I purchased Gentlease since it is supposed to be for gas and fussiness and my pediatrician gave us samples.  He was on it for a full month before I decided that no matter how much time I gave it, this formula was not helping.  If anything, it was worse.  I thought it was colic but looking back, I believe this formula was the cause of most of his discomfort and screaming fits.  I am a first time mom so I had no idea.  I only wish I had thought to switch sooner.  On this formula, my baby would scream while feeding, push the bottle away, come off the nipple MANY times, only take 1-2 ounces at a time and eat every 1/2-1 hour (the formula is very thin and he couldn't eat more than 2oz at a time) I thought he had reflux due to him eating such small meals so frequently and the way he was screaming and arching his back when he ate.  Wrong.  If you have this formula, TASTE IT!  It is extremely bitter and smells yucky.  No wonder he didn't eat!  Also, it has lactose in it still so it did not help with his gas.  Immediately when he started drinking, CRAZY GAS!  This continued hours after he had finished eating and then time for another feeding.  We switched to Baby's Own organic lactose free and WOW what a difference.  Yes, it is a few dollars more but SO worth it.  Yes, he stil has a little gas but I would say it is normal baby gas and definetly not painful.  He eats 3-4oz a feeding and sleeps 2-3 hour stretches.  He is playful and happy.  MUCH HAPPIER BABY AND MUCH HAPPIER PARENTS!  Also, the new formula smells and tastes like milk.  Yes, after that experience, I had to try it.

My Son made the strangest face I've ever seen him make so I tried it - and first thought maybe I got a bad batch, but than read another review and realized - that this is just how it tastes.

review/summary: My son totally rejected it - Tastes awful
review/text: The pediatrician told us to try the Gentlease Enfamil since our son was a little gassy but he totally rejected it.<br /><br />We even tried a couple times to mix it with the regular Enfamil he was used to (he was having it for a month) but it only took him seconds to taste the Gentlease Enfamil and spit it out.<br /><br />We tried it ourselves and in fact it tastes completely different from the regular Enfamil and also from the Similac that we still had at home. None of them taste good, but this is one is really awful!<br /><br />Maybe he was so used to the regular Enfamil that he wouldn't take it no matter how it tastes but the fact is I was totally disappointed with this product.<br /><br />By the way, since he refused to take it, we simply don't know if it would help him or not with gases.

I being a bread eater found almost all that I tried to be un-ediable and uterly repulsive. BUT this bread was good, so good in fact I went and dubble checked to see if it was GF because I thaught I might have mistakenly ordered the wrong thing. Then (now this is the really supriseing part), I went back for more. I had two slices of thoast. It smells like bread, feels like bread (maybe just a little gain-y), and taste just like bread. I can't wait for my husband to try it.

review/text: I don't understand how anyone with a pair of taste buds to rub together would give this bread a 5 or a 4 or a 3 or even a 2. It's simply gawdawful bread.  I'm not sure that it should be called bread lest the wrong impression be created. I got a sample pack of 20 different breads, two slices each, of gluten free breads from EnerG.  I've tried 6 and of those 2 didn't make it thru the first bite and actually I didn't swallow those. Of the remaining 4 the grades (I'm keeping track in case I find one I like) range from C-F and there's just the one C. I may give up bread altogether if this one is considered good.  I don't think I can handle much more crushing disappointment. I'm not blaming EnerG, the ingredients are the ingredients....

My son is about 9 months old and doesn't eat a lot of these at once. It states on the packaging that they should be used within 1 week for optimal freshness. It takes my son about 3 weeks to finish a package. This caused me to give it four stars instead of five. However, I will still definitely try the other flavors that Plum has available!

review/summary: Power Puff for Digestive Health Leads the Pack!
review/text: Searching for a low-sugar wheat-free puff to offer my baby girls, I discovered Plum Organics with much joy. Clearly superior to all other major brands of baby puffs for digestive health, who's better than Plum for my family? I've successfully battled to contain a serious digestive disorder called Ulcerative Colitis for over a decade in part by special attention to diet. In that time I've learned even moderate amounts of wheat causes problems by creating an overgrowth of Candida yeast in my system. Some know this as a sensitivity to gluten or sugars, others suffer without realizing as so many foods contain wheat or high amounts of sugar. For me it's cumulative folks, a little in nearly everything really piles up. I notice my body getting too much as soon as I begin to heavily crave breads or sugars.  Before you know it, that gummy gluten renders me 90% incapable of absorbing nutrition altogether.<br /><br />Back to the Puffs... wheat is high in gluten, but the oat and rice based Puff offered by Plum Organics stands out with ingredients more gentle on digestive function. This is in addition to providing all the stuff HappyBaby remains conscious of, like sugar and vitamin content. Rice is gluten-free and minimally processed oat may be too, but many still leave it off the list of gluten-free foods due to typical cross-contamination issues with lots of wheat growing and processed alongside oats. Small amounts are ok with me anyway -- I'm looking for regulation rather than elimination here. So I'm happy to introduce all these foods to my daughters at healthy levels.<br /><br />How about the sugar content? Super low, and only natural organic fruit, vegetable or cane juice is used (not corn-syrup as another reviewer erroneously reported -[...]. And can we really get upset about a little blueberry or sweet potato juice temporarily staining a cloth when you account for their health properties? Regulate, read the labels for yourself and take joy in offering your kids a simple, low sugar, high vitamin, low gluten snack.<br /><br />Oh and must say, I love that they're mainly just puffed air with a fantastic balance of nutrients. 1/2 cup or about 75 pieces per serving keeps my little dears engaged in motor development and feeding skills for a while without concern for dietary imbalance.<br /><br />Bunch of facts, all packed up to help someone out there enjoy a little extra peace next time they offer Plum Puffs to their kids.  Live well!

I also rest assured that they are wholesome and organic, although they have a little more sugar per serving than I prefer.

review/summary: great for introducing solids
review/text: These are certainly not a great deal when you consider the product is mostly air. However, they certainly serve their purpose. We bought these as a way for our son to eat solids without the fear of him choking (these dissolve very quickly). In the process he's learning to grasp them and feed himself. They're yummy and star-shaped (not that he cares).<br /><br />I will admit that once he's got the swallowing down and we have a lessened fear of choking, we'll just switch to Joe's Os. They're cheaper, and we think healthier.

review/summary: These are like crack for cats
review/text: We have two cats, one is a fat pig, and the other is normal.  The fat pig cat will eat anything so she doesn't count.  But the normal one doesn't like food much at all and only really eats when she has too.  She has always been a depressed little cat, not really enjoying anything in life.  We have tried all sorts of treats and she ignores all.<br /><br />We got there because she had dirty teeth.  Well these things are like crack for her.  I don't know how good they are cleaning teeth because we have been only using for a few months.  But she just hears the bag and she goes bonkers.  If we forget to give them she pesters us until we do.<br /><br />Crack for Kitties.  That's what they should be named.

review/text: First I took a look at the ingredients list - there's a lot of corn stuff - corn meal, corn flour, etc.  It's pretty hard to believe that something with that much simple carbs can possibly be good for teeth.  Then I put some down on a dish for my treat-freak Beanie and he ate a few but later, even though chubby Kiki had moved in to investigate, I found a couple of treats left uneaten.  That's a pretty sure sign that they are not loved by my cats.

review/text: My cat won't eat them, plain and simple. I've tried many a' cat treats and while I can tell which ones he likes more than others this is the only one he will chase after, sniff or taste then immediately walk away from. So my review is simple, he hates them so I hate them.<br /><br />Also, for some back info on cat(in case it matters). He doesn't eat people food, has a a bowl of dry available all the time as well as half a can of wet twice a day. Also, he hates beef wet food(turns to it and kicks back as if poo in a litter box). The brand of treats were chicken though, which he loves usually.

review/summary: Too Small To Reap Benefits
review/text: I was really hoping this would help with kitty, but the pieces are too small so she just swallows it. I'm not sure if I should blame Hartz for kitty's little piggy qualities, so to be generous, it must not taste objectionable since she readily eats them. I could mix it with the rest of her food - but I doubt it does anything for breath either. Ummm...the shapes are cute to me, but kitty probably doesn't care about that. Just wish she'd be chewing on a product that garnered a few teeth crunches so some abrasive action might occur!

review/summary: 7 Happy Cats Say it's Great
review/text: We have seven rescued cats, each of which has learned over the years how to enjoy the good life.  Whereas they would accept anything to eat following their rescue from the streets, they have reached that point, like most cats do, in which they will turn up their nose on treats unless they meet their "new high standards".  They really liked the Salmon Crunch 'n Clean.  We have found that giving our cats the harder, crunchy treats tends to greatly reduce the plaque buildup our cats used to get.  While the crunchy treats haven't eliminated periodic professional teeth cleaning, it has reduced them significantly which is both cost saving and beenficial to our cats.  I highly recommend the Hartz Crunch 'n Clean as a product that is tasty to our cats and works to reduce tartar and plaque build-up.

It coats the cat's teeth with a protective barrier to help prevent tooth decay.

Hartz Crunch `n Clean comes in three flavors - chicken, salmon, and beef.<br /><br />My cat loves these treats!

review/text: Both my cats love these treats and eagerly gobble them up -- the problem is that the cats eat so quickly that they don't actually chew the treats!  The treats are smaller than their kibble, which is a large triangle/pyramid shape of food, thus they are quite easy to swallow with little or no chewing.  Since the chewing and crunching is necessary, the cats aren't really benefiting from the dental effects.  But they do love the taste, so I'm happy to give this 4 stars.

I tried four in the palm of my hand and she ate them without batting a whisker.  To say she liked them would be understating the case. Now she waits rather impatiently for her twice-a-day treat.<br /><br />Crunch 'n Clean has vitamins and minerals plus taurine, an essential for feline health.  There's just 1.1 calorie per treat and Hartz's claim is a 75% reduction in tooth tarter.  No one likes to brush a kitty's teeth--at my home that would be a life-threatening action for me--why not let Crunch 'n Clean do the job for you.  In addition, your cat will love you for it.<br /><br />Definitely two paws up on this one.

Liking them is fine and well, but my little pigs tend to eat them so fast, I don't think they chew them, thereby bypassing any dental benefits  So, I feed one treat at a time and actually hear them crunching.<br /><br />I read up on the ingredients and the corn doesn't thrill me, but I can't see anything in the ingredients to worry about.

review/summary: My finicky Persian ate them right up.
review/text: I ordered both salmon (usually my cat's favorite flavor) and beef (she usually doesn't care for beef flavoring, in fact has digestion troubles with it sometimes).  The first I tried was Salmon flavored:  I felt very sure that my slim, persnickety, Persian diva would leave these where they lay; for sure when they were delivered right after I served her a fresh serving of Friskies canned Salmon shreds.  Now, to serve her a daily dose of powdered medication, I have to mix a small amount of the powder with moist, canned food; which is why I even give her moist food.  She would smell or taste the medicine and not touch it if it wasn't mixed right, and she would eat right around it.  So, for her to eat these, I was quite pleased.  They are small, about the size of a piece of puffed wheat; and very hard and crunchy; I can hear her crunching from ten feet away.<br /><br />The ingredients list corn flour, chcken meal, wheat flour and corn gluten meal as the first of many listed. The label say's "with nutritious vitamins & minerals plus the essential amino acid taurine" and "under 2 calories per treat".  The calorie count at the bottom notes 1.1 calorie per treat.  Label advertises that the product "removes 3 times more tartar than regular cat treats", and includes an ingredient called Denta Shield, which supposedly creates a shield to prohibit further tartar build up.  The consumer has no way of verifying this of course, but I will assume that if this is even half true, and she is getting half the vitamins, it is better than nothing.  If she won't eat it, it won't do her any good.<br /><br />Now, the second time I fed her today, I offered her three more treats, and she declined to eat them, so appetite appears to have some affect on her desire to eat them.

review/summary: Cat loves them but the "crunch" is not guarenteed.
review/text: Sasha (my calico) seems to love the taste but she just swallows the treats whole without chewing. That sorta defeats the purpose of the tarter control. Perhaps if the treats were bigger cats would have to chew them.<br /><br />Needless to say, this won't replace the annual teeth cleanings or improve her breath. :)

review/summary: The Cats Meow
review/text: These treats went over big with two cats, both of whom are finicky eaters and aren't usually into cat snacks.  This is good news for them and for my wallet.  Hopefully these snacks do what they claim, keep kitty's teeth clean which will cut down on professional cleanings. Only time will tell.

review/summary: 5 out of 6 cats enjoyed this product
review/text: Gave these to a total of 6 cats and all but one quickly devoured the pieces up, awaiting for more.  The one that shunned the treat was not particularly a picky-eater either so I'm not sure what the deal was about. They are in a nice package size to provide decent amount of treats yet not too big where they might get stale if sitting too long opened.

review/summary: A real treat for my cats
review/text: Believe it or not my cats are picky when it comes to treats.  Well they love these and come running when I shake the jar I store them in.  These treats are hard and the cat has to chew it.  This means that they really do clean the cat's teeth.  There's also a chemical used in Crest toothpaste the helps prevent plaque and tartar build up.  My vet wanted over $800 to clean my cat's teeth.  I can buy a lifetime supply of these snacks for that price and my cats will be happier.  To be completely honest, I tasted one to see if it tasted like salmon.  It didn't but I had to give it a try.

review/summary: Cattie likey
review/text: I wish I could say I had a very discriminating cat like some, but my Tomcat (no, I did not choose the name) falls into the try-to-stay-out-of-the-way category. He was very pleased with his first handful and just as pleased with his second. He's waiting patiently for his third. I like to hear him crunch, crunch, crunch because I'm envisioning cleaner teeth and breath, but don't have any proof to report yet. He generally has fairly heinous breath, so here's hopin'!

review/summary: I Wish Cats Could Read...
review/text: ...Then they would read the information on the package and know how good it was for them, and perhaps take a liking to it. Of my 3 cats, none of them enjoy "Crunch `n Clean." I have tried 3 flavors: Rich Salmon, Bold Beef, and Savory Chicken, because the benefits of tartar control and "Denta Shield" are mighty appealing to the human house mate who pays the veterinarian bills (anyone who has had an estimate for feline dental work from a pet clinic knows what I mean). Tooth decay in cats is a big problem, and this product, from the information given, seems as though it would help.<br /><br />Is it the smell? The shape? What is missing here? They get all excited when they see the package, and are terribly disappointed when the likes of Purina's "Whisker Lickin's" or Whiskas' "Temptations" (the 2 snack treats they occasionally get) doesn't emerge from the little bag. The best I can do at this point is mix "Crunch `n Clean" with their regular dry food, in hopes that they'll accidentally eat some. Without that subterfuge, there's no dice with "Crunch `n Clean," just upturned noses.<br /><br />I'll give Hartz 3 stars for trying, but suggest they do some more taste testing. No matter what the product, usually at least 1 of my cats will dive in and enjoy, so "Crunch 'n Clean" must be lacking in the "appetizing factor" in a big way.  Back to the drawing board Hartz!

review/summary: Meow, meow! Give it to me now!!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:23 Mins<br /><br /></span>Cat treats fall into two categories at my house. "I will not eat that" or "Gimme, gimme, gimme!"  Happily, these fall into the "Gimme, gimmie, gimmie" category. Kitty is not a picky eater. About 90% of the treats we've tried with her are gobbled down shortly before she begs for more. These were no exception.<br />As for the tarter control aspect of the treats, I really couldn't say that they work either way. Perhaps some people have an intimate enough relationship with their cats to be able to tell if a specific treat is reducing tarter or otherwise protecting their teeth, I'm not one of those people. But, the worse case scenario is that her teeth are in the same condition before the treats as they are after, as I would be really surprised if they made her tarter problem worse, so I'll continue to feed her the tarter control treats. Maybe her teeth will be a little cleaner when she bites me in an attempt to convince me to give her more treats.

review/summary: Mr. Picky Cat eats them
review/text: My cat happily scarfed down some of these.<br /><br />These cat dental treats appear to be different than others.  DentaShield coats the the teeth to block tarter formation.<br /><br />The directions say to feed the cat 4-5 of these twice a day.  I'm guessing this little pouch to be about 2 weeks worth at that rate.<br /><br />Corn flour is the first ingredient, not really the best stuff for your cat but corn is often a major ingredient in catfood anyway.  As a treat, its probably okay, but these would be better labeled corn & chicken treats than salmon treats.  Having said that, the cat doesn't really appear to care (he can't read).  Appears to be a nutritional supplement as well as a dental treat.  Wish there was some way to know what the RDA of this stuff is for cats.<br /><br />The ingredients:  Corn flour, chicken meal, wheat flour, corn gluten meal, poultry fat, dehulled soybean meal, salmon meal, sodium hexametaphosphate, poultry digest [what is that??], dried brewers yeast, calcium carbonate, potassium chloride, salt, choline, chloride, lecithen, vitamin E supplement, niacin supplement, vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin supplement, biotin, thiamin mononitrate, folic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, vitamin D3 supplement, menodione sodium bisulfite complex, ferrus sulfate, zinc oxide, manganese oxide, copper sulfate, cobalt carbonate, ethylenediamine dihydriodide, sodium selenite, mineral oil, dl-methionine, taurine, color added (titanium dioxide, yellow #6, blue #1), BHA (a preservative), mixed tocopherols (a preservative).<br /><br />Guaranteed analysis:<br />Crude Protein min: 25%<br />Crude Fat min: 8%<br />Crude Fiber max: 4%<br />Moisture max: 10%<br />Vitamin A 2,273 IU/lb<br />Vitamin E 14 IU/lb<br />Zinc 75 mg/kg<br />Selenium .1 mg/kg<br />Taurine. .1%<br /><br />Calorie Count 1.1 per treat

review/summary: Accepted by one of the most descriminating cats!
review/text: I fed some of these treats to both cats.  Three isn't that picky but chose these over his dry food.<br /><br />So I tried it with Cassie, the one who will only eat a partial can of wet and then want another flavor.  I was totally surprised that she scarfed down the first one and wanted more!<br /><br />I am concerned about my cats dental health and I was thrilled when Cassie ate these.  And they both liked them which is an even bigger plus!<br /><br />They look like little cat paws and smell pretty much like dry cat food.<br /><br />I'm thrilled with this product and will be buying more.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />MEF

review/summary: Not for picky eaters
review/text: The treats come in 3 sizes/shapes.  The heart is the smallest.  The Chicken is middle sized.  The pig is the largest.  I've never seen a cat attack a pig.<br /><br />The green center also increases in size with the shape.<br /><br />I have 2 cats.  One who will eat anything. Catfood, chips, pieces of fruit.  And one that is a picky eater, and turns down most people food.<br /><br />Needless to say, my omnivore cat loved them!  Ate the reccomended amount and wanted more.<br /><br />Now my picky eater, he would eat the hearts.  He would put the pig in his mouth and spit it right out.  He tried again to eat the pig, spit it out again and gave me a dirty look.  The third day I tried the chickens.  He would eat exactly 2 chickens, and then start spitting them out.  The following day I tried the pigs again.  He instantly spit it out and walked away.  The 5th day I tried the hearts again and he will now just lick at the outside instead of eating it, unless I trick him with a whiskas treat first.<br /><br />My conclusion is the green center must taste pretty bad and should have an outside tasty shell for picky eaters.  Or should all be in the small heart shape.  Why the different shapes?  My cat's not going to know or care that it is shaped like a pig.

review/summary: My cats come running
review/text: My cats love these treats.  They are really hard so they have to chew them so hopefully they are cleaning their teeth.  My vet wanted $1,400 to clean my cat's teeth.  That's just not going to happen.  This is reasonable alternative that the cats enjoy.  BTW: My cats are picky when it comes to treats but they really like these.  If I can't find them, I shake the jar and they come within a few seconds.  They double as a cat caller.

review/summary: My cat is not interested
review/text: I have a cat who only likes to eat dry food.  His favorite is Meow Mix.  When I attempted to "treat" my cat with Hartz Crunch n Clean he was not interested - at all.  I tried all sorts of things to get him to eat it (like putting a little Meow nearby) and he only wanted Meow.  I gave the product 3 stars because I don't know for sure if it is my cat's problem.  So I'll give Hartz the benefit of the doubt.  Otherwise I would give the product "zero" stars.

review/summary: My multi-cat household votes paws up!
review/text: I've had a chance to try this product now with several cats (I seem to be magnet for abandoned or lost cats).  While I haven't done a close-up assessment of the cleaning power of this product, I can say that unlike other brands, all of my picky cats immediately dove into these kibbles.  Even if the cleaning is no better than other products, the fact that my cats actually seem to like it will certainly result in cleaner fangs.  This is a product that I will buy on a regular basis.

review/summary: My Cats ate them...says enough!
review/text: My 14yr old orange tabby Rusty had to have a tooth pulled so we've been looking for treats to clean my 3 cats' teeth vs having to brush their teeth for them as recommended by the Vet. Rusty's not one for the brushing thing.<br />So we've tried a few other treats but these are the only ones where he actually ate them. Normally he puts them in his mouth, licks them and spits them out. His sister Sammy cleans up (thank goodness) after him.<br />So next Vet visit I will update after we try these for a few months and re-evaluate the rating. 4 stars as I don't know the full effect just yet.

review/text: Our cat is 8 years old, and has enjoyed many treats in his life but none that pleased him as much as these.<br /><br />  He's not had any problems with his teeth, and they do seem whiter after eating these.<br /><br />  We're also pleased that the treats contain vitamins and minerals.  Would surely recommend.

review/summary: Cleans as Cats Crunch
review/text: These healthy new treats blocks tartar formation with DentaShield.<br /><br />Almost all of my cats that eat dry food happily accept these treats. I have one cat that won't eat any dry foods or treats.<br /><br />My very finicky cats loves them so they must taste good to cats.<br /><br />That they help clean the teeth are another plus. My cats also love Greenies which are beneficial to their teeth too.<br /><br />I will keep buying Greenies and these Hartz treats too. They both seem to be great products and cats really look forward to different treats. I like providing them with a variety.<br /><br />I highly recommend these treats to cat owners for their pets.

review/text: These are good cat treats.  My cats are picky but they eat these.  As for the treats plaque fighting powers, I really have no way of measuring that.  I'll take the company's word for it.  My one cat puked a few of these up after eating them.  But she pukes all the time so I can't say it the treats made her vomit or if it was just her puking like she always does.  Cats are irritating sometimes.

review/summary: well, the cat seems to like it
review/text: My cats don't have dental problems, fortunately, but I thought I would try this product just to see if they would even like it.  They gobbled it up, and managed to keep it down, so they must like it.<br /><br />Haven't had it long enough to know if it contributed to their dental health.
