review/summary: My cats eat it...begrudgingly
review/text: As with anything, one cat's trash is another cat's treasure (or something like that).  I have been experimenting with various canned and dry cat foods for my 2 cats (one is a 9 month old kitten and the other is a 3 year old).  They're generally not picky eaters, but when I decided a few months ago to switch them from Purina Indoor Cat food and Purina One Kitten Chow to higher quality cat foods, I did a considerable amount of research.<br /><br />I started them off with Evo Turkey & Chicken food, which they seemed to love at first.  At some point after I opened the second bag of Evo, they started to turn their noses up at meal time.  Not only that, I also noticed what some other Evo reviewers have said: that their breath and poo were very stinky.  My kitten loves to cuddle and my acute sense of smell just made that experience unbearable, to say nothing of litter duty.<br /><br />So onward to other options.  I figured I'd try the other highly touted Wellness brand.  Perhaps I should have predicted that they would hate this brand cat food since I had previously bought Wellness cat treats, which they will.not.eat.  I mean, they don't refuse much, but they refuse those treats.  But, since I wanted to stick with a high quality brand, I decided to try Wellness.  My cats eat it, but only do so begrudgingly and it's clear they do not enjoy it.  I have had to resort to mixing in canned food to make it more palatable until the bag is finished.  Oh, and their breath is still nauseating -- a different kind than with Evo, but still very noticeable.<br /><br />I suppose it's just as well; I was planning to switch them to canned food eventually, which they love.  The problem now is that I will have to start another hunt for the right canned food because I can't tell if the options I'm offering now are just being devoured because they actually like the flavor or if it's just better than the Wellness.<br /><br />Bottom line: as with any new pet foods, buy a small quantity before committing to it.  Especially when you're paying a premium.

review/summary: Made Cat Sick, Cost $200 to Fix, Company Wouldn't Reimburse
review/text: I purchased a bag of WellPet's Wellness Complete Health (blue bag) dry cat food at a local pet store.  I wanted to bring my experience to your customer's attention so that others won't have the same problem.  The food caused my cat to have a serious urinary tract infection that required a vet visit and special food to cure.  The total cost to me in out of pocket un-reimbursed expenses was close to $200.  I contacted Well Pet several times to request reimbursement, but they ultimately refused even though my Vet told me that the food was likely the cause of the problem.  Please advise other customers of this potential problem so they don't waste their time and money on the product, or cause their pet to become painfully sick.

review/text: I love supporting any type of gluten free 100% Organic energy bars. And from the package this looks to be a wonderful energy  bar packed with lots of the good stuff. However, it tastes like soap to me. At first, I thought it might be the banana, but my palate screams soap. Trust me, I realize I'm not eating a calorie packed chocolate bar when I purchased these.

review/summary: Perfect for nausea, morning sickness and motion sickness
review/text: I discovered these during my last pregnancy. They tamed my nausea so I could eat. They are actually so great that I can read in the car while my husband drives, and I usually get motion sickness just from sitting in the back seat. I'm ordering more for my upcoming trip to help me on the airplane, car trips and boats. I've given these to pregnant friends and they also feel much better. I have also given them to my kids for motion sickness. I just give them half or a third at a time and they suck on them. I don't actually care for the flavor of ginger, but these are fine. I wouldn't choose these as a candy I would eat for enjoyment, but they taste pretty good for medicine (which is what they are to me). Be careful with other brands of ginger candy, some of them don't actually contain any ginger, which won't help.

review/text: I bought a 5 pack of these as part of the subscribe and save deal.  I wish I hadn't.  None of my kids are fans (though they will take a bite of them, and they are handy for playground snacks even though they can't get through the whole thing).  I knew I wouldn't like them because I don't like this kind of snack, but I REALLY did not like them.  My husband said they are "ok," but he will eat anything, so I have a feeling he'll be stuck with the rest.  Organic doesn't matter if something has no taste.  I'd rather have a mainstream product that has a little flavor.

review/summary: Good option-- wish they were fortified
review/text: My 11 month son likes these, and we purchased them for him. Note that as other reviewers have stated, they are very small (what do you want for 110 calories?) and, as such, intended for young children-- this would do nothing for my appetite, but they are perfect for the under-5 set as a snack. I always sample everything I give my son, and I thought these were pretty good. If your kids do not have a pre-existing sweet tooth, they will probably like these. I thought they would have the consistency of a Nutri-Grain bar, but they are a little more "dry" than that-- as a result, they create more "crumbs" than I had anticipated, but I'm more than willing to live with it, based on the fact that they are organic (do not want to feed my son Nutri-Grain bars-- too sweet, and not organic!). The PB is very thin and so there is little danger of choking.<br /><br />Aside from the crumbs, the only real drawback for me is that they are not fortified-- no iron, zinc, little to no vitamins, etc. I do not think it would cost the company much money to add these ingredients; I thought it was sort of standard practice to fortify children's cereal/grain products, so I'm not sure why the company decided not to.

review/summary: They're for TODDLERS people -- not YOU!
review/text: First -- let me be clear I don't work for this company or have any kind of connection to  them. I'm just a mom whose kid likes them. These snacks are intended for toddlers or preschoolers -- not for the more mature (sugar numbed?) palate of an older/grade school aged child or an adult. Ever try baby food? It's pretty bland. These are not bland but they're probably not going to be the cookie treat to have with tea for an adult. They do actually taste like peanut butter and jelly -- just maybe not the Goober brand of candy sweet pb&j that comes combined in the same jar, or the creamy sugar-packed Jiff PB and Smucker's grape jelly you may glob onto white sandwich bread. This is a healthy snack and my two year-old LOVES them. She would eat the whole box (as I think most TODDLERS/PRESCHOOLERS would) if given the chance. As for the one reviewer's bug report, this may come as a shock but these are made with fruit and fruit sometimes has bugs on/around/in it. Not saying I wouldn't be thoroughly grossed out myself but stuff happens and maybe one got by them. I've never had that experience in the year we've been giving these to our daughter. Sometimes you find a piece of bone in your hamburger or you get a seed in your seedless watermelon -- it just happens. It doesn't mean you never eat those foods again. These snacks are organic, they're made with healthful ingredients and they save the day when your child won't eat enough (or any) of the dinner you made or when they're sick and super picky about what they want to eat or when they're hungry and the next meal is still an hour or more away. Don't pass these up. Grab a single box of them at BRU and see if YOUR TODDLER likes them. After all, that's what matters.

I love how the annie's condiments have very little sugar in them, very little fat and sodium and calories and no corn syrup,  and high fructose corn syrups like heniz,, reg barbecue sauces and condiments! I highly reccomended this yummy barbecue sauce!

review/text: OMG--I never thought dried fruit could taste like these--this assortment is the best ever!  I was just blown away by the freshness and flavor--ordered another right away, and I plan to continue ordering more.  I'm also going to give these as gifts in the next holiday season--you just have to taste them to believe it.  I like the fact it is USA fruit and kosher, too--it certainly looks clean and like pride went into it.  I just hope they can keep the quality the same--just can't say enough, because I realize now what I've been missing by buying dried apricots and dates in a store . . . wish they all could be California fruit . . .!:)

review/text: Perhaps I ordered at the wrong time, but I found this product to be very average.  Certainly it wasn't anything like the other glowing review above.  The fruit was OK, but certainly didn't seem very fresh.  The apricots were tough and didn't have much flavor. The date rolls with coconut were pretty tasty, but were kind of sloppily made.<br />They talked about the lovely wooden box which was just cheaply made stuff.  I would have rather have had a simple paper box with a lid.  This had no lid of any kind.  Maybe I'll try again in season, whenever that is.

review/text: Im still on the fence with this product in terms of helping me lose weight. After buying this product and then reading what the last customer wrote, I was almost hesitant to test it and wanted to return it. I figured just give a week's try and if I experienced anything similar to the last customer I would stop. The only thing I will say is that it helps curb my appetite after and a few days of taking it (I just finished week one and I am taking this product with a complex b vitamin ) I think it helped speed up my metabolism and curb my appetite. I have noticed a difference in my mid section since taking this product but then again I dieting and exercising 5 times a week for the past 2 months. I have no side effects other than it turns my urine neon yellow. I will write another update after a month of taking this product.

review/text: Dole's pineapple in sugar-free strawberry gel are completely flavorless.  The "gel" tasted on its own is watery and barely gives off the slightest taste of something sweet; I definitely could never identify it as strawberry.  Somehow, the pineapple also manages to be completely bland.  Other than ths stringy texture, there is no flavor present that even suggests pineapple -- it could as easily be pieces of pear or peach.  Even though the "gel" is sugar-free, these small cups still have 70 calories; they simply are not worth the calories.  This is a terrible product.

review/summary: A great add in sauce. Cheap too.
review/text: This is the sauce I grew up with and reminds me of summers in CT. But now I cant get it here in the South.  By itself this sauce is very thin (almost too thin). It has a tangy, spicy flavor on the vinegary side. I like as a dipping sauce but I think most will not find it all that appealing by itself. But this is the secret ingredient to making you own custom BBQ sauce simply by adding it to a more sweet, thick type such as KC Masterpiece or the like. They go perfect together.  Just mix it about 50:50 to the other sauce, put it in an open sauce pan on the stove or side burner of your grill, and let it simmer to slowly reduce it to a sticky mouth watering unique blend (add a bit of cayenne pepper powder if you like.  When the meat is about 5 minutes from being done then coat it with the cooked down sauce using a silicon brush and grill for another 5 mins. Try it, your guests will be raving about your BBQ! BTW - this is a good price including the shipping (other online grocers -ie Hometown Favorites -- charge 2 times this sellers shipping and for only 6 bottles not 12.  That's a scam if you ask me.

review/summary: Favorite BBQ sauce
review/text: I do not like the sweet, thick, dark 'Kansas City' style of BBQ sauce... this is more Carolina style with a vinegar and spices base. It has a little kick to it. I also like to blend this sauce with a sweeter sauce to get sort of a 'Memphis' style... not as sweet as KC and not quite as biting as Carolina. Try mixing this half and half with Kraft Original and slather it on chicken, ribs, or pork loin just before done so it caramelizes a little. Yeah... time to fire up the grill!<br /><br />I can't find this too often in PA. This is a really good price to stock up for the summer.

review/text: I am so happy that I tried this product! 2 of my 3 dogs can be very fussy and one was giving up dog food altogether (too much people food)! I looked it up on a dog food review site and was very impressed. When I opened the first can I was thrilled to find very small chunks (pretty much diced) pieces of chiken and vegetables. The gravy was thiker than most. I find it difficult to find chunky type foods for smaller dogs and the ones they have liked have given them loose stools.  They ALL liked this food. I highly recommend it!

I ended up draining the peppers thoroughly and putting in ziplock quart bags in the fridge.  Of course, only used one can because these are the big cans.  I use a bag at a time, saute in olive oil just to heat through with the herbs and spices that I intend for the meal. Excellent w/ Italian and other sausages and also had a cold pepper + olive oil salad.  I used one entire can within a week and a half for several good meals and it certainly saved time during this hot summer not having to roast and clean my own!

review/text: I have tried many many different protein bars over the years, and this is by far the best tasting protein bar with all the right nutrition too. 20 grams of protein + 10 grams of Fiber (40% of your daily) along with all the great vitamins and minerals @ 100% daily, even a good amount of iron and calcium both @ 45% daily. You can't beat this bar. It is just a tad gritty, but all bars with this amount of protein are and much worse. I highly recommend this bar, I have been using it daily for nearly 2 years now. Look for them at Wal-Mart, you can buy a box of 6 for around $8.00

I can eat it at home in the morning as I get ready for work, or I can take it on the go.  It tastes good and is very filling.

The only one that I found easy to eat, tastes great and doesn't upset my stomach was Detour.<br /><br />Again, to be fair to this product, it's better than most protein bars but as I said earlier I was expecting an easy eat, like a regular Snickers.

No more Natural Balance for my dog.

review/summary: Dog loves it!
review/text: I really love this brand, and so does my dog! I've raised my German Shepherd since she was 6 weeks old on a vegan diet, and she couldn't be any healthier! Her coat is soft and shiny, she has incredible stamina and seems to recover energy very quickly whenever we're doing strenuous activities, and everything about her is fit and healthy. All medical checkups turn out perfect, and she's a very happy dog. Just remember that this isn't a suitable formula for puppies because pups require a higher amount of protein than adults do. I wish Natural Balance would create a vegan puppy formula. I used Evolution for when my GSD was a pup, and then switched her over to this one because of the higher quality ingredients. Evolution isn't terrible, and my dog loved it all the same, but I prefer this blend of ingredients in Natural Balance instead--less filler ingredients.

review/summary: Quick & Easy Espresso!
review/text: Coffee pods aren't as widely available as they used to be, but I wanted to keep using my quick & easy Mr. Coffee pump-driven machine when I don't have time to grind, tamp, clean up, etc. These give produce decent shot of espresso as long as your machine produces sufficient pressure. I haven't tried them with my older Krup steam-driven machine, but those usually don't have enough pressure for pods.

review/summary: Ok applesauce but not what I expected
review/text: This applesauce was ok, it didnt have a strong granny smith apple taste like I was hoping for, but it does have a nice flavor to it that makes it its own.  The texture is really strange with this one, its almost meely if that makes sense.  I dont have a big problem with it, they taste great and the texture is doable.  The great thing about these are that they are all natural and no added sugar so I feel great about eating this applesauce.  No high fuctose corn syrup or any other fillers.

review/summary: What a wonderful way to sample new cheeses!
review/text: My daughter and her new husband have the problem of converting two complete households into a single one, so I was confounded when seeking a wedding gift for them. I finally settled on the Pub Cheese Assortment as something they could enjoy that would not add to the complexity.  Not only did they enjoy it, but they served the cheeses to guests at a wine-tasting, who also loved the different cheeses and insisted on knowing where they found them!  It could easily become my favorite wedding gift, as well as my favorite way to enjoy learning more about cheeses I can't find in my local supermarket.  I highly recommend this assortment as well as many others offered by Amazon.com. My own plan is to try them all!

review/text: The "pub cheese assortment" makes a great hostess gift, a thank-you for a holiday stay or to bring along to a party or family dinner.  I really like English cheeses.  They're not fancy cheese to eat with exotic crackers and expensive wines, they're just great, full flavors that you nibble on their own or have with just about anything you like to drink.

review/summary: Yes, You Can Eat It All In One Sitting and Sipping!  But (ha ha) Beware...
review/text: And it is GOOD!!! You get a half pound of Cotswold English pub cheese mixed with onion and chives, Cahill Farm Cheddar mixed with real porter ale (Dipper's favorite!), and "Chimay with Beer" each. This saved Dipper's day yesterday after a whole day of really hard office work with no time for lunch. I brought this item home (delivered to my office safe, sound, and well sealed) along with a growler of milk stout from our local brewpub. I watched bouncing bikini babes on E! for an hour while chowing down on the cheese and ale. I was then forced to miss work today due to, well, um, yup, cutting the cheese all night last night like a bass trumpet. I only wish Squirrely Shirley could have been around for my butt-brass solo! Buy this if you still haven't grown up and live alone.

review/summary: Healthy for our 3 dogs
review/text: We've been giving our dogs these treats for years now.  They smell sooooooo good and they're not too soft and not too hard!  They have a perfect texture.  We have 2 dogs that weigh 18 lbs each who share a biscuit.  They are easy to crack in half or even in quarters for sharing.  We also have a 30 lb dog who get's a whole biscuit at times.  Since we give our fur babies a lot of treats....the ideal is 1/2 for the 30 lb female and 1/4 each for the two 18 lb males.  All 3 dogs absolutely LOVE these and once you open up the package and smell them...you will too!  Our fur babies have many allergies but these biscuits don't stir up ANY allergy's at all.

review/summary: Not an espresso grind
review/text: This product is not ground sufficiently finely for use in an espresso machine -- it just makes coffee, not espresso. I'm not sure how other reviewers are comparing this to Lavazza or Illy, as it's a completely different grind from those brands. Since I have no need for moderately-finely-ground coffee, I have to figure out what to do with the rest of this stuff.

review/summary: Excellent Italian Espresso!
review/text: Out of all the Italian espresso I've tried, I think Illy is the best. But how can a regular espresso drinker afford the usual $14/can price? I was ecstatic to find Ferrara decaf because not only is it just as good as Illy, but it's a quarter the price! I love it and am happy to have finally found an affordable way to drink real Italian espresso every day. I've tried Lavazza and although it's fine, it's just not as smooth and delicious as Ferrara or Illy...it tastes cheaper. Finally, I can replicate the coffee I had in Europe! And as for Starbucks espresso and cappucino, just forget it...it just doesn't measure up in terms of taste or price. I recommend a Bialetti Moka pot.

review/text: You who can buy panorama eggs from www.amazon.com don't know how lucky you are. I can't buy them from www.amazon.co.uk. because Amazon here doesn't sell them. Very few in the UK even knew what a panorama egg was until they saw mine (I am a Canadian who has lived in the UK for almost 30 years) which I received as a child and never chose to eat because it is so pretty (although the roses on top of it are now rather faded). I now make my own panorama eggs for my grandchildren, a labour of love I can tell you, because making them takes time and patience. If you are where you can buy panorama eggs, do! You won't regret it. The dozen small eggs look fantastic!

review/text: I like Green Mountain's Nantucket Blend and have often bought it in whole bean or ground form to brew in a standard coffeemaker.

review/text: This chili oil product is a perfect complement to many dishes, particularly those of Asian influence but in no way limited to Asian cuisine.  It goes well with almost any stir fry, great on seafood, etc...  The beauty of this product is that it is NOT very spicy and is primarily sesame oil which you can still taste the slightly toasted sesame flavor, but with a mild chili kick.  It adds that little kick to your plate that you desire, without overpowering the food you are eating.<br /><br />Disclaimer, my wife is a chef and we have turned many friends onto this product.

review/summary: SOURED ON THIS CHOICE !!
review/text: The case arrived with the pieces mostly broken and the confectioner's sugar "dusting" all moist, gummy and barely coating the cookies (most of the coating had fallen off). They looked gross, so they ended up NOT being served to guests as a light dessert. Some tasted stale even though they were (barely) in date. The lemon flavor is quite unnatural and the pieces of hard lemon candy baked into these "shortbreads" contributed to this very unnatural flavor. Not a plesant experience and I actually ended up tossing them after tasting the first few boxes. The fact that the shortbreads were broken--very few were whole cookies--added to the disappointment of this purchase. I can't recommend them for these reasons and won't purchase again.
