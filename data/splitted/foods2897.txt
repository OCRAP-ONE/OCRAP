review/summary: Wonderful stuff
review/text: This is the first time I've tried any coconut oil, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I really, really like this stuff. It lives up to all the hype, and I assume it's as good for me as everyone says. It's solid at room temperature, easy to scoop and spread, and has a great, mild flavor. I've tasted it plain, added it to smoothies, spread it on bread, and used it in place of butter for cookies. Very versatile.

review/summary: Better than I thought it would be
review/text: I was skeptical of the difference in all natural organic and the stuff you get from a regular grocery store.  I bought other coconut oil mostly due to the fact that it was the same price as olive oil and I thought it was "all natural" as it basically stated it on the container.  After reading reviews of the other stuff I bought not being organic I decided to give this a try.  While this is definitely pricier, the difference is astounding!  If you like the taste of coconuts, this is the bomb.  The other tasted nothing like coconuts, or really anything at all, so when I opened the container of this I was quite intrigued.  I put this on vegetables and when I cook fish and it definitely helps with the vegetables since I have to generally force myself to eat them.  With that said, I don't think I would buy this product again simply due to price.  I would go to another brand assuming they are as good since you can buy much more for only a little bit more in cost.  This changed my whole view toward organic, and hopefully makes me healthier.  If you read this review look at all the stuff they put in processed food ... specifically benzene!  I work in chemical plants, so I know how terrible this stuff is, and the fact they use it in food processing blows my mind!  Also, the fact that they don't have to tell you is even crazier.  There is no way this type of stuff doesn't harm you!

review/summary: Plastic Container
review/text: I ordered this thinking it would come in a glass jar.  I was disappointed to see that it comes in a plastic container.  It is labeled as recycling #1 (PETE), which from what I have read can leach phthalates when left in the heat (which is was, since the package was left on the porch in the sun and who knows where it was before that).  I don't like to take my chances with chemicals leaching into a product that I want to put on my skin and in my food.  I tried to return it but surprisingly (and happily), Amazon refunded the money without requiring me to send this back. WOW!  Way to go Amazon for customer service.  I just think the description of the product should specify that it comes in a plastic container.

review/summary: Good until it comes back up!
review/text: I loved this product when I initially received it.  I purchased it to use as a dietary supplement and was pleased to discover that it works wonders on hair and skin as well.  I read the label carefully because I was concerned about whether or not to refrigerate.  The label clearly said that refrigeration was not required.  However, after appx. 2 weeks of using as a daily dietary supplement, I began to notice an awful cramping, nauseous feeling not long after I took it.  It was the sickest I have ever felt in my entire life and I repeated it just to be sure that it was the coconut oil causing it and not something else I had eaten.  Same thing again.  All I can figure is the oil went rancid.  There's no other explanation for why it suddenly started causing me to be sick.  So, word to the wise, consider refrigerating this product.  I've stopped using it altogether because I now associate the smell of it with sickness. :(

review/summary: Alive, Ageless, Gourmet and Gathering Years... meaning the oil!]
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 9:15 Mins<br /><br /></span>Some say the COCONUT palm is the Tree of Life.  They say Life is honored and perpetuated through its meat, its water, its oil, its presence.<br /><br />In my opinion, EVAGold, and the Nutiva brand of coconut oil shown in the video, are among the highest qualities available, of life healing offerings from this sacred gift of a tree.  I had sensed this cold pressed oil's uncanny value as soon as I saw a picture of a jar of EVAGold on Swanson's product list on Amazon.  I had come to trust Swanson [as much as I continue to trust Amazon] from purchases of several types of magnesium supplements including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RCMAG">Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz Spray</a>.<br /><br />Reading Bruce Fife's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q360CS">The COCONUT OIL MIRACLE</a>, provided necessary information for working  with this fruit.  Reading that book also clarified my previous belief in the healing nutrition in coconut oil, and in these brands' production purity [other excellent brands are also available; these two are just the ones I've used successfully so far].  My experience of using this type of cold pressed, virgin coconut oil for only 24 hours had shown results which made me feel blessed!<br /><br />I've been slowly and steadily rectifying a serious magnesium deficiency while searching for what felt like a missing catalyst or synergistic essence which would cause magnesium supplementation to be accepted by the body, and then seated into the cellular level of life enhancing operations.  Dr. Carolyn Dean's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ODEPY4">The MAGNESIUM MIRACLE</a> is an excellent guide to Magnesium's magic in healing, normalizing, and strengthening the embodied human soul.  I've been thinking that coconut, in its several forms of use, could work as a catalyst for magnesium, while magnesium works as a catalyst for all other nutrients, including coconut oil, to function correctly.  What a team!!<br /><br />To understand the vital message in what I'm trying to say here, please be cajoled or even coerced (jokingly) into reading some of my Amazon.com reviews on magnesium products and the two books linked above... as a start on a journey to understanding, appreciating, and relishing LIFE.  Other great Magnesium and Coconut books and products are available, easily found using search capacities.<br /><br />According to some experts, the most important thing to know about oils, fats, and coconut products is that they should be gently, minimally, and carefully processed by cold pressing, preferably labeled ANH (absolutely no heat used in processing); the reasons for this are detailed in Fife's book.<br /><br />Also according to some experts, the most important thing to know about magnesium is that it needs to be held in highest priority and percentage in the minerals taken into the body, and that certain foods, additives, and supplements can defeat bio-availability of magnesium.  Especially calcium needs to be taken in much lower amounts than magnesium, and in the current food marketplace and general eating habits; calcium is usually assimilated in large quantities, causing illnesses related to calcification or deposits, and contributing to magnesium deficiency.  This situation is detailed in Dr. Dean's book.<br /><br />My main concern with coconut usage for persons like me who are severely deficient in magnesium is that most offerings of coconut I'm aware of hold more potassium than magnesium, which could upset the balance and primary necessity of magnesium.<br /><br />In my non-professional opinion magnesium is the INDEX nutritional substance; the A-Priori for Life.<br /><br />Maybe even the Tree of Life needs magnesium as its priority nutrient...<br /><br />With adequate magnesium held within the cell structures... [some experts say cells need to retain 10,000 times more magnesium than any other mineral]... the body can adequately and correctly utilize other minerals and necessary nutrients, in order to live strong and disease free. [See my review of Dr. Dean's book.]<br /><br />Maybe magnesium seats life, coconut is the cozy catalyst, and taste buds rule!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />Other excellent coconut oils available on Amazon:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAT6NG">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Jar</a><br />[The link above goes to the large size, the one I showed in my review on Bruce Fife's book]<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a> [This is the product used in the video here.  Though the flavor and quality of the EFAGold was slightly better, of the bottles I've used so far, I will happily and thankfully continue to purchase all three of these products, for various reasons favoring each.]

review/summary: I don't eat it, but I love it for my skin and hair!
review/text: People usually use coconut oil for food consumption, but I don't because I eat low-fat and get what I need by consuming small amounts of whole nuts, seeds or avocado.  Oil is not a whole food and is pure saturated fat. You may want to debate me on this, but I am not open to change my view (I have studied up on this and know I feel much better and have more energy without loading up on lots of fat and protein).<br /><br />I prefer to use this oil for my hair and as a moisturizer for my body.  It has a great smell (I think about the coconut butter people use when they go to the beach) and it is certified organic.  It make my hair and skin feel soft and silky and lasts a long time, as I have the same container for almost a year.

review/summary: It would have been 5 stars but a whole section of the coconut oil was missing from the jar
review/text: I never write reviews, because I have not had any complaints on any of my products that I have purchased through Amazon.  I understand that its not just about bad reviews but good ones too, but for me the product is always great unless I am writing a review.  Thus here I am writing a review today.  I must state that if the coconut oil had not been missing an entire section of coconut oil from the right side of the jar, I would be giving this product 5 stars.  I love the taste, quality, shipping time etc., but the missing oil in the right side of the jar (the oil is solid) shocked the heck out of me.  I would have written something earlier about this, but I just haven't had the time.  Every time I look in the jar though, it still shocks me.  I wondered if it was due to the way the product was packaged.  Maybe it rolled onto its side and caused the top to be more full and the right side to be empty, however, it wasn't full to the top.  Also it's solid and I didn't order it during the warm months for it to be liquid and change.  So, yes, I feel ripped off.  However, I'm using the coconut oil because I do need it and already have it in my possession.  I will not be buying my now bi-monthly supply again through this dealer though, unless they decide to make this right.

review/summary: Wish I had Found This a Long Time Ago!
review/text: This coconut oil is the perfect moisturizer for both my hair and skin. I have been searching for a solution for dry skin and hair that did not involve a concoction slop of chemical madness. Massage this into your skin after a hot shower or before bed for great results. It also works great as a hair moisturizer and I even use it for hot oil treatment. Coconut oil absorbs very well into my hair without leaving it greasy (a little goes a long way). Make sure to put it on last as a sealant for any other moisturizers that you use. I feel a lot better knowing that something I am putting onto my skin and absorbing into my bloodstream does not contain a mass of impossible to pronounce ingredients. My only advice is that you find some kind of bottle to put it in or mix it into your favorite lotion. I rinsed out an empty shampoo bottle. I find that at room temperature, constantly dipping your hand in gets kind of messy. I love it!

review/summary: I first got this for baby's eczema...
review/text: I was looking for natural moisturizers that alleviate symptoms of eczema and I came across this coconut oil.  My baby is 5 months old and after 24 hours of applying this oil from head to toe, his red patches were significantly reduced.  My whole family was amazed at the results.  No, it is not a cure but it is a good moisturizer to use on a baby with eczema, espeically for the face since my baby sucks on his hands, rubs it all over his cheeks and then takes it right back into his mouth.<br />I decided to take 3 tsps a day (now a bit more because I love the taste and texture so much) as a supplements since it has antifungal and lots of lauric acid (found in breastmilk) which strengthens the immune system.  I was hoping that some of it will get passed on to my milk and help my son fight his eczema from the inside.  Actually, I read that eating just 3 tsps a day, the lauric acid content in breastmilk jumps up from 3% to 9%.  As far as the results, I don't know if the coconut oil through my breastmimlk helped him but I sure got hooked!  I love the taste, texture, and look forward to taking my suuplemental tlbs.  I plan to bake with it this weekend and have asked my husband to use it for cooking as well.  I've rubbed some on my hands and face and it feels really soft and well moisturized.  I haven't tried it in my hair yet but plan too.  When I told my coworkers about my new obsession, they seemed a bit confused but really, read about the countless benefits and see how easy it is to substitue coconut oil for so many of your daily care and food.  I'm ordering the 54oz tub from a different brand from amazon today.

review/text: Trying to find a natural alternative for my acne I came across this and hooked Since my first day of college my face that was once flawless exploded into acne (I was 18 then). It hurt, throb, left scars, terrible blemishes, cystic acne along my cheek and chin area, very oily t-zone, large pores on my cheeks, blackheads and dry patchy areas. Worse thing about it I had new ones almost everyday and my chest and acne were the same.<br />Desperate I read up all the natural benefits in using coconut oil internally and externally and it i knew it wouldn't hurt to try. My face was terrible as it is. Anyway when I started applying this externally, my back and chest acne lessen within a month and a half. I have to say it didn't disappear like magic however I notice my skin felt smoother, my skin tone was more even than before,my dry patchy area disappeared and best of all less acne. But my cystic acne still kept coming.<br />So determined I changed my chemical based products into 100% natural. Basic natural cleanser, toner, and moisturizer which is my bestfriend coconut oil and also a healthy diet. Within 6 months of using this externally and internally my face is completely clear with only a once and while breakout and I'm currently 1 month away from being 20 and almost getting to flawless. Except my acne scars is a huge problem for me for the moment.<br />My sisters and I also use it for deep hair conditioning, and some facial treatments.<br />Coconut Oil is creamy and delicious as well. I love eating this with my toast and putting it in my favorite coconut chicken curry. I've noticed when eating coconut oil or just adding it into my food my appetite isn't as big as it was before. Not sure if its because its a healthy type of fat.But anyway I absolutely love, love , love this product.<br /><br />however with the acne part, its not for everyone. I'm fortunate enough that this work wonderfully for me. But it wouldn't hurt to try. Its affordable and no harsh chemicals added at all.

review/summary: Delicious and Fresh, no complaints in regards to the product quality...BUT
review/text: I love this coconut oil, I ordered 4 quantities and all of them were super fresh and tasted very delicious. The texture was great and it's a joyous treat to use every time. Coconut oil has many uses, but I use it mainly as a dietary supplement. I use it to cook my morning eggs or sauteing vegetables with the omelet, add some to my oatmeal every morning, put a little in my tea or coffee, add some to my protein or fruit shakes, or just take it by the spoonful which is melt in your mouth deliciousness.<br />I am a very active person and a health nut, and I follow a low-carb diet and way of life, so I put great emphasis on consuming lots of quality oils and fats in my diet. Coconut oil makes the perfect addition. I am 100% satisfied with the quality of this coconut oil.<br /><br />However, having said all of this, one thing that I wish was different about the product was the package. The jar is plastic and my limited knowledge in chemistry points me to the old knowledge that "like dissolves like"... and since oils and plastics are both derived from nonpolar substances, this leads me to worry that there will be plastic leaking into the oil. Albeit this is a tremendously slow process, nonetheless it still makes me second guess coming back to this product and purchasing a brand that uses glass jars instead. If they change their packaging methods, I will have no problem purchasing this brand again. Although, I did not take off any stars for this reason because most coconut oil packages these days seem to come in plastic containers, so it wouldn't be fair to rate this brand less than others.<br /><br />One thing that I have done to lessen my worry is to refrigerate the oil so that it solidifies. My rationale behind this is that less oil is in contact with the plastic container when the oil is solidified because only the edges touch as opposed to a liquid form, which is constantly mixing and makes more surface area contact. I actually like to take my coconut oil when solidified because I like how it melts slowly when eaten and you can savor the taste better.<br /><br />I hope this helped others.

review/summary: One of my New Kitchen Staples
review/text: There was a time when I went out of my way to avoid coconut oil - I'm not quite sure if I was confusing it with palm oil, or if medical science was actually lumping it together with all the other saturated fats as a dietary NO-NO.  Of course that's all changed now, and coconut oil is recognized as one of the 'good' oils - but it was still only recently that I had a chance to try it for myself.  Wow!  It's great stuff.<br /><br />Coconut oil has a unique quality in that it has a melting point of 76 degrees, F - and out here where I live (Oregon), that means I seldom see it as a liquid oil (even in summer) - but that's fine with me, for one of the things I like using it for is in biscuits and pie crust, and for those, it has to be solid - and as a solid fat, coconut oil is quite hard (really hard!), even when close to 75 degrees - and for that reason, it is much better for use in baking, where a hard fat works much better than a soft one.<br /><br />But another characteristic of coconut oil that I love is its flavor and aroma - when you open the jar and stick your nose down in it, you are enveloped in the beauty of the coconut's best element, its aroma - its almost frightening how beautiful that smell is.  Maybe it's just me, but that aroma literally sends me to the tropics each time I open the jar.<br /><br />And then there's the flavor.  Most fats have little or no flavor - in fact, as cooks we've been taught to use a fat with no flavor in our cooking.  However, we all know that many fats are flavor!  And if we remove the fat, we lose much of the flavor.  Well friends, coconut oil is a fat with super flavor!  Anything you make with it will have the subtle flavor of the topics - I use it when I make rice, when I do S E Asian dishes and curries, and to make great scrambled eggs.  When you begin using it, coconut oil will open new doors of creativity in your cooking - and you will love it too.

review/summary: Tastes Good, Great Price, May Help Your Health
review/text: I came across some research that suggested organic extra virgin coconut oil might help people suffering from Alzheimer's.  Before giving it to my parents, I decided to test it myself to see how it tasted and to check for side effects.  A visit to the health food store and I was ready to check it out.<br /><br />Honestly, it has replaced butter and olive oil in most of my applications, becoming my fat of choice.  It may all be in my head, but I am convinced I am "sharper" when taking it.  My parents are getting about a tablespoon a day, and enjoy it on bread as a treat.  They are more alert than they were more than a year ago - I can't prove it's because of the coconut oil, but it's the only thing we've changed.  Draw your own conclusions....<br /><br />When I found Nature's Way at Amazon, the price blew me away.  When I read about the subscription program (save some $ and get free freight), I decided to try it.  Getting 16 ounces is convenient, and having it come regularly with free shipping (even though it's less than $25) makes it a great value...and it tastes better than the stuff I'd gotten at the health food store.<br /><br />Heck, it's under $10 - give it a try!

review/summary: Topical miracle...!!
review/text: After doing a lot of research on coconut oil, I knew I had to give it a try. The product arrived quickly and as a liquid (I live in FL and it is summer- i expected this), and the smell is just sooooo delicious!!I have not used it in cooking yet, as I started using it topically and want to order a separate batch to cook with, but I have to say I am completely BLOWN away by the effects it has had on my skin already. I am a fair skinned female and have always been a target for mosquitoes. For most of my life I have been embarrassed by the multiple and never ending itchy, ugly bug bites and rashes these annoying little things have left on my skin. (mostly my ankles and legs) and am sometimes reluctant to wear shorts, dresses, and things that don't cover my legs (Which can be very difficult, considering just how HOT it is in FL)because it makes me feel self conscious and less confident about myself.<br /><br />Naturally, when I received the product the first place I started lathering it onto was my feet and legs, and I continued to do this several times a day. I WISH I had taken a before and after photo, as I did NOT expect the results to turn out as they did. Within 2 days, many of the little red spots had COMPLETELY disappeared. Furthermore, the scars and marks that were left from previous encounters have started to fade and are becoming less noticeable each day. Mind you, I have only been using the stuff for about 2 weeks. But like I said, I am completely blown away by the effects thus far. Additionally, I have started to apply the oil to a few moles that I have, and am very excited to see if there are any results in a few weeks (I will follow up with this post as needed)<br /><br />I order items frequently from amazon.com, and do not have the time to review many of the things I purchase. However, the effects from the coconut oil literally seemed to good to be true and now I know why many others have felt the need to 5 star review this product as well. I am a pharmacy student who is turning more and more to alternative treatments and natural remedies every day. I can not wait to be able to educate the public in regards to products such as this. And did I mention? I wore shorts to work for the first time the other day; no more self esteem issues, and my confidence is skyrocketing :)

review/summary: Great in Coffee, Oatmeal and Shakes!!
review/text: I am trying this coconut oil as a dietary supplement. By itself, 1 Tbsp tastes very rich and coco-nutty. Too rich for me so, I decided to put it in a cup of coffee. It was delicious!! I used Columbian coffee (Green Mountain, Fair Trade Select K-Cup), sugar and some hemp milk (Pacific Natural Foods). That is definitely a keeper!! If you don't drink coffee, I'm sure it would work great in a cup of hot cocoa as well.<br /><br />Later, I decided to try it in some oatmeal. I mixed the following into a cup of cooked oatmeal: 1/2 Tsp cinnamon, 2-3 Tsp sugar, 1 Tbsp coconut oil. When the coconut oil melted completely, I added 3-4 Tbsp hemp milk to cool it down. My taste-buds were amazed!! Tomorrow, I will try this with raisins. Mmmmm.<br /><br />We make a lot of fruit shakes at our house and I've had coconut in them before, so I know this will taste great in a shake too. Here's the recipe I'm going with: Banana, Cantaloupe, Orange Juice, Ice, Hemp Milk, Honey (maybe) and Coconut Oil.<br /><br />I still have to find one more meal that I can add this to in order to keep up with the recommended 4 x 1 Tbsp daily dosage, but I'm sure it will be no problem to find something else that this goes well with.

review/summary: Coconut oil was given a bad rep
review/text: I was diagnosed as a borderline diabetic two years ago, and also have borderline cholesterol problems.  When going over my dietetic guidelines, the nurse suggested that I use coconut oil.  I was shocked!!!  I remember when the cholesterol police had coconut oil removed from the movie theaters because it was a bad fat.  Shows you what they new...just like they said you shouldn't have more than 1 or 2 eggs a week, or you should give up caffinated coffee.  And now they've discovered that was all a bunch of bull.  I tried to find this oil in my local Jewel supermarket today, but they had no coconut oil.  They had probably 20 different kinds of oils...ones you couldn't even imagine...but no coconut.  So, I thought...hmmm..I'll bet Amazon has it.  I can't wait till it gets here so I can have my favorite snack made just a little bit more healthfully...popcorn.

review/text: I purchased this due to my use of coconut oil products in my hair. I am currently using the Coconut Oil by Organic Root Stimulator and decided to go with something more natural since ORS contains petrolatum. While I'm sure this product works great I cannot attest to that because the smell was nauseating to me. If you love the strong smell of coconut then this may be for you.

review/summary: not what i expected
review/text: It is definitely not the item that will save me from buying conditioner and hands cream. The item arrived safely. The plastic jar was not a problem. However, in terms of helping for disentangling hair and making it brighter (as a regular conditioner would do), reasons for which I bought it, this product did not work. I tried to put the 1.5 tsp, 1 tsp, 0.5 tsp and it did not help at all. I tried to wash once with shamppo, twice, putting soap on dry hair, etc but the result was always the same: very dull hair and difficult to comb. It did not help either as a skin softener at all for soap-dried hands. It absorbs quickly but feels sandy and the effect was unnoticeable. The flavor/smell of this coconut oil may be good for preparing sweets only.

review/summary: Great Coconut Oil to use
review/text: This product is great to use if you want to deep condition your hair and scalp with it.  I used the coconut oil along with the Suave Professional hair conditioner, put a plastic cap on my head and sat under the hair dryer for thirty-minutes with the hair dryer on the low setting, and noticed that my hair was much softer and easier to manage.  I have been natural for about a year and six months or longer (without a perm in my hair).  Since I noticed a difference in my hair I wanted to make sure that my hair was softer because of the coconut oil, because I had just started using the Suave Professional conditioner; so when it was time to shampoo my hair again, I put the same conditioner on my hair sat under the hair dryer for thirty minutes with the setting on low as usual without the coconut oil on my hair and noticed that my hair was not as soft as when I used the coconut oil on my hair in addition to the conditioner.  My hair was still soft, not to imply that Suave Professional is not a good conditioner and didn't make my hair soft.  However, my hair seemed much softer when I used the coconut oil and the conditioner on my hair.  It is also great to use on the scalp as well.  Usually when I grease my scalp with sulfur 8 fresh hair & scalp conditioner (in the yellow jar with the blue cap) after washing and conditioning my hair within three to four days I wash and grease my hair again because my scalp no longer feels clean.  Since I started greasing my scalp with the coconut oil first, just a very little on the scalp area, then put the sulfur 8 fresh hair and conditioner on my scalp on the same scalp area where I put the coconut oil, my scalp feels healthier; after only two treatments of greasing my hair with the coconut oil and sulfur 8.  I am assuming that using the coconut oil with any conditioner and any hair grease will make the hair and scalp feel healthier, softer and easier to manage.  I highly recommend using this product or any other coconut oil if you want to use the product to help with the conditioning of your hair and/or scalp.

I originally bought this for weight loss it has given me a little more energy, enough for me to start exercising again, however I gained 3 lbs that I had just previously lost before taking this. So that was upsetting. The funny thing is I only take like a teaspoon in the morning with my coffee. So if anyone is reading this, can you please let me know if I am wasting my time trying to loose weight with this or if it's normal to gain weight first before you loose it? I have only been taking it a week. I have tried to use it as a moisturizer as well, it does absorb nicely after 5 minutes but my fine lines are more noticeable. Any suggestions?

The smell was so bad that I ran to wash my hands and I refused to put that in my hair or on my skin. It melted into basically water, as for that part maybe that was expected to happen because it's an oil. On the other hand, the smell I doubt was supposed to be that potent and bad. I will be throwing it away because I cannot use it or give it away to anyone.

I was expecting a glass jar, but was disappointed when it arrived in a plastic jar (BPA, anyone?). From the outside, it looked like the oil had separated and that some had settled in the bottom. When I stuck a spoon in, I found it was hardened/had solidified on the bottom. I was able to break it up into smaller chunks, but it wouldn't dissolve. The oil I was able to get out of it worked, but I'm disappointed with the quality of the one I received. Too cheap to be worth returning.

review/summary: Not the best
review/text: I could not figure out what the difference was between this product and the one I have been using.  This comes in a 16 oz. plastic jar, mine comes in 14 oz jar.<br />this one is less expensive, that is where I get nervous.  So I examined both jars, this one has 10 more calories than mine for each tablespoon.<br />This one has 13 grams of saturated fats and mine has 12.  None of these is a problem ans is well within range, then I noticed this one can be cooked up to 350 degrees.<br />Mine can be cooked no higher than 280, this means that this one is refined,  mine is unrefined, this one is more processed.  Not what I want.  I am sure it is not a huge deal but I want the best I can get.  With all that said, I really cannot taste a very big difference between the two, I did a side by side taste and texture taste and they are close to being identical.<br />There is a lovely coconut flavor and a nice oil taste.  The coconut did not overpower the foods in my recipes which I thought it would.<br />I used it on my face hair and body.  It is cooling and smooth, it does take a little time to soak in so I use it at night and in the morning I feel silky smooth.  It has not clogged my pores so I wake up and there are not blemishes.<br />It is also extremely good for your pets, cats dogs and birds.  My dog absolutely loves this but be careful you must start by giving a very small amount (1/4 tsp.)and build it up to a tsp. per 20 lbs. of animal over a month.  If you are not careful they will suffer from die back.  Google that, you may see Herxheimer's reaction, it is about the same thing and happens to humans also.  I had it once it is not pretty, although it is very good sign in the long run.<br />I like this product but I will stick to my unrefined brand.

review/summary: Curbs Your Appetite, Gives You Energy & Makes You Regular!
review/text: I decided to order this product after reading a few books about the benefits of coconut oil.  I received this product about two weeks ago & here are my observations:<br /><br />1)  It totally curbs my appetite and gives me a sense of satisfaction so I don't have to eat every couple of hours.<br /><br />2)  It gives me so much energy!  I usually have to drink two cups of green tea to get me going & maybe a cup of coffee if it's a very busy day but since I started using coconut oil, my energy level is higher and I get a lot more done without burning out.<br /><br />3)  It made me regular, not to be too detailed but you will have a movement after almost every meal.<br /><br />4) No morning breath!<br /><br />5)  Soft, silky skin & hair.<br /><br />6)  No toothache.  I had a cap that came loose so I had my dentist bond it back on but it kept bothering me as if it was infected or something but since I started using coconut oil, whatever was going on is totally healed.<br /><br />We are on our 2nd bottle already!  I love it so much I also use it as moisturizer, just be careful when applying it to your shoulders, especially if you have long hair, it will make your hair greasy.<br /><br />I hope you have the same positive experience.

review/summary: Awesome product!
review/text: My Mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's two or three years ago and didn't even seem much like my Mother anymore.  I started giving her the coconut oil slowly--just a teaspoon a couple of times a day at first, but graduated that upward to at least three tablespoons per day--and my Mother gradually appeared again.  If you have a loved one with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia, you should do some research on that.  It is worth the bother!  The product smells and tastes really great!<br /><br />The service has also been great!  I have it scheduled to deliver a certain amount of the product at a certain time interval.  I don't have to bother to remember to reorder it.  It comes like clock-work!

review/summary: Great for hair care and for cooking
review/text: I'd suggest to buy TWO containers, one for hair use and one for cooking use. I originally bought this to use on my daughter's hair -- she fussed a bit about leaving it in her hair for two hours, but the results were amazing, far better than any conditioner we've tried on her hair.<br /><br />I don't care for the taste of this oil on toast but it's terrific for frying -- eggs, hash browns, greasing the griddle for pancakes -- superior results, better than butter, better color, better taste. It's pretty much a 1:1 replacement for butter. Very pleased with this product.

review/summary: Wow where has coconut oil been all my life - just Google the health benefits and be amazed!
review/text: This is my first experience with coconut oil. I heard about it and read up online and was amazed at the health benefits. I found this brand to have the best reviews/price so I went with it. I'm getting ready to purchase my 3rd one in as many months. It has a delicious yet subtle coconut flavor and is now one of only 3 oils I use in my cooking (+olive oil, avocado oil).<br /><br />My uses:<br />-Replace butter/fat/oil for non-stick cooking - except when using olive or avocado oil, this is my go to. In the skillet before eggs/bacon/pancakes/etc.<br />-On toast/pancakes etc. as a butter replacement - that little hint of coconut is delicious and the fattiness is reminiscent of butter.<br />-A tablespoon in my smoothies (for the health benefits)<br />-Oil replacement in baking recipes - it works just as well and is healthier!<br /><br />It's important to note that in cooking, the coconut flavor does not persist. If I add it raw I get that flavor but my eggs/bacon, for example, do not have coconut flavor after being cooked in this oil.<br /><br />HEALTHY: Read up on all the health benefits but here's the main one: yes this is a saturated fat. However, it's made up of medium-chain fatty acids. This type of fat is readily converted to energy and rarely stored as fat. Research shows that coconut oil (in moderation, of course) helps you lose weight and speeds up your metabolism. A few tablespoons a day is GOOD FOR YOU!<br /><br />My only con for this product is the plastic jar/tub. I hate plastic. Glass would be nice, as always!

review/summary: Great for hair
review/text: I bought this to use as a hair conditioner after reading about it in a magazine. I have long thick hair with split ends. When it came in I decided to try it. It has a wonderful nutty smell and is solid at temps below 70 degrees. I took a chunk out and rubbed it into my palms and then into my hair after shampooing. I made the mistake of just rinsing it out instead of following with another shampoo. Don't do this unless you want grease head! So, the next time I did the same thing, shampoo my hair first apply the coconut oil and allow it to sit for a while, but this time I shampooed it out. Boy what a difference! My hair was soft, shiny and manageable for the rest of the week. I now use it about once a week as a deep conditioner. Great stuff and I'm glad that I found it.

review/summary: Bought it for my dog, but love it for myself!
review/text: I initially bought this for my dog.  She has sensitive, dry skin, and will get rashes on her legs.  I just rub this in and wah-lah!  No more itchy skin.  Not to mention, unlike so many other products, it is completely fine if she decides to go to lick-town on it.  It also smells amazing, so it isn't a big deal if she gets it on something.  I also have dry skin, so I will rub it on my elbows and massage it into my scalp.  After that, you can put it in recipes in place of butter in order to replace some bad fat with good fat.  I am all for a product that is multipurpose and very ecofriendly.  Anytime you can go natural, you definitely should.  Maybe it's just the glue-eating kid in me, but I think it's pretty awesome that I can eat my conditioner/lotion.

review/summary: ...great for Hair!
review/text: I recently bought this product after hearing great reviews on it and I can say that I definitely agree. I use this on my hair exclusively, I am an African-American and have natural hair. I usually just "seal" my hair with this, which it's good for, but it can be greasy. I don't really know how to combat that, but it doesn't really have too much of a smell either, which is good b/c I don't know how I feel about the smell of coconut. The amount is quite enough for the price, but depending on how much you use it may not last as long as it looks like it will. Mine probably won't last too long, but I will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Wow!  The best smelling and tasting coconut oil yet!
review/text: I'm very strict with my diet. I eat only organic foods, practice CRON (calorie restriction with optimal nutrition), eat minimal carbs and lots of nutrients. I've tested 4 other brands of organic coconut oil -- Nutiva, Spectrum Naturals, and 2 small scale raw food companies. This one is easily the best so far.<br /><br />The aroma is wonderful and the texture is much fuller than the other brands. This coconut oil has fuller taste and less watered-down feeling than the other brands. So if you're looking for a good organic coconut oil, this is the one.<br /><br />Now for some quick facts about how amazingly healthy this stuff is:<br /><br />1) Medium chain fatty acids --> Digest very easily without requiring the gall bladder to do much. Great for people missing gallbladders and truly everyone.<br /><br />2) Converts to usable energy very quickly. A much more balanced and less manic energy than any carbohydrate (fructose, lactose, glucose, etc)<br /><br />3) Anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal. Keeps your digestive system very clean inside. Helps destroy candida and balance intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Helps the immune system.<br /><br />4) Longer lasting energy without insulin levels being adversely affected. Fats are the cleanest burning energy for our body. Carbohydrates cause insulin levels to raise and crash, which is what creates the "eat every 3 hours" cravings that so many people this is hunger. Healthy fats, like this oil, will not affect insulin and give us much more stable energy that last longer in the body.<br /><br />5) Tastes great. Smells great.<br /><br />6) Can be used topically to make the skin very soft. Is absorbed into the skin to nourish it, unlike most cosmetic moisturizers which leave residue or cause long-term dryness by unbalancing the body's innate skin oil balance.<br /><br />7) Can be used as a sexual lubricant. Coconut oil is a natural anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial lubricant which helps keep these organs clean and reduce the spread of unwanted problem.<br /><br />8) Great for hair and can be used as a leave-on conditioner. Like it's skin use, coconut oil will not imbalance the body's natural oils.... unlike chemical-based conditioners. Plus, because coconut is anti-"everything bad" it will keep the hair clean too!<br /><br />9) Coconut oil detox cleanse. The medium-chain fatty acids make this and ideal food for detox cleanses because the energy is available with minimal digestive effort, plus all of it's anti-"everything bad" properties. The detox cleanse is a 3 to 7 day process where all carbohydrate foods are removed and coconut oil is eaten as the primary energy source (approx. 14 Tablespoons each day). The oil can be combined with organic lemon water as well. You can find the instructions by Googling "Natural News Coconut Oil Cleanse".<br /><br />Basically, coconut oil is amazing! And this brand is the best I've found so far. Enjoy!<br /><br />*** Update: I found a good website for coconut oil information and recipes. It has summaries of many studies on coconut oil.  Visit coconutdiet (dotcom)

I'm using this product as a skin softener (marvelous), hair product (so soft) and for cooking (light, tasty). Although, I have 3 different bottles for their uses. I keep them refrigerated for longevity (just a preference). I prefer the product in its solid state rather than the liquified state for use.<br /><br />Add a few drops to your lotion, use in your co-wash bottles and great when grilling foil wrapped seafoods and brush on shish kebabs and grilled veggies. Its light.<br /><br />I will remain a faithful consumer of this product.<br /><br />Nina

review/summary: Love love love this product!
review/text: I'm new to the coconut oil hype, but so far I can say the excitement is totally founded.  I haven't tried it internally yet, but the external use has been amazing.  I have keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) on my arms (upper and lower), legs, and butt (yay, me!).  I've only ever found one cream by Lush that made any difference, and it was very expensive.  Enter, coconut oil! First, you will notice that it comes as a solid (unless the temperature is above 72 degrees, then it melts, which is ok, don't panic).  You take a bit and rub it between your hands and it melts instantly.  You're going to think first: oh yuck, I'm not putting this on my body! But please do: rub it anywhere and everywhere.  You'll notice how at firstit doesn't seem to be sinking in, but if you wait about ten minutes, it will do just that.<br /><br />I should also mention I have a sensitive skin on my face, which despite proper exfoliating, sheds skin often.  I get dry patches that, when at their worst, act like burns that open and are painful.  I know, pretty gross.  I'm usually cautious about trying new products on my face because it's so sensitive.  For years I've been using Eucerin, but it's not always enough.<br /><br />I through caution to the wind and slatered my face with the coconut oil.  It felt pretty gross at first, but within ten minutes it started to sink it.  I was nervous that I would wake up in the morning with oil-induced acne, but that didn't happen.  What did happens was that it had sunk in completely and my face was the smoothest and softest I'd ever seen.  Honestly, I couldn't stop touching my face!  Of course this meant my makeup went on better, and I looked...I don't know...I guess the word is well-rested.<br /><br />Another HUGE bonus is that while the dots on my arms still look like they're there, my keratosis pilaris is all but gone!  My arms, legs, (and yes, butt) are the softest and smoothest I've ever seen them.  I can't believe this worked! As you're working the oil into your skin, don't forget to rub it into your nails and eyelashes too.  I swear my eyelashes look longer andI know my nails are definitely stronger.<br /><br />Lastly, this product is CHEAP, you really can't go wrong with it.  I have two tubs of it, one for my body and the other for my diet (the thought of using one for both grossed me out). I'll let you know how that goes.<br /><br />Anyway, consider this a five-star, two thumbs way up review!

review/summary: Miracle for Your Skin!
review/text: I bought this product after my sister gave me a sample of the coconut oil she uses, and it left my skin looking much improved after 2 1/2 years of full-time work and full-time school (plus a husband and kids) left my face broken out from stress.  Coconut oil in general is amazing!  It has cleared up about 90% of my hormonal acne and after I wash my face and use the coconut oil, my face looks so healthy, glowing, and clean.  It seems to go against all sound advice to slather oil on your face, but it really works!  My husband even uses it each night after washing, and I've really noticed a change in his skin.  I have recently been using it on my entire body and have such soft skin (elbows and knees included).<br /><br />For this particular brand of coconut oil, it doesn't seem to be much different than the sample my sister gave me (which was a different brand).  There is a good bit in the jar.  It's pretty firm, so it's a little hard to dig out at first; but once your hands warm it up a little, it softens.  I dig out a small chunk and rub it between my palms.  It melts almost instantly and is ready to rub in.  This just seems to be the right way to take care of your skin as opposed to layering chemical after chemical in hopes that something, anything will work.

review/text: I used this product as suggested for hair conditioning.  I put the oil on for two hours before washing my hair.  I also use a little before drying my hair for moisturizer.  A little goes a long ways.  One definitely does not want to use too much of this.  I wrap my hair at night in my satin head wrap and unwrap non-greasy, extremely lustrous, well moisturized.  I am African American and naturally have dry relaxed hair, but using this routine bi-weekly, I have hair that does not sound powerfully like snapping twigs when I press it between my fingers near my ears listening for dryness.  I definitely recommend this product for anyone that suffers with dry hair especially if it has been chemically treated.  It is a hair saver.  I do shed hairs as badly as I used to.  It is hair saving.

review/text: I have only been ingesting this oil and using as a moisturizer for my face, body and hair for a little over a month.  My face and body are hydrated and soft as a baby's butt.  Plus my hair is growing like a weed, soft and shiny.  My biggest thrill came last week when I walked past my entry hall mirror and noticed that the slight sagging on my jawline was firmer and I looked years younger.  When I started this Coconut Oil regimen my blood pressure was 188/92 with medication. Last week it registered 125/75 without medication.  Needless to say I am tickled at the results since deciding to take control of my health naturally and stop relying upon doctors and drugs.  My next natural health cure is switching to naturally alkaline water. I'm told that it also produces miraculous results. Does anyone know of a good brand that is at least a PH balance of 9?

review/summary: Lovely Product for Hair
review/text: I love this product, but its a little strange. When it arrived, it was completely liquid. Not exactly sure why, but it was liquid for days. I liked it better this way. As it got colder it became hard as a rock. Which makes measuring it for my hair a little more difficult, but I dont care I love it. If you are using this as a hair moisturizer this feel good hands down. My hair is Shinny for the first time ever and my scalp is moisturized without feeling like it has a pound of grease on it. its light and a little bit goes a long way. I have this on autoship, but i may skip the next order because this is gonna last! I have thick hair and a tablespoon to a tablespoon and a half goes a long long way. I do not feel this product on my head at all. Also works well on skin. I have dry patches on my face, this is a lovely light oil. My mom uses this product as well and she has think straight hair, and she loves it!<br />Warning, do not add too much to your scalp and whatever you do do not leave clumps of this product in your hair. If it is hard, let it warm up in your hand. Reason: I add it in clumps and as i went out in the sun it began to drip down my face like water. I can only liken the experience to Jerry Curl Juice. BUT i love this product!

review/summary: Don't need my eczema medication anymore
review/text: I've mostly used this coconut oil consistently on my skin for a month now. I have eczema and dry skin spots on my torso.<br /><br />So here's my review and my experience... a rant, and advice, I guess.<br /><br />You have to be pretty consistent with this stuff to see results -- if you're starting out with it, I think. I've been using this for a month at least 2 times a day, and it's in the middle of winter when my skin easily gets dry. I stopped using lotion after learning about its ineffectiveness and how it could be in fact harmful (carcinogenic from parabens and such) -- most of the conventional products anyway that we all find easily in our supermarkets.<br /><br />So I've learned that most health products they sell you don't really eliminate the problems at their roots -- mostly just symptoms, and in fact can contribute to cancer (make-up, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, laundry detergent...) This is a very clever business technique, because the customers will always be coming back for more toxic products that eliminate symptoms, but never completely eliminate the root of the customers' problems.<br /><br />I also learned that skin problems can not only be due to toxic chemicals from your conventional lotions, it can be from toxins that sit on the inside of your body from the junk food you've been ingesting -- this includes highly processed foods, toxic medications, the toxins your skin has absorbed over the years, and maybe even the polluted air you've been breathing.(I've been told by a nutritionist that many skin problems can be helped by colon cleansing and perhaps liver cleansing...).<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is that coconut oil can only do so much (at least, in my one month of experience) on the outside, it's helping just one factor out of many that would contribute to better skin health. But I'd say it's definitely better than using my prescribed topical medication which are basically steroids (betamethasone dipropionate I think). The doctor said not to use it for more than 10 days in a row (my medication), that it's bad that the skin absorbs it. *ahem* you know that doctors are not going to recommend anything other than drugs that are mostly toxic? my dermatologist was definitely giving me carcinogens, which I found out from my doctor -- so she started prescribing me steroids. that can't be good either now can it, especially when she told me that my skin shouldn't absorb too much of it?<br /><br />It's okay to absorb the coconut oil though, because it's non-toxic, nourishing for the skin, anti-fungal, anti-oxidant and can be used internally as well. So definitely, it's great for eczema. You have to be patient with it, though -- it's not harsh and strong like my steroid cream that works in minutes. The coconut oil on the first few applications within the first day or two will still leave your skin pretty dry (in my experience), but I think it's just a matter of your skin getting used to it or something. Or maybe it's a matter of getting it so that your skin is actually nourished, after all those years of using toxic malnourishing lotions.<br /><br />With acne, it's meh. I have acne on my forehead, and I learned that it's due to the oil from my hair... or, your forehead naturally produces more grease than other parts of the body. At least for me. I didn't see that big a difference with coconut oil in the past month, but I solved my acne on my forehead problem with a facial cleanse at a day spa, followed by applying organic jojoba oil on it day and night for almost a week now... and the acne's pretty much calmed down a lot.<br /><br />My face was really smooth when I consistently used the old lotions -- while I was switching to coconut oil for the first few weeks, my face was kind of dry. But now it's back to smooth, possibly even smoother.<br /><br />I bought another jar for my mom, just for general use. She used it on some sort of super itchy rash (possibly some sort of infection, I had no idea) that just wouldn't go away for months. In her experience, after applying coconut oil, her rash itched like crazy while it was greasy. But after a few days of application, it was getting better and itching less frequently. When she applied the coconut oil at night, it wouldn't wake her up anymore from the itchiness like it used to.<br /><br />I will continue to use organic extra virgin coconut oil, and stay away from toxic substances. I think I'm also going to start cooking with coconut oil as well.<br /><br />The only downside to coconut oil in my experience and/or from what I've read and researched, are:<br /><br />if you don't like the smell<br />if you're allergic<br />if you're too lazy/impatient to switch from conventional lotions to coconut oil<br /><br />Coconut oil is too good to be true. As a huge developed country we're so far removed that we had no idea that we don't really need drugs.  At least for good skin and hair and to slow the aging process, stick to organic extra virgin coconut oil. It's probably the only staple "cosmetic" product you'll ever need -- good health leads to beauty.

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: This is the brand I usually purchase at the local co-op, and I am super stoked to see it here for half of what I normally pay so I just purchased two pounds. I can go through a pound in a month because I use it to make deodorant, toothpaste, to oil pull with, as a supplement, to cook with, and as body and hair moisturizer for me and my toddler. We both have very curly hair and dry skin and this is my favorite oil to use. It does have a somewhat strong scent that smells similar to buttered popcorn, haha, but I like it. No one has ever remarked that we smell bad. A few times I've been told we smell like pastry or coconut or "something vaguely familiar" and whenever I mention popcorn usually people agree. Anyways, I love this for first aid (rashes, cuts, burns) and to fend of sickness (often I can take a TBS and oil pull and feel better within an hour). Word of caution: take it easy if you are taking this internally at first. I've thrown up from taking too much on an empty stomach before (felt better immediately after, though). The die-off from bacteria can cause you to have "detox sickness". Oh! And it helps make breastmilk richer too. I really hope it will stay at this price long enough for me to make my next order.

review/summary: amazing
review/text: I heard about coconut oil from someone on pinterest and decided to do some research on it which led me to amazon. I bought two jars of this stuff, one to keep in my kitchen for cooking,etc.  and one for personal care. About once a week I put a couple tablespoons full in a bath and wow it has done wonders for my skin. My skin is softer, I have gotten rid of most of these little bumps I had on the back of my thighs and arms. I have used it as a hair conditioner, leaving it in my hair overnight and then showering the next morning. It leaves my hair shiny and healthy. I also use it as a spread on my waffle, just a tablespoon on a whole grain waffle with some jelly, it tastes great and it good for your metabolism and health all around. it is high in saturated fat so you have to be careful but I think the good of this product out weights that. all in all I recommend it.

review/summary: Really versatile
review/text: I've been using either Nature's Way or Nutiva coconut oil for several years, and love how versatile it is.  Not only can you use it for cooking and baking (and even around the edges of bakeware or in a frying pan in place of olive oil), but you can also use it for personal care.<br /><br />To do so, I scoop some into a small container so I don't have to dip my fingers in the larger jar.  I keep the large jar in my kitchen for cooking purposes, and then small container in my bathroom, where I use it as an eye makeup remover when I have heavy makeup on, as a skin moisturizer, and as a hair treatment.  For the hair, a small amount rubbed/melted into your palms and smoothed on over hair helps with flyaways, and a larger amount rubbed in before bed or twenty minutes before washing serves as a deep treatment. (Oftentimes, I'll put it in my hair before I go workout so that the heat helps it penetrate.)  Since coconut oil is easily absorbed by the hair, it makes for a great conditioner.<br /><br />The Nature's Way brand has consistent quality and tastes very good. It's a staple item in our house.

review/summary: And to think this has always been around
review/text: I love this product soooo much; I use it on my skin after a really hot bath and it just melts into your skin. It does not leave an oilly or greasy feel behind (my skin just drinks it up) and even if I don't put it on for a day or two, it still feels like I did.<br />You can eat it cause ........ well it's food and you can cook with it bake with it. I tryed it on a spoon, it has a suttle tast of an amond joy or mounds bar. Just a hint of chocolate and toasted nuts. I also use it on my hair to keep it moist since I just discovered the trend of natrual hair and hair styles for natural hair. I stopped the relxars in 1998 but was still hardheaded about the box braids etc. My stylest finally got me to understand that less is more.so for over 10 years it's just been wash consi and flat iron. I did have color put in a year ago and it's almost grown out. But I wanted to try something diffrent that I would'nt regret later. and the blow out braid out works very well for me. The Coconut oil is organic and not something you go to a hair supplie place etc to buy. I like it cause I'm feeding my hair and body with something that is natural and good for you.<br /><br />With so many natural coconut oil products out there, how do you choose?. For me I read the reviews first and then looked at the prices and checked afew other places ( okeay one ) but I can't say where. In the end I chose this Coconut oil made by natures way. ( this is my second jar, still have not finished the first jar. Second jar is in the kitchen and the first jar is in the bathroom or bedroom. I am going to buy more and I just turned my aunti on to it. She said " My goodness, who knew and I,ve been passing by it at the food store for years".

review/text: I use this as a skin moisturizer and love the way it feels and smells!  Does a good job keeping my hands moisturized.  Need to reapply a couple times throughout the day, but it's worth the tradeoff that it's all natural without any weird chemicals, unlike the lotions you find the the personal care section.<br /><br />For those that care: this comes in a plastic jar, not glass.  Since I use it topically, I don't care that much.  But if I was eating it, there are other organic coconut oils out there that come in glass containers.

review/summary: Great for hair
review/text: Being Indian, my mom used to always put coconut oil in my hair so it is my habit to put oil in my hair at least once a week or so. The oil sold at the stores isn't pure so I decided to buy this product on amazon. I have used 2 jars so far and I am in love with it! The oil comes in solid form and then turns into a liquid once you rub it between your palms. I warm the oil in a small container, then apply it to my hair, and leave it overnight to shampoo the next day. I also use this as a skin moisturizer in the winter. I don't use this on my face because my face is tends to be sensitive and flares up even with the most "organic" products. So if you are acne prone, then I would suggest testing it out before you apply it.

review/text: I made a few orders, this one came fast and furiously first. I ordered two jars, just in case they are small. But when the package arrived, the jars are pretty big! I opened it up, and the oil smells beautifully !! The coconut oil tastes like the almond joy. I did not really buy this for cooking but for hair and skin care and it melts on the skin like butter !!! I already love it, it smells wonderful and I will continue to use it, so that way I am able to stay away from paraben- containing hair care and skin care products. If they had even larger jars, I would order them !!! Eventually I will order more even for cooking. I really would recommend this, if you have really curly hair to use it in place of hair grease. It will even last longer and it is much cheaper, cleaner and healthier in the longrun !!!<br />I recommend this product to anyone who wants to use it what natuer already has to offer.

review/summary: Fresh taste and good consistency - absorbs quickly into skin!
review/text: This coconut oil is an excellent multi-purpose product.  I have used it for cooking, broiling, eating by the spoonful and as a skin moisturizer and massage oil.<br />Last night I put a few pats of this coconut oil on salmon with a salt and herb mix.  I broiled the salmon and it tasted amazing.  The coconut oil definitely enhanced the flavor.<br />I have been using this oil for frying eggs as well.  It does not seem to burn as quickly as olive oil or butter and it also seems that less is needed for frying - probably since it's easier to use small amounts since it is in solid form.<br />This coconut oil also worked well for sauteing tofu and broccoli with Bragg's liquid unfermented soy.<br />It's also tasty on a baked potato and I find that I can skip the salt and still enjoy the flavor.  You can also add it to rice or rice and beans or french fries for a tropical splash of flavor.<br />I combined this coconut oil with olive oil to saute vegetables for a pasta dish and it worked beautifully.<br />It has mild, fresh flavor and a little seems to go a long way.<br /><br />April 19, 2012<br /><br />Still loving this coconut oil.  It tastes great so you could literally eat a spoonful or two if you were hungry and needed instant energy.<br />I packed it for a trip to Florida.  It was solid when I arrived, but liquified once I hit the warmer weather.<br />It also works great in a hot bath for instant moisturizing and it's the perfect after sun moisturizer.  It smells so good that you could use it as a very mild perfume and moisturizer just by rubbing it into your arms and legs until the oil is absorbed - seriously!

review/summary: Fantastic for hair.  OK for dry skin
review/text: My hair LOVES coconut oil, apparently.  I have been using a small amount in my hair after I wash and towel-dry my hair for the past 3 weeks, and my normally fine, dry hair is noticeably healthier.  It's not as frizzy and dry.  The coconut oil is actually changing my hair condition instead of just sitting on the surface of my hair and making it look glossy.<br /><br />I have tried some pretty expensive products in my hair ($20-$30 conditioners, hot oil treatments, etc.), and all I can say is, I am never going back.  My advice is to be patient with it, it's not an overnight cure, but your hair will definitely feel great over time.<br /><br />I also have pretty dry skin, but the oil seems to provide only minimal moisture for my cracked skin.  I'm sure it's great for normal skin, though.

review/text: I first came across Alwazah Tea while on my second tour to Iraq.  Some of the local merchants sold packages to the US Troops in the bazaar, and I found the flavor to be very similar to the teas served by the sheiks in the area.  Later on, I became attached to a Joint Operations Center and continued using Alwazah to make connections and build up a repertoire with my Jundi counterparts in the Iraqi Army.  This is about as close as it gets to actual Middle Eastern chai available stateside.

review/text: I originally found this tea in a store in Nashville, TN, but have since moved.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to find it in any of my local stores.  This tea is worth the effort of ordering when unavailable locally.<br /><br />It has an excellent taste, particularly for those who enjoy the non-bagged variety.  You simply heat water in a kettle and once it begins to boil, take it off the heat.  Put a spoon full or two inside it to steep (depending on amount of water used).  A few minutes later and it is ready to go.  I recommend using a small stainer to pour the tea through and into your cup.<br /><br />For a comparison, I would say Al Wazah tastes similar to Earl Grey, but a bit richer in taste.

They are melt-in-your-mouth good!!!  And, I love their nugget size - I can choose to eat just 1 or 2 nuggets to indulge my cravings, without increasing my pants size (or I can choose to eat a whole handful, and forget about my pants size - smile).<br /><br />Although I still love Dove dark chocolate, these Hershey's nuggets allow me to enjoy the combination of chocolate & almonds that I love - as I haven't found this combination in the Dove brand - and I've found them to be just as good.

review/summary: Authentic Austrian Taste
review/text: I am so excited to find these on Amazon, for a decent price and with free shipping for Amazon Prime members.  These are made in Austria.  They come in several flavors, but hazelnut is a traditional European, particularly German/Austrian flavor.  It is used in a lot of dishes.  These are yummy.  My Austrian mom used to buy these for my sister and I when we were kids.  When my kids and I were in Austria 6 years ago and in Germany 2 years ago we devoured these whenever we could find them.  Now we can get them any time on Amazon.  I think I will buy them around the holidays!  I recommend these.  They are traditional, authentic and delicious!

review/summary: A light confection
review/text: The 2.54 ounce package is too big to use as an individual serving, but contains 10 individual wafers that must be carefully broken apart.  The small individual wafers are perhaps a confection that you would serve with coffee.  They are multilayered wafers - I am reviewing the hazlenut cream filled - which form a light, flavorful treat.  I would not recommend them for an individual dessert, but perhaps they could be used as teatime treats for afternoon social functions.  They packages have a pull tab, somewhat like you find on packages of chewing gum, etc., for ease of opening.  The package indicates five of the small wafers as a serving size, but I think that would be too much.  They are quite filling.

review/summary: great flavor for cooking
review/text: I ordered the extract to make rose ice cream, because you can rarely find it.  The ice cream turned out really great with this flavoring.  I used 1 1/4 teaspoons to flavor about 3 cups of ice cream.  It was a very light and perfect flavor.  You can definetly use more for a stronger taste.  The seller was also very quick with the shipping.
