review/summary: A Texas must
review/text: This is the soda I grew up on, that and Dr Pepper. Has a great taste and nothing says Texas better than Big Red. Instead of Root Beer Floats, we had Big Red Floats, ten times better! Just have a sip of it and it will take you back to when you were a kid with no cares in the world.

review/summary: Awesome vanilla-y taste
review/text: I'm a big fan of this soda. There is a local restaurant that sells it (Texas BBQ style) and it is so good! Bright red, tastes like vanilla with a very light cherry taste. I see others describe it as bubblegum taste but I don't think it tastes like bubblegum. Its more like vanilla cream with just a hint of fruit. This drink is a must taste! Too bad we can't get it here in California grocery stores! Awesome!

review/summary: Uniquely delicious
review/text: It was quite a thrill for me to suddenly find cartons of Big Red sitting on the shelves of a local mega-large retailer a few months ago.  I had never heard of Big Red until one of my college roommates brought some to school with him (and that has been some years ago).  At the time, I found the bubble gum taste interesting, but I didn't get a large enough sample of it to really know whether I liked it or not.  Then, several years later, some Big Red magically appeared in a local convenience store, and that is when I grew to love it.  Alas, the stuff soon disappeared off of this store's refrigerated shelves, leaving me to wonder if I would ever enjoy this unique soda drink again.  This may be a Southern product dating all the way back to 1937, but few folks here in North Carolina have ever heard of the stuff.  Maybe that will begin to change now - as long as the Big W keeps it on the shelves.  Some folks are bound to try it, if for no other reason than the price, which is significantly cheaper than all of the well-known colas.  In my opinion, the carton and bottle designs (as well as the price) actually make this look like a knock-off, discount product.  We all know how nasty those knock-off colas taste, so don't let yourself be fooled into thinking that Big Red isn't worth a try.  This stuff is all kinds of good.  It is reportedly available in 43 states now, so keep an eye out for it - or just order some from this site.<br /><br />There is one issue you need to be aware of, though.  Big Red will turn your mouth red.  That includes the lips, so guys who drink this stuff should probably take a look at themselves in the mirror before heading out for a night on the town with their buddies - unless you want to take the chance of a lipstick joke or two thrown your way.  If I drink it at night, I have to wash off my lips inside and out to avoid waking up to a pillow sporting various red stains the next morning.  It's a small price to pay, though, for something that tastes as good as Big Red.

review/text: I love red cream soda... not the plain cream soda.  Red Cream soda can be hard to find so I went looking online and found this - and tried it a few times.  I love it!!  Its worth the extra cost in shipping.  I tried the diet big red too and loved it (and I'm not a diet drink fan).  Also, some red cream sodas are too "syrupy" or too sweet...this Big Red is just right.

review/summary: ONE OF THE BEST DRINKS OF ALL TIME
review/text: BIG RED<br /><br />This is one of my all time favorite drinks of all time and to be honest when it comes to cokes, soda, pop or what ever you want to call it I doubt there is much out there that can top this. I was born in Texas and once again as off 5 or 6 years ago I made way back here and could not have been happier to have this drink at my disposal once again. For many many years while living on the East Coast namely Maryland were this drink is not available all I could do was bring some back with me after visits to family back in the Lone Star State.<br /><br />If you want to be specific this is a cream soda, a red cream soda to be exact. But to all those saying I am not a fan of cream soda I assure you that red cream soda has a much different taste as compared to just cream soda. This wonderful drink that comes out of Waco Texas is really one of the most refreshing soft drinks I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. For all you calorie nuts out there this does have 150 worth per can of it but if you watch your intake this could be a wonderful luxury drink as my grandmother says about the Vanilla Float version of Big Red.<br /><br />If you ever come across this drink any were or order drinks from the net I highly recommend it, even if you only drink these type of drinks every so often you should at least try it. My best friend from Maryland came with me to Texas a couple of times and after trying this drink he is hooked. It is important for you to know that the guy is a mixed martial artist and does not really drink soft drinks; this would be his luxury drink.

review/summary: Bonsai Bare Branches
review/text: I got this gardenia bonsai in mid-February and it is not as I expected. Upon opening the package, the leaves are dull green, no buds, dried out and mostly dark brown. I followed the instruction and even did some research work through the internet. I even bought extra stuffs like plant food, cool mist humidifier just to revive the plant. Well now, after 3 weeks, 90% of the leaves are gone, branches bare, looks like those bare trees that you see during winter. I tried to contact the merchant and ask for advise, but I did not get any response. I have other bonsais and regular gardenias that are healthy and I really wanted this gardenia bonsai so bad.

review/summary: Bug Infested
review/text: I'm always hesitant to write a negative review because tastes are different but with this product I felt I had a duty to alert consumers.  I bought this and out of the box it was pretty until I looked close and found it was infested with tiny white bugs that clung to nearly every branch and leaf.  I hoped they would die on their own but after three weeks they were still there and the plant itself had started to die.  I bought plant insect spray and they killed the bugs.  The plant died two weeks later.  I was very disappointed since I'd always wanted a bonsai tree and gardenia is my favorite scent.

review/summary: Falling leaves
review/text: I ordered this bonsai tree for my daughter-in-law because she listed it on her Amazon wish list as "highest" for this Christmas 2005.  The order came in record time, three weeks before Christmas so I set about babying the tree each day by following all of the directions to a tee!  I sprayed it and watered it  exactly as the directions stated and I placed it in a sunny well lighted area and the temperature in our condo was never below 65 degrees and that was only at night while we slept. Nonetheless, after two weeks, still a week before Christmas, the leaves began to curl, turn splotchy and fall off. I was very sad about this because the tree had looked wonderful when it arrived and it was very well packed.  But, by the time Christmas Eve arrived it had only about half of its original leaves.  We are now waiting to see if the tree does better at my daughter-in-law's home since she is very happy to have it and she'd love to keep it...she is going to try to nurture it into a healthy life.  We'll see...  M. Buchanan

Although there are some bad reviews about this item, i still decided to give it a try.<br />and I am so glad that I did!<br /><br />I have used a 2 days shipping just to make sure the plant won't be stuck in the box for too long. It arrived on time.<br /><br />The package is really well packed. the soil is nice and moisture when it is arrived, as the pot part was wrapped carefully in a plastic bag. ALL the leaves are green! This is much better than i have expected. I thought couple yellow and dropping leaves were understandable as it has been moved around. But i guess they have exceeded my expectation. No single dropping leaf or yellow leaf at all.<br /><br />I saw 2 flowers already, and it smells fantastic and gorgeous!<br /><br />I am completely satisfied with the order.

review/text: Plant ordered 12/12/2011 Like the others I was very skeptical ordering this plant due to there being many negative reviews, but my mom loves gardenias so I decided to give this a try anyways for christmas. I used 2 day shipping and as ordered the plant arrived in 2 days exactly. Opening the box I was ready for the worst but to my surprise i opened the top and all I could see was tons of little green leaves!! This plant is seriously amazing about 6-8 inches tall and looks like its ready to flower with tons of branches and leaves. The packaging job was amazing all the soil was still together, no broken branches and came with a how to care booklet. I am 100% satisfied with this order!<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: If you are going to order dont be cheap and spend the extra $15 on 2 day shipping. I believe that really makes a difference in the condition your plant will arrive in. if you pay for regular ground shipping your plant is going to sit in a box for 1-2 weeks can you really expect it to show up in healthy condition?

Unfortunately, when it was shipped to South Dakota around Christmastime, the state was experiencing extremely cold temperatures.  Only packing peanuts were used for insulation, and the plant died.  Restrictions should be placed on shipping these type of products to cold climates or packing material that provides better insulation should be used.

The only thing it seems to attract is bugs.  We finally had to put it outside because it was getting pretty bad.  I think its still alive, but not sure how much longer it has.

review/summary: Good packaging, nice plant
review/text: I'm skeptical of the "helpful" reviews here with such low marks. I purchased this plant as a Mother's Day gift and my mom has had nothing but success with it. They aren't supposed to flower for a year or two after you get them (due to the adjustments they need to the climate and your particular (bad?) watering habits), but she got the plant to flower twice in one year. I think a key to this was keeping it outside during our nice, sunny Minnesota days, and then bringing it inside again each and every night. Adding the correct fertilizer in the correct amount is important.<br /><br />Bonsai aren't necessarily easy, but this one has done well. That's my experience anyway.<br /><br />Also, I was impressed with the packaging - securely shipped and eco-friendly. And the flowers smell absolutely wonderful!

review/text: So it came with beautiful greens and full of flowers.  Was really optimistic, no instructions - i.e. how old is it? After the flowers died, it got fleas, which are soil related. It bugged my other plants. However, its a cutting of a shrub, not a bonsai. Its just stuck in a bonsai pot. Now I'm in the bug spraying mode- frustrating. It would have been easier to care for it as a plant, since its buggy. Now I have to train it into a bonsai. It seems root bound, but we're not supposed to anything the first year. Gardenias are hardy but delicate so I'm frustrated with spraying for bugs and for the season I have to bring it in and I hate bugs.

review/summary: Great Gardenia Bonsai
review/text: The Bonsai came pretty healthy looking with the majority of leaves being nice and green (only a couple were yellowing) and with many buds ready to open.  I watered it as directed and gave it a little fertilizer to help improve the yellowing leaves.  It did improve and it bloomed profusely.  I think it is natural for it to drop some leaves as it acclimates to it's new environment.  The flowers are now starting to fade away with the season for gardenia plants.  I have noticed some new growth already with new leaves which means the plant is growing and is still healthy.  I would recomend this plant to others who do not mind giving plants some extra attention.

review/summary: Gardenia Bonsai
review/text: I will admit, I was very hesitant buying this after reading the 3 negative reviews on the main item page description, but I ordered it anyways, I always wanted a flowering bonsai as I only have had the pleasure of having regular bonsais. But when I received, it was extremely healthy and taken care of. Only 3 leaves needed to be trimmed due to discoloration from being inside the box. I know it will take time to flwoer and won't expect it right away. My only concern is that the potting soil is not what I expected. I expected it to be softer and easier like the soil is supposed to be with bonsais, but instead it was regular soil with wood and rock in it. When I got to transplant it later on, I will be fixing that for sure because I want it to grow up healthy.<br />But it's growing quite well and nothing was broken or dead. It was shipped out the next day and arrived at my house 3 days later. The other negative reviews probably had their shipping take longer and that is why the leaves were dissatisfying.<br />Awesome work on this little guy, I would buy from you again. :)

review/summary: came complete or did it?
review/text: This gardenia tree looked so cute online and we love gardenias. It arrived with a note to hurry and purchase a tray to go under the pretty pot which has 2 draining holes. It was a surprise this was not included. The plant did however come complete with ectoparasites (something like green scales clinging to the branches) and white flies. It was also not as mature as shown in photo - more like 3 branches with scant green and yellow leaves.

review/text: I was a bit hesitant about ordering this because of the mixed reviews.  However, the good seemed to outweigh the bad and this just looked like something my mother would like so I ordered it.  Ever the procrastinator, I ordered this for Mother's Day.  As I ordered it on a Wednesday (the 9th), I knew it wouldn't make it in time...SURPRISE - even though the The estimated date was the 15th (the following Tues), it actually arrived on the 11th in plenty of time for Mother's Day.  My mom called and told me it was gorgeous with lotzzz of flowers.  I asked her about the leaves, size, etc., all the warnings from some of the bad reviews and she said it was in perfect shape and she LOVED it.

review/summary: Tree or Bush
review/text: The plant came very well packaged & very fast.It came with two flowers on it, smelled so good. I know the gardenia is an indoor plant, but it started showing some yellow leaves,(I live on the west coast)so I put it outside where it get some early morning sun, no afternoon sun.It is doing very well!! In the winter we will bring it in. As for the pictue of the plant I saw on line and the one I recived are very differnt. Mine is more of a bush than a tree. But the price was only $31.00 and this is a bonsai so I can train it anyway I want. I am looking forward to putting my touch on this tree.

I recommend them for small dogs, a big dog would probably demolish one in 2 seconds.  Keeps my guys<br />busy for about 20 minutes.

review/summary: Unenchanted
review/text: Product received quickly but unfortunate it gave my dog diarrhea after one lambs ear.  After waiting several days I tried again with same results.  Returned the lambs ears, placed an order for more lambs ears with a name brand that she had eaten before.  I went through the same company so they still got a sale.  Wish I had of waited before ordering.  I received a credit minus 6 missing lambs ears.  Since I had only taken two from the box, I figured I must have been shorted to begin with.  Meanwhile I paid shipping two ways and had a vet bill for $225.00 because the dog had to be put on antibiotics to clear up the diarrhea.

It would be nice if it came with a list of what the flavors are...<br />Oops- just noticed that this is $40 for 2 boxes. I think it's good enough to be $20. :)

review/text: I've always been a fan of Figs, and these are the best I've tasted.  I don't like the dates and apricots as much but even if I could buy the Figs by itself, I'd probably still go for this mixed pack since it becomes a snack with a bit more variety and texture.  The figs are very soft with an odd crispness to the outside, while the other items are much more chewy.  Watch out for the small seeds though!

On the bag in small print at the bottom it said they were manufactured in a facility with wheat and dairy.  The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status.  Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.<br /><br />Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only.  That way they can charge more for the product.

The outside cookie is delicious but only after removing the sugar disc.  After receiving the first order, I contacted Amazon and complained that the cookies did not have the creamy center as stated in the cookie product description.  Amazon immediately sent a replacement but the second order was exactly the same as the first.  I contacted Mi-Del through their website email and asked if the cream center was supposed to be hard.  Mi-Del did not answer my question but sent a coupon for my next purchase.

I put them in the blender to chop them up, then mix in a bowl with melted butter.  I spray my pie dish with non-stick spray before pressing it in the plate.  My family likes it as a crust for chocolate pie, but I've used them with others also and it turns out great.  I've never used them for baking pies so I can't recommend that, only for no-bake pies, cheesecakes, etc.

review/text: These are some of the best mass-produced gluten-free cookies I have found.  (Never mind the gluten-free part -- most people could never tell that these ginger snaps are not made with wheat flour.)  They've got great snap and just the right amount of gingery heat.  When crushed and combined with a few other choice ingredients, they make a fantastic pie or dessert crust.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Well, I've bought these ginger snaps many times at the grocery store, and never have I had so many broken cookies as in the box that Amazon sent.  The box itself showed no signs of damage, so I'm a bit puzzled as to what transpired in the Amazon warehouse or in transit.  All in all, however, I love the cookies and am pleased with the Amazon price.  I'll be ordering these again.

review/text: We buy this type of product because of a health condition. We ordered these cookies fully expecting them to arrive in a some what good condition. Instead all we received was crumbs and partial cookies, there were very few whole cookies. I suspect the lack of care in the packaging was one of the main problems.

review/summary: Ginger snaps are okay but I've had better.
review/text: I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least "gluten-free" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good "bite" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally.

review/summary: My Kids Devour These Cookies
review/text: "Oreos" are America's favorite cookie. Frankly, I've never understood the fascination. But my kids sure do! They devour these cookies. I have tried them myself, and they are very similar to the gluten-containing version. But the important thing is that my kids love them and don't have to feel like they are missing out on a vital part of American childhood!

review/summary: Delicious Gluten Free Ginger Snaps From Amazon
review/text: I am on a gluten free diet and enjoy the ginger snaps as a snack.  My cookie jar is often empty as my husband loves to eat them too. We have bought them at major grocery and health food stores. It is wonderful to have fresh ones delivered.  The next order is for 2 boxes a month but then one box a month until winter.  I must try them in cooking:  sauerbraten or pie filling.  They are very tasty and great with tea or coffee.  I receive the MI-Del Ginger Snaps from Amazon.

review/text: I received a basket of gluten free items for Christmas and these Midel cookies were included.  These cookies tasted just like Oreo's and, so far, they are the best gluten free cookies that I have found!  I do not understand why anyone would give them a bad review.  I am glad that we received them as a gift---we just love them!

review/text: The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The "chocolate" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as "bite-size," they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers.

review/summary: Gluten free, really? They taste AMAZING!!
review/text: Finding gluten free products that taste decent is a challenge and I bought a box of these cookies expecting them to taste "good" but still, with an off taste from being gluten free. Wow, was I wrong! These cookies are amazing!! They are shaped like animals, light, crunchy, buttery, and a hint of lemon. These are hands down the best cookies I've had in my life, including "regular" cookies, and this is the first time I can actually say a gluten free item tastes better than its gluten counterpart.<br /><br />My WalMart sells these for 3.38/bag and I got them here for a bit over 2.00/bag with subscribe and save. This will definitely be a staple in our household! We've eaten an entire bag in less than 24 hours. Nobody could ever guess that these cookies are gluten free, they are AMAZING!!

review/summary: Sometimes, they will gluten you.
review/text: I love this company and what they are trying to do.  However, when I first got my celiac diagnosis, though, I got glutened by these.<br /><br />A couple of years passed.  The buzz on the celiac boards was that Mi-Del had really cleaned up their act, and that their cookies were safe.  From about 2004-2009, I ate these without incident.  I even figured out how to make cookie pie crusts in them and put the recipe in my gluten-free cookbook.  Then, I got a bad batch two times in a row, and got glutened again.<br /><br />Maybe they have problems with suppliers?  I understand they've been a lot more careful with the actual manufacturing process.<br /><br />It's sad, but I would buy Pamela's ginger cookies (available on Amazon!) instead.

review/text: We love these cookies, better than "K" vanilla.  My husband is not gluten free, and this is his favorite cookie too.  Yes, they are a crisp cookie (some may call hard), but that is why I like them.  They have a rich vanilla flavor which the "K" cookies do not. I carry these in my purse when when we are dining out so I have a gluten free dessert, restaurants never mind this.  For chocolate, we still like the "K" chocolate the best. Note: I use the auto delivery every 6 month for a better price.
