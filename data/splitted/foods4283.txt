review/text: I believe you are supposed to add this salt when popping but it works just as well putting it on after being popped. I don't like the mess it leaves in the pan after popping, so we add it after popping. It sticks to the popcorn fine.

review/summary: salt yes, but with flavor!
review/text: I love this special popcorn salt! I have made popcorn several times in the past 2 days. I am now making popcorn in my microwave, and don't plan to buy packaged microwave popcorn again. I haven't bought coconut oil yet, but I plan to, next trip to grocery store. But this popcorn is great already with the Flavacal popcorn salt.<br />The reviewer who said it was just salt is wrong, it adds a great flavor to popcorn. It beats the taste of 'movie' popcorn to me. I poured about 3/4 of it into a large shaker, to make it more convenient to use. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who wants wonderful tasting popcorn. Love it, love it, love it!!

review/text: A little bit goes a long way and this has a perfect flavor.  We pop our popcorn in our Whirly Pop popper (in coconut oil) and then place the popcorn in a bag and add the tiny bit of flavoring per the directions on the package, and shake.  What results is so delicious that there is never a single piece left.  There is probably enough in this carton to last a year if we made popcorn constantly - and I'm very ok with that considering the cheap price.

review/summary: You need this!
review/text: If you're really into movie-theater tasting popcorn, this is absolutely necessary. Its gives the saltiness and artificial butter taste to your popcorn that can't be had using actual butter and regular salt. Keep in mind, this stuff isn't healthy, though neither is using regular salt and butter...but at least you don't have the fat from the butter, just lots of sodium as would be expected anytime you're making anything salty. Coconut oil should also be used if possible, though that stuff isn't exactly healthy either. Overall, if you're on the fence about whether or not you should buy it, just give it a shot...its not that expensive and you can probably find a friend or family member that will gladly take it off your hands if you don't like it yourself. If you do like it, this enough to last a looooong time and still have extra to give to friends to try. Great product at a great price.

review/text: Ordered yesterday, received today (Thanks Amazon/Amazon Prime!), and made my first batch of popcorn within minutes of receiving.<br /><br />I've used the Act II Butter Flavored Popcorn Salt for years.  Not that I didn't know about Flavacol, but that it was the only thing I could find locally.  I figured it was the same stuff just marketed by a different company.  Boy was I wrong!  While the Act II is good, this stuff is FAR better with a much better butter flavor.  I find that the Act II tastes more salty/less buttery than this.<br /><br />Use this along with coconut oil and you have movie theater popcorn at home.  If you eat a lot of popcorn like I do, this is a must-have!!!

review/text: Flavacol seasoning popcorn salt makes a nice complement. I like to still make popcorn the old fashioned way. This salt eliminates trying to determine how much salt to shake into the popped corn in the bowl. I suggest not using as much as the directions state. It really is salty. A little goes a long way. To make the corn healthier I cook in extra virgin olive oil. Add the Flavacol and corn and start popping. Tastes great!

review/summary: Something more than just NaCl
review/text: Our household consumes very little salt as such (other than the salt that is included in other substances such as soy sauce).  For the "big jobs" (brining a turkey, for example), we use Diamond Kosher salt, but for SEASONING we have for the past decade or so used only Belamandil Flor de Sal.  Where taste is the paramount criterion, we have found no equal to Portuguese Flor de Sal.<br /><br />As with other sea salts where the place of harvesting is specifically designated, such as Fleur de Sel from the region around Nantes, France, or Maldon salt from Britain, or Trapani salt from Sicily, it is the components of the salt that are not sodium chloride (NaCl) that distinguish Flor de Sal from other seasoning salts.  Although nothing has been added by human hands to the Flor de Sal that has been harvested from the ocean, at least four percent of Belamandil Flor de Sal comprises minerals that are not NaCl, and that four percent makes all the difference.  In case your mind's eye conjures visions that the non-NaCl component is the garbage that you may have seen dumped into the Mediterranean, put your fears to rest.  The coast of the Algarve region of Portugal, where Belamandil Flor de Sal is harvested, is on the Atlantic side of the Straits of Gibraltar, a part of a very large and self-healing Atlantic Ocean ecosystem.<br /><br />Also, like the French Fleur de Sel, the Portuguese Belamandil Flor de Sal is only the "flower" of the salt, skimmed from surface blooms, rather than, as many sea salts are, evaporated from large quantities of sea water that have been scoured from varying depths of the ocean.  Flor de Sal's surface blooms have been exposed to direct unfiltered sunshine (they disappear in rainstorms), a natural purifying process.  The process causes the salt to form small thin wafers rather than clumpy amorphous granules, and that shape causes the Flor de Sal to have a tactile but quickly yielding crunch that is very different from chomping down on grains of ordinary table salt.<br /><br />As gourmet foods go, Flor de Sal is a great bargain.  For the price of only enough gasoline for a very few days of an urban commute to work, you can buy more than a full pound of Flor de Sal, which will go a LONG way.  You will enjoy the Flor de Sal much more than the commute, I guarantee you.

review/summary: Flor de Sal, the cream of salt from Portugal
review/text: Fleur de Sel, known in Portugal as Flor de Sal, is hand-harvested, in the Algarve region of Portugal. During the harvest process, the first layer produces the finest and most mineral-rich crystals, to ultimately be used, not during the cooking process, but to season dishes prior to serving. Flor de Sal is used to greatest effect with simple dishes and foods that will accentuate its unique sweet and creamy flavor. In days gone by, Portuguese salt workers referred to Flor de Sal as "salt cream," as it was (and is still) collected from the salt pan (salina) surface as cream is from the milk). The second (called Gray Salt) and subsequent layers are coarser and less pure in flavor and color. These subsequent layers, however, still produce hand-harvested sea salt, as with our Sal Marinho Tradicional. These salts are superior to processed salts in terms of purity and taste.<br /><br />The taste difference between Flor de Sal and lower grades of salt can be compared to the difference between pure, high-grade maple syrup and corn-syrup-based artificial pancake syrups. Most people who have tried maple syrup never want to go back to eating the artificial syrups because the real maple syrup has a subtle and rich flavor, which artificial syrups totally lack. Likewise, Flor de Sal has a rich, creamy, sweet flavor (and melts on your tongue). It also contains trace minerals needed for good health such as magnesium, iron, calcium and potassium.

review/text: Unfortunately, I am very disappointed by this product. I sent these to my mother-in-law as a birthday gift, and while she was very happy to receive it, she also politely told me that the chocolate-covered pretzels were not fresh. They had already spoiled, with the chocolate having bloomed (i.e. has that whitish powdery look and is grainy) and the pretzels themselves tasting very stale. To call this box "gourmet" is just an egregious lie - all items are basically purchased in bulk items that you usually get at the candy isle in a cheap drugstore. I am very angry about this! Obviously these boxes have sat for a LONG time and no one cares enough to take a look and see that the chocolate isn't looking fresh. I would not recommend anyone to buy these as a gift or even for themselves.

review/summary: Not good, not good at all.
review/text: When I got my basket I couldn't believe it was so old and beyond staleness that they actually sent it that way.  Everything in the basket was a WASTE OF MONEY.  Nothing I've got was no good, not good at all, you couldn't eat any of it. But prepared by a national known chocolate company Ghirardelli that supposed to be great chocolate, it doesn't surprise me they don't even check to see if it's any good to eat anyway.just to save money.  It only reenforces one thing for me when it comes to chocolate: stick to Hershey's, at least they give a damn.

review/text: I am not going to rant. What I will say, is that the picture is bigger than the items they send out. You do not get your moneys worth and they are packaged up in a horrid fashion. They were told my items were a hift but that did not stop them from sending it as if it were just some half assed shipment to a warehouse. I am disgusted, I feel cheated and I am embarrassed that my family thinks I went the cheap route again. Fact is, I purchased three separate arrangements to have delivered and they barely looked as if they could feed one person. I am horrified that Amazon allows these people to sell on their site.

review/summary: Excellent tomatoes, in spite of the can!
review/text: My wife and I used to buy this item at the local niche grocery store, which unfortunately stopped carrying it. We were ecstatic to see that the other viable alternative was through amazon.com, which now had the added luxury of having these heavy cans delivered to our door with free super saver shipping!<br /><br />These tomatoes are great when creating a tomato-based pasta sauce; our recipe includes simmering in vodka. Great flavor without the buzz. Or with the buzz, if we set the simmer time for a little less. Anyways, somehow, the canning helps create the taste we're looking for, which we had a hard time replicating with fresh tomatoes.<br /><br />The price on this item tends to fluctuate on amazon, so we just buy when it trends down.

review/text: My family loves Greek salads and fish (and we are Irish!) because they are low in fat and healthy.  When one of my sons started cooking for himself in college he requested Cavenders Greek seasoning to make dinner as we made at home. This seasoning makes dishes taste better than just salt and pepper. My son told me he even puts it on steaks and his roommate has taken to using it on everything. It is hard to find in certain regions and the price was right. Delivery was quick.

review/text: I used Cavenders Greek seasoning for the first time several years ago when my sister sent me 2-8 oz. containers as part of a birthday gift.  It is one of the best, most useful and prolific gifts I have ever received.  I use this seasoning on chicken, beef, pork and seafood dishes and in soups and stews as well.  This is one of the best seasonings I have ever used.  I refuse to cook without it.  I suggest that everyone who wants to pump up the flavor of their foods try this seasoing and like me you will make it a staple in your household.

review/summary: Awesome popcorn!
review/text: I have been a fan of the Naturals popcorn since it came out.  My first try was with the Lime & Salt flavor (also an awesome flavor, but sadly discontinued).  Then one day I found the Salt & Black Pepper popcorn.  Talk about AWESOME!  I love black pepper and this popcorn has it.  There is pleny in each bag to give you the spicy pepperiness that you expect.  The mini bags are great because I can snack on them at work and not be too much.  My only complaint is that a lot of the pepper sticks to the bag itself, but you still get plenty of flavor.

review/summary: pretty good tasting, doesn't cook well in my microwave
review/text: I like the flavor of this popcorn. It's a little on the salty side, but just right with the butter and pepper flavor. For some reason, these small bags don't do so well in my microwave. I set it for the recommended 1:30 on high and still get a few burned popped pieces and a handful of unpopped kernels. If I cook it for less time, I get an unacceptable number of unpopped kernels, and any longer, too many burned popped pieces. I also tried the "popcorn" setting and get the same result as 1:30 on high. I don't have any problems with the regular sized bags of buttered flavor popcorn.

review/summary: PARTY in your mouth! So Yummy
review/text: The pepper is real crushed pepper pieces and if you like salt and pepper, like TRULY are a fan then, you will be scraping your pinky nail trying to get the last little bit. I was teaching a week of intersession classes with some younger kids. Everyday we made our own snacks, Creative Cooking. On that Friday we had movie day with of course you guessed it, POPCORN! I didn't want the buttery yucky chemical junk and I also wanted to mix our local Hawaiian popcorn. I picked up one box of these from the Walmart to add to the mix. Honestly I didn't realize it would be so much pepper. The kids still loved it. No one complained that it was spicy. However our popcorn mix had all kinds of things like pretzels and cereal, we used all our leftovers from the week.... Just saying this can be a big hit even with kids. Now, Im buying Amazon Prime's 12 pack for right under thirty bucks, which will save me six dollars vs Walmart's price.<br /><br />Conclusion: May not be for everyone but a group of 13 little keiki all said "thumbs up". Including me that's 28 thumbs up!

review/text: Redenbacher's popcorn has always been good stuff, but I've never really looked for anything besides butter flavored.  Then I found these.  I'm a fan of black pepper, especially on things like potato chips, and if you enjoy snacks like that you'll love this popcorn.  The salt & pepper combination is unique and very tasty without being overpowering.  The only downside is it seems like a lot of seasoning gets left behind in the bag, but that's one of the perils of microwave popcorn.  It may work out better with the regular sized bags, but I've still got a few snack sized boxes left so I'm just speculating.

Well I liked it so much and completely more than any other kind of microwave popcorn I'd ever tried since the invention of microwave popcorn, I started telling people about it.  I don't do that for products unless I'm really impressed (this is my first review of any food item ever).  I'm 50 years old too so that should tell you how long I've waited for a microwave popcorn to tell the world about.  My oldest son loved it so much he told his friends and they now only buy this type of popcorn.  Like father, like son.<br /><br />Buy it, eat it, love it, tell the world!

review/summary: Best Popcorn Ever!
review/text: I specifically ordered a case of this popcorn because I had received a free sample and absolutely loved it!  It is the best popcorn I have ever eaten and highly recommend it.  I had wanted to get it at our local Walmart, but they were out and when I found it on amazon.com, I had to order it ;0)  I prefer the peppery taste to the salty taste by far.

review/summary: WOW! Surprisingly yummy!
review/text: I got a free sample of this in the mail and the very next day I had to run out and get more! Who would have thought a little cracked pepper could make popcorn taste this good! After a few handfuls I could feel a tinge of heat from the pepper on my tongue which I loved. I will admit it is a little salty and oily. I have also tried the other natural popcorn from Orville including buttery garlic (which could use more garlic in my opinion) and hint of salt but this flavor takes the cake! Wish it came in a bigger bag also at my local supermarket a box goes for $3.99 which I think is overpriced!

review/summary: Love this Popcorn
review/text: We found this in a local store and couldn't believe how awesome it tasted with the black pepper. I would not have guessed such a simple thing would make such a huge difference. Unfortunately our local store no longer carries it so we delighted when I found it in bulk through Amazon. I love that the bags are small single-serve snack bags, not a lot wasted if you just want a salty/savory snack. They pop quickly and taste amazing. Everyone at my work is jealous when I pop some as a snack. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Love the Peppery Taste!
review/text: As an avid popcorn eater, I try new tastes that tweak my curiosity when they come on the market.  When I saw the description of buttery salt and cracked pepper I couldn't resist purchasing.  This popcorn is wonderful!  It has just enough cracked pepper that lets you know it's present without being overwhelming.  The buttery salt companion taste is perfectly blended in for a delicious overall flavor.  I use popcorn as a snack for watching my weight and having the mini packs is another bonus with this product.  Orville Redenbacher has done it again!  And am I ever glad they have!

review/text: Bag size is perfect for one big portion or sharing with a friend, although you might each want your own bag of this popcorn. It's lightly buttered, just the right amount of salt and the pepper gives the popcorn a little 'bite', just a little bit of heat. I'm very pleased with this product!

review/summary: Best Popcorn Ever
review/text: Recommended by a friend...tried it.  It is now my favorite snack.  I believe the small bags are only two Weight Watchers points.  Also, it is nearly $4 for a box at the grocery store, but if you choose the option to get it auto-sent on a regular basis (it can be every three months to get the same price), the case price goes down to $20 and change.  So the box price is less than half what you pay at the grocery store.  I was hesitant about buying popcorn by the case, but as you can see, I'm a big fan now.  My husband was a huge butter popcorn fanatic, but he has come over to the peppercorn side now, too.  Enjoy!

review/text: I have eaten these since the 1960's, and they have been my favorite chocolate bar.<br /><br />The bar is unlike any other chocolate bar I know - it's a sort of light/whipped chocolate inside, that is a consistency unlike others. It's moderately firm but soft; the closest I can think of is like the peanut butter filling of Reese's. It has a normal chocolate coating. The chocolate filling is closer to a milk than dark flavor, but not quite either. It's not 'chewy' but melts.<br /><br />If I were getting just one standard chocolate bar, I think it would be this one.

review/summary: Best microwave popcorn. Not like other "kettle corns"
review/text: To put is simply, it ruins you for other popcorns.<br /><br />We tried some of this on a whim from our local Costco once. It is amazing. Even though there is great care needed to pop it just the right amount of time (the sugary stuff burns quickly), it is so very, very worth it. As others have said, it's like the fresh kind made in a kettle. It's no sweet flavored popcorn, it actually has the sweet/salty coating on the popped kernels. Delicious. Much like others, I have bought and split a case with another family before. it was gone in a flash.<br /><br />In my opinion, if you're going to try and eat healthy popcorn to stave off hunger of something, buy the "healthy choice" stuff or get a hot air popper. But if you want to truly ENJOY popcorn ... this is it.

review/summary: Misleading Nutrition Facts - BE AWARE!
review/text: BUYER BE AWARE! I am not sure if it is intentional or not but it seems very suspicious that they completely omitted to mention the amount of trans fats this product contains in the Nutrition Facts section on this page.<br /><br />According to the nutrition facts here, the amount of trans fats is left blank tricking people in thinking that it has none of them. To my surprise upon getting the box, this product is full of them, to the amount of 4 grams, the most I have seen on a microwave popcorn. Usually you can omit the mentioning of trans fats only if the amount used is negligible based on FDA rules, but this is not the case here.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and double check the nutrition facts at your local grocery before ordering from Amazon because they are doing a really bad job at showing the actual nutrition facts or they just omit information that hurts their sales.

review/text: We love kettle corn and have been searching high and low in the different supermarkets in Los Angeles for this particular brand.  We hate the low fat/low calorie stuff b/c it tastes like cardboard.  But, this particular Jolly Time kettle corn tastes just as good as the ones you get in the street fairs and farmer's markets. It has a great sweet taste.  I'm glad I finally found it at Amazon and just hope Jolly Time continues to make this brand and Amazon continues to sell it.  We are a faithful Jolly Time Kettle Corn family, and we HATE the low fat, low calorie stuff, whether it be Jolly Time or the others.

I also liked that I could take less caffeine in since it takes about 4 mints to equal a cup of coffee.  A little boost, not a jarring jolt.  Taste great.  The cinnamon is my fav, the chocolate is good, more mint than chocolate, but okay.  I can put several into a smaller pill box I keep in my lab coat and keep the mint box in my book bag.  I'm going to check what else they make.

review/summary: Best green tea
review/text: It certainly is a best green tea I have ever had. I would usually put two tea bags of any other green tea in a small cup and this Japanese Sencha is so strong that I typically add extra water to each cup. Taste is amazingly good as well; its quite smooth and yet very strong and tasteful. I don't buy it from Amazon though - our neighborhood grocery store Giant sells it for 1/3rd the price. I have tried tea from almost all the companies and have found Harney and Sons to be the best.
