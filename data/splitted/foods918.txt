review/summary: Love it!
review/text: We have a trolley style popcorn maker and used popcorn oil and popcorn bought at the grocery store at first. We had many unpopped kernels and the taste was only okay.<br /><br />Then I ordered a case of Great Northern Popcorn 8-Ounce Portion Packs. This popcorn is great! We love the taste even three days after popping on the occasion when it lasts that long. We just followed the instructions on the package and all is well.<br /><br />I was a little concerned when I first noticed the oil was in a soft, but solid state. It melts quickly though. The only complaint I have is that it is a little difficult to pour it all in at once, but this is due to the layout of my popcorn popper.<br /><br />We have had friends over for football parties and they have requested more popcorn.

review/summary: Easiest Popcorn for a Crowd!
review/text: I work at the public library and we have family movie programs on a regular basis. There could be anywhere from 10 to 60 people watching the movie and I need to have the popcorn ready at a steady pace. We have one of the big popcorn machines on a cart and use Great Northern Popcorn's 8 ounce packs. The popcorn tastes great and the packaging is perfect for our needs.

review/summary: Best popcorn, best price by subscription
review/text: I ordered this initially just to try something less expensive than the whirly pop brands. I was really glad I did and I will continue to buy it. Everyone loves it and it is the perfect thing for the whirly pop popper. Buying it on subscription is the best way to go - decreases the price and eliminates shipping charges. This is a keeper.

review/summary: Really Great Popcorn!
review/text: We have a Princeton Popper which we bought from this same company, and have owned for close to a year.<br />They are really great people giving excellent customer support, standing behind their products.<br />With that said, this popcorn is really, really great, and you don't have to have a "popcorn machine" to use it. You can cook it on the stove in a big tall pot like you would use for sweet corn. My only suggestion is not to put the lid on the pot but to put a mesh splatter screen over it. This will permit the vapor to escape keeping the popcorn light and fluffy and not moist.<br />This popcorn is so good you don't need to add butter either. It's fine just the way it is which is better for our health too. I have two family members that have bought Princeton machines and this popcorn because they liked ours so much, and any time friends come over for a movie or just to visit, they always ask if I would make popcorn.<br />The 8 oz. cases shipped free through Amazon really don't cost any more per oz. than you'd pay for Orville microwave in a grocery store and is hundered fold better. Ever eat left-over microwave popcorn the next day?....Yuk, it's disgusting. And you're not suppose to breath the vapor when you first open the bag fresh out of the microwave, and you want to eat that stuff? Great Northern still tastes fresh and good for days if you bag it up. After your first bag of Great Northern you'll wonder why on Earth you ever keep eating that junk from the grocery store.

review/text: If you have been looking for the "REAL" theater popcorn flavor, you found it!<br /><br />Very good popcorn. If you use all of the package's ingredients, you might end up with popcorn on the salty side, but that can be adjusted by not using the whole content of the salt package.<br /><br />I have several people tasted this popcorn and they all agree that it tastes like movie theater popcorn.<br /><br />I definitively recommend this popcorn.

review/summary: Nice flavor - but extremely salty.
review/text: I purchased the 2.5 bags for my  new Whirley Pop pan. I like the idea of the oil on one side and the popcorn on the other, very much like I remember the old TV Time popcorn from when I was a kid. I popped up the first bag, but I found there was way too much salt for me. The next batch, I clipped a small corner of the popcorn side off and removed most of the salt. Now, the popcorn is just the way I like it and I added just a bit of butter. Try it first and then see if the salt/seasoning is too much for you - it was very easy to remove. I found that the 2.5 size was perfect for one, maybe two people, but truthfully, I can eat all of it by myself while watching a movie.

I HAD to throw it away. They shipped in a nice box but nothing was refrigerated.<br />I did not get the green olives, I got the red ones instead. They are Frutto d'Italia Red Cerignola Olives.<br />I also got instead of the Cherry Tomato Spread I received San Giuliano Black Olive Spread- and nothing else.<br />Instead of the crisps they were supposed to send I got Lazzaroni Olive Brucshette instead of plain bruschette... I got olive flavored.<br />Lots of olive.<br />Wish they had stuck with the plan instead.<br />Got 7 pieces when they should have sent 8.

review/text: My husband and I love the Raspberry Quince tea from Republic of Tea and we actually received this as a sample bag when we ordered the Raspberry Quince bottled tea from RoT. I tried it and have to say that it's really good. The hibiscus tea has a hint of berry and citrus, lending it a nice fruity flavor without being overpowering. The natural sweet flavor is a bonus as it means I can have it without adding any sugar or artificial sweetener. This tea can be steeped hot or as iced tea. The tea is also caffeine-free, and the main ingredients are hibiscus (flower), sweet blackberry (leaf), and stevia (leaf). Refreshing and wonderful!

review/summary: Natural Hibiscus from The Republic of Tea
review/text: My wife decided to try hibisus tea because it was recommended (by Dr. Oz on his show) as a way to lower blood pressure. She was already taking prescription medicine to lower her blood pressure, and continues to do so. The hibiscus is a supplement. She began drinking three cups of hibiscus tea each day, as suggested on the container, and within a few days her blood pressure had decreased by at least 10 per cent. She cut back to two cups a day, and several days ago began taking only one cup a day.  Her blood pressure has remained in the target zone. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D5MQOW">The Republic of Tea, Natural Hibiscus, 36-Count</a>

On the back the ingredients are Hibiscus, Sweet Blackberry and STEVIA.  If this was a decent company they would put SWEET on the front label.  I will never buy this brand again.

review/text: I bought 8 of these when they were $1.75 and on sale for 4 for the price of 3.  I would buy Dingo Dental Munchy Stix 10-Sticks, 3.1-Ounce again at that price because my dogs do like them.  However, the price since went up to $7.70, then to $6.24 for a single package.  They should sell several packages at that price.  NOT WORTH anything close to that price, especially when you can buy them in the store for $1.52.<br /><br />Also, they don't freshen either of my dogs' breath much at all (even after going through about 10 packages of them), so they're just like a regular treat in that respect.  For breath freshening (but not teeth cleaning) Chocolick Mints work well (not real chocolate, but you are giving your dog the taste for chocolate, not really a good thing, either).

review/summary: Max's favorite treat
review/text: Looks pretty unappetizing if you ask me, but to my dog Max these treats are the cat's pajamas. He has separation anxiety, so I've tried a number of things to distract him with when I leave to make him happy and keep the peace. Dingo stix works the best by far, so I always have a good supply on hand.

review/summary: A Bit of a Gimmick, but Still Good
review/text: Dingo Dental Munchy Stick / B000FPKZTQ<br /><br />My puppy loves Dingo Munchy Stix, so the dental versions seemed like an easy way to keep his teeth clean and healthy. He likes the taste almost as much as the regular Stix, and sweet breath and healthy teeth are a good thing, right?<br /><br />Only we've learned from our trainer since then that ANY hard, chewy treat will clean his teeth by dislodging stuck food, and will strengthen his teeth with the chewing. We've also learned that the outside of his teeth still need to be cleaned regularly with dog 'toothpaste' (not the same as human toothpaste, which is dangerous for dogs) and that no munchy stick can serve as a replacement in this area.<br /><br />So, basically, we're paying extra for the Dingo Dental sticks for the pretty green color and the fresh parsley smell. Not for superior dental treatment. It's a bit of a gimmick, but since they are covered with the 4-for-3 deal on Amazon, I'll occasionally throw a pack into my order because my dog does like them, and because it doesn't hurt to buy into a gimmick once in awhile. And, hey, I could always be wrong and it never hurts to be sure your dog has good teeth. But if you are short of cash, the regular Dingo Munchy Stix are much cheaper and will probably strengthen and clean out your puppy's teeth just as well.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: Never going back to the "old way"
review/text: We have four cats, all of whom have very, very different tastes -- one eats anything, one eats only one type of dry food EVER, and the other two are somewhere in between.  So I was thrilled that all four of them love these treats.  Everyone comes running now when I shake the bag.<br /><br />The pockets a half-marble size cylinder of playdoh-like treat, that you can mash over and around small pills.  We have three cats who receive pills at least once a day, and this had made the process completely painless for everyone.  Our petsitter wrote us a note to thank us, in fact, and has recommended these to all her other clients.<br /><br />One note on the size -- our cats are "chewers" or "swallowers."  The swallowers don't seem to chew these treats at all, just gulp them down no problem.  The chewers actually chew these treats, and spit out the pills.  We get around this by tearing each treat into two pieces, and tossing the empty piece first.  The second piece, with the pill, seems to go down faster, without a spit-out pill.<br /><br />A second note is that these are much too small for capsule-type pills, especially for chewers.  If your cat is on larger capsules (like some antibiotics are), you may need to find another solution, like emptying the capsule into a treat, or just using these as a reward after giving the capsule "the old way."

review/summary: Veterinary approved for dogs. Still mixed about cats...
review/text: As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.<br /><br />Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those "duh" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.<br />My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of "treat."  It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it "makes pills a treat to give!"<br /><br />The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger "capsule" dog Pill Pockets.<br /><br />The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!<br /><br />For dogs, 5 stars. For cats, I'm only giving 3 stars, as only one of my two cats will eat them!<br /><br />Dr. Justine Lee, DVM, DACVECC<br />Author of "It's a Dog's Life... but It's Your Carpet" and "It's a Cat's World...

review/summary: Pill Pockets a Lifesaver!
review/text: My 15 year old tortoiseshell, Sadie, has hyperthyroidism and requires 1/2 pill each morning. After trying liquid form, medicated treats and even pills by themselves, forget it! Sadie was having none of it and she was becoming increasingly stressed out.<br /><br />At the suggestion of our new vet, we tried Greenies Pill Pockets. They come in several flavors (salmon, tuna, chicken, etc.) and are shaped like little pockets, the consistency of soft clay. They may be purchased through your vet, or at anyplace like PetCo, since they are not a prescription item. (They may be ordered over the Internet as well for better pricing; however, our vet warned us to be sure to check out the expiry date on the package when it arrives).<br /><br />The trick is to hold the pill pocket in one hand and place the pill (or capsule) with the other hand into the pill pocket (without actually touching the pocket with that hand) to avoid cross-contamination with the medication smell. With the hand holding the pocket, close it up so it resembles a treat and give it to the cat.<br /><br />Since I have hypothyroidism, I say to my Sadie: "Mommie's gonna take her special treat first, then it'll be Sadie's turn for her special treat!" Sadie actually sits and watches me take my Synthroid, then prepare her "special treat." I fuss her up and tell her what a good girl she is and make a show of it every morning. Sadie gets all excited and gobbles up her "special treat" without any problems anymore.<br /><br />It's a daily ritual that's become very special to both of us. On the weekends when I can sleep in a bit longer, or if I sleep through the alarm during the week, Sadie will actually jump on the bed and softly tap my face to wake me up - letting me know it's time for our special treat. It's been fabulous!

review/summary: Very handy
review/text: These make giving pills much easier.  We have two cats that take multiple pills each day and I can mold a pill pocket around two or even three pills and pop them into a cat's mouth without much trouble.  Unlike other reviewers I can't just put a pill in a pill pocket and let our cat eat it because when he chews the pill becomes separated from the pocket.  But he's happy for me help him swallow it whole.<br /><br />And here's a tip: Moisten the pill pocket just before giving it to the cat and it will go down more smoothly.  This is helpful with a cat with a small mouth and throat, like a Persian, or with pockets wrapped around big pills.<br /><br />These soft Pill Pockets may not appeal to cats that are used to only dry food and dry treats.  But the pockets are still helpful to hold several pills together.

I form the pocket around the pills and aim for the back of the throat and hope they swallow on first attempt. One cat has been taking five pills a day for heart disease - five years so far, so he is a long-term user of Greenie's Pill Pockets, both the Salmon and Chicken. Based on that he (we) recommend them. All three of my cats love the crunchy Greenie's cat treats - now those get tasted!

review/summary: Makes it easier to give pills to cats and dogs
review/text: Most of our cats seem to like these and it's an easy way to give a cat a pill without having to pry their mouth open and then try to keep them from spitting the pill out.  We've tried the chicken flavor and they seem to work, but the salmon flavored ones are a little smellier and cats and dogs both seem to like smelly things better.  We use the cat pill pockets for our mini dachshunds so we don't have to keep different products on hand.  (Dogs always seem to go for cat food anyway.)  These pockets are large enough for small capsules as well as pills.  Buying the 6 packs is a good deal and since the bags are a plastic/foil type material they should keep for a long time.  There are 45 pill pockets to each package.

Through experimenting, I found that cutting the Pill Pockets in half and molding the Pocket around the pill to make a smaller piece is much better at fooling my cats.

My cat loves them and thinks they are his special treat, never knowing that inside are the pills that we always were trying to get down his throat! Even my neighbor's cat who I was cat-sitting, who is extremely picky, ate it right away, chewing and chewing so long that I thought the pill would be spit out, but the flavor must really mask the taste of the pill!<br /><br />Entirely Pets also has the best price that I've ever seen.<br /><br />DianeRad

review/summary: My cat says YUM!
review/text: My vet turned me on to this product when my elderly cat developed hyperthyroidism.  He's master of his domain and nobody is going to force a pill down his throat and trying to disguise it in his food is a joke.  However, with the pill pockets for more than two years now he's just gobbled them up with no fuss and he actually reminds me when its pill time. He only likes the salmon flavor though.

review/text: My cat is a terrible pill taker.  He jerks his head, refuses to swallow, spits the pill out half dissolved...He has been very sick of late and MUST take two antibiotics, one appetite stimulant, and a liver enzyme supplement.  As you can imagine, I have been extremely frustrated at the loss of several pills.  Then I tried these, out of desperation.  I will NEVER use anything else to give him his pills.  Thank you, Greenies, for creating this product!

review/summary: pill pockets for cats
review/text: While I swear by this product and have ordered it several times, I did not find it well packed this time.  Usually it's come in a box, but this time the 6 packs were just jammed into a padded envelope so the actual pockets were smashed....still usable, just not in great shape.  I think the supplier should go back to using a box.

review/summary: No Bitter Pill, This
review/text: Yes, worth every penny if you have a cat like my spirited black Ketzel.<br /><br />My calico will let me pry open her jaws and pop a pill to the back (love to see that tongue touch that little pink nose-- the "all clear" sign for pill-givers).<br /><br />But rogue Ketzel (who needs sedation for nail-cutting-- my fault for letting him get away with it as a kitten), will have none of this.  I drop the pill into the pill pocket, wedge it in place with a twist-tie and seal the top, and he can't wait.  Sometimes if I don't pay attention to my work, he'll snag the Pill Pocket before I get the pill in!  At first, I wasted a few because he figured out how to eat around the pill.  Eventually I learned to make sure the pill was embedded deep inside.  As others have noted, he's ready for his pill every time.<br /><br />This cat has mild renal disease and is on a specialty diet (Purina NF Renal Formula).  The nutritional contents of the Pill Pockets are not listed on the Pill Pocket package, so I confirmed with my vet that it's okay for Ketzel to have the 2 Pill Pockets per day.  You might want to check with YOUR vet, especially if your cat is more acute or sicker.  On the other hand, if you can't get the medicine in any other way, the additional salt, protein, or whatever else is in the Pill Pockets probably doesn't matter.<br /><br />I've bought the six-pack to save a little money and time.

review/summary: LIFE SAVER!!!
review/text: These pill pocket treats are a life saver!  My cat was recently diagnosed with chronic renal failure and now has to take 8 medications twice a day. These pill pockets make it super easy to give him his tablet medications. We stick two of the medications in a treat in the morning and again at night. Two little tablets fit in each pocket.  The best part is that our kitty is anxiously awaiting his medication/treat when we wake up in the morning and before we go to bed. This product has really made our lives easier when coping with our kitty's illness/treatment.

I contacted the company regarding a return and it took two emails before I received an email back that promised I was receiving a replacement shipment in 3 - 4 business days along with a return label.  That was on November 1st.  It is now November 22nd.  I emailed them one more time last week asking where my replacement order was and have not heard back from them.  I will not be buying from them again.

review/summary: Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on
review/text: This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own "stand" in order to fill it properly.

review/summary: This filter works PERFECT!
review/text: Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the "old fashion way" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!

review/summary: Ekobrew Washer Hack
review/text: When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16" thick, 5/32" inside diameter, and 3/8" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.

review/summary: Good Product and Excellent Customer Service
review/text: At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.

review/summary: great design
review/text: Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old "My K-cup" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says "some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this "work around" for the time being."  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more "hole down the middle" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!

review/summary: AH-MAZING!!
review/text: WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!

review/summary: Techno-BEST
review/text: My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.

review/summary: Excellent brew, economical too!
review/text: With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!

review/text: With six cats in the house, let me say I was THRILLED that Amazon.com offered this in their vine program. My cats eat anything that doesn't run away from them, but everyone from the year old cat, to the seventeen year old diabetic kitty LOVED this food. Even my mom's cat, who is known to be pretty finicky loved it.<br /><br />The food looks like "real" food, not the loaf-type food so often seen in canned cat food, and it smells great. Not stinky at all. The cats gobbled it right up, and I like that there is plenty of broth and liquid on the food, because that helps my eldest cat, who is missing several teeth, eat it just fine.<br /><br />I've been feeding wellness and Eagle Pack Holistic food in addition to prescription food. This ranks right alongside those expensive foods. Good stuff!!!!

The fact that it's a product of Thailand concerns me a bit -- I don't know what their standards are for pet food, and after the scandal with the lead in Chinese-manufactured toys, well, I'm a little skeptical. It's also an expensive product. Since I don't have a consensus among the house felines, I doubt I will purchase any more of this product.

review/summary: My Two Cats Inhaled The Stuff
review/text: OK, so I couldn't personally taste this cat food and give you a review. But all I can say is: my two cats (14 and 15 years old) virtually inhaled it. Clawdette is the older one and she is fussy. She likes a cat food that has seafood and tomato in it. Chappie is less picky, but he can turn up his nose at some supermarket brand cat foods. So more often then not I buy the canned cat food at petshops (or on Amazon). I fed them each of the cans in the Variety Pack...and its as if the food vanished off the face of the earth within a few minutes. The bottom line: they loved it, it left their coats nice and softy and glossy, and they had lots of energy. So I (or, rather my cats) give it five stars.

review/summary: If your cat likes people food, this may be for you.
review/text: My cat George never quite finishes a 6-ounce can of cat food, so I thought I would try these 3-ounce servings. However, George is not terribly fond of people food, and he has only finished one of the cans that I have given him so far - the Sesame Chicken, as it turns out. He clearly likes the broth in the Chicken Pot Pie, but he doesn't finish his vegetables, or even all of the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Of course, we can hardly blame him for abandoning one can to attempt to get into the turkey liver I was cutting up. Some people food is too good for cats to pass up!

review/summary: My cat went nuts!
review/text: My fiancee brought this home from his moms and my cat went crazy! She inhaled an entire can in seconds and then begged for more. I completely grossed my fiancee out when I tasted it and let me tell you as someone who is an avid cook the Chicken Pot Pie is very good. I make chicken pot pie and reading the ingredients were like reading the ingredients in a chicken pot pie you would make or buy for yourself. The chicken did not taste processed. The first time I saw the can of food I thought it was gourmet tuna and had to read to make sure it was cat food. I can't say that I blame my kitty for enjoying this so much. We have a local health food store that carries it so it's easy to find for me but the deals online are amazing! I'll be going via Amazon from now on. My cat reacts to this the way she reacts to fresh tuna, she goes nuts!

review/summary: Tigger just Loves it !!
review/text: My Tigger was a kitten when he came to me (Dropped)he loved the outdoors but often got into some accidents that ended up at the Vet's office, needless to say he then wouldn't eat and was loosing weight. I had tried other cat foods but nothing he would even look at, then I tried Petite Cuisine Tuna & Shrimp to mine and Tigger's amazement he fell in "LOVE" and eats well now. He is now 2-yrs old and I have another (Dropped) 2-yr old male Cat and he also loves this cat food. Tigger and Ziggy are very "Happy Cats".

review/summary: More like "human" food than Cat Food
review/text: My cats are crazy for this food, including the one that has turned up her nose at all wet food for 6 years! Unfortunately the price makes it prohibitive as an every day meal since I have 5 cats. Also, I've heard that too much fish is not healthy for cats, they need meat too and they aren't that crazy about the Petite Cuisine Chicken.  I still buy the tuna and just feed it occasionally as an extra treat. The food itself looks and smells just like tuna for humans, maybe even a little better. Some of it has tiny little (whole) shrimp and some pieces of codfish - it also has a lot of tuna oil, which I guess is what the cats like about it because the first thing they do is lap up all the "gravy". I thought maybe if I bought human tuna in oil and spiked their usual soft Friskies, they would enjoy it more, but that didn't work, so I continue to buy Petite Cuisine.

review/summary: Hard to find cat food!
review/text: Directly above it says this review is FROM Petite Cuisine Cat Food. In actuality it is FOR Petite Cuisine Cat Food!!!<br /><br />I used to purchase this cat food at Winn-Dixie stores. About six months ago they stopped carrying it. Amazon was the only place I could find besides the manufacturer that would sell me this at retail. Since the manufacturer wanted an exorbitant amount for purchase at retail Amazon was the only retailer left. Fortunately for me the Amazon program of monthly purchases worked out perfectly. It enables me to buy the food at a price that is acceptable and keeps my cats happy at the same time.<br /><br />As far as the food itself is concerned all I can say is that the cats love it, and it gives them very healthy looking luxurious coats and satisfies their appetites at the same time. If you need a link to make a purchase cut and paste the following into your address bar: [...]

review/summary: Baby Girls' Special Food
review/text: `I was very pleased to see this product online.  I always bought Baby Girls canned food at Food Lion and now they no longer carry it at the local store.  Every cat and kitten who has had the pleasure of trying it loves it.  NOT gummy or looks like mystery meat.  Great product.

review/summary: Otis will eat it!
review/text: Otis is what I call a very picky eater. The fact is, until now, he would not eat the same cat food twice! He is 10 years old.<br /><br />I was in the habit of buying food one can at a time for obvious reasons. I did that for the Petite Cusine as well....the Tuna and sole. He inhaled it. I bought 2 more. This time 2 different varsities of the same brand. Again....gone.<br /><br />Since it is not cheap, I looked for it on line. Amazon had the best deal and I bought 4 cases of variety packs. That was almost a year ago. He still loves it!<br /><br />The other things I like are the ingredients. They are healthy for him.....no fillers.

review/summary: Cats' meow
review/text: The cats should love these little jars of different wet flavors, and even you cats who are accustomed to dry food should like this.  You feel like you're giving them something healthful and gourmet when you serve them this.  The food is quite liquidly, which could be a good or bad thing depending on their and your preference.  Open a jar and serve it to them, and don't mistake it for tuna for yourself!

review/summary: Human food but apparently not cat food
review/text: It looks and smells really good. It has no harmful additives. It is in a cute package. It has names of food that I like. If only my cats could appreciate all of the above qualities! I wonder if other people's cats do. I couldn't find any fault with the food, but then again, I'm human. I'd say it probably depends very much on what your cat's taste is. If your cat enjoys fresh organic food... then buy this. If they like Fancy Feast - don't!!

review/summary: ALMOST PERFECT--
review/text: Would of given this 5 star if it was cheaper. I love the small cans for convenience but not willing to pay for the cost of it. I liked that their was no gagging fishy smell as some cat foods have. My cats loved this food and would of eaten 2 cans at a time if I let her. I will consider keeping this on hand for those times when I need the small can convenience. However, can not afford to purchase this all the time.

review/summary: Ho Hum Response
review/text: Any review of this product, necessarily, must be based upon observation of the four footed furry feline friends (barring any truly dedicated and odd reviewers). We have two cats that deign to call us their owners, at least at feeding time and when the litter box needs cleaning.<br /><br />This is soft food in the petite cans favored by the feline haute cuisine products. However, the similarity seems to end there as the product is flaked rather than sliced or diced, and the sauce is clear with an oily consistency (somewhat like vegetable or olive oil), the pot pie cans were considerably more fluid.<br /><br />The boy, Otis, will eat just about any soft cat food put in front of him unfortunately we were disappointed with his response to this product. The girl, Crystal, is the pickier of the pair and will usually lick a little of the food or sauce before abandoning any soft food (leaving the remnants for Otis), but would not touch this product. I was gratified to see that the product did not come out of China after the problems of the past year.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the cats did not seem to like the product as much as other soft foods. The poor response from the cats means that this one will not make it into the rotation.
