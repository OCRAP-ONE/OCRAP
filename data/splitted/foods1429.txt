review/summary: disapointment
review/text: I was hoping to surprise my kids with a Brazilian Easter eggs, but when my order got to my house, the eggs were melted. Instead of getting a Easter egg, a got a ball of melted chocolate. I don't know what happened, but I know I had to trash the two disgusting ball of melted chocolate. I also know how disappointed my kids were. I didn't returned it because I knew it wouldn't worth it. I hope for the next buyers that the seller gets a better way to have their chocolate eggs delivered without melting, I myself won't be buying it ever again over the internet.

review/text: This was recommended by Dr Oz because it doesn't spike blood sugar the way regular sugar does. I don't know about that, but I do find that a little in my morning coffee doesn't set me up for cravings and that it seems to be compatible with level 3 (maybe even 2) of the Southbeach plan. I do wish it didn't have cinnamon, but that's no big deal.

review/summary: Outstanding Value!!!
review/text: My wife and I are health conscious but are also on a budget.  There are so many good products out there that overprice themselves to the point that the average househould cannot afford to purchase them on a regular basis.  This company, however, sells an outstanding-quality product that is reasonably priced and stands should-to-shoulder with similar products that cost multiple times more.  Big Tree Farms Coconut Palm Sugar with Cinnamon is so delicious!  We've found many ways to use the product to improve the flavors of many staples.  The bonus is, as a previous review stated, that the product is good for you, too!!!

review/summary: Missing more than the salt
review/text: I love Amy's soups, and Amy's Split Pea soup may be my favorite canned soup.  It was with this mindset that I plunged head-long into a twelve-pack of the "low sodium" version seen here.  While it was still satisfying, it fell far short of the original (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1CPUG">Amy's Organic Splt Pea Soup, Low Fat, 14.1 Ounces (Pack of 12)</a>).  I added some salt to try and make up the difference, but it wasn't enough.  The texture was different, and the taste just wasn't the same.  If reducing your salt intake is a high priority then have at, but if you're like me and just want to eat well AND enjoy your meals then go for the full-blown original.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Medium thickness. High quality. This soup could be a great organic choice for those on a lowered sodium diet, but maybe not for those looking for a fuller pea soup taste. Onion is the most prominent secondary flavor note. For me, needed black pepper. Prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1EO64">Amy's Light in Sodium Organic Lentil Soup , 14.5-Ounce Can (Pack of 12)</a> in the Amy's reduced sodium soups.

review/summary: CAUTION!  Dented cans hand-picked for packaging...
review/text: All of the cans in this case are dented in different places. It is obvious to me that dented cans were hand-picked for packaging.  The fault does NOT lie with FedEx or UPS because of the location of the dents.  Someone just took the damaged soups off the shelf and packed them up for sale.  Food items cannot be returned or refunded.  This is a battle with Amazon that will continue until I receive a refund.

review/summary: Good if you add no salt vegetable bullion
review/text: I like Amy's low sodium split pea soup but I have to admit I add a no salt vegetable bullion cube to it before I heat it up and then often add some pink mineral salt after I dish it up. So with a little added TLC it is a great option for an organic meal that is low in the bad for you salt and oils and is BPA free (unlike a lot of canned foods now). I will definitely keep buying this brand of soup! I really like all the flavors when I add the above mentioned ingredients.

review/summary: AMY'S LOW SODIUM PEA SOUP
review/text: I ordered the following Amy's Low Salt Products: Lentil Soup, Pea Soup, Minestrone Soup, and Medium Chili.  All of them are great.  If you are just now switching to Low salt or no salt you may find them to be bland until your body adjusts to the lowered salt intake (that could take months or up to a year).  The biggest complaint most have is the dented cans.  My Minestrone and Chili came in without any dents, the Pea Soup had 2 dented cans and the Lentils had dents in every can.  These dents are not caused by shipping.  All of my shipments came in with the packages totally intact with no signs that the outer shipping box had been roughed up in shipment.  These dents are caused by Amazon or Amy's warehousing.  The cans are not in boxes, they are shrink wrapped so when stacked the cans are actually bearing the weight.  Too much weight and the cans begin to buckle and this buckling will look like dents.  You can also get this same effect if the warehousemen are slamming the 12 pack cans down hard on top of each other.  This happens when workers in the warehouse get tired and become careless, are untrained, or just plain don't care about their job.  If you want to feel better then stay on a low salt diet, if you have ankle swelling then get on a low salt diet and get checked for congestive heart failure.  If you have high blood pressure get on a low salt diet and then increase your intake of magnesium.  Backing off your salt is not easy as it begins to change the way you taste food but if you stay with it and get off the high salt diet you will begin to taste food and not just the salt.  Have you ever eaten at a restaurant where the cook's salt intake is so high that the cook can't tell if he has too much salt in the food he is preparing?  I have more than once and it just destroys the meal.  Instead of buying 12 cans now try the Amy's Low Salt by getting it at your local health food store one can at a time then if you like order from Amazon and save.  Right now they have a 25% discount code when you order.  Write it down and use it as it saved me a few bucks.  Hope this review helps you.

review/summary: Every can dented
review/text: I can confirm what others have noted: if you order Amy's soup here, you can be sure that every can you receive will have a dent in it. Your collection of dents will range from mild to severe. Sometimes this could impede your opening of the can. Maybe you have other concerns. It seems as if Amy's has realized they can unload all of their dented cans on unwitting individual consumers instead of grocers who may balk. As for the soup itself: Fairly tasty...if you add salt.

review/summary: yummy quick lunch
review/text: I usually order quick healthy vegan groceries from amazon because I am in the army and 1.) they don't give me a lot of extra time, 2.) whenever they do provide me food it certainly is not vegan or even somewhat healthy. So i have to usually be prepared to feed myself. Although i do prefer to each lots of raw veggies, cooked quinoa, tofu ect. I do have to have things on hand that do not go bad and can be made in a matter of minutes. The brand Amy's is absolutely wonderful. I have tried at least 5 of their soups and 7 of their frozen wraps. This soup has to be my favorite. 200 calories, organic, you can not beat it. I usually add some extra cracked pepper and curry powder to it. Heats up in 3 minutes and i have something good for me and of course vegan. I know 12 cans seems like a lot but it is good to have on hand when you dont feel like going to the store or are short for time.

review/text: I think that this is some pretty good soup.  I believe that a couple of it's reviews say that the flavor was sacrificed for the low sodium content.  I do add some garlic or Mrs. Dash to mine sometimes.  I love the low sodium aspect even if I have to doctor it a bit.  Hopefully Amy's is working that out, all things are a work in progress.  This soup has tons of potential and if you're watching your sodium and caloric intake and like pea soup, don't hesitate to buy this one.

review/summary: Severely bent cans. Amazon needs to adopt a policy of full disclosure.
review/text: The cans I received were severely bent. This did not happen in shipping. The box was in good condition and packaged well. Amazon needs to indicate the condition of the canned good they are selling (or at least mention the possibility of the cans being bent, because it is starting to appear from the number I have received that they are selling damaged canned goods). I had to throw one of the cans away since the product in it smelled off.

review/summary: First K-Cup coffee I loved.
review/text: A year ago, my dad received a Keurig for Christmas, and with it the K-Cup variety pack. I tried a couple coffee brands without milk and sugar, and this was the one that really caught my taste buds' attention. It's very mild, borderline light-bodied, with a subtle flavor and not too bitter. It doesn't taste like you're chewing on beans, but it's not watered down like some sub-standard brands you find in stores (I'm looking at you Folgers 10lbs jug of "ground").<br /><br />A few months later, a co-worker brought a Keurig to work and offered access to it. I purchased packs of Green Mountain Nantucket Blend the same day and enjoyed 48 cups of it, dreaming of the day I may have a Keurig at home. That has happened now, and I've got this on subscription.<br /><br />Strongly recommend if you are a fan of light-bodied coffee. One of the best K-Cups you'll find in that category.

review/text: I received a box of Nantucket free with my coffee maker but it didn't sound like anything special so I put off trying it, but now it is my favorite!  It is slightly stronger than coffee people coffee shop but has a richer and more flavorful taste.  Not bitter at all, but if you like lighter roasts then you probably will not like this.  I think it tastes best using the 7-8 ounce setting.  This reminds of when I dine out and they have such good coffee but either they don't know or won't tell you what kind it is.  Love it!

review/summary: A saving grace for Green Mountain Coffee...
review/text: When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors.  Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand.  I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee.  We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least.  I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee.  It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried).  I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods.  Almost.  All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out.  When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!

review/summary: Great Value!
review/text: This is a very good deal. The coffee goes without saying. A perfect cup every time.  I have had a Keurig for a few years now, and to me there is nothing out there that can touch it. A fabulous, fresh cup every time. I never go to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks anymore.<br /><br />The offer is a good one. I bought 5 boxes of 24 for $10.95 each and shipping was free! I saw another review where the guy said this was "high" compared to prices locally. I have yet to find the same deal locally. Supermarkets rob you for 12 pods and Bed, Bath and Beyond gives you 16 or 18 for $9.99 at last check (and it could have gone up) as coffee has gone up. I also used to get the same coffee at the same price a couple of years ago at "CoffeeforLess.com. Their prices have increased dramatically recently. I don't see where there are any better values around online or locally.

review/summary: Perfect cup o'coffee!
review/text: Some people like a strong cup of coffee that kicks them in the mouth first thing in the morning, but I don't, so I tried one classified light roast, which was a little too weak for me. I tried Nantucket Blend, and it is perfect! It's not weak at all and had a really delicious flavor to it, what I think a good cup of coffee should taste like. It is so smooth, not a single negative thing about it except that now I go through it so quickly!<br />This is my favorite one so far, and has become my morning drink every day!<br />If you like coffee and are looking for a not too strong, not too weak blend give this a try!

review/summary: Delicious medium-roast blend with complex tones
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:30 Mins<br /><br /></span>The name belies an intoxicating medium-roast blend that fuses flavors from Central America, Indonesia and East Africa. The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex - a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents - opening with the aroma of berries, spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.<br /><br />According to the Green Mountain Coffee website, the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago, "created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner, and the name stuck."<br /><br />I drink Nantucket Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife, who will often add creamer to darker roasts, also enjoys this blend black.<br /><br />In summary, this medium-roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents, 15 cents higher per cup than other brands. Is it worth the additional price? Yes, but keep an eye out for sales.<br /><br />Added bonuses:<br />Nantucket Blend is certified kosher by the Orthodox Union.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is Fair Trade Certified.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is organic.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />BTW: Here's my recent K-cup coffee reviews for Amazon:<br /><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYUE6G">Green Mountain Coffee Lake & Lodge Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003C4YIFE">Green Mountain Coffee Vermont Country Blend</a><br />4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread</a>

review/text: We got a box of this along with our Keurig brewer from Costco. We have three coffee drinkers in the house and all of us are fond of strong, dark-roasted coffee.  This blend is underroasted and weak.  The one good point is that it isn't as sour as most cinnamon roasts are.  We ended up throwing out half the box because I couldn't get anybody to drink it.<br /><br />If you're a fan of very mild medium-roasts you'll probably enjoy this.  If you like coffee strong and dark with some body to it you'll hate it.

review/summary: A good price If you cannot buy local
review/text: Buying K-Cups appears to take more math & literacy skills than most people seem to have.  People keep comparing the price of different boxes without accounting for the cup-count.  The trick is to comparison shop the price per-Kcup because the boxes vary from 18 count boxes to 24 count boxes...eight more cups makes a difference.  This a a fair deal in my opinion since you get two 24 count boxes, and it is shipped to your door.

I checked my Amazon account and it said the product would ship between July and August.  Three to four months for shipping?  How very ridiculous.  I must say that this is my fault.  It clearly says that in the product listing.  However, I usually get everything I order from Amazon.com within a couple or three days, so I didn't even think to look.

review/text: I've tried a lot of different K-Cups and this is the weakest K-Cup coffee I've ever tried. It should not be labeled "Medium Roast", it should be labeled "Warm Water Tasteless" Roast. Too bad I bought a large box. What a waste...

review/summary: Not What I Ordered
review/text: I ordered the Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend which I like as a smooth medium roast morning coffee.  I received the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend which is too mild for my liking.  Three stars for the coffee received. I won't order again from the Amazon marketing partner that sold it.

review/summary: Poor coffee , Nothing to do with Nantucket, named wrong
review/text: The Ingredients aren't from Nantucket, the blend is not smooth. Too heavy  or something maybe too much arabica.<br /><br />then today I learn Green Mountain Coffee is involved with this:<br />Burlington, Vermont - October 25, 2010<br /><br />Could a routine inquiry into accounting practices at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters lead to an insider trading investigation? A Wall Street whistleblower believes it's possible after reviewing documents from the Securities Exchange Commission.<br /><br />The SEC is already conducting an informal inquiry into Green Mountain's "revenue recognition practices." And now Sam Antar, a securities expert who has worked with federal investigators, says public documents show a company executive sold thousands of shares just before the company publicly disclosed the SEC inquiry. The announcement of the inquiry was followed by a 16-percent drop in Green Mountain's stock price.<br /><br />A group of shareholders are already suing the company, alleging executives artificially inflated the stock price and cashed in before the price drop. And Antar says the timing of the stock sale is the kind of thing that could trigger an insider trading investigation.<br /><br />Not recommending this at all. Try the Donut Shop Kuerig Coffee its a lot better blend..

review/text: I hated this K-cup and couldn't wait to be done with the box.  (We hate wasting unless toxic.)  So while not toxic, the best I can say for this variety is that it tastes like bitter, yet weak "sock water".  Now, after reading the many good reviews this blend has received, I'm apprehensive to trust the reviews of the other K-cup varieties.

review/text: Green Mountain now colors the box light green but this product is caffeinated. Wife got Snookered caused she thought Medium roast didn't have caffeine; just cause the box was light green. Don't you get fooled too.  Coffee had a bitter taste had to put MORE French Vanilla creamer in it to make it have a smoother taste. ( that was medium roast)  Going back to Newmans Medium roast Decafe..by Kuerig.

review/summary: A very nice, full flavored medium roast coffee
review/text: I prefer deep, dark roasted coffees but many people don't.  My mother used standard household blends such as Folger's for many years.  When she received her Keuring machine she started to experiment with other brands and blends.  She occasionally drinks a flavored coffee but this has become her favorite.  I get her a couple of boxes a month and she loves it.  I have tried it and here is my take on this blend:<br /><br />The body (or "mouth-feel") is light to medium.  The acidity is medium-low so it won't have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream.  The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish.  This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a "Starbucks-type" of coffee too strong or bitter.  If you, like my mother, enjoy a "regular" blend I don't think that it get's better than this.

review/summary: Berry flavors, full body and subtle smokiness
review/text: The box says it's "one of the most sophisticated blends you'll ever enjoy. Borrowing berry flavors from African beans, a full body from Indonesian beans, and a subtle smokiness from a touch of French Roast, this blend represents a spectacular tapestry of flavors carefully woven together."  It's still a smooth tasting coffee even with all of those descripters.  This coffee actually brings together 4 different coffees from 3 different continents.<br /><br />Actually, this coffee would be for someone who likes a smooth cup of coffee, it's comparable to Folger's medium roast.  You can still add your french vanilla creamer and sweeteners with no problem.  It doesn't cause the coffee to go bitter.  It wouldn't disappoint the avid coffee drinker nor shun the occasional java drinker either. Overall, it's a nice cup of coffee.

review/summary: My favorite coffee K-cup so far
review/text: I first tried this brand and blend as part of a k-cup sampler pack. I was immediately in love with this k-cup! It's my very favorite so far. My personal preference for coffee is a nice bodied medium roast, and this more than fits the bill. It has the smoothest taste of the 6 or 7 medium roasts/breakfast blends that I have tried so far. If you like high octane, this is not going to be your favorite k-cup, but you would certainly enjoy it as a nice change of pace every now and then. My benchmark for a good k-cup is that I can use the large (9oz) setting on my Keurig and still get a cup of real coffee, not coffee flavored water. This passes the test with flying colors. If I need a kick in the pants to get out the door in the morning, I drop down to the 7oz setting for a slightly stronger brew. I like the fact that the taste remains smooth, even if I make it a little stronger. I give this k-cup an A+!

review/summary: The Best in the Pack
review/text: I recently purchased the Keurig B-60 Special Edition Brewer from Amazon.  It came with a sample variety pack of 12 different K-cup blends (note no light blends included).  I tried all of them and found this particular blend to be the best to my liking although I do prefer a light blend.  It has a nice coffee aroma (like one you would smell at a good restaurant but can't produce at home) and surprised me by tasting as good as it smelled.  It is a medium blend and tastes relatively smooth without an excessively strong or acidic aftertaste.  Recommend to fellow Amazon customers that prefer a  medium blend coffee.  I recently found the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend available at my local Walmart and plan to write a review on it.

review/summary: So far the best tasting Keurig coffee cups I could find
review/text: I was recently given the top of the line Keurig single cup coffee maker from Costco that came with a lot of different flavors to test out.  This Nantucket blend was easily the best of the bunch.  It truly is a great tasting coffee and I can't believe it comes out of my Keurig.<br /><br />Now I do drink a cup of coffee every day and I'm not fond of the waste that this product produces so I actually have one of these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW">ekobrew Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> and grind my own coffee.  It's cheaper and better for the environment and it's what I use for myself.  However, the fine dust does pass through the filter so I don't like to give it to guests.  I don't mind the dust though that settles at the bottom of the cup and for being much cheaper I don't mind.<br /><br />These cups though I save for my guests so that they can get a great cup of coffee without any of the dust.  And they all love this coffee.

review/summary: Too Weak for Me; Turns White After Adding Cream
review/text: I've had to hunt far and wide to find the right K-cups for me.  Generally, I like coffee people donut shop, and that had been my go to coffee for a while.  The dark bold coffees are way too intense for me, but the mediums are generally way too weak.  Wanting to try something new, I followed the reviews and tried this coffee thinking it would be a good strong but-not-too-strong alternative.<br /><br />It wasn't.  If I use two pods, this is a decent, but weaker, coffee for me to use in my travel cup for the ride into work.  Otherwise, it is much too weak.  I was very surprised that the first time I brewed some and poured in half and half, the coffee turned very light brown.  It was almost white.  I will get through this package, but I will not buy again.  It's not cost effective for me to use two pods to be satisfied.  Any other suggestions?

The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex - a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents - opening with the aroma of berries, spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.<br /><br />According to the Green Mountain Coffee website, the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago, "created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner, and the name stuck."<br /><br />I drink Nantucket Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife, who will often add creamer to darker roasts, also enjoys this blend black.<br /><br />In summary, this medium-roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents, 15 cents higher per cup than other brands. Is it worth the additional price?

Back to instant. Maxwell House had some nice instant.<br /><br />But my family wanted a Keurig coffee maker, so--for the holidays this year--I bought one. The coffee that came with it was a Newman's Own blend. Pretty bold and tasty (better than instant and quite a bit better than my memory of Mr. Coffee). I recently ordered this through Amazon. It is not quite as bold as the Newman's Own k-cup coffee. But it does have a smooth taste that starts the day off nicely. So, I have encountered two good coffees for the Keurig coffee maker!

I use half and half and splenda but I was be good with just cream,milk,half and half etc no sugar or sweetener needed. 48 cups for the price is a little much considering there are places that sell 96 for 51$ also you have to factor in the cost of shipping. If your looking for K-cups in bulk try coffeeforless.com otherwise this is fine.
