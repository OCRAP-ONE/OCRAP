review/summary: Vinturi review
review/text: We were a little sceptical about the Vinturi, but did a blind taste test of before and after pouring our wine through the Vinturi.  All six of us thought the wine was much smoother after being poured throught the Vinturi.  Also, the Vinturi in the acrylic stand is kind of fun and showy.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: It's amazing how Vinturi enhances the flavors and aromas of wines. We absolutely love it! It's also very attractive to look at with the stand. When we have dinner parties friends are always curious about it. We have them do a blind tasting by pouring them a red straight out of the bottle and one aerated by vinturi. Vinturi wins every time. We purchased it in February and it's been the life of the party.

review/summary: Taste of Wine Enhanced
review/text: Our family has enjoyed sharing wine, but now that we use the Vinturi Aerator for each glass, the wine's full potential is enhanced to taste grapes as they were intended.  We first experienced the aerator during a wine tour and was delighted to find it available on Amazon.  Of course, the Amazon price was more affordable than retail....that's what makes Amazon so great! Once you taste wine using the aerator, you won't want to pour wine directly from the bottle again.

I just received it last week and have only used it a couple of times but I can definitely taste a difference in the wine. The flavors are enhanced and even made my regular week-night, inexpensive bottle of red smoother. I do have drips along the tower, but I may be pouring it wrong.

review/summary: AMAZING PRODUCT!!
review/text: We learned about this product from friends and loved it.  Later, we visited the Messina Hoff Winery in College Station/Bryan, Texas, where they used it during wine tasting and also sold them for $50 for the aerator and $55 for the tower that holds the aerator. We researched the product and although there are different ones out there that claim to serve the same purpose, the Venturi seems to be the best for the job, which is probably why the winery prefers it to make their wines taste even better. People were purchasing them frequently at the winery because they, too, were impressed with the improvement of the wine flavor after trying it with and without while tasting.  Getting the whole set for 1/2 that price with no tax and free s&h from Amazon made me love it even more.

review/summary: Taste the Difference
review/text: I did a taste test pouring wine with and without using the Vinturi Red Wine Aerator.  The difference was amazing!  The wine poured using the aerator displayed the wine's nose more fully and the complex layers of the wine were also displayed much quicker.  I especially liked the fine mesh sieve that caught any sediment in the wine.  This is a product for everyone who appreciates wine.

review/summary: Amazing Product
review/text: I will recommend this product to everyone who drinks wine or even those who just started to try wine.  This gadget can make a bottle of wine go down smoothly, it takes the "acidity" of the wine away and therefore, the wine taste very smooth when you drink it.  I am saying this because I'm not a wine drinker, but I can tell the difference when 2 glasses of wine was put in front of me to try, one glass of wine was pour through the Aerator and the other wasn't.  I was able to tell right away which one was lighter and smoother, and that was the glass of wine that was pour through the Aerator.  I love the product so much that I've bought the red and wine Vinturi Wine Aerator as a Christmas present for my in-laws this year.  The other thing that I forgot to mention is that it is a great product to take it with you as it comes with a travel pouch, you can definately show off to your friends and believe me, this will be a centre piece for conversation where the social gathering is.

review/summary: Opens the palate and creates a new wine!
review/text: I got a bottle of my fav. cab and poured a glass then I poured a glass using the Vinturi aerator. I asked my wife to keep track of what glass is what and move them so I didn't know which. It was like drinking two different wines. The aerator really opened up the wine and brought out the flavors. I make my own wine and I used the aerator on a blueberry wine I made and this really brought the blueberry flavor to life. Anyone serious about their red wines needs this product!!

review/summary: Vinturi Wine Aerator Set -  Opens the Bouquet
review/text: This is a beautifully made product and works magnificently.  Many of the California wineries we recetly visited carried these for twice the price.  One of them demonstrated the value by opening a bottle of wine and pouring a sample into a glass, then pouring another sample through the aerator.  The difference was night and day... we were sold.  We had to have this; people always comment on how attractive it is and we perform the same demo for them.  You will love it and even inexpensive wine tastes great once it is aerated.

review/text: The Vinturi works great. Easily and quickly improves the taste and smoothness of the wine. Have performed blind taste tests with family members and friends using a bottle of red wine, some glasses aerated, some straight out of the bottle. The aerated glasses of wine were always picked as better tasting and much smoother. The difference is quite noticeable. The Vinturi is an amazing product.

review/summary: Really Works
review/text: I had my doubts at first, so I researched it and found favorable reviews from different wine/food pubs. Besides looking great, the stand is stable and secures the aerator quite well.<br /><br />I tried it with a Cabernet that I have enjoyed over the years.  The Vinturi  delivered on it's promise to reduce tanins, increase the bouquet and smooth out the finish.  I was impressed that it actually enhanced the experience of my favorite cab!<br /><br />I have been using it regularly for about a month now. One small draw back is that some wine always ends up in the 2 air holes/vents. Perhaps with more practice the correct rate of the pour will be achieved.  It rinses out very easliy so this is not a big deal.  Overall, well worth it.

review/summary: Very nice wine accessory.
review/text: This is a very nice wine accessory and it looks beautiful on the counter. It does areate the wine well and improves the taste of a newly opened bottle of red wine.<br /><br />Minor Issues:<br />1) You do have to pour wine in the top gently. Pouring too fast or not in the center of the opening can cause wine to splash and not areate properly.<br /><br />2) I wish they would have put a single point on the bottom outlet instead of a circular ring.  After the wine is finished going through, the final drops adhere to the ring surface.  If the outlet ring was a more singular point much less remaining wine would adhere to the ring.<br /><br />Just my thoughts.

review/summary: A Red Wine Lover's prayer has been answered!
review/text: I am so glad that I waited to purchase the Vinturi now that the tower is available.  I wanted to order the set through a local retailer in my hometown and they wanted to charge me $89 for the set + S&H + Tax.  I thought that was ridiculous, therefore I left and went home to see how much amazon was selling the set for.  As usual, amazon had a better price for the set and the best part was no charge for shipping or sales tax!  I ended up paying $48.50 for the set.  Currently, amazon has it priced under $40, which is a great value when the tower alone costs that much!<br /><br />It is important to know that the correct size and shape of glass that you drink out of makes a huge difference in taste but the Vinturi makes the experience that much better.  The Vinturi does fulfill its purpose of aerating wine and allowing those of us with a short attention span or lack of patience in speeding up the process of allowing a red wine to breathe.  The Vinturi is very easy to use and extremely easy to clean.  The tower is great when entertaining since guests just need to place their glass in the tower and pour their wine through the Vinturi for a great tasting glass of red wine.<br /><br />This set is made for red wine and their is a white wine Vinturi that is sold separately.  I am a red wine fan so this is the only set that I need.  The Vinturi is a great conversation piece and a great addition to any bar or entertaining space.  I leave my Vinturi on display because it really does have a cool and sleek design.<br /><br />Once again, if you are a red wine fan and you can get this set for under $40 then this is a must have for you!<br /><br />Salute! vuotate i biccieri - bottoms up!

All wine has bad gasses in the bottle - you either need to open and let it sit for an hour or so, yeah right... or aerate it.  This is the best way to go.  We have 4-5 carafes and that works - but you have a party - 5-8 bottles of wine - all in carafes?  Which is in which?  Space?  Buy one of these and enjoy!

review/summary: Vinturi Aerator Set
review/text: I ordered the Vinturi Aerator Set as a present for my wife.  When assembled, it looks beautiful.  However, when you pour your red wine through the aerator, the wine leaks out through the two air holes and fills the base of the stand with red wine.  The wine even splashed out through the holes too.  Following the exact instructions of carefully pouring the wine into the aerator so that is runs down the side of the aerator only, was better except for the fact that the red wine then only leaked out of one air hole instead of two.<br /><br />I give the Vinturi Aerator Set one star for beauty only.  Now, where do I send the dry cleaning bill to?

I can deal with the wine dripped from the aerator but not the splatter since it will ruin your beautiful table cloth unless you place it on the kitchen counter.  It would be messy even on the kitchen counter.  This "Deluxe" package looks elegant when first set up, but it looks messy just after served three glasses of wine.  I will be returning this to Amazon for a refund.

review/summary: Top Way to Enjoy Your Wine
review/text: My parents drink wine, go to tastings, and attend wine festivals on a regular basis and suggested I try a wine aerator.  Amazon had the best price with free shipping.  Most wines do taste better with the aerator and it is kind of fun to taste the wine with and without being aeratred.  The box set is nice because it gives it a storage place.  I bought the one with the arm and paid more, but it wasn't necessary.  I normally just hold the aerator in my hand and pour the wine in slowly.  You do need the black rubber stand for the aerator to sit in when you are done because it will drip and cannot stand up on its own.  The aerator is easy to clean, I just run some water through it.  I'd recommend this product if you drink wine, and I'd recommend not buying the arm stand with it.  Other places I saw had a white and red aerator.  I heard that you don't need to aerate whites, but I have only tried it with red wines.

When the aerator arrived I had him do a blind taste test with a glass of wine poured from the bottle and another through the aerator and to my delight he said the glass from the aerator was more drinkable!  Ha!  This is a great product if you drink wine like I do- quickly.  I know that a glass bottle aerator is the proper method however if you are like me you don't have the time nor patience to go that route.  This aerator is fool proof and has made almost every red wine taste better.  It's portable so I have taken it with me to parties and now my friends are all believers too.  If you drink red wine you've gotta try this product! Cheers!

review/summary: Incomplete item
review/text: I was very happy to received the Vinturi Deluxe prior Christmas for my boyfriend.  But when I inspect the items in the box, I noticed that there's a chip on the base of the tower and the traveling pouch was missing.  The item was not a 6-piece wine aerator set, but a 5 piece wine aerator set.  I was very disappointed, but glad that my boyfriend was happy about this gift, he said the chip on the base doesn't affect or the tower is still standing.  I could have return this item back, but his been wanting this since he caught his eye on this item at Bevmo.  So, I will give this transaction 2 stars for an incomplete item and for not disclosing the chip on the tower.

review/summary: Wine lovers:  Get the Vinturi...skip the stand
review/text: First of all, if you are a wine drinker, get this.  It works, or else I've been taken by the psychology of it.  I first encountered it at the Sterling winery in California.  Since we were joining the "club", we got quasi-VIP treatment, which included a demo of this device on a newly opened bottle of wine (yes, the Sterling wine store had them for sale for $45).  Wine was poured into one glass from the bottle, and another through the Vinturi.  It clearly made a difference in aroma and taste.  We've since done a couple of blind tests, and picked the aerated wine every time.<br /><br />Now, let me save you a couple bucks.  The basic device includes a small rubber stand for storing the Vinturi.  It is just fine.  The upgraded 6-piece set includes a less-than-useful stand.  It is not attractive enough to leave on display, so it's another bulky thing to store.  Also, we found that our wine glasses were either too short--and we got spashing--or they were too tall and wouldn't fit.  Plus, the stand holds the Vinturi perfectly vertical, which is contrary to the included instructions, which tell you to tip it slightly to the side.<br /><br />So, fellow wine drinkers, get the $25.47 model, and you'll be quite pleased.  Don't waste your money on the six-piece version with the stand.

review/summary: It really works!
review/text: Well, I'll be... this silly little thing actually works. How can you get the effect of decanted wine in the time it takes to pour a glass from a newly-opened bottle? After reading other reviews, I was convinced to try it, but after seeing it work I thought, "There's no way- that was too fast and too easy."<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />I took 3 blind taste tests. I washed 2 identical glasses, opened a new bottle of Merlot, poured one straight from the bottle and poured the other through the Vinturi Aerator. I left the room and asked my wife to move the glasses to the table and call me when all the bubbles were gone. There was no question which one had been aerated. I picked it right away. Even when my son tried to tell me I picked wrong, I stood by my choice, it was that obvious. It softens the wine, releases the bouquet and created a silky finish. I took multiple tests and picked it right every time. My wife took turns testing and could tell as well.<br /><br />I got an aerator for red and white so a couple days later I opened a bottle of white and did the same test and got the same results. The difference is enough that I won't have a glass without it now. Even wine I would normally open and pour and drink right away is now aerated, red or white, it makes a real difference.<br /><br />I bought the tower, which is an added expense, but it's nice for parties so guests can serve themselves and not have to handle the aerator, just pour and enjoy. The quality of the parts feel solid, not cheesy plastic like I thought it would be. Taken care of, I don't see why these can't last for many years, and since it's just liquid and air, it should work just as well in 10 years as it does today.<br /><br />I'm impressed and plan to show them off to my fellow wine enthusiasts at our annual New Years party.

review/summary: Aerator yes, tower no
review/text: I have had this aerator for many months and am very pleased with it's ability to let the wine breath as it is poured. This aerator is quick and relatively neat, except for some drippage from the air holes. I highly recommend it for heavier red wines.<br />Now the stand/tower just makes this drippage issue worse. It runs down the inside of the stand pooling where you would set a glass, and down the outside of the stand directly onto the table/tablecloth.<br />I love my aerator, I just wish it didn't drip the way it does.

review/summary: We love our wine and the Venturi is fantastic.
review/text: The Venturi is just what we hoped it would be.  All the young wines at restaurants today make it difficult.  We've used it on a newer red, 2007 Brunello, and an older, 1998 Shiraz, just to see the difference.  The Shiraz was already ready to drink but the Venturi opened it quickly.  The 2007 was amazing - it was far too young and yet the Venturi did the trick.  It still isn't a 1998 vintage but the difference was truly amazing.  You can take the Venturi anywhere in its cloth case.  Get the tower as well but use a decanter underneath instead of a wine glass.  With a glass (even a taller one) there is some spill from the height.  The tower does have a "catch" for the spill but the decanter takes away most of that.

review/summary: Impressed in many ways..
review/text: A friend bought the Red wine Vinturi model recently. He and his wife visit the Napa Valley area frequently and have gotten to know the vineyards and owners. Back at home, they have a basement wine cellar. I mention this because his wife and he enjoy wine for what it is, and doesn't fool with junk. He brought the Vinturi out and explained how and why this gadget worked, which I and others found did quite well. I was impressed and confident enough to turn around and buy a Red wine Vinturi for my brother's 40th birthday gift, which was used with numerous bottles of wine. Another brother in attendance nicknamed the device "Bobcat" after comedian Bobcat Goldthwait for the intensely caffeinated noise this thing makes as the wine mixes with air. Blind taste testing resulted in most everyone picking the glass of wine poured though the Vinturi with having the best flavor, which seems lighter, sweeter and with a better aftertaste. They hosted another party shortly after the birthday party and emailed me that the Vinturi was a centerpiece "hit". I have bought one myself; maybe I should start entertaining others now...the wine will be at its best.

review/summary: Helpful, but not magic
review/text: Don't expect a miracle, but it does help.  I usually let a good glass of red wine sit for about an hour to an hour and a half before drinking it.  The Vinturi product cannot match this, however, it is equivalent to letting wine sit for about 15 to 20 minutes.  If that's what you are used to doing, you'll be happy.  If you really let your wine age properly, you won't be happy unless you are simply using the device to speed up the process.  Using the Vinturi and then letting the wine sit for an hour produces a nice wine.  It can cut about 30 minutes off the normal process without the aerator.<br /><br />I tested the device on four bottles of good reasonably priced wines.  They were -<br /><br />1) Bogel Old Vine Zinfandel (2007) - full body, very good Zin $11<br />2) Rodney Strong Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon (2007) - very good Cabernet that needs some air $18<br />3) Shenandoah Vineyards Zinfandel Special Reserve (2008) - very nice full body zin $10<br />4) Grand Pacific Vineyards Heritage Red table Wine (2007) - surprisingly decent inexpensive and easily drinkable $7<br /><br />The aerator worked to some degree on all of the wines, but on the full bodied Cabs and Zins, it really couldn't begin to compete with letting a glass of wine sit in a wide glass for 90 minutes.  For the table wine, it did a better job, but there was still a noticeable difference between letting it age naturally and using the aerator.  Blind tests on all of the wines showed modest improvements over drinking the wine straight out of the bottle, but also showed significant difference between aerating and further aging.<br /><br />Next point, the tower is a joke.  It enhances splattering instead of preventing it.  The only way to use the tower and stop splatter is to jam the opening below the rim of the glass.  Without the tower, the device isn't bad.

review/summary: Great concept
review/text: A friend recommended a wine aerator, so I ordered the Vinturi set from Amazon for my husband who is the wine connoisseur in our household. The aerator is great, but the stand is a waste of money. If you try to pour the wine through the aerator using the stand, the wine pours directly down and makes a mess. The directions say to hold the aerator at an angle, which is what you have to do to make the aerator work properly. I don't understand why the stand/holder aims the aerator straight down rather at an angle as instructed. I highly recommend the aerator but not in the set. It is better and less expensive to order the aerator separately and forget the stand because the stand simply cannot be used without making a complete mess on the countertop. As for the aerated wine, my husband says that a mediocre bottle wine tastes like a much more expensive wine when aerated with the Vinturi, and that was the objective, so the aerator is great, but the stand is worthless.

It's a great tool for heavier wines that you don't have time to let open before you want to drink them, though it helps with lighter wines too. Really opens them up and releases the aromas.<br /><br />The 7-piece set is a great gift as well and not too expensive on Amazon!

review/summary: Amazing Product, Would skip the package deal though.
review/text: The aerator is amazing, no question about it. Even doubtful people notice a difference. I got the 6 piece set as a gift for my husband and thought the stand was a great idea. After reading the reviews on this product I concluded that some people had an issue with making a mess while others don't when they pour wine using the stand. So I thought maybe we will figure it out. Well I can see that when it is poured a precise way that it doesn't make a mess but if you slightly increase the flow that you pour the wine or the angle that you are pouring it will automatically pour out the aerator holes. Seriously annoying. We tried a few times and gave up. It's so much easier to just hold the aerator over the glass of wine and use the small stand when not in use. We will most likely never use the large stand again even though it looks great, functionality is more important. And if you're a big wine drinker I'm sure it will get more difficult with each glass of wine poured. If I could do it again I would skip the 6 piece set and go straight for aerator itself, this will save you a lot of frustration and some cash.

review/summary: could have been great, but...
review/text: Great idea and you can taste the difference in wine after poring it through the aerator. But if you put it on the tower and even a tall wine glass under it, wine sprays all over the place but not into the glass. You must tilt the aerator to prevent it.  Design could have been a lot better if they have tried to pour wine as it is. Buy just the aerator; the tower is just a piece of decoration.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I was skeptical about this product when my husband got it for me for Christmas, but when I did a comparison of a glass of wine poured with it and without, it was amazing how much smoother the wine tasted!  It even helps when you've opened a bottle of wine and then put it in the frig for a few days and it starts to taste a little bitter.  We ended up ordering a separate aerator for white wines (and zinfandels) too.  It would be nice if they offered a set that came with both, but the set only includes the aerator for red wines.  A little pricey at regular price but we found it on Amazon after Christmas for 40% off!

review/summary: GREAT FOR WINE ENTHUSIASTS, GREAT FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO IMPROVE WINE-DRINKING
review/text: I discovered the Vinturi having a glass of wine at a friend's house.  They were so enthusiastic that we did a side-by-side taste test - wine poured through the vinturi and wine from the bottle.  It was amazing.  The Vinturi miraculously improves wine by aearateing it instantly.  I gave six of these as gifts this year..  You don't really need the Lucite arm accessory but it's nice to have if you have the space.  The Vinturi is conveniently sized so that you can easily take it with you on a picnic.  AND by using Amazon, the price was 20% to 30% less than buying it in a store.

review/text: Great gift box! I have ordered six of these in the past and the recepients rave about them. I myself, enjoy mine every day. No longer is it necessary to open to aerate for 30 to 90 minutes before driniking the first and subsequent glasses of your favorite wine. One friend of mine raved about it, and saw a demonstration at wine tasting event in napa wine country. His first thoughts: this is a lot of houghey(bull). He belongs to moderate sized wine club that gathers once a month. His impression: what an amazing difference! He became a believer!

review/summary: Works amazingly! but does NOT come with travel pouch!
review/text: After reading about 100 reviews on this aerator on you tube and other sites, my husband and I decided to give it a go. Boy am i glad we did! We have only owned it for a few days now, and i have tried a few various red wines... from expensive wines from Portugal to cheap wines such as Yellow Tail... and the taste difference is notable. The nose difference alone is incredible. I even tried it with Sangria and it made it more fruity!!<br /><br />I only have a small gripe with the stand, but its nothing that really gets me angry, or nothing that will make me stop using it by any means... When you use the aerator in the tower, it leaks out of the air holes in the sides and drips down the tower. Not a lot, just a drop or 2 here and there. Now i tried pouring slow, fast, sideways, etc... and there is just no way around it when the aerator is being held straight, as the tower holds it. Now if you hold the aerator by hand, and tilt it slightly over the glass when you pour, no drips! LIke i said, this is a small issue and does not effect the way i feel about my new "wine-erator" as me and my friend call it!!!<br /><br />I am a little heated that it does not come with the travel pouch as shown in a few pictures and also described in the description. It doesnt show it in the box section, but it says in another part that it is included, and its on the pictures, so dont be mislead. I beleive there is an "essential kit" which would include that pouch, but for the price that amazon is selling it vs bed bath, wine enthusiasts, and everyone else, its worth not having the pouch.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Aerates the wine, but makes a mess
review/text: I got this as a birthday gift a couple months ago and only just had a chance to really take it for a test drive.  I agree with most of the reviews that it really makes a difference in the flavor of the wine.  However, I'm a bit frustrated with how messy it is.  The wine spurts out the two air holes and ends up all over the stand and the table.  I've tried pouring faster and slower in a vain attempt to prevent the mess, but I haven't been successful yet.  The only way I've found to address the problem is by wrapping a paper towel loosely around the cone before putting it in the stand so it soaks up the wine before it has a chance to drip all over the place.  This is the only wine aerator I've ever used, so for all I know this might be a common problem with all of them.  At least the wine tastes better...

review/text: My friend had this @ our last dinner party; I liked it and purchased one.  It definitely helps the wine open up & breath much quicker.  I only gave it 4 stars because it leaks a little bit down the back of the stand, which gets on the bottom of the wine glass.  Everytime you use it, you must wipe the bottom of the glass. Still, a good buy if you drink wine.

review/text: The Vinturi Deluxe Aerator Set was a present we bought for our daughter.<br />She is very pleased with it and it looks good on her counter with the stand and all. (It was on her Christmas list.)<br /><br />We have a plain Vinturi without the stand and use it regularly to decant wines. We seldom think to open a bottle before we want to drink it, so this "opens" the wine and brings out its best flavors and nose instant gratification style.<br /><br />The stand would be a little handier to use and provides a good place to keep the Vinturi.

review/summary: What were they thinking...
review/text: We were very excited to receive our Vinturi wine aerator from Amazon until we used it for the first time.  The small vent holes on either side of the Venturi pipe simultaneously suck air in (good) and leak wine out all over your countertop (bad).  We have tried it with multiple wines pouring at all different speeds and volumes.  Same result...leaking red wine down the sides of the housing.  We bought another one this weekend from a local "big box" store thinking we may have received a defective unit.  Nope.  Same performance, same poor engineering.  If they would have angled the inlet holes slightly upward (uphill), this probably would not have been a problem, but they didn't.  Since Amazon only gives a one month return policy on this product we are stuck with it. We will be returning the second one to the big box store ASAP.  As for the first one,it is out of Amazon's one-month warranty.  It is useless as a wine improver, but we are looking at lampshades right now so we can get some use out of it.

review/summary: Should have listened to the reviews that were bad...
review/text: I own a Vinturi Spirit Aerator and love it.  I figured, what the heck, it can't be as bad as they say... I was wrong.  The tower is STUPID and here is why...  The filter that sits inside of the top of the aerator slows down the stream of wine.  If you aren't dead center with that stream, the wine goes to the left or the right of the filter.  Then it drips down to the aeration vents and leaks out and down your tower.  The very first glass of wine I poured, I poured extremely slow as a precaution listed by other amazon members.  As slow as molasses.  But, because my hand barely moved, the wine did what I mentioned it would do if you weren't dead center with your stream.  In my opinion, the tower is just for display and is a piece of junk otherwise.  Just buy the Red Wine Aerator without the Tower and save yourself the ridiculous excitement.

I used it tonight with a 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon and it did indeed taste better. Nice gift or something to buy for yourself.

review/text: I became interested in the Vinturi after seeing it used at a restaurant, challenging the waitstaff as to whether or not it actually did anything, and being surprised to taste that it did actually taste better.  So, I am sold on the Vinturi.<br /><br />My wife really enjoys wine, so I bought her this set for Christmas.  I was extremely disappointed and embarassed to find out that it spills wine all over!  If you use it with the tower, it will drip out of the vent holes and down the arm of the tower.  From there, it will either get all over your counter, or pool at the base of your wine glass.  You basically have to wipe everything down after each glass.  It's a huge pain.<br /><br />If you use the Vinturi by itself, it still spills, but at least there is a clear path for the wine to drip down into the wine glass you are pouring into.<br /><br />Sorry, but the effectiveness of the Vinturi is not enough to save the tower/Vinturi combo from my one star rating.  It failed when it did not meet the most basic of my expectations... that it would not leak when used.

I would have given it a five star however, a small amount of wine runs down the tower each time, which means a clean-up.  Perhaps I have'nt got it exactly right and will continue to experiment.  The tower design allows it to fit nicely under the cabinets, does not take any more space than a bottle of wine, and is a nice ascetic addition to my counter.

We like the little holder for it, so we can keep it right by the sink since we're usually on a drip-feed of wine all evening.  I'd forget the big holder -- more junk for the countertop.

review/text: I've enjoyed a nice glass of wine for a long time, but until recently I have not understood the concept of letting wine "breathe" before pouring. A couple of months ago I became acquainted with a couple who are quite knowledgeable about wines. While at dinner they brought out a bottle of moderately priced wine and the Vinturi aerator. I was intrigued with this clever gadget and sampled a glass poured through the aerator and one not. There was a distinctive difference in the taste of the wine. You might guess which one was better. Well, I had to invest in one of these little gadgets myself and couldn't be happier! Since, I've been telling every wine love I know about this clever gadget. Though you can purchase the aerator by itself, I recommend the deluxe set. It makes for quite a conversation piece sitting on your counter or buffet. Try it! You'll like it!  It's a great gift too!! I found the best price at Amazon, naturally,
