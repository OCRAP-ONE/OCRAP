review/summary: WOW
review/text: I have 3 very picky dogs. Over the years I have tried and failed with many foods and treats. I finally got them off home cooking with the companies dry food (limited ingredient formula Duck and Potato small bits), so I figured, lets also try the roll.<br />They loved it instantly!!! All 3 of them :)<br /><br />Of course I use it like a treat because I frankly could not afford it as main food source.

review/summary: Moist Training Treat
review/text: The Natural Balance Duck and Potato Formula Roll Treat is my dog's favorite flavor of this product.  I use it exclusively as a training reward. My dog actually prefers it to dry treats because of its moist, easy to gobble/swallow formula. In comparison, when I give her dry treats, she often looks for water to go with them.<br /><br />Unlike some reviewers, I have not found the roll to be dry and crumbly. I do refrigerate it when it arrives, even before I open the package. And when I do open the roll, I keep it tightly wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated to preserve freshness. For use as training treats, I usually cut a 1/2 inch slice off the roll, then dice it into 1/4 inch cubes which I carry in a plastic sandwich bag. It is easy to handle, holds it shape and is not messy. Any leftovers are refrigerated for the next training session.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, you can cut a piece off and crumble it over dry dog kibble to enhance the flavor. I have purchased this item about a dozen times over the past 18 months. I had a problem one time with "dry" product texture and "off" odor - I returned it with no problem.<br /><br />My disappointment is with the significant price increase on Amazon from $7.99 to $12.91 for a 1 pound roll. I found an alternative store locally, Pet Nutrition Center, where I bought it today for $6.99 plus tax ($7.53 total). My local Petco sells the roll for $7.99 plus tax. Amazon's price increase is the reason for my 4 star not 5 star rating of this product on Amazon. Even with free shipping, it is not worth $12.91.

review/text: I would recommend this product, it has become a staple seasoning in my kitchen.  I have been using this seasoning for several years now.  My local grocery store seems to not be carrying it now - which has me looking for it on Amazon.  We usually use this when making rice (it works well with other grains too), and there are a number of features that I appreciate:<br />- no MSG (unlike the packets made by a competitor)<br />- I can vary the quantity based on how much rice or grain I'm cooking (unlike the packets made by a competitor)<br />- I can use with brown rice (and my kids think it is normal yellow rice!)

review/summary: One Box of Interesting Tea.
review/text: It is one box of interesting tea. I thought it said 2 boxes of 100 bags but it is just one box. I enjoy many black teas and green teas. This was my first cup of an Asian black tea. All previous black tea before this was mostly orange and black pekoe cut tea (Lipton, Red Rose, the "normal tea"). My sister said it reminded her of twigs and leaves with a hint of smokiness. I thought it reminded me a bit like a ginger tea. It didn't taste like a cheap or poor tea to me but not an incredibly high quality either. I don't know if I will buy it again because I didn't LOVE the flavor but it was not bad at all.

review/summary: Pu Erh - Dr. Oz Recommended
review/text: I had heard of this tea from watching Dr. Oz. Picked up a recent Woman's World magazine and they had a recipe for an iced tea with Pu Erh, White Tea, ginger, and lemon juice. The combination tastes great. I drink coffee black and found I had no need for sweeteners in this tea combo. I am on day 2 of drinking this and found it does suppress appetite and gives me as good, if not better, revving than coffee. So far, I'm happy with this tea. I haven't tried drinking it by itself, though.

review/summary: DELICIOUS "chips/junk food" alternative
review/text: I found this at Costco and got one to try. It really satisfies the "crunch" craving of chips but is also somewhat chewier akin to jerky. The ingredients are simply: organic apples & organic cinnamon so there's *nothing* added. 58 calories a serving makes this extremely guilt free.<br /><br />I'm one of those who sometimes has to snack on something while watching TV. Because it takes a little more time to chew them, I can give in to the (bad) urge to eat to just be chewing on something and still not eat that much in a sitting. And its all healthy. Great fiber.<br /><br />Just one word of caution: as tasty as they are, don't eat very much at first because it seems to expand in your stomach a little so can cause a stomachache if too much.<br /><br />I'm happy to see that Bare Fruit has partnered up with Amazon to provide a way to order this online for reasonable amount. Especially as I discovered yesterday that my local Costco only has them on a closeout basis (when sold out, that's it). They're selling the 14oz bag for about 40c/oz but 57c/oz on Amazon is still worthwhile as I'm not buying other pricy junk foods anymore. I look forward to trying the other baked dried fruits from Bake Fruit.

review/summary: Slightly Addictive Healthy Treat!
review/text: *****<br />These apple chips are sweet, very crispy, and yummy! They don't have the processed or chemically taste that some dried apples have. They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />These particular apple chips from Bare Fruit (I like them all) are very sweet and taste especially delicious (slightly addictive) because of the added organic cinnamon.<br /><br />I would also recommend buying these chips in smaller bags (the 2.6 ounce size) unless quite a few people are going to be eating these rather quickly. The reason is that exposure to moisture can render these crispy chips too soft. I like buying them in the smaller bags and then repackaging them in a resealable plastic bag to get rid of all of the extra air. Then I take out only what I plan to eat and quickly reseal the bag. My chips are always crispy this way.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: Like a number of other reviewers I found these at costco. Immediate impression was that these are really wonderful tasting and the crunch gave me satisfaction that I was really chewing something up. I really enjoy yogurt but it's nice to have something to chew on. I also had a difficult time believing that there was nothing there but apples and cinnamon. EVERYTHING these days has one additive or another and it's usually not good for you to some degree. The best part? No sulfur dioxide (if you know what I mean...). I highly recommend these.<br /><br />On a related note, I was excited to see this company also offers other dried fruits as well.

review/text: Like many other reviewers, I first found these apple chips at Costco, who has since discontinued them.  If I'd known they were going to be discontinued, I would have stocked up because they were about 50% cheaper!  But still the Amazon price is a good deal for such a large quantity of dried apples.  I eat them as a snack (I keep a bag at the office for this purpose) and I also use them as treats for my pet bunny (he goes absolutely bonkers for them). The quality is great; I haven't found a single seed or inedible piece in the four bags I've gone through so far.  Plus they are organic, which I do not normally care about but becomes important if you are ingesting any quantity of peels. Definitely recommend!!

review/text: I have been eating Bare Fruit for quite some time, and I love this larger (14 oz) size. It is so economical and affordable. The Cinnamon Apple Chips are my favorite flavor. They make a terrific on-the-go snack and last about 2 weeks in my household (14 one ounce servings). A sweet, healthy alternative to candy or chips.

review/summary: Found a sticker melted on one of the pieces!
review/text: I just found part of a sticker (those little stickers attached to most fruits at the store) melted to one of the apple pieces!  They do a lousy job in cleaning the fruit.  The reason I took off another star is because there are some dirty apple chips in the bag.  I suppose it's from the bottom of the apple stem where it can be a little dirty or furry and they just bake the whole part!  They need a bit more quality control.  I end up throwing out between 5%-10% of the apples because they contain a stem, dirty, etc.<br /><br />9/23/13: Found another sticker attached to an apple piece.  Customer service only takes the information, but does nothing.

review/text: I bought these thinking I'd drink them "straight," but found I prefer them as flavor enhancements to other beverages.  I've tried adding them to plain iced tea, which gives it a nice fruity taste, as well as to my breakfast protein smoothies.  They don't add much in the way of carbs or calories, so it's a great way to add some fruity flavor to those drinks.  I really think they'd do well if advertised as if designed for this purpose!  I've tried all 4 flavors and did the same with all of them.

review/text: This is O.K., it tastes a bit artificial to me.  I have had this about 8 weeks.  I have only opened one can so far. It kind of reminded my of the artificial strawberry sauce that one often gets on ice cream.  (I don't eat strawberry sauce because of it's artificial taste, which is sicking sweet and has an aftertaste.) It is not as sweet as the artificial strawberry sauce, but it does have a bit of an after taste. maybe from the can.  ????  I cannot decide if I want to purchase more or not.  The price is OK but the taste, I cannot decide if it is worth the money or not.

review/text: This is only my second ever loose leaf tea. I now feel like I have been drinking second rate tea all these years! I put two teaspoons of the aromatic tea into my new ForLife Tea Infuser that I bought off Amazon as well, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JPA3Y8">FORLIFE Brew-in-Mug Extra-Fine Tea Infuser with Lid</a>, then poured 16 ounces of hot water over the tea. I waited about 10 minutes (because I like strong tea) and oh my goodness! I definitely didn't need to wait that long. Like I said, I am used to tea that comes in bags and you need to wait a good while in order to get a strong drink. This tea is delicious. Everyone who walked in my office was asking "what is that smell, did you get an air freshner?" lol. I'm looking forward to trying out more of the Tea Forte teas I see offered on Amazon.

review/summary: Easiest healthy meal to cook!
review/text: In the past few years, I started "growing" in the stomach region... so I decided to start eating better<br /><br />I'm not much of a cook so I tried those already-made Tofu Burgers that they sell in the stores that you just heat up, but unfortunately, they did not suit my palate.<br />Plus, I don't really know what they use for flavoring and what not...<br /><br />This TOFU BURGER MIX on the other hand, I can tailor the flavor however I want.<br />After a little research, I found out that FIRM or EXTRA FIRM TOFU works better.<br /><br />Grab that plastic tub of tofu and stick your hand on top and flip it upside down, over the sink and start pushing any excess water out.<br />Then flip it back over and throw it in a bigger bowl to start mushing down.<br />Rip open a package of this stuff and pour it in with the tofu and start mushing it some more.<br /><br />Get some vegetable oil, make little balls of this tofu mixture and throw it on the frying pan.<br /><br />Personally, I found that SO-MEN TSUYU(sauce) works best for me. Very light flavor.<br />I actually throw in some zucchinis and fry it next to the tofu burger with the SO-MEN TSUYU.<br /><br />In my experience, one package is good for about 4-5 people.<br />I think it's a great way to start a healthy diet.

review/text: To make some tofu burger, all you need is a pack of this mix and a pack of tofu. Just squeeze the tofu to get the liquid as much as possible, and just mix in! It'll be a perfect consistency after kneading a bit, and can make 4 patties out of it (it states it'll make 5 patties but I found the size too small). Just have some canola oil in the pan over medium heat, and cook both side and you have your dinner! The ingredients of this mix is the followings: bread crumbs, onion, sugar, sesame, potato, salt, soy protein concentrate, cornstarch, soy sauce, autolyzed yeast extract, yam, roasted garlic powder (garlic, palm oil), vegetable bouillon (cornstarch, onion, potato, carrot), xanthan gum, citric acid.

review/text: Tofu burger is a yummy tasting way to add something extra to the tofu.  It adds flavor and texture to your tofu, which is quite pleasing to the palet.  The product easily mixes into the tofu.  Even using this product, I still add a little extra dried onion and garlic, or all spice.  However, I perfer things on the hot and spicey side.

review/summary: Great tasting, balanced protein & fat, LOW phosphorous, great for cat with kidney problem
review/text: My cat just love them, chomping down the kibbles. He has started to gain weight & muscle back, and I am very happy with the results. I also add 1/4 cup of NON salted chicken soup after the food. I'll be doing another blood test in 6 months. Will do future update.<br /><br />My two years young cat has high blood level BUN (60) and creatinnine (1.9), vomiting and not eating, and vet recommended changing food. He was on high protein diet, and I was surprise to learn that some type of cat are more sensitive to protein/phosphorous level. Chose "Now! Dry Cat Food for Adult Cats, Grain Free Turkey with Duck" because it has the lowest phosphorous dry adult cat food I can find, without going the prescription food route. The phosphorous level is 0.65% dry matter, considered to be on the low but acceptable. The protein(30%) quality is high, grain free and acceptable fat(18%) level. Most other non-prescription dry kibbles phosphorous range from 0.60% to 2%. Only prescription food can be lower than 0.5%. Phosphorous is important to health, but must be on lower range for pets with that are phosphorous sensitive.<br /><br />Price of food is on par with other grain free, non rendered meats pet food. I witnessed fantastic results in  my cat, who is now normal weight masculine happy active cat :-) ... woo hoo!!! MEOW!!! =>o&lt;=

review/summary: Without hesitation--the BEST grits!
review/text: I have had many different kinds of grits and these are superior to all.  They are "slow-cooking" grits, which are the best in my opinion.  The texture is amazing and it is hard to eat any other brand after having these.  Now, since they are slow-cooking grits, the directions say they take 1 hour to cook.  That is easily remedied by simply pre-soaking the grits the night before you cook them.  After 8 hours of soaking overnight, they take a mere 15-20 minutes to cook.  Not to mention if you need them to be ready for dinner, the grits "pre-soaking time" can be dramatically reduced to 3-4 hours if you soak them in HOT water.<br /><br />All that being said, I noticed for several different kinds of grits sold on Amazon that many reviewers claim those grits to be the best they had.  It begs the question, what is so distinctive about Carolina Plantation grits?  Simple put: the texture.  Unlike most grits (especially quick cooking grits), Carolina Plantation grits have a nutty texture to them.  It is the difference between regular oatmeal vs steel cut oats.  These grits are robust and you can taste all the tiny "kernals" as you eat a mouthful.<br /><br />Thus if you prefer the more "porridge" texture for grits, then do not get these.  However, if you like a more nutty texture, Carolina Plantation grits are unsurpassed!<br /><br />UPDATE:  As of 2-23-11, the grits are "currently unavailable".  Just type in "CAROLINA PLANTATION" in Google and their website pulls up easily.  The prices on their website is still reasonable.  Enjoy!

I would have rated it 5 stars but the packing was poor and some of the cookies were damaged.  Other than that, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and set up an automatic shipment option.

review/text: Bellino Savoiardi Lady Fingers are the best!!!  They are not the spongy American style fingers you get in the store. However, they are NOT the large, fat, lady fingers I was expecting. I was making Tirimisu and wanted something better than was available; in fact the recipe suggested Savoiardi. I saw the advertisement and ordered a box. What I didn't understand was that I was getting a BIG box and will have enough lady fingers to make several 9x13 pans of dessert, which my body can not afford.  The "fingers" are excellent and I would highly recommend them. A 9x13 inch dish will hold about 18 fingers per layer and obviously, two layers would use 36 fingers, so you can add that into your planning when you order.

review/text: I am Hispanic and the first Lady Fingers I tried were Goya when I was a child and they were naturally hard and crunchy, I carried this memory for years into adulthood and after discovering that Amazon had Lady Fingers I ordered what I could find without repent and it turned out to be this Italian brand. I was disappointed at first-I wanted them to be hard and they were too soft for my palette [keep in mind that I have no desire to make Tiramisu and just want to eat these cookies] but after a while I grew to love them even more than the Goya ones [I ordered the right ones later] but their incomparable taste stayed poignant to my delicate taste buds [I'm helplessly picky] and now while I still enjoy Goya my favorite are by far these Savoiardi Lady Fingers. Enjoy them! ^_~ Although I must say I find  rather wasteful when people try to make Tiramasu out of the Goya Lady Fingers. Sadly, it doesn't matter how much you soak them in milk they will remain hard and are meant to be hard! Choose Savoiardi if Tiramisu is what you are after.<br /><br /> It's just a matter of choice.<br /><br />Although my mom likes to make Tiramasu out of the French brand. Personal choice. I just like to savor them and not the cake. Though if you want to bake cake since Savoiardi and Tiramisu are Italian it is oddly fitting.<br /><br />-Dani.

review/summary: WAY WAY OVERPRICED
review/text: My local Wal-Mart quit carrying cinnamon mints, so I decided to order online. I was accustomed to purchasing a 2 pound bag for about $2.99. The product was good, but outrageously expensive for the small bags I received in my order (about $48 for 12 bags which should have sold in a store for, perhaps, $1.50 each). Unfortunately, the product description on the order page was not clear as to the weight, and I was left feeling like a fool for spending so much for so little.

review/text: I got these grapes as a gift.  Upon opening the box I had no idea what I was getting...and then I opened a ziploc of a handful of grapes that say "FRESH RED GRAPES" in sharpie marker on the bag.  These were not sent priority mail nor was there an ice pack with them.  If someone is selling grapes I would at least expect them to come in some sort of packaging.  Also, I noticed that shipping was more than the price of the grapes and way more than needed to send them.  Overall, I feel the sellers took advantage.  Needless to say, I will not be eating these.  They are questionable.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: This tea is quite disappointing. Even brewing using the standard lower temperature hot water for gyokuro, the Adagio tea has a very sharp, bitter afternote that I don't expect, especially in one that costs as much as Adagio charges for it.<br /><br />I'm sure the best gyokuro doesn't leave Japan, and certainly I've tasted a few while there and brought a pack home which I put head-to-head with this. In my opinion, gyokuro isn't supposed to have a subtle flavor. The richness of proteins produced from the shaded leaves should be clearly evident on the palate and in aroma, but very mellow on the tongue. The difference that I find: Adagio gyokuro has a much thinner, less umami flavor for the same volume of tea leaves used, and it has the bitter aftertaste that is completely absent in the higher quality batch (which, in contrast, doesn't even have a bitter note if brewing at boiling water, which really shouldn't be done anyway). Dropping the water temperature or brewing time for the Adagio leaves doesn't do anything to prevent the bitter taste.<br /><br />Conclusion: bitter, un-rich tasting gyokuro. One star awarded above lowest rating for actually being gyokuro. Avoid.<br /><br />I'm going to have to find another brand of something else soon to replace what I'm running out of!

review/text: The Adagio tea seems expensive till you try it.  Suddenly, every other tea you've tried - whether it's bags from Whole Foods/Giant/Safeway or "Designer teas" from expensive shops - seems harsh and loud by comparison.  This tea is subtle and soft yet unmistakably a high quality Japanese green tea.  Very mild and light aroma, a refined and smooth taste and no aftertaste unless you steep it too long.  It makes you want to reach for another cup immediately.  Easy enough to do since it can be steeped more than once, though I find that if you wait too long for the second steeping it has lost some of its body.<br /><br />Overall, I thought it was excellent and will be ordering more shortly.

review/text: Whoever came up with this is a genius and a lifesaver. I too only use formula when I'm on the go or need to supplement if I don't have enough breast milk, so the can is a waste since I won't finish it in a month. The packets are so convenient. I carry a bottle or two of 4oz water and a couple of packets in my purse at all times for emergencies. Paid $10.69 for a box of 16 at Target.<br /><br />Only 4 out of 5 stars because you can only make 4 oz or 8 oz.  So if your baby is currently eating more than 4oz but less than 8oz you either hope he is satisfied with 4oz or make 8oz and waste some.

review/summary: Expensive and MESSY.
review/text: I was buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IYDXVE">Enfamil Premium Lipil Single Serve Powder Packets 17.4 g Sticks, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, they will make 4oz of formula and are in packages just like sports drinks...HOWEVER the packaging SUCKS. Baby formula does not pour well and can get caught in the tinest of wrinkle and then come rushing out when it makes it way past. It's very light and fluffy so spills go everywhere. The single serve sticks are also larger, longer in length and can take up space in your diaper bag, you can't fold them up it's just awkward all around, especially to pour them in the car or at the mall, etc. Not to mention EXPENSIVE. Really EXPENSIVE, 8 packs for $12-$16. Meaning 8 bottles for that, when a whole formula case is $25. MAKE YOUR OWN SINGLE SERVE SOLUTIONS! I really can't express to you how awful the packaging is on these, they spill every single time, I'm no butterfingers so I know it's not me. The tear wrong, the formula comes gushing out after you try to coax it down when it gets stuck no matter how hard you try to flatten it out before you open. All in all, this is a great idea in theory, it just fails in design.<br /><br />Here are two cheaper and more efficient solutions:<br /><br /> Most moms have and use either the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFCXIK">Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors Vary</a> or a variant of it ( hear its not as good as this one and I believe it). We got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006BAJIG">Philips AVENT Formula BPA-Free Dispenser/Snack Cup</a>and I think it's excellent quality and wonderful, the dividers do not "leak" into each other at all since it's one piece mold, and you can just take it out if you want to use for snacks, it's a must have. That said, its so big in my diaper bag. I like to have as much room in my bag as I can, and every inch counts.<br /><br />So I got These plastic bags make it possible. Plus if I have sports powdered mixes, etc I can use these as well for myself.  Why not make your own single serve pouches? I looked into a few kinds and these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EDINH8">500 Poly Bag Clear Zipper Shipping Bags 3" X 4"</a> were the best economically, (bags for cost) I can pack 3 or 4 bottles worth in the same space that a pack of altoids would take up, less actually. About 2 or 3 on top of each other is the thickness of my iphone 4. I can fit about 8 bags inside the avent formula dispenser. This is way better than the size more conventional formula dispensers hold. The best way to pour it into your cup or baby bottle ( from experience ) is to pinch it at the ziplock seam, open it so that the left corner is touching the right corner, and pour it out. Never spill a drop, no mess all over the place, love it.<br /><br />That said I would NEVER Give up the avent formula dispenser, I actually bought another because I love using them at home. I sit these out on the counter and I don't have to clutter up the kitchen, plus when a baby sitter comes over I just tell her pour one compartment into the bottle and shake. I also fill up bottles of water and have them waiting at the ready so I practically have to  nothing to make a bottle when I am tired or relying on others. These are a must have. If you don't want to fuss with the baggies, I would say this is the best compact formula dispenser for your money and on the market, hands down it sweeps the competition. Don't buy the cheaper ones, their dividers SUCK and the lid is iffy. This is the one that works best. Also, the best way to pout it out and get it all out quick and fast is to line up the hole with the bottle and SHAKE SIDE TO SIDE Rapidly. Back and forth, left to right, three or four times and it's all out! Don't worry, you wont spill and the formula wont get mixed up in the compartments.<br /><br />These options are the best value for your money. You have a new baby, you have PLENTY of other things to spend your money on, the list never ends babies suck you dry, so don't waste the money on these if you don't have to. Hope this helps.

review/text: I ordered this for my birthday. I got birthday money from family, and I ordered a couple of goodies, perfume, and this cocoa.  I love hot chocolate, and I'm always looking for new ones to try.  Based on the first review I decided to go ahead and order.  I will probably not reorder.  Mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness.  It also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste.  I like Hershey's Bliss Raspberry Chocolate much better.  I've been adding one spoonful of the Cobblestone Kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost.  But, by itself, it does not stand up to the test. I plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa.

I recently read some online reviews on hot chocolate and this brand received rave reviews.  I've tried both the organic and the old world and both are fabulous.  The organic is a powder mix and the old world is chocolate shavings. I guess I'd say the old world is more intense and rich, but you can control the strength by how much you add to your hot milk. Both are definately worth the extra money and makes a nice holiday gift (with a couple festive mugs).  You can also find this brand at Whole Foods Market.

review/summary: Cocoa Mojo : )
review/text: I was very lucky to receive a gift package of Lake Champlain hot cocoa mixes. Very lucky. The three varieties included were: Traditional, Mocha, and Aztec. Three wonderfully chunky one pound cans of hot cocoa mix. Oh, boy! This is an all-natural product without additives or preservatives. The Lake Champlain company has been reverentially producing chocolate goodness from its factory in Vermont for over 25 years. They offer a variety of chocolate indulgences, including gift baskets and gift samplers. In addition to the addictive hot cocoas, they also tempt you with truffles, caramels, chocolate bars and other items of divine decadence. The hot cocoa mixes are rich and satisfying, made with milk and soothing to the soul and the senses. The flavors of the mixes are so full-bodied that I even added spoonfuls of the hot cocoa mix into the batter for brownies, cookies, cakes and etc. I also made my own gourmet mocha madness mixes by combining the hot cocoa dry mix with instant coffee granules and powdered creamer. I had my own private stash at work, and the scent of my cocoa-powered coffee creations had others asking what I was drinking. I was benevolent and shared some of the mix. I think I started something ; )

Thinking this may be a good substitute,I purchased this tea.  It turns bitter.  It cannot be brewed longer than one minute, and goes bitter once it cools.  This tea is the worst, and is money down the drain.  It is so bad that I will not donate it to the food pantry.  This is going to the landfill.

review/summary: Keeps Dogs Very Busy
review/text: I've bought a couple of these for my Airedale puppy who constantly wants to chew.  These things are amazing in that they have bone, tendon, meat, and knuckles still attached.  She dives in and tears it apart - she would work on it non-stop if I didn't periodically take it away from her.  The meat and tendons are harmless enough - obviously they have fat and protein so they have to be tied into diet considerations, and the bone appears to hold onto the flavor long after it's stripped (she still licks and gnaws on a bone that's a few weeks bare).  The knuckles, once they get torn off, should probably be thrown away after a few minutes because they are small enough to be swallowed and/or choked on.  The only downside to this product is when she comes up to me and the whiskers around her mouth are a little discolored and she smells like roasted meat.  But, well worth it if you want to give your dog a treat that they can't get enough of.

review/summary: Dog loves it
review/text: I got this for a big American Bulldog.  He LOVES it.  He gobbled up the meat and tendons in no time.  I may have to take it away if he starts breaking chunks off.  So far it's fine and he's never been so happy.  These things are major bones.  I'd only recommend it for a very large tough dog though.

review/summary: This thing is unreal.....
review/text: I have two extremely aggressive chewers, a Lab and a Dalmatian....and this bone keeps them busy for DAYS.  You do have to watch when the smaller top bones separate from the rest of the bone as they are chewed, they could be a choking hazard.  The Sarge keeps both of my dogs interested, even when the marrow and tendons have long since been eaten.  Great value for the price, considering they last so long.  If you want a bone that stimulates and satisfies, this is it!
