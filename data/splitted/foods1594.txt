review/text: I received this in the mail this morning and tore the package open excitedly, because I've been craving some beef jerky lately.  But oh my goodness, I couldn't even swallow the first piece.  Even my dog stopped eating them after 2 pieces.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the flavor other than salty and metallic (I got the Teriyaki).  The jerky is also alarmingly thick and covered with this sawdust-like powder, and most of the pieces have broken up into crumbs.<br /><br />I will definitely not be finishing the bag I opened, and hopefully I'll be able to give the other 5 bags to someone who is hungry enough to take them.  I'm not one to complain about products, but I've also never felt so strongly about spreading the news to stay away from this stuff.

review/summary: Impressive, Tasty Protein Snack!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this beef jerky!  I am the Executive Director for an organization called The Women's Wilderness Institute.  We offer multi-day wilderness experiences for girls and women, and I have Wild Ride Beef Jerky going out on all our courses.  The participants LOVE a protein snack option, and I feel proud to be able to offer the high-quality, natural snack.<br />I climb mountains in my spare time, and Wild Ride Beef Jerky is always with me.  I crave protein on extended days, and the taste and texture is superior to other brands on the market.<br />I am also allergic to gluten, and most of the cheaper brands use wheat fillers.  I totally trust Wild Ride to deliver consistent, yummy, gluten-free, natural, and high quality protein snacks for me!

review/summary: Good price, great texture
review/text: I like beef jerky to be tender, not leathery and near impossible to chew through. This beef jerky comes in perfectly sized pieces and is very tender, probably even more tender than my favorite brand, Pemmican.<br /><br />As for the flavor, it's not very strong. There is some flavor but the tenderness of the beef makes up for the lack of flavor. It also isn't as salty as other brands of beef jerky that I've had before. Overall it's a great buy and I recommend it.

review/summary: Almost worst jerky I've ever had!
review/text: This stuff is terrible! It's not hot & spicy in any way, unless you can count the coating of chili powder all over it & the bag. The jerky itself has NO flavor at all. I repeatedly tried it over and over, hoping it was just a bad piece/batch/bag, but it was all the same - terrible, terrible flavor. If you think this will be ANYTHING like Jack Link's peppered jerky, or ANY peppered/hot jerky for that matter, you're going to be very disappointed.

review/summary: Not so good......
review/text: I am someone who LOVES beef jerky and I was hoping this tasted better than it does.  It has a very strange texture (a dry mushy testure - if there is such a thing) and the taste was strange (carboard like and bland).  I like to buy healthy snacks and food items so I was hoping this would taste much better.  I was expecting a difference in taste and texture due to the lack of MSG which does add a lot of salt flavor and texture to traditional beef jerky BUT this just out right does not taste good. I can sacrifice for the benefit of a more natural product but I found this jerky to be beyond my threshold of tolerance.<br /><br />  I am hoping to try and use it as dog treats so the purchase is not a complete waste and also add a bag to my hurricane supplies (as a food of last resort).  I would suggest trying to locate this product locally and trying it before you buy it in the bulk 6 bag size from Amazon to make sure it is a taste and texture you would like, we didn't!

review/summary: Flavorful, but not incredible
review/text: I have tryed the majority of spicy jerky on the market.  I can't say that Wild Ride Gallopin Pepper was my favorite, but it does have decent flavor.  The character of the poduct is a smoky flavor with a little spice, but being one who likes hot foods, it didn't have enough to get my engine running.  I think it is a decent product, but at least the shipment I got was extremely dry.  I know it is jerky, so it's like it is supposed to be dry, but other brands I have had like World Kitches seem to retain a little more of the natural oils and juices.  I would eat this again, but given the choice other brands seem to give me the kick I'm looking for more than this.

review/summary: Not zero carbs
review/text: I was looking everywhere for a really low or zero carb jerky because I'm on one of those diets where I'm not supposed to consume any sugar. Found this zero carb jerky, which I just went back and double checked the page from which I purchased it and it definitely says "zero carbs" under product description, abut turns out that it has 5 grams of sugar per ounce and 6 grams of carbohydrates. I already cracked a bag open and started eating it before flipping it over to discover this. Very unhappy and disappointed, I already had great beef jerky (with sugar in it) at home and didn't buy this expensive jerky so that I could have more. They need to be clear on the product description because the little picture isn't big enough to see if it says zero carbs on it or not.

This jerky has almost a medicinal type flavor with a little heat thrown in to try and mask the awfulness.  I could not be more disappointed in a purchase and would return to Amazon if I was in to cheap to pay shipping.  I highly suggest you try and find this brand locally to test it out before buying the bulk here.

review/text: I've been a fan of Jerky for years.  I bought, tasted, and nearly gagged on the GALLOPIN' PEPPER flavor Wild Ride Jerky.  It is not spicy, it is mushy, lacks the expected standard beef jerky texture, and is like eating (I imagine) sour-ish cardboard. Save your money and pass on this one.

review/text: First this product excels because it isn't loaded with nasty preservatives, chemicals or other nasty junk, just the good stuff.  The meat itself is perfection, I haven't ever found any fat or hard bits, always just the right moisture and texture good quality tender meat.  The only reason I give this 4 stars is because I personally don't care for the spice they used (it is a powdered type and not hot enough for me.)  It tastes good but isn't my favorite.  If you aren't into inferno heat out of your food give this a try as you may just like it a lot!

review/summary: Not so great
review/text: I like beef jerky and I have tried many different brands so far.  Some were good and some were bad.  Heck, I even tried ebay jerky and thought it was okay.  This jerky would be the first jerky I would rate below average.  I even thought Golden Valley natural was acceptalble which is rated at 2 stars.  Smalls like jerky, looks like jerky and it is all natural beef jerky without msg/nitrate.  So what could be the problem? Texture.  I have pretty weak teeth so I prefer softer jerky. This jerky however went beyond that.  This jerky ALMOST litterally melts in your mouth.  When I chew on it, it crumbles and I am left with beef powder in my mouth.  If you are a denture wearer, this jerky might be a good option since it is very easy on your teeth.  I am not at that stage yet so I want something to chew on!  Perhaps it is because jerky was TOO fresh out of the factory and I need to let it age (dry) for some texture?  Also some strange reason, this jerky tastes really salty while having not that much salt over some other brands.  I honestly don't know how I am going to finish 6 packs...  Try 1 bag before ordering a half dozen bags.

review/text: I probably like the Cowboy Strips more from Wild Ride Beef Jerky but will admit that the natural taste is a good taste and you can tell that this contains less sodium so the taste isn't as strong as normal jerky.

review/summary: definitely not premium jerky
review/text: I had high hopes for this product, but I was seriously disappointed. I was expecting good quality beef jerky, but it is definitely not.<br /><br />The good: it's not tough like leather - it's actually pretty moist and unlikely to go stale once you open it because of the individually wrapped packages. It's also sold at a good price.<br /><br />The bad: I could detect basically no taste of black pepper at all, which was supposed to be the main flavor. Instead, it has a strange taste I can't put my finger on -- more chemical than natural. I've had plenty of black pepper-flavored jerky, and none of them tasted like this.<br /><br />Unless you're on a serious budget, I would avoid this product. Perhaps the other varieties taste better, but I'm not willing to risk it.

It is definitely an acquired taste, but once you get used to it, it isn't so bad.  It'll take care of your jerky craving.  Once warning of note, the bag will mold after you open it, so make sure you finish it off pretty quickly.  I realized the bag of mold only after I took a bite.  Didn't kill me, so now I have an immunity to something out there, just not sure what.

review/summary: Awesome taste!
review/text: I love this stuff! Wild Ride has NO nitrites and NO MSG. It is made with natural ingredients, about as healthy as you can get while still eating beef. It is also low in calories. An entire 4-ounce bag is only 200 calories, or 50 calories per serving, high in protein and low in fat. I'm watching my weight, and Wild Ride is a welcome addition to my balanced diet.<br /><br />Essentially, it is sliced steak in a bag. An average piece is bite-size, about one inch square and about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind that Wild Ride is definitely NOT shoe-leather-tough like most jerky products, thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat. If you're looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire, then buy something else. But if you want beef jerky that is chewy, tender, and flavorful, get this product.<br /><br />I have only one complaint; about 1 in 5 bags have a few pieces containing gristle or sinew (the pieces don't break down completely when you chew them). While this is an inconvenience, the problem is still minor enough for me to give the product five stars based on overall taste and quality.<br /><br />Jumpin' Hot & Spicy is zesty but not so spicy as to be unpleasantly hot. I would rate it as mild to moderately hot. It is one of my favorite flavors. MMmmmm! Yummy!

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:51 Mins<br /><br /></span>Hi,<br /><br />I was originally very excited to see a coconut drink about more inexpensive than some of the 100% Juice Brands, such as Zico, VitaCoco, Amy&Brian, One, or Naked.  My wife loves Coconut Juice, and we had been buying Zico liter's from Trader Joe's for $3.75 each.  This is the best deal available anywhere that I have found.<br /><br />Well, as someone who values my dollar, as soon as I saw the pricing on these I rushed to purchase it.  There was no picture of the can with the nutrition facts or any mention of it being only 75% juice.  Well, that's what you'll get if you purchase this.  It is an inferior product in terms of juice quality compared with any of the 100% juice brands.  They've added 13 grams of sugar (I used calculations based off how much sugar a 16.9 FL OZ can would have it was 100% juice), and they've also added something called Sodium Metabisulfite and of course they've watered it down with water.<br /><br />They cleverly call this Coconut Drink versus Coconut Juice because this is not Coconut Juice.<br /><br />All the Best,<br />Geoff<br /><br />PS, The reason why I give this 1 star is because they don't disclose on the product page that it is 25% water, sugar, and sodium metabisulfite.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: The price + being organic is what drew me in to try the Stash brand... but the taste is nowhere near the Jasmine tea that I can get at my local teashop.<br /><br />I have tried several different ways of brewing, and the sweet jasmine aroma & taste is barely discernible.<br /><br />It is drinkable though, and like I said, the price was very good.  I hope to try the Numi brand next -- I have heard rave reviews about their Jasmine Pearl teas!

review/summary: Not really an Earl Grey tea
review/text: This tea is spiced with other spices than bergamont and while the tea seems of good quality its taste it unlike an Earl Grey.  It tastes almost sweet and more like an herbal than a black tea.  If you are looking for an Earl Grey, this certainly is not it.

review/summary: Very strong...
review/text: This is my first bag of chai tea and I have to say, it's extremely strong if you try to drink this straight. I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.

review/summary: Bitter Grass Clippings
review/text: I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea "leaves" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/summary: Daughter's first choice
review/text: My adult daughter is "into" saving the planet, tigers, water resources, trees, etc. She chose this chai tea after discovering an old tea infuser in the kitchen drawer thinking it would be grand to make tea "the old fashioned way".  She realized with the first brewed cup that loose tea has a much fresher, intense flavor than teas in a bag. I doubt that she will go back to using tea bags again and will probably research and request more Stash tea products in the future.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a "premium" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.

review/summary: Go for Pinhead Gunpowder instead...
review/text: Having purchased a package of this tea and one of Stash's Pinhead Gunpowder Green, I can safely say that the Gunpowder is much better tea. The "Organic Premium" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.

review/summary: Very Bergamot-y Tea!
review/text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****

review/text: I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.

It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.

review/summary: High quality, organic!, a little flat
review/text: I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.

review/text: I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.  I like a fairly strong tea and usually grate fresh frozen ginger into my tea cup for extra flavor.  I steep a generous teaspoon of the loose leaves in 8 oz. of hot water (not quite boiling).  To my delight, the Jasmine green tea is always good with or without ginger.  I can use the leaves at least twice with good results.  The mild aroma of the tea is like jasmine blossoms and the taste has a sublte sweetness.  I drink at least 24 oz. of the tea each day.  So the fact that the tea is organic is a plus. The price is competitive.  I will buy this tea again

I can brew it, put it in my travel mug, go to the gym and an hour and a half later it still tastes great!  Can't beat the value either at about $5 a bag.  If I recall correctly it is about $7 at the Stash store in Oregon.  This is the tea that got me drinking green tea!

review/text: This has become my favorite Stash tea.  I liked the Earl Grey, but the Double Bergamot Earl Grey is twice as good!  As to whether or not it tastes like 'real' Earl Grey, who's to say?  They're all a little different.  But if you like Earl Grey, this is DEFINITELY worth a try.

To those who do not regularly use loose tea, the tea bag (Teebeutel, sachet) definitely does not taste as crisp and refreshing as the comparable tea when brewed as loose tea.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice beautiful loose leaf jasmine tea. Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania.

I love this tea, but their suggestion of one teaspoon is a bit conservative for black tea you usually do one tablespoon per cup not a teaspoon, its up to preference but i love this tea and the fact that it reminds me of camping is a plus! it makes me feel good, and it tastes great too!

review/text: I am not a real connoisseur of loose teas, but I do like decent black tea with no added flavors, just loose black tea like indian or ceylon teas or maybe some blends like irish or english breakfast. This is a perfect example - relatively inexpensive but good tasting with full, rich flavor. Perfect for someone who would not settle for teabags, but is also not into exquisite expensive teas.

review/summary: Jasmine Green Tea.
review/text: Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx

review/text: I recently started drinking loose tea instead of bags. I was buying the jars from my health food store, but they are pretty expensive. I am always looking for a better deal, so when I found these on Amazon, I decided to get them. I gave one to my mom, and one to my brother. I kept one for myself and I think it is going to last me awhile. Since I don't know all that much about teas, I can't comment much on the quality but as far as I know it is good! It seems comparable to the same stuff I got in the smaller jars. Recommend :)

Other than actual English Teas from London, England, it was very difficult to find a rich and aromatic English Breakfast.<br /><br />After trying out at least 20 different varieties, including some very expensive brands, I've found this to be the perfect cuppa in the morning.

review/text: I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it.

review/summary: Bitter aftertaste
review/text: I love good teas -- and this is my second disappointment with Stash in the last few weeks.<br /><br />If you brew this as directed the tea leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.  I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!
