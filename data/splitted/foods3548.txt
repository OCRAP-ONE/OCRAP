review/summary: Avoid
review/text: The balls come smelling strongly of gasoline.  I tried washing them.  I put them through the dishwasher.  I tried rubbing cooking oil on them, then washing them.  I tried alcohol.  Nothing gets rid of it.<br /><br />I bought the balls for my cat to play with, and she won't touch 'em.  Wrinkles up her nose and walks away.<br /><br />My brother in law, who's in manufacturing, told me I didn't want the cat playing with them, because they're probably not exactly healthy toys.  I'm now trying to think of a suitably fun way to get rid of them.<br /><br />Avoid this product.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

review/summary: Nectar of the Heavens
review/text: I drink tea every day, but I do enjoy the occasional cup of coffee every once in a while. Because of that, I can justify paying premium prices for good coffee. Let me tell you, this coffee is worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />I had actually purchased the coffee without realizing that the beans were whole-bean. I quickly purchased a grinder. The grinder came four days after the coffee did. If I had known how good this coffee was beforehand, those four days would have been torture.<br /><br />Mind you, I'm basing this review on the fact that I have only brewed one pot so far, but one pot was all it took. This coffee is amazingly silky smooth and doesn't leave a harsh aftertaste like other coffees. It's a little on the light side, so if you like your coffee strong, I'd recommend about 1.5-2 rounded tablespoons per cup.<br /><br />I am definitely a believer in Kona Coffee now. I will be buying more of this in the future for myself and as gifts, though I'll probably use it before I have a chance to give it out.

review/summary: As good as advertised
review/text: I have to admit that initially I wrote a 4-star review and indicated that although I thought Kona coffee was good I didn't think it was any better then my favorite coffee, which is Peet's coffee. I guess I had to live with the coffee for a day or two or maybe I just wasn't in the mood when I first brewed it, but now I love it. I think all coffee lovers are always in the hunt for "the perfect cup of coffee" and although I don't know if this is it, it's a pretty great cup of coffee. I'm not a huge coffee expert so I can't dissect the taste other then to say it's not bitter like Starbucks and doesn't give me as much acid indigestion as some other cofee does. and most importantly, it is delicious! The price is steep so this won't be my everyday coffee (that honor still goes to Peets), but this is something I will definitely splurge on at least once or twice a year.

We just went to Starbucks yesterday, and she was very disappointed :)  She said she hadn't realized it, but this Kona coffee spoiled her :)<br /><br />So anyway, at least from our point of view, it's great coffee, very smooth, and a winner.

review/summary: Kona!  Kona!  Kona!
review/text: If you have been purchasing Kona coffee and it doesn't say "100% Kona", then you're buying a blend.  After brewing, Kona has a fantastic aroma with a light body and mellow flavor.  The Medium Roast is the best style to release the subtle characteristics of 100% Kona and it makes a GREAT iced coffee.  Excellent bag design and packaging, which allows for instant re-seal to ensure continued freshness and is very attractive as a display item.  The taste... aaahhhhhh.  I drink straight black, no fillers, and the smell is intense.  It drives my co-workers crazy in the morning, even the non-coffee drinkers.  They all share the same opinion when describing and tasting my Kona, and look forward to my first morning brew.  I hope others will enjoy it as much as I do.  Grab a bag NOW.  Enjoy!

I have been buying coffee from assorted vendors on Amazon for awhile now and with the Super Saver shipping and no sales tax it's been a worthwhile experience. I just wish the roasters would all consider packaging that allows the customers to store their products as well as HI Roasters.  As for the coffee, it was very flavorful, a nice chocolate overtone. But for my tastes it fell short of some lower priced Kona blends I've had and I think it's due to the light roast. If you're into a more aromatic earthy taste w/ complex mellow undertones the Hawiian Dark Roast is among the very best.

I started mixing it w/Gevalia and Starbucks to get some taste and that way it won't be a total loss.  Maybe I got a bad batch or old coffee but I am not taking a chance on this product again.

I had planned to serve this as the perfect cap for a recent dinner party with friends, but it didn't last in my house long enough to make the dinner.  So I'm back for more.<p>Now I'm wondering if the folks at Hawaii Roasters have any openings.  I work cheap...you can pay me in these wonderful, rich coffee beans!

review/summary: Worth every cent--a special treat for yourself or a friend.
review/text: Pure Kona coffee, especially when it comes directly from the farm, is everything the coffee lover ever hoped for, absolutely as good as its description suggests it will be. The flavor is rich because farm-processed coffee never has the chance to get stale--the cherries are skinned and the beans are dried and roasted immediately after picking for maximum freshness and mellow flavor.  They don't sit around over-fermenting while waiting to be processed (which then requires dark roasting to kill the "spoiled" taste).<br /><br />Though pure 100% Kona is rare and difficult to find, this coffee is the real deal--a premier coffee which is among the costliest and most sought-after.  If you are just browsing for coffee, take a close look at the label.  For some strange reason, coffee can be legally called "Kona" if it contains just ten percent Kona beans (with 90% of the beans coming from unknown sources), and some new buyers are unaware of this.  This brand of 100% Kona will justify its price and confirm everything you ever wanted in taste. n Mary Whipple

review/text: I bought this coffee after reading the reviews.  I was disappointed.  EVERYONE seemed to think this coffee was wonderful.  I certainly would not rate it bad, but OK--not exactly what I was anticipating.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I received an e-mail from the president of Hawaiian Roasters, the company that makes this coffee.  Since I was not totally satisfied with the coffee, I was given a full refund.  While this coffee is not my favorite, I will say the company makes a great effort to satisfy the customer.  Thank you, Mr. Krant.

review/summary: Aroma and Taste That Please
review/text: I have never purchased 30 dollar coffee before so this was kind of splurge for me and I usually drink coffee that comes in 12 ounce bags at about a 5 to 7 dollar range so I wondered how much difference could it really be in quality.  I was looking for some good holiday food and I read all the reviews and decided to go ahead and try it out and to my surprise I really enjoyed it and believe me I was expecting quite a bit for 30 dollar coffee.  The 1st thing I noticed was the aroma when I 1st broke into the package and it wasn't the normal aroma I was used to when breaking into new coffee for the 1st time.  The aroma was so much better and it was so much different and pleasing in smell that I knew it was going to be a great cup of coffee.  With anticipation I ground up the beans and made my 1st pot and actually just finished it before this was wrote.  I took my time drinking this coffee and I must say I have drank a lot of coffee in my time and thought I wouldn't be able to tell a difference but I found myself looking forward to my next cup.  The taste was so fantastic and full of flavor that I really didn't expect it so I was really surprised by that.  It was that good instead of with my normal coffee its usually just routine to drink it up even though its good its just not as good as this.  If you are looking for some delicious coffee do yourself a favor pick this one up. If you are like me you might splurge every once in a while on food and even if you do it once you will find yourself missing this bag when its gone b/c I know I will.  I still have about a whole package remaining and I think I will have to break down again later to get another.  Though it is rather expensive I am very happy with this coffee.

review/summary: Kona is the best, but this isn't the best Kona
review/text: I've had several types of Kona, and this one doesn't rank anywhere near the top.<br /><br />It's not bad, by any means. Kona is my favorite coffee by far, and I'd rather have this than grocery store beans. However, I've had Koa brand and Kona Mountain, plus Kona from Seattle Coffee purchased at CostCo, and they all beat this Hawaii Roasters. They're all about the same price too, some more and some less.<br /><br />Kona tends to be subtle, but this was so subtle I'd have to call it a bit bland. Perhaps the darker roast would bring out a bit more flavor. I normally get medium roast for Kona to avoid the burnt overtones which can mask Kona flavor, but there just doesn't seem to be that much flavor here to begin with.<br /><br />I noted another review that also complained about the blandness, and it's from roughly the time I bought mine. Given some of the other glowing reviews, I wonder if I just got a substandard batch.

review/summary: Mediocre at best...
review/text: Well, I have to stay that I was very disappointed in this coffee.  I typically buy whole bean coffee from a local company, and I gotta say that I really enjoy that moment when I break the seal on the bag, and get that rich coffee aroma.  So, always hearing that Kona coffee is the best in the world, I really expected a great experience from this - however that wasn't the case.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, there was virtually no coffee aroma.  I don't know if it's been sitting in a warehouse too long (expiration date on back was July 2011 - it's April 2011 as of this writing).  The vacuum seal seemed okay - no tears in the packaging; so I'm at a loss to explain why the coffee seemed 'stale' .  And after brewing my first pot, I gotta say it isn't a great cup of coffee.  At best, it's a mediocre cup of coffee.

review/summary: Stale, Quality not Commensurate with Price Point.
review/text: Relative luxury items that charge a premium are subject to a greater degree of discrimination on the basis of commanding margin substanailly higher than that of more mid-stream, value or bang for the buck items.  If you're going to spend $30 for a 16 oz bag of Coffee, the expectation is that the quality of the product is high to exceptional.  My personal opinion, and that of several office co-horts, was that the quality of this product did not match the price point.<br /><br />Our office purchased a Techni-Vorum Moccamaster, with a copper heating element,  for ideal brewing.  Bottled Culligan water was used to make the coffee.  Under such conditions, the sweet flavor of Kona shines.  This did not happen with this product.  The consensus in the office is that the beans were stale.<br /><br />One trick in the food industry to add margin is to sell products that are slightly aged, and a at least a little bit if not moderately on the way to expiration.  This is the model that Trader Joe's operates under.  The difference is with Trader Joes, you pay less for the product, so there is still some relative value in the purchase.<br /><br />Pure Speculation:  I do wonder if this is the case with this product.  Higher Margin Product not selling in recession, gets older, passed off at disproportionately high price point.  I can not know.  What I do know is that I will not be buying this again. Again, while my experiences with Kona with other lines have been outstanding, this particular product was stale.  Suggestions on other Kona lines appreciated.  I am willing to pay up for good beans.  If paying at this price point, the expectations are high.<br /><br />Did have better Luck with Caffe Britt, which while a darker roast, exceptional quality, and good value at the price point on Amazon.  Happy brewing.

review/summary: You do not want oily beans.
review/text: I was surprised at seeing a number of reviewers saying they preferred oily-looking coffee beans. My coffee roaster and other experts have always told me that oily, shiny beans are the result of the coffee degrading and going stale. Here is some advice from [...]:<br /><br />"Shiny oily coffee being an indicator of freshness is a common misconception. Actually the oily surface outside of the roasted coffee bean is caused by a degradation of the bean when oils bleed through to the bean surface. This is caused by a dark roasting process or age of the bean. These coffee bean oils actually retain the complex aromas and flavors of the bean. If the oils are allowed to escape out of the bean the coffee will become bland tasting with a strong stale odor and it happens rather quickly.<br />Customers sometimes get confused when looking at a coffee bean and believe that if the oils are not visible on the outside of the bean that it is old and dried out which is not the case.<br />It gets worse. After a period of time, these coffee oils will then coagulate on the outside of the bean and in the bag or container where it is stored to give the coffee a more pronounced stale and  bitter flavor."<br /><br />Essentially, the cells of the bean are breaking down and releasing the oils which contain the flavor before you have a chance to extract them with your coffee maker. I admit I have had some dark roasts that were oily when I opened the bag, yet still tasted OK, but overall, oily, shiny beans means coffee either roasted a long time ago, or stored improperly.<br />I have not tried this coffee but needed to give a rating to publish this information.

review/text: I'm a pretty big coffee drinker, but had never tried Kona coffee before. I gotta say, Hawaii Roasters Kona Coffee was the best coffee I ever had. The type of coffee you want to savor for the flavor rather than gulp down for the caffeine (which is really hard to do because it tastes so good, after your first sip you just want to keep downing it rather than savor it). I purchased my first package right before the holidays and it was a total hit with my family and friends. I am now totally hooked and strongly recommend Hawaii Roasters Kona to all coffee lovers.

In fact I thought it was some of the best coffee I had ever had.  I even added some to my regular grinds and found that the improvement was very noticeable and it extended the supply.  I tried the medium roast to compare, but was disappointed.  The medium roast did not provide the same rich flavor, it was barely better than my regular at 3 times the cost. I'm going back to the dark next time.

review/text: I lived in Hawaii (island of Oahu) for 6 years and drank Kona coffee every day. Now back on the mainland, I have been purchasing Kona blends. Having grown tired of these blends, I decided to try this coffee, based mostly on the reviews. It's not even close to classic Kona. The beans seemed dry, did not have much aroma, and it took about 50% more beans per cup to make it as strong as an average cup of coffee. There was definitely some Kona characteristics to the flavor, but barely as much as you would find in a good Kona blend. I can only guess that the bag of beans that I received had been in storage for a long time or simply not stored properly. Whatever the case, I would not buy this again.

review/text: About ten years ago, I bought an amazing roast of Hawaiian Kona at Trader Joe's.  It was the, without a doubt, the best coffee I've ever tasted.  It was a bit on the pricey side and way out of my budget back then.  Recently (and I'm not sure why), I started remembering what an amazing roast that was so I went to Trader Joe's to splurge.  Much to my dismay, they were out of it.<br /><br />I went online and did some research to find premier 100% pure Kona beans and ended up buying this one by Hawaii Roasters due to its positive reviews on Amazon.  I was super excited to get this and ended up being incredibly disappointed.  For almost $30 I expected something better but this was no more superior than the "Kona blend" I bought at Raley's for $10.<br /><br />It wasn't bad coffee but it wasn't great either.  Mediocre and incredibly overpriced.

review/text: Rating the Hawaii Roasters 100% Kona is a bit tricky - in a way it is like rating the acceleration of a Corvette or the comfort of Mercedes - it is supposes to be among the best!. So with that - if this coffee was the same price as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JZEGA">Folgers Coffee Ground Classic Roast Regular, 11.3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4BOHK">Maxwell House French Roast (Medium Dark) Ground Coffee, 33-Ounce Jugs (Pack of 2)</a> it would rate as a easy 5 star product, but it is not the cost difference is significant.  So with that it requires me to grade on a bit of a curve...<br /><br />A bit on how I prepare the coffee<br /><br />Water provided by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00407ZHSO">Filtrete 3M Filtrete Water Station</a><br />Burr Grinder <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00018RRRK">Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill (CCM-16PC1)</a> (Medium burr)<br />Coffee maker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AKKCLK">Bunn STX Specialty 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer with Thermal Carafe</a><br /><br />What I like<br /><br />- A very, very smooth coffee - absolutely no trace of bitterness.<br />- Very aromatic as you grind the beans<br />- Other reviewers compared about the beans being a bit dry - mine were fresh<br />- Nice medium roast - not overly bold (This is a personal preference)<br />- The beans were not oily (indicating over-roasting)<br /><br />Other notes<br /><br />- Not a exotic flavor - it does not offer the range of flavors of a Kenyan or other African coffees (which are usually cheaper). This is difficult to qualify, but other high-end coffees have a more distinguished flavor - the Sumatra's are a bit bolder and almost smokey, Kenyan has a semi-sweet winey/oak flavor and so on... I don't notice any of these in the Kona.<br /><br />Final Verdict - A very good coffee, but it is pricey especially when compared to some of the African countries.<br /><br />4 Stars due to the price (5+ Stars compared to generic coffees)

review/summary: Worth the price.
review/text: Made with a french press, this coffee is very smooth. Does not have a bite like sumatra or other strong coffees. However, 1 lb is not a lot, and it does run out fast. Consider making a blend with 50% kona and 50% from a local source, if you use a light roast, you get a strong caffeinated drink.

review/summary: Some of the best coffee around!
review/text: I was at first skeptical about doing my shopping for coffee online. After all I'm the kind of guy who is more apt to go into the brick & mortar store and really stick my nose into those coffee beans. I mean, really get up in there, you know what I mean?<br /><br />So when my co-worker received a package from Amazon.com with these Hawaii Roasters Kona coffee in it, I naturally gave him a hard time about it. But that was mostly because he's a Dodgers fan.<br /><br />But dear reader, let me tell you! When I brought this freshly brewed, aromatic cup of Joe up to my nose, it was like a breath of tropical Hawaiian air.<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake as me. Don't prejudge coffee just because you can't stick your nose in it first. Buy this bag... it's what, thirty bucks? Give me a break. It'll last you at least a month! Or you can just waste it on five tall cups of some fancy schmancy, bitter Starbucks brew. The best part? You won't have to deal with any of those hipster baristas who think they're JUST SO COOL.

review/text: I am a dark roast coffee drinker and was skeptical when I got this bag of medium roast beans as a gift. What a wonderful surprise to find this is a full flavored and very smooth coffee. Some of the dark roasts (mostly the cheap ones) tend to be bitter and for me, most of the medium roasts taste weak and bland. This Kona coffee is a balance of flavor and richness and oh so smooth.  I am ordering my second bag and am now a huge fan of Kona coffee.

review/summary: Decent coffee, but simply did not smell or taste like Kona
review/text: The package had a "use by" date of July 2, 2011, which means a roast date of over a year ago. By comparison, the Lavazza beans which arrived the same day had a use-by date of 6-15-12. While it may simply be a freshness issue, it tasted like the many knock-off "kona's" you find at Sam's Club or BJ's, and not worth the price. Would not recommend.

review/text: I bought five pounds of this coffee for Christmas presents based on its awesome reviews and an incredible sale at the time.  I kept one bag for myself as I am also a coffee fanatic and I was horrified by its poor quality.  The beans were very light and EXTREMELY DRY - there was absolutely no "oil" on the beans at all. Tried to alter the amount of coffee I used with each new brew in an attempt to improve the taste but remained bitter. I am so embarrassed that I gave this coffee as gifts - my friends probably think I got it for $5 a pound! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!<br />However I must say that seller itself was good and beans were shipped via priority mail directly from Hawaii.

review/text: I have tried lots of different coffee brands this year, and this one, by far, is the best. Although I usually prefer a light roast, this medium roast is fantastic. There's nothing like Hawaiian Kona. The price is still reasonable for Kona beans, and this brand really is exceptional.<br /><br />I drink it black, so it has to be good. There's no attempt to hide the flavor of crappy beans by over-roasting. Or, even worse, adding "flavorings" to mask an inferior product.<br /><br />This coffee is very fine quality. Recommended.

review/summary: Not a good purchase
review/text: This was not a good purchase for me. I'm a coffee fanatic and was hopeful of a great coffee experience. Over half the bag went into the trash. I NEED GOOD coffee, especially my first cup of the day. If I don't have that good coffee experience, I trash the offending beans and move on until the beans I find give me what I'm looking for. I found no aroma or flavor with the coffee brewed from these beans. I went back to my regular provider for my beans. (they don't carry Kona which is why I was intrigued to try this offering) I've had 100% Kona many years ago and LOVED it, so it's not that I'm unfamiliar as to what I should be tasting. It's just that this brand did NOT "knock my socks off" and I was hopeful that it would.<br /><br />UPDATE: After my review, the President of Hawaii Coffee Roasters contacted me and offered a refund or a new bag. I left the choice up to him. I received a new bag and have to say that I had the 5-star experience that I had hoped for. I ended up having received a "bad bag" the first time around. While it is not my favorite varietal, it certainly gave me the coffee experience I was looking for with great richness, smoothness and flavor. I also give 5-stars to Hawaii Coffee Roasters and its' President for OUTSTANDING service.

review/summary: What a disappointment
review/text: For reference, I've had several Kona coffees before and loved them all.  I had high expectations for this coffee after reading the reviews and then after smelling the beans.  The smell of the beans is the only good thing about this coffee though.  I was skeptical when I saw how very dry the beans were as if they'd been sitting on a shelf for quite a while.  I decided to go ahead and make a pot of french pressed coffee regardless.  Based on how bad it was (couldn't even finish the cup), I'm guessing that everyone giving this good reviews must be dripping this coffee.  Still, I can't imagine that it's very good either way and I have to wonder what kind of coffee is normally drunk by the people who rated this as good.  This is nothing like any of the Kona coffees I've had in the past.  It's not even close to being on par with the Sumatra I've been drinking lately.  If you normally drink pretty good coffee, especially if you grind your own beans that have a nice oily appearance, I'd recommend avoiding this one.  I'll probably be throwing the rest of mine out.

review/summary: Tastes like Hawai'i in the morning
review/text: I really look forward to Saturday mornings when I brew up a pot of great coffee and have time to sit and savor it. Weekdays what with getting the kids going we use Major Dickenson's from Peet's, but the weekends are different.<br /><br />Having family in Hawai'i we have learned about the pitfalls of buying "Kona" on the mainland (heck even on Ohau). We have bought Kona "blends" that tasted like old Folgers. We have bought stale coffee that should have been tossed. We have bought over roasted beans that were little better than Starbucks French Roast.<br /><br />We have also bought Cromwell Estate peaberry (roasat to order and simply amazing) and until recently, we found that the best bang for the buck was the Costco Kona which you can only get on-island.<br /><br />When we ran out of the last batch of the Costco Kona, we took a gamble on this one and are really happy.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Medium roast is a real medium roast is highly consistent (leading to a MUCH better cup)<br />- The coffee is truly fresh<br />- The bean size is really consistent and there are no slubs (again leading to a beter cup)<br />- The coffee has a complex flavor that develops over time with a lot of interesting secondary and tertiary flavors<br />- Quality bag-to-bag is excellent<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- If you like French Roast, this is NOT the coffee for you. French roasting burns out a lot of the flavinoids so you are better off with Starbucks of even Safeway.<br />- at $30 a bag, it is not cheap and I really would like ot drink it every day.<br /><br />If you want a treat, give this a try.

Another reviewer wishes they hadn't tried it and I am kinda with you, I am ordering my second 5lB set. I will be looking for this place when we visit Hawaii again next year.<br /><br />I am perplexed by some of the comments from lack of flavor to burnt to oily to dry to no aroma. I am a rookie coffee snob and I just have a hard time screwing up the brew of this stuff and my only 2 methods are auto-drip and a press. I should get the next order before I am out of my last bag and I am going to do a consistency comparison to see if the roast or quality varies. I will be hard pressed to believe that would be the case though.  Age can matter and that is the only thing I can imagine that would harm this stuff.<br /><br />I'm hooked.

review/summary: Delicious but a little pricey
review/text: Love the coffee. Mild flavor. I felt "clean" drinking this compare to the Starbucks brand. Took off one star because it's quite pricey. But would recommend to anyone if they haven't tried it.

review/text: I'm not a coffee conniseur but these beans taste good.  Not too strong or bitter.  This is the only bean I've ordered on a regular basis.

review/summary: Medium to Mild Breakfast blend.
review/text: This is a good mild to medium morning coffee. We offer this as an option in the office, along w/Peet's dark roast, and Kreugers flavored single serve. The short of it is that if they don't like it, they don't drink, and this pot is always empty. I'd compare it to Starbucks and Peets mild+ blends. The order was recieved (as I recall) promptly, and the expiration date on the vacuum sealed pkg was 78 days out from receipt date.

review/summary: Good Coffee but expensive
review/text: This is the first time I splurged on full Kona coffee.  I have been curious on how good this coffee would be.  It is very good coffee but this will be he last time I buy it.  For the cost, it is not worth it.  Amazon sells some great coffee for half the price of this one.  If you have unlimited cash flow than go for it as it is good and very smooth.

review/summary: Great tasting coffee
review/text: Like most coffee drinkers, I know Kona is a special coffee bean, and this brand offers great taste. At my local coffee shop, I often pick Kona when it is offered as the flavor of the day. While the coffee shop Kona is better than an average coffee, it did not seem to be anything special, and I could guess they do not sell true Kona, but a blend.  So I decided to try a true 100% Kona and picked Hawaiian Roasters.  I am very happy with this purchase---might be the best coffee I have ever had.  The flavor is strong and there is no after-taste issue.  I picked the medium roast and I plan to try the dark roast next.

review/summary: Kona coffee
review/text: The coffee did not arrive by the expected ship date and it was supposed to be a Christmas present for my<br />husband so I was disappointed.  I do not drink coffee but he says that it is good to excellent and very smooth.

review/summary: Smooth, flavorful, and pricey
review/text: Treated ourselves for Christmas to see what everyone raves about Kona coffee.  Bought whole medium roast beans and milled just before brewing to discover the java to be nicely smooth, flavorful and enjoyable.  The price, however, doesn't quite justify the marginally-better product.  We probably won't buy this again - maybe try Blue Mountain Jamaican java next time !?
