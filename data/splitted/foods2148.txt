review/summary: If you like Peet's coffee
review/text: I'm new to Keurig and formerly a Peet's addict.  I like a very strong dark roast with a thick mouthy feel. I hate watery coffee.<br />So I started with all the extra bolds....having tried Newman's, Timothy's Sumatra bold, Black Tiger, Midnight Madness as<br />well as Emeril's.  So far, Emeril's is my first choice. Best aroma, which definitely sets off the taste buds. Strong full mouth<br />feel, with a bite on the back end. Not french roast bitter, though.  I'm still hoping Peet's will make some k cups but until<br />they do (when I don't want to use my k cup), Emeril's will be my choice.  Surprised because I did not expect this from a<br />coffee with Emeril's name on it.  I run an 8 ounce in my b30 and it's a solid morning drink.

review/text: I was skeptical to buy this coffee for no other reason than it had Emeril's name on it and he has nothing to do with coffee. However, I was pleasantly surprised for the flavor of this coffee. Keurig coffee's tend to be on the weaker side, especially if you want to brew a larger cup, but this coffee is bold and tasty. Your friends and family won't mistake it for Starbucks but it's a great cup of coffee in the morning. Don't let Emeril prevent you from trying this brand!

review/summary: Good strong coffee
review/text: I have a Keurig and use the Emeril cups for my morning has-to-be-strong coffee.  I know many people feel that the other K-cups taste a bit watered down, but these do not!  I often drink my morning cup on the smallest brew size and then work my way up to bigger cups throughout the day as I need less caffeine.  Also, the Emeril's are great with the travel mug setting because they are strong enough that even with all that water it still taste's good.  I use a lot of creamer/splenda though so my taste buds are slightly biased.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the shipping and delivery of this from Amazon took way longer than I expected.  If you need coffee fast - this may not be the way to go, but if you can plan in advance the prices are worth it to order at Amazon (though the absolute best deal is a box of 80 K Cups at BJs).

review/summary: As only Emeril can do!
review/text: This coffee is as big and bold as Emeril himself.<br /><br />One of my personal favorites of all time with the Keurig, it makes a fantastic full bodied cup of coffee without the typical burnt or overly bitter taste normally associated with dark roasted coffees.<br /><br />When brewed an immediate wonderful coffee aroma will fill your kitchen and it develops a very light caramel colored froth that hugs the edge of your cup or mug.<br /><br />A major pick me up, Big Easy Bold holds up to the largest brew sizes and makes a delicious full flavor cup for travel mugs where ordinary K-cup coffees normally become watered down.<br /><br />Brew a small size, top with the froth of scalded milk and you will have the best cappuccino replica you ever tasted at home.<br /><br />Big Easy Bold is best to sit for a brief moment after brewing before adding sugar or another sweetener as the initial "bite" of the coffee quickly mellows into deep rich flavors. I found myself at first adding too much sugar and finding the coffee a tad too sweet a minute later as the flavors settled into one great cup of coffee.<br /><br />If you love rich, full bodied cups of coffee you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />If breakfast blends and watery medium roasts are boring you, kick your cup up a notch, give it a try and fall in love with your coffee again.

And I do like many of the bolder k-cups, such as Midnight Magic and Rainforest Espresso, but those are simply better coffees to me.  Maybe I'll give the Emeril's regular another chance, but it did not win me over the first time around.  As a side-note, I really like the Emeril's decaf--it is much more drinkable to me than the Emeril's regular.

review/summary: I like the coffee, not the new price
review/text: I've been buying this coffee via subscribe and save for a few years now. It's my husband's favorite! When my last shipment was sent (just a few days ago) , I noticed the price had gone up significantly and had I known this in advance, I would have canceled the order. I have since cancelled future shipments. I am disappointed in the extreme increase in price in comparison to other like products.I realize that coffee prices are on an upswing (again), but this was a little more than I can accept.

review/summary: One word - BITTER
review/text: Horrible coffee, terrible bitter taste and a lingering aftertaste that I can't even describe!  Tried a lot of brands of K-cups and none have ever been so bad.  It's in a class by itself.  I love strong coffee,  and I gave this brand a try.  Guess I'll try another, I'm turned off of Emeril.  No Bam, just bust!

review/summary: What's wrong with these K-cups?
review/text: My daughter got a sample of this coffee in her starter pack and raved about it so I bought a box.  The coffee tastes great but out of the five cups I've made so far, two broke open and spewed coffee grounds into my cup and made a real mess.  The one I'm drinking now.....I used a paper towel to try to remove quite a few grounds from the cup so I wouldn't have to throw out three cups of coffee.  This has never happened to me with any other K-cups.<br /><br />I'll stick with Green Mountain Double Black Diamond from now on.  It's great coffee without the mess.<br /><br />Hey Emeril, see what you can do to fix this problem.  I imagine you've lost more than one customer because of it.

review/summary: Emeril's Truck-stop Slag
review/text: Someone recently bought a Keurig to share at work and also bought a box of about 8 different coffees for it.  Most of them were pretty good.  There were decent tasting representatives spanning a nice range of roast.  Of the selection, only this one (Emeril's big easy bold) was truly unpalatable.

review/summary: A little unbalanced
review/text: I love good strong coffee. It's a combination on how it's roasted and the beans used. This coffee is just way too strong. It is unbalanced and though isn't bitter (which comes from weaker coffee) it is a tad over roasted and charred tasting. Instead of tasting toasty nuances you are stuck with a smack in the face. Though very good for that wake up coffee, it's not the coffee to have if you want to savor the rich and delicate nuances that many good coffees bring to the table.

review/summary: My new favourite for a nice bold morning brew
review/text: When using a drip coffee maker, I often slipped in an extra spoonful of grounds to make my morning coffee extra strong so that the milk would not dilute it too much.  After recently having bought a Keurig, I was a bit disappointed at the somewhat watered-down light-bodied taste of most of the K-Cups which came as a sample with it.<br /><br />So my first inclination was to browse the Amazon reviews of several varieties of K-Cup coffee and take advantage of what others who like a nice strong bold cup of coffee had learnt by trial and error - and that was a good move!  I took you all at your word, ordered a 50-pack of this coffee on Monday, had my first cup of it this morning, and decided it was worth submitting my first ever review of any Amazon product ever, both to give it a 5-star rating myself and to thank those of you who take the time & trouble to give honest reviews for the benefit of people like me.<br /><br />So for the record, on a price and quality scale this is my new favourite K-Cup coffee.  Until now, my favourite on a pure quality scale was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008C9QEVU">Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona, Dark Roast, 27-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> (excellent but very pricey!) and for a bold-yet-affordable cup was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I3I4">Green Mountain Coffee Double Black Diamond, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a> (also excellent, and less pricey, but IMO not quite as nice in flavour as Emeril's "Big Easy Bold").<br /><br />For anyone looking for a nice strong full-bodied and flavourful K-Cup coffee which won't break the bank, do try this one. If you're like me you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Nice bold K-Cup but left a weird after taste
review/text: This is a good choice for a K-Cup if you like a bold rich cup of coffee. I ordered this brand for 3-4 months because it  was the best tasting bold K-Cup I found.<br /><br />I am giving it three stars because the last few shipments were not that great. It left both me and my husband with a weird metallic taste after one cup.<br /><br />I ordered Martinson's bold K-Cups about a month ago and loved it! I probably will not buy this brand again.

review/summary: Pretty good if you don't get one with a defective seal
review/text: This coffee actually tastes pretty good for a darker roast however the number of defective K-cups with seal problems can be significant.  The issue is that the seal covering the Kcup, which gets punctured to enable the drip through, seems to continually burst open during brewing, resulting in coffee grounds in your mug and quite a mess of the machine.  My wife and I have started calling these "bursters" as it happens quite frequently with these Emeril's Kcups.  You can clearly hear it from far away when you get a burster and I think if you were to be doing something directly over the machine (such as putting dishes away in a cabinet above it) there is a possibility of getting in contact with some of the scalding hot steam from the sudden release of the pressure when the seal breaks open.  The seal bursts right at the final peak brewing time, probably at about the last 30% of the brewing process.  The result are a lot of coffee grounds in your mug and over the machine brewing area.<br /><br />I have been buying a lot of Kcups quite frequently in bulk that past few months.  I've tried many different types of Kcups and have purchased several hundred of each, I have never had this happen to any except the Emeril ones.  This is not just an isolated incident, there a significant number of defective ones in each of the 18 count boxes.  Usually if you get a box which has a burster you are going to get quite a few in there, probably around 5 at least.<br /><br />Wherever these specific Kcups are being made, there is a clearly a problem in the manufacturing processing and quality controls checks.  I've also seen a few cases where I have gotten a Kcup that has 2 seals pressed onto it thus resulting in a broken seal right out of the box.<br /><br />The coffee actually tastes pretty good, I really like darker roasts and this is one of my favorite ones however the quality control needs to be significantly improved.  If I was paying full retail for these I would be pretty annoyed, I think I've paid full retail for these once at a premium supermarket and sure enough there were a couple bursters in that box so it is not an issue with the bulk purchases or anything like that.  As I said I've bought hundreds of other brands in bulk and have had no issues yet.

review/text: I purchased this product for my husband who loves very bold coffee.  Each time we have made the coffee in our Keurig it explodes all over.  (Clearly after the third try I have now thrown the rest away) We were lucky to always be away from the coffee maker, but if you were standing there it would have burned you.  All the other types off coffee that we have used and continue to use work perfectly, so I know that the Emeril coffee was the problem.  If you have kids keep them away from the coffee maker.

review/text: We got this flavor because it was A)on sale and B)Emerils- it should be tasty, right? WRONG. I won't go on and on about how much I dislike it, and it's all personal taste, but I like strong coffee and this is strong...in the wrong way. It tastes like burnt cigarettes smell. Like cigarette butts. And its aroma matches, making this non-smoker's house smell like a lounge. It is thick as tar and even if diluted with water, still retains a burnt ash taste that coats the inside of my mouth. We have had a 12 pack for over 6 months...the last two are going in the garbage, like tossing away a dollar bill. I'll stick to Dark Magic for a nice strong coffee. But, if you like that smokey flavor, this may be good for you. I personally feel like I licked an ashtray and have to brush my teeth after every sip. Blech!...maybe I did go on and on about how much I didn't like it. Oh well, don't say I didn't warn you!

They never error in favor of the customer. The coffee is just tossed in a big box loose and probably don't think anyone  will take time to count.

review/summary: Excellent, Strong Keurig Coffee!
review/text: I've not been a fan of the Keurig coffee, due to the weak nature of the brew.  "Strong" setting just doesn't get it.  I've tried several flavors that claim to be strong (Jet Fuel, Black Tiger, etc.), and by far this is the most full-bodied, strongest brew I've had.  Buying this by the gross, now!

Cost has definitely increased since my first purchase of this coffee but coffee everywhere has gone up significantly.

review/summary: Lousy quality control for k-cups
review/text: The coffee is not bad, but the production quality is hopeless.  The seal that holds the cup lids to the plastic cup consistently fails, spewing hot water and coffee grounds all over the place.  I've written to the Canadian distributor (Timothy's Canada -- [...]), but to date they haven't even bothered to say "sorry" or even "tough luck".  Summary: the coffee isn't worth the hassle, as there are all kinds of other decaf k-cup products out there that taste as good, if not better. And it is disheartening in the extreme to have to deal with a supplier that cares so little about their customers.

review/summary: How Could You Be So Bold
review/text: After FINALLY purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a "to each his or her own" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the "Midnight Magic" brand; I've tried the "Jet Fuel" brand; I've tried the "Donut Shop" brand; I've tried all of the "Extra Bolds"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!

review/summary: This is good, but it's far from the best.
review/text: Don't mean to be the one who rains on the bandwagon (pardon the metaphor crash), but, while it is definitely true what other reviewers have written -- that the coffee is very strong, very thick, and very dark (add in an acid level commensurate with the sludge-factor) -- I don't find the taste all that strong, and taste is important.<br /><br />True, these K-Cups will provide a pleasant-tasting beverage the consistency and color of Louisiana mud, but for taste, one can do a lot better.<br /><br />Just for kicks, I had K-cups of coffee back-to-back today, one of this type and one of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1CC02">Keurig K-Cup "Mini-Brewers" Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold</a>, which is, unfortunately, sold out at the moment.  True, Newman's (RIP) is hardly as dark a roast or as thick a beverage, but the flavor punches through very robustly and is totally superior in the area that counts the most to me -- taste.  It's a lot "Bold"er than this brand.<br /><br />One of my favorite dark roasts is the Coffee People line, even of decafs, which truly bury the "Big Easy Bold" in the taste department, too, even if one drinks the decaf.  Diedrich coffees come to mind as well as clear winners.<br /><br />Maybe I'm spoiled, but I tend to use fewer of the ready-mixed K-Cups brand coffees than employing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and selecting my own brand and grind.  My current favorite brand of coffee comes from a pair of small roasting houses in Washington state and Alaska.  I keep a couple days' worth ground and ready to put into the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>s, and there are few pre-packed ground K-Cups that can come anywhere close to the richness of the flavors and choices available if one "rolls one's own."<br /><br />I've got nothing against Emeril's, and it's a far superior cup of coffee to anything you'll get in most restaurants.  But, happily, we can best that effort without trying too hard.

review/summary: Best K-cup there is!!!
review/text: I have tried many varieties of k-cups and this one is by far my favorite.  Having said that, this cup of coffee is not for the faint of heart.  This is the strongest, boldest cup of coffee I have found.  It has almost a burnt flavor that I adore!  When this coffee is brewing the aroma is just about Heaven!!  If you prefer a more mellow blend I don't think you will like Big Easy too much, but personally I don't like the flavored cups which taste diluted to me.  You know you are drinking a strong, flavorful cup of coffee when you pop this in your machine.  It will stand up to cream, and is the perfect wake up beverage.  I love Coffee People French Roast, and Timothy's Rainforest Espresso, but I have to say they now taste almost ordinary to me after having discovered Big Easy Bold.  If you are looking for the boldest, most THERE cup of coffee you have ever prepared, you will not be disappointed,  Emeril Rules!!!!!

I make a traveler cup every morning and it takes (2) mediums on the B-60 brewer to fill it just right.  If you plan to make just one medium or large cup it will be just as advertised, "Extra Bold".  Great coffee.

review/summary: Makes a Great Latte - Here's How
review/text: I am a Latte fan - Starbucks has been by favorite for years.  Lately I've been tired of spending $4 a cup and having to drive to my local shop to get my morning fix so I started to venture into making them with my K-Cups.  I've tried out a few different brands and have found that this Big Easy Bold is great.  It is strong enough to keep a good flavor after adding my milk and flavorings.<br /><br />Here is how I do it:<br /><br />1 K-Cup - Emeril's Big Easy Bold<br />3 ounces of milk<br />1 tablespoon of cream<br />1 teaspoon  of sugar<br />optional: flavoring of your choice (cinnamon, caramel, chocolate, syrup etc.)<br /><br />In a microwaveable cup (at least 8 ounces)- warm the milk and cream for 30-45 seconds in the microwave on high.  In a large mug brew the K-Cup on the espresso setting.  Take a battery operated milk frother  like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KZUNK">Aerolatte Milk Frother, Satin Finish</a> and spin the milk until it is to your liking.  Add the teaspoon of sugar to the milk mixture when you have it almost finished.  Pour the milk into the mug with the coffee - stir just a tiny bit and you are ready to enjoy.<br /><br />If you choose to add the optional flavoring add it to the coffee before combining it with the milk.<br /><br />Enjoy - you will be surprised that it is actually better than you have had in the store.

review/summary: good, strong cup of coffee
review/text: I did a review in Feb. 2012 on a different size box of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, so I'm just cutting and pasting for this size box, because the product ordered was the same.<br /><br />First, let me say, I do not consider myself to be a coffee connoisseur or snob. I do not have a refined pallet. But, I do enjoy a good strong cup of coffee. The Emerils bold is exactly what I was looking for. I know there are always those out there that say, "nowhere close to my custom grind and French press." But, I use the keurig for the convenience and variety. The emerils bold is perfect for what I want - a good strong cup of coffee to start off my work day.<br />***********<br />Update 7/26/12<br />I've tried a couple other "bold" coffee's, just to compare. (Brooklyn Beanery Fugettaboutit and Jet Fuel) Not all bolds are the same. The other bolds seemed more bitter. (Some people think that bitter = strong coffee. Not true, strong coffee = good coffee, bitter coffee = bad coffee.) I'm done experimenting with different brands. For a good, strong cup of coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold will be my go to coffee from now on.<br /><br />Also, I just want to make one more comment on defective K-Cups. I see alot of reviews for both Emeril's and other K-Cups saying saying that they are horrible because 1 in every 3 explode in their Keurig machine. My wife and I go through 60 - 70 K-Cups per month, since December 2011. We've never had a problem with any of them. (when I say 60 - 70, they're not all Emeril's bold - we would be bouncing off the walls. We also use Caribou breakfast blend, decaf, green tea, heral tea, and hot cocoa.)

review/summary: Favorite keurig coffee
review/text: I've had my keurig for 4 years and it has been a love-hate relationship. I love the convenience and freshness of a single cup brewed quickly and effortlessly before my eyes but hate the weak, watery excuse for coffee that most kcups produce. Thankfully, I found Emeril's Big Easy Bold fairly early on or else my keurig would have landed in a garage sale. It is my favorite kcup. It has a strong coffee flavor with just the right amount of tang and bite that I enjoy. I do not like an ultra smooth cup of coffee any more than I do I weak one. Granted, Emeril's is not a perfect cup by any means and it does not replace the fresh ground, fresh brewed coffee I make when I have time on the weekends. However, it is an excellent compromise cup when I am rushing to get ready for work on weekdays.<br /><br />My only complaint is the new packaging Amazon has gone to with some of the kcups. They used to ship 2 of the original 24 count boxes that have the dispenser cut outs. Now they throw the kcups loose in a big cardboard box. Where I used to be able to stack and store the individual boxes in the cupboard, now I have to find a container large enough to hold 50 loose kcups without squashing them or having to pick them up off they floor when the tumbling out of the cabinet. Space is at a premium in my tiny apartment, and since I do use a few flavored kcups in a 1:1 ratio mix with Emeril's from time to time, I really miss the convenience of the small, stackable boxes.

French Roast was okay, it finishes a little bitter but I became used to that after a while.

So it has become my 'go to' coffee (at least as long as it stays on subscribe and save). I am usually not a fan of celebrity named/endorsed products as they rarely live up to expectations; however Big Easy Bold does.<br /><br />I am not a coffee expert; but I know what I like and I like Big Easy Bold.

review/text: I tried Emeril's Big Easy Bold after purchasing a Keurig which came with a variety pack of K-cups.  I have to disagree on the great reviews of this coffee.  Honestly, it tastes like bottom of the pot, truck stop coffee that has been sitting for 4+hours.  It IS thick and strong (and exceedingly bitter).  If you like a smooth, full flavored coffee this one is not for you.  In the variety pack, Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend was one of the best.  Neuman's Own Dark was good too.

review/summary: Actually Bold Coffee
review/text: I can't say that Emeril has sponsored a product I like until now. For a K-Cup this coffee is actually close to the flavor that I like in rich freshly ground coffee. I like my coffee strong, and this one delivers where most other "Strong" or "Bold" cups have failed in my opinion. I am only giving it 4 stars, because even though it is the bold K-cup I have tried, I still left wanting bolder. Until that time, when I have time, I will just use fresh ground coffee in my cheap coffee maker. For the everyday brew this product helps me power through.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Actually lives up the the Bold name<br />+Boldest K-cup I have found<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Still not near ground coffees boldness<br /><br />Overall, it is a great product. If you have a stronger K-cup you are currently using in rotation I recommend trying this one. It cost about the same so risk it for a new flavor.
