review/text: I thought I was buying this in lbs, not ounces.  It is a very small bag and very expensive!  Too expensive to make this my cats dry food choice.  The cats liked it okay, but they weren't in love with it, so I didn't purchase again.

review/summary: Our favorite beverage
review/text: I am so glad that Amazon is carrying this item.  Our local stores stopped carrying this.  It has been an item that always sold out as fast as it came in - that should have told the stores something, but they reacted by removing the label from the shelves and choosing not to carry it at all.  Great business sense, right?  This has been our favorite tea for years and we have never found anything that comes close to this satisfying.  We drink tea nearly every evening and truly look forward to this smooth, wonderful tea with the peach aroma.  I highly recommend it to even the most discerning tea drinker - but please don't buy it until we have stocked up!  By the way, this is a true deal, at least here in Alaska, as we had a best sale price of about $3.50 or $3.75 for one box of 18 or 20.

review/summary: Good Earth Black Tea, Tropical Peach
review/text: This tea makes the best iced tea: clear, crisp and satisfying and the peach flavor is not "perfumey". I've tried at least 20 different black teas and this one when brewed with filtered water stays clear when refrigerated. This is a tea to sit back and enjoy.

review/text: I mainline unsweetened iced tea and have a big pitcher made with this tea every day.  I've tried various others and they just don't come close.<br /><br />This flavor of Good Earth mysteriously disappeared form the local markets so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  With the autoship feature, it's cheaper than I was paying before and I always have a supply!!<br /><br />If you like tropical teas made into iced tea, this is the perfect one to try.

review/summary: A good thing that is hard to find.
review/text: The tea delivered was not in the same package as shown, but I suspect this is due to a change by the supplier that Amazon did not know about.  It is a wonderful tea consistent with the black teas that have made Good Earth great.  At least in my part of the country (the southeast) it has become impossible to buy Good Earth Black Tea in the stores.  This is a good tea.  I subscribed to keep it coming.

review/summary: Refreshing, hot or cold
review/text: I have been drinking a hot cup of this tea every week day for the last 7 years. I drink it not for caffeine (which it does contain; 1/2 the amount that is in a cup of coffee) but for the flavor. The peach highlights are sometimes subtle and sometimes a bit brighter, which means the bags don't always contain the same amount of the peach flavored bits or I've changed the amount of sweetener (if I even use any that day), but it doesn't matter because the flavor is very good.<br /><br />This is a wonderful flavored hot tea.<br /><br />It also makes a really good iced tea as well. When chilled or cold though, I find a little extra sweetener brings out more of the peach highlights than otherwise. Or at least that's my perception.<br /><br />For those wondering what the difference between buying Amazon's "frustration free" packaging version of this tea vs the "Regular" version is that this version doesn't have the plastic wrap on it. Otherwise the boxes are identical in frustration free or regular.<br /><br />I'm happy Amazon offers this and also offers the subscribe and save version, given how much of it I drink. I save money with the subscribe and save option and I don't have to hope I can find it at a local store, which can be quite challenging. One week the local stores will have it, you return a month later and it's vanished from shelves while the other flavors remain unchanged.

review/summary: For a bagged tea, very good
review/text: While I'm not generally a fan of bagged teas (vs. loose leaves), this black tea (with a *strongly* aromatic peach overtone) is very good. It has a clean, fresh taste (heavy-duty individual sealed wrappers help) and very little of the slight cardboard-y flavor that afflicts many bagged teas. It's also not extremely strong (a little milk goes a long way in this one), so it's drinkability is fairly all-purpose.

review/text: My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.

review/summary: Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

review/summary: Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/text: I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.

It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and other healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

review/text: I love this brand. If you go to their website, sign up for their newsletters. They'll send you $3.00 off coupons every couple of months or so. No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;)<br /><br />My dog loves this food. I use a spoonful in his dry food every night with some warm water to make it a little soupy for him. I like the ingredients, the way his coat looks, how he NEVER has bad breath or dog farts. Ever.

review/text: I mix a spoonful of the Wellness food topper/mixer with Wellness Core dry food for both of my dogs and they LOVE it! It's healthy AND grain free which makes me feel confident that they are getting everything they need in their diets. Both dogs eat every bit of their food at their scheduled feedings which has been super beneficial for potty training my new rescue dog. I would highly recommend Wellness to everyone! You can't go wrong with this stuff!

review/summary: Almost as good as the lamb
review/text: After reviewing the lamb product that is labeled the same way it is worth noting that this food is very good as well.  Not quite as attractive as the lamb, but still rated high on her taste test scale.  It provides a way to give some variety without upsetting her system.  Most of the Wellness canned foods are remarkable in that respect.

review/text: I have the pickiest eater in the world! He loves it.<br />Gilbert (cockapoo), also had stomach issues. I'm glad to report after a week on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato, in addition to the Core dry food, Gil's stomach problems are over.<br /><br /> This is Human Grade Food for dogs.  He gets one 6 ounce can a day and munches on core dry all day. I also cut out all processed dog treats. We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

review/summary: Looks like Pate meh  -1 star
review/text: well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)

You have to make sure you give a small amount depending on the size of your pet because it's high in calories. Sashie did not experience any problems when I switched to this new dog food. It's also a great coverup for any medications your dog might need to take.

review/summary: Good value and fast shipping
review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

review/text: I mix this soft food with my Boston Terrier's dry food, so I don't use much for each meal. Using the larger cans meant I would end up throwing half a can away.<br /><br />Wellness brand is very high quality food, and has been working very well for our dog who has a very sensitive stomach.

review/summary: Stinky but my dogs love it!
review/text: Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).  I just add a couple spoonfuls as a topper to their dry food, so one can lasts awhile.  I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand.

review/text: This is one of four or five varieties of Wellness canned food my dog has tried.  At first she seemed to like it, and she ate it well.  After a couple of packs(12 cans) she refused to eat it at all.  This was not the only flavor she was given during this time, but she knew when it was part of her meal.  I don't know what happened, but it is not on our menu any longer.

review/summary: Some of the other reviews are for a DIFFERENT flavor
review/text: If you can get one at the store first, obviously try it before ordering a 16 pack.<br /><br />This is the plain Jocalat bar and I can say I am hooked.<br /><br />We gave up processed sugar and are going the organic route on everything. And this is perfect for a chocolate fix. It's great because there is no added sugar (or sugar substitute) unless you count figs.<br /><br />If you are addicted to the fat (butter) and sugar of the majority of candy bars, this is different.<br /><br />Tastes what I remember a brownie to be like except less sweet.<br />When you get off sugar, your tastebuds change. It's worth it though. Some other people, if they are referring to this actual flavor, probably are thinking it isn't sweet enough.<br /><br />Did not care at all for the orange flavored one. Haven't tried the mint. Coffee/hot variety goes against what I'm doing health wise. I'm alright with pure chocolate though. I think this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />------<br />UPDATE: Haven't eaten these in a long time. I am finding I do better with soaked nuts. I also prefer to eat as close to 100% organic as I can.

review/text: Read the ingredients, this is not a HFCS/processed chocolate bar!  However if you like "REAL" food and are looking to have a slightly sweet snack that is completely good for you then this is it!  I gave up sugar a few months ago, and these bars have been wonderful, a way to satisfy my sweet tooth will all natural fruit-sugar sweetness...the main ingredient in ALL of them (Larabar & Jocalat) is dates, this one also has almonds and cocoa powder, do note that just because it has cocoa powder it does not mean it's sweet, this is unsweetened cocoa powder, the sweetness comes from the dates.  It's a snack you can feel good about eating.  Just make sure you are not expecting a sugary chocolate taste, or you will be disappointed! If you want a real, raw, good for your body, mind and soul snack then I highly recommend.  I also love the Apple Pie Larabar!

No ingredient has to be hidden or substituted with a word that you don't know what it means. All ingredients are proudly in plain English.

review/text: If you are a fan of Larabars like I am stick with the fruit bars. They are delicious. I ordered these without trying them and was very disappointed. They are dry and not the least bit sweet.  You do have to realize that you are not eating a candy bar, and that there is only 3-4 ingredients in most Larabars.  This works for the fruit flavors but not for this particular Larabar. I would not order them again.

I used to make something similar, but these are so much easier and convenient to have on hand. I suggest you try the various flavors before buying a whole box on Amazon. I decided to try every flavor and discovered (oddly enough) that I only like the original chocolate. It seemed like most of the other flavors were too dry or something. If you buys these expecting them to taste like a "real" candy bar, then you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a healthy treat though give them a try.

review/summary: LaraBar Jocalat Chocolate Coffee -- Excellent!
review/text: I have recently discovered LaraBars, and their whole-food sugar-free goodness. This was my first try of the Jocolat line... as has been suggested here, it's probably best to buy a single bar somewhere before buying a pack of 16 of them, and the chocolate coffee version was the only one I've found locally yet. So that was what I tried -- I love it and immediately came online to Amazon to order more.<br /><br />It's much more like a dessert than the regular LaraBars to me, almost like a brownie. I like the kick of coffee in it, and wonder if it helps with the flavor that some seem not to like. On the other hand, if you're expecting a decadent sugar-laden brownie, you will definitely be disappointed. This is a product you buy if you value whole foods and no sugar or artificial flavors. (Dates seem to be the main source of the sweet in LaraBars.) Also, if you don't like dark chocolate, this will not be for you.<br /><br />In general, I do find the texture of LaraBars takes a little getting used to. It's all those mushed up dates, which makes it very gummy, and then the contrast of the nuts. I'm past this now, but I know that some will just not like the texture.<br /><br />My only hesitation with this specific product is that I'm not entirely sure the niche this has in my diet. The regular LaraBars seem better as "food" (I eat them sometimes when I miss or am late for a meal). This seems more like "dessert".

review/summary: Different (Good!) Chocolate Flavor
review/text: I think that some of the comments that mention that it's not chocolate-y enough or just plain tastes bad might be used to a more milk-chocolate taste rather than a pure chocolate taste. Since, as far as I understand, the only sweetness in this bar comes from the dates, people might be missing the processed sugar and all the other stuff usually mixed in with chocolate.<br />I also thought at first that the bar tasted strange, but I think it was like a city person getting to the countryside and thinking that the fresh air is unbreathable. I was intrigued enough to try a second bar, which I tasted so much better than I remembered. The third was a revelation. Now I crave this flavor all the time, and find that most other chocolate desserts that I used to love taste much too sweet.

They have a very strong orange-y smell (like concentrated orange oil, orange extract, or lots of orange zest) and a zest-like flavor but again, not quite orange or chocolate. But I like them. Weird I guess but they're moist and dense and you can't beat the unctuous quality of a snack that feels naughty, fills you up, and yet is healthy and natural and actually good for you. I'm starting to really like Larabars and hope to try more flavors.

review/text: I tried a bunch of the fruity larabar flavors and thought that they were all sickeningly sweet.  Even with the coconut flavor that people seem to love, I could not finish the box.  I just got the chocolate mint jocolate bars and I love them.  I think the coco cuts the sweetness a lot.  I also like the dryer texture of these rather than the sticky texture of the fruit bars.  The same things I like about these bars the one star reviews seem to really dislike, so it seems like it is all about preference.  I don't like things that are super sweet.  I think milk chocolate is gross, and when I eat chocolate I prefer 85% coco or above.  So, maybe those things will be helpful to gauge if you will like these or not.

review/summary: Satisfy Without Being Overly Sweet
review/text: Jocalat Organic Chocolate Coffee was the first Larabar that I've ordered. Before the bars arrived at my doorstep, I was expecting a typical fruit-n-nut type of food bar that contains whole pieces of chunky nuts. So I was a little disappointed when I opened one and saw that the nuts were broken into tiny pieces instead. The bar was also shorter than I'd imagined.<br /><br />But the good thing is, the taste didn't disappoint. All the bars were not dry and hard, but instead they were moist and firm even when they were kept in the refrigerator. It would be a different texture if huge chunky nuts are used. Those who found them hard and dry probably got bars that were too close to their sell-by date. My bars had a good 10 months to go before expiring.<br /><br />What I like most is the fact that Jocalat Organic Chocolate Coffee (and later I found out it applies to other flavors of Larabar as well) these bars were not sickening sweet like other energy bars I've tasted. It's quite sad to taste a food bar prepared with good ingredients being drenched in excessive sweeteners, no matter how healthy the sweetener is touted to be. But this bar did not gross me out like other bars did, and in fact, satisfied my sweet tooth pretty well.<br /><br />Since I am a chocolate lover, especially dark ones, the smell and taste of the cocoa in the bar added to my satisfaction rating. There was also a subtle hint of coffee, but it was almost undetectable if you're not mindful enough.<br /><br />I wish the bars are bigger though. I'm in no way a large man, but I find one bar hardly makes me feel full, though it does stop my hunger pang.<br /><br />After trying this product, I've since moved on to other flavors. I found that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EO0XAE">Larabar Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut Chew, 1.8-Ounce Bars, 16-Count</a> has almost the same taste as this. The coconut shreds in it have no taste but gives a distinctive coconut texture. But since this bar isn't made of organic ingredients, the price is lower than the Jocalat series. If budget is a concern to you, then you may want to consider that bar instead.<br /><br />One tip: As with any food bars, always eat Larabar with a full glass of water. Although not as hard and dry like other bars, it can get a bit dry on the throat when you're near the end.

review/summary: Not one I would buy again
review/text: Don't know if the box of Jocalat bars I got was just not fresh or what but they were awful. Loved the Cherry and Apple Pie, Pecan was ok but these were like a dry brick.

review/summary: Check Expiration date!
review/text: Just received 3 boxes of the Chocolate Cherry Larabars, and they expire in less than two months.  I have eaten a ton of Jocalat Larabars and this batch is definitely dry and stale tasting.<br /><br />Amazon or Amazing Deals needs to make the expiration date listing more obvious. Who wants to pay for stale Larabars?

review/summary: Delicious Treat!
review/text: I LOVE Larabars.  I am a very healthy eater and I try to limit sugary desserts as much as possible.  With that said, I occasionally get a sweet tooth.  These are a GREAT alternative to a brownie or other dessert when you feel like indulging without the guilt.  All of these bars have very few ingredients and are made of mostly  fruit and nuts. I also find that just 1 bar is satisfying.<br /><br />These are a good pick if you like dark chocolate.  If you are more of a milk chocolate person you will probably still like them, however they are less sweet and creamy than milk chocolate is, more bittersweet.<br /><br />If you haven't tried these you need to.  With around 200 calories per bar or less, these bars are like having a brownie with less than half the calories.

review/summary: Bad, but Jocolate sending refund
review/text: I got a batch of really bad tasting bars and the expiration date was November 2011.  I contacted Jocalate from the Larabar website and they sent a check to replace the bad bars.  So if they taste bad, contact them and they will refund your purchase if the bars have not expired.

review/summary: not fresh
review/text: I usually enjoy this product but the box I received from amazon was not fresh, so tasted more dry than usual.  The date on box expires soon, so I can tell this is an old box/batch of bars. Very disappointed.

review/summary: I normally Love Larabars but the jocalat was gross.
review/text: I normally love Larabars. I have tried a few favors and have loved them all but there is something really off about the Jocalat bar. They were dried out and when you tried to take a bit out of the bar it crumbed. The box said they were good until Jan 2012 but they tasted old, dried out, just plan gross. I am not sure if this a bad box or if larabar company needs to redo their bar flavor.Bad product!!!

review/summary: good healthy alternative to "junk" bars
review/text: I love Larabars. These Jocalat are not my personal favorite but they are what you can get at a reasonable price through the subscription option. I just received a box dated November 2011 and checked them out since I had read that others found that batch to be stale. Mine are fine - or I am used to them stale as they taste the same as the last box. they are a bit drier than the regular Larabars.

review/text: These are amazing little bars. Filling, yummy and all natural. The chocolate mint flavor is nice though the mint is a little weak so it doesn't overpower you. The chocolate flavor is lovely too.

review/summary: Love larabar, but this is not one of my favorite flavors.
review/text: I have tried many of the different flavors of larabar and I love most of them.  Jocalat is not one of them.  It's o.k.  but not my taste. :)  I love the peanut butter cookie flavor and cinnamon roll.
