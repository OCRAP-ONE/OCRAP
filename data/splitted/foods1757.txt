review/text: The belgian dark chocolate is the best hot cocoa I've ever had so far and my 4 year daughter agrees.  She pinicky about her chocolates preferring only to eat dark chocolate and this dark choco. hot cocoa sure passed the test with her.  She prefers to drink it with just warm water instead of milk as using milk makes it taste like "milk chocolate".  I do, too!

review/summary: Taste is individual
review/text: I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate.

review/summary: Not a gourmet product
review/text: I bought a case of this stuff (Dark Chocolate) based on the positive reviews. Big mistake. This is half a step above Swiss Miss. It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target brand), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).<br /><br />Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. That's more like it.<br /><br />Stephen's chocolate has bad/very light color, little aroma, thin, doesn't dissolve. A very disappointing purchase.

After 1 cup, I threw both cans away. If you want a really great cherry hot chocolate, add 3-4 teaspoons of the cherry juice from a jar of maraschino cherries to your favorite milk hot chocolate. YUM!!! Add more if you use dark hot chocolate.

review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: This review is for their dark chocolate. Most who like dark chocolate are into the pure chocolate taste and its health effects...not the sweetness! Just as with good coffee, its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there aren't that many sweet-freak-fatties drinking it. The ancient Incas didn't use any sugar at all with their chocolate!<br /><br />I did give it an extra star just for having a dark chocolate drink product since their aren't many companies that even make one, so kudos to them for that.

review/summary: Warning: Make sure you're buying the right flavor.
review/text: I bought some of this chocolate for my mother who can't have much caffeine. She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its "food". and the company who makes it basically said "Sorry, but it sucks to be you". So here I sit, 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use.

review/summary: One of the upper tier Belgian ales on the market - 4.5 stars
review/text: With the exception of perhaps Stella Artois (which I don't honestly consider to be a true Belgian beer), Duvel is arguably the most well know Belgian beer in the States.  It's a very good golden ale; coming in at a robust 8.5% ABV, it has more of a pilsneresque translucence  than many of its brethren, but it also has a well rounded, saison style flavor sans excessive sweetness.<br />Although I do enjoy this ale, I don't purchase it very often.  My general impression is that, while it should rightfully be considered among the best Belgian (and Belgian style) ales today, there's a scintilla of quality lacking with this one that (for me anyway) keeps it just below the apex of Belgium's finest.  If I had to give Duvel a letter grade, it would probably be an A-.<br />If they ever decide to under cut their competitors by $3 or $4, that would definitely be a game changer in my decision making process for buying Belgian/ Belgian style ales.  Until then, however, I will continue to purchase Chimay, Delierum Tremens, and other apex ales the majority of the time

review/summary: Highly Recommened A Must Try
review/text: Either while conducting business or simply entertaining at my office, a cup of coffee is always extended as token of friendship or goodwill and I have yet to find anyone who does not love the Kahlua K-cup. At first, it could be perceived as politeness on their part; however, guests often follow-up with requests for a second cup at a later time or mention that they have purchased some for themselves.<br /><br />I strongly recommend giving it a try and if the taste does not suit your palate, offer a cup to your guests and exchange opinions until your supply runs out. In any manner it is put to good use.<br /><br />Please note: while the product is named "Kahlua Original," it is still coffee and does not possess the same syrupy, chocolaty, sweet taste the liquor has. Nevertheless, we have found it to be a great cup of coffee sweetened or with cream.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/text: I had gotten this coffee out of pure curiosity, and I didnt really look towards the reviews first, but did after I had purchased it.<br /><br />I first brewed this a couple days after getting it in the mail and put my normal milk and sugar in it to finally try it. The scent was nice but I could already tell that it had a pretty defining caramel punch to it. From the way it smelt that was pretty obvious. Once trying I wasnt too upset by the nice caramel taste it had, but for coffee it wasnt that defining. None the less it was good for what it was. I still dont have anything to compare it to really since i havent drank real kahlua before and I dont really like caramel.<br /><br />My husband however loved it since he is a big caramel fan. So i had to give it 4 stars.

review/summary: Nice change
review/text: You get a hint of Kahlua, not a burst of liquor flavor.  I prefer it with a little creamer and Agave sweetener.  Neither the creamer, nor the Agave, hide the tast of the coffee.  It is a nice 'change up' from 'just' coffee.

review/text: This coffee is very aromatic. The taste is ok, if you can get past the smell. It took me a couple of cups before I realized the reason I keep getting a nauseous feeling, before i even would drink it. The best way to describe it, I guess would be the aroma is too overpowering.

review/summary: By far, not your average cup of coffee.
review/text: I have tried quite a few brands and blends of k-cups. With that said, this is one of my least favorite. Although the description and label boasts the Kahlua flavor, in my opinion, it does not taste anything like Kahlua. The taste is unpleasant, similar to a freshly sweetened cup of day old coffee and leaves a terrible aftertaste that turns the stomach. I recently ran out of k-cups and had to use one of these as a last resort. After several sips, I ended up pouring the rest down the drain. Personally, I'd rather sip the broth of a used ten year old Dr. Scholl's insert than to drink this coffee. How do I rate this item?  Two thumbs down. Amazonians beware!

review/text: Because this coffee does not smell like "sewage" or "skunk".  It DOES not smell bad, nor does it taste bad.  Now, this was not to my liking as I prefer a bolder coffee.  It is a very mild, smooth, and flavorful coffee.  If you prefer a mild coffee, this might be right up your alley.  For those that said it doesn't taste like Kahlua, well, nothing but real Kahlua tastes like Kahlua! You don't get that flavor without the alcohol!  And these don't have alcohol in them.  Give it a shot...it's worth it!

review/summary: Timothy's World Coffee, Kahlua
review/text: I would say this is a medium strong coffee.  Don't get it twisted, this is NOT the "Kahlua" coffee you would get from a bar or mix at home. There is NO shot of Kahlua! You might get a slight whiff of something right after it is made and still "black" but not much else.  If you want the real deal, make a run to the liq cabinet or store and pour your own right after it is brewed.  Of course I didn't expect an alcohol content, but I sure wished for the flavor.  My wife picked up some non-alcoholic alcohol flavorings from Watkins which I use in my coffees sometimes.  I doubt I'll reorder this brand.

review/summary: Makes great ice cubes!
review/text: We like this a lot. If you like the Kahlua liquor, odds are you will like this too. The aroma is just like kahlua so if you are not familiar with the drink I can see how it's aroma can seem strange.<br />Coffee and Kahlua is one of the most popular drinks made with Kahlua We like this most as an iced beverage with Kahlua in it.<br />We have the platinum brewer that has an iced coffee brew size and we brew 2 Kahlua cups on the iced coffee size over an ice packed standard tumbler. Add creamer and 2 shots of Kahlua Liquor and you have a very tasty sweet summertime beverage. It should work with any brewer just use the smallest size your brewer has and add less ice.<br /><br />We have also made Kahlua ice cubes so the ice doesn't water down the drink as much. Just brew 2 of your largest brewer size and pour into ice cube trays and freeze. Work's great!<br /><br />As with most flavored coffees, a sweetener needs to be added to bring out the flavor. This Kahlua does not taste very good as a straight up black coffee. I use Green mountain breakfast blend or Caribou Daybreak for Black coffee.

I'm just not into flavored coffee that much.  I think the smell of the coffee, as it brews, is great... but it doesn't taste like it smells really.  Kind of a bitter aftertaste.

review/summary: Eau de Skunk
review/text: When I first pulled a Kahlua k-cup out of its box, I noticed an odd aroma. I couldn't quite place it, though. Perhaps some type of spice I didn't care for. I wondered if someone had spilled something unpleasant on my box of k-cups, because surely that smell couldn't be coming from my coffee.<br /><br />I brewed that first Kahlua k-cup, and the smell only got stronger. Uh-oh.<br /><br />I added sugar and milk and drank the resulting stinkfest. It didn't taste nearly as bad as it smelled. But that's hardly a ringing endorsement of this coffee, is it? I came to Amazon and noticed that Kahlua k-cups happened to be in my Gold Box today. Out of curiosity, I clicked on the link to read other people's reviews, and I could suddenly identify the odd stink from these k-cups: yes, it's skunk, just as other reviewers said! These k-cups, and now my entire house, smell like skunk spray.<br /><br />I'm off to throw out my remaining Kahlua k-cups, wash my hand (which smells just from handling the k-cup) and clean my Keurig brewer. Maybe some Lysol will let me keep my house, rather than having to move out. ;-)<br /><br />Needless to say, I don't recommend anyone else purchase this particular variety of k-cup, unless they enjoy skunk-scented coffee. On the other hand, it certainly will wake you up in the morning.

review/text: I wanted to try a medium roast K-cup and thought I would give Timothy's Kahlua Original a try.  I was very disappointed.  There were no earth tones, no fruity aroma, just kind of a bland, bitter, acid after-taste that was also hard on my stomach.  I normally like Expresso and dark roast coffees, which I love to savor in my mouth before I swallow.  This Kahlua had a bitter taste despite being a medium-roast coffee.  Rather than looking at the two Kahlua boxes for the next several months - I did what any thoughtful father would do - I gave one of them to my son to try.  He said he loved the Kahlua!  Different tastes for different 'buds! Now guess what he is getting for Christmas?!

review/summary: Not horrible, fairly decent taste
review/text: I concur with other reviewers regarding the skunky smell this coffee can have while brewing.  It's sort of skunky, but I also described it as burnt chocolate.  It's not overwhelming but if your standing over your Keurig while its brewing, the smell can make you take a step back.  Once it's done brewing though, the actual coffee smells just fine.  You won't walk in to work with your mug and have people think you brought in a pet skunk.<br /><br />The taste really isn't bad at all to be quite honest.  It's not a strong cup of coffee, it even says "Mild" on the box, so don't expect that.<br /><br />I think when some people say that it doesn't taste like plain coffee with Kahlua in it probably haven't actually put plain Kahlua in coffee.  They've probably put one of the flavored Kahlua products in their coffee, like hazelnut or french vanilla (which is very yummy).  Plain Kahlua is just a coffee liqueur, that kinda tastes like, well, coffee.<br /><br />I only gave three stars because of the slight inconvenience of the brewing smell and because it's just too mild for me.  My wife seems to like it more than I do, but she's not really a coffee drinker, so the mildness must appeal more to her.

review/text: Aroma- OK. I didn't find it offensive, but it didn't entice me to lean in and inhale. The taste was a nice flavored coffee, enjoyable but I wouldn't have known it was a Kahlua coffee in a blind taste test. Adding cream/milk brought out more of the warm tones of the brew. All-in-all, it is a nice coffee and I'm glad I tried it but I probably won't buy another box.

I've lost some of my sense of smell but have never felt it gave off an offensive odor. I too would like more Kahlua flavor but I think it has a good, smooth taste. I also wouldn't call it bold as others do. I think it is much more on the mild side. It's always interesting to see such diverse opinions when it comes to taste. I'm about to make my second purchase so it works for me.

review/text: The idea of a Kahlua flavored coffee was quite enticing.  I like Kahlua and even bake with it.  This coffee, while not horrible, was simply bad.  I am so sorry that I have two cartons of it.  I can't give it away fast enough, although I do warn my friends that I do not like it.

review/text: I don't find the flavor of this coffee to be offensive, but the first time I brewed it, my family all started asking, "what smells like skunk?" I had the same reaction whe I brewed a cup in my classroom--the kids came in from recess and the first one in the door complained that it smelled, "like a skunk in here." It's now the standing joke--"Who wants some skunk coffee???" Like I said, the flavor is fine; perhaps a bit on the "burnt" side, but not too dark. Doesn't taste much like Kahlua--think the name is more of a novelty. I won't buy this again, however, because brewing it is akin to lighting a skunk scented candle.

review/summary: Worst Coffee
review/text: This is by far the worst coffee we have ever had.  We have been using our Keurig machine for over two years and have tried many different coffees.  One thing we have learned is that you really have to take flavored coffees with a grain of salt as you sometimes have to search your palate for the advertised flavors.  That being said, this coffee had no Kaulua flavor but more importantly, it just tasted bad.  For what it's worth, our favorite coffee is Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee.  We just tried Donut House Cinnamon Roll and it's also very good.

review/summary: unique taste
review/text: I can see why this flavor would stir controversy.  Personally, I very much like the flavor, although I do not think it is Timothy's best flavor.  That being said, I have found that time and again, Timothy's coffees are richer and better flavored than most of the brands that I have tried (and that is many).  I have this on auto delivery and will keep receiving it.  I normally drink this coffee in the afternoon and sometimes at night.  I prefer Columbian or expresso or any other stronger coffee in the mornings.  As for smell as other reviewers have stated,  I do not find it offensive.  I even brewed a cup, went outside, came back in and smelled the kitchen.  Nope, it did not bother me, and in fact, I thought the kitchen smelled good.  (I have an exceptional keen sense of smell.  My family can attest to that).  I believe that all flavored coffee is subjective and some coffee flavors appeal to the majority and some will not.  Thanks Timothy for great coffee!

review/summary: Bold flavor, but. . .
review/text: This robust flavor stands up well to a travel-sized mug and is indeed very smooth as described, but I didn't get an actual Kahlua flavor much, if at all. At first the flavor seemed to have a burned taste to me--the very flavor I was avoiding with the single serving Keurig system.  I decided to test it by adding some real Kahlua to standard unflavored coffee and found it didn't taste vastly different--so I guess this is how it is supposed to taste, but it's not what I expected.  The guy in the liquor store said that without the alcohol you wouldn't get the exact taste.  Overall, I found the flavor okay in a big mug (too strong for me in a cup) and the two-box pack is a good value.

review/text: I was pretty excited to receive this flavor, as Kahlua is one of my favorite flavors.  Upon making the coffee, my wife walked through the kitchen and asked if a skunk has sprayed outside of the window.  The coffee gives off a VERY strong aroma when brewed.  If you like a strong cup of coffee, this one is for you.  As the earlier poster stated, I didn't get much of the Kahula flavor that I was hoping for.  Not sure if I'll even use up the cups due to the aroma that is created when brewing. Out of all of the flavors I have tried, this is probably the worst.

review/text: This is most definitely the worst K-Cup I have ever tasted.  I have had the pleasure of tasting the majority of K-Cup varieties and this by far the worst!!!!  It smells horrible and tastes even worse.  The best way to describe the odor is the burnt aroma that would come from a coffee pot that was left on a burner until all you could smell was the charred remains.  Since when does Burnt = Kahlua?  After brewing this in my office, I was trying to find lysol or air freshner to clear the air.  I feel I need to run vinegar through machine to clear any trace of this bad coffee.  I have 23 more K-Cups out of the box of 24 if anyone wants them for free.

review/summary: Puzzled by the negative reviews
review/text: Though this is my first K-Cup review, Let me establish my position and reasons I came to this conclusion. First, I am coffee wimp. I drink coffee only with half & half (fat free) and imitation sugar. Second, my B40 has not yet arrived so I used my Krups model 871 Espresso machine to brew my K-cup which, is not all that different than the brewing process of the Keurig machines. Third, I gave up drinking all drinks made up or including alcohol in 1988 due to health reasons but prior to that time I had drank White Russians and was very fond of them I just can't remember exactly what Kahlua tasted like except it was sweet and I enjoyed them. Forth, Wither one likes or dislikes one K-cup over another is purely subjective and I'm not criticizing those who wrote negative review. With that established, lets move on.<br /><br />When I opened the Kahlua K-cup I noticed a distinct sweet aroma and also a dark roasted bean odor like one might experienced from a Starbucks coffee; so being from Seattle Washington I'm use to that.<br /><br />I pealed off the lid of the K-cup and emptied it into the Krups filter basket. Tampered it down sightly like one would do for an espresso grind, measured about 8 ounces of water and poured that into the machine and then turned it on.<br /><br />When the coffee started to drip into the carafe and some steam arose I wasn't sure wither to hold my breath or hold my nose. Much to my surprise I did notice an odor like from a dark roasted bean or from my espresso's I use to make, but nothing offensive. I was a bit perplexed; again I thought of the reviewers who had complained of an offensive odor emitting from their machines during the brewing process.<br /><br />Upon completion of the brewing cycle, I poured the coffee in my large mug added the Half & Half until it reached a blond- Carmel like color (but not enough to over power the coffee) and the sweetener and took my first sip, with great anticipation. Not bad was my first impression. I actually enjoyed it. It had a sweet but not to sweet flavor and to my mind, a Carmel like flavor with a medium-dark roasted base of a regular coffee. No offensive taste or aroma others had written about and a pleasant after taste that lingered for some time after wards, not to strong nor acidic quite pleasant actually.<br /><br />My conclusion? Perhaps the other reviewers had a bad batch or this particular flavor needs to be consumed with some cream or cream like dairy product and or a sweetener. Either way, I plan to continue on drinking this K-cup flavor for some time and can't wait till tomorrow to have my next cup.<br /><br />When my B40 arrives and I have a different result with that machine I will add an update.

review/text: I am having a lot of fun with my Keurig coffee brewer. There are som many flavors of K-cups out there that it is fun trying samples of all the flavors. This is a new flavor that I wanted to try. I have found a lot of the flavored coffees do not taste all that good and only a few brands have decent flavored coffee. What I like about this Kahlua flavor from Timothy's is that the flavoring is not overpowering and lets the taste of the coffee come through. It is very pleasant to me and the wife and a good change of pace from what we normally have in the pantry. This is one flavor I will try to keep in stock.

review/text: I bought a single one of these locally to try out and thank GOD I only bought one!<br />After I hit the brew button I walked over to the fridge to get the creme and as soon as I opened the door the stench hit me. I swear I thought something was rotting in my fridge but it was actually this swill brewing on the counter. I was horrified. Some people described it as a burnt smell and it certainly has that going for it but there's so much more. It's unbelievable. The taste isn't as bad as the smell but it's so overwhelming that you just can't get past it.<br /><br />Clearly a LOT of people like this coffee and I would suggest trying one before you buy the case. You will be very angry to find out you're one of those people that thinks this smells worse than a spent diaper.

I would not recommend it, or ever purchase it again. In fact, I would never drink it if it was given to me for free. It received one star from me because I could drink it if I had to. I would advise that you taste a single K-Cup if you can, before you waste your money on a box of it. By the way...I love real Kahula in coffee. Good luck.

review/text: We have been using K=Cups for our Keurig for years now. This is the first time we have gotten a box where all the k-cups are defective. The tops apparently aren't on right because every cup gets coffee grounds in it.<br /><br />Horrible!

review/summary: Kahlua Coffee
review/text: My husband and I both enjoy this Kahlua flavored coffee.  It's not harsh or overbearing.  Just right.  Oh and by the way my husband was not a coffee drinker prior to trying this.

review/summary: Kahlua Coffee
review/text: Wonderful Aroma of Kahlua when brewed. Coffee is too weak. I like Bold Coffees like Sumatra but can't resist the flavour of the Kahlua. I make it on the espresso setting...still too weak for me. Most times I brew a cup of Sumatra and a cup of Kahlua and mix them together to get Bold & Flavourful together. I will continue to buy this product but wish that Timothy's would come out with their flavored coffees in bold in addition to their mild versions for people like me who prefer intense flavors.

review/summary: Terrible Flavor
review/text: I was shopping in my local grocery store and passed by an endcap with this coffee.  It smelled so good, and was strong in a good way.  I could smell it through the box.<br /><br />So...I ordered it here.  Much to my dismay, the coffee I thought was so great tastes terrible.  It has a burned flavor.  The beans used to make this coffee must have been over-roasted big time!  I won't be buying this flavor again.
