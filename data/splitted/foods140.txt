review/summary: not my cup of tea, so to speak
review/text: This product is great if you like the particular spices used in the mix.  Unfortunately, although I am drinking it, I am not enjoying it as the flavors just don't jive with my palate.  If you really like the spice combination (I like cinnamon, for example, in almost everything, but in the chocolate mix it just doesn't make it for me), you'll love it.  I guess my advice is the product is fine if you like the flavor combination, but I would advise trying the mix in a small packet to determine whether or not it's for you.  I have this huge quantity to consume, and I rarely partake of it as I don't really care much for it.

review/text: I really like this product. I NEED coffee in the morning, so I add this to my coffee, in addition to adding a teaspoon of ground espresso to the cup as well. This has a nice taste to it, not too too sweet & just a bit of a cinnamon-y flavor. Its very good. A little pricey, but buying it in quantity like this saves me a few trips to Whole Foods.

review/summary: Gotta' Have My Chocolate!
review/text: YUMM!! And it's Lactose, Gluten and Soy Free* (*Save Soy Lecithin/lecithinan, which it seems that many with soy allergies can tolerate)<br />Ingredients - per package (3 # bag)<br />Pure Hawaiian cane sugar, Premium Forestero cocoa, ground chocolate (sugar & Cocoa processed with alkali, unsweetened chocolate, soy lecithinan emulsifier, pure vanilla), spices, all natural flavors & salt<br />&<br />Although the tins come with the scoop (which holds about 2.5-3 T.), I get a better price buying the 3-Pound Bag and using a 2 T. coffee scoop. I found the secret to using this in a manner I can enjoy it, as I find the original instructions make it way too intense.  I only add 1 scoop (2T.) to a cup, then add enough hot water to fill the cup half full, stir, then top off with almond milk or coconut milk.  Yummm!!  And, being Diabetic, I get my daily cinnamon!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ABQ60G">MOCAFE Azteca D'oro 1519 Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate, 3-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: MOCAFE Mexican Spiced Chocolate
review/text: The MOCAFE Azteca D'oro 1519 Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate is a very interesting drink. Not knowing what to expect [I speculated that the hot chocolate would have a touch of heat], I made a cup as soon as it was delivered. To my surprise, it has a strong cinnamon [and probably nutmeg] flavor - it is a good hot chocolate.<br /><br />I mix the chocolate powder with steamed/frothed milk from my espresso maker - I find this makes the drink much better. It takes a couple of cups to really make an opinion, but I think it is a good hot chocolate to drink every day.

review/summary: The best Mexican mocha powder
review/text: We discovered a cafe that had excellent Mexican mochas about three years ago. They were expensive but we didn't visit that often. Then we discovered this was the powder used to make the mochas. It is all natural and tastes great. It is really rich and has nice spicy undertones. This is the cheapest way to purchase it in bulk.<br /><br />Now we make our mochas at home with an espresso machine and steamed milk. This also is loved by our children for hot chocolate.

review/summary: Love the cocoa, not the packaging.
review/text: I found this cocoa at Bristol Farms while looking for a healthier cocoa without the partially hydrogenated oils in most of them.  I love the spiciness of this cocoa and put half a scoop in my coffee every morning.  I don't drink straight coffee so I carry this powder with me when I travel too.<br />I was thrilled to find this item on amazon after Bristol Farms ran out for a while.  I have received a few of the 25 lb boxes with no problems, but my last $113 box is in the trash after I cut the plastic tie and found baby silverfish in it.  These bags are not sealed, just have a plastic tie aroung the bag opening so lots of tiny things can crawl in.  I know we have silverfish here at my husband's house, but now that I have just thrown $100 in the trash I wonder why they can't seal these bags?  I'm going to have to start buying a smaller quantity and just pay more per ounce so this doesn't happen again.  Unless a few people are drinking this or you only have one serving a day you need to plan for storage of this powder for quite a while.

review/summary: How about this idea?
review/text: How about this idea? Even though we buy the non-hydrogenated "natural" peanut butter (Skippy, mainly)  sometimes it is still separated so there is oil on the top. Even though you can mix that oil back into the peanut butter, when you do the results are usually a fairly runny peanut butter unless you refrigerate it. Or, you could drain the oil off, but that's such a waste. So, we like to mix in some of this powdered peanut butter to thicken those runny non-hydrogenated peanut butters up! The flavor is never diluted, it is rich and delicious!

review/summary: Yay! I &lt;3 Peanut Butter, and now I can actually have it!
review/text: So... my preferred breakfast is 9 or 12 grain toast with peanut butter. But at the end of the week that's a LOT of calories and fat. So I started having cereal or oatmeal and I started losing some of the 10 pounds or so that I've put on in the last couple of years.<br />No matter how much I exercised or ate carefully, that peanut butter was doing me in.  Now I mix a bit of PB2 every morning and save hundreds of calories per week-- and I still get to have my preferred breakfast.<br />The taste? Not going to lie- it isn't exactly the same. But it's damn close and was EASY to make the switch. I don't even measure anymore-- just add a few drops of water at a time till I like the consistency. It takes about a minute-- long enough for my bread to be toasted- so no big deal.<br />I'm lazy and always hungry-- but this absolutely works for me.<br />I'm so delighted to have discovered it.

I've been craving it so badly but it's such a high point count, so I haven't had any, and when I saw this PB2 I knew I just HAD to try it! My husband thought I was crazy, but what did he know?! It actually tastes REALLY good! I was very impressed! I've used it so far by itself on toast, and in a PB & J sandwich and I'm very happy with it. I get to enjoy peanut butter again for half the points!!!! If you're on a diet and love peanut butter, definitely try this! The first time I added too much water, which made it way too creamy, but since then I've lessened the water and it has a natural peanut butter consistency.

review/text: I purchased this item mostly out of curiosity.  I have been hearing about it and people that are on a strict diet trying to lose weight often rave about it.  To me I will never use it as just straight peanut butter on a cracker or bread.  I do believe it is good to put in smoothies, if you want peanut butter in your smoothie.  You can vary the consistency depending on  how much water you use.  For smoothie, you can just add the powder right into your blender.  The taste to me is rather bland.  Sure-obviously it is missing the FAT- but it is lacking in something else as well...just can't put my finger on it...

review/text: This stuff is great because of the fat and calorie content. It still contains some protein like normal peanut butter which is good. Normally I would say that the added salt and sugar isn't neccassary but in this case it definetly is because without it it woud probably be pretty gross. As far as the texture goes don't expect it to be like full fat peanut butter as the texture is sort of "gluey" but not unpleasant. I like to eat it on toast or with red grapes.

review/text: I am a peanut butter lover, but not a fan of the high calories and fat. As an extreme health junkie, I understand the notion behind moderation, but I admit that it's a bit hard to obey when it comes to peanut butter. Because of this, I haven't eaten peanut butter in a long time (about 3 years!)<br /><br />About 2 months ago, PB2 entered my life and I could NOT have been any happier with this product. It's so amazingly yummy and perfect! I use it in powder form for my smoothies or I add water and some cinnamon and use it as a spread for crackers. I also use it for other foods like my baked tofu or sauteed shrimp. I love that you can adjust the consistency depending on the amount of water you add. Sometimes I can make it really thick by adding a little bit of water or more smooth with more water. I love that flexibility. I will be using this product for the rest of my life, as long as its still in production!

Maybe if I were to add it to smoothies like some reviewers did I would have liked the taste. But using it as regular peanut butter was my plan. Unfortunately, it just didn't cut it. The flavor was weird. Not at all peanut buttery. The consistency was ok, the color a little pale, but all that aside, the flavor has to work or the product wouldn't for me. I guess it's time to accept that good peanut butter is high in calories and finding a lower calorie replacement is not in the cards for me. Oh well...I tried.

review/summary: Powdered peanut butter??  YES!!
review/text: Well, I have to say that I thought this would be pretty bad. I admit it.<br />Deconstituted peanuts - wow. Dry, tasteless, useless, but less fat.<br /><br />I have to say that I was wrong!<br />It smells pretty darned good when you open the jar up. It is powder, so<br />I used a knife to only cut half the lid off. That way, if my fumble fingers<br />dropped the jar, I would not spill as much of this - it is pretty pricey.<br /><br />I like peanut butters, but don't eat enough of it to really use it up before<br />it separates into oil/goo.  This is the answer for me. You just mix up what you need!<br /><br />Basically, this is just powder that mixes with water. While directions say two Tbls of powder<br />to one Tbl of water, who wants to really measure peanut butter? Best eyeball judging that I could<br />say for advice, is to get a small bowl, and put enough water in it to be about the amount<br />that you want to have of peanut butter. Use a spoon or fork, either one. Sprinkle the<br />powder over the water generously and mix, mix, mix. If it is too runny for your desired use,<br />sprinkle a little more powder and mix again. Repeat until it is just like you want it. I did find<br />that I had to mix it more than I thought I would to get the desired consistency/texture. If you<br />don't mix it enough, it will feel grainy to the tongue.<br /><br />The freedom to have it slightly runny for dipping, or thicker for spreading, is so nice!<br />While I honestly thought I wouldn't like it, I really do. I made a small batch up, intending to<br />dip my finger in it for taste testing. This is how I learned about not putting so much water in the bowl.<br />I had more peanut butter than I really wanted. So, son and I whipped out a package of Ritz crackers<br />and thoroughly enjoyed dipping/spreading it on the crackers. There was only the color of the bowl<br />left when we were through!<br /><br />If you've been on the fence about it, especially since it is a little costly, just jump in.<br />I can't see any waste in this product (except maybe spilling it). If you are trying to watch your<br />fat intake, this is the PB to eat.<br /><br />I have ordered a jar of the PB2 Chocolate tonight. I simply have to try it too. I hope it is as good<br />as this one!  YUM!  Now, I wonder if the same company might want to make this in almond or cashew<br />versions?!  *HINT TO THE COMPANY*

review/summary: Worth a try!
review/text: From reading all the amazing reviews, I expected it to taste better than it did. I love regular peanut butter, so I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. I think if you manage your expectations about taste, this is a good purchase to ease your PB tooth! It works best mixed with some regular PB and in recipes (versus eating it plain or on a sandwich). Def worth a try!

review/summary: Taste not expected
review/text: I think the concept of this item is great. I have only eaten mixed with water and it's just okay. I don't like that sugar has been added since I only use natural PB that needs to be stirred w/ no extra oils etc. I like PB but am not a 'nut' about it. Perhaps this will taste better mixed with other items so I'll try but since I don't eat lots to begin with, it's not a product I'll repurchase.

review/summary: I thought it was too good to be true.
review/text: I kind of expected something that would taste nothing like peanut butter. Not only does this stuff taste like regular peanut butter, it has the same consistency once you mix it. It has a taste similar to a low quality peanut butter or a high end less sugar healthy kind. Peanut butter has always been my weakness and I am so excited to have an alternative that wont kill my daily diet. It's even good enough to eat by itself without and kind of cracker etc. . .<br />The only down side, why I gave it 4 stars, is the price. It is much more expensive than regular peanut butter, but considering the trade off with so many fewer calories, I consider it worth it.

Theres a slight taste of peanut butter but I'm not sure if I'm tasting it or just smelling it. I love it cause it offers a protein without all the calories. Btw the calories as well as other values are identical in the plain & the chocolate. The real challenge is finding something to eat it on. Better on a cracker than bread. Best on toast

The way to use this with food is endless, be creative. Need to limit foods that contain fat? Now you can have your peanut butter and eat it too! My favorite recipe using this is: Peanut Butter Milk Shakes one at a time as follows: 1 and � cup of no sugar added vanilla ice cream, � -1 cup of horizon organic DHA omega organic 3 milk and 1 and � tsp. of PB2, blend until smooth and drink with straw.  Very happy I've discovered this product thank you. Definite future purchases."

review/summary: Unbelievable!! Price is the only catch.
review/text: I was a little hesitant to try this...how could it possibly hope to imitate REAL peanut butter with any success? But, I love peanut butter but hate the calories, so I decided to take all the good reviews to heart and give it a go. I was honestly shocked when I mixed up my first tablespoons. It felt, looked, and smelled like real peanut butter! The taste is very close...obviously it's not going to taste exactly like real PB, but for the calories you are saving, it's surprisingly on target. Also, when you eat it with other things, as most people do, you don't even notice the difference. I spread it on toast and topped with honey...and it was SO delicious!!!<br /><br />A 45-calorie serving is two tablespoons mixed with one tablespoon of water. Be warned, this makes quite a small amount of peanut butter. It is just enough to coat one slice of toast, and actually, I would like a tad more. So yes, this stuff is very expensive and you don't get very much.

review/text: I freakin' LOVE peanut butter. Peanut butter is a good quick snack, but has quite a few calories. This stuff tastes really close, and you can adjust the amount of water to create the consistency you like.  My only problem is the cost. This jar doesn't make an equivalent jar full of the final product.  To demonstrate, this jar makes enough for about 4 or 5 peanut butter sandwiches.  Again, I am a peanut butter lover, and this tastes great.  My only problem is the cost.  P.S. I've lost 130 pounds over the last 18 months, so to me the cost is worth it.  Just purchase it knowing these facts.

It is so bad that this is the first PB that I have purchased in awhile because as soon as I buy PB, it is gone in one day (yes, I sit down and just eat spoonful after spoonful).

review/text: I read the reviews before trying PB2 peanut butter powder and even with all of the good feedback, I was skeptical. As it turns out, it's surprising and delicious. Getting another jar today. I prepared it exactly as instructed on the jar (2 TBS PB2 powder + 1 TBS water) and it was amazing - more like natural PB without all of the oil and less sweetness than store brands. They add just the right amount of sugar to this product. The total ingredients are peanuts, salt and sugar. 45 cals for 2 TBS. Also, I tried this in Greek yogurt (1 TBS to one container of yogurt) and it was really good and peanuty! You have to try it to believe it. I'm going to try the chocolate version next. I'd like to make a sesame noodle with this and maybe mini donuts or smoothies. I plan to experiment. A LOT.<br /><br />I'll be buying a few for stocking stuffers, too. Great product!

review/text: The powdered peanut butter really does taste like peanut butter, but a bit saltier.  You can change the consistency based on how much water you add, which is excellent for making peanut sauces vs peanut butter to spread on apple slices etc.  I use this powdered peanut butter for smoothies, sauces, sandwiches, and even eating it straight with a spoon.  It is more salty than I prefer, but I think most people would like that level of saltiness.  My only real complaint is that it is super expensive.  If you're using it to spread on sandwiches, it'll only last like 6 sandwiches!  That being said, I still am glad that I buy and use it.

review/summary: This is great! pay attention though; you DO have to mix it!
review/text: I love this stuff! When I ordered I didn't read the description, so when it arrived I was pretty surprised to see a jar of powder! After reading the instructions I mixed some up and tried it out... AMAZING. so good. As other reviews have said, mix it with jelly! It taste just like a regular ole peanut butter & jelly sandwich, for under 200 calories. Try the chocolate one too! Mix it with marshmallow fluff!

review/summary: Good PB
review/text: I've been using the PB2 in my protein shakes and I've been quite pleased. When mixed in, the flavor profile is different than traditional PB such as Skippy or JIF, but still tastes like a quality, full flavored peanut butter. The flavor is potent, and one half serving is usually sufficient to flavor a smoothie made with 1.5cups milk/banana/whey. It mixes well and produces a consistency similar to that of regular peanut butter. At 45calories I've found it an excellent replacement.

review/summary: It's surprisingly good!
review/text: I was actually a little surprised that this was as good as it was, because I've tried some of the other lower calorie peanut butters, like Better N Butter (I think that's what it was called) and I actually spit it out because it tasted so artificial. If you go to the Bell Plantation site, the company that makes this stuff, there are lots of recipes that look appetizing. My only problem with this powdered peanut butter is that it's just not as satisfying as the real stuff because there's no (or not much) fat in it . So sometimes it's hard to only eat a little like you would with normal peanut butter. But the taste is very natural, not fake tasting in any way, and I loved it!

review/summary: Exactly like normal peanut butter!!!!!!!!
review/text: If you are like me peanut butter is your crack! However, at 200 calories a serving it is a large dietary investment. But with PB2 all worries are put to rest. With only 45 calories per equivalent serving you can't get better than that. I love this product. It tastes and has the same consistency as normal peanut butter when mixed with water. Take my review along with all the other reviews and TRY IT.

review/summary: Good..but price is AWFUL
review/text: It's a relatively smaller jar that you get..about comparable to the smaller jars of PB you buy at a grocery store.  I love peanut butter but had cut it out of my diet because of the fat.  This was good when mixed with jelly, jam or honey..you can eat it just like that or spread it on bread/toast.  Yucky when mixed with water to dip fruit...wasn't salty enough and had a funny texture/taste.  Haven't tried it in cooking yet.<br /><br />ON BACK OF JAR ~ 2 Tb serving:  1.5g fat, 94 mg sodium, 5g carb, 2g fiber, 5g protein.  Ingred: roasted peanuts (defatted and powdrd), sugar and salt.<br /><br />Apparently there are other local places where you can get it much more cheaply and without the shipping.  Way too expensive for one jar and the exhorbitant shipping charges.

Also very fast shipping.<br />With most things amazon is a better deal but not in the case of some of these less common food items.

review/summary: a healthier peanut butter
review/text: I have been using Bell Plantation for 3 years and think it is a God send. It works perfectly into the Weight Watchers program giving you all the taste of peanut butter without the caloric cost. Because it is powdered you have the option of making your peanut butter thick or thin. I think Bell's has a great peanut butter taste and I feel good about leaving out all of that artery clogging oil. My three children like Bell's 10years old, 13 years old and 15 years old. I feel good about giving them a healthy alternative. Love it, love it, love it!

review/text: I love this product.  If you love PB but never purchase a jar because you could eat an entire jar in a day or 2, this product is for you.  I loved FitzNuts PB until I bought PB2.  It is superior.  I have it on apples or cabbage.  I don't overeat it because you have to mix it up - takes seconds - with water.  I have even used it in recipes that call for 1/4 cup PB.  It works fine.<br />Just remember, it is not PB.  If you are a die-hard PB Connoisseur, this may not be for you but if you love PB but want something with less calories and fat, PB2 is for you!

review/summary: Good for mixing, but use as supplement to real PB in sandwiches.
review/text: This stuff is really good added to oatmeal or greek yogurt.  As for a PB sandwich?  Not as sure.  I've mixed it with jelly, and it's pretty good, but I missed the texture contrast that you get with real PB.  I mitigate this by adding a very thin layer (I have a problem with putting WAY too much PB on) of real PB to my bread and then supplementing with the powdered stuff.  It works better that way, I think, and I don't get all the calories from using all regular PB.  I probably wouldn't buy this from amazon again because of the price, but I'm glad I tried it, and if it's on sale at whole foods or something I'd buy it.<br /><br />Oh, be careful when you're opening the jar for the first time...no sudden movements or you'll be covered in PB powder, and at this price, every grain is precious!

review/summary: Good, but expensive!
review/text: This powdered peanut butter is quite tasty, either on its own or mixed with water as instructed. The problem is, it is about twice as expensive as normal peanut butter wherever you try and find it. I didn't like the price on Amazon, and Bell Plantation's website charges over $11 to ship their 4 pack, which makes the price of each bottle about $7. $7 is also about the price I've seen in specialty stores as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while it is a healthy, tasty substitute for real peanut butter, I'll be sticking to the real thing due to the price. Plus, nut fats are good for you as long as they're consumed in moderation.

review/summary: Good but not great.
review/text: This review is primarily for the PB2 product (not the chocolate). As an avid PB fan, I wanted to try these, for the obvious caloric advantage over any other PB on the market. The PB2 has a definite "natural" PB-product flavor, and can be mixed to lend a similar consistency to peanut butter. That being said, I found it is not as fulfilling when snacked on alone, with a spoon. That being said, I imagine it would make an amazing replacement for real PB in any cooking recipe or blending protein shake. I did enjoy the chocolate flavored PB2 on its own, and would definitely buy it to snack on by itself again. :)

review/text: This is a tricky product to review.  On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter).  If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars.  However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).  But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor.  So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes.

review/summary: INCREDIBLE WHEN MIXED WITH JELLY!
review/text: I first purchased PB2 in Manhattan and was so excited about its great taste that I bought another four jars and mixed spoonfuls for colleagues at work. You can use PB2 as others have suggested, but I like it on sandwiches. My entire life I've been addicted to peanut butter, so much so that during college I ate 4 lbs of freshly ground health store peanut butter per week! I find that when I mix 2 TBSP of PB2 powder with jelly and put it on a sandwich it tastes as good as any peanut butter sandwich I've ever had.<br /><br />At 55, I'm blessed to be in great shape and have tried to stop eating peanut butter all together but it's impossible. So I'm here to order four more jars of what I consider to be a miracle: PB2!  Mix it with jelly (even margarine or a little butter) and enjoy an extremely low fat, old fashioned peanut butter sandwich.

review/summary: Peanut Butter Flavor without the Peanut Butter Guilt
review/text: I love high-octane peanut butter, but not the fat/calorie content.<br /><br />TASTE: If you are accustomed to low-salt or raw products, the taste will be fine. If someone in the house balks at the taste, you can toss in a dash of fine sea salt or honey (agave works well too). You could easily mix PB2 with PB to wean onto this gradually.<br /><br />TEXTURE: Mixes fast and is very smooth (surprisingly). From the jar, it's similar in consistency to powdered sugar. Open factory seal on jar carefully so it doesn't fly out (trust me).<br /><br />MIXING: Easily mixes using a small spoon or spatula in a gently sloping small bowl (I use a pinch bowl)<br /><br />USAGE: PB2 has recipes on their website (Bell Plantation) and they also sell a chocolate/pb product. I'm a fan of straight PB2 (a spoon by itself) but have had PB2 on crackers, sprinkled on banana/apple slices, and am looking forward to making homemade PB2 ice cream this summer.<br /><br />STORAGE: I was a bit disappointed at shelf life projection.  As a dry product, it should last for years but the company says 10-12 months unopened and 4-6 opened. I would prefer to buy the larger sizes or a case to save more.<br /><br />COST: It can be obtained cheaper elsewhere (like on the PB2 website) but I had free shipping purchases to offset the cost. I wanted to try just one jar before committing to a larger sized container from the company. If you purchase natural products, the price won't be such a shock.<br /><br />BIGGEST PROS: lower calorie and fat content - hands down the best. Dogs like it too ;)<br />BIGGEST CONS: high cost and not a product you can 'make ahead' very successfully (though this could be considered a "PRO" because it helps with portion control. I make it as needed.<br /><br />This product will not change your life, but it will satisfy your peanut butter cravings.

review/summary: Really Good
review/text: This product is very good. I follow the directions exactly and mix it with water.. I havent tried mixing it w/ jelly or honey or anything else, as some others have suggested; the whole reason I bought this was because I wanted a lower calorie, lower fat alternative to regular peanut butter, so for me, mixing it with 150 calories worth of jelly doesnt make any sense.<br /><br />In any case, this is definitely NOT exactly like regular peanut butter.. the consistency is a little different, but I suppose you could adjust that to your own liking by adding more or less water. Also, you can definitely tell that this is a lower fat product than regular peanut butter; I mean, when you take a tablespoon of regular peanut butter, you can instantly taste and sense the richness due to the fat content, and when you eat PB2, you definitely notice the difference. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, just different. Its almost the same as if you are used to eating super premium, high fat ice cream, and then one day you switch to low fat; the low fat may still taste very good, but because you are so used to eating the high fat stuff, you will instantly notice a difference-- however, once you get used to it, it wont bother you.<br /><br />I would say PB2 is the same... its definitely NOT the exact same taste / texture as regular peanut butter, but its still very good. it has a very fresh, "clean" taste. in my opinion, its DEFINITELY worth the compromise, considering the huge amount of fat and calories in regular peanut butter, and how much healthier PB2 is in comparison . I have cravings for peanut butter just about every day, but up to now, I have only allowed myself to eat regular peanut butter about once a week, due to the fat and calorie content...  but now, since finding PB2, I allow myself to have it whenever I want it.<br /><br />By the way.. I tried the PB2 Chocolate version-- I ordered a sample from their website-- it was OK.. not fabulous, not bad. to me, if I am going to really "go for it" and eat chocolate peanut butter anything, its not going to be a low fat version, because its just not worth it. in other words, if I had a craving for a Reeses peanut butter cup, chocolate PB2 would not satisfy that craving. On the other hand, when I have craving for regular peanut butter-- in a sandwich or right off of a spoon, regular PB2 will satisfy that craving without wrecking my diet. Bottom line: if you arent sure whether or not you will like this product, go to the Bell Plantation website and spend the four bucks and order a sample, and give it a try, then you will know for sure before you commit to buying 4 jars plus shipping. ( and folks, the shipping costs almost as much as the 4 jars, so make sure you like this before you order it! )<br /><br />My final verdict is I am pretty sure I will be replacing regular peanut butter with PB2 for as long as they keep making it, and will probably order it by the case in the future to save on shipping.

review/summary: Decent taste, great health
review/text: Doesn't taste as good as real peanut butter of course, BUT the small amount of flavor lost is worth the trade off considering how much healthier it is.  The texture/consistency is also pretty much the same as normal PB once mixed.  If you just care about calories/fat and not so much about sodium, adding salt makes it taste a lot better.

review/text: Can't live without peanut butter and now I don't have to. Great peanutty taste without the over the top fat grams. The powder mixes with a little water and spreads on bread or whatever way you like to eat peanut butter. Anyone on Weight Watchers or any weight loss program should try this product. It is just ground peanuts with the fat removed!
