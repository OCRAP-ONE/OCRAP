review/summary: Fantastic Sampler
review/text: I'm fairly new to loose leaf teas, having bought tea bags my entire life. I bought this as a way to sample many different types of tea. The tea came quickly and was nicely packaged, the tins are great and will likely be kept and reused once the tea runs out. I don't have a scale and cannot tell you exactly how much tea comes in each tin, but by volume its about 2/5 of a cup (100 ml) each. There is a great variety of teas included, I received a tin each of:<br /><br />Cardamom Black<br />Organic Mao Jian Green<br />Organic English Breakfast<br />Organic White<br />Organic Chocolate Rooibos Mint<br />Organic Genmaicha<br />Organic Peppermint<br />Organic Rooibos<br />Organic Chamomile<br />Organic Se Chung Oolong<br />Organic Raspberry Burst<br />Organic Sencha Green<br /><br />Of course, as mentioned in the product description, what you receive will most likely vary. I've tried and found them all to be wonderful. My inexperience with teas makes it hard to draw comparisons to other brands, but I'm very satisfied with what I have received.

review/summary: Mild with a tasty Chipotle flavor. One of my top two Chipotle sauces that I've taste tested - out of seven
review/text: The Tabasco brand is traditionally associated with a very hot pepper (chile) sauce. This company has been branching out and now offers a number of new sauces.<br /><br />This sauce is based on the Chipotle - a smoke-dried jalapeno pepper.<br /><br />The sauce is relatively mild (as is the chile) and it has the unique flavor, typical of this smoked pepper.<br /><br />I'd call this sauce almost sweet - much like semi-sweet dark chocolate BUT with the additional kick of some gentle heat.<br /><br />You either like the taste or don't. The smoked taste of the Chipotle pepper is fairly unique. Sadly, if you like this sauce you could be buying a bottle monthly given its diluted nature. So if you are used to keeping a bottle of Tabasco in your pantry for half a year, it won't happen with this variety.<br /><br />I've been taste tasting 6 other Chipotle hot sauces. This sauce is at or near the top of the other Chipotle sauces. The only real competitor is El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce. The Tabasco Chipotle has more vinegar while the El Yucateco has some added sugar and tomato paste. Both are excellent.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this sauce is far more diluted than the traditional Tabasco hot sauce yet it is far more potent and richer tasting than many other Chipotle based sauces. At least in this sauce the Chipotle flavor is concentrated and the added vinegar is not overpowering. Certainly this is the best tasting Tabasco hot sauce currently available and the only real competitor I can find is the El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce which has less vinegar and a bit more tomato taste. The other Chipotle sauces I have taste tested are so diluted that they lack any real flavor and can be easily dis-qualified.<br /><br />Try a bottle - if you like the Chipotle pepper (I think you will) you'll love this sauce but you should also try the El Yucateco Chipotle which is also excellent yet a bit different. Beyond these two Chipotle based sauces I have not found any other Chipotle based sauces that even come close to these two!

review/summary: The Fourth New Flavor of the Quintessential Condiment!
review/text: This was the fourth modern variation on an essentially unchanged, bestselling product for more than 140 years.  Other flavors are:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZMOY">Orginal Pepper Sauce</a> (hot) (2500-5000 Scoville Heat Units),<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIQV2">Green Pepper Sauce</a> (milder yet) (600-1200 Scoville Heat Units),<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOQI8O">Habanero Sauce</a> (hottest) (>7000 Scoville Heat Units).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOQI6Q">Garlic Pepper Sauce</a> (milder) (1200-2400 Scoville Heat Units),<br />Sweet & Spicy Pepper Sauce (mildest) (100-600 Scoville Heat Units),<br />but this is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DG59I">Chipotle Pepper Sauce</a> (mild) (1500-2500 Scoville Heat Units).<br /><br />Dueling histories of the McIlhenny Company are available: (authorized) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0979780802">Tabasco: An Illustrated History</a> and (unauthorized) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060721855">McIlhenny's Gold: How a Louisiana Family Built the Tabasco Empire</a>, for those curious about how this most remarkable product and business empire came to be.<br /><br />Note: "A pharmacist named Wilbur Scoville invented the Scoville Scale in 1912 to measure the heat of peppers. A 'Scoville Unit' is actually a measure of capsaicin (the chemical in hot peppers that is responsible for their heat).<br /><br />Scoville's test was a comparative taste test that is considered subjective by today's standards. A more sophisticated method is in use today, but in honor of Wilbur Scoville, the unit of measure is still called the Scoville.<br /><br />The capsaicin level in peppers can vary from plant to plant due to local environmental conditions. This means that a pepper's rating is an average measure.<br /><br />The hottest pepper on record is the Bhut Jolokia with a pungency of over 1 million Scoville Heat Units (1,001,304, to be exact). By contrast, the Bell Pepper comes in at less than 100 Scoville Heat Units."

review/text: At first I didn't care for this because I tried to just add the scoop to a little water and gulp it down. This does not work as it is too gritty. However, now I mix it into a morning smoothie and I love it. It gives me noticeable energy and I just feel better on the days I have it. FYI, here is my smoothie recipe that I think tastes great:<br /><br />4 oz water<br />1 scoop Amazing Grass<br />1/2 cup frozen organic berries<br />1 Tbs flaxseeds<br />1 Tbs organic coconut oil<br />2 cups fresh organic spinach<br />4 oz organic juice (POM, acai, etc)<br /><br />I listed the ingredients in exactly the order I put them into my blender to get it to blend properly.

review/summary: Best tasting Amazing Grass flavor!  Only one for me from now on
review/text: I tried several other flavors trying to avoid the 'green' taste as I want to have it more than once a day.  The Acai flavor is certainly palatable but the ORAC with its fruity taste is actually good, especially cold.  I use a reusable opaque drinking bottle so others can't see the solution and I drink several a day around the office adding a little ice to keep it cold.  It is the only flavor I will buy from now on.<br />My wife and sister both said it tasted fine so just about anyone should find it acceptable!!!<br />Like the other flavors, it also has the 'gritty' residue that settles at the bottom and just does not seem to dissolve but not an issue for me.  For now, I am just adding it to water as I don't like having my smoothies turn green.<br />If you have a natural food store near you, try a single serving, travel packet for yourself.  If not, and you are still hesitant about committing to a 30 serving canister, order a box of the travel packets so unused ones can be comfortably used by someone else.<br />Except for the Acai flavor with its very slight green taste, all the others, including the chocolate and dreamsicle, still had a very strong 'green' taste to me.  After trying the ORAC flavor, I even returned the ACAI.  (Thanks, Sunflower and Whole Foods)<br />At the Amazing Grass web site, it is the only flavor with all 5-star ratings!<br />Amazing Grass ORAC and their wheatgrass tablets (again, to avoid the green taste) are a complete combination for me.<br />Good luck in your pursuit of health.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I bought Amazing Grass ORAC last month.  I juice in the mornings so I mixed a scoop with my orange, grapefruit, kale, carrot juice.  It was pretty good, but you can definately taste it.  It's kind of sweet.  I've been drinking it everyday since and I have to say the taste is getting to me.  It's super sweet and I can't seem to disguise it.  I'm going to try to put it in a smoothie.  Maybe that will be better.  On the up side my nails have never looked better, my energy level has improved, and my skin is clearing up which make it all worth it.  I definately advise others to buy this product.

review/summary: Amazing grass, indeed.
review/text: Trying to choke down pond scum is not an easy task. Although if you manage to get through it, and the aftertaste, then the benefits are obvious and amazing.<br /><br />HOWEVER! I'm excited to honestly say this is THE MOST AMAZING supper-green food product I have tried. Don't let the unslightly green hue and sea monkey grainy texture fool into thinking this is like other products, because it is not. You will want to buy yourself a cape and become a super hero after a half hour of taking your daily scoop. The energy and mood lighting effect cannot be denied!<br /><br />I tried this in water, it was not as spectactular. I highly reccomend taking your daily scoop in 8-12 ounces of high pulp orange juice. The pulp will help disguise the texture and the taste is almost delicous-- this is coming from someone who is very particular about gross tasting things. Orac powder is NOT gross or "green" tasting at all this way. Maybe a little.. but trust me... buy a cape and a spandex suite with this purchase.

review/summary: This stuff is Amazing!
review/text: I would give this product 7 stars if I could. I've been using Amazing Grass ORAC for several months now and it has almost completely cleared up my acne. I am in my 40's and have suffered through acne my entire life. Nothing too serious but I would get about 2-3 new pimples every week. I have tried many different products to make it stop but nothing really made that much of a difference. Then I started taking Amazing Grass and to my surprise I have had maybe 2 pimples over the past 3 months, with no other changes to my diet or any products that I am using. Who knew this would make a difference? I only use about half a scoop everyday and mix it in a smoothie. When I don't feel like making a smoothie I just mix it with some almond milk and it tastes good. This goes to show you that what you eat can make a difference.

review/text: I have dropped almost 20 lbs since the beginning of July through a mixture of bootcamp and diet.  My morning Superfood smoothie has been a huge part in that.  Greek yogurt, milk (lactose intolerant use Almond Milk), any sweetners you desire, a scoop of superfood, chia seeds for each fiber, and BAM.  Everything you need in a quick and easy breakfast smoothie that's less than 250 calories (depending on what you add in, of course).  Greek yogurt has almost 50% of you daily protein serving so this will keep you happy for hours.<br /><br />I opted for the ORAC because of the sweetness added in and that it still has a high concentration of greens & fruits/veggies.  The regular Superfood will still give you the highest amount so I call this second best, nutrition-wise.

review/text: I tried this from a single serving packet from Whole Foods. It's yummy and has a fruity berry-ish taste with a purple color. It mixes well but you have to keep shaking to keep it mixed. I tried this with 16 ounces of rice milk, but I think it would go better with juice or possibly water alone. I mixed it the night before and it did not turn thick and gloppy the next morning. It's good and I'd recommend it but I like the orange creamsicle flavor better.

review/text: As far as the taste goes, its very good. I prefer to blend it with some other fruit juices (organic not the sweetened or fructose types, yuk) but, from natural juices I blend with this. This power gives it its berry galore taste. I tried it with just plain water, and its literally tolerable. Its kinda bland with just water. You can however, taste the acai and little crumbs of fruits and veggies. But, if mixed with other stuff you can't really tell. This isn't a miracle drink like many others but, happy it is something healthy to drink rather than soda and other unhealthy drinks.

review/summary: Want your dog dead?  If so, buy this product!
review/text: I was in a hurry as I shopped at my local pet food store late on a Saturday night.  My dogs needed dog food.  I buy a high quality dog food, it's ingredients contain everything my vet wants me to be feeding me dogs. I also wanted to get them some special treats. But in my haste I picked up a bag of these "gourmet" chicken breast treats.  Usually I read the label on everything I give my dogs.  Not this time, they looked healthy and were very similar to other chicken breast treats I normally buy.  Had I carefully read the back of the bag I would have immediately returned them to the shelf and moved on.  The words on the back of the bag "not for human consumption, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling this product"-"made in China" would have tipped me off!!!  I never saw these warnings until after my beloved jack russell became very ill only mere hours after eating one of these treats.  My vet wanted to know what had she eaten that was different?  I handed him the bag-he looked it over in horror.  My dog developed an obstruction from the treat, which caused bloat because nothing could pass, salmonella and e-coli poisoning, and an infection in her heart giving her a 4/6 heart murmur.  She had to undergo expoloratory surgery, 7 sets of xrays, 2 ultrasounds, multiple blood tests,an ecg and we're not done yet.  She is still in recovery, tests still pending.  This was one of the healthiest dogs my vet cared for before this incident.  Never had a health issue in the past, never a heart murmur.  At 9 years old most people thought she was 3 or 4.  I have been told the heart murmur has been caused by the infection settling in her heart, which is now irreversable.  Which means if she makes it through all of this her life expectancy just went from 16+ to 10 or 11.<br />My vet cultured one of the treats and could not believe what disease and bacteria it was loaded with.  I cannot believe I took such good care of her for 9 years and then put her through all of this suffering because I didn't take the time to carefully look the product over. Thank you, Cadet and IMS Pet Products for contributing to my dog's pain and suffering.

review/text: Nina is in love with the Chicken breasts.  Every time she gets one, she jumps into her bed to savor it. She has a very delicate stomach and when she was diagnosed with gastrointestinal problems, we were concerned that she would never enjoy treats again.  What started as a trial became a standard purchasing item.  We give her no more than 3-4 per week and so far, so great.  The treat smells very good and it does justice to the "natural" descriptive.

review/summary: Great Sauce
review/text: I ordered this sauce because it's totally awesome. With the price I thought I was ordered a quart jar and of course I did not know what the shipping would be either. In the end it cost me $18.30 for a pint of this sauce. Sure I could return it and pay shipping again and maybe save 5 or 6 bucks which is not worth the trouble. I highly recommend this sauce but please purchase elsewhere so you are not ripped off like I was.<br /><br />Respectfully,<br />Ceen

review/summary: Fantastic despite itself
review/text: I'm not crazy about corn syrup, but there's something about the way it carmelizes in this sauce that makes it the ideal mop/glaze for smoking pork ribs, poultry or even lamb shanks.  It deserves all the awards.  An outstanding and unconventional sauce that adds a touch of sweet/hot without overpowering the meat.  My go-to easy-grab.

review/summary: Do you care about your healh?
review/text: I bought this product for a kidney cleanse tea suggested by Edgar Cayce. There was no description on the product page but the price seemed to be right so I purchased a bag. The seller shipped it in a timely manner and when I got it, I opened it right away. My wife who was close by had to seat down because she could not breathe and it took us a while to figure out what it was. She is in good health and never had this problem before. We narrowed it down to the watermelon seeds. They are roasted and salted (therefore no good for a tea) and treated with some sort of very strong preservative that I suspect may be illegal in the US because we never encountered it before. I tried eating them out of a strange curiosity a few times, but I started coughing right away so they ended up in the garbage.<br />If you care about your health stay away from these seeds and/or any Ziyad foods for that matter.

review/text: This is a VERY strong roast and a great morning coffee if you need your eyeballs popped open in a hurry!  I would strongly suggest using the largest cup size when brewing this kcup.  I used quite a bit of sweetener and threw in some cocoa powder which really enhanced the flavor and actually made the coffee much smoother.  Next time, I will use even more milk to further dilute the flavor.  This coffee would be a great base for cappucino, frappucino, etc etc.  I picked this up at Bed/Bath/Beyond for $11.99 with 20% off coupon.  It's also available at Target and Safeway.

review/text: The Starbuck's French Roast is a good, bold coffee. But, at almost double the price of other comparable brands (Green Mountain Double Black Diamond for one) I just can't justify  the unrealistically high cost.  I'll stick to the Double Black Diamond.  In my opinion it is equally as bold with just a little more flavor.  Since taste is so subjective, you will have to decide for yourself.

review/summary: Starbucks comes to Keurig at last!
review/text: Partisans of Starbucks coffee have been waiting a long time for it to be released in the K-cup delivery system.  Coffee drinkers who like the Starbucks approach to dark roasting will not be disappointed.  The brew is strong but not bitter, slightly smokey but not excessively so, and with a pleasant flavor palette that, to me, seems dominated by chocolate.<br /><br />I've been a coffee fanatic all my life.  Many coffee fanatics take delight in denouncing Starbucks for a variety of reasons, some valid, some mere pretense.  I'm the first to say that Starbucks is not the best coffee in the world and that the Keurig brewing system does not produce the finest cup.  However--and this is a significant however--when one considers the time saved, the hassle avoided, and the waste eliminated, I find this a very satisfactory way to produce a fresh cup when I don't have time to fire up my grinder and brew the in the conventional way.<br /><br />I won't give up my freshly roasted beans, my dripper pot, or my grinder but I will certainly drink--and enjoy--Starbucks K-cups when the time is just not right for a meticulously hand-crafted pot.

review/summary: Great K-Cup Coffee
review/text: First off, for those of you crying about the price of this coffee......... you probably shouldn't have this coffee maker in the first place. This is the best k-cup I have tried yet. You can use the "larger cup" button on these k-cups and get a great tasting, aromatic, strong cup of coffee. I can even see a little bit of foam around the rim of my cup when the brewing is complete. If you do not like strong coffee (as the French Roast always is) then don't buy this coffee. I will be trying the Pikes Place k-cup next.<br /><br />P.S.  As for the Dunkin' Donuts K-cups, do not waste your time. They are the same price as Starbucks, and you can only get them at the stores. I had my wife send me some of the original blend and it tastes nothing like their coffee.

When you brew this coffee, it has a "head" on it when it comes out of the Keurig spout, it is just like the smell at the SB store, and also has that very fresh taste. I have found that most of the KCups are either crazy weak, or just too acidic for my taste...I swear, thank goodness SB finally got in the KCup game. No, I do not work for SB.

I brew the 7oz size.<br /><br />For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.<br /><br />My favorite k-cups are:<br />Starbucks French Roast<br />Starbucks Caffe Verona<br />Starbucks Pike Place Roast<br />Green Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran Reserve<br />Green Mountain Double Black Diamond<br />Green Mountain Revv<br />Green Mountain Dark Magic<br /><br />Other k-cups I've tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold

review/summary: High price BUT a great cup of coffee...
review/text: Simply the best K-cup I've sampled so far (and I've sampled many).  If you like bold, rich coffee than you should definitely try this one. When it comes right down to it, it's still cheaper than buying a cup of coffee outside of the home (even at a donut store) so I don't see the price as that exorbitant. Sometimes quality comes at a price.

I just purchased this 54 pack, but I have already went through a couple of 12 packs (not beer :-) .  I also recommend the TAZO Green Tea.

review/summary: Just so gross....
review/text: This coffee tastes like chocolate that's gone bad.  It's overpriced and just not very good.  Starbucks has always over-roasted their beans.  I guess if you like that then you might like this coffee.  To my tastebuds however, it was just bitter and gross with a weird off-taste that left me making faces long after the cup was gone.<br /><br />Also, to all the reviewers who are saying that this was finally a strong k-cup, I say bah.  There are many other brands that make a cup just as strong but much better tasting.  This was just swill.  Bitter gross swill.<br /><br />If Coffee People still made their french roast I wouldn't have even bothered putting this in the brewer.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA70">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count</a> is my current favorite for my Keurig.  It's so much cheaper than a Starbucks k-cup.  But even if it weren't, it's still a better cup of coffee.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  Overpriced and over-roasted equals bad coffee.

review/summary: Ortho Weed-B-Gon Max!
review/text: Nothing brings a smile to my face more than seeing a yard full of dead and dying weeds. Key word here - "DEAD!"<br /><br />When I moved into my new home, the front and backyard looked horrendous. The place is overgrown with weeds every summer and always looks disgusting. My son would try to pull the weeds, but it's tough to get to the root. I don't have a green thumb anyway and highly allergic to most plants. In the future I plan to get the yard done over with concrete and bricks where I don't have to deal with nature on that level, but I don't have the funds right now to begin the process. Until then I searched online to try to find something that will give these weeds a knockout punch! Well this is it! I ordered 2 bottles, had my son spray liberally in the back and front yard and I waited for results.  To my amazement this stuff really works. My son applied 2 applications and around the 2nd or 3rd day 95% of the front yard was an ugly shriveled up yellow.  Only 5% of weeds sprung up over a couple of weeks (this could have been the places my son missed) but the rest have seen their last day  even though we've experienced a lot of rain over the past couple of weeks.<br /><br />I plan to order more to make sure these weeds stay away forever! After seeing the results, I'm now a believer.

review/summary: The mangoes are good but the cherries ...
review/text: I usually buy dried mangos at the asian food stores, but when I saw this at Costco, I couldn't resist. A 22oz bag of dried fruit for less than $9 is just too good of a deal. Unfortunately, like a previous one star review, I was overwhelmed by the artificial smell when I opened the package. Upon closer inspection of the ingredients, I think the cherries are to blame. I salvaged the mangoes, and I've frozen the cherries. Not sure if I'll ever get around to using them. See the ingredients and you'll know why:<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Mangoes: sugar, sulur dioxide (which is pretty normal, if not ideal, for dried fruits).<br />Bing Cherries: sugar, citric acid, fruit and vegetable concentrates (color) sunflower oil (???), natural flavors (???)<br />Royal Ann Cherries: sugar, citric acid, fruit concentrates (color), sunflower oil, natural flavor(s)

review/summary: These Won't Last Long!
review/text: I like dried fruits, both as a snack and as an item to pack with my noontime work lunches. Plus, I almost always take them along when I go on camping trips. Nutritionally, they offer almost all the advantages of fresh fruit, but they don't require refrigeration and have a long shelf life if the bag seal is maintained. Typically, I buy the dried fruits in large bags and dole them out in smaller portions from there.<br /><br />Yesterday, I was in my favorite warehouse store and found a large bag (22 ounces) of Kirkland Signature Dried Mangoes and Cherries. Mmmmm, That ought to be good. Two different kinds of mangoes and two different kinds of cherries. Well, they're delicious! Nice mix of flavors. Fresh and chewy with a nice sweet and fruity taste. Yum! These won't last long!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

These aren't satisfying, although they'd be ok if I hadn't paid so much for them!  Way too costly.  It's better and more satisfying to eat two Oreo cookies.

review/summary: Earl Grey elevated
review/text: If you are already a fan of Earl Grey, you will be delighted by the exquisite bergamot in this amazingly bold black China and Ceylon tea blend presented in a beautiful, highly giftable tin box.<br /><br />This tea is available in 35 oz, 8.8oz, 4.4oz and tea bags; I usually get the 4.4oz tin to keep it the freshest. One tin of 4.4 oz is enough for ~100 cups (I use a 1.5' mesh infuser).<br />As usual with Kusmi, the tin is beautiful, with raised flower details and old-fashioned design and colors. Anastasia comes in the dark blue tin.<br /><br />The leaves are whole, a deep black with no other visible ingredients.<br />The nose is extremely bold: lots of bergamot, lime and orange blossom with a very sweet appetizing varietal black tea undertone.<br />The mouth is rich and full and the citrus notes are not acidic.<br />I brew this tea a little lighter than my other Kusmi teas (3-4 min- dark amber, vs my usual ~7min) as the intensity of the oils is strong. However, the tannins are low and the finish very smooth so it is hard to infuse too much. Itdoes not get bitter.<br />I do not add anything but my Mom likes a cloud of milk in hers. Sweeteners are not needed as it is so round in mouth.<br /><br />To my knowledge, Anastasia is the most popular of Kusmi teas. You can also pick it up from Dean and Deluca to avoid shipping or directly from the Kusmi website (where shipping is unfortunately expensive but the choices are ).<br /><br />Try this beautiful tea blend; it is a real luxurious treat!<br />Cheers!

Canned bread..who would have thought!<br />I had never heard of this product, but do like a good dark bread on occasion.<br />The label says to open both ends of the can and push it out..we found this to be a must, as it somewhat<br />appears to have been baked in the can;this was easy to do.<br />Very tasty, B&M Brown Bread has a very dense texture and is nicely moist.Quite filling also. We tried it plain, and with some peanut butter<br />and no complaints from my taste test panel :)<br />The long term storage was a key point in my purchase, as I did not have any other options really for bread,<br />so this is quite nice. Cans have a best by date of 26 months away from my delivery date, so it appears<br />that they are shipping a good fresh product.<br />This is a good product, and one I can recommend if you like or want such things.

review/summary: Bread from a tin can?  Preposterous!
review/text: Bread in a can?  Sounds positively revolting right?  Not so fast.  The  Burnham & Morrill Co. of Portland, Maine has been in the canning business for more than a century now.  These are the folks who bring you that staple of millions of American households--B & M Original Baked Beans.  But the folks at B & M also produce a companion product of old New England-B&M Brown Bread.  This is an item that most Americans have probably never sampled or for that matter ever even heard of.  When you pop open a can of  B & M Brown Bread (which is steam cooked right in the can!) I will be the first to admit that it does not appear to be particularly appetizing.  But looks are deceiving.  B & M Brown Bread has been a popular item around these parts for generations.<br /><br />For lots of New England families the tradition of  having baked beans and brown bread for supper on Saturday continues to this day.  Many of us grew up with beans and franks and brown bread on Saturday nights.  This is just the kind of  rib-sticking, intensely flavored food that we crave around here, particularly on a cold, blustery night.  Legend has it that brown bread is closely related to an earlier bread known as "rye and Indian" (from "Indian" cornmeal) or "thirded" bread from its use of rye, cornmeal, and wheat flours.  Now you might surmise that bread that is actually cooked in a can would be full of preservatives. This is simply not the case.  Despite its downright creepy appearance  B&M canned bread is actually about as natural as anything out there.  The ingredients listed on the can include water, whole wheat flour, molasses, dextrose, rye flour, whey, corn meal, baking soda, buttermilk, salt and corn oil.  Compare that to all of the junk found in your favorite snack food!  What's more, B & M Brown Bread tastes great!  B & M Brown Bread comes in two delicious varieties--Original and with Raisin.  I love them both but am partial to the raisin.  Brown bread is not something I purchase very often these days but when I do it is a real treat.  Just heat and serve!  B & M Brown Bread is great just as is or with some butter and really is the perfect accompaniment to a franks and beans or ham and bean supper.  Try it sometime!<br /><br />Now I am not really sure if you can even find B & M Brown Bread everywhere in the country.  It's great to see that it is available through Amazon.  Around here it sells for about $2.00 a can.  What prompted me to write this review is that I saw this product advertised in a catalogue for $8.50.  Such a deal!  The catalogue describes the taste of B & M Brown Bread this way;  "Extremely moist and dense, this New England treat is made using only natural ingredients and has a rich molasses taste that comes through with every bite".  I would concur.  So go ahead.  Be brave.  For a taste sensation just a tad bit out of the ordinary I recommend that you give this all-time New England favorite a try.  Highly recommended!

review/text: I, like others, saw this product and was curious enough to buy it.  I'm glad I did.  The bread out of the can was dense, moist and smelled somewhat sweet.  After eating a piece and deciding that it was sweet enough that I wouldn't be making any grilled cheeses with it, I read the can and took the suggestion that I try it with PB&J.  It was great.  The molasses taste of the bread went well with the sweet topping.  Although I feel as though I must warn any people reading this, and are thinking of buying the bread...If you do not like molasses, you will not like this bread.

(or, you can be bold and cook it in the can, but good luck with getting it out!)  Getting the bread out of the can is the biggest challenge, at least when you try to make the loaf "neat."  You can't find this product locally where I live now (in Texas), so I ordered it online via Amazon.  I didn't need a case, but the shelf-life of this product is "years," so I'll be stocked for awhile.  This bread is rich with molasses (good source of Magnesium), tastes great toasted with butter, and is quite filling.  A GREAT camping food.  Great with baked beans, and anything one would serve with baked beans... hence, why it's offered by B&M!  Only 4 stars because of the difficulty level of getting the bread OUT of the can!

review/summary: review for B M brown bread
review/text: The service was very good.  I received the item quickly.  I like<br />B M brown bread, and I have not seen it in our local stores recently.  I recommend the product but I suppose it depends on whether you like brown bread or not.  If you like brown bread, try it.

review/summary: Molasses Muffins in a Can?
review/text: The cans are about the size of a chunky soup can.  The bread is a semi-pain to remove, but I love it;  it is a prefect breakfast bread as it is sweet enough to eat without any toppings, but it is not too sweet.  It is very filling as it is the consistency of a moist, thick muffin.  The bread is very fitting for fall/thanksgiving.

review/summary: Most purchased with this item: Jaws of Life
review/text: Seriously, I was very happily surprised with this excellent brown bread. I found it to be nice and moist, with the texture and even the taste reminding me a bit of fresh gingerbread or a good rich muffin. The problem I had, however, was not insignificant. I exchanged emails with a very nice and accommodating representative of B&M, and apparently I got a can with inside walls that somehow escaped being thinly coated with vegetable oil. Hence, especially since the inside of the can has horizontal ridges, vertical to the direction that the bread needs to be slid, the can had a fiendish death grip on the bread. The instructions say you may need to ease the bread out by using a spoon. If only. This only creates a cave in the bread, maybe useful if you are into bread sculpting. Even using the cutaway lid, which should be the perfect size, you just keep compressing the bread on that side, of course with every quarter-inch or so of compression you're losing slices you paid for. The simplest way for me was sliding a thin steak knife around the edge, but since, again, the can has those internal ridges, you end up mangling/losing part of the product. Overall, ordering this bread as long-term backup is perfect for me, so I will probably order again. But it is a little depressing that we just launched another rover to Mars, to join another that is still operational, yet we can't manage to get a simple vegetable oil coating consistently inside of a can of bread. Out of twelve cans purchased by yours truly, so far I have opened four, each time soon wanting to call emergency services to bring in the Jaws of Life, but then figuring they might be needed more out of the highway. That aside, Thumbs Up to B&M for a delicious long-term-storage product.

review/summary: Dented Cans
review/text: The bread itself is very moist and flavorful.  However, I ordered a 12 pack, and when it arrived, every single can was dented.  As most people buy this product for long term storage, this is definitely a problem.  I will probably buy more bread in the future, but will purchase it from another vendor.

review/summary: Good bread, poor packaging/handling
review/text: I ordered a package of 6 cans previously, and that order was completed as I hoped. So when I bought this order of 12 cans, I was expecting more of the same. However, of the 12 cans, 6 were dented, and 4 of them badly. It doesn't appear the seals were broken and the cans aren't swollen, etc, so the bread is fine. But based on the other reviews, anyone about to buy this product needs to be aware of the condition it might be in when you receive it.<br /><br />As for the bread itself, it is delicious. It's very dense and fairly sweet. It goes well toasted with butter or with peanut butter (to my taste buds, anyway). This stuff isn't available in stores here in Texas to my knowledge, so I'm glad I can buy it on Amazon!

review/summary: Yummy yum yum!!!
review/text: Excellent product! Absolutely the best canned bread I have ever had the pleasure of sinking my teeth into. It is hard to find in my area so I was happy to be able to purchase it on Amazon. It was about the same price as the grocery stores and there's FREE shipping! It made this bread a bargain in my eyes.<br />I purchased 2 cases of plain and 2 cases of the raisin. The breads are sooooo fresh!<br />Easy to get out of the can if you remove both lids and run a table knife down, and around, the inside of the can. Use one of the lids to push the bread out of the can.<br />Try it if you have never had it. You're worth it!!
