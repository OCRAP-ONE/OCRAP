review/text: Beware -- This is a bulk food item. These are NOT individually wrapped as shown in the picture accompanying the listing. Due to the packaging, they can not be left out in a candy bowl for an extended period of time as they will dry out. The packages I received had NO lime flavored pieces as stated in the product description. The price is very competitive if you can live with the deficiencies.

review/summary: A Christmas tradition in my family
review/text: Don't know when Sunkist started making these, but somewhere along the line my parents discovered them and always had a bowl of them sitting around when we gathered for Christmas.  What a treat!  The flavors are great, and strong enough so you don't have to guess from the color which flavor you've got in your mouth.  The store Mom always bought theirs from eventually closed and for several years we didn't have our Sunkist gems.  Now I order from Amazon every year and have them sent ahead of visitors, and those that can't make the trip get their own bag to enjoy.  I'm sure these are equally deliscious any time of the year, but they say "it's Christmas" to us.

review/summary: There maybe better sardines on the market, but they are not as available  or as consistant as King Oscar sardines  in Olive Oil
review/text: Finding consistently good sardines in the American market is a challenge.  I've tried cheaper, but there is always a nasty can in my purchases.  I have never had a bad can with the olive oil version of King Oscar.  I first had these in the 1960's with the old key wrapping the lid off the top can.  Nothing except the can has changed.  But I will say the packaging from decades ago was more impressive, if that matters at all.  And yes I know there are some southern European brands that are fantastic and probably the height in sardine quality.  BUT, I've found them to be hard to find and even worse, priced too high.  Maybe there are other sources I do not know about, but until that day, I'm buying cases of 12 for delivery.  (there are no consistent local sources for this product locally anymore, sigh...  my guess is, if there is a large Scandinavian population like the Midwest, it might be much easier to pick up on the grocers shelves.)

review/text: I rarely write Amazon reviews, but this review felt necessary. I've been buying these for years because they used to taste the best in my opinion. Now they are atrocious. This is my 2nd bad batch in a row (and from different retailers). The sardines taste soggy and leave a horrendous smell in my mouth.

review/summary: Spoiled by King Oscar's
review/text: I've never been a big flesh eater of any kind and was vegetarian for the past 3 or so years.  Now that I'm into low carbing,  it's taking me awhile to get used to eating fowl and fish again.  (I don't have the taste for beef anymore.)  However, sardines had always been a favorite of mine since childhood -- any brand as long as it was in oil -- but once I tried King Oscar sardines in olive oil some years back, I was hooked on nothing but King Oscar's and to this day can't eat any other brand without throwing the whole can away after one bite.  (My husband and children never liked sardines.) They're so tender and delicate and flavorful.  I'll eat them straight out of the can with just a little sea salt sprinkled over the top. That's it. Mmmm good. No crackers or anything else needed. I get them from Wally's (Indiana as well as Alabama) and purchase 2-4 at a time so I'll have them around whenever I get the urge for "something but don't know what."  Some people posted they taste like cat food (?).  I have no idea whether that's true or not.  I just know they agree with _my_ taste buds so there's no need to throw away any unopened cans -- consider donating them to any church's or city's food give-away program where someone else might consider them a delicacy and a blessing.

review/summary: I love KO sardines!
review/text: This is the best tasting, commercially available sardine, in my opinion.  I have been periodically hungry for sardines for more than 5 decades!  I have eaten cheap'n'skunky brands and then there are the extra premium choices.  King Oscar products are usually excellent & safe safe choices. After dining on about 36-40 cans of these over a couple years, I conclude they are the best sardine available for the money! These are the smaller, two-layer sardine with skin & bones, but are completely easy to eat & digest; also more food value. The olive oil used is light & tasty fresh. I mix a can of these sardines with various salad stuff & greens & balsamic or red wine vinegar for a gonzo nicoise salad!  These sardines also rock with a vinaigrette dressing or even just lemon! BTW, as a result of my tastes & experiences, I conclude that not all sardines caught world-wide are processed or preserved the same ways.  Price alone does not guarantee value & quality. Of all the other KO, Crown Prince brand sardines etc, these are my #1 choice for eating in salads and out of the can or on toast . . . You get the idea I am sure! :-)

review/text: These are the traditional smaller sardines I've never found elsewhere.  Bit of an unexpected taste, though.  Probably attributable to the oil they're packed in.  Haven't had King Oscar's since I was a kid and was expecting a more fishy taste, which these don't have - but I thought that was missing from the experience.

When we are washing turnip green leaves (like the ones we cook in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook) or collard green leaves (like the ones we cook in The Collard Patch) we toss in about two tablespoons of baking soda into water where we are washing the green leaves.  Then we leave them soaking there a few minutes.  The critters loosen their grips from their secret hiding places on the spines portruding on the back sides of the leaves, and they float to the top.<br /><br />We use baking soda in our bath water to relieve us from the itching and burning caused by chiggers, which plague us in the South.<br /><br />It is fun to mix it with vinegar and put it in a toy boat or submarine, and it is great for making a model volcano.<br /><br />Few products are as versatile as baking soda!

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I eat one of these for breakfast 5-6 days a week.  Usually after I work out in the morning while on the way to work in the car.  This happens around 8am with a 20oz bottle of water.  I eat them because they taste good and keep me full until lunch.  If I'm going to work out and watch my diet, it better taste good and fill me up.  The bar is chewy so it doesn't crumble all over me while I'm driving.  I decided on these after a lot of trial and error with many brands and different types of bars.<br /><br />The other thing I like about these bars is that for some reason I haven't gotten tired of them.  I haven't even tried the Peanut Butter or other flavors offered.  I started eating these things the first week of January 2011 and it's been pretty non-stop.  I even take them with me when I travel to keep me away from fast food.  I play a lot of golf and that's where I discovered these bars.  The bars are almost impossible to find in stores and paying retail at the golf course can get expensive.  I have Amazon Prime so it ships to me for free 2nd day UPS.<br /><br />I do P90x so I'm pushing it pretty hard on the workout and have a strong appetite.  As far as my diet goes, I eat one First Tee bar in the morning, eat anything I want for lunch less than 1,000 calories, snack in the afternoon with trail mix and then have a light dinner usually less than 750 calories.  I started at 230 pounds and 25% body fat and I'm down to 185 and 13% body fat.  Just have another 10 pounds of fat to go by the end of the year to reach my goal.<br /><br />Tip:  If you live in a hot area.  They will melt so don't let them sit outside all day when they're delivered.  If no ones home during the day, send them to your work.  They will still taste good if they melt, but won't look as good.  My son eats the 10th tee peanut butter bar prior to wrestling and likes those.

review/text: I have toy poodles (it's a small breed, not an actual toy made of plastic) and they do not like to eat hard dog foods.  It got to the point where they were underweight because they refused to eat all of the different dog foods we tried.  Now that we are using the Moist & Meaty they are happily eating and back up to a healthy weight.

review/summary: Good for finicky dogs
review/text: Say what you want about this product's composition, but my Husky is 14 and a half years old and has eaten this dog food since she was a pup.  Huskies are very finicky eaters, sometimes going a day or two (or more) without eating. She also rejected a number of dry foods that we tried both in taste and other unmentionable rejections that I'll leave up to your imagination.  Needless to say we were wasting a lot of food (and money) on stuff she wasn't eating.<br /><br />Moist and Meaty will last a few days in the bowl.  She eats it regularly and is in amazing health for her age with a puppy-like spring in her step.  The vet is even shocked by her health and longevity.  Is it all the result of the food itself?  Definitely not.  But she's no worse for wear because of it and we rarely waste any.

review/text: My dog loves this food. Mostly used as an added "treat" to the normal science diet food (50/50 mix). It is very soft and easy for her to eat. My veterinarian likened it to "snickers bars" most likely because it contains High Fructose Corn Syrup, but she really enjoys it.

review/summary: Good dog food
review/text: It is hard to find soft food for a dog without teeth. My poor baby is 13 and has lost his little teeth. It is difficult for him to chew dry dog food and he doesn't like canned. I tried Bil-Jac, but he wasn't all that fond of it. He will eat the moist and meaty. I give him half a pouch in the am and half at night. He seems to like it and it is easy to chew. This isn't considered a premium dog food, but I can't find anything else. The price is great from Amazon and they ship fast.

review/summary: This stuff killed my dog...
review/text: Okay, he was 12 years old already but he was always a healthy dog (Westie). He ate this "dog food" for the last few years of his life, nearly every day (unless we got something else, which was rare). In the last six months, he had many seizures, not holding his urine, and eventually could not walk straight. He also had a stroke. Guess what? This "Moist & Meaty" crap has HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP as its SECOND ingredient! We think that our dog suffered from diabetes as a result of eating this stuff and that it was the reason, along with older age, behind his poor health condition during his last days.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS! It has way too much sugar. Even if it's a sugar "substitute," it has been proven to be harmful. You want your dog to be healthy, right? Make sure to check all the ingredients when searching for the right dog food. THIS IS NOT IT.

review/summary: Fantastic Grits that Can't Be Beat (recipe included in review)
review/text: As a native Southerner, I've eaten grits all my life but I'd never had yellow, coarsely ground corn grits before I tried Bob's. From the moment my family tried these grits about two or three years ago, we've eaten no other grits. We cook these grits every weekend, usually Saturday and Sunday mornings. Oh, we've tried a few good regional products, but they're just not as good as Bob's (for instance, Lakeside yellow grits are good, but because they're more finely ground, Lakeside is a bit too creamy, tasting almost like a corn porridge). I prefer the more coarse grind of Bob's yellow grits, and the flavor is exceptional. The corn flavor in Bob's comes through, but not in an overpowering way - not to sound like a geek foodie, but Bob's yellow grits have a fantastic taste and mouthfeel. It's hard to explain, but I recommend you try them. If you're not sure you want to bite off a bulk multi-bag purchase via Amazon, then check your local grocery store (Publix in the Southeast carries Bob's, as do many organic/gourmet grocers). Regarding price: Bob's Red Mill products aren't cheap, but the company fills a very unique niche (Gluten-free products, unusual flours, etc.) and I'm willing to pay the price to keep the company from disappearing. Plus, every product from Bob's Red Mill that I've ever tried has been superior, including these grits.<br /><br />Oh, and NEVER follow the cooking directions on a bag or box of grits - that's the primary reason non-Southerners think grits are nasty, because they make grits without the necessary amounts of butter, salt and milk or cream. Also, these are not quick cook grits, so it will take about 15-20 minutes from the time the water boils to achieve smooth, cooked grits. To feed four people (assuming you also have pancakes and a meat for breakfast), use three cups water brought to a boil, then gently shake about 2/3 cup of grits into the water. Once the water/grits combo comes to a boil, immediately lower the heat to simmer and stir frequently. [A note about lumps: if you don't stir often enough, you get lumps; if you dump the grits in, rather than shaking them in slowly, you get lumps.] Add two or three tablespoons of salted butter, then an unholy amount of salt. I'm afraid to measure how much salt we actually use (we salt to taste as we cook), but I would guess we use two or more teaspoons of salt. To avoid oversalting, start with one teaspoon of salt, taste when you're almost done, then add additional milk and salt to taste. Depending on how thick you like your grits, add additional water (we prefer to use 1% milk) to thin them out a bit. You can also add chopped bacon or country ham to your final product for flavor.<br /><br />A word about polenta:  Any Southerner can tell you that grits left in a pot to cool become polenta... so go ahead, and impress your Yankee and West Coast friends by "grilling up" leftover slices of your breakfast for dinner. Remember, the Americas introduced corn to Europe (including Italy), so grits came first.

review/summary: This is best for grits or polenta
review/text: Once you've made this you'll never eat instant white grits again. These grits have a rich corn flavor and need little enhancement-just a little salt and butter.  I used these to make a South Carolina shrimp with grits that was the best I've ever made. They are also identical to the Italian polenta.  Don't buy those silly cylinders of precooked polenta or boxed instant polenta.  This product is easy to make on the stove top and ridiculously easy to make in the microwave: just bring the water to boil in a large glass container ( I like my 16 cup measuring  cup), stir in the grits while stirring, along with salt to taste, and microwave until it's thick and creamy, stirring every couple of minutes. Eat it soft or cool it and cut to make grilled or  fried polenta.  Amazon is offering a good price also.

review/text: I've learned to trust that with Bob's Red Mill I will get very good quality every time. This makes really flavorful and nicely textured polenta.  I also use it to replace part of regular grind cornmeal when making cornbread since the grind is coarser and improves the texture of the cornbread.

review/summary: This item is NOT the ORGANIC Grits
review/text: I purchased these depending on the stated CERTIFIED ORGANIC SEAL. This item however is NOT the ORGANIC Grits which means they could be made form GMO corn.  No where on the package does it say ORGANIC and in research I found that Bobs does have an Organic Grit, but it is NOT this one. (even though amazon has posted the Certfied ORGANIC SEAL!!) BUT WOW * I contacted Amazon "Help" regarding this issue and was immediately issued a refund for 'product not as described'.  Amazon has been my favorite online retailer for several years and I am subscibed for auto ship on over 16 items.  Now I can add that they indeed have a great customer service policy.

review/summary: Great Polenta Grind
review/text: I had been using "coarse" ground supermarket corn meal to make my grilled polenta for years. It never had the same texture that I grew to love in my years in Northern Italy. The taste was right, but the texture was too smooth. And then I read some information on the interwebs about Bob's Red Mill corn grits. I don't know where I read the snippet about a true course grind versus a market course grind. But I now know that there is a difference. The market course grind available in the US is not adequately course enough for a true Italian polenta; it's too small and makes a mush/baby food consistency. With Bob's Red Mill grind, the difference is palatable. With the larger grind, I get a more toothy, substantial mouth feel in my grilled polenta. I feel like I have been transported back to Piancavallo, Italy in the dead of Winter, eating grilled wild pig and vennison with a side of the most luxurious polenta. Bob makes the difference between good polenta and sublime polenta. This grind is in keeping with the northern Italian polenta tradition. It is worth your time to supply your pantry with a 4 pack.

review/summary: If you like yellow corn grits- these are for you!
review/text: As a southern boy I have always enjoyed grits and butter. I used to live near Zellwood Florida and every year went to the corn festival and bought about 5 pounds of yellow grits from a farmer who always had a portable grit mill there. I moved to the Florida keys about 10 years ago and found the local stores only carried instant grits or white corn grits.<br />Recently I just couldn't stand it anymore and went searching for yellow corn grits! I was lucky enough to run across<br />Bob's corn grits and ordered some right away. They arrived 2 days ahead of schedule and I could hardly wait for breakfast this morning to have some. Well; I'm here to tell your these are the absolutely the finest grits I have ever had, and I've eaten a lot! I don't know what kind of corn is used, or how it is processed but they cook to the perfect consistancy in about 6 minutes and when you consider even the instant kind take 2 minutes in the micro It is well worth waiting that little extra time! I don't know how you can go wrong with this man's product.<br />Mike Williams<br />Key Largo, Florida

I perfer these grits to any I have tried in the store. Whole Foods was out one day and I tried some fancy chef brand and they were too gooey. Now that I don't live anywhere near a Whole Foods, getting them off Amazon in bulk is the only way for me to get them. Highly recommend!!! And they can be made very quickly. I add grits and water into a microwave safe bowl, microwave on high for 90 seconds, stir, go another 30 seconds or so, add more water if you want it creamier.

review/text: I grew up eating a "German" version of grits. We got used to the courser grind of corn and for awhile it was hard to find. Once I found Bob's I've never looked back. The grits are great and the course grind make a nice breading for pork chops too. My dad is very hard to please because things just arent as good as he remembers growing up in the "old country." He LOVES Bob's Corn Grits and has me order the 4-pack for him every couple of months.

review/summary: Great quality and flavor
review/text: I never liked grits, despite growing up in the South.  Mom frequently cooked grits, but the mixture looked very unappealing and I couldn't bring myself to enjoy them.  She cooked them in a very deep south way, with plenty of bacon grease and black pepper, and the grits spread across the plate.<br /><br />As an adult, I first tried grit cakes at the Tupelo Honey Cafe in Asheville NC.  They were firm and dense, cut into triangles and lightly sauteed, and served with a fresh tomato relish and sour cream. The flavor and texture was very different from what I remembered being served as a child. I was instantly hooked. I couldn't believe this was grits!<br /><br />I bought Bob's Red Mill grits specifically to cook grit cakes at home and found a few fantastic recipes to get me started.  These grits have a deep corn flavor and the quality can't be beat.<br /><br />If you are interested in learning how to use these grits to make grit cakes, I would like to suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449400647">Tupelo Honey Cafe: Spirited Recipes from Asheville's New South Kitchen</a> which is an amazing cookbook and has other recipes for grits as well. I originally learned to make grit cakes from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1557884714">Cafe Flora Cookbook</a>, another favorite cookbook.<br /><br />Grits can be so much more complex than the dish my mother used to make.  I'm glad I gave them a chance as an adult, and love that I can buy Gluten Free grits at such a great price on Amazon.

They end up cooking into a light golden color.<br /><br />Amazon's price of $[...] can't be beat. They were shipped perfectly in a Bob's Red Mill brand box holding the 4 packages and that box was laid inside an Amazon box snugly. For $[...] with 4 packages it is a steal--- when you think about how much money you can spend on Grits in a restaurant.  It's just as good at home and takes little time to make.

review/text: Howdy from Texas!  I had run out of course-ground grits that I bought from an Amish miller and could not find any really good ones in my local stores.  I had resorted to using regular yellow cornmeal but that just ain't right.  I want some TEXTURE to my grits, not just a smooth, creamy paste.  Bob's Red Mill fills the bill and I am SO happy we bought them.  They come in a box with 4 packs of grits.  I love the way the box top comes off and the base works great for holding the bags upright on my pantry shelf.  However, I don't think they'll be on the shelf very long because these boogers are GREAT!  Very "corny" flavor with just a little toothiness to them... perfect!<br /><br />I also like the indredient list on the package: Ground corn.  And it's not that genetically modified crap that is invented by mad scientists.  Don't they know that "It's not NICE to fool with mother nature!"

I will never forget the headache and other withdrawl symptoms when I stopped cold turkey, and I never want to be dependant on something so much so that I have to have it or the headache!<br />I have tried all sorts of decaffinated coffees, and for me, D'Vita does it best.

review/summary: Makes everything taste good
review/text: I normally buy this seasoning in the grocery store however it comes in the same canister with 2 other seasonings that we don't use nearly as much as this one. In addition to the 3 seasonings being hard to find in the grocery store, now I can get the only one that we use and stop wasting the other 2. This stuff makes everything taste so good! I normally use it for italian dipping sauce for bread, but put it in some burger meat last night and the burgers were wonderful!

review/summary: My choice
review/text: Many stores carry the little plastic containers that have a four selections of spices for dipping in olive oil. The problem is that there is only a small amount of each. I searched and found the one I always used. I use it for dipping, mix some in flour to bake chicken breast, sauces etc. The really neat part is that they stack on top of each other and lock together.

review/summary: Good value--weak tea
review/text: I ordered this product because of the value and that it is sometimes a challenge to find Twinings decaf tea. However, if you like the traditional (stronger) Earl Grey tea, be aware that this tea is the "lite" version. It states right on the box that it is a milder version and not as strong. (I don't think this is noted on the web description.) I just let it brew a little longer, but it is still not as strong as the original version. So if you like strong tea, I would not order this (at least in the decaf version).

review/text: I drink a lot of tea, several times a day, and have been doing so since childhood. I first tried Twinings Earl Grey in high school and was hooked.  I've tried many other Earl Grey teas since, but this is by far the very best.  A perfect cup of tea.  Just the right strength, blend of flavors and smoothness.  I recommend it with sugar/sweetener and milk/creamer, but some people also drink it black.  Even my husband, who is not a big tea drinker, loves this.  Excellent -- highly recommend both the decaf and the regular.

review/summary: There's not enough Pie in this faux Pumpkin spice mix
review/text: For the Holidays last year, I decided to forgo the legitimate Pumpkin Pie and try something a bit lighter/healthier. I'm familiar with Jell-O's No Bake line, such as their delicious No Bake cheesecake, so I figured their Pumpkin Pie (style) mix should be good too. Well, it's not. At first taste, I thought "that's not bad!", but after a few mouthfuls of it, I could barely stand it anymore. There are two main problems I find with it. First of all, the consistency is off, it doesn't really get to a Pie consistency, more like pudding as another reviewer mentioned. I've added less milk (1.5 cups) and that helped a bit with the texture (now more like thicker pudding). Second, in order to compensate for the lack of any real Pumpkin, Kraft put wayy too much ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg or whatever else in there. The pumpkin spice flavor is overly pronounced and upsets my stomach after a few spoonfuls. So now I'm stuck with a few boxes of this stuff trying to figure out how to use it and/or get rid of it.  At the very least, I could use the included crust mixes for another one of Jell-O's better flavors.

review/summary: Great taste..but not less filling.
review/text: These taste great, but their health factor is a bit questionable (I know....they are brownies after all).  They have deceptively labeled there Nutrition Facts section on the packaging.  There is only 1 brownie, but the serving size reads 2 per container...wait, what!? First I thought..."Did someone eat my other brownie?! It's not wise to piss off the roided, fat brownie lover off".  But then I realized that there was no other brownie!!! Trust me, I looked.  So in other words, if your eat the entire brownie (as if you wouldn't)...you have to double what it says for fat, calories, etc...dumb.<br /><br />Pros - Taste, 20g of protein...for 1 brownie, not half the brownie.<br />Cons - 12g of fat and 340 calories, virtually no other apparent health benefit (it's not fortified with vitamins/minerals), they don't do that well in hot environments (they tend to melt).

review/summary: Awesome Snack with few Drawbacks
review/text: First thing is first, I would call this more of a protein bar than a brownie. I only say this because if you are expecting a rich, moist, creamy dessert then you will be sorely disappointed. But as far as a protein bar goes, this is pretty good tasting.<br /><br />I would argue that the nutrition is near perfect. Each brownie has 20 grams of protein, 38 grams of carbs, and 6 grams of fat. If your eating this as a supplement to body building (and I assume you are) then you would have difficulty saying that there is too much fat or too many carbs when comparing it to an ideal diet. And if your eating several meals per day (shame on you if your not) its no problem at all to alter one of the meals for the daily desired amount of fat and carbs. The only real complaint I have about the nutrition is that there is 24 grams of sugar per brownie which is a little high.<br /><br />The taste is great, it taste like a brownie. Its drizzled in an icing (probably where alot of the sugar comes from) which really enhances the flavor. The texture, however, is fairly grainy and dry. This is to be expected as it is meant to be "healthy" and as a supplement.<br /><br />The price is fair, 2 dollars a brownie on amazon and 2.50+ in the store. This isnt something that you would want to focus the majority of your diet on as the cost does tend to add up.<br /><br />Pros:<br />20 grams of proten per bar, balanced with 12 grams of fat and 38 carbs<br />Great alternative to junk food<br />Taste very good, especially given some of the other protein bars out there<br /><br />Cons:<br />The sugar is a little high<br />The texture is a dry<br />Its fairly expensive compared to lean meat / protein powder

Just pack them individually as one serving and have 24 per package rather than 12, but other than that I have no complaints.  They are fudgy delicious and chock full of protein.  They are Wheat Free and Flour Free which is an absolute plus for my son who is wheat sensitive.  He grabs one in the morning, heads off to class and nibbles on the whole brownie, (unfortunately) and is set until his later day lunch.  I have these sent to him every month.

review/text: I've tried them all, and this brownie is great for the trail.  It's a delicious brownie, and there is no hint of a protein bar at all.  Loaded with protein and calories yet small, it fits into my bear vault easily.  Thank you Lenny and Larry's;)

review/summary: Best ever!
review/text: I have gotten the peanut butter as well. These are my total fav. I wish they didn't cost so much, but they are amazing! They dont have a chalky taste at all! just wonderful. I always wish it was just one serving size, but still less fat and calories then most protein brownies! Love these! I will continue to buy them. Also amazon delivers them super fast.
