review/summary: yummy
review/text: I once read that the reason there's a difference between American and European chocolate is that Americans view chocolate as candy while it's considered dessert in Europe.  This heavenly chocolate is definitely in the dessert category.  The almonds are perfectly tiny and dispersed throughout rather than the big chunks so often found in the candy bar purchased from the rack near the checkout.  The flavor is incredible.  I love chocolate and this one is definitely in my top five.

review/summary: SUPER CHOCOLATE - SUPER FLAVOR
review/text: We had absolutely no idea what to expect when we ordered this bar, but since we're chocoholics we didn't see how we could  go too far wrong.  Not wrong at all!  We're loving this candy.<br /><br />  The label gives one the impression this is a milk chocolte - for us, it is closer to a dark  chocolate yet mellow and more mild.  The flavor stays with you, and the candy literally melts in your  mouth.<br /><br />  The bar is a generous 3 1/2" by 6" and scored in triangles rather than squares (2 bite triangles for us).  It is a thin bar yet each  bite is more than satisfying.<br /><br />  As we're huge fans of sea salt we might have liked a stronger sea salt taste - the almond bits add a nice small crunch.  We enjoyed it as dessert with the last of our glasses of red wine - bliss.<br /><br />  We'll be ordering  more!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

review/summary: Great Quality
review/text: A subsidiary of Hersheys, Scharffen Berger is a small company in San Francisco that actually makes chocolate, from the beans. It deals directly with the growers to select and purchase high quality cacao beans of specific origins. Scharffen Berger does not advertise its chocolate as "Fair Trade" chocolate, but has a policy of not buying beans from the west coast of Africa, where the industry is know to practice slavery and use child labor. Note: this chocolate is not labeled "organic."<br /><br />This is a 41% cacao bar labeled as milk chocolate with sea salted almonds.  The bar has a nice, smooth, glossy appearance. The smell is of a French confiserie. Yes, just close your eyes and draw a deep breath. This scent reminds me of molded chocolate and chocolates wrapped in thin foil with fancy ribbon.<br /><br />The bar breaks with a nice snap, indicating that the chocolate has been well tempered. Small pieces of chopped, roasted and salted almonds are evenly scattered within the bar.<br /><br />The chocolate melts is creamy as it melts in your mouth. You taste caramel. It is sweet but not too sweet. The saltiness appears after the chocolate melts, leaving the almonds on your tongue. The combination is very tasty. The chocolate has a pleasant finish, not dark, not overly sweet, just right.<br /><br />The allure of this bar was so intense, it required finishing the entire bar. Need I say more?

review/text: I do  not think I am a huge fan of chopped up really small nut pieces in chocolate.<br />This brand of chocolate IMO it divine, I also tried the milk chocolate bar and LOVED it!<br />I usually LOVE almonds in chocolate instead of plain chocolate, but this case it was not true.<br />I think the nuts were chopped up too small to really give that satisfying nutty crunch and taste, in essence "watering" the sensation down.<br />It is still a great chocolate bar brand!!!

review/text: These chocolate bars are delicious. I liked how they weren't too sweet like many milk chocolate bars can be. I also liked the hint of sea salt. I had been craving chocolate bars with sea salt in them after trying the Lindt kind. If you like those you will probably like these as well. These are similar but a little less sweet.

review/summary: Delicious chocolate, lightly salted almonds...used to sweeter flavor
review/text: Great chocolate bars from both an ingredient and flavor standpoint.  If you're the type that enjoys the sweet and salty combination, these milk chocolate with salted almond bars should be at the top of your list.  They're quite good, and have a very smooth texture as well.<br /><br />My biggest complaint, which is just personal preference, is that other chocolate bars I enjoy are a bit sweeter.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHYR84">Newman's Own Organics Milk Chocolate Bar</a>, while being only 34% cacao are great and have the additional sweetness I prefer.  (Hey, it's chocolate - may as well have a bunch of sugar to go along with it!)  More mainstream (but infinitely better than what "Hershey's" and other popular companies call "chocolate")...Ghirardelli.  Those also make delicious chocolate that I prefer because it's a bit sweeter.<br /><br />Overall, these are great - but I have a couple others I still prefer.  (And caramel filled Ghirardelli?  Will anyone ever make something so smoothly delicious?)

review/summary: Chocolate bliss
review/text: Who doesn't appreciate good chocolate? I particularly love chocolate with nuts.  The cheaper chocolate tends to be a little too sweet.  The Scharffen Berger bar of milk chocolate with sea salted almonds is in a whole other class from your supermarket chocolate with almonds.  The milk chocolate is rich without being overly sweet.  The nuts to chocolate ratio is just right - and you actually taste the salt with the almonds.  The bar is also just the right thickness so that each piece tastes like a carefully measured treat of high quality milk chocolate, crunchy almonds and just a hint of salt.<br /><br />I shared the first chocolate bar with some discerning friends as a fun test of sorts.  Everyone noticed the quality of the chocolate.  We savored it instead of wolfing it down.

review/summary: smooth flavor, ample size, good for gift baskets
review/text: In my world, Salt + Chocolate = Love.  Unfortunately, this bar lacks enough salt to merit the inclusion of the word "salt" in the bar's title.  Despite this, I still found it to be a good bar.  Here are some likes:<br /><br />1)It lacks artificial flavors and the taste is clean and smooth.<br />2)It is bountiful in its almond content; wherever you choose to break the bar, you are sure to see at least several almond pieces.<br />3)I didn't find the bar to be very bitter and would consider this Scharffen Berger bar to be a good introduction to a more bitter bar with a higher cacao content.<br />4)These are ample size bars.  I think they would be great for inclusion in a chocolate or coffee gift basket that you might give for the holidays.<br /><br />Ingredients: Cacao beans, sugar, milk, almonds, cocoa butter, nonfat milk, safflower oil, Non-GMO soy lecithin, sea salt, whole vanilla beans.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:  One bar is two servings.  Each serving is 220 calories, has 15 grams of fat, 8 grams of saturated fat, 10 mg. of cholesterol, 80 mg. of sodium, 19 grams carbohydrates, 3 grams of dietary fiber, 16 grams of sugar and 6 grams of protein.<br /><br />This product is gluten-free.

This is fantastic milk chocolate! The almonds are tasty! The sea salt is slightly subdued compared to what I taste in artisan caramels, but the entire thing is just one edible dream!<br />Try it, you'll be hooked for life!

review/summary: Ohhh Chocolatey Goodness..
review/text: This chocolate is so yummy! But even if you are one of my fellow Chocoholics you really can't eat more than half a bar in a sitting, it's just too decadent. If you are new to a chocolate with this much cocoa, it is a light tasting, smooth milk chocolate but the higher cocoa may make it taste just slightly bitter to you. The salted almonds don't come off tasting outright "salty" to your palate, but the salt does enhance the sweetness of this treat. So don't fear the salt!

review/text: This is really good chocolate. The chocolate bar contains almond chunks in just the right amount. The almonds are nicely roasted, and so add a wonderful flavor burst to the bar. The chocolate itself is much richer than typical candy bars, but is not bitter like some dark chocolates. I find that a few chunks from this chocolate bar make a wonderful compliment to a fine cappuccino or espresso. I will definitely be ordering more of these.

review/summary: Quality Chocolate
review/text: I'm not much of a dark chocolate eater, yet most milk chocolate tastes generic, so I tend to stay away from chocolate altogether. The thing that interested me in this chocolate was the 41% cacao because I don't ever see milk chocolate with a percentage (then again I don't usually pay attention). I gave it a try and was surprised that I actually really like it. At first it tasted kind of like dark chocolate but it wasn't bitter or too strong. Before I knew it my first bar was gone and I was on to the next! It is definitely not your average milk chocolate and there is nothing generic about the taste. The almonds were good as well, and as others mentioned you won't actually taste any sea salt. I think I will include this chocolate in my brothers' gift baskets for Christmas. I usually just throw in any fancy looking dark chocolate.

review/summary: Scharffen Berger continues to be my favorite
review/text: I've always preferred Scharffen Berger for baking, and now equally enjoyed the Milk Almond bar for eating straight.  The Scharffen Berger is exceptionally smooth and creamy.  The flavor is full and rich.  The almonds have been roasted, giving an extra layer of flavor.  The salt adds another subtle dimension of flavor, without being "salty".  If you like Hershey's with almonds, you'll almost certainly love the Milk Almond bar.  It is a very high quality product, and delicious.

review/text: I almost never eat milk chocolate because I find it incredibly sweet so I tend to favor dark chocolate. But somehow Scharffen Berger makes milk chocolate taste great. There is no better combination of flavors than chocolate with sea salt, and the addition of little almond bits in this bar does not disappoint! I do wish that the almond bits were almond chunks, though -- the nuts in the bar are plentiful, but I do like bigger pieces in my chocolate. Still, the quality of this chocolate bar is evident in every bite, and is rich enough so that just a little piece is enough to hit the spot when the chocolate cravings hit. Yum!

review/summary: Scharffen is Quality
review/text: I've tried Scharffen chocolate in the past and I know it's a superb chocolate brand. That's why I was surprised that this chocolate bar fell a little flat. The chocolate has a nice smooth milk chocolate taste. There are chopped up bits of almond (which I prefer to whole almonds) but where is the taste of sea salt? I know the almonds are supposed to have the sea salt, but I'm comparing this bar to the World Market version of dark chocolate with sea salt. In the World Market version the taste of sea salt compliments the chocolate and is much more pronounced. So, the Scharffen bar is a nice bar, but needs more of the sea salt taste.

review/text: Good Cocoa taste.  Not too sweet.  I liked the combination of the sea salted almonds.  I always think chocolate and salt is a good combination.  This chocolate bar is not too thick but it is a bit more brittle than one would think a milk chocolate bar would be.  It isn't creamy like a Hershey brand bar.  Be aware however that when you glance at the the calorie content on the label it reads 220 calories...that is for 1/2 of the bar!  I wish it was scored in straight lines in order to break off smaller pieces more easier.  All in all it is a nice treat for around 5 dollars a bar.

It was delicious in sandwiches, though.  I just tried a 1:3 blend of these super-hot seeds with a milder blend, and that's come out very nicely.<br /><br />The dill seeds didn't seem to sprout as fast as the others, though - the rest were happy green sprouts, while the dill had just barely gotten a tiny little root out.  They were edible like that, not too hard to eat or anything, but i would've liked to see them sprout.<br /><br />The dill flavor wasn't terribly strong, but it was a nice note in a very (perhaps too!) tasty blend.

The only thing is the outer shell is a bit harder than the traditional bean, but for someone who is picky it wasn't enough to bother me. It is lower in calories but watch what you eat because it still has carbohydrates just like anything else. I would recommend this product to anyone!

I came back to North America and have had a hard time finding ANY black currant juice, let alone Ribena brand.  This juice is a good value too because it is concentrated, so you only use a little to mix with whatever you are drinking - water, cider, etc - or cooking with it.  Value from this shop is great, actually a little less expensive than the other store I found it at in Canada.  I was pleased with the shipping too, it was fast and well packaged.

I thought it was just an expensive juice when I first bought it, but it was a concentrate to mix with water and that makes it much less expensive. I usually mix it with a slightly carbonated spring water that I keep ice cold in the fridge. Mmmmm. Good. Excellent, as a matter of fact and it's not very high in calories. I might add that my bottle is 600 ml and the bottle listed here is a liter, but otherwise it's the same exact product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

She brought the coffee to make at her job.  Everyone at her job was asking here where she got it.  She received compliments left and right over it.  If you loved coffee and want to try something new go ahead.  I thought it was a tad bit over priced but it isn't like I will buy it everyday.

review/summary: Artificially flavored  tea?
review/text: I purchased this product hoping to get a decent everyday tea.  Well, with Coffee Bean Direct I simply wasted $[...].<br /><br />I tried several Yunnan teas before, including<br />- SerendipiTea Yunnan Supreme ($4.00 / oz)<br />- SerendipiTea Yunnan ($2.15 / oz)<br />- Rishi Tea Organic Golden Yunnan ($2.42 / oz)<br />- Davidson's Tea Bulk, Yunnan Black (budget tea, not currently available at Amazon)<br />- Yunnan 1st Grade Black Tea From SoFo (budget tea, not currently available at Amazon)<br /><br />This tea ($[...] / oz) smells and tastes totally different.<br /><br />When I opened the pack with the tea I felt a very strong smell. Unusually strong. The tea is a blend of (at least) two teas, black and brownish-nude by color. When brewed the tea gets some strong peachy smell and taste. Neither I nor my wife liked this flavor, but like or dislike is a personal thing of course. However, you should not expect an artificial flavoring in any high-quality tea (product is advertised as having "High-quality loose leaf tea leaves").<br /><br />Also product description tells that the product "Contains full tea leaves". This is not true, leaves are broken.  It does not really matters for me, but I'm too disappointed with the product for passing this point.<br /><br />As for the flavored tea, it does not smell/taste as terrible as some other flavored teas I came across do (for example, "Tsar Nikolai" tea that I got in a Russian store). However, the price is too high for the flavored tea.<br />This is my second star.

The ones that did not break are coated with an layer of M&M shell shards from their murdered bagmates. Poor fellas had to watch their poor friends and family shatter then were violently dismembered right in front of them, left only to be covered in the skin and guts of those they love.

It's more expensive (and I don't have to pay for shipping b/c I'm Prime), which is okay with b/c it's hard for me to get to the store and I wanted it fast.  The 1 star rating is b/c 25% of the candy came crushed and left a mess when I opened the bag.  I think that there were melting issues and with the weight, some pieces just cracked.  I will not buy again.

Of course, if you break down and put the whole jar in front of you while the game is on, these comments are not relevant...

review/summary: Misleading Picture and Description
review/text: This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is "russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA".  Notice that this product title starts with "Alaskan Salmon", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of "Grained Salmon Caviar"  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see "made in USA" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was "sorry I was out of town".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.  However there are still inconsistencies with this product's page, that needs to be pointed out.

review/text: As another reviewer has noted, the product description was a bit misleading. I thought I was getting four 7oz jars of Alaskan Salmon Roe. What I received was six small 5oz tins of something purporting to be salmon roe. Most of the writing on the label is in Russian, but it does say "Product of USA." This is all a bit off-putting, as we were planning to give the jars as gifts. Now I guess I'll have to open one one to check things out. The can has a stamp indicating that it was packed only 2 week ago.<br />If the product inside is any good, I'll upgrade this by a star (to 4), if so-so I'll leave it at 3 or maybe 2. If bad, the minimum one star.

review/summary: Delicious source of heart-friendly dark chocolate
review/text: The ingredients of this chocolate bar are listed on the package as: sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter, cocoa processed with alkali, milk fat, lactose (from milk), soy lecithin, PGPR emulsifier, vanillin, artificial flavor, milk. It is 17% fat (a healthy fat from cocoa butter, with no trans fats), 7% carbohydrates and less than 1% protein.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is so named because it contains milk in relatively tiny amounts compared to milk chocolate and somewhat less sugar. As a result of having less milk and sugar, the taste of dark chocolate is more bitter compared to milk chocolate, but it still tastes sweet, especially when sugar is the first ingredient listed on the label as for this candy. Ingredients are listed in the order of quantity of each in the product. Since there is more sugar than any other ingredient in this candy (as in most all candy other than "sugar-free" candy), that's why it tastes sweet. In addition, the juxtaposition of chocolate that is more than usually bitter with the sweetness of sugar makes for a really delicious combination of flavors.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is one of several types of commonly sold chocolate. Unsweetened baking chocolate is quite bitter and consists of cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Milk chocolate is highly sweetened chocolate that contains milk powder or condensed milk. The amount of milk it contains smoothes out the bitterness of the chocolate substantially. White chocolate contains sugar, milk and cocoa butter, but no dark, cocoa solids, and it is not bitter at all.<br /><br />Research has indicated the darker the chocolate the more protective of the heart and cardiovascular system it is. (This brand of chocolate is 60% cocoa, but some brands go as high as 85-87%). In particular, consuming a small bar of dark chocolate, such as one of these, has been shown to reduce blood pressure in people suffering from high blood pressure and to reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol by as much as 10 percent.<br /><br />The reason chocolate is healthy is because it is derived from a plant, the seed of the tropical cacao tree, which contains substances called flavonoids. Flavonoids are antioxidants which protect the body from the damage caused by free radicals. Flavonoids also produce nitric oxide, which lowers blood pressure and balances important hormones in the body.<br /><br />These bars are a good size for a daily "dose" of dark chocolate. However, if you wish to buy a "giant economy size" of this chocolate, it is also sold in 6.8 oz. bars carried by most supermarkets for as little as $2.50. This large size is divided into 8 individual blocks. A serving size is three blocks at 170 calories.

review/text: I'm always looking for a treat that my bulldog can chew that will actually give her some dental benefit to her teeth.  Most of the dental bones I've found she'll swallow in one bite or the break so easily that there's no benefit to her.  These are awesome.  They are hard enough that she actually has to chew them so there's some dental benefit for her (yeah!!) and she seems to like them. It takes her more than two seconds to demolish it, which is always good.<br /><br />As far as the dental benefit, I'm not sure.  I brush her teeth pretty regularly so there is that but I have noticed that her breathe is a little fresher smelling (I'm using the Dingo Dental Mintz too so that may be helping as well).<br /><br />I will buy these again, the dog likes them and they seem to help.

review/text: I've tried a number of different turkish delight brands, and this is one of the best.  The candy is stickier and stretchier than most.  The Bergamot was excellent.  My batch included Lemon/Lime, which was also excellent.  I wish I could buy a batch with just those two flavors.  I would buy this again.

review/summary: makes a homecooked diet simple and great
review/text: I think that this product is wonderful!<br /><br />My dog and cats love the taste of it.  I would never be able to provide the same level of nutrition to my pets by using only my own ingredients.  This enhances the nutrtional level of my pets' meals considerably.  And it is so easy to use.  I often add some fresh vegetables, blueberries, and a very small amount of liver too, instead of just boneless meat or fish, but that's optional because all of those things are already included in Call of the Wild.  All you really have to do is add one teaspoon of Call of the Wild to every 3 ounces of fresh meat, stir it up, and serve. It's that simple to give your pet a fresh food complete and balanced stellar diet.<br /><br />I used to think that the best kibbles like Orijen, Nature's Variety Instinct, etc, were okay for my dog.  Call of the Wild with fresh meat or fish is a far beter diet for my dog.  What a comfort it is to know that my pets are getting the nutrients of a natural diet: raw meats, organs, connective tissues, vitamins, minerals, fruits, vegetables, fiber, fats, antioxidents etc. -- about everthing that they'd get from eating natural prey and other natural foods.  And this is not expensive.  It's very convenient and uncomplicated.<br /><br />I use Call of the Wild for most of the pets' meals (and sometimes I also feed Stella and Chewey's freeze dried raw.)<br /><br />My dog devours the homecooked meats with this stuff on it. I would not be able to provide the same level of nutriton without this product.<br /><br />I very highly recommend this product for homecooked pet meals.<br /><br />You should also get a food scale to weigh the meat, so you can add the correct amount of Call of the Wild.  Use measuring spoons, too.  The only other thing you need is fish oil with natural vitamin E for days that you don't feed sardines or wild salmon.<br /><br />I cannot see myself ever going back to feeding kibble again, not even the best of them like Orijen or Nature's Variety Instinct that I used for a long time.  I am very convinced that fresh meat with Call of the Wild + occasional Stella and Chewy's freeze dried raw meals is a far better diet for my dog than when I fed the best grain free kibbles.<br /><br />It's worked out great for feeding my two cats and extraordinarily active German Shepherd dog.

review/summary: Crunchy, Tasty and Low In Calories.
review/text: My wife and I are always struggling to control our weight. We could stand to lose 10 (my wife) to 20 (me) pounds and we're always working at it. We try to eat a proper diet and we watch our fats and sugars and we try to get our exercise in, but life is so complex and we have so little time. Alas, following some strict regimen is difficult in itself and we need a reward, even a little reward, from time to time. My wife likes to have a small treat with her tea after a meal, for example. Well, most treats tend to be calorie dense or not much of a treat. She has come up with a variety of solutions and her latest is Kellogg Special K Fruit Crisps.<br /><br />Fruit Crisps come in a packet of two and the whole packet only amounts to 100 calories. We can open a packet after dinner, each have a little desert, and only ingest 50 extra calories. How harmful can that be? The Fruit Crisps are crunchy and tasty and come in several varieties. They have a slight coating of vanilla stripes. The total list of ingredients is long, and I tend to exclude such items, but again, it's only a little treat. Have a heart! Of course, you'd have to resist eating the whole box, but we've maintained control at only one packet per meal and we don't have them after every meal. So far, it's working rather well.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I find I have grown somewhat addicted to having one of these crisps every morning with my coffee - they're not terribly filling because the crisps are relatively thin, but if like me you just need a little something to munch on in the morning these are the perfect pick.  Easy to grab and go, delicious, crunchy, all that you could look for in the morning.  Nice to buy them on sale or in bulk because they can be expensive.<br /><br />I like both fruit flavors of this product, but not as much the chocolate or cinnamon flavors.  I'm hoping they'll introduce more fruit flavors in the future.

review/summary: C'mon people, these are just TINY Pop Tarts at 3 TIMES the $$$
review/text: Go buy a box of (strawberry - blueberry) Pop Tarts. In each box you'll have eight "pastries". Four packs of two. Take out a single pastry and cut it in half, any way you prefer. Now you're holding a the same EXACT SIZE AND QUANTITY of "snack" as one package of two... of the Special K Fruit Crisps.<br /><br />Go ahead... take a bite. Take your time... I can wait. Now have a bite of this "healthy" fruit crisp. Which tastes better? OR better still... is there really much difference AT ALL? (Frankly... toast the Pop Tart and then do the taste comparison.)<br /><br />Ounce for ounce, you get the same calories and virtually identical nutrition (check for yourself).<br /><br />Do they taste good? Sure, but wow... unless you consider a Pop Tart to be healthy (most people do not) quit fooling yourself. I have nothing against these, other than the premise under which they're sold and bought.<br /><br />Virtually anything tiny is low calorie... so let's start packaging tiny cubes of brownies and talk about how delicious, healthy, and low calorie they are... and sell 'em for about three times the price (per ounce) than the normal size brownies from the same company.<br /><br />Really? *sigh* Ooookaaaay.

review/summary: great beer, sketchy seller
review/text: I could regale you with a glowing review of the product itself. Maine Root is, by far, the best root beer I have ever tasted. I found it a few years ago at a local Whole Food and was instantly hooked. It is a sublime, well-rounded brew which clearly shows the great care and artistry of it's maker. It is definitely a FIVE-STAR beverage, unsurpassed in its glory.<br /><br />However, I would think twice before ordering it from Nutricity, who resells it through Amazon. From their review status here, one would think they are a decent seller, but if you do a little research, like on Reseller Ratings.com,  you will find they have a reputation for unreliable service, delivery and refunds. Some reviews have accused them of selling opened or expired items, even sending the wrong item and then refusing to refund the cost or giving customers the call-back runaround. At the time of this review, they are the only option via Amazon.<br /><br />On top of all this, you can actually buy this product for a couple bucks cheaper, including shipping charges, directly from the brewer on their website. Then you are guaranteed fresh product and timely delivery. I can personally attest to their quick response to customer issues (just a couple hours for me). If you can't find Maine Root locally yet, buying it through Amazon is definitely not your best option. Go directly to the source, if nothing else.<br /><br />P.S.-You can also contact the brewer on their site to check if it is available at your local stores. Whole Food no longer carries it where I live, but I have purchased it at a local Wegman's for far less than this price ($40.00 + tax-for the same quantity) due to the wholesale discounts they must receive.

Maine has that great (but not sickening) licorice flavor, vanilla, wintergreen, nutmeg, heavy draft, sweet but not overly sweet (using evaporated cane juice instead of any type of disgusting corn syrup) and a great bite that's natural tasting and not at all cheap/synthetic with a satisfying delicious taste that I can't find anywhere else.

When I think of Diamond slivered almonds, I think of this recipe my sister-in-law Sue gave me to include in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook<br /><br />Sue's Rice Ravishing<br /><br />Ingredients<br />1 pound sausage<br />1 large onion, chopped<br />1 large green pepper, chopped<br />1 stalk celery, chopped<br />1� cups hot water<br />2 envelopes chicken noodle soup<br />� cup raw rice<br />Slivered almonds<br />Paprika or parsley<br />  Procedure<br />Brown sausage, onion, pepper, and celery. Cook soup and rice in boiling water. Combine all ingredients in 2-quart casserole. Top with almonds. Bake 10 minutes in hot oven. Sprinkle with paprika or parsley.<br /><br />One of the great things about Diamond products is the gaurantee on the bag: "If this prodcut is not to your satisfaction, please send comments, empty package, and your name and address to Diamond Foods, Inc."<br /><br />Something to be cautious about is allergies.  Many people are allergic to almonds. Diamond allegy information is that the company processes this product on equipment that also processes "other tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy, milk, and sesame seeds."<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.

review/summary: Australia's healthiest export
review/text: Vegemite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O10K6C">Vegemite 400g Jar</a>is practically unknown in North America, but I'll bet there is no one is Australia of an ethnicity who has never heard of Vegemite, and of those who have, almost everyone will have some at home. Every restaurant and side of the road eatery carries it. It comes in tubes, jars, and little packets like jams and butter substitutes do in the US. It is Vegemite, the concentrated yeast extract spread that goes on most slices of bread or toast Down Under. Dark brown to be almost black, it has a strong taste, so if you're a novice, spread it thin. Americans who try Vegemite fall into two categories: those who hate it or love it immediately. Don't take my word for it, check it out online: there is no better sourse for B vitamins than Vegemite. If your are used to nothing other than peanut butter and jam on your bread and toast, you are ready for a change, a change for a low-calorie healthy product that you won't be able to stop talking about. It's flavour is unique; it's closest cousin is the British and New Zealand Marmite, though similar, is not the same. Ordering it in the US is more expensive than getting it Oz, but it is a sacrifce that I am happy  to make just to have it on the table.

review/summary: A fave breakfast spread for my husband!
review/text: After looking around at specialty stores in my locale, I realized that I could buy Vegemite for less through Amazon's food distribution.  I bought 2 jars for my husband, for Hanukkah - he was thrilled!  Next best thing to returning to Australia & bringing some back in our luggage!  Wish Amazon carried the larger sized jar!

review/summary: I just adore my Vegemite!
review/text: I was a little leery about trying Vegemite...it has such bad press outside of Australia, but I find I absolutely love it.  It is extremely salty, slightly beerish and very savoury.  So far I have mostly consumed it with bread and butter...but I have already started taking tastes straight from the jar.  I also find I like it better with whole wheat bread than white.<br /><br />I think the main challenge for the uninitiated is that it looks like it might be sweet.  It is not sweet at all and you should use it very sparingly mixed with plenty of butter, at least at first.<br /><br />Sadly, my husband also likes it and my supply is dwindling rapidly.  I wish they sold it in a larger size.

review/summary: Call me a convert
review/text: I was frightened by my breakfast today. Vegemite on buttered toast. Yes, I had researched the traditional way to eat it. But still... I was scared. I faced my fear. I opened the jar. I stared down the thick, dark, brown, gooey goo. I took a spoon and took control. I spooned out a tiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnny bit. Tiny. I put it on the edge of my toast. I made a face. I took a bite. I smiled. In dismay. In pleasure. I picked up the spoon again and commanded the brown goo to give me more more more. Well, still sparingly, but, nevertheless... more. I used no more than 1/2 teaspoon on my slice of toast. I had a second slice with another almost 1/2 teaspoon. I updated my Facebook status. People replied in curiosity, in fellowship or in disgust. Or all of the above. About an hour later I craved it again, and I indulged again. Between waking and dinnertime, three slices with that just-less-than-one-half-teaspoonful of Vegemite was all I consumed, and, I swear, I was pleasantly satiated all day and full of energy. Can't wait until breakfast tomorrow! :) (Standard disclaimer: I've been vegetarian for almost 18 years. This had an almost beefy taste. Salty, beefy, vegan, lots of B vitamins. Yum.)

review/summary: For Aussies and die-hard Aussie-Fans
review/text: So apparently Australians spread Vegemite on their bread slices. The Germans think it's Nutella before realizing that it is FAR from it. I would never put it on my bread because you have to grow up with it to LOVE it. I have put it on a hard-boilt egg and then it's quite pleasant. I gave it 5 stars because everybody should get a jar and let their friends taste it for the fun of it. It's a yeast spread and it tastes very salty.

review/summary: Vegemite is Vegemite - exempt from review :)
review/text: Okay so I only just thought to put Vegemite in the amazon search box - and found I could buy it. I have to say, as an Aussie I think it is hilarious to be reviewing Vegemite...:) I mean it is not like they are going to change it - maybe they will add it to a few more things like they have to cheese slices, crackers (aka bikkies etc). But we would revolt!!! Vegemite is vegemite (and we are Happy Little Vegemites) so, I mean sorry to all the Americans who keel over dead at the taste...So I think people can review for entertainment purposes only. I mean my friend thinks it is something they scrape out of beer barrels (he he). I am just glad there is another place to replenish in case of emergencies. Go Aussie Go!!

review/summary: Makes me feel so good
review/text: Thanks Mate.  Boy thoes Aussies really know what they are doing when it comes to digestion.  No more heartburn or indigestion, I sleep like a baby.  Another product from amazon that they will have to pry out of my cold dead hands. I give it too my husband, dog, grown children, grown grands and baby greatgrands.  Good for everybody.  I take it right off of the spoon in a little ball about 1/4 teaspoon full and wash it down with Organic Milk from amazon of course.  I don't understand how anyone can live without shopping on amazon especially with the messed up economy.

review/summary: Highly addictive!
review/text: I picked up the taste for Vegemite while living in Australia for school.  When I came home to the US, it was VERY hard to find, and I tried to supplement Marmite for my vegemite addiction.  Although Marmite is yummy, too, it is not Vegemite.  I was so excited to find it in a local store here in the States, and I've been keeping a good stock ever since.<br /><br />It is definitely an acquired taste, but once you've acquired it, you are hooked for life!  I keep a few jars in my pantry at all times, and buy a new jar when I finish one, so there's always several jars available in case of another "Vegemite shortage" in the US.  Sounds weird, but it's really THAT addictive!  ;  My husband thought I was crazy over my vegemite obsession and refused to even try it because he didn't like the smell, but I finally got him to give it a go, and now he's hooked, too.<br /><br />If you like salty foods, it's worth trying.  You may want one of the little 150 gram jars for your first Vegemite experience, as rumor has it that most Americans don't like it at all.  It's definitely worth trying, though, and if you don't like it on your toast (or my fave -- on apple slices), you can add it to soups and stews to give them a "meaty" flavor.  We also love it as "Vegemite Spaghetti" -- a quick, tasty and easy meal (recipe is online).<br /><br />I'm so glad it's available in Amazon.  My household could not live without it!  We are happy little Vegemites!<br /><br />And as a bonus, I was told in Australia that liking Vegemite makes you an honorary Australian.  ;)
