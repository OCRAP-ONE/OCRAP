review/summary: Verrrrrrrry tasty!
review/text: This Campbell's Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo is one surprising meal to find just from opening a can (easy opener, too). Spicy (but not too much to annoy my sensitive stomach), interesting, but not too filling. Good idea to have something else along with this; at least some bread or hot bun. The whole can yields hardly 15 grams of protein which is about 1/3 of your minimum needs. The sodium (table salt) amount is about 70% of your daily needs. A lot from just one meal (too much for some people with high blood pressure).<br /><br />But if you are a calorie watcher it is good news: the entire can is only 300 calories. And, as mentioned, it tastes fantastic. I may buy a couple more cases of this. It makes a quick, enjoyable lunch experience. Take it to work in a thermos flask. Canned soups and stews have improved over the years and this is an excellent example.<br /><br />If you NEED lots of calories and protein in a canned stew, try some of the beef stews Campbells sells; they're not as tasty, though!

review/summary: good soup, better prices than super stop & shop
review/text: I like this soup a lot. It's not as good as real gumbo, but it is good for a canned soup. The cost per can is less than what you'd pay at a super stop & shop, so if you eat it often, get it here than there.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: The flavor of this soup varies somewhat from from batch to batch, and I feel that overall, it is not as good as when it was first introduced. I still eat it several times a week though.  CAUTION!!  Do not get the "Health Request" variety thinking it has the same good taste... it is poor by comparison.

review/text: We just had these for lunch today.  I've had sardines before.  I love fish, but I've never much liked sardines because my mother always bought the cans w/the sardines in brines.  However, I bought these from an Asian store and we cooked them today and these are AWESOME.  I could've easily eaten the whole can myself.  I'm eating them right now, cold, not even heated, and they're still delicious!  I'll never buy any other brand of sardines ever again.

review/summary: Great baklava for holiday parties or as a gift
review/text: This baklava is delicious! Had it around Christmas time last year and didn't find the batch to be excessively oily or low quality at all. It has a pinch of ground pistachio on the top which is a nice touch for your taste buds. I'm not a big fan of the sweets so this was perfect for my tastes. My mom even had me order two as holiday gifts (ordered a day after Christmas) and they arrived a week later.

I expected GINGER PEOPLE ORIGINAL GINGER CHEWS, long rectangles w/ the fine powdered sugar INDIVIDUALLY wrapped in the green wrappers, (gee, just like the picture, imagine that!).<br />Instead what I received was a clear bag w/ a generic homemade typed up label. Inside are square candies with coarse sugar crystals on them. What a mess! I live in TX, this is going to clump up into one giant piece of candied ginger. I wanted the INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED ones LIKE IN THE PICTURE to have in my purse. I'm looking into returning this mess!

review/text: I ordered this one pound bag in hopes I would get a one pound bag of individually wrapped candies, as the photo in the description shows.  The Individual candies are usually soft, and chewy, with a light fine dusting of suger.  The item I received was a one pound bag of candied ginger.  Crystalized suger coating not the soft chewy spicy candy I expected, but Crystalized Ginger one might find around the holidays.  I like it too, but it is not what I ordered.  The photo is misleading.  I instead ordered a 4 ounce box of individually wrapped chews, and will use this bag of Crystalized Ginger for recipes.

review/text: I am very familiar with the multiple Bottarga products available in the U.S. and I ordered this one from Chefshop as I am well aware of this particular brand's quality.  This Bottarga costs almost twice as much as the one available from Chef'sWarehouse, but since I wanted the best quality I spent the extra money on this .  I did not receive this exact product. I received an unbranded product that is probably the smallest 4 oz piece of Bottarga I have ever seen as well. I weighed it at 3.3oz . I wont be being from them again.

review/summary: Love the Bottle Caps - Hate the Mess
review/text: There are nothing wrong with the actually bottle caps.  It's the boxes they come in that are the problem.  This is not an amazon packing issue, it's truly just the way the boxes are.  Sugary powder/dust leaks out of almost every box (in fact, when you open the shipping box they arrive in, you'll probably see a nice coat of it in there amongst the careful packaging).  It will get on your clothes.  It will get everywhere.  I had planned on giving these boxes out, but I didn't because they were just a mess.  Instead, I wound up opening the boxes up and dumping the candy into a big ziploc bag.  Tasty bottle caps though!

review/summary: Package was torn open when I received it
review/text: This is more a review on the packaging, than the product.  When this was received the edge of the wrapper was torn along the top of the Reese's cup (keep in mind each cup is 1/2 a pound so they are large).  I think that this was due being delivered in an envelope and not a box. There was not adequate protection and when anything came into contact with the envelope it also came into contact with the product inside and therefore tore the package along the top edge of the Reese's cup.  I have requested a return label and I was told I would not be charged for the return, so at least that is one positive aspect of this situation.

Even if I were not celiac, I'd have my pantry stocked with these crackers.  I live in hurricane country so I want my pantry stocked well with nutritious food in case of emergency.  Mary's sure are nutritious, delicious and way more convenient than dehydrating my own raw crackers which I'm not always up for preparing.  Bravo, Mary!

review/summary: Great crunch, not so great flavor!
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying that most of my friends see me as the original "health nut." And it's true. I shop mainly at health food stores for my groceries and eat the kind of foods that would make most people raise an eyebrow or two. So my tastes run a little different from the average American's.<br /><br />But even I think that these Mary's Gone Crackers Herb flavored crackers taste terrible. The flavor of rosemary is just far too overpowering to be enjoyable for me.<br /><br />Having said that, I greatly appreciate the other fine qualities of this cracker-- crispy, satisfying, holds onto dips quite well. Oh, and it's ridiculously healthy, too.<br /><br />So I'll try the other flavors and see how it goes. But unless you *love* the flavor of rosemary, I'd steer clear of this particular flavor.

review/summary: great GF cracker!
review/text: This cracker is crunchy, has a great texture, crunch, and flavor. The herbs are just right, not too overpowering. These crackers are great all by themselves. They also go great with cheese slices or dips. I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty these crackers were. No burnt taste or anything bad as other reviewers had described. Give them a try. I would take these over my old favorite town house crackers any day!

review/summary: Healthy AND Tasty
review/text: Many of my family members can not tolerate gluten so while visiting one of them, I tried these crackers. I really like them. No, they don't taste like a Ritz(tm), but that is not the flavor I am after anyway. When I read the label, I know what all the ingredients are. The herb flavor is not strong. Even after the package is open for weeks, they still taste fresh. If I made my own crackers, this is what they would taste like.

review/text: I just love these crackers.. I buy 4 and 5 boxes at a time from the market! I must admit though, they're an acquired taste!  The first box I bought, I hated!! I tasted, they sat, and I tossed. Why I ever ventured and bought them again, I'm not sure, but I'm glad I did because I can't live without them now.  They aren't ordinary crackers, but once you acquire the taste, you're hooked. They're addictive and you can't get enough.  As a gluten-free celiac, these are my go-to. I eat them with cream cheese, chicken-salad, as chips, with hummus, etc.  They're GREAT!

review/summary: Feel good snack taste-wise, and health-wise
review/text: I love potato chips, it is simple, tasty, crunchy; a mass produced cracker doesn't stand a chance, not to mention a healthy cracker. Embraced healthy food lifestyle for many years now, and had fare share of disappointment when it came to healthy snacking. After many years I ended up with a handful of healthy snacks that not only are healthy, but very tasty. Mary's  Gone Crackers made the cut the very moment I tried one. I can easily put down a chip for these.<br /><br />TASTE = very nutty-rice-sesame hearty in flavor with a texture sort of like a glazed chinese cracker. Delicious indeed<br /><br />When it comes to healthy,its no brainier!<br />Ingredients<br />a. Brown rice = vitamin B1, vitamin B3, and iron<br />b. Quinoa  = dietary fiber, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, calcium, and thus is useful for vegans and those who are lactose intolerant<br />c. Flax seed  = Omega3<br />d. Sesame  = Omega6,antioxidants(sesamin, sesamolin, and sesamol, protein<br />Rest are organic fillers and hebs.<br />  @VS@<br />!!Mass produced crackers have crap like:<br />CULTURED MILK, SALT, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED COTTONSEED OIL, SALT, AUTOLYZED YEAST EXTRACT, MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATECALCIUM PHOSPHATE, ANNATTO EXTRACT (VEGETABLE COLOR), SODIUM CASEINATE, LACTIC ACID, ACETIC ACID, WHEY (list goes on)<br /><br />Conclusion, if you are a guy looking for a hearty, tasty, flavorful healthy alternative to chips this will fill in that void...<br />Why 4 rating and not 5? Its expensive, and doesn't replicate a fresh home made variations.

I tested negative for gluten intolerance but I'm trying to eat healthier. Can't believe I found something that satisfies my snack cravings and has such healthy ingredients in it. I really don't care for the onion flavor (that's the only other flavor I've tried so far) but the herb flavor is so good I think I bought most of the boxes at my local Natural Grocer's store lol.

review/text: I recently bought these crackers to go along with a soup I had for lunch.  Being fairly new to the whole GF scene I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I didn't expect the crackers to be as bad as they were.  The taste was simply awful - I can't quite place the taste other than to say that there were burnt undertones and a TON of rosemary.  I was glad to have salami to put on top of the crackers to mask their taste.  I will definitely not be buying these again.

review/text: I am usually the one in the group to try healthy new foods. I tried these crackers and agree with other reviewers:  the taste of Rosemary is VERY overpowering. I'm not sure if there is also Fennel in these, but the aftertaste leads me to think so.  Great crunch to them, though.  Not to my taste, but perhaps to others' taste.  These are not cheap, so if you can find a way to sample before you buy, DO IT!

review/summary: was really loking forward to a good cracker...
review/text: WEll...this product isnt that. IT is cruchy like a chip, we are used to that, but the herb is SOOOO STRONGGG, It might be good to stuff turkey with or something, I would still be afraid it would be overwhelming. I tired adding cheese to it I used it in a meatloaf, had to throw it away, not 1 in my family could eat it!!  Maybe a plain cracker from this produt would be good, it didnt fall apart when you bit into it, which is always good...lol, But for me anyway, the herb flavor was wayyyyy toooo muchhh, and I love herb flavoring, I have lemon and herb on my chicken all the time, 1 of my favorite meals.<br />But I do have a girlfriend that is gluten intolerant also, and she thinks they are great. SO you might want to go to a site where you can get it as just 1 box instead of a case if you decide to try it.<br />hope this helps someone.<br />Have a GREAT day!<br />Cindy

review/text: Inko's apricot tea is, by far, one of the best teas (of any flavor) I've ever tasted.  It's not too overwhelmingly fruity, but there's a nice hint of apricot, which I like just fine.  I wish the shipping charges were lower, but after all, these are glass bottles.  If you can't find it at your local grocery store, it just may be worth it.  You definitely won't be disappointed with the quality of the tea!

review/summary: Yummy but watch out...
review/text: Absolute fantastic aroma, great taste with a good balance of vanilla and rich coffee.  I only gave it 4 stars because (and this is the "watch out" part) it seems to upset my delicate acid reflux.  I was so craving vanilla coffee, and lately have only been able to drink low acid decaf coffee, and only very very rarely (a few times a year).  I decided to chance it on this, and loved the flavor so much I drank a few cups.  However, on the very first drink my acid reflux was IMMEDIATELY a mess.  I was only able to make one small pot, I tried it again a month later (because yes, it was that good) and ended up giving it away.  If you don't have that problem, enjoy this coffee.  It's really a five star coffee, I just couldn't give it 5 stars.

review/text: I bought this because I saw something similar on Iron Chef.  You can serve food on it and wipe it with a damp rag for reuse.  This shape isn't as usefull as the 8"x8"x1" but it's still pretty cool.  I figure that I'll use them (as in 6 bricks) for a while as serving plates and the recycle them in my mortar and pestle.  I've purchased rough-chopped pink salt for more than the per pound price of these bricks.  This salt compliments foods like Sushi or Sashimi.  I put this in the nice-to-have category.  If you have a few dollars extar to spend than get rid of that iodized (cyanide) table salt and switch over to 100% sea salt.  If you eat anything that isn't 100% home made, chances are you get enough iodine in prepared foods.  Do some research and see how conventional table salt in mined using presurized potassium cyanide - yummy.

review/summary: LOVE the Convenience (but not the cost!)
review/text: My daughter was on Nutramigen for her entire first year but not by my choice.  She, unfortunately, was a victim of quacks and landed in the NICU for the first month of her life. Her NICU stay wasn't much better because of some lazy nurses (and I can judge because I am a nurse myself) They were feeding her regular Enfamil at first but switched her to Nutramigen because of stomach "issues" (the issue was they were stuffing her with about a cup of formula per feed 6-8 times a day!) They actually distended her stomach! When she got home she could not tolerate any other formulas so I just stuck with Nutramigen. (Sorry, just had to vent!)<br />Anyway, I started out using the powder which was OK but I always had a problem with clumping and clogging the nipple which would then cause my daughter to scream at the bottle.  Aside from the inconvenience, it was only good for 24 hours.  Plus, in my research, I found out that almost all baby tragedies regarding any formula had to do with powders not liquids.  Yes, buying the liquid is more costly, but Nutramigen is expensive anyway so what's a few more bucks especially when child safety is concerned.  It was roughly an extra 2 bucks a day.<br />The liquids are pasteurized and good for 48 hours which is a big timesaver.  I have used the 13oz concentrate liquid, 32oz RTU can, 2oz plastic nursettes, the 6oz glass nursettes (LOVED those) and the 8oz concentrate in plastic bottles(more on those later...Boo!).<br /><br />When Enfamil came out with these 8oz RTU bottles, I immediately bought them.  The individual bottles are convenient and don't take up much room.  They are all foil sealed, cap-locked and boxed to protect from light.  They have a fairly long shelf life so you can stock up (NB: if you order directly from Enfamil, as I did, the expiration was always 3-6months from the purchase date. I can not speak for other vendors.) When you do open them, you never have to worry about waste because of the small size.  In the rare event that you do waste it's only a few ounces not an entire can.  The 6 pack case was also helpful when I needed to leave some at grandma's house.<br /><br />Incidentally, a caution regarding the 8oz concentrate bottles.  I purchased the concentrate bottles at the same time as the RTU, however I noticed that the concentrate formula had these gray-black floaters in it which I never saw in other liquid versions of Nutramigen.  Even after shaking well they still remained. I immediately called Enfamil to express my concern and they sent me a new case. This case had the same problem so, out of curiosity, I mixed it up and tried it.  Although, it tasted and smelled like Nutramigen (which is God awful BTW, akin to asparagus and metal bathed in dirty feet) I was still concerned and did not give to my daughter. I asked them to replace the order with glass nursettes.  In retrospect, my suspicion is that the floaters are iron particles that do not disperse well in the fat(like oil and vinegar) and thus are harmless, however I would still be wary.  It is possible that Enfamil has addressed this issue since my purchase several months ago but I would stick to the ready to use formulas or 13oz concentrate cans.

I have been using the 32oz RTF cans ever since but the only place I could get them was babies r us 20 miles away! Ugh! I just discovered these 8 oz ready to feed bottles and bought a bunch of them. They are a little more expensive but they are so easy to take on the go!! I bought them from the enfamil site, not amazon. Then I went to babies r us and they had them too ( they never have before).

review/summary: Perfect Honeybush Herbal Tea
review/text: *****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Bushmen's Brew Honeybush Herbal Teasan is a premium Numi herbal tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified honeybush. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "For hundreds of years, the Khoi and San peoples of Southern Africa hand gathered this plant from the mountainous regions of their homelands. This honey scented flowering bush creates an enticing rich brew with sweet honey over-tones. Rich in anti-oxidants, phytoestrogens and essential minerals, this new, organic African herbal is both delicious and healthy. One sip and the secret touches your soul." It is naturally sweet (but not too sweet) and delicious.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love herbal teas or honeybush in particular, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: A touch of...swampgrass?
review/text: Although food items are difficult to rate in a five-star system because personal taste can vary so much, here I go: This honeybush tea is probably of fine quality (steeped to a good color, aromatic enough), but I find the "honey" nomer misleading -- "wet hay" is rather my take, with some honey and lots of jasmine in the nose and an edge of something wheaty.  My sinuses feel filled with florals, and my mouth empty of honey: not what I was looking for.  May you have better.

review/summary: The best herbal tea and chock full of minerals, to boot.
review/text: I've been very disappointed in most herbal teas, finding most of them rather thinly flavored or flavored with licorice root, which makes me gag.  So I was delighted to find this robustly-flavored herbal tea that tastes great alone, with sugar or honey, with lemon, or with mulling spices. It's superb with mulling spices and then chilled.  At any rate, Bushmen's HoneyBush Brew is now a staple of my diet, especially since reading that it provides a number of needed trace minerals.

I've found there to be no bitter aftertaste as some have complained about.  Was really happy to find such a bargain price at Amazon could not beat this price anywhere I searched.  If you want pure Stevia than you have to get Stevia without any fillers.  I am satisfied with Pure Via.

review/summary: PureVia All Natural Zero Calorie Sweetener
review/text: Sugar is very useful, definitely needed in making certain food products, and has it's place, and boy do I enjoy the natural pleasure of eating sweets and dessert now and then, but I try not to consume too much of it for the obvious health reasons and have been buying stevia, a good all natural sugar substitute for quite a while now, purchasing it in liquid form.  I recently discovered PureVia two or three months ago in the grocery department of a local chain store and purchased it to give it a try, hoping this brand, and powder version of stevia would measure up.  I was satisfied with its effectiveness to sweeten my coffee, various teas and cereal and also with the convenient individual packets, and have been buying the 80-count box ever since.  When I ran out of it this last time I checked online for availability and was very pleased to find the same PureVia brand available on Amazon.com., where I found it available in an 800-count box which should not only last me (theoretically) ten times longer than my usual 80-count box but at a price that actually saved me between $15 and $16 bucks! ... pleasing THIS life-long bargain hunter BIG TIME.<br /><br />Re shipping:  I believe it was delivered a day or so later than the estimated ETA but I think it was delayed because it was delivered with the shipping box a bit damaged.  One end of the box was slightly crushed and had been re-taped due to conspicuous insufficient interior packing paper inside the shipping box.  Fortunately, PureVia's product box was completely intact and not damaged in any way.<br /><br />So aside from a small delivery annoyance, this was obviously a very good buy.  Lucky me.

review/summary: Good Product
review/text: I have been using splenda for a very long time, maybe 15 years?  After reading so many bad things about refined sugar, I started cutting back a long time ago, mostly in coffee and tea. I also switched to diet drinks for the same reason. But then I started reading bad things about artificial sweeteners too. Apparently, your body reacts in a similar way to many artificial sweeteners as it does to pure glucose, messing with your insulin sensitivity. I don't have diabetes but my blood sugar is higher than I would like so I am trying to prevent it from getting worse. I totally cut out diet soda and I've been using PureVia for about a year now and it seems to work fine for me, no bad effects. Huge variation in price, the 800 packet box is the best deal I've found.

review/summary: YUCK!!!
review/text: I personally purchase a lot of the 100 Calorie Snacks or the Rite Bite Snacks. I was excited to see a "cheesecake" bar in the 100 Calorie Section. However, I could NOT find these in any store near me! So, I ordered these & anxiously awaited their arrival...only to be VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! These bars are super dry, almost impossible to eat without a drink nearby. They do not taste anything like cheesecake. Even the graham cracker (Honey Maid) that is underneath the "cheesecake" is unbelievably dry & tasteless, almost like eating sawdust! Their is no "moisture" to the "cheesecake" layer what-so-ever, and it is grainy & gritty. I would not recommend these to anyone!!! If you really want some cheesecake & are on a diet, I say save up some calories for the end of your week & treat yourself to a piece of the real stuff, because you will be sorely disappointed with these bars! I only opened one of them, and made myself finish it because I cannot stand wasting food, it was a challenge to eat every bite!

review/summary: Great little bite of cheesecake
review/text: I just discovered these great little bars and now the store cannot get them anymore. So disappointing!  I can't say they are the best thing out there but for being a 100 calorie bar they are pretty good.  Obviously they are not going to taste like good cheesecake because 1)they are not refrigerated, 2) they are 100 calorie and good cheesecake is probably 1,000 calories a slice! and 3) they are plain instead of flavored like turtle or strawberry.  I did not find them to be grainy or dry but a soft, chewy bar.  I like to eat one along with a strawberry cheesecake yogurt, yum! All in all I think they are good but I would not pay more for them than the average granola type bar.

review/summary: Overly Sweet; Very Little Flavor
review/text: I was so excited for a cheesecake flavor when I saw it, but these were disappointing. The bars are super sickly sweet with a weird chemically fake vanilla-ish undertaste.  Absolutely NO cheesecake or cream cheese type flavor and even the graham layer is just sweet without any real graham cracker taste.  The overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy -- not at all creamy.  Sizewise they are smallish, but pretty standard for any of the many 100 calorie-ish snack pack foods.  Similar in price as most granola and snack bars, none of which are ever much of a good value.  Overall, while they aren't inedible or anything, I would not buy these again and I don't even think I'll bother with the rest of the box.

I was thrilled when Amazon put it on Subscribe and Save. My biggest cat will stretch herself across the threshold of a room and bite my legs if her bowl is empty of this food. Mind you, I keep three large bowls of three different types of food for them, but she only bites when out of this food. I have no idea what delight is in this container, but my furry girls only beg for this food (and my cooked food)! Amazon's price is by far cheaper than Walmart, CVS, KMart, or Public, so this is nice too. However, I would buy it whatever the price. According to the reaction from "the ladies," this is the only dry food to buy.

review/text: My daughter and I both have Celiac Disease. Our entire household is gluten free. Sillys and non sillys all eat the same. We all really enjoy this pasta. We don't think it has a corny (sorry about the pun) flavor at all. It holds up really well and reheats pretty well too. As with all gluten free pastas you are better off not boiling this pasta. I bring the water to a boil and drop in the pasta, cover the pot and bring back to a boil. Turn off the heat and let the pasta sit about 8-10 minutes stirring every couple of minutes. Then I drain and toss with butter. Perfect every time. I would look in your local heathfood store for a bag or two to be sure you like it just as much as we do, before you buy 12 bags.

My suggestion is to taste the pasta after 9 minutes to check on the degree of chewiness.<br />I have prepared a total of 2 packages now. I stir the pasta more often than wheat pasta, because of the reviews warning about the pasta sticking together. However, I have not seen any tendency for this corn pasta to stick together. My entire family loves the pasta and the price is right. I have subscribed to the automatic 6-monthly delivery which deducted 15% off the price. Taste and texture like ordinary wheat pasta!<br />FYI, this pasta is imported from Romania.
