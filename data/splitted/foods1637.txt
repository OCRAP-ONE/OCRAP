review/summary: Good food, easy delivery
review/text: I have two small-ish dogs (both should weigh about 12-15 pounds each), who are 9 and 11 years old. Feeding them never used to be an issue; we used a nice quality dry food, and they ate out of one bowl together. A few years ago, though, one of them became dangerously ill, and is now diabetic with heavy cataracts in both eyes, so being sure she gets enough to eat at the right times has become much more important. I mix a quarter of a can with a half cup of our dry dog food for each dog twice a day. This gives both of them the right calories (the other dog is more plump because when food falls, she is the only one who can see it!), and the wet food ensures that my diabetic pup eats everything in her bowl. Amazon's price is better than what I pay locally, and it arrives sooner than what the delivery-by date is.

review/summary: My pup's favorite brand of canned food
review/text: My pup, a corgi/chi mix who rarely gets people food yet somehow is so very picky, LOVES weruva. He has tried other very high quality brands and has now been turning his nose up to those after he has tried this. He has so far tried and loved the paw-lickin chicken, grandma's chicken soup, and wok the dog.  These are especially great if you like to have something to mix in with kibble because they have a good amount of sauce in it, though not too much in my opinion to feel like you're getting jipped.<br /><br />I have not yet purchased them from amazon so I cannot comment on the shipping quality.  Although I have bought online elsewhere and it arrived via fedex, some a little dented but all cans still useable.  Glad to see weruva is on amazon, will have to order from here next time I need to purchase.

review/summary: Excellent quality.  My dogs LOVE it!  =)
review/text: My Cavaliers absolutely love this product.  I give it to my nursing moms to keep weight on them.  Some of them tend to get picky when they're nursing, but this brand of food is always more than appreciated by my little mamas.  :) I would like to explain just a bit further.  My largest expense with my show dogs is for their top quality food, even more costly than our vet expenses!  If my spoiled fur family loves this food, I, for one, am convinced it's a top-notch product. I wish it were cheaper, but all things considered, it's an acceptable price for the quality.

review/text: Solay Gourmet Himalayan Sea Salt and Celtic Salt Soft Vanilla Caramels are without a doubt the most incredible, creamy caramel I have ever eaten.  I love the added crunch of the sea salt and have tried numerous brands, all ranging from pricey to more pricier.  These are worth every cent and are the best I have had.  This will be the second time I have ordered the caramels and will continue to do so.  I limit myself to one or two a day which is really hard to do, but with the cost I want them to last a little while before having to order again.  Try them, I assure you, you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Pretty decent
review/text: It's nice round, sweet blueberry flavor.  It's a smidge sweeter/more syrupy than I like so went online to see if it had sugar added.  No sugar, but the licorice powder does explain it.  I normally HATE licorice, so I'm suprised that I still think this is a decent tea.  I don't think it overwhelms the flavor as much as the other reviewer does, but the sweet slightly syrupyness of it does have a lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />I liked it enough, was actually going to give this 4 stars until I realized that I probably wouldn't buy it again, and am unlikely to drink it again except when I need something warm and decaf.  If I'm not excited to drink it again, then I probably didn't like it that much.

review/text: It tastes pretty good; a nice blueberry flavor.  But the flavor is somewhat obscured by the licorice root.  The aftertaste is licorice, too.  Too bad, since the other flavors are so nice.<br />I also tried the raspberry, which was very, very nice.  For some reason the licorice root is not as detectable in the raspberry.  You can taste it somewhat, just not as much as this one.

review/text: The Lemon Lotus is a wonderful product. Absolutely delicious, it's like drinking a glass of sweet lemonade with an ever so slight hint of the x50 Blue Lotus extract flavor (which I also love).<br /><br />I like how they switched from the shots to the powder. It dissolves easily when steeped and stirred into hot water (or when funneled into a water bottle and shook). I prefer this for 2 reasons.<br />One, the shots where just that, shots. As a powder I can enjoy a whole glass of it!<br />Two, I can more easily control the dose -- stronger when I'm in a bad mood, or weaker if I just want a nice refreshing drink.<br /><br />As for its effects, I would say overall, it subtly puts me into a calmer, more talkative and generally happier mood.<br /><br />Overall, I really love this product and will definitely buy more as needed. Was shipped and arrived very quickly and Mood & Mind have always been more than happy to answer any questions I have about their products.<br />Highly recommended, 5/5!!!

review/summary: Lemon Lotusade? Lemonotusade? Whatever you call it, it's great!
review/text: In the time since I first discovered blue lotus, I've tried several conventional and a few unconventional methods to to consume it. The first time I got the powder, I just sort of grabbed a handful and dumped it into my mouth. That did not go well.<br /><br />Next I tried dumping a few tablespoons into yogurt and then eating it. That also did not go well.<br /><br />I tried buying the plant itself and burning it, steeping it in hot water, and even tossing it into a salad, but overall, my favorite method was making a tea out of the powder.<br /><br />Or so I thought. I decided to try the mood drink despite my apprehensions, and boy am I glad I did! When I got it, I opted to have two servings at once, since I'm what you might call a tall drink of water (or lemon lotus drink, as the case may be), and after making the drink and seeing how easily it dissolved , I resisted my urge to pinch my nose and down it in one.<br /><br />It tasted GOOD! And I don't mean the sort of "good" where you grimace and rasp "H-hey, this is *cough* kind of good!", I mean good like a nice glass of lemonade, with a hint of blue lotus. There was no annoying grit (the biggest problem I have when I make tea, but that's my fault) and it had a nice effect that wasn't too overbearing. Yet another highly enjoyable experience from a company that actually cares about the quality of their merchandise.<br /><br />BONUS RECIPE: Lemon Lotus Piledriver<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />1-4 servings of Lemon Lotus Mood Drink<br />1 bottle of Perrier or something similar<br />1-4 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />Vodka (Citrus works well, but plain is fine too)<br />2 pinches of lemon salt<br />Ice<br /><br />Directions:<br />Mix lemon lotus powder with room temp vodka, mix until drink powder is thoroughly dissolved.<br />Add in Perrier and lemon juice, put into shaker with ice and shake vigorously.<br />Pour into highball glass, garnish with lemon wedges or lotus ice cubes and serve.<br /><br />PS: Check out my blog for more recipes and such!

review/summary: Relaxing and wonderful tast!
review/text: I have tried this product many times as it really, really helps relax and it helps with sleep. An FYI, it mixes really well with your favorite liqueur. I feel it mixes well with either Whiskey, like a whiskey sour, or with vodka. You need to try this! And beyond that, this Company has the best customer service I have encountered with any mail order Company. They really, really care!

review/summary: Disappointment
review/text: I'm not sure if the four I purchased were from a bad batch or what, but the product had no effect on me whatsoever. I have tried the blue lotus 50:1 tablets and was very satisfied. I thought a liquid blue lotus would be absorbed better by the body, thus a better effect. It was quite the opposite. You live and you learn I guess, but I wouldnt try this product again unless it was free.

review/summary: Its Worth a Try
review/text: 50:1 lemon lotus 4 pack shots (first time user) Item was mind altering but not as powerfull as expected, started with one shot early in the day and recieved mild effects felt sort of like an alcohol buzz, later in the day i had another shot and had the same effects as b4 drank a can of beer and another shot trying to get more out of the lotus within the hour i did not feel much of a change,had a 3rd shot and no change 45 minutes later i was sober. problem could be because i didnt use right, was left wondering if maby you can only get so much effect out of product similar to kratom (you can only get so high with kratom after that you get sick and misureable) then thought maby i was suposed to take all 4 shots at once for the great feeling and phychoactive or hipnotic effect who knows it was fun anyway. After i do more research on using lotus i will most likely buy this product again and give it another run.<br />  Please do not let my story discourage you from buying and trying this product. my intent was to get the message across if you dont know how to use this product learn about it first then try it out, that way the seller doesnt get blamed for your poor results

review/summary: Does Nothing!!!
review/text: This product is a complete waste of time and money.  Me and a friend tried it with a bottle of wine and it had absolutely no noticeable effects whatsoever on either one of us.  We did feel a little more sleepy than normal after taking it.  But other than that, this product did absolutely nothing to either one of us.  After my experience with this product, I am convinced the other reviews are either shill reviews or from inexperienced users who merely received a placebo effect from this product.

review/summary: Surprisingly non-sweet
review/text: This one is interesting. The smell is very distinct, and I must admit I'm not very fond of the aroma.<br />Now the flavor is entirely different. I was immediately struck by its lack of sweetness (compared to other honeys). It tasted more like a sweet cooking sauce. The taste actually reminds me of "five spice powder" used in Chinese cooking, sweetened with a bit of molasses. This is definitely one for cooking, particularly meats. I think that with some savory and pungent spices, a little soy, and perhaps a splash of rice wine, this would make an amazing honey chicken glaze.

review/summary: Good for finicky cats!
review/text: My female cat is so finicky, that in eight years and dozens of different brands and flavors, I have not found a single cat treat that she will eat.<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />I got a free bag as a promotion, and she went absolutely nuts! The male cat will eat anything, so he eats these too, but it's the only treat the female cat will eat. So now when I walk by the kitchen cabinet where it's stored, I have not one but TWO yowling cats, demanding treats!

review/summary: My fickle cats love them
review/text: I must agree with the other 2 reviews. My cats are so-o-o-o-o picky but they never turn up their noses when I offer these treats.<br /><br />My cats refuse almost every other treat I offer. Sometimes they will eat another type of treat but after 1 or 2 days, they refuse to eat anymore. These are the best!<br /><br />ps: when your cat gets bored with a favorite toy, don't throw it out. Put it away in a closet for a few months & one day when they seem bored again, bring it out of the closet and give it to them. They will be excited about it again. Cats are like kids so rotate the toys and everyone will be happy.

review/text: My cat enjoys these, and buying them off Amazon saves money, but I've noted she's less enthusiastic about this flavor, and she'll only eat it if we're out of every other treat and she's completely desperate not to eat her regular food.  It's not just my cat either; my friend's cat doesn't like them as much as the ones in the orange or blue bags.  Stay away from the cheese flavored ones in the yellow bag; I can only assume they're really gross as they just set in the dish, untouched.

review/summary: just okay
review/text: I'm glad other people's cat liked these, but my cats are both indifferent to them. I got these because my cat went crazy over the cheese puff treats I bought at Target, I think they are call crispies or something. They literally almost ripped the bag apart when it was left closed sitting on the counter because they can smell it through the bags. I have 2 kittens and they fought each other whenever I grab for the bag, no other time do they act like this it's almost as if it's drugs or something. I was hoping for the same effect with these, but my kittens both treat these like it's slightly tastier dry food. P.S. I have 1 himalayan and 1 orange tabby.

review/summary: Beachside Party Mix
review/text: I've given my cats a few different kinds of treats daily & these are by far their favorites.... They love them more than any of the others and come running as soon as they here me get the package out. Really helps clean their teeth so it helps get rid of that bad kitty breath from eating other soft chewy treats. I won't buy the soft treats anymore as thier breath is so bad from it & they love these the best & so do I. They cost $1.50 a pack in the Walmart store so they are even cheaper here to buy & no sales tax, at least not in Iowa on these. I haven't tried the other flavors because these give them a variety so why bother with just one flavor.

review/summary: Cheaper than Petsmart with Subscribe and Save
review/text: If your cat loves these treats like mine do, this is an excellent deal. I went with Subscribe and Save, which dropped the price to 20 cents less per pack than I normally pay. Cats are happy, and I am happy with the treats!

review/summary: Party mix is now one of my cat's favorite treats
review/text: The various Friskies "party mix" flavors of treats really appeal to my cat's taste buds. They are his new favorites. Especially the Beachside Crunch version. He used to be a treat fanatic, but lately he hasn't been eating as many treats because he's been filling up more on wet food; that's sort of replaced his "dry treat" routine. However, he usually will still eat the party mix if I give it to him, even if he shuns other treats.<br /><br />And one other great thing about party mix - the price is cheap, but you get a lot for your money, since it is a good-sized bag. Great taste, great value - what's not to like?

review/summary: All my 7 cats love it
review/text: I have tried a lots of treats for my 7 cats, 3 in door, 4 our door semi feral cats that "adopted us". The Good life brand is great but it is too expensive. Temptation is great for some and miss for the others. But this one everyone loves, and it is more affordable so I can keep them happy all the time. Wish they would offer larger packages and more flavors. The tiny 2 oz packages runs out really quick here.

review/text: I have tried and tried to feed my cat fancier cat treats (Real Meat, fish flakes, etc) but she isn't having it. Despite eating superfancy Fromm Four Star cat food in exotic flavors like Duck and Surf  Turf, you would think shewas starving from the way she comes sprinting the moment I shake the Friskies treat bag.

review/text: All 4 of my cats love these Friskies Party Mix.  They have had all the flavors except the beef/liver which I haven't seen in my grocery store but may yet buy on Amazon.  My cats and the neighbor's cat who comes by to mooch love Friskies Party Mix.  I was buying Party Mix and Temptations but several of my cats will not touch Temptations so I quit buy it.  They all much prefer the Party Mix.  Today I purchased 4 of these to stock up.

review/text: My mom's elderly cats adore the Original Crunch favor of these treats but they are very difficult to find around here for less than $1.80 a pouch.  We buy them 20 pouches at a time (so they qualify for free shipping) and have them sent right to the house.  Very convenient for everyone.

review/text: The Friskies Party Mix Beachside Crunch is my cat's favorite treat.  However, they are difficult to find in our area.  The price on these is comparable to what I would pay at the super market (perhaps slightly cheaper).  They arrived well packaged, no damage.  I will definitely order these again.

review/summary: Good treats for your feline
review/text: These treats not only taste good (I am assuming that since my cats looooove them!) but they are good for them; they control tarter.  My vet told me to get tarter control treats for one of my four felines who suffered from teeth problem and he is fincky (no his name is not Morris, but it might as well be!).  Anyway,there are only two treats he will eat and this is one of them!

review/text: I love this gum and it is hard to find.  When I saw it on Amazon, I decided to order it through the internet.  However, I am VERY dissatisfied in the fact that the product packaging was opened and I was shorted a pack of gum.  I tried to e-mail Amazon and have received no response.  Don't like the fact that there is not a phone number available to call anyone to discuss this issue with.  The product I like, however, if I had to rate Amazon, it wouldn't be a good rating.

review/text: A few months ago we were told at our local CVS that Trident had stopped making this gum.  My three teenagers and I love this gum.  Their friends all love it when my kids share this gum.  We began ordering the gum online in bulk to delay the inevitable.  I guess Trident hasn't stopped making the gum, but we sure still love it.  The price is better online, especially with free shipping, and we go through packets of it like crazy.

review/summary: Best Gum I have ever chewed!
review/text: This is the BEST gum I have ever chewed...great long lasting peppermint flavor... not too strong... just the right amount of sweetness that freshens your mouth. Once I start chewing this gum....its hard to resist the urge to chew another one.<br /><br />A WORD OF CAUTION - most sugar free gums have sorbitol and aspartame which are harmful if consumed in large quantities. Google "sorbitol" and "aspartame" and read the harmful effects yourself. So I would suggest to consume this gum in limited quantities and only after going through the ingredients.<br /><br />But other than this, I love this gum and have run out of the pack of 20 I purchased from Amazon subscribe and save at a cheaper price. However, I was a bit disappointed since Amazon cancelled my next Subscribe and Save shipment stating they are out of this gum and then bumping up the price by $3. But it would be unfair to give this gum anything less that 5 stars as it really awesome compared to some of the other gums I have chewed before.

review/summary: Dog food that even the pickiest dog (and owner!) will love
review/text: Natural Balance Ultra Premium Formula for Dogs is the only dog food I'll now give to my pups. I have a picky-eating Jack Russell who also suffers from skin allergies. I tried multiple different brands and types of foods before finding Natural Balance- it's the only dog food that he instantly loved, and continues to eat (bag after bag after bag!). The food is high quality and the bags rarely come with pieces crumbled in the bottom. The premium formula has helped cure my Jack Russell's skin problems, and keeps his coat shiny.<br />I also give the Natural Balance Ultra Premium Reduced Calorie Formula to my just-slightly-over-weight Boston Terrier. While feeding her the same quantity of food, she's been able to loose 2lbs in a month.<br />Natural Balance is a fabulous dog food brand- get it for your dogs, they'll love you for it!!

review/text: I have a 3 year old Jindo rescue who was skinny and had a poor coat when we got her. Since we started her on this food, her double coat is soft, shiny, and thick.  She's put on solid weight, muscle lean weight, not fat. And she loves this stuff!  The first few days we gave her the Science Diet the shelter gave us free. She wouldn't eat it. We got some of this, and she scarfed the bowl in seconds.  We even give it to her as little treats during the day.  I read online that Jindos can have issues with corn and I had another dog with corn allergies so Natural Balance is a perfect choice. Just read the ingredients. Nothing you should avoid.  And the price through Amazon with free shipping is less than at the local big box store.

review/summary: Dogs like it better than Blue Buffalo
review/text: I have always fed my dogs Science Diet and they seemed to do ok, but now with all the buzz about dog diets, I wanted mine to  have the best so I switched to Blue Buffalo. It was very expensive and I have 4 dogs, so I had to keep trying to find it on sale.(a losing battle) One day I tried another brand and my dogs liked it but it was recalled, so I knew I had to find a reliable brand and stick to it. I returned to Blue Buffalo. They seemed to really like it so I decided to stay with it. Then one day on Amazon, I noticed Natural Balance Ultra Premium for small breeds. The price was great, the ingredients were great, so I ordered it. I still had some Blue Buffalo left so I kept it in one bowl and put Natural Balance in another bowl. I figured I'd let the dogs choose. They ate all of the Natural balance and just ignored the other. I filled the bowl again and again they ate all of the Natural Balance and ignored Blue. My dogs made their choice and I'm sticking with it.
