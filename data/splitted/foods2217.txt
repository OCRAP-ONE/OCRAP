review/summary: People are using this the wrong way....
review/text: I think the problem with this product is people don't realize that this is a product to use to seal moisture into the hair.  It does say SEAL on the product but if you don't know what that means, you will end up with a problem.  I took a small amount and used it on my damp hair to seal the moisture after shampooing and conditioning and using my leave in.  It can also be used on dry hair to add moisture or sheen.  Basically this is a what a lot of us african americans use as hair or scalp oil to be used to keep hair from being brittle.  Please don't use as a conditioner or deep conditioner as it is not meant for that.  I found it did its job just fine when used in the manner intended.

review/summary: Use Very Lightly! Or better yet, Save Your Money.
review/text: Ok. So I bring it home (from Wal-Mart) and look for the directions on the jar.. What Directions!?<br />Since my hair is dry especially on the ends and in my excitement of actually finding something to help my problem, I immediately hop into the shower and start gobbing this stuff all over into my hair/scalp. Oh NO! That was a BIG MISTAKE!! I had the greasiest head of hair (and I have very long hair).. UGH!<br />And let me tell you, washing it out with your average shampoo won't cut it. I contiued to wash multiple times for two days until this morning in a moment of desperation (lightbulb turned on) I run into my kitchen and snatched the Dawn dishwashing liquid which did help immensely after two good latherings. It's not all out but I'm on my way..<br /><br />Buyer beware of what you are getting yourself into when you see this innocent looking jar of "hair therapy".

review/summary: Excellent Balm
review/text: I have very frizzy hair so I was really excited to try this product. I wasn't holding out much hope that this five dollar balm would be able to cure years of hair frizz problems, but I was wrong. Clear Scalp & Hair is the real deal.<br /><br />The balm took a couple tries to work, but I definitely noticed a difference. My hair felt softer and didn't stand up as much. I didn't get the greasy feel that I was worried about at all.<br /><br />If you have hair frizz issues, give Clear Scalp & Hair a chance. The product is not very expensive and I noticed a big difference. I found it to be an excellent product that I would definitely try again.

review/summary: It's alright
review/text: First of all, I accidentally ordered this.  I'm not African American so the product was not for me.  So I gave it to an African American friend and together we reviewed it. She has short natural hair with no processing or chemicals on it.<br /><br />1.  No directions.  Really?  It didn't matter to my friend who knew immediately what it was for and how to apply it.  But we're both the kind that would like to see directions.<br /><br />2.  Smell was wonderful.  The texture was like Vaseline.<br /><br />3.  My friend said the product did exactly what it was supposed to do.  It sealed in moisture.  Both of us could see how gunky and oily it could get if applied improperly.<br /><br />Bottom line:  For the price and ease of use, this ranks high.  A little goes a long way so be frugal with it.

review/summary: Not heavy
review/text: I read the previous reviews for this scalp balm; I'm glad that I decided to get it anyway. There are a number of ingredients in here that would make one think that this would be heavy, but it wasn't. As someone who deals with dry scalp, I'm always looking for hair/scalp oils to use. Sometimes, I  miss the mark and get something that weighs my hair down, and makes it overly oily. Considering that this is hair "grease" this was light and fluffy, compared to the others that I've  used. It had a pleastant smell, and didn't make my hair greasy. I put it in my hair 3 days ago, and I haven't had any itching. I will happily use tyhe rest of my sample and buy some more

review/summary: Seems like it's more a hair treatment than a scalp treatment
review/text: Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy - I thought the name spelled out what I was looking for, but the only way this could help your scalp is to apply it directly to the scalp.  The consistency of the product is very much like shortening ... and requires as much shampoo to get it out of your hair as if you had used shortening.  It has a nice, but very strong fragrance.  If you are looking for dry scalp relief, keep looking (and please let me know if you find something!).

In any event, the product is akin to putting Vaseline on my scalp and I haven't used it very often.  I can use it in the shower as an additional conditioner and wash it out, however.  I noted the review on here from an AA person and they were happy with the product so really, I would direct you to their review for a more informative look into said product.  On a positive note, it does smell very nice and their shampoo and conditioner are quite awesome.

review/summary: Naturally curly & color treated hair can benefit from Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm
review/text: First off I do understand that this product was not intended for my hair, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't benefit it. My hair is now just below my shoulders, naturally curly and color treated. Additionally I live in the rainy Pacific Northwest which encourages more frizziness than I care for. Because of all of these things I tend to use many products on my hair to be able to keep the style that I like.<br /><br />My routine usually has me conditioning daily, but only shampooing every two to three. This keeps my hair from drying out and much easier to manage. For styling I use both mousse and hair spray to finish it off. Thankfully I've found a mousse with low alcohol content, but that's next to impossible for a hairspray. Even the ones that are recommended for "less frizz" or to protect from humidity I find dry my hair out horribly. So with trial and error, I have found that sometimes products like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9DS">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm</a> can help prevent that dryness when used in small amounts.<br /><br />For this particular product I use approximately a dime size amount warmed up and rubbed through my hands, then applied ONLY to my hair ends.  I do this before applying any other products and while my hair is still lightly damp. The result is that my ends don't frizz out from the dryness and humidity, but that they also don't look greasy or oily from too many hair products. I've been very pleased with the results I've had and because of the amount I use I can expect this tub to last a very long time.<br /><br />*I've also added a picture of my hair into the customer images, showing me a week into using the product on a daily basis.

review/summary: For African America Hair
review/text: I don't know why they don't label products clearly. Whatever it is, I have straight baby fine hair that is now FILLED with grease.  I thought it was a conditioner-type product and was excited to moisturize my hair.  OOPS.  This product would probably be very nice for someone with more course, curly or kinky hair and possibly helpful for a dry scalp...maybe for black people?  Duh.  I hate politically correct BS.  Hair products aren't hate products.  The MAIN INGREDIENT IS PETROLEUM JELLY...which I am too old and blind to have read BEFORE I slimed my hair.<br /><br />I do like the smell of the product and I didn't want to knock the rating because it may be a wonderful product for African American hair or someone with hair that is very similar.  But if you have straight long fine hair, I would stay away.  I will be using Dawn dishwashing liquid for DAYS to get this out.

review/summary: This is for relaxed and natural hair, and it works very well!
review/text: I read some of the other reviews and, yes, some of the reviewers don't understand what a balm is.  You apply it to your hair and scalp after you've washed, conditioned and dried your hair (I suppose you could apply it to your hair before you dry it, too, but that's not how I use it).  It softens the hair and moisturizes.  I have natural hair (I'm African American), and this works really well to soften my hair.  Use a small amount.  The jar will obviously last a long time.  I'm not wild about the scent.  But after a while I don't notice it.

review/summary: Hard to give a Clear Review
review/text: and I say that because this product isn't designed for my hair.<br /><br />My father is Caucasian, my mother is Vietnamese.  I have a lot of hair.  I wouldn't call it oily, but in the summer it can look that way if left to it's own devices.  My hair is a little longer than shoulder length and I have rather heavy bangs.<br /><br />In the Virginia summer, my ends can FRIZZ.  And I dislike it, so when I was given this to try, I thought it would be right up my alley.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, there are no directions on the jar, but I gave it a shot.  Let me say this...it smells wonderful!  And I thought I would use it like a leave in hair treatment.  Since it is so thick (someone else said almost like shortening, and I would agree with that!) I used just a bit and coated my hair with it.<br /><br />My hair felt nice as it was drying, but a few hours later it felt heavy, and rather greasy.  I didn't like the way it felt,and I jumped in the shower again to wash it out.<br /><br />The more I looked at it the more I began to think this is not for women with my hair type.  While looking online I did indeed find the product, and it is marketed for African American women.<br /><br />I was very surprised to find that the main ingredient in this is petrolatum.  The same stuff in AD ointment.  WHY would you to put that on your hair?<br /><br />As I stated, it is hard for me to give a proper review as it isn't made for my hair type, but I can't imagine anyone wanting to put AD ointment/Vaseline on their hair.

review/text: I have 4a/b/c hair and have read tons of materials about which products are best for our hair type. I thought that it was best to get away from petroleum,  and mineral oil, which are the two main ingredients in the Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm. However, I gotta go with what I know and not what I read. This stuff works!! It totally coats and seals in moisture for my porous, dry quickly hair. It is VERY light and a little goes a long way. Now, when I was growing up, everybody had long, flowing hair, when their mama's greased their scalp twice a week and they wore protective styles. What did our mama's grease our scalp with? THIS STUFF, minus the shea butter. I'm going back to the old school ways with a new school twist on it.

review/text: I have a problem with the ingredients of this item. All of the cheap ingredients are listed first. Things like Petrolatum, Mineral Oil and Paraffin. Then comes fragrance. Then come the cool sounding ingredients like Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Wheat Germ Oil and Aloe. In other words there's less Shea Butter which is part of name of the item than there is fragrance and it only takes a minute amount of chemical fragrance to scent up an item like this.<br /><br />I don't like it when companies put infinitesimal amounts of positive sounding ingredients in a product just so they can add them to the ingredient list. Basically this is a gel of petroleum and wax products with scent. It feels very oily on the scalp. The scent is unpleasant. I really have nothing positive to say about it.

review/summary: Grease for your hair, and door hinges, and bike chains, and...and...and
review/text: Wow! This was not what I was expecting. After having pretty good success with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9G0">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce</a>, I was thinking this would be like a gel version of that, but this is nothing more than a big tub of Vaseline from a different manufacturer. It feels slick on the fingers, but goes onto the scalp and hair sticky, as in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ULBP9Q">Elmer's All-Purpose Glue Sticks, Large, 0.77 oz Each, 3 Sticks per Pack (E5022)</a> sticky. Using just a little dab, my hair was compacted onto the top of my head for the rest of the day. I tried to use a little less the next day and ended up shampooing it out. I prefer my hair to have a little flow to it and not leave me looking like a Bob's Big Boy doll. The first (and main) ingredient of this is petroleum jelly (petrolatum), so, this shares the same uses as Vaseline. I wouldn't recommend putting this on your head unless you are absolutely sure nothing else will control your hair and you really want to keep every single hair from moving for an entire day. As for me, I'm going back to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GFXMQ">Fekkai Glossing Cream Hair Products 4 Oz</a>.

No big deal, we'll just rinse, lather, repeat....<br /><br />...again.<br /><br />......and again.<br /><br />My arms are tired, my baby is awake, and my hair still feels like I dumped it into a vat of pure petroleum.<br /><br />Pretty much because I did.<br /><br />My husband asked me if I was trying something new, while gently hinting that it wasn't good.  He's a smart man.<br /><br />I came to read the other reviews and see if maybe it was user error, and to find a solution to de-grease my mane. This is when I realized I was not alone.<br /><br />Excuse me, while I go buy some Dawn dish detergent.

review/summary: It works, but leaves my hair oily- Great as a skin softener
review/text: OK- to be fair I ordered this thinking it was for all hair types, but I suspect it is meant to be used for more coarse, thick hair- not my Swedish blonde strands. While it does work very well, it leaves my hair with an oily appearance. Something I a not looking for. I also liked the gentle smell of honey and Shea butter. When left with the dilemma of having so much left in the container after deciding it wasn't made for my locks I wondered if it could be helpful to other dry skin areas. I rubbed a bunch into my feet (I teach and am on them all day long so they were cracked heels and sides) and put on a pair of socks for bed. When I woke up the next day they were so much better looking! I repeated this process three nights in a row and my feet look pampered and soft. While I understand this is not the "recommended" use of this product it REALLY works for dry skin too. I would continue to buy it just for this use.

review/text: I'm a 53 year old caucasian woman with very long color treated hair.  I've used the shampoo, conditioner, and scalp oil in this line and they seemed to work very well so I was psyched to try this product.  I thought it would be like a deep conditioning cream but it was more like the consistency of Desitin which unfortunately made my hair greasy.  I had to wash my hair twice to remove all the residue because the balm wouldn't soak into my hair.<br /><br />This balm has a nice scent and I'm sure that if you have very thick, curly or coarse hair you might want to give this product a try.  Also, if you are a swimmer you might give this a try as well.  Back when I was a swimmer I used to coat my hair with a product similar to this, put it in a braid and then cover it with a swim cap.  The product kept my color treated hair from turning into green staw on long swims.  Since I no longer swim, I've been using the Clear Scalp Nourishing Balm on my elbows and heels.  Waste not want not.

It does leave your hair a touch greasy, so I use it at night to nourish so I can wash it out in the morning and have no dandruff flakes.  This product is a balm, so it's thick and comes out similar to sculpting gel (although it does not style!).  It smells like fresh coconut, reminds me of a day at the beach, very nice! It goes on smooth and really soothes.  In addition to helping with dandruff, I got a sunburn on my part and used this and it prevented my scalp from being dry and grossly peeling! Overall, this is an AWESOME product and I will be using it regularly.

review/summary: Good stuff, complete lack of information.
review/text: I have baby fine hair and everything weighs it down.  When I was younger it was also oily and I had to wash it every day and never bothered with a conditioner.  Those days are over.  Now if I don't use a conditioner I tend to look like something that should be standing out in a cornfield scaring away birds.  But conditioners still tend to weigh my hair down so my options often seem to be scarecrow or Moe (Three Stooges, for you young'uns.  Look him up.)<br /><br />I thought I'd try the Clear nourishing balm because you never know, right?  Well frankly, even after I got it, I wasn't sure what the heck to do with it because there are no instructions for use.  NONE.  It's best guess time.  So I tried applying it to dry hair, very sparingly, and the result was pretty darn good.  It softened my hair and made it look less straw-like.  And surprisingly, my hair wasn't gummy the next day.<br /><br />So then I tried it on damp hair.  I shampooed, toweled off, and applied a small amount, massaging it in well.  Then I toweled again lightly.  And THAT was the best choice by far.  My hair dried soft and reasonably manageable (as much as it ever is) without being limp or greasy-looking.  It's still looking pretty good even on the second day.<br /><br />So based on my experience, what you need to do is run your fingertips over the surface of the balm, then rub your hands together.  Once the balm is distributed over both hands, rub them through damp hair.  If you want to towel off afterwards, fine, if not I imagine it'd still work pretty well.<br /><br />Some people are implying that this is made for softening and taming African-American hair, and that might be so; I really couldn't say because again, the information given is pretty slim.  All I can say is that for this old white woman with dry, fine hair, it works pretty well so long as I use it frugally.<br /><br />It got a star off for the complete lack of information given on the label.  There's no real excuse for that.

review/text: I am Caucasian and I have thick frizzy hair, since I also bleach my hair I deal with breakage. I'm always willing to try a product that can offer any kind of nourishment or deep conditioning for my hair so I thought id give this Clear scalp and hair therapy Ultra Shea a try.<br /><br /> Upon opening the container (which is quiet large for the price) I noticed the texture is pretty similar to Vaseline nursing jelly its also reminded me of this body butter I used to use when pregnant. But I still wanted to try it so I figured that since a lot of people had a hard time getting it out that maybe they put to much on.<br /><br />There are no instructions on the container or on Amazon.com so I use my shampoo and conditioner as always then gently  grazed my finger across the top twice, rubbed my hands together and massaged it through my hair and got out.<br /><br />I put no other product in my hair and when I went to straighten my hair I couldn't believe my eyes! My hair had absolutely no frizz and was so silky smooth,and I also had a lot less breakage then when I usually straighten my hair.  I mean I can tell if you put to much its gonna be greasy so just keep in mind a little goes a long long way.<br /><br />Overall this is a great product (if it is used correctly) at a great price I however gave it 4 stars due to lack of directions. This is a product that I will continue to use for years to come and I will be recommending it to others!

review/summary: good for frizz
review/text: Like the hair oil they have I think this product name/description is misleading. The product name is "Ultra Shea" and the product features emphasize the "Nutrium 10 moisture lock system" (a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils, including vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan and palm). Yet, when you read the ingredients, the first four ingredients are:  Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Paraffin, Lanolin Wax. The "featured" ingredients don't come until AFTER fragrance on the ingredient list, so that means there's not much of them at all in the product, yet they are emphasized in the product features.<br />Having said that, I still like the product. I have frizzy, curly hair and I have used petrolatum products before for my hair and they help control the frizz. My favorite petrolatum type product is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E763K4">Alberto VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing</a>. This product is very similar to that.

review/summary: Heavy moisture
review/text: Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy Ultra Shea is intensive moisture for your scalp which presumably helps healthier hair to grow. It has a nice scent.  You can smell the Shea butter with hints of floral mixed in. The product is very thick, about the consistency of Vaseline. That's not surprising considering the first several ingredients are oil and wax -petrolatum, mineral oil, paraffin, lanolin wax. Then there's some fragrance, more oils, Shea butter, and more oils.<br /><br />My scalp tends to get dry, so I thought this might be a good product to help with that problem. My hair is long and fine, which made me hesitant to use too much. I didn't want it to weigh down my hair in an effort to moisturize my scalp. The directions aren't very explicit - 1. Cleanse  2. Smooth  3. Soothe  4. Seal (in bold type). I took that to mean I washed my hair as usual and used this product afterward to seal in moisture. I used a pea sized amount and found a little goes a long way. When my hair dried though, it looked like my roots were greasy. I washed my hair again and it looked clean. I think my hair is the wrong texture to use this product, but I have found another way to use it. Years ago, I had an Aveda product to tame fly-aways and it felt just like this does. If I take a small amount of the Ultra Shea, less than a pea, and rub it in a thin coat over my palms, I can then gently wipe my palms down the sides of my hair to keep any wispy strands in place. It also adds some shine to my hair. So I don't use it as it's intended, but it's a product that works for me.

review/summary: Oops, wrong hair type
review/text: I got this for my husband who's always complaining about how dry his scalp is. Unfortunately, he has straight, fine hair and is Caucasian, so this product wasn't exactly suited to his needs. It is very greasy, even when just a little is applied, and takes several washes to get it all out. I read some of the other reviews and there seems to be a consensus regarding how it's better suited to African American hair type and not so much for Caucasian hair types. One other thing is that this product contains Petrolatum.

review/summary: Great Product... If you are in the target market.
review/text: Notice that lovely black lady in all of the ads for this product? Well, about 75% of the U.S. population is going to regret purchasing this. Unless you happen to be among the other 25% who have round, ultra-curly, kinky hair and a dry scalp (mostly African Americans, some Hispanics, some Indians, some Jews, and a few whites--Irish & Italians primarily), you might not enjoy your experience with this. This product is meant for people who have a skin type where they do not wash their hair daily, as it would mean a loss of moisture and this dandruff. Most of the population (usually white people) have flat, bone-straight, feathery hair with an scalp naturally gets so oily it requires washing at least every two days, if not daily. Apply this product will make their hair too oily, and attempts to shampoo it out will be rather difficult. LOL. There is a reason why so many call it "grease").<br /><br />There relatively is nothing wrong with this product, apart from the fact that they didn't do a good enough job in letting people know who the target market is, and thus, plenty of people with the wrong hair/scalp type ended up suffering with it. Perhaps that lovely black lady should have been put on the container to clear up confusion.<br /><br />I personally like this product. It is better formulated and lighter in application than most hair products targeted towards African Americans. I feel that I can moisturize my entire scalp and not need too much of this product to accomplish that. It also smells a lot better than many of its leading competitor products (e.g., Blue Magic, Dax, Ultra Sheen).<br /><br />Another reviewer commented that they disliked the fact that this product because it contained mineral oil. Well, mineral oil can be good or bad, depending on your hair type and personal biology. For some people, it dries their scalp out and for others, it locks in moisture. The ingredient itself is harmless and is GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the FDA, which is the safest an ingredient can get.

review/summary: A good hair and scalp balm
review/text: I've had problems with my scalp and hair being dry with different hair products and usually my hair is just flyaway fine.  But...this balm makes my hair feel soft, thick, and full.  First, I wash my hair and comb it out. Then, while it is still wet, I put a dab or two on my hands and starting at my scalp I smooth it through my hair.  Next, I blow dry my hair on the low setting.  My hair looks great, it isn't greasy and my scalp isn't dry and flaky.  The very faint shea scent is pleasing.  I would prefer Unilever not test on animals...after all how many animals have you seen that use hair balm?  I rated this at four stars and would have given it five if Unilever didn't do amimal testing.  If function outweighs process you may consider it at five stars as this product works nicely and I would recommend it.

review/text: I have pale skin, blue eyes and light yet thick hair. I used a tiny bit of this product on my hair.  Not the scalp mind you, but the ends of my hair.  Maybe a dime size of it. It seemed to make the ends really nice. I am not sure if that is the use of it, for products in this line seem to not have directions, or they say to treat the hair with it, so it really isn't a scalp product.  Unless you have a really dry scalp and use a very small amount of this.

review/summary: Great stylish balm for dry hair
review/text: I've tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9G0">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce</a> and I loved it, so I decide to try the balm next. It's a great product, very concentrated and it has a nice scent like the oil, but it will last longer. This product is for dry hair, truly dry hair, the kind that one applies some of this balm on tonight and the next morning, the hair had absorbed it. I have such hair, my hair is also curly, and long. So this balm helps me to stylish it, and keeping it shining too.<br /><br />With this product less is more, one only needs to rub a little amount of the balm between one's palms before applying it all over the hair and scalp. It keeps the hair in place if stylished in a braid or a chignon.<br /><br />Its main purpose is to seal the hair from humidity, and this is easily accomplished. The best way to do this is to use the same method I described above,  applying a smaller amount of the balm to the hair right after it has been styled with the hair dryer. It will seal the hair, preventing it from becoming frizzy. This is something I learned years ago from my hairdresser, who uses a very similar, but more expensive  product to accomplish this. I definitely recommend this one to anyone with dry, frizzy hair.

I am very disappointed because I got this after reading this was for dry scalps.  In the winter my head gets very dry and I can only wash my hair every 5 days or so.  But when I got this home and I saw the for natural or relaxed hair on the front I knew it wasn't for me.  Not only that but there are no directions as to how to use it.<br /><br />This product just wasn't for me but was marketed like it was.  I'm disappointed because I would like a product like this but I have a tub of vaseline already at home so I don't need another one.<br /><br />2 stars because even though I didn't care for the product it did smell nice.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I have been taking a VERY small amount, a petite pea size, and rubbing it into my scalp then shampooing it out and it has left my hair quite silking and manageable.

review/summary: Vaseline and baby oil....not for all hair types
review/text: When this came into Vine, I was excited to see it! I thought (from the limited description) that it would be an intense in-shower conditioner cream. But, it's not. When I opened it, I had two thoughts immediately: wow does this smell great, and ... this looks like a bucket of lanolin.  NO instructions on usage whatsoever! Luckily I figured out that it was not something you use in the shower, or I probably would look like someone who had not washed their hair in a year.  The only inkling I had that this was PROBABLY not a product for my hair, was the "for relaxed and natural hair' on the front.<br /><br />I scooped out a tiny amount...half a teaspoon, and worked it through damp hair. I have thick frizzy curly hair, but it's whitey-girl hair. Um, yeah. This is not ok for my hair at any rate of usage. It feels so gross! But for anyone of a different ethnic background this stuff would probably be great.  The first ingredient is petrolatum (basically Vaseline) and mineral oil (baby oil) so if nothing else I could use this as a body moisturizer! But I'm going to pass it on to my friend from Israel with the most gorgeous corkscrew curls.  Someone else mentioned that they liked this as a flat iron balm; no way would I use this as that. Basically you are going to fry this `oil' with the flat iron. I tried it on a section of my ends and it just made them dank and lank and it left a heavy coating all over my flat iron that had to be cleaned off. My advice would be not to use it for that, unless you want to ruin your hair or your flatiron. What a mess!<br /><br />On the plus side, it smells FABULOUS! A sweet, dulce kind of smell. Almost a butterscotch or butter pecan. LOVE the smell!

review/summary: Poor Product Description On Unilever & Amazon's Behalf
review/text: Had Amazon written in its "product features" that Ultra Shea nourishing balm was intended for relaxed and natural hair, I would have known better (buzz words for ethnic hair).  Unfortunately I took Amazon's brief description (scalp dryness) at face value.  Only when the package arrived were the words "relaxed/natural" clearly visible on the jar.  One look at the product confirmed that this is not intended for Caucasians with dry hair.  The first four ingredients listed are petrolatum, mineral oil, paraffin and lanolin wax.  Instead of posting those ingredients which might have helped online consumers better understand what they are purchasing, Amazon describes the above ingredients as part of a "Nutrium 10 Moisture Lock System."  Who should I blame, Unilever or Amazon, for such lousy advertising?<br /><br />I'm certainly unqualified to review a product clearly not made for my hair type.  My jar of Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy nourishing balm will be passed on to someone who can appreciate its use.  I give low ratings for inadequate product description, not performance.  In the right hands, it's probably a wonderful and useful product.  Please rewrite a more clear product description to alleviate all this confusion.

review/summary: Made for African or Polynesian-type hair - 4a/b/c, maybe 3a/b
review/text: It's a shame to see this product get so many poor reviews, but it is due to the terrible labeling and the complete and utter lack of instructions on both the product and on the Unilever website at the time of this writing.<br /><br />Hair is classified on a scale of 1 to 4.  You can have several types of hair on your head.  Type 1 is straight hair.  Type 2a is wavy, and can be straightened and curled easily.  Type 2b is wavy, prone to frizziness, and hard to straighten.  I have a combination of type 2a and 2b, and when I was younger, had type 3a/b. This was way too greasy for my scalp and hair.<br /><br />Type 3a/b hair gets curlier and wavier as it gets longer, and is not as shiny as type 1 or 2.  Type 4a/b/c hair is often referred to as "natural" or "African" hair, and it is actually the most delicate of all hair types, thereby requiring a lot of care, plus appropriate use of moisturizing products.  That's what this Balm is for, type 4 hair, maybe some very dry type 3s, and if you read the five star reviews, you will see that folks with this kind of hair love it and know how to use the product.<br /><br />So, I am giving this three stars because it is not a good product as marketed, namely, without guidance or instructions.  It may be a good product if you have the right kind of hair, and in that case, you should give it a try.

review/text: While I'm not African American, I do have very crazy-curly and dry hair, and on top of that, chemically treated. I have found that moisturizing isn't enough, one needs to nurture and constantly feed your hair. I've used hair vitamins for a long time, and now when I saw this product that claims 'Intense Scalp Nourishing' I had to try it.<br /><br />It comes with no instructions of use, so I had to do my own googling. Here's the tiny bit of instruction I found: [...]<br /><br />The first time I put it on I deemed it greasy, but the fact is it only feels that way at first. It seems that the roots actually drink it up because a little while later my hair was not extremely greasy. While the actual process of putting it on is a little bothersome, I really like it.<br /><br />Just to be clear, if you have thin oily hair, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. I *do* produce oil, so while I like the product and it smells good I still don't put it on as soon as I wash it. I wash my hair every 3rd day, so on that third day I apply it and wear it up. But I can feel a softer, not-so-dry hair and scalp now.

review/text: Despite using my magnifying glass,  was unable to learn exactly how this product is to be used. It is very thick and I have no idea if it is to be applied to damp hair after washing, to dry hair before washing, or to be used as a brilliantine. It does have a pleasant scent, the the absence of directions is mystifying. There is a clear list of ingreients and it is being marketed as a scalp moisturizing balm. The ingredients include, in order of importance: Petrolatum,Mineral Oil, Paraffin, Lanolin Wax Fragrance Palm Oil,Shea Butter,Wheat Germ Oil,Seed Almond Oil, hydrogenated coconut oil, Sunflower seed oil,glycerin, soybean oil, etc., but they do give you a number to call for questions and comments: 1-800-896-952. I used a very small amount after washing my hair and tried as best I could to massage it into my scalp. I have short hair and I am using it to add shine to my hair which it does. with a very pleasant scent. Since it doesn't come with instructions, I am using it as a finishing balm for my hair. I just run my fingers over the goop and rub my two hands together to warm it up and then apply it to my hair. If this isn't correct, I trust someone will let me know. I use it very sparingly and the jar could last a very long time.

review/summary: Thick but not too greasy
review/text: I was quite pleased with the Clear shampoo and conditioner, finding that they did not weigh down my hair.  My hair is thin, straight, prone to getting oily and I seem to be losing hair with age.  So I was fearful when I first opened the intense scalp nourishing balm and tried putting it on dry hair.  I first applied it to the hair, then noticed it was for the scalp so worked it in and brushed it through, then went to bed.  There was little sign of actual grease the next morning but my hair did have a sheen that looked a bit greasy.  It was presentable but not great.<br /><br />The second time I used it was after shampooing and conditioning with the Clear products.  In the shower I rubbed a small amount into my scalp, then blow-dried my hair.  I have to report that it looks great, no greasy look or feel. It is important not to overdo the amount used since it is thick.  The jar may last me for 6-8 months. It would have been better if they had actually told you how to use it- the product basically lacks instructions.<br /><br />If you have thick, frizzy or curly hair I think the product would be better for you than for me, although I am pleased with it now that I have figured out how to use the product.  The smell is quite mild and pleasant.  The price is good for something that will last a long time.

I couldn't get it all out and will have to wash my hair a third time. Perhaps this product could be used on very dry, very coarse or very damaged hair. Perhaps it is intended for buzz cuts.

You've got a good new product line, but this is a huge oversight.

review/summary: No directions
review/text: As another review noted, there are no directions for the use of this product on or with the product(or anywhere I looked on the internet). I tested this product in 2 ways:<br />1. Applied the product to dry hair at the end of a day: dabbed a pea size drop or two in my hands..rubbed them together and applied them to hair---got the frizzes out, tamed the hair w/o taking too much body out.<br />2. Shampooed hair, applied product as *conditioner* and ended up with extra greasy hair.<br /><br />Frankly, I dont know how one would apply this  solely to the scalp unless they have hair less than an inch long. I tried to go primarily for the scalp in both my dry and wet applications and neither of the applications seemed to work for me in treating the scalp.<br /><br />Good to apply to dry, frizzy hair...otherwise, confusing for me

review/summary: A great product for dry scalps
review/text: I picked this item up for my mother who lives in a long term care facility and has trouble using her arms and hands.  Because of her limited mobility she has not been able to take care of her hair the way she used to  and has developed a dry scalp in the process. After giving her this product, her hair has become easier to work with and her dry and flaky scalp has almost faded. Also she loves the scent that is left behind witb each use.

review/summary: This product is very heavy
review/text: I think this product is designed more for Africa American women, as it is more of a heavy scalp treatment product and very oily.  I could see where it would be a good shine product for black hair, but too heavy of a conditioner for other (white women) hair types.  I will probably use this for a foot softening treatment and not on my hair.  It does smell VERY good though!

review/summary: I also put a giant glob in my hair while in the shower
review/text: I put a ton of this on my hair while I was in the shower.  I thought it was a conditioning masque.  It's not! I think I figured out that even though it doesn't say on the label anywhere or have real directions for that matter, that it's for African American hair.  It takes a lot of washing, blow drying and straightening to get it out.  It's still not all the way out but it's getting there.  **Blow drying it in makes your hair super shiny and soft so that was a nice plus to the other wise crappy situation.

review/summary: I like the end results!
review/text: I was so excited to try this product.  I have medium length naturally curly hair and the humidity really takes a toll on it.  I was stumped when I couldn't find any directions on the tub, but figured clean my hair, put some of this on, rubbing it into my scalp and then clear through to the ends of my hair. I let it set for several minutes then I washed it out.  Or I thought I did.  My head felt heavier than usual due to the oil that didn't come out in the shampoo.  I waited another day, hoping I would have better success and some of it did wash out, but it was still oilier than normal.<br /><br />Finally, the third day, washing my hair it finally had some semblance of my regular do.  It was silkier and looked healthier, but a word to the wise, use this hair therapy in very small increments.  Will I use it again? Definitely.  I like the end results.  I just need to moderate my use and quantity.  It smells great, by the way!

review/text: This product is light and more like "old school hair food" just not as oily/greasy. This is not something I can use regularly during the year's early Texas heat without being a sweaty and dare I say oily/greasy mess. As with the Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil a little goes a long way so does this product. This will be more of a cool weather product for me.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/14/2012: I do not recommend using this on WET hair. A dab of this balm used sparingly on DRY hair after using the Shampoo and Conditioner will deliver good results. The product is oily, coats the hair and adds shine.

review/summary: Works well. Perhaps too well.
review/text: This stuff smells great. Floral and tropical. That was the first thing I noticed when opening the container of Clear's Scalp Nourishing Balm. This is a different animal from their shampoos though. It is meant strictly for scalp nourishment, not as a hair conditioner (at least not for Caucasian hair).  It has a hard consistency but will 'melt' a bit to the touch. And all you need is a little bit.<br /><br />Of course, you don't really know what to do with it because there are no instructions on the packaging. Shame on the designers for neglecting this. It is very greasy and can be difficult to clean from one's hair. What I do is coat the tips of my fingers with it and rub directly on my scalp. It is NOT a hair conditioner or treatment. Some of it will make its way into your hair in any event, but this mitigates overdoing it. I apply it several minutes before my shower then use two applications of Clear <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AGC">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo</a>, so my scalp feels great and my hair is soft and manageable.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, one can find other uses for this heavy balm aside from moisturizing your scalp. It is effective on everything from rough skin to nail cuticles to squeaky hinges. There is a youtube video that explains its proper use so I recommend seeking that out. The nearly 7oz. jar should last you a long time, but I don't think I'll be getting this product again.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: confusing
review/text: My daughter gets dry scalp and so I thought I would have her try this. But there are no directions on the container?? What is up with that? I don't understand why the company would think that everyone knows how to use these products.<br /><br />By the looks of it when I opened it up, it seems more like a balm, so I assume it goes on dry hair, not wet hair in the shower. But we weren't sure whether it is suppose to be rubbed into the scalp, or just smoothed onto hair. My daughter tried rubbing some into her scalp, but wasn't overly thrilled with it, so she just started smoothing a little on her hair. She likes smooth, straight hair, and kind of liked how this balm looked, but not as much as other smoothing products she's used. So I doubt she will continue to keep using this product. We both are still wondering if we are even using it right. I think it's silly for them to not give better directions.

review/summary: A Greaseball's Delight
review/text: If you like the greaseball look, such as was popular waaaaaay back when, you can achieve that by getting a jar of this super grease from Clear. I got it because I have been using Clear shampoo which is a very good product and I expected this to be good for my hair and scalp as well. I figured that after a Clear shampoo I could just slap a dab of this Clear Balm and my hair would be more manageable and my scalp would benefit from the alleged "Therapy". Not so. This stuff is monumentally greasy. Once applied it defies all removal efforts for weeks. I will addmit that my use of this grease was not aided by any type of instruction, suggestion or comments from the maker. Nor was it packaged in any type of box or carton that might have some type of usage assistance printed on the sides. Nope, just a simple jar of ultimate grease. It does have one attribute in its favor and that is the odor. Not bad at all.<br /><br />Since I am not fool enough to use this on my hair again I tried to find a practical use for it. Recently I had a new garage door installed. The hinges made some noise during opening and closing. The installer said that they would be noisy just during the break-in period and that I should keep the hinges lubricated. I loaded the Clear grease into my grease gun and gave the hinges a shot of this amazing lubricant. My door is much quieter now and, as an unexpected additional benefit, it smells great. Useful and inexpensive - what a deal!

review/summary: How to use this.. if you are white!
review/text: Think of this like lip balm for hair. I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PB4UKW">Redken Structure Wax 17 for Unisex, 1.7 Ounce</a> per the recommendation of my hair stylist. She showed me how to use it and said this little 1.7 oz pot would last forever. I'm still using it months later, so she was right. Now I was curious about this product. It seemed like the Caucasian buyers were scooping this up as if it was a hair mask and wondering why their hair was so greasy. This is a great product for white hair if used in very very small amounts, like lip balm. Just run your fingers over the top of the product and then rub your hands together. Smooth your tresses. It's beautiful. Your hair will stay in place, it will have more gloss and shine. It will be easier to manage. I LOVE this product. Structure wax can only really be used on the ends, but I apply this sparingly with my fingertips (applying only the amount that adheres to my fingertips, not scoops of it!) and my hair looks fantastic. It really does lock the moisture in. If you use structure wax, use this in the same way and you'll be so happy to get 4 times the product for 1/4 the price!<br /><br />Also, I apply this to freshly blow dried hair or anytime I want to tame my hair, give it more gloss, and add moisture to my dry hair.

Mostly, I believed this helped me some, but I think it would help someone with very coarse hair far more.<br /><br />But it works, and it does what it says it will, which is why it deserves a four-star rating.<br /><br />Barb Caffrey

I was expecting this to be a heavy, gooey, greasy experience, however I am pleasantly surprised and happy to report that this actually helps to tame my dry color treated hair.  I color quite often due to the battle of the gray.  I use this on the ends of my hair prior to drying and straightening my hair.  The result, silky smooth healthy looking hair.  Easy to apply, but use sparingly a little goes a long way.

review/summary: Nice Sheen, does contain Mineral Oil & Petrolatum
review/text: This product didn't provide any extra moisture benefits that I could see or any extra nourishment.  The nourishment I think I would have to use for a longer period of time to see the benefit if any. It contains Nutrium 10 but I haven't been able to find out exactly what that is. Dove mentions Nutrium in some of their body washes but doesn't mention exactly what nutrium means.<br /> The product has a nice light fragrance, so you don't have to worry about any heavy or "chemically" smells in your hair. I liked the sheen that I got from using it but I can't say that it is a sheen that I can't get from using my other hair products.  The moisture wasn't any longer lasting than any other product that I use.This product can be used on natural or relaxed hair and does contain shea butter. The first ingrediet is Petrolatum, second is mineral oil, followed by paraffin then lanolin wax.  I try to avoid these ingredients but I did want to try the product out. There are some good oils ( sunflower seed oil, weet almond and coconut oil, etc) listed as well. The jar comes in a 6.7 oz size so you get a lot of product.  Overall a light moisutre balm that provides good sheen.

review/summary: Just a big ole tub of petroleum jelly
review/text: This product is made for African-American hair. Unilever (the makers) should just stop tip-toeing around this in their marketing. The model shown in the photo is an African-American woman of light complexion. On their website is African-American hair stylist, Oscar James, who does Tyra Banks' hair.<br /><br />It's a thick kind of pomade, with the pale yellow look, feel, and consistency of petroleum jelly because that's what it is! The first ingredient listed on the label is petrolatum. Next is mineral oil and paraffin. While prominently marketed as being made with expensive and luxurious sounding ingredients like shea butter and argan oil, it's really just a big tub of petroleum jelly with trace amounts of the good stuff in it, with no mention of petrolatum in the advertising. Because of this, the formulation is heavy and it leaves residue on the fingers. My co-worker tried some of this product, but prefers to make her own scalp and hair products from mixing natural oils herself.<br /><br />The ingredients in this product are not particularly high-end, but if you are looking for cost-control, it certainly fits the bill. The good stuff would cost a lot more than this.

review/text: This item is right up my ally being that I'm African American. It's a light hair grease. It does have some smoothing properties and of course, will make your hair shiny. The fragrance is light and pleasant. As for its promise to give you stronger hair in 7 days, I don't know and probably never will. I use so many products on my hair that I can't attribute any changes to any one. I do like it and depending on price, I'd be willing to buy it again. Again, It's light enough to not over saturate your hair with oil but heavy enough to provide the proper amount of nourishment for you to feel and see the difference. Since I've gotten it I've started applying it to my hair every night. Recommended.

review/text: Perhaps the only real fault of this product is lack of clear instructions on HOW TO USE IT.  I'm familiar with this type of hair care product, so I knew the one simple truth that helps make it wonderful: Use just enough to coat your hair in one layer.  Don't slather it on like it's a regular shampoo or conditioner.  This is a leave-in moisturizing conditioner than is meant to keep your hair slightly moist, thus preventing damage while healing previous damage.<br /><br />It does its job very well, but just make sure you aren't using too much.  If you end up overusing, you'll know it.  Your hair will be lanky, heavy, and uncomfortable, thus defeating the purpose of it.

I do like the smell of this product, and if used very, very sparingly, it does the job on my hair and scalp. Unfortunately, there were not directions, and nothing to indicate that the product was created for ethnic hair.  In fact, I was unaware of the fact until I started looking at the other reviews here.  Hopefully, the company will correct that because it seems to be an excellent product, just not for me.

review/text: I have to say I too was one with quick fingers that chose this product before I was aware it was for ethnic hair.  I'm sure that it's good for the right hair type but after opening the jar I knew there was no way this product would work with my hair but I do have extremely dry skin and had other ideas that it works great for.<br />When the humidity leaves the air in the fall I develop scaly dry patches on my wrist and hand (from washing my hands too much).  A small amount of this rubbed into the area took care of the problem. It leaves a waterproof coating over the area and takes many hand washings to remove it.  It protects the skin really well.<br />I also coat my feet in this and place a pair of socks on overnight and it leaves my feet soft and smooth and its also cheaper than buying foot lotion and smells better.<br />Overall it's a product that can have many uses if you make the mistake of purchasing for the wrong hair type and don't want to waste it.

I have naturally thik/wavey hair and while I do use a lot of "African American" products on my hair, like relaxers and things of that nature which help quite a bit because I get a natural "fro" going on, this really just wasn't for me as it is just too thick and greasy for my hair texturing.  It's hard to review it past that and saying it's okay and giving it 3 stars for that as I just passed it on to a friend who can and will use it for her hair, she so far has been able to and likes it; but for me this is a no go.

This can be used for women and men because I use this on my son's very low cut hair and this has helped him from getting those annoying dry spots in his head that are clearly visible. This product helps nourishes your scalp without clogging up your hair follicles. I have also used the balm to add on the tips of my hair after washing it so that I can brush it through as I blow dry it and this helps from damaging my already dry and brittle hair.<br /><br />Great Product for your hair and The Therapy Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm helps combats dry hair and helps prevent your hair from having the frizzes. You will love this nourshing balm,I know I do!

review/summary: This is HAIR GREASE; All the gold container clear products are for black people!
review/text: I don't know why CLEAR won't just say that the GOLD LINE is for black people.  At the store, all the gold products are with the black hair products and the other products are with caucasian hair products.<br /><br />Anyway, as for hair grease, it is no better than any other hair grease on the market.  For oiling the scalp, I like this CLEAR product better:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9G0">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce</a><br /><br />This particular product moisturized the scalp well and does not have an overwhelming smell.  I would purchase the Hair Oil over the container grease though.

review/summary: Adds something that the competition doesn't...
review/text: SCALP and HAIR therapy...nourishing balm.  Plenty of products like it on the market.  But this one really adds something.  It nourishes the scalp so much that its overwhelmed with nourishment and becomes dry and itchy.  So, not a great product in that aspect.<br /><br />As far as the hair nourishment - it's designed for African American hair, and it's not a big glop of goo when used appropriately.  It works to soften the hair, but no better or worse than the competition.  (But it doesn't lead to dandruff like the competition, so it hits an average 3-star.<br /><br />If you haven't had success with other hair/scalp treatments, you could give this stuff a try.  But if you're happy with what you're using, this stuff isn't going to provide anything better.

review/summary: Ethnic Product only
review/text: This product is not for White or Asian hair.  It's a very heavy product that stays in the hair for several days.  It leaves the hair a little greasy feeling, but not too bad.  I couldn't stand it in my hair, but that because I'm Asian and I should never have put it in my hair in the first place, but I made the same mistake as many others on here.  There is nothing that says it's an ethnic product.  I wish it did.  Even if they didn't want to advertise it as such, they could have put that vital bit of information in the instructions.  Oh, yeah - what instructions?  There is absolutely no intructions for use on this product.  I know because I looked...without any instructions, I used it like a conditioner and regretted it for the 3 days it took for it to come out of my hair.  After I put it on, I quickly realized it was not what I wanted and washed my hair with shampoo 3 more times, it wouldn't come out.  I kept washing my hair and it still took about 3 days before it finally all came out.  For the right hair - this is probably a good thing.  For me, it was horrible.  I do like the smell - it has a very pleasant smell and probably is a very good product for ethnic hair.  This is why I gave it 3 stars.  I think the product is good - it just obviously needs better labeling and some instructions.

review/summary: Greasy
review/text: This stuff has as its first ingredient petrolatum, which certainly sounds like a petroleum product. Then comes mineral oil and then paraffin. After that comes palm oil and Shea butter. So ultra Shea would seem like a misnomer. I would call it ultra grease. It is extreme hard to wash out and of you have fine hair like me, the last thing you want is greasy flat hair. Won't use this product, although it might keep my squeaky car door from squeaking.

review/summary: One Swell Soup - thanks to Amazon!
review/text: Campbell's Cream of Shrimp Soup has been a staple in my pantry for decades.  It was an easy starting point for all kinds of lovely seafood soups and sauces for nights when I was desperate for something fast and delicious.  Over the past few months, one supermarked chain after another in my area stopped carrying it. Totally unavailable, even by special order.  I was getting desperate.  So I tried Amazon.  Not only was it immediately available, the price including shipping was less than I had paid at the market.  Thank you Amazon - there will be shrimp and crab chowder for dinner tonight.

This is a significant savings over buying it at my local grocer as well. $1.99 per can versus $3.29 at the grocery-how great is that!

I use it as a stand a lone soup, and also as an item to add to other items, such as casseroles, and seafood chowder. When mixed with new england clam chowder, or lobster bisque, it is great!

review/summary: Merrick is one of the best...
review/text: I come from generations of veterinarians, vet technicians and professional dog trainers and breeders. Proper nutrition equals fewer vet visits and fewer lower vet bills. Since Vet medicine research in canine nutrition now proves that grain free, multiple protein, or varied proteins are the best nutrition for our furry friends I put my dogs on the grain free long long ago.I find Merrick is one of the very best. I realize a lot of people just present new foods to their dogs all at once. Never do that. Introduce ANY NEW FOOD in small amounts mixed with what the dog is accustomed to eating. Their digestion and their metabolism are unique, so just throwing a new food at them out of the blue they won't like it and can cause digestive distress. ALWAYS mix new food in with what their stomachs have been accustomed to.

The chunks in it are huge for a little dog so I cut them up, but he still would only sniff it and walk away.  Disappointing because I see now that they have the smaller cans I would have bought for him.  Not sure if the pieces in those are smaller as well, but it doesn't really matter.  He won't eat it.

review/text: This potato salad is 50% sauce now. The can I opened today consisted of a few potato slices swimming in an unappetizing amount of sauce. The label should at least warn you to drain this product well. Unfortunately, I was using it for a recipe (featured on the can) that featured smoked sausage and bbq sauce. It came out (per the maker's instructions) like bizarre soup. For three times the price of a can of sliced potatoes this should be better. The upside is maybe this will drive me to make the stuff myself.

Another item by the same manufacturer was shipped together with this one in one box with not enough packaging material to keep them from jostling about.<br /><br />NINE of the twelve cans are dented (two of the 4 bean salad cans are dented).<br /><br />The box had too much free room and one corner was open and had it needed to be shipped further, the contents would have fallen out.<br />As I said earlier, the product is good but order it by itself so a lazy packer doesn't just shove it into a box with other products with ONLY ONE strip of air pillow packaging material which was totally inadequate.<br /><br />I still haven't decided if I will order it again.  I had to discard one of the cans because both the top and bottom were dented so much a can opener could not be used.

review/summary: Doggie Crack!
review/text: I love the Plato line of products as they allow me to just mindlessly pick from the line and know that I am feeding something good to my dog(s). As for "Smart Dog Snacks" with Ginkgo Biloba and DHA...I'd better watch out, because my dogs love these treats so much that the treats just may make them smart enough to figure out how to open the "treat cabinet" take the container down and unscrew the lid to help themselves!<br /><br />While the treats themselves look like beef jerky, they are made with all natural, organic ingredients. The dogs don't care what's in these treats, they just know they love them. As I am typing this they are both sitting at attention, staring at me and whimpering while trying to do the Jedi Mind Trick of "you want to give us more Smart Dog Snacks, pick up your hand from that keyboard and reach in the container and hand us more. Do it. Do it now."<br /><br />There's so much junk out there and plenty of junk food that claims to be natural (just like people food) but this stuff is the real deal. Much like the food that I feed to the humans in the family, I know what each of the ingredients are and love that the first two ingredients are duck and brown rice. There aren't cost cutting fillers in these treats; it's a straight up high quality product. As an aside, I've bought from the seller, The Whole Healthy Pet many times, and I am always impressed with the products they carry. Just as I know that I can trust the Plato brand, I know that if a product is being carried by The Whole Healthy Pet, then it is a high quality product and I feel like a good parent getting it for my dogs.

review/text: My beagle loves this treat.<br />The texture is like a cookie and is kind of perfect treat to break into pieces, stuff it in a kong toy etc.

review/text: I selected the Plato treats due to the natural ingredients. Wow, my pug Ponch LOVES them! I currently have a bag each of the duck, salmon and chicken. When we get home from our walk he runs straight to the kitchen and runs in circles waiting by the fridge for his treats! These are the only treats I'll buy.

review/summary: Plato duck "cookies"
review/text: My dog underwent allergy testing a month ago to determine why he's was so itchy and losing hair.  He's now having allergy shots and the vet recommended we limit his diet to duck and potato for now.<br /><br />I bought duck and potato biscuits at the pet store but there was nothing on the package that stated where this product was made; although my dog liked them, I was bothered that a smoke flavoring was obviously used.  Then I found duck jerky at the pet shop but it is made in China.  The store clerk said none of the customers had complained about it and my dog seems OK with them but I decided to look around<br /><br />I was relieved to find these duck treats as they are made in the U.S.  They arrived yesterday and as soon as I opened the bag, my dog was right there.  His eyes light up when he sees the blue bag and I call these his duck cookies.  My only wish is that these didn't have salt.<br /><br />Just wanted to alert people planning to order these - the first time I ordered these, I bought four bags and all of the bags were fine - however, the second time, I bought two bags and I just noticed that there were a number of strips in the bottom of the second bag that are covered in mold - I had to chuck the moldy ones in the trash (with my dog watching wide-eyed) - so I'm glad this is now available through the subscribe and save program - I hope ordering one bag at a time will avoid the risk of this happening again
