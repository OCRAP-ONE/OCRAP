review/summary: Awful!
review/text: This was a big waste of money, both for the product itself and because it ruined an entire pan of lasagne.  The noodles were no-boil (which generally I'm not a big fan of because they are still tough), but the convenience was great.  After baking the lasagne at 375 for one hour, the noodles were still very tough, yet at the same time they absolutely crumbled apart in your mouth and didn't act at all like a typical lasagne noodle.  Out of our family of four, only my husband was able to finish his serving, but he even admitted that he didn't like it.

review/summary: GF Lasagna not as firm as typical pasta
review/text: I make lasagna for our annual family gathering so I was excited that I found a GF  lasagna noodle so I could eat the same dish as the family. I typically pre-boil my noodles but the instructions on the rice noodles said no boiling was needed. So I made my recipe and refrigerated it for 2 days as usual. I cooked it for 50 min let it stand for 10 min before serving. I was disappointed that the texture was mushy - not the same firmness as the wheat pasta noodles. Perhaps it would have worked better if I made it immediately before cooking and cooked it for a shorter time.

review/text: I bought 3 lbs on sale for about half off. The thickness and dryness was nearly perfect for how I like my jerky.  The flavor was good however it is loaded with garlic.  I don't mind the flavor of garlic in moderation, but this has so much it sticks with you all day.  I went through one bag and gave away the other two.  If I was a big fan of garlic I would have given it a 4-5 star rating, but since the type was labeled "original" and not "garlic" it was an un-welcomed surprise.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: If you are one of the beef jerky lovers who really enjoys the soft tangyness of beef jerky that is most resembled in terriaki flavored beef jerky, you should know that it is extremely hard to find such kinds. Sometimes it's just sheer luck that you get a bag of the same texture you want. To me, I felt that this beef jerky wasn't as good as some of them but definitely better than a lot of the main brands out there. This bag, has a LOT of beef jerky, and it is somewhat soft. However, it isn't like chewy/tangy and is still a little dry. Some people like it, but to me the texture is not great. The flavor profile though is delicious.

review/summary: good Amazon value
review/text: whenever Amazon sells Jerky under $1 per ounce, I always like to sample it.  I recall seeing this brand at my local Target over $1.50 per ounce (BTW - Target's $1/oz house brand Pepper Jerky is great).  I tried Wild Ride's Peppered and Hickory, since sweeter flavored Jerky are rarely done right.  Peppered is always a safe flavor to try since few makers can screw that up, and this one did not disappoint - very nice balance of pepper and smoke without downing it in salt.  the Hickory tasted like pickled meat with a strong dill and parsley aftertaste, while being way too salty and moist.  both had about the same gristle percentage than that cheap import Amazon sells from World Kitchens Jerky.  If you like your Jerky drier, just leave it in the fridge in an open bag for a few days.  I'd call the Pepper a 3 star jerky, and the Hickory 2 star jerky, that both earn a bonus star as long as it's available under $1/oz.  One annoying thing about the package - the ingredients list is microscopic - sort of makes you wonder what they are hiding...

review/summary: Tender jerky in some bags not others
review/text: I really like the size of the pieces and the tenderness of the jerky I've had so far. I've only had one of the 4 packages that come in an order. I am not thrilled with the Teriyaki flavor but it's ok, not too salty. The sweet hot is really hot so beware. This brand is the first jerky I am willing to re-order, which says a lot. Usually I get grossed out by the amount of sinew in packaged jerky but I have not found much in this brand yet.<br /><br />Updating after opening all 4 bags that came in an order: 3 bags were good but the 4th bag was all gristle and fat. There was not one piece that was edible in it. So they definitely have a quality control problem. Pity, because the good pieces are quite good, though the teriyaki flavor is a bit chemical for me. Still better than most other jerky brands

The taste is alright, but I really would like to find jerky WITHOUT Nitrites or Nitrates. I've kept it in the fridge now for several months (i haven't had any mold issues) since I truly try to consume nitrites as little as possible, it will take a very long time to eat this or I'll end up trashing it. Please REVISE the description to be accurate! This brand DOES from my understanding have a truly natural version, that I cannot seem to find on Amazon.

review/summary: Too much grissle in this jerky
review/text: This is really tasty jerky and the price is right, but ~20-30% of the jerky strips in the bags I purchased contained some sort of "gum-like" inedible grissle that I end up spitting out.  I've bought 2 bags of this product approximately 30 days apart and both were like this.  I'll try one more bag for the reasons I cite above, but if the next one is like the 1st two, I'm going to stop buying this product.  It's a shame, because as I said, it really is tasty.<br /><br />UPDATE FEB 2010<br />OK ... I've kept my monthly subscription to this Jerky ...  What can I say ... Every 2nd or 3rd piece from the bags I've been delivered turns into a gum ball that I'm not willing to swallow, but it is just so darn tasty.  Dunno how long I'll stay with this, but for now ... I sort of look forward to the monthly delivery.

review/summary: Good price, OK quality
review/text: This jerky tastes okay, but it seems like this isn't made from the best quality meat.  I don't know if I got a bad batch, but all the jerky I ate had hard veins running through them. All in all, I would give 2.5 stars, but since I can't, and I don't like rounding up, I have to go with 2.<br /><br />PROS:<br />The Jerky is tender, but not overly tender.  It is a good consistancy (except for the occassional tough fiber running through them).<br /><br />CONS:<br />The quality of the meat was sub par, which says a lot, since you don't need the best cuts to make jerky (its basically dried ground meat).  As the other reviewers pointed out, the package says the beef could be from USA or from a variety of other countries.  I'm pretty certain mine didn't come from the US.<br /><br />NEUTRAL:<br />The flavor was okay.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either.  There are many other jerkys out there that have outstanding flavor.

review/text: While "Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips" do have a good Hickory taste and are very tender (per treated), they are also fairly salty and leave a lot of "gristle" in your mouth. I also like that it doesn't have MSG (I'm alergic) but am disapointed that meat likely comes from outside the USA.<br /><br />On taste alone, my family is split on this jerky with 2 of us liking it (me and my son) and two of us not (my wife and daughter). We all like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPDOI">Wild Bill's Hickory Smoked Jerky, 6.5-Ounce Package (Pack of 4)</a>.<br /><br />I will not likely buy this brand again, even if it is on sale.

review/text: I have bought from this seller before and had no problems.  This last order I opened before I went on vacation for two weeks.  The texture of the beef jerky was different in this order than the ones that I had bought before.  After returning from vacation, when I opened the package, there was a very non-pleasant odor.  Upon inspecting the jerky, I found that several pieces contained mold on them.  What I have now is over a half pound of very expensive dog treats. While I would be willing to try this product again, as I have bought it before and this is the first problem I have had, there is no easy way of contacting the seller. The product is also listed as non-returnable, so while my dog is extremely happy - I am not.

review/text: This is really good jerky. The pieces are nice and thick and have just enough gristle in it to leave you with something to chew for a while. That's half the reason I like jerky. This actually helps the bag last longer since you don't rush right onto the next piece! It has a barbeque coating with a good flavor and a semi-spicy after bite. The pieces are thick enough that they don't disintegrate in the bag so that the last half of the bag isn't smaller "crumbs". I'd buy this again and as a matter of fact I think I will right now!

review/summary: Yummy!  Wild Ride Hickory is my favorite!
review/text: I'm hesitant to give this too good of a review, because I don't want the whole world buying it and then the price goes up.  BUT, this jerky is truly the best.  I've found that all the Wild Ride Jerky is fresh and easy to chew...it is very tender.  Hickory is by far the best Wild Ride flavor and I would eat it over Jack Links everyday!  Don't listen to the idiots giving this bad reviews, saying that it was stale or moldy.  This is what happens when you leave any kind of jerky out for 2+ weeks people!  Any way, just thought I'd chime in with an honest review.  Hope you dig this jerky (and price) as much as I do!

review/summary: Mislabeled Dog Treats
review/text: The price is cheap for a reason. This is some of the toughest jerky that i've ever had, and I've been eating jerky for over 35 years. Too much dried fat to be able to pull the stuff apart with your teeth. Flavor was good on about 50% of the pieces. The others had little or none. I think this stuff would be much better suited as a dog treat for a small breed. For me, it's pretty awful.<br /><br />I also got a bag of the peppered type. That review is pending.

Altho I havent figured out how to change the flavors, Im sure its with Amazon and not the Wild Ride company. Wouldnt bother either of us to get the same but would love to try all the flavors. Got a great deal and very happy with the quality and amount! Very tender, great flavor and filling as a snack! Husband is looking forward to baseball season to finally have some great jerky to snack on during the games! Recommend to all and makes a great gift that keeps giving!

review/text: Store-bought jerky tends to be an excellent source of jaw exercise, but this jerky reminds me much more of the products available at our local farmer's markets.  Excellent flavor (purchased the hickory, trying original next), and an awesome price for such large qauntity.  It's nice to see actual texture and strip size variations, vs. the new "pressed square beef-like product" now being sold as jerky in many bags.<br /><br />My fiance mentioned upon trying her first piece that it doesn't taste like store-bought.  I recommend this if you're a jerky fanatic struggling to find a good price/quality ratio!

Nice salty taste, thicker strips, tender (for Jerky) texture. The one pound size is a great value too.<br /><br />I ordered two more pounds of Cowboy Strips, Pepper and Original right away.<br /><br />I hope you plan to continue to offer the 16oz bags. I will definately be a loyal customer.<br /><br />Thanks for a great product!

The beef jerky was very tender. I know some might like that, but I like it a little rough. That's how beef jerky is supposed to be. The flavor was also really bad, but that is probably from the mold. I think the issue is the moisture. It makes it tender, but it is also leading to the mold issues a lot of people are experiencing. I won't order this brand again, which is a shame because it was a great price for the amount of jerky.

review/summary: Tender as promised, but more salt and gristle than bargained for
review/text: By now I've eaten half the bag so I know what's in here. Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store-bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.<br /><br />Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other brands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other brands, like they use lower quality jerky.<br /><br />Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other brands, even when you factor in the low price. There are similarly priced brands that are of higher quality and lower sodium content. I don't know why they sell so well. Personally my next bulk order beef jerky will be with someone else.

It arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and it tastes good.  But, it's not "all-natural with no chemical preservatives" unless you consider sodium nitrite and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil to fall under that description.  I would consider ordering it again if it weren't for the artificial ingredients.<br /><br />How do they get away with suggesting that there are no artificial preservatives (sodium nitrite) in this stuff?  Sodium nitrite has been linked to migraines and colon cancer and has been used as a poison in larger quantities.

review/summary: Gnaw yourself off a chunk
review/text: When I first encountered these Cowboy Strips I as a bit confused. Were they in fact made of beef or cowboy? Since cannibalism hasn't generally been in practice for quite some time (and even when it was, only by savages of the worst sort), I felt it was quite likely that the 'beef' mentioned in the title was the meat source, but it wasn't out of the realm of possibility to believe these to be beef flavored COWBOY strips made from real life cowboys. That thought caused my stomach to turn, and because I take great pride in leading a cannibalism free lifestyle, I decided it might be wise to contact the manufacturers of WILD RIDE just to double check--similarly I once contacted the makers of the very confusingly named 'chicken of the sea' brand tuna fish to see if it was chicken or fish; quite an important distinction! Better safe than sorry over having broken my nearly 30 year streak of cannibalism avoidance in one fell swoop, I gave WILD RIDE a call!<br /><br />Thankfully, WILD RIDE confirmed that this was in fact BEEF jerky, and that the Cowboy reference in the title was just an adjective explaining the sort of jerky it is: long, thin strips that are chewable, soft, and very, very tasty. I suggested that they rename it "Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips (NOT MADE FROM COWBOYS. NO COWBOYS INJURED IN THE MAKING OF THIS JERKY)" and they agreed such a change could potentially be useful. Much obliged for their assistance in understanding their product and their intentions (after all if they WERE selling COWBOY jerky, it might call into question what sort of operation they run, and if they are in-fact a Zombie enterprise!) I was able to enjoy all four bags of this jerky in about 30 minutes. Wishing I had more, I took a stroll to the outhouse because I suddenly wasn't feeling that well, and the next thirty minutes I spent thinking about what a great movie you could make about a Zombie owned corporation selling COWBOY JERKY to the unknowing public. I couldn't decide if I'd prefer to have Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal play the protagonist (or possibly pair them up!) or if the ending would involve a nuclear warhead wiping out the zombies or just let Chuck and Stev-o whack them apart with machetes, but at least these unanswered questions successfully distracted me from the 3.1 magnitude earthquake that was shaking the entire outhouse.<br /><br />So put your mind at ease: these are BEEF strips made in the cowboy fashion, and they're very, very tasty!

review/text: It's great-tasting jerky, but if you're trying to avoid sweets, you might want to steer clear of this.  A one-ounce serving has seven grams of sugar.  Seven grams is almost a quarter of an ounce.  So a quarter of this product's weight comes from sugar.  Not exactly what you'd expect from a dried beef snack, but not much different from several other brands.  In fact, most popular brands have 5 or more grams of sugar per ounce.  If you don't mind the sugar, go for it!

The texture of the beef is dry and mealy with almost a powdery quality to it.  Not moist, not tender, not flavorful, just disgusting.

review/summary: Beef Jerky
review/text: The Jerky had a nice, seasoned flavor to it, but I did not really enjoy the consistency and texture of it.  Rather than being chewy like other jerky I eat, it was much more crumbly.  Another reviewer mentioned it, but I thought that I would try it myself because I enjoy trying new things.  Not sure that I would recommend it to another jerky aficionado, but I have 3 more bags to eat and the flavor of the meat is good.

review/summary: Tender jerky - who knew?!
review/text: I prefer jerky on the tender side, so I really enjoyed the original Wild Ride natural style, but I also don't have any hangups about additives, so the new Cowboy Strips line totally blows away the flavor of the bigger brands I'm used to; same tenderness as the organic Wild Ride stuff, but with even more taste.  And if you haven't tried the Pepper yet, you're missing out!

review/summary: probably not from the Texas Ranch ...
review/text: Jim Davis may have been a Texas Rancher but the beef is sourced from "USA or Uruguay or New Zealand or Australia and further processed in USA" the flavor is overpowering, which I guess I should have expected from "hickory" but it doesn't taste like hickory smoke to me, it tastes like corn syrup (or maybe that's the hydrolyzed soy protein?) it's got enough hydrogenated this-and-that to fuel the Hindenburg. It's also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it. That doesn't really bother me so much, but it's definitely not "naturally tender" meat. This stuff is marginally edible but I wouldn't buy it again. As noted the claims of "no nitrites" in the description are false: Beef, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Soy protein, Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed and Soy Oil, Caramel Color), Water, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Soy and Corn Protein, Salt with Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (Cottonseed, Soybean) added), Dehydrated Garlic, Black Pepper, Curing Salt (Salt, Sodium Nitrite).

review/summary: Must be fine print in the contract......
review/text: I stopped buying Beef Jerky to avoid the preservatives, Nitrates/Nitrites etc.  Thinking I found one without, I purchased this product after reading the words "all natural" in the product description.  Now that it has arrived, I found Sodium nitrite is listed on the package. Also, I might mention that after the blurb about the "Texas Rancher" looking for something better, I wasn't expecting the advisory on the bag that the Beef was not only sourced in the USA, but in Uruguay, New Zealand or Austrailia. Oh well, a guy can dream.<br /><br />Tastes pretty good if you close your eyes.

review/summary: Beef jerky as it ought to be
review/text: This is real beef jerky that tastes like meat, has good texture and is fun to snack on. I order several packages to come monthly on a subscription basis as my kids and I love this healthy snack.  You know the stuff they sell at 7-11 they claim is beef jerky?  Well, this is how this one is different:<br /><br />1. The meat has great texture.  It is chewy, not brittle. You tear bites off with your teeth.<br />2. The quality of the meat itself is quite good. Not too many fatty pieces - it tastes like beef, not chemicals.<br />3. Unless you order teriyaki, the jerky is not sweet. Original flavor is just a tad spicy, but tolerable for kids. It's what we always get.<br />4. It does not have an infinite shelf life.  I found it go bad within a month or two. Bad for nuclear winter. Great for a healthy snack.  :-)<br /><br />I love the little packages inside the big one. The jerky stays fresh longer.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Pretty Good, but not Perfect
review/text: I bought this out of curiosity and out of the fact that I was just craving some jerky. The original flavor has a mild peppery taste to it and it's really tasty. It's mostly tender, but there are some strips of meat that have beef tendons, making the strips really hard to chew. Yes, there does seem to be some sort of "grit" in the beef jerky, but I'm not really too bothered by it. The other thing I don't like about this is that there are sometimes (just sometimes) strips of meat that have no flavor. But overall, I think this was a pretty good buy. I might buy it again, but only after I try some other brands.

Some pieces were almost "pre-chewed" in texture while others were so tough and full of gristle you couldn't eat them.<br /><br />The smell was just foul. I ordered the Teriyaki flavor and have never smelled anything like this before. It smelled rotten, rancid. The smell clung to your hands.<br /><br />There was a thick grease on each piece. I've never had jerky that was so greasy.<br /><br />I am feeding the strips I didn't eat, that would be almost the whole bag, to my dog. She likes them and hasn't gotten sick, yet.<br /><br />I've never left a harsh review before but this product was so beyond bad I had to be brutally honest. I'm sure there are people who love this product but I am not one of them.

review/summary: The best jerky!
review/text: This is the best jeky I've had. It's so good that I've setup an automatic shipment every two months. I ran into this product in Barstow, CA at a T/A stop. I decided to give it a try since the clerk stated that it was the best jerky she had ever tasted. She was right, it was excellent and made for a delicious snack enroute to Las Vegas. The jerky isn't hard, but not really soft either. Just a nice balance of texture. The heat comes on slow and takes a few pieces to really be felt, but the sweetness of the jerky is just right, so TASTY! Give this jerky a try, it's wonderful that these come in 1lb bags. Anything smaller and I think I would end up eating a bag a day.

review/text: I gotta say..... I enjoyed this bag of jerky. I ordered the sweet and hot and it was just as good as any other beef jerky brand I have ever had. Was it greasy? Yeah, a bit. Not any more or less than others. It was moist and tender more than greasy. Did it have fat on it? Yeah. A few pieces, but honestly, those taste the best to me. I guess I like all kinds of beef jerky except for the dried out, harder than leather kinds. I don't mind having to chew, but I can't stand the type that is almost too hard to eat. This was not like that. It was moist, tender and juicy with some good flavor. I am getting it again. Might not be the best that is out there, but it is pretty good.

review/text: This is true jerky not the kind that looks stamped or processed. This being said because of the natural variances of beef some pieces are smaller or contain a trace of fat or may be grisly but this is not a common occurrence. I purchase 4 pkgs of this per month and have been for 8 months. In my opinion, this is the best out there for the price. Its consistent in quality and you get 16oz. I have tried all the flavors and my favorites are Hickory, Peppered and BBQ so this review will apply to these flavors.

review/summary: Very tasty, but goes moldy quickly.
review/text: The teriyaki jerky was very flavorful, not too sweet or salty; and pleasantly chewy too, as opposed to the dry/stringy stuff I've tried elsewhere. The price was reasonable. My main problem is that several bags went moldy within weeks. Several other buyers have the same complaint. The first time I thought it came that way and it slipped by me. I checked as the other bags arrived, and saw them quickly turn fuzzy. I realized I'd have to eat it all within a week or two or throw it out once it starts to go bad. It may be moot, since it's been discontinued as of March 2011. I don't mind the additives so much, but would  appreciate if (assuming they bring it back) the stuff could keep a bit longer.

review/summary: Pretty good jerky.
review/text: This jerky was decent.  The softness of the pieces were in general pretty good, a little on the hard time sometimes but overall soft enough to chew comfortably.  They do vary a little bit within the bag so some pieces may be a bit too hard, but usually they don't get too soft.  The Sweet and Hot flavor tasted pretty good; so did the Teriyaki.  I'd recommend both!

review/text: Do not buy Wild Ride Beef Jerky. I purchased two bags of this jerky and they both ended up in the trash. I know Beef Jerky is supposed to be somewhat jerky but Wild Ride takes it to another level. Half the pieces are not edible. Maybe they should advertise this as bubble gum instead of jerky? The taste is OK, average at best. I think the only good thing about this product is the price. It is cheaper than most of the other brands out there. However, if price is what you're going for, go chew on some spare tires that are in the junkyard. What is sad is that rubber tires are probably more chewable than Wild Ridge Beef Jerky. Seriously, don't buy this brand.
