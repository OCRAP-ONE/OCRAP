review/summary: One of the best KIND varieties
review/text: Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow me to review the different KIND flavors individually, so I have to do them all in this review.<br /><br />I picked up a box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio and Cranberry Almond a few weeks back when Amazon was doing another one of their KIND promotions. Among the varieties of KIND bars I've tried over the last few months, the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio ones are easily my favorite in the whole line. They aren't overly sweet, and the variety of flavors in this version is excellent. While the pomegranate doesn't stand out much, the pistachio is definitely there as a nice subtle aftertaste.<br /><br />The Cranberry Almond, while still enjoyable, is a bit lower on my list - with nothing else to balance the flavors out, the cranberry flavor comes across a but too strong and tangy (though some might actually appreciate this).<br /><br />While I don't think these are meant to be more than snack/dessert bars (as opposed to meal replacements like with Clif of Powerbars), they certainly tide me over for at least an hour or two until I can eat a proper meal.

review/summary: Damp & chewy
review/text: I purchase Kind bars from my retailer every day and was trying to save a few dollars. These bars arrived in a damaged carton that appeared to have experienced excessive moisture. The bars had a weird "melted" texture and were not up to standard. I would absolutely not reorder them from this source.

review/summary: Very delicious
review/text: I was really surprise about the taste. It was very delicious. You can really taste the pomegranate, blueberry and pistachio. No kidding. I love each one of those and to be combined in one great snack, that's so KIND :) Oh! The antioxidants is a plus. The reason I only give it four star is because it is high in calories and sugar. Other than that, I definitely would buy this again and recommend it. I just ordered another flavor too.

review/summary: A Nutty Brick
review/text: Taste is a personal issue so I won't comment on that.  Just be advised that compared to the Fruit and Nut variety which, if you hold one sideways, will actually slowly fold over, these are thicker and MUCH more solid.  If you have sensitive or loose teeth or maybe dentures, be forewarned.  You should take your bites with your molars or break off a piece by hand just to make sure your chompers can handle it.  I apologize to any dentists financially harmed by this review.

review/summary: Delicious & Healthy!
review/text: I have tried a number of the Kind bars at this point because I have basically fallen in love with their line of products. It started with a Cranberry Almond one from Starbucks and since then, I have started buying several boxes every month. I don't like dark chocolate very much but thought I would give the Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate bar a try this time around.  I'm glad I did! Delicious and not at all bitter like I expected. It will be the perfect late afternoon snack for those days that I am craving sugar and/or chocolate at work.  Overall though, I like the Cranberry Almond the best and repeatedly go back to it as a staple for those times I skipped breakfast, need a snack, I'm on the road, etc. The Madagascar Vanilla is very good as is the Pomegranate Blueberry. Not so thrilled with the Mango and Apricot versions.  I've shopped around locally and online and Amazon seems to be the best place to buy them in terms of price, especially if you put them on Subscription. Kind's line of Grains is also good... The Maple Walnut is perfect heated in the microwave like oatmeal.  Strong excellent flavor and loaded with healthy grains, nuts, etc. Overall, I have been very pleased with Kind and will continue to buy their products as long as they remain available.

review/summary: KIND PLUS Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew Bars
review/text: This review is for the DARK CHOCOLATE CHERRY CASHEW flavor only....these are so good that I had to quit buying them so often because I would eat the whole box in 2 days! These are as good as candy bars. They DO NOT taste like any sort of "healthy" snack bar or anything. Now, some of the other flavors do and I think some of them are gross but this flavor is like eating a dang Chunky candy bar or something. Seriously, they are so good. They are really crumbly though so don't eat them in your jammies watching TV late at night (guilty!) or you will wake up covered in chocolate. :) But if you like nutty chocolate bars you will love these and you won't feel as guilty as if you were eating chocolate candy...but you won't be able to tell that you aren't!

review/text: I have tried almost all of the Kind bars.  They are all very delicious<br />and filling.  They are low in sodium and a lot the fat they contain<br />is the good kind (from nuts).  My husband is not crazy about nuts in<br />food but loves this Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew,which I think is much<br />better to satisfy his sweet tooth than a candy bar. Hope Amazon continues<br />to sell them because I can not find them in the store.

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: The flavor of these is definitely what stands out immediately to me. Most healthy snack bars have either an unappetizing or bland flavor. The flavor of these is bold and the textures are great. The chewiness of the cranberries mixed with the crunchiness of the whole nuts makes for a great combination. They also are healthy for you and pretty filling. Great snack to give you energy for exercising while also helping you keep your food intake down.

review/summary: Balanced, satisfying, and not too sweet!
review/text: These bars are great if you are sensitive to sugar. I have a hard time eating things that are hight in carbs with very little fat or protein. These bars are very well balance for an energy bar and I've never had a problem eating them. They taste very fresh and not as processed as most bars. They seem to be made of whole ingredients that you can see in each bite. They aren't too sweet and won't make your blood sugar hit the roof only to crash shortly after. They provide steady hunger relief. The flavors are wonderful. I love the peanut butter chocolate and the dark chocolate cherry cashew.

review/summary: New and NOT Improved
review/text: I saw people here complaining that the formula changed, but it seemed the same to me. Then recently I bought one that tasted awful. I figured it was me - maybe I had a cold coming on or something changed my taste buds for the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the good news is I can now find them at airports and everywhere. The bad news is that I've thrown away most of them half eaten as they almost taste "off" like they've gone bad. Very disappointed - I used to travel with 5 or 6 of these in my suitcase at all times. Hopefully they do something to revive their previous quality. Sometimes growth is painful.<br /><br />Someone post a review if they get better - until then I'm not buying any overly expensive and inedible bars. :(

review/summary: Break out the Beano/Peanut Bar w/Protein Powder Aftertaste
review/text: On the plus side they do fill you up & are packed with protein, filling & gluten free. On the downside - unless your idea of tasty is protein powder, I'd choose a handful of nuts versus this bar. Also you may want to consider Beano before eating these bars!!!<br /><br />LOVE the Almond Coconut KIND bars. Love the dark chocolate peanut butter ones, though more peanut than actual peanut butter. Taste somewhat similar to a healthy Baby Ruth. These Macadamia, Almond, Walnut bars have an initial odd protein powder aftertaste (though I don't think there's any in them). Once you keep eating it the initial taste goes away. I question why they would incorporate an odd taste when full of nuts that are protein packed. What's been added to make my tastebuds cringe at the unsavory taste? Peanut flavor outweighs the any flavor of other nuts once past the Protein Powder flavor. Barely a hint of macadamia nut flavor exists, though a promise of macadamia is what swayed me to order. All in all - would have been fantastic if able to elmininate the offputting protein powder taste. Wanted a tasty replacement for unhealthier counterparts. Unfortunately these failed to do the trick for me.<br /><br />A fan of the Almond & Coconut ones cause those have a great taste. These are off my list of future items to order.

review/text: I heard about this bars on QVC thought I could get a better price on Amazon & I did.  These taste so good, I like that they are all natural, they are so chewy.  While I was eating one,they were so fresh that they started bending in my hand.  I gave them to some of my co-workers to taste & they already want to order some.  Wouldn't hesitate to buy if you like a chewy, great tasting bar if you want something less chewy try the blueberry, pomagranite pistachio.  I'll be ordering more

review/summary: All natural and all fun!
review/text: Kind bars are not only all natural but gluten free as well! They are a great tasting snack (can be a meal replacement), that are filling and available in a variety of flavors. And yes - these are made in the US of A. So, you don't have to worry about contamination.<br /><br />I have a personal preference against peanuts and unfortunately that limits your selection but there are still quite a few options. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is my favorite since it not only is all healthy nuts (no peanuts!) but also includes a vegetarian source of Omega 3 - flax seeds.<br /><br />Our four year old loves these bars as well and that makes these truly special (as part of what I can assure you is a very small list of healthy foods!) Amazon's price on these is the best!

review/text: I love the Kind Almond coconut bars so I decided to try the peanut butter dark chocolate.  It arrived in a box of 12 and all appear fresh.  The bars are both gooey and crunchy.  It is tastey but not as good as the almond coconut.  Very peanutty with a little but of nice dark chocolate.  I like that it is higher protein and that I get to feel like a I had a candy bar but without the crash of eating way too much sugar.  This bar is good but not my favorite

review/summary: The best KIND bars!
review/text: This is far and away my favorite of the KIND bars. They aren't sticky like some of them, and they don't just seem like another combination of almonds and fruit, like many of them seem to be. The peanut butter taste makes these really different from the others, and the drizzled dark chocolate is such a great addition. These are prone to becoming melty, though, so I keep them in my desk instead of a backpack or pocket. These are also hard to find in stores around me, so being able to get a box at a time is nice.

You can actually recognize what you are eating.  There are whole macadamia nuts in the bar.  They really do not taste like any other gluten-free bars that I have tried.  The KIND bars are so much better!  My absolute favorite is the Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew!  I buy several of those every time that I go to Kroger or Whole Foods.

review/summary: Dark Choc is the dominant flavor; lots of crunch and chewiness
review/text: While the bar does contain a lot of peanuts, the peanuts are not the dominant flavor and neither are the cherries. Each ingredient is noticeable, but in the same way that one instrument is noticeable in an orchestra--they all play well together. What I like most about this bar is the dark chocolate and the texture. The bar is satisfyingly chewy with crunch from the peanuts and macadamia nuts, etc.  I was leery of this bar because I don't like chocolate covered cherries and thought it might have that flavor, but the cherry isn't overpowering and the bar isn't sickeningly sweet. It comes across like a somewhat healthy but flavor-rich treat for adults, not a bland granola bar or a kid's candy bar. Just ordered more on subscription.

review/summary: Not as good as they used to be
review/text: Agree with previous reviewer -- these used to be fantastic, now just OK. Still my favorite energy bar, but as with others they have added cheap peanuts to most of the flavors. For those of us with peanut allergies, that's a real problem. I used to be able to eat most of the flavors, now there are just a few without peanuts. Last few months bars taste much more cardboardy than before -- they used to taste like fresh nuts & dried fruit.

review/text: I was looking for a low carb bar that tasted good and had a higher protein content. This KIND bar was perfect with 10g protein/bar and only 15g of carbs and it tastes absolutely delicious! I like the fact that it has a lot of nuts (which their good fats) which helps it break down slower and more evenly so that you don't get hungry as quick and your body gets to absorb the nutrients more evenly. I bought the high protein KIND bard with the dark chocolate as well but this Almond Walnut Macadamia one tastes better. I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Good for you, tasty, but gooey
review/text: I really like these KIND bars. They're tasty, they're light, and they're good for you.<br /><br />The bars I'm reviewing are Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio. They really don't taste like any of those, they taste like an almond bar with various bits of indistinguishable fruit bits. Here are the ingredients, with the titled ingredients in all caps: Almonds, blueberry pieces (BLUEBERRY, apple, and plum puree), raw sugar, glycerol, citrus fiber, cashews, honey, raisins, glucose, POMEGRANATE, crisp rice, chicory fiber, PISTACHIOS, soy lecithin, natural flavors. The ingredients are always listed in descending order of how much is included, and KIND pulled a fast one by calling their "blueberry pieces" a separate ingredient, since it's really just apple puree. By my math guesstimate, there is less than 5% of Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio in the whole bar.<br /><br />Basically, this tasted like an almond bar. My advice is to read the ingredients, and expect it to taste like what's in the ingredients, and not go by what the title is on these bars.<br /><br />They're also really gooey. These are probably the stickiest bars I've ever had. I never pick them up with my hands, but I eat them out of the plastic.<br /><br />Also, I've ordered about ten of these boxes off of Amazon, and one box was rock hard. Not this one, but another kind. So if your box is hard as a rock, then just order another one, and odds are it will be okay.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Good for you<br />+Lots of natural ingredients<br />+One bar is a good snack (not too sweet, not too small, just right)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The ingredients on the title of the bar misrepresent the actual ingredients<br />-Very gooey and sticky. You won't be able to touch them with your hands<br />-From my experience, 10% of the boxes have bars that are hard as rocks

review/summary: Good but maybe my package was old.
review/text: I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.

review/summary: Taste great, but way overpriced for the size and ingredients.
review/text: I must admit I like them, and they are a healthy alternative to a candy bar.  But at about $1.50 each for a very small light bar, they're too expensive for most.  Honey, nuts, and a few pieces of dried fruit shouldn't cost that much.  A competitor may come along hopefully with a better value.

review/text: I do like the taste of these bars, however, do plan to get sticky when eating.  These stick to the plastic pouch and are difficult to get out, especially if you eat them while bike riding, running or working out.  You end up with a mess on your hands.  Refrigerating before eating may help, but may also lead to tooth loss.  These are my thoughts!

review/summary: Reminds me of Christmas time when I was a girl. . .
review/text: I couldn't believe my luck. This little nut bar was included in my variety pack of these yummy Kind bars that I had ordered from Amazon last month. The taste and texture of this nut bar is the exact same taste as the beloved "no bake fruit cake" that my Nana made us when I was a little girl back in the 50s and 60s. It must be the dates and the particular kind of nuts because it tickles my taste buds in just such a way as to send me back years ago. I thank you Kind bar makers as being genius in your combinations of ingredients. I love these things... Love, love, love. I have just recently made an order with Amazon for a box of 12 of these things... and just when I remembered a book I wanted and decided to add that to my order... gosh, well, I goofed up and I hope that Amazon figures it out for me just in time because if I get all 24 of these nut bars I am in real trouble. I will eat them till they're gone. So, please, cross my fingers Amazon does their usual magic and gets my order just right! I have been invited to "Like" them on my Facebook page, but then I don't go there often and... well, if I tell everyone, then they may become hard to find in the future... sorta like telling everyone where your favorite fishing hole is and then not being able to go there because it's so crowded.<br /><br />Computers are so picky!  I offered to write a review of a different flavor of this Kind bar and it told me that only one review per product per customer... but I could edit my review! So, here I am. Back again to further praise and describe what has become my favorite snack food. They are so filling though, you have to watch it because it becomes a meal substitute and then your friends think you're no fun cause you won't eat with them! You're already full! The protein in these bars make them ideal for trail food, however, if you don't have the teeth for nuts, stay away. This last bar I decided I'd praise is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNANSO">KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>. I found them in my local grocery store but they often run out and that's what sent me to Amazon for a check on their availability. Yum! Lucky me! So, I'm out. I ate all I ordered last month and I'm daydreaming of them right now. Should've ordered them a week ago so I wouldn't be out now. These dark chocolate bars are so delicious I can conjure up the taste and sensation right now because. . . now here's the heaven part of this daydream. . .they taste like Baby Ruth candy bars from when I would a youth!  Yum, yum, yum.<br /><br />Gotta love it, guilt free candy! But, wait, everyone, it is NOT guilt free if you make it an extra snack, but instead make it part of your meal planning day. The nutrition and calorie info is printed on each bar and if you buy them in the carton, then the info is even easier to read.

It's also not as caustic as Mountain Dew or Pepsi Max is, at least to my pallet.  Just a clean flavor, but not as light as flavored water.  No caffeine is a plus as well.  Yummy.

review/text: I received a gift of Tchibo Mellow Roast from a friend in Hesperia, CA about two years ago and I've been hooked ever since.<br /><br />This German coffee is rich, smooth, and delicious. Sadly, it's very difficult to find in the USA.<br /><br />Although I've bought it at European Market in Chattanooga, Tennessee, it's so popular they can't keep it on the shelf.  Many times I'll drive there, only to find an empty display where the product should be.  Wasted time and gas.<br /><br />When I saw this product on Amazon, I nearly fell out of my chair.  Finally, my favorite brand of coffee as close as my fingertips on Amazon.com.  No more trips across town to an unreliable retailer.<br /><br />I just ordered two 4-packs (ASIN: B000S54760).  Not only is it the lowest price I've seen, the Free Super Saver Shipping makes it the best deal on the market.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon, for carrying my favorite coffee!

review/summary: The best green tea in a bag I have found
review/text: This tea, in a silken bag, is high-quality, small, whole-leaf tea, and has a fragrant, fresh foliage taste.  None of the off/fulsome taste in many senchas, and you can taste all the different elements of tea.  Almost floral, even though no flowers are apparently added.  The bag can be steeped twice, if desired.  This tea is hard to find.  Thanks, Amazon, for carrying it, even if sporadically.<br /><br />From my earlier review:<br /><br />Most bagged tea is almost by definition not of the best quality, because the little pile of tiny pieces, or even powder, protected only by porous paper and exposed to the air, has a large surface area and is quickly oxidized. The more subtle aromatics are gone in a day or two, once the seal on the box is broken.<br /><br />These Tradition whole leaf teas are each sealed in an individual plastic packet and the leaves, although, not really "whole," are much larger than most bagged tea and a beautifully preserved green leaf. The well-stuffed bags appear to be made of silk, no staples, hard to tear. One bag really can be used for more than one cup. And the taste and aroma is more fragrant than almost any green tea I've tried, including some pricey premium whole leaf teas. I love this tea. Their Oolong tea is pretty good, too, lower on the fermentation scale than many, but good. I'd avoid the jasmine green, as it's fine, but the flowery fragrance of the straight green is enough for me -- the jasmine seems like overkill, almost like perfume.

review/text: ingredients:  Coconut juice, sugar, polysorbate 60, salt, citric acid, mono and diglycerides, propylene glycol, alginate, sorbitan monosterate, sugar gum and locust bean gum.<br /><br />I had not known what the ingredients in this were and that was foolish of me.  I was looking ONLY for creamed coconut with nothing else added, (the white creamed meat).  However, this is a very thick, very sugary-sweet syrup.  You have to pay attention to taste coconut.  So, I'll only be able to use about 1/2 a teaspoon a day and have enough now to last an entire lifetime.<br /><br />Though I'd wanted the 'butter' or 'paste' and was upset at first, I discovered that this tastes great on cream of wheat or even oatmeal, just a teaspoon at a time!  Really spiffs up the taste and flavor!<br /><br />(I did order Kevala Coconut Butter 16oz after receiving this too.)<br /><br />This was delivered VERY fast...the next day!

review/text: Just a quick comment on this very good and easy to prep cookie mix. These cookies do not have the same appearance during baking that tollhouse cookies from scratch have and it's easy to think that they need to bake longer than the instructions suggest (when removed at appointed time, they seem too soft to be considered fully baked). Trust the instructions and not your instincts...soft cookies firm up nicely on cooling, while overbaking results in disappointingly hardened cookies.

review/text: I have been using this mix for years and have tried many others.  This is by far the best mix out there for chocolate chip cookies, it has the right texture, it doesn't taste artificial in any way and the combination of brown sugar and butter along with the ghirardelli chips is fantastic.  I don't even make them from scratch because this is just as good and easier (at least to me) and I always get compliments on them when I bake some up to share.  Recently all my stores stopped carrying this and I was very upset.  I ordered from a bulk by the case place online but Amazon has the same thing for almost $10 less and free shipping, I am thrilled!

review/summary: Dangerous...
review/text: I'm a bit of a cooking snob and love the very labor-intensive but rewarding Choc. Chip cookie recipe from Cooks' Illustrated.  Seriously- it's dangerous (to your waistline).  What elevates that recipe above all others is the toffee base you make with browned butter.  If you have the time and patience, you'll be rewarded.<br /><br />So I was apprehensive when a co-worker was selling this Ghirardelli cookie as a school fund-raiser for her child at $4.50/box.  But I've enjoyed Ghirardelli's triple chocolate brownie mix (no scratch recipe comes close) and I owed this friend a favor.  With the exception of the browned butter toffee notes of the C.I. "scratch" recipe, these cookies (the large size batch) were nearly identical with a fraction of the labor.  I had to fight off the kids for a second cookie.<br /><br />I bought this mix on Amazon at $33/case with free Super Saver Shipping and now it's down to ~$27/case of 12.  Time to buy another case... then hit the gym.<br /><br />I'm thinking that for my next batch, I'll brown half the butter before mixing it in and see if I can pass them off as the "scratch" recipe.<br /><br />Like the Ghirardelli triple chocolate brownie mix, this cookie mix is impossible to find in stores.  Costco has the brownie mix.  If I want to really impress someone with those brownies, I put in a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and slather them with a rich ganache that has a pinch of cayenne.

review/summary: Don't tell my husband...
review/text: My husband luvs chocolate chip cookies and has been hinting real hard for me to make them for him. Well I got a 4 month old right now & don't have the time or inclination to make them from scratch. I have tried other mixes in the past but they where just so-so in taste. These cookies came out tasting like the kind you pay extra for fresh from the bakery! Perfect amount of chocolates and the texture is just right.<br /><br />The Hubsster was pleasantly surprised when he saw these babies cooling on the stove during the week. He made groceries this weekend and bought me extra flower and eggs.. uh,oh!! I just don't have the heart to tell him they aren't 100% homemade.. Oh well, I'll make a pie or something with the extra ingredients this weekend but for the time being, his weekly backed cookies are coming out of this awesome box!

review/text: Quick and easy to make these are better than homemade!  Just add 1 stick of butter and one egg to the mix to make the best  chocolate chip cookies ever. They are soft and chewy and full of real Ghiradelli chocolate chips. I  couldn't find this mix in my local store and like having the mixes on hand to take care of my chocolate craving.

review/summary: THE ABSOLUTE BEST!
review/text: I mean delicious!  When you first open the box, the aroma smells divine. Inhale. I couldn't bake a cookie as good from scratch, but anyway, you'll think they are from scratch, and so will anyone you feed them to.  I like to use unsalted butter, with the one egg the directions call for.  They bake up soft in the center and crispy around the edges. Don't overbake. Pull them out when they still look a little underdone in the center and the edges are just slightly golden brown.  They are done.  Just need to cool. If you overbake, they will get too hard when cooled....I don't mean crispy, I mean hard.  They have the perfect amount of those scrumptous Ghiradelli chocolate chips. Sometimes, I add toasted pecans and most times, I don't. They don't even need nuts, they're so good.<br /><br />They are "dangerous", but I always have them on hand.  I make up a batch of the dough, put it onto parchment paper and roll it into one big log, wrap in foil, and freeze.  I slice and bake, as many..or few, as we want.<br /><br />Amazon's price is great.  They are 3.99 a box in my area supermarkets.  When I first saw the box at the grocery store, I thought they were a little pricey, but  I've tried the Betty Crocker  mix, Duncan Hines, the way overpriced (and definitely not worth it) Barefoot Contessa, as well as most store brands.  No comparison.  With the exception of the Barefoot Contessa, this is the most expensive cookie mix on my supermarket shelves.  They are worth every penny.

review/text: I LOVE this cookie mix.  My son is allergic to dairy and eggs, so we make it using Fleischman's Unsalted Margarine and Egg Replacer because it is actually dairy free!  Works Great!!  The cookies are delicious.  I was so upset when my local supermarket stopped carrying them (and in fact, almost panicked, but was relieved to see them here online).  My son (11yo) makes them on his own, so I need to keep them stocked.

review/summary: better than from scratch!
review/text: I have been searching for years for a better recipe than this box mix for standard chocolate chip cookies and I cannot find one. This is hands down the best chocolate chip cookie on the planet. I pride myself on baking everything from scratch but this silly mix cannot be beat. I've tried. The one grocery store in my state that carried it was bought out by a different company and although they sell the other Ghiradelli mixes, they wont carry the cookie mix. I found it on Amazon a few years back even cheaper than in the store and I havent looked back since. Trust me...you wont be dissappointed and you can tell everyone its your own secret recipe :-) they will all be fooled.

I don't understand why because they have lots of space for the brownie mixes.<br />Let's make sure that Ghirardelli doesn't stop making the mix!

review/summary: By FAR the best box of cookie mix
review/text: I only wish I could purchase this.  Years ago it was taken off store shelves, and no one could tell me why.  I suppose certain products are just more popular due to overuse and a consumer fear of trying something new (seems to be commonplace, as a lot of higher quality products keep disappearing off store shelves).  I was hoping at least Amazon would have some, but no.<br /><br />To any consumers out there, I can bake just about anything, I make fantastic cookies on my own.  All other store brands save this one, and ONLY this one, pale in comparison to my homemade cookies.  These are like the perfect balance of goowiness and crunch.  The flavour is a subtle vanilla, subtle sweet, extremely subtle salty: a magnificent balance few cookie makers understand.  I only wish this were available and pushed, as all other store bought brands are like deformed stepchildren compared to this beautiful golden child of near perfection.

review/summary: best cookie mix out there
review/text: This is the best cookie mix available. The second best, in my opinion, is Betty Crocker's chocolate chip. There is something about the Ghirardelli, almost like a hint of toffee in the batter, which makes it unique. I add tons of oatmeal and sometimes nuts and still make/bake the same and they come out perfect everytime. I like my cookies soft, so put them in for 10-11 minutes. My mom likes them well cooked, so 12-13 for her. So fast and easy!

review/text: I grew up with home made toll house cookies. My mother never used a package mix in her life and I've always done the same. We're Toll House Cookie snobs.<br />Last year, my mother passed away and Christmas was hard. I just didn't have the enthusiasm to bake. One of my sons bought this mix, added walnuts and made cookies. What a surprise. They were/are absolutely great. If they aren't as good as home made, I couldn't tell it and the convenience makes them taste even better. If my mom were here, I believe she'd agree. Home made taste in less time than driving to the store for packaged cookies. We're all so busy, start a tradition with your own family. You won't be sorry.

review/summary: WOW! IDENTICAL TO FROM-SCRATCH!
review/text: I was honestly prepared to hate this mix. So many things I've purchased with raving amazon reviews just almost always over-hyped. NOT THESE!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I'm not a non-baker, nor am I at all new to cooking. I'm not a professional but I've already long-ago found a recipe that gets me a perfectly chewy and delicious chocolate chip cookie (That recipe is the chocolate chip cookie recipe on joyofbaking dot com btw if you're wondering).<br />However with the rising cost of ingredients that are in a good chocolate chip cookie, flour, the chips, brown sugar, white sugar, pure vanilla, making things from scratch compared to a mix  just isn't all that economical anymore.<br /><br />Which is why I was open to making cookies from a mix if I were to MIRACULOUSLY find a packaged mix that not only tasted as good as my homemade cookies, but was cheaper as well. I tried one mix that I purchased from a save-a-lot and it was absolutely DISGUSTING!<br /><br />I came across this product on amazon first and read the raving reviews, but I thought "$3.25 for a box mix? No Thank You!"<br />I know from experience that sometimes Amazon's grocery prices are almost always more expensive than my local walmart's (yes, even with subscribe and save) so I looked for it at my walmart, it wasn't there.<br />A few weeks later I came across it without even looking for it. and LOOKY HERE!, FOR ONLY 2.28!<br /><br />Few days later, added a stick of butter and an egg to a full box and what I got was a cookie that was NOT ONLY about the same price or cheaper as making my own from scratch, AND faster, BUT JUST AS DELICOUS. Moist, chewy, deliciousness I tell you!<br /><br />I got about 20 fairly large cookies from one box. For me, the amount of chips were SLIGHTLY too much. But that's coming from someone who only uses less than 1/3rd of the 12 ounce chocolate chip bag when making my half-batch of cookies. The amount of chips will probably be perfect for most. I just made 3 cookies to start and then balled up the rest of the dough and froze it so next time I want some It'll be just a little thawing and 10 minutes in the oven away.<br /><br />Anyway, if you can't find the mix in your local stores, it's not cheaper than scratch getting the mix here on amazon, but it sure would be more convenient, not to mention just as good!

review/text: I've been taste-testing cookies for more than 75 years, and this chocolate chip cookie mix is the absolute best I've ever tasted.  When the grocery stores in this area stopped carrying them, I was really bummed.  After 4 months of my whining because I had to resort to a scratch recipe that was good but not as good as the Ghirardelli mix, my husband  suggested that I try the internet. Eureka! My baking life is complete once more!  I ordered a case.  It's a small thing I suppose, but finding them on the net just made my day!  Joan

review/summary: Great baking time saver!
review/text: This product is a great time saver when your recipe asks for chopped Macadamia nuts! I am not as hesitant to make certain recipes now that I can make them in less time using the chopped nuts. I am glad to have found this on Amazon as I looked for it everywhere locally and could only find it occasionally and at a much higher price.<br /><br />I highly recommend this item to anyone who does a lot of baking and wants to spend less time chopping!

review/summary: Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Baking Pieces
review/text: Great idea selling already chopped Mac. Nuts.  In the past I purchased whole nuts then proceeded to try and chop them ... somewhat difficult.  They taste great in cookies because the pieces are not too small. The 6oz bag size is also good because most recipes call for 3oz so easy measuring too just use half the bag! Very happy with the product!

review/summary: Excellent product for baking
review/text: This is the best product for baking.  Nuts are chopped to the right size for adding to all of your baked items, cookies, cakes, pies, quick bread, muffins, etc. and for any recipe that calls for nuts.  This product saves me lots of time when I am baking and need nuts.  No more messy nut dust from chopping.  I purchase 2 - 6 packs and freeze them until I need them.  I have purchased these for the last two years and use them for everything that calls for nuts.  They are good to just snack on as well. - Enjoy !!!!!

review/summary: Nuts about the Macadamia pieces
review/text: Macadamias are hard to chop without a lot of "chatter". This product is perfect for places where you need chopped macadamias and cheaper here than anywhere else I have found.

review/summary: A fairly good deal
review/text: After unable to find Macadamia nuts in a few of my local supermarkets, I decided to go on amazon to look for them. The price was fairly reasonable, as it (macadamia was named as one of the most expensive nut in the world!) was the equivalent price for a bag of other nuts(almonds, pecans, and etc) at my local supermarket. The packaging of the nuts were good and they were fairly fresh. However, there were some problems as well. The picture on amazon gave a picture that made it look more full, when it's really 1/4 of the amount of nuts you see in the picture (the world of advertising). I was a little disappointed to rip open the box and not see what I thought (although it did state 6 ounces, but I could not mentally picture it). The nuts were nicely roasted, but there were quite a few that were on the verge of burning. The nuts still tasted fine, but was not aesthetically pleasing in my white chocolate chip and macadamia nut cookie. In a whole, I would buy the product again. :)

review/summary: Skimped on the beans
review/text: I normally buy Del Monte whole green beans in the grocery store, but these were available via Subscribe & Save, so I ordered them figuring they wouldn't be all that different.<br /><br />They are VERY different.  More water than beans.  I have to cook two cans to get enough for one side dish for just the two of us.  As soon as the Del Monte beans are available I'm changing to them.

review/summary: Dented cans and stringy beans
review/text: E-V-E-R-Y can was dented.  Some had to be thrown out, as they were so badly dented we couldn't tell if they were spoiled or not.  I would like to have known in advance that these were factory seconds so I could choose whether or not I wanted to risk it.  Also, I love whole canned green beans, but these have a significant percentage of untrimmed stems and stringy beans.  I will go with a competitor in the future.
