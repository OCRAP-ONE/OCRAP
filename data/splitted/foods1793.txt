review/summary: Good cafe mocha, but "Chocolate Glazed Donut?" Come on!
review/text: It's not bad, but let's call it what it is: cafe mocha.  Calling it Chocolate Glazed Donut coffee is like what the yogurt companies do when their products aren't selling well, so they call "lime" something like "Mom's Key Lime Pie," or "vanilla" something like "Decadent Madagascar Vanilla Experience."  This coffee doesn't have a bad taste, but reminds me of putting a bit of chocolate sauce or syrup in my coffee.  What in it is reminiscent of "donut?"

review/text: I have owned a Kuerig machine since before they were even a known brand.  I have tried every flavor out there but I keep coming back to the Chocolate Glazed Donut - it has a rich, smooth taste that is not too bitter and not too sweet.  If you like medium roast, flavored coffee then try this one out!

review/text: What's not to love about a chocolate glazed donut... without all the fat and gluten? Well, don't get your hopes up that this will take you to that place of guiltless indulgence. However, it's still great coffee and has just a hit of chocolate scent to it.  I added sweetener, a little instant cocoa powder, and half-and-half, and THEN it was more like a chocolate glazed donut.  Still good coffee, just wish the flavor was stronger.

I've purchased many flavors to determine what he likes best.  This is one of his favorites.  It isn't one that I particularly care for but I do love that it comes in a larger size than I can get from the manufacturer of my coffee machine.

review/summary: It's OK...just
review/text: This is one of those that I purchased based solely on the name (who doesn't like chocolate glazed doughnuts?) and my experience with their Cinnamon Roll coffee (which is very enjoyable).  The Chocolate Glazed Donut coffee from the Donut House Collection is okay but just barely.  It does have a chocolate doughnut taste but somehow the chocolate and coffee tastes seem "stratified" and not quite blended.  (I sometimes put chocolate in my coffee so the combination is not unusual to me.)  The coffee roast seems a trifle thin compared with others.  Overall, it is a fun novelty but not one that I would have to purchase again.

review/text: I'll admit that it's been a while since I've had real chocolate anything as far as donuts go, so I'm probably not the best person to tell you if this really tastes like a real chocolate glazed donut. I can tell you that it's pretty freaking delicious.<br /><br />I admit that I wasn't expecting much from the chocolate department. I've tried their basic donut house coffee, so I knew that at the very least I'd enjoy the base coffee flavor. While I'll admit that the chocolate flavor isn't nearly as strong as the scent makes it seem like it'd be, you can definitely taste the chocolate here. It's just strong enough to let you know it's there without being too strong. I will warn you, it is not the same flavor as drinking a coffee/expresso beverage with chocolate in it. If you go in here expecting that, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Other than that, this is something I really can't wait to try again and something I'll absolutely purchase again in the future.

review/text: Let me start off my review like I start off all my coffee reviews by saying I don't like coffee. However since I am on a diet and this is pretty much the only thing I can have in the morning I was going to suck it up and learn to love it. Well...Donut House Chocolate Glaze Donut was easy to LOVE. I absolutely LOVE this coffee. With just a couple packs of Truvia (I can't have creamer) it taste just like a Chocolate Glaze Donut. I was so surprised how good this coffee was; I would look forward to getting up in the morning so that I could make me a cup to take to work. I'm only 20 minutes away from where I work and the coffee it gone by the time I make it there; enough said.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this...
review/text: I really wanted to like this flavor and drank the first 4 before giving up.  The donut 'flavor' is chemical-ish and the chocolate is more of a smell than a taste.  It's not completely undrinkable (thus 2 stars, not 1); it just isn't good or enjoyable.  I wanted to try the Donut House Cinnamon Roll too, but am afraid of similar results.<br /><br />I am now looking for a K-Cup buddy to trade with or give away the balance.  I wish Green Mountain Coffee (makers of Donut House) offered small trial packs with 1 or 2 K-Cups of various flavors.  I bought the 24 pack online because I couldn't find it locally; perhaps that should have been a hint!<br /><br />As for recommendations, Green Mountain Coffee's breakfast blend and decaf are great!  GMC's Half-Cafe is EXCELLENT, just right for after dinner!

Does not taste like chocolate or donuts, kinda undescrible.  I still add sugar and lots of non-dairy creamer to sweeten it up.  Was hoping this "glazed donut" would have a sweet flavor that could stand on it's own without adding calories with these condiments.  Will not purchase again.

review/summary: The donut is subtle
review/text: Taste is subjective, but to speak for myself, I REALLY like this flavor.  It is an actual coffee K-cup, unlike some of the "mocha" K-cups that I've tried, which were instant coffee and cocoa mix in a cartridge.  There's actual coffee grounds and filter in this one.  To answer another poster's question, mine came with 24 (not 18) cups - and I do plan to purchase this again.  Probably in a couple of weeks.  (We just got our Keurig a few weeks ago, and I'm buying a bunch of different K-cups to see what we like.  Consequently, I have a huge stack of coffees to go through before my next purchase.)  I like this one - the chocolate taste is subtle: it's not a mocha, and to play off of the official description, it's not like a donut which has been dunked in coffee.  It's more like a regular (but tasty) coffee that a chocolate donut has been dunked in. You get a coffee taste, with a chocolate aftertaste... which tastes better than it sounds.

review/text: Bought this coffee for my husband,who likes chocolate flavored coffee, not knowing if he would like it, and yes he does.  In fact, I found that I like the sutble chocolate flavor especially with a chocolate raspberry or carmel flavored creamer.  Will definitely buy again.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033HPPIO">Donut House Collection Coffee, Chocolate Glazed Donut, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>

review/text: I tried writing a review previously but I focused on how recieving a bottle w a busted cap and dents on my product didnt make me super happy. I wasnt going to have a container once I took off the foil cause the cap was busted...so I got a plastic container and dumped syrup in there for storage. Tonight,  I made a mint julep w the syrup. Its wasnt a HORRIBLE drink, but its not a mint julep to me. It just didnt taste like the ones Ive had. Taste combined w a shabby bottle didnt work for me.

review/summary: Incredibly delicious!
review/text: Yes it's bright green, yes it is full of sugar, but by gum is this mint syrup delicious! Like several other reviewers, I grew up in Europe where this can be considered a fairly common drink. Most caf&eacute;s in France, Belgium and even Italy will carry a mint syrup, and no, they don't use it in coffee! Add a dash (or four) to cold water (flat or sparkling) and you have created what is easily one of the most refreshing drinks imaginable. The mint tastes is not overly sugary, making it excellent as a cocktail mixer/modifier (alcoholic or virgin). Use Teisseire mint syrup to add a punch in flavor and presentation!<br /><br />I highly recommend that you give this sirop de menthe a try!!

review/text: Teisseire is a French company that still makes the best syrups out there, with no nasty ingredients in them. High quality products for at least 20 years!<br /><br />Mint syrup is my favorite, and I used to drink a ton of it when I lived in Belgium and France. Add it to ice water or, even better, to sparkling water for delicious, refreshing soft drink. Highly recommended! And if you'd like to try another flavor, get the grenadine flavor (that one can be added to vanilla ice cream for a delicious treat).

review/text: We all love Teisseire syrups in our family. I grew up in France and my grand-mother used to serve me these drinks during summer. Now, my parents bring these when they come visit from France for my kids. I love that I can find the syrups on Amazon too as they're pretty heavy to carry in a luggage! My favorite flavors are mint, grenadine and anis. These are the classic flavors but the truth is that they are all amazing. All the fruity flavors are great: strawberry, red fruit, orange, lemon, etc...

review/summary: My dog loved this food!
review/text: I am a BzzAgent and recently received a coupon for a free bag of Bil-Jac Dog Food to try.  I have a VERY active 8 year old Labrador Retriever who is pretty spastic at times.  After eating Bil-Jac Large Breed Select Adult for several days, her attention span and energy levels seemed to be more evened out and her bowel movements were more compact as well.  From a human standpoint, the food didn't have that nasty dog food smell, so from that alone it seems like the quality of the ingredients was much higher than most other dog foods out there.  We did a challenge to see if our dog liked Bil-Jac better than the dog food we usually buy for her by setting out two dog bowls of food to see which one she preferred.  She sniffed both bowls and went right for the Bil-Jac.  This is significant because we put her usual food in her bowl and the Bil-Jac in the bowl that we usually give to our other dog (we have a side by side double bowl feeder).  She skipped right past her bowl (which she never does) to eat the Bil-Jac.  The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because it is significantly higher in price than the dog food we usually buy (we have two large Labrador Retrievers to feed), so dog food costs a small fortune for us already.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommend Bil-Jac.

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep.  My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs.  As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs.  Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic.  Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods.  This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat.  Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat.  A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke.  It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use.  Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business.  There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients.  I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.

review/summary: Clarification
review/text: Please note, Amazon did not incorrectly place this item in the "foods" section:  This is not just a mustard-flavored, or mustard-scented oil--it's actually the oil from mustard seeds, which have been safely consumed by people in India for thousands of years.<br /><br />The reason the label reads "for external use only" is due to an FDA regulation:  When the product is sold in the US, it must legally bear this label.<br /><br />This is exactly the same thing that has been used extensively in northern India for cooking for ages.  This very product ("KTC Pure Mustard Oil") is sold in many Indian groceries in the U.S.,  and everyone there will tell you that it's used for a cooking oil.  If you look on the back of the bottle you will see in the labeling "Manufactured by: KTC (Edibles) LTD."<br /><br /> Mustard oil is actually reputed to be particularly heart-healthy, and have a lower percentage of saturated fats than canola or other edible oil.  One note, it's always briefly heated to a very hot (almost smoking) point by Indian cooks right before using.  This is done to get rid of a raw taste that is considered not pleasant, and to achieve a nice mellow flavor.  Hope this info helps.

review/summary: Fast Shipping, Great Purchase!
review/text: I rated this item with 3 stars! W/ S&H it came out to $11.95. I received it in 3 days. The oil was warm from sitting in the mail truck. It would be helpful if KTC sold this size compatible with Membership Prime Free 2-Day Shipping. I am using the pure mustard oil for my damaged/ dry processed hair, so far so good, I used it once in a homemade Mayonnaise and egg hair conditioner concoction in which I left on my hair for 30 minutes, I haven't yet used it alone for the several hours overnight, after I rinsed my hair I put rosemary oil and the pure mustard oil on my hair when it was wet, it came out very soft with a mayonnaise odor. The mustard oil has a light scent similar to grapeseed oil - many reviews I read online stated it has a bad smell on your hair, this oil doesn't have much of scent at all. This was my first time ever purchasing and using pure mustard oil and by this brand so I can't be much help judging the quality of this particular brand of pure mustard oil. I probably would look into going to an Indian grocery store first for this product before purchasing it again from this seller.

review/summary: KTC  Mustard Oil  is not edible
review/text: Upon receiving the KTC mustard oil, we noticed that the label said for external use only.  As the product was listed with other "gourmet food items" we had assumed that this was a mustard flavored food oil.  Not a mustard Seed oil.  There is a big difference and one that could be dangerous if not noted.  The Amazon ad did not relate any warnings or ingredient list that I could find, that would have helped me avoid purchasing the wrong item.

Then it generally disappeared from our local supermarkets for no apparent reason, so I was thrilled to get it through Amazon.  Hint - if you get it and use it as a dip, make it a day ahead so the flavors marry.

review/summary: Cheese Garlic
review/text: I didn't know Gheese Garlic dressing was available on line. I was orginally was going to contact the Kraft people to complain that I could no longer find Cheese Garlic in the market where I shop. This is the only dresdsing my daughter, granddaughter will use. I went to four different markets trying to find this dressing and could not, so I panicked, thats when I decided to contact the Kraft people to complain. Thank God, Amazon popped up with the information telling me that I could order it on line. We were saved. Please don't discontinue this product. I even use it as a marinade for chicken. When my 22 year old granddaughter was 5 we took her out to eat, we all ordered salads, when the waitress asked my 5 year old granddauhter what dressing she wanted her answer was "Grandma's dressing (which was the Cheese Garlic. Now I have a 4 year old granddaugher that just loves it on her tomatoes. Thank you very much for such a great product.<br /><br />Sally Fraijo

review/summary: Still our favorite dressing!
review/text: I have no idea why Good Seasons does not put this in stores anymore.  It is still our favorite - better flavor than Italian - and not creamy like other cheese flavored dressings.  I double the vinegar (and use red wine vinegar) which makes it nice and tart.

review/summary: Love this...It's the Best
review/text: I'm really upset that the stores no longer carry the Cheese Garlic. Forget about following the recipe on the package.  I use mayo instead of oil and vinegar.  Just put in the amount of dressing mix you want in a jar, add some water to dissolve, then add mayonnaise. Dilute with more water until it's the consistency you want. I like it better this way..(you have to use real mayo...light or fat free makes it taste terrible.

review/text: I love this dressing but my local stores no longer carry it. I was very happy to find it on Amazon. I adjust the mix as follows: red wine vinegar to the "W" line, dump in the mix, then double the amount with oil. I chill it and drizzle it over sliced tomatoes and avocados with S&P. Yummy. I wish Good Seasons still made their dry Blue Cheese dressing. It made the best chip dip!

review/summary: THE BEST!
review/text: This is seriously the best cheese garlic salad dressing!!!!  I had this as a kid for as long as I remember.  I now serve this to my family.  It went off the market for a while and we were devastated.  I basically rationed what envelopes we had left.  If you want to make a yummy chicken dinner with it, melt 1 cube of butter and mix with 1 pkg. of the dry cheese garlic dressing.  Roll chicken breast in butter mixture then bread crumbs.  Salt and pepper and bake at 300 for 1 1/2 hours- 2 hours until chicken tests done.  We love this stuff.  It's fabulous on pasta salad or on a green salad.  I can now only buy it online.  We are this dressings biggest fans! Thank you Amazon!

I have also gotten the rib combos - very meaty and the smoke is perfect.  Considering shipping is included, these are nicely priced. I have sent Burgers ribs and combos to family members as gifts and all have raved about them.  I have not tried the hams, sausages, bacon etc just the BBQ sampler and the ribs so far.

review/text: These candies were bought and sent as a gift to a family member who loves chocolate straws.  When they were received by her, we realized that they were not "filled" with chocolate cream at all.  There was a "thread" of chocolate cream in this very hard candy.  Chocolate straws are crunchy and "filled" with chocolate.  Terrible, feel embaressed that I sent them. Now as far as packaging and shipping, great!  It was received when we were told it would be.

review/text: Wolfgang Puck's Chef's Reserve Colombian (Dark Roast) is basically what they said it will be. Dark roast, but not too strong. Acidity is on a low side, but with plenty of pleasant taste. At the same time you can drink this coffee black w/o the need for the sweetener and/or milk. This coffee is in European tradition and will please many people. I would recommend it after dinner, but not if you need a jolt to wake you up.

review/summary: My mom said this was not as flavorful as other "Extra Bolds"
review/text: This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:<br /><br />Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.<br /><br />There! Now you know.<br /><br />My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and she's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups she's tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. She's tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.

Bitter aftertaste, and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor. Smells great while brewing, but just does not live up to it in the cup.
