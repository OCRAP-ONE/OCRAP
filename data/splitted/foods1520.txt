review/summary: The BEST sugar replacement on the market!
review/text: I've been using Fat to Skinny Zero since it was first introduced. It's the first non-sugar sweetener that actually tastes like SUGAR! It's a remarkable product - I would not steer you wrong. There is absolutely NO AFTERTASTE! It doesn't give you a tummy ache like some sweetener products can, and the food prepared with it tastes like it was made with regular sugar. My mouth is SO HAPPY!<br /><br />I use it for candy, cream-cheese cake frosting, beverages, cakes, desserts - anywhere regular sugar can be used. I keep a bottle in my purse and use it on the road as well. (Don't leave home without it!) It's a keeper!

review/summary: My #1 Sweetener of choice
review/text: What a wonderful product! It's perfect to use in baking or anything you need to add sweetness to.  I am a diabetic, and like most folks had trouble controlling my blood sugar even with medication. That is until I found the low carbohydrate lifestyle of Fat to Skinny and the help of Fat to Skinny zero sweetener. I have almost made it to my goal weight, stabilized my blood sugar, come off of all my diabetes, cholesterol, and blood pressure medications all the while still getting to enjoy my desserts. How great is that!!  I notice no aftertaste but the best part no tummy issues that some sweeteners can have. I used to love to use Splendaï¿½ (or any of the store brands) in packets or bulk powder form, but unlike those this has no added fillers to add carbohydrates and to spike my blood sugar. This little bottle holds the equivalent of 6 lbs. of sugar and is so easy to just throw in my purse to take along with me. I would  recommend it to anyone if you are looking to reduce or replace sugar in your diet.

review/summary: I'm a believer!
review/text: Okay, I was very, very skeptical when I ordered this on the suggestion of a friend who swore it tasted just like real syrup. I've tried nearly all other commercial brands of sugar-free syrup and had come to the confident conclusion that there really was no such thing as a sugar-free syrup that actually tasted anything resembling the real thing.<br /><br />In fact, before my package arrived, I was already contemplating how I'd get rid of it all after what I anticipated would be a definite dissapointment (yet again) in taste.<br /><br />I'm very pleased to say that I'll be keeping every single bottle and will probably use it all up before the expiration, hoarding it away for myself like a pirate hoards treasure.<br /><br />It truly is, by far and away, the best sugar-free syrup I've ever had. It tastes almost exactly like the real thing, both in texture and flavor. Another perk of sugar-free syrup: Absolutely no annoying stickiness should I ever get overzealous in my pouring!<br /><br />At last my search is over! I'm one very happy camper and truly satisfied customer. Thanks so much, Joseph!!<br /><br />(Only one complaint: I wish, out of all the bottles, there was at least one equipped with a pour spout in the lid)

review/summary: Beware the maltitol sweetener...
review/text: I tried this syrup just to avoid all the calories in regular maple syrup. I used a moderate amount on my pancakes and thought it tasted pretty good. About an hour after eating, I began to paying the price for consuming a product containing maltitol as the sweetener. I've never had so much gas and intestinal discomfort (for about 8 hours). These are well known side-effects of consuming this sugar alcohol and I am quite surprised it's been mentioned in only 1 other review of this product on Amazon. Just Google "maltitol side effects" and you'll get the picture. In my opinion, this product should be not be sold until it is reformulated with another sweetener. There are much better sweeteners than maltitol.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I have been using Joseph's Lite Syrup for over a year, have introduced it to many of my friends and all who have tried it, love it. It's thick syrup with a real sugar/maple taste.<br /><br />After a local store dropped this product, I purchased two cases here through Amazon/factory direct for my friends and family. What I received is 12 leaking bottles with loose lids and 3 of them over half empty. I think Joseph's expects this because the outer of three shipping boxes was lined with a heavy plastic bag. The bottles read, refrigerate after opening, so for all I know, they are all spoiled.<br /><br />Joseph's has not responded to the E-mail I sent to their customer service and that is most frustrating.<br /><br />In summary, Great Product, but Joseph's doesn't care once they have your money.

review/summary: Type II diabetics beware!
review/text: I purchased this product shortly after being diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. I have to agree with the other reviewers concerning the taste and texture of this syrup - it's amazing! BUT, for those of us who follow a strict diet and have an understanding of the glycemic index - the maltitol syrup used in this product has a GI of 75 ( table sugar = 100 )- which means that a sharp rise in blood sugar can be noted after consuming even a normal serving size of this syrup. The first time I used it I was very upset by my blood sugar test results 2 hours after eating but attributed the rise to the sugar in the pancake mix. The second time I used it, I had the same result but this time there was no sugar in the french toast....... So if you are only trying to use this product to lose or control your WEIGHT, then I'd say go for it. But diabetics, be cautious, and check your blood sugar levels.

review/summary: Tastes great, but BEWARE!
review/text: This is easily the best tasting sugar free breakfast syrup I've ever had.  I couldn't really tell the difference between this and regular maple syrup.  The key to it is the sugar alcohol in it called maltitol.  It has nearly the same chemical structure as sucrose (table sugar), and almost the same amount of sweetness.  However, maltitol is not easily digested, and I paid the price for it.  Being the moron that I am, I decided to put a ton of this stuff on my Eggo's because it tasted so good.  However, not long afterwards, I developed the worse gas, bloating, and cramping that I've ever experienced, and it lasted for at least 6 hours.  This is a warning: CONSUME THIS SYRUP IN SMALL QUANTITIES!!!  They really should put a warning on the bottle.  Anyways, as far as taste goes, this get 5+ stars compared to other sugar free syrups, but it gets knocked a few stars because of the extreme intestinal discomfort it caused me.  So, once again, tastes great, but BEWARE!

review/text: This stuff is delicious. That said, there are other considerations. I had this on Eggo waffles for breakfast. It was all I could hope it to be. Then two hours later my stomach began to growl and roll and I developed cramps. I spent the next six hours running to the bathroom. It is sweetened with maltitol, which causes extreme gastric distress for some people. Check it out on Google. I guess I'm one of them. I waited three days and tried it again for lunch, thinking maybe it just didn't like an empty stomach. Same results. So if you are going to be "out and about" do NOT try this for the first time. Wait until you are at home all day. If it is agreeable with your digestive tract, it's as good as any sugared table syrup. I ended tossing the second bottle I bought in the trash.<br /><br />Terry

review/text: This product tastes good.  It is technically sugar free, but what it uses effects blood glucose.  It is in no way 0 net carb.  They use maltitol, which has 75% the glucose absorbtion of sugar.  This means, it isn't zero net carbs, but that the 9 carbs per serving are absorbed by the body as 6.75 net carbs.  If you are doing a low carb diet, 6.75 carbs is a lot.  That is fraud, and it isn't okay.  Stay away from this product, it is a lie.

As far as causing gas problems, well that depends on each individual. Some may have no discomfort what so ever, while others may need to avoid all sugar alcohols(because they all CAN cause gastrointestinal problems)

review/text: Unlike supermarket brand sugar-free maple syrups "Josephs" is made with natural maple flavorings and you can tell the difference.  It is the closest product to real maple syrup that I have found.  The only draw back is the maltitol.  Maltitol will cause gas, flatulence, and has a laxitive effect.

My husband and I first had it at the Original Pancake House in Falls Church, VA.  (We both follow a diabetic food plan.)  When we first tasted it, we grabbed the bottle to make sure that it was really sugar-free (it is!).  The consistency is rich and thick and the maple flavor tastes just like real maple syrup.  I don't know how they do it, but Josephs had made an amazing sugar-free syrup.  We buy it at the Original Pancake House or Whole Foods.

When I was unable to get Joseph's Syrup, I purchased Howard's that I had used in the past. Guess that the taste and texture of Joseph's totally spoiled me because Howard's tasted horrendous and the consistency was so watery that as soon as I was able to get Joseph's again, I tossed that in the trash. Also - Atkins Maple Syrup was DISGUSTING! That went down the drain right after the first mouthful!

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/text: This syrup is very tasty. However, it has a laxative effect on your body. Sugar alcohols, maltitol being one, leaves one gassy and in some cases with diarrhea. One morning I made pancakes for my family. My son had diarrhea, and me and my daughters had very bad gas. I said to myself, it must have been something that we ate. I narrowed it down to the syrup because we all ate it. I looked at the ingredients on it and decided to look up maltitol and it sure enough said that it is a sugar alcohol and can have a laxative effect on the body. So I never used it again. So if anyone experiences discomfort after eating this syrup then know it is the cause.

review/summary: WOW!!
review/text: I decided to try this syrup after reading other reviews hailing it as indistinguishable from real maple syrup. I expected it at best to have a noticeable after taste or less than palatable flavor, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it tastes EXACTLY like full force maple syrup, with no unpleasant flavors or after taste at all.  I highly recommend for people who are counting carbs for a diet plan, for people looking to reduce their sugar intake, or diabetics.  A+++ product

review/summary: watch your sugar alcohol!
review/text: Sugar alcohols (such as maltitol) have laxative properties.  If you are like my diabetic son (10yrs old), you pour a LOT of syrup on your waffles.  The result can be loose stools and stomach cramps.<br /><br />The taste is fine.

review/summary: Confusion on "sugar free" title
review/text: I didn't order this item after reading the ingredients.  It says "sugar-free" but the main ingredient is maltitol.  While, yes it isn't technically from sugar cane, it does has a glycemic index of practically the same amount.  So what's the point you might as well use real maple syrup...

review/summary: FINALLY!
review/text: I am a diabetic, and one of the things I really miss since starting a healthier, carb-and-calorie-counting lifestyle is the taste of real maple syrup. I've tried just about every major brand of sugar-free syrup, and none of them even come close. Most have a sort of odd, chemical aftertaste. There are half a dozen partially-empty bottles sugar-free syrup of different brands in my kitchen (OK, I need to clean!) that I just stopped using because they weren't good.<br /><br />Joseph's is the first sugar free syrup that tastes like real syrup. It has a thicker texture than genuine maple syrup - closer to honey or even molasses, really. In fact, if it's coming from the fridge, I'd suggest putting it in a small bowl or container and popping it in the microwave for a few seconds to make it thin enough to pour. But the taste is perfect. SO GOOD.<br /><br />I haven't had any of the stomach problems that some people have reported, but be aware that maltitol can cause difficulties for some people.<br /><br />I bought this on a whim at a discount store, and I couldn't be happier. Having good syrup again is like finally scratching an itch that I couldn't reach for a year. (OK now I sound like an addict.) But seriously, give this a try.

review/text: This is a fantastic syrup! It isn't really "no carb", but it is low carb (I believe the label says 9 carbs in 1/4 cup, vs. 39 carbs in other syrups). My dad is a diabetic & loves to have pancakes & french toast when the rest of us do, but has always taken only one. Now, with this product (which we think tastes exactly like full carb syrups), he is able to have 2 or 3 and not have to worry about his sugar going too high. Will definitely buy again!

review/text: MALTITOL. I had no idea what this meant when I poured it on my waffles about 1.5 hours before sitting an exam...... : | The syrup itself was surprisingly good though. It tastes just like regular maple syrup. I normally can't stand fake maple syrups, so, when I tried it, I really thought I'd lucked out. It's unfortunate that it contains this sugar alcohol though, as it apparently has a laxative effect on some people. So, if you're not sure if you're sensitive to it or not, make sure to only use a tiny bit at first and don't, excitedly thinking, 'So delicious! So few calories!,' dump it all over your breakfast like I did. D:

review/text: I bought this syrup from a local store and decided to try it. I liked the taste of the syrup. However, I had no idea that maltitol was going to cause me terrible discomfort soon. I didn't even have a full serving which is a 1/4 cup (I believe). After I looked up the ingredients and googled maltitol, I realized that it was the cause of ALL my intestinal discomfort that day. I felt terrible and was in pain. Needless to say, the bottle went straight to the trashcan. So, unless you know for sure that sugar alcohols don't bother you I wouldn't try it.

review/summary: I buy this by the case!
review/text: This is, by FAR, the best sugarfree syrup I've ever tried and I've tried them ALL, I think!  In fact it might be the best syrup, bar none, apart from pure maple syrup.  If you're doing low-carb, or diabetic, or just try to avoid sugar in general, this product is excellent.  Others I've tried have been either sickeningly sweet, artificial-tasting, gloppy, or too thin.  This is thick, luscious, and delicious!<br /><br />The ONE caveat is that it IS, as another reviewer has pointed out, a sugar alcohol (maltitol) and if used in too great a quantity may well cause "gastrointestinal distress" to put it nicely!<br /><br />I never have a problem with it when I stick to the recommended serving size of 1/4 cup - which doesn't SOUND like much but is very adequate for a serving of pancakes or waffles (low-carb for me please!) or added to recipes such as barbecue sauce or others requiring maple syrup.  I even use it to make a delicious pecan pie!

On the plus side, low carbin' can leave you a little blocky...this will cure that.<br /><br />Overall, if the low carb pancake was as close to real as this, we would all be eating low carb.

I made some French toast (of sorts) with my Julian's low carb bread and cautiously poured on the Joseph's sugar free maple syrup. Aside from pure maple syrup, this is the best tasting I have ever tried.  I suppose if you drank the whole bottle something might happen, but with a generous portion of syrup on 2 slices of french toast, I didn't have any side effects, intestinal or otherwise.  Highly recommended for low carb diets.

Hands down, this is the best sugar-free syrup I have ever tasted, and I think I have tried them all. Unlike other sugar-free syrups that are watery, this syrup is thick and has the butter flavor that I love. It reminds me of the Eggo buttery breakfast syrup I used before I was diagnosed as a diabetic. My only suggestion would be to add a squeeze cap. I took one from and old bottle of sugar-free syrup I had in the cabinet and switched it with the plain top that comes with the bottle. Now if I could just find and awesome low-carb waffle mix!!

review/summary: the best sugar-free brand!
review/text: I have tried several sugar free syrups (even Cracker Barrel's) and light syrups (Mrs. Butterworth's Light, Aunt Jemima Light) without much success.  They were all thin/watery with weak flavor compared to regular syrup, and not low enough in calories to make the switch worth it.  I spotted this syrup in a Whole Foods store. I hesitated to try it because it was very expensive, but I was desperate.  I paid $7.99 for a small bottle. After tasting it, I would not hesitate to pay even more!  This is hands down the best sugar-free syrup I have ever had.  It is thick, with a good flavor, and only 35 calories per serving. And, the serving size is the same as regular syrup (1 ounce, or about 1/4 cup).<br /><br />I bought this syrup to help me lose weight and eat healthier.  I have not encountered any of the side effects others have mentioned over the maltitol, but I also use this in moderation - pancakes and french toast are not exactly low-cal on their own!  This is still a very expensive product, but worth the cost for the quality.  I don't think I would use it as an alternative sweetener as suggested on the bottle; not with Splenda available, and significantly cheaper. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Best sugar free maple syrup- hands down. No comparison
review/text: If you need maple syrup for your breakfast French toast or pancakes, or for recipes- this syrup is the BEST sugar free option available. No need to try the others, this is the real deal. Very thick and tastes dead on to its original counterpart.

review/text: I've tried what it seems like an endless line of different brands of "sugar free" syrups at my store. I was about to give up and ordered a small bottle of this wonderful stuff. I don't use it often but it sure does help with my sweet tooth. I have yet to find the perfect low carb pancake mix that goes with it but I LOVE it with my banana and peanut butter treat! It doesn't have that funky after taste at all.

review/summary: Believe the hype! This is Great Stuff!
review/text: I have tried pretty much all the available brands of sugar free breakfast syrup. Joseph's is BY FAR the best I've ever come across. The flavor is indistinguishable from full sugar syrups and the texture is thick and rich. You do have to be careful. The syrup is so good and so low in calories, that it's easy to get carried away and as another reviewer reminded us, this product does contain Malitol, which has a pronounced laxative effect if too much is consumed in one setting.

review/summary: Fair Trade Sugar
review/text: Organic Sucanat is many levels above regular white granulated sugar. This sugar takes baking and tea drinking to new levels of pleasure.<br /><br />When holding this sugar in the palm of your hand, you will notice the irregularity of the crystals and the "dark brown sugar" color. This does have a flavor that is reminiscent of brown sugar and yet the texture is much more natural and the crystals take longer to melt on your tongue.<br /><br />Recently I've been discovering a variety of more natural sweeteners. This on is perfect for tea because it not only adds sweetness; it adds a caramel flavor to teas in which you use milk. There is a purity in the flavor and you feel better because you are supporting organic farms and keeping your body healthy.<br /><br />This is a one-for-one replacement for refined white or brown sugar.<br /><br />Sucanat is made from 100% certified organic sugar cane. The sugar cane is "green cut." This means the fields are not burned and the leaves and tops of the cane plant are left in the field. The sugar is minimally processed and once the sugar cane is harvested it is pressed to squeeze out all the cane juice. This juice is then clarified, filtered and evaporated. This helps to remove excess water. The syrup is then crystallized and a sugar with a molasses flavor is produced. There are also vitamins, minerals and trace elements from the sugar cane plant. One teaspoon of Sucanat contains 10mg of Potassium and 6mg of Calcium.<br /><br />If you are still using white sugar, try Sucanat. It might surprise you with added flavor, goodness and purity. I find the flavor to be superior to refined white sugar. This sugar will add a touch of caramel flavor to all your baking.<br /><br />If you are looking for an even deeper flavor for chocolate recipes, try Muscovado sugar. It has a rich flavor that can't be matched by any regular brown sugar you would find in your grocery store. With Muscovado and Sucanat, you can take your baking to the next level.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Glad I made the switch.
review/text: This is the best price anywhere, unless you're buying it in 25- or 50-pound bags. I parted ways with refined sugar a long time ago, and since raw honey doesn't suit every recipe for which sweetness is called, Sucanat fills the gap beautifully. I've been testing ice cream recipes and it really does contribute a rich, caramel flavour to every blend. None of us has noticed the typical sugar highs and lows with this product, but perhaps that is due at least in part to always accompanying it with plenty of good fats.<br /><br />One caveat, though, and it is absolutely not a strike against this product:  it won't make traditional caramel! Be forewarned. When heated and melted, it becomes molasses. I happen to like the bitter, smoky taste, but it didn't really suit the recipe. I'll just stick with its natural caramel qualities from now on.<br /><br />This small issue aside, it is a delicious, rich-tasting and high-quality product that will contribute a deep, full, warm taste and not just direct sweetness, to whatever you're cooking.

review/text: This sugar is healthier than the processed kind and super tasty.  Amazon offers it at an AWESOME price, but if you have a serious sweet tooth I would caution against purchasing it in such a large amount.  It is so good that it takes some constraint not to stir it into every cup of tea, bowl of oats, and picture of lemon aid.  Remember that is is STILL SUGAR and should be used sparingly!  There are healtier alternatives out there, but for that special cake or an occasional cup of hot cocoa this is my pick.

Based on prices for individual bags of this product, this is a good deal as well. I use this in lieu of white sugar, but often will just replace all of the white and brown in recipes with this (like cookies) and it seems to work well. Of course, it's only a better option than refined sugar and still should be used in moderation. It is definitely a different texture than white, refined sugar so if you aren't familiar with it, make sure to do some research. Good product, though. And it's Fair Trade Certified.

I love this stuff so am even happier that we are saving money and still able to enjoy organic sweeteners.<br /><br />I ordered the powdered sugar as well, VERY spendy locally.  Great deal here too.  I add just a little more liquid to my recipes to compensate for the absorbtion of the sucanant.  Great results.

I made blondie brownies with this sugar, and they came out rather dark - but the flavor was very good.  I highly recommend this as a natural sugar substitute.

review/summary: Bold and Mold
review/text: I admittedly liked this product.  People thinking "I like smoked salmon" may be thrown by this product at first, but think "jerky!!"  Very chewy: the larger pieces can give your jaw a good workout, and every once in awhile you hit a peppercorn which makes your eyes water (in a good way).  Good salmon flavor.  I would be a happy consumer except that I have run into moldy strips in two separate orders.  Got the 8 pak, and on pak #6, almost the entire contents were fuzzy.  An e-mail to the company got absolutely no response, but Amazon was kind enough to replace it in spite of it being a generally non-returnable item.  Unfortunately, the replacement jerky also had a white fuzzy mold pocket in one pak.  Not in every pak, but since you tend to chew jerky while busy doing something else (fishing, driving, whatever), it gave me the creeps knowing how little I looked at most of this stuff when shoving a strip "in between my cheek and gum."  Eat in good light and keep your eyes open.

review/text: This salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough, it is pretty much inedible.  And when you do painstakingly gnaw on it, it doesn't release much flavor, but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth.  I had the misfortune of ordering this, and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched, and I'm not sure what to do with them.  I even tried soaking the jerky, and tried boiling it with some macaroni, and NOTHING seems to soften this stuff up!  What a waste of money.  Go for some beef jerky instead, and if you need salmon, eat it fresh or canned.  This product is a joke.

review/text: I have ordered the SnackMasters Salmon Jerky a number of times and have never been disappointed with the quality.  Until today, my co-workers and I like to have a little salty treat in our otherwise very sugary snack station, so I have taken to ordering the jerky.  When the shipment arrived today we expected the same as we have had before, only this time it was AWFUL.  I have read others reviews stating the jerky was hard as a rock and thought they exaggerated for effect, I learned today they are not.  This will be the last time I order this product and I would hope that Amazon would take to providing a little better quality control on items like this.  It's all fun and games `til someone loses a tooth.

review/summary: shredded not jerky
review/text: taste is ok, once you scrape the mostly crumbs of what used to be jerky into your fingers; there are no strips, biggest piece about an inch, as though run over by car, so someone has to be doing this better than snackmasters

review/summary: Great product
review/text: SnackMasters Salmon Jerky is very nice. I have purchased it before in a national health food store, and sometimes it was very hard. The packages delivered from Amazon were perfect - not too soft and not too hard, just right.<br />The taste is what this jerky is all about, it does not have that fishy oily taste present in other products, just a burst of flavor that is finely balanced and long lasting.<br />Great product!

review/summary: Nice salmon jerky!
review/text: I was hesitating when I consider buying this jerky.  Somebody gave bad review of this product as dried out and brittle.  After I did a bit of homework on all salmon jerky available on market, I decided to give this one a try.  Today, I just received it and tasted it.  It is very yummy.  It is chewy but definitely not dried out and brittle. It is also a very good protein source, from the package, I see that out of 1 oz (28 gram), it has only 1 g of fat, 2 g of sugar, but has 16 g of protein - a super healthy food. This one is of original flavor.  I wish they have other flavor (like super spicy one so that it can last longer).  Anyway, I will reorder the salmon jerky after I finish this package.

review/text: Great flavor although the majority of the pieces were a little dry and brittle when I was expecting a more moist consistency.  Overall, pretty good product that I would buy again.
