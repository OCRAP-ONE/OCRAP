review/summary: Try before you buy
review/text: I personally enjoy this tea, but it is obvious that the pyramid series of teas finds many different tastebuds. My favorites are the white teas (blueberry/pomegranate and this one). I also like the green/mandarin/orange. Do yourself a favor and try a single box before ordering six boxes (even though the bulk order is a good deal). Once you have discovered your favorites, you can savor the tea and the money saved.

review/summary: Just ok, mostly weak.
review/text: This tea is just ok.  I had been searching around for a tea that would taste a bit like juice and ran into this at a store. A nice fruity iced tea on a summer day would have been nice but this has failed me. To be fair I gave it a try both hot and cold and if you like warm tea you will not be pleased as this tea is much weaker hot than cold. Tastes mostly like water the "flavor" is almost non-existant. I am not happy with this.

review/text: I love tea.  Hot or iced.  Sweetened or unsweetened.  My fave...peach iced tea.<br /><br />During the Summer, I was introduced to Teavana Youthberry but found it waaaay too pricey. And I also enjoy Harney and Sons tea in the silk sachets.  After browsing in the local market, I came across this tea (in a sachet) and couldn't wait to brew it. Suprisingly, it is very close to Teavana Youthberry. I was soooo excited. This tea is delicious! It's great with or without sweetener.

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: I'm a tea enthusiast, and after having an expensive peach white tea from a specialty tea shop, I was hooked on the combination.  After depleting my supply, I came across this Lipton Mango Peach at the grocery store and thought I would at least give it a go.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much, but this tea really did exeed my expectations!  I can't quite taste the mango, but the peach flavor is there.  The tea is light, and not overpowering (I'm not a fan of fruit teas that are so strong they mask the tea flavor).  I add a bit of stevia to sweeten, and I'm good to go!  It is a very smooth cup, and I find it relaxing.  It also makes a yummy iced tea!

review/summary: I don't care if it's white, black, or green - I like it
review/text: White tea, black tea, green tea -- I don't care what it is as long as it's very light tasting and doesn't taste like plain tea.  I didn't like tea AT ALL, but my recent acquisition of an espresso/coffee/tea machine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SH6UQ4">Kaldi S04 Single Cup Brewer, Blue/Silver</a> caused me to develop a passion for the Passion Fruit Tea which came with my Kaldi.  Those tea capsules aren't available locally, and are expensive as well, so I decided to try this Lipton Mango & Peach Tea.<br /><br />This is a very LIGHT refreshing tea.  It smells wonderful in the box. I like my tea weak and over ice, so I use one bag per 16 ounces of water, and I add 2 packets of artificial sweetener.  I think it's fantastic, and no matter if it's white, black, or green, it's probably better for me than a Diet Coke.

review/summary: don't be fooled -- this is NOT white tea!
review/text: Maybe I should have said "this is not 100% white tea." But then, so should Lipton have said just that. Even though it does not say so in the tea name, the sub-title name, or any of the information anywhere on the box EXCEPT the ingredients list in very very small type (had to get my reading glasses!) -- the second ingredient in this "white" tea is green tea.<br /><br />Why? Because white tea is very expensive. It is costly because it is hard, labor intensive work to harvest white tea. If they sold this product made completely out of white tea -- they would not make as much money.<br /><br />But then, they also would not be deceiving their customers. I drink white tea and rooibos red teas because they are naturally either caffeine free, or so low in caffeine that it doesn't give me the migraines which caffeine cause for me.<br /><br />Lipton's deception did cause a migraine. And they have permanently lost a customer because of their intentional deceit.<br /><br />All of the other major tea companies make sure their products are clearly labeled as "caffeine free," "contains caffeine," "naturally low in caffeine," "those sensitive to caffeine please read ingredients...."  But not Lipton.  They made these pretty little pyramid tea bags, but put the same old sad corporate ethics inside.

I've tried all the other flavors in the pyramid line, and really don't like them as much.  this one is my personal favorite!  it actually is out of stock here in LA - went everywhere to find it - it was the only one off the shelf everywhere i went.... was really going through withdrawal :)  glad to have found it again instock on amazon.

The other two mentioned above are excellent.  This sad comer is infused with a simply terrible fake peach flavor that is, to me, nauseating.  If you really like that sort of thing you might still try it. To me it tastes like the awful flavored Bigelow green tea series.

review/summary: A lovely tea
review/text: This was my first foray into white tea about a year or so ago. Ever since I tried this, I have been addicted to white tea. I am a big tea drinker (I try to drink at least three cups a day) so I've gone through plenty of boxes of many different flavors and types of tea. Without a doubt, this is one of my very favorites. The tea itself is very aromatic. As soon as you pour the water over the bag you are met with a delightful scent of peaches. As for the flavor, this is a quite subtle tea and that is exactly what I like about it. I've seen some negative reviews regarding the flavor--some people think it does not have enough--but I don't think this was meant to be an in-your-face kind of tea. I think it was meant to be more of a soothing tea, something calm and gentle almost. I know it really soothes me. Just opening the box and being hit with that scent of peach and mango always makes me smile. It's also incredibly smooth. I don't think I've ever had a smoother tea before, and that certainly adds to the soothing factor. Overall, I personally recommend this tea, but if you're worried about the taste and how you'd like the subtleness of it than I would recommend just getting a box to try instead of the 6 boxes I've seen Amazon offering. Enjoy!

review/summary: Smells Like Peach and Mango.  Tastes like Island.
review/text: The sweet aroma of this tea will entice your senses, only to disappoint your tastebuds with its bland flavor more reminicent of island driftwood than peach and mango.<br /><br />I enjoyed offering it to friends (to try and get rid of it) and watching their faces cringe as they tried to decipher the strange taste.  And as an island tea, it helped me imagine what it would be like to live on a deserted island with nothing good to drink.<br /><br />A close inspection of the ingredients reveals that it is actually part white tea and part green tea.  And while it smells like peach ring candy, it tastes nothing like fruit.  Thankfully, the unappealing flavor is subtle and weak.  If you do have the misfortune of trying this tea, it is much better iced than hot.  And take comfort in the fact that everything else you have the rest of the day will taste far better in comparison.

review/summary: Vivid Memories of Islands of Mango Peaches....
review/text: The tale had been around almost as long as time itself.  From Herodotus, to Prester John, to Juan Ponce de Leon, many a great man foretold of the legend of the mythical Fountain of Youth.  Our journey's, at the behest of that rotten scoundrel, Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, had taken us from the coast of Ethiopia during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, to the shores of Bimini, to the swampland of Florida.  Still, the mythical Fountain of Youth eluded us.<br /><br />However, it was during the great exploration during the spring of 1934, and a chance encounter with an village elder within the peaceful Arawak people of Hispaniola that we received our finest intel on the location of the elusive Fountain of Youth.  At first, we believed we lacked the communicative arts to converse with the village elder, until we located a young Arawak woman, who understood rudimentary Spanish, a truly coarse and barbaric language.  (Romance language nothing, as all knows the most romantic language of all being English, the language of Kings!)  Thankfully, Helmsman Constance was in the employ of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish.<br /><br />Helmsman Constance, as fine a helmsman and navigator in all all his Majesty's seas, was also a finely educated Cambridge gentleman with a truly exemplary ear for foreign languages.  Helmsman Constance considered himself fluent in the barbaric language of the Spaniards, much of it learned after a torrid love affair with Eulalia de Asis de la Piedad, daughter of Queen Isabella II of Spain, while she was married to Infante Antonio, Duke of Galliera.  (A true rogue, that Helmsman Constance).<br /><br />Helmsman Constance turned to the young Arawak woman and said, "Como el viejo, donde la fuente de la juventud es."<br /><br />The young Arawak woman turned to the elderly Arawak elder, listened contently and then said to Helmsman Constance, "&Eacute;l dice que, si la fuente de la juventud es lo que buscas, entonces tenga cuidado, porque es realmente peligroso, pero tiene que viajar al oeste, m&aacute;s all&aacute; del gran oc&eacute;ano occidental, por la legendaria isla de Fiji. S&oacute;lo entonces, una vez que usted bebe las aguas m&aacute;s puras de Fiji, se reciba su fuente de la juventud."<br /><br />Helmsman Constance turned to me and said, "The woman says, for the Fountain of Youth, we must find Fiji, and drink the water of Fiji so pure."<br /><br />With that the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish set a course, and began the daunting voyage ahead to truly the ends of the Earth.<br /><br />"Captain, if I may, permission to speak freely?", Boson's Mate Micklegal asked.<br /><br />"Granted.", I responded.<br /><br />"I don't have a good feeling about this Captain.  I can't explain it.  The boys have heard stories.  Stories of this island of Fiji.  They say a great Warlord is there.  One of them ancient warlords, you know, with.... special powers.  They call him, Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau.  Call him "The Centipede", because they say he moves silently and strikes painfully."<br /><br />"I hear your concerns, Boson's Mate Micklegal, and I share some of them.  But we are Englishmen, of the finest character.  We have honour, courage, and valour.  If Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford has asked this of us, then we must obey."  Boson's Mate Micklegal then pulled out his trusty kettle and brewed us a fine cup of Earl Grey.  (As all fine Englishmen know, Earl Grey is the the finest of all teas, "The Earl", is truly the tea of Kings.)<br /><br />We arrived on the the island of Fiji after many fortnights.  A most beautiful and stunning visage.  Such a tropical paradise, one cannot imagine how such a dastardly action, such as cannibalism, can exist in such a pristine and wonderful paradise.  But we came for the Fountain of Youth, the waters of Fiji.  You see friends, the waters of Fiji had been untouched by man, far from pollution, far from acid rain, far from industrial waste.  They say the waters of Fiji are drawn from an artesian aquifer, located at the very edge of a primitive rainforest, hundreds of miles away from the nearest continent.<br /><br />The wonderful aroma of Island Mango Peach... Recalls such vivid memories...<br /><br />As we traveled through the rainforest, being ever so careful to avoid "The Centipede", we were drawn in by the luscious scents of the mango's and peaches of the island.  Boson's Mate Micklegal made sure to gather these delicious fruits.  And then we saw a bright light... the Fountain of Youth it had to be!  We pushed through the dense vegetation and arrived at the natural artesian aquifer.<br /><br />There we saw "The Centipede", who appeared much younger and calm than we figured him to be.  He spoke with nary an accent, and in perfectly understandable English.  (Cannibalism aside, a non Englishman with such fine command of the language of Kings, deserves a frothy pint.)  "My friends, welcome to Fiji, and welcome to The Fountain of Youth.  You see, reality is a bit more complicated.  Some waters come right out of municipal reservoirs before they are "purified".  And even, "spring" water is affected by the earth's many pollutants as it bubbles to the surface.  Then there's Fiji water... uncontaminated and uncompromised.  Preserved and protected by its source and location, Fiji water's aquifer is in a virgin ecosystem at the edge of a primitive rainforest, a continent away from the nearest industrialized civilization.  Our rainfall is purified by equatorial winds after traveling thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean.  Winds that carry acid rain and pollutants to other parts of the planet just don't come our way."<br /><br />"But you can never remove the water from Fiji", he said, "For it is the lifeline of my people."  The Centipede offered us a few kilograms of mangos and peaches, which he humbly accepted.  He then offered us the bounty of a recent Dutch expedition, to which we politely accepted.<br /><br />Back on the ship, as in customary fashion, Boson's Mate Micklegal whipped up a fine cup of tea.  He mixed white tea leaves, green tea leaves in the essence of the island mangos and peaches and the result was mesmerizing, Boson's Mate Micklegal's finest creation to date.  We celebrated, as Boson's Mate Micklegal slipped below deck into the hold.  He pulled out the bottle of Glen Fiddych stored in the hold, took an enormous swig, and toasted himself.  However, in his drunken stupor, Boson's Mate Micklegal falsely believed the H.M.S. Peregrine was under attack by a Portuguese vessel, loaded the peaches and mangoes into the number 12 cannon, and fired away, awakening the entire ship.<br /><br />For breakfast, I asked Boson's Mate Micklegal for another cup of the fine tea from the day previous.  Confused, and knowing the lack of the delicious island peaches and mangoes, Boson's Mate Micklegal found Lemongrass and Leaves of Orange from our journey to New Zealand three months prior, and passed it off as the delicious Island Mango and Peach Tea.  As we were all hungover, we neary realized the difference!<br /><br />So to the hack's at Lipton, while the taste of this Island Mango and Peach tea is mightily unpleasant, the thought and memories it conjures, are truly unique.  All hail Lipton hack's!

review/summary: Yes, Virginia, was a very bad rabbit....
review/text: When the mailman came, I ran excitedly out to meet him in the yard.  Clad only in my fluffy lavendar slippers and a floral nightcoat...I am sure I was a ghastly sight...but I just couldnt wait one extra moment to finally get my hands on that rabbit!  I was so excited...whole fresh rabbit.  The glory of the purchase was stamped "fresh" all over the box in bright red ink, and the entire thing was wrapped in barbed wire.  "Interesting packaging", I thought...then thoughtlessly put my ponderings aside and brought my prize into the house.<br />  In truth, I nearly stumbled over the welcome mat as I hurried into the house with my extra special Amazon delivery!  Rabbit!  All mine!  How wonderful!  I hadnt had rabbit in years!<br />  With much ceremony, I sat down with a box cutter and began to open the box. Then suddenly this hairless, headless beast came flying out as if propelled by a spring.  It immediately landed on the table, and held up one of its forelegs. Although it no longer had paws, I got the distinct impression that the rabbit was flipping me off!  The irreverant beast was clear in its defiance.  Startled, I stepped back...I didnt quite know how to handle the situation.  I was quite frozen in shock.  The rabbit deftly kicked the box off the table and approached me with a confident swagger.  It seemed to be sizing me up.<br />  The next thing I knew, the rabbit had seized the box cutter from my trembling hand.  It weilded the blade with obvious expertise, waving it menacingly in front of my face.  I found myself completely immobilized with fear...a wave of morbid awareness drifted over me. There was nowhere to run.  Nowhere at all...<br />  The rabbit quickly stretched its naked, spindly legs and leapt from the table.  Within moments, it began to hurriedly ransack the house.  It spray-painted graffiti chickens all over my livingroom wall.  It broke into my safe and stole jewels and money.  It sold drugs and began extorting money from my neighbor.  It took candy from babies.  It sassed its elders.  I even found it in bed with my husband.<br />  Despite my outrage, and efforts to trap the abhorrent creature, it quickly spread its attentions throughout the neighborhood...then, the city.  It terrorized every man, woman and child...it spared no one.<br />  In desperation, I contacted the vendor for a refund.  "Oh hell no," the customer service man said.  "You wanted a fresh rabbit...and thats what you got.  No refunds!"<br />  Indeed, the rabbit was "fresh" and consequently recieved many outraged face slappings from local women. But I was desperate to be rid of the thing.  I found myself, desperate...alone...with nowhere to turn....  I wept bitter tears at the prospect of my fate and the humiliation I had endured as the rabbit effortlessly dismantled everything I valued in life. My back was against the wall...I had no choice but to fight.  The sound of my boots scraping upon the pavement of the sidewalk was comforting.  I was ready.  My jaw clenched and eyes squinted...I was pure courage.  I was armed.  On my belt I carried the weapons of my forefathers...a bubble pipe, a package of red vines, and a rubber mallet.  I was ready to destroy, or be destroyed...<br />  The rabbit saw me and seemed to sense my determination.  It had no head, but I sensed it sneering at me.  With a warbling screech, the rabbit attacked me. It flew to action, attempting to cripple me with a spinning back kick and a flurry of karate chops.  Gasping, I lashed back with my mallet, blowing my bubble pipe fiercely, and landed a hit soundly on the rabbits side.  Before it could recover, I began lashing it with the red vines, leaving bloody welts on its pale, graying flesh. It squealed in pain and squirmed behind a trash can, with me in hot pursuit...<br />  The rabbit unexpectly turned, and I made a grab at the skinny carcass, but it sped past meIt cursed me and fled. With no head, paws or fur, the animal was very streamlined and as fast as greased lightning.  I doggedly pursued it to the edge of town when I lost sight of it...and I was relieved to see that the rabbit did not seem to be turning back.<br />  It seemed that as quickly as it began...the rabbit's rampage was over.  The last time I saw the beast, I had been patrolling the city.  I saw that it was armed with two automatic rifles and strings of ammunition, and it appeared Rambo-esque upon a hill.  It screamed "Aaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaa!" and fired the weapons into the air.  It then ran and jumped into a jeep with Charlie Sheen and sped away...<br />  I saw a mushroom cloud form in the distance...<br />  I looked into the sunset, my teeth gritted with determination.  I would survive.  And as god as my witness, I would never be hungry again!<br />  I sit my weary body behind my computer once again, mopping beads of cool sweat from my forehead. I begin write this review. Gingerly, I start to type...."Yes, Virginia, this was a very bad rabbit...."

review/summary: Time saver
review/text: Like most country folks, I spend a lot of time trying to get the wild livestock on my property, arrows and atatali tend to be hard to use to hit small critters like rabbits and squirrels, shotguns and .22 tend to be noisy and scare the others making it difficult to get enough to feed the host of people that are waiting back at the house for dinner. This is a real time saver for only a few hundred dollars, I can feed all.  It would be better if it came with the fur and head so I could tan those and make a nice coat, hat or bed cover, after tanning the skin.  The best part of it is now my flower bed is over run with squirrels and rabbits.

review/summary: Beware Buyer: This Rabbit Comes DECEASED!
review/text: I bought this thinking it would make a wonderful gift to my neighbor's young son.  Ordering was simple, and delivery was flawless.  So you can imagine the shock and awe not only on my face, but also my neighbor's 3-year-old son, when he opened the package to find a DEAD rabbit.<br /><br />When I contacted Cloverdale about this issue, I found myself on hold for hours listening to John Tesh: Live at Red Rocks.  After 3 hours on hold, I was asked to leave a message.  Wait 3 hours and leave a message??<br /><br />Suffice to say, I have not heard back from Cloverdale.  Look closely people, nowhere on the page does it say that this rabbit comes DECEASED.  To all of you looking for a fun pet, do not be deceived by Cloverdale's deception.  This rabbit is NOT alive.  It is DEAD.

review/summary: Easter will never be the same
review/text: I have two little girls, ages 5 and 7, and for Easter this year, I decided that I wanted to get them a cute little bunny rabbit as a pet.  Well unfortunately for me, all the pet stores nearby were sold out, due to the popularity of rabbits at that time of year.  I had nearly given up on finding one, when I ran across this listing for fresh whole rabbits on amazon.com.  I wasn't sure what the first picture they showed was, but all the others were pictures of the kind of cute little bunny I wanted for my girls.  Maybe the first one was a rabbit just after it was born or something.  Seeing that the price was fairly reasonable, I ordered one.  I wasn't quite sure how they were going to get a live rabbit to me through the mail, but I figured "hey, if anyone can do it, Amazon.com can".<br /><br />When the package got to my house, I started to get a slight feeling that something wasn't right.  The box they had sent had no air-holes, and it was strangely cold to the touch.  But I figured that I didn't know anything about rabbits, so maybe that was normal.  Deciding to press on, I wrapped up the box and placed it under the Easter-tree in our living room (actually, it's just our old Christmas tree that I was too lazy to take out to the end of the driveway, but I won't tell if you don't).<br /><br />On Easter morning, my girls were up early, wanting to open their Easter present.  I sat on the couch, with my arm around my wife as they tore the paper off the package.  Eagerly awaiting their cries of happiness, I was startled when instead I heard screams of fear and horror.  The youngest was screaming that someone killed the Easter bunny, and the oldest barely made it to the bathroom in time to vomit.  As I looked in the box, expecting to see that maybe the poor rabbit had accidentally died, I saw instead, a rabbit carcass, gutted and skinned.<br /><br />Thinking that someone had played a horrible joke on our family, I immediately called Amazon.com to explain what had happened.  When I finally got done explaining our situation, the lady on the phone told me that the rabbits were supposed to be dead, they were meat rabbits, for eating.<br /><br />This is perhaps something that should be explicitly written in the description of the product on Amazon's website.  My daughters were incredibly traumatized by the situation, and are now undergoing counseling (at a rate of $200/hour) to help them deal with what they saw.  I shudder to think of what Easter will be like next year.<br /><br />So in short, it needs to be said in the product description that these rabbits are DEAD, and they are for eating.  Don't make the same mistake I did.

review/summary: Man mauled by pack of wolves...
review/text: I am writing this review from the hospital... A couple of weeks ago I ordered the "Whole Rabbit" from Amazon in hopes of having my wife cook it up nice and good.<br /><br />The problem started when I opened the box. Of course I had been wearing my 3 Wolf Moon T-shirt for about 3 weeks (Still had another week before it needed to be washed) and the pack was hungry. They proceeded to claw and bite at the Whole Rabbit. I was an innocent bystander as the wolves mauled at my own torso trying to get to that waskally wabbit torso I held in my hands.<br /><br />There was no way I wanted to give it up as my wife has a great recipe she found on Amazon. The ingredients, to name a few, are; Tuscan Milk (naturally), Uranium Ore, and Twinkies. Anyways, the Whole Rabbit never got cooked, I ended up with scars about the head, neck, chest, back, stomach, and face. But worst of all, my beloved 3WM t-shirt is in utter ruins (at least they got fed).<br /><br />I can't afford to buy another one because of all the hospital bills, does anyone want to donate a 3WM to me? I will never buy rabbit from the internet again, I will stick to the live ones at the pet shop. I just need to make sure my Burmese python isn't roaming the house free when I bring the live one home... wish me luck!

review/summary: May be our nation's only hope!!
review/text: As we all know, the world is about to be consumed by a massive blob of crude oil gushing out of a hole in the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. The oil rig that made the hole in the Gulf floor in the first place was owned by a little Mom & Pop concern called British Petroleum. "BP" is a scrappy little underdog of an oil company that was just trying to compete with the other giant, evil oil companies. They are the noble little corner grocer whilst other oil companies are analogous to Wal-Mart and as such the oil rig used by BP didn't have all the bells and whistles of the oil rigs used by the "Big Box" oil companies, bells and whistles like a simple battery that was supposed to have powered the alarm system that would have stopped this entire disaster from happening. You just know those batteries have got to be VERY expensive if it's cheaper to take a chance on a disaster that will cause untold and possibly global economic and environmental damage. We can't hold the lack of obviously expensive safety equipment against BP however, as oil companies operate on the slimmest of margins and usually don't return much of a profit to The Stockholders, who are people too.<br /><br />  BP tried to stop the gusher with something called a Top Hat and then a Hot Tap. These didn't work so they moved to their well thought out and scientifically tested Plan C, which was to stop the oil gusher by shooting golf balls into it. Surprisingly this didn't work so they attempted to shoot other things into the hole, up to and including: tennis balls, those tiny sponge dinosaurs that grow to enormous size when you get them wet, Swanson Hungry Man dinners(abandoned when deemed more dangerous to ocean life than the oil cloud), a gelatinous sludge vacuumed out from behind Kirstie Alley's knees and the entirety of Rush Limbaugh.( Adding Rush to a monstrous cloud of oil only resulted in a larger and more powerful Limbaugh, which is still being combated by the military as I write this).<br /><br />  Luckily, those feisty little can-doers down at BP hit upon a sure fire idea. They are going to shoot thousands of tons of fresh whole rabbits into the hole. Why will this work when the other methods failed to produce results? Let me answer your question with a question of my own...What is the universal symbol of luck in modern society? The rabbit's foot. And these whole rabbit carcasses are lousy with them. BP engineers have determined that these rabbit carcasses, because of the association between rabbit feet and superstitious luck, have a greater chance of plugging that hole than almost any other method. A wise man once said that any problem the mind of man can set, the mind of man can solve. So I'm not worried folks, this time things are sure to work out. If they don't however, I'd warn any leprechauns you care about to leave the country for a long, long time.

Uranium in a jar? Oh, never mind. They're already selling a handy one-use size jar of Uranium Ore 238 on this site for people who might choose to cook their bunnies in a conveniently sized mini-nuclear reactor. Hey, it's a swell idea for those fun folks who live off the grid in those isolated cabins high up in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest. You can have your well-cooked bunny and have it glow in the dark, too.<br /><br />God bless the internet.

review/text: Darn, you people are having alot of fun reviewing this item....<br /><br />Personally, I don't know why some people get so offended by the consumption of rabbit.  (I guess it's the cows and pigs and chickens' own darn fault for not being small, cute, and fuzzy...).  Rabbits are very healthy, and they are actually helping with some hunger issues in developing countries.  But again, if only cows and chickens were cute and fuzzy, too....<br /><br />With that said, I'm a vegetarian.  I find it rather hippocritical since alot of the people who get so offended with the consumption of rabbit would be perfectly OK with the consumption of beef or pork.  Especially, beef, for example, causes alot of enviromental damage to the world and many end up living a far from favorable lives before the final slaughter due to supply and demand.<br /><br />No, I'm not saying that you should all go vegetarian as well, nor am I encouraging everyone to grab a knife and fork and start chasing after bunnies.  I'm just saying... that rejecting so harshly on the simple notion that you think it is gross is rather close minded.  Just saying that it's not for you would have been sufficient.

review/summary: I know what it's like to be a feral dog
review/text: Like many suburban homeowners, I like to kill and eat the wild animals that populate my backyard. To keep it sporting, I hunt naked, with my teeth and long sharpened fingernails as my only weapons. I've feasted on squirrel, raccoon, vole and numerous songbirds. But no matter how long I lay spread eagle and motionless in the hot noonday sun, I have never been able to outwit and catch any of the plump and juicy rabbits that hop just outside my reach and then bolt for the woods when I leap forward with a blood-curdling shriek. I have chased them at a dead run through the yards of the many unoccupied homes that surround mine but the pursuit always ends in frustration. But no more, thanks to Amazon. Every week, I order a fresh whole rabbit and affix it to a remote control car that is operated by one of my children. This way, I get the thrill of the hunt, and when the car's batteries are exhausted, I can leap upon it, bury my teeth into the rabbit's soft flesh and perform my ritual victory dance right there in the Walgreen's parking lot.

review/summary: Whole Rabbit - NOT!
review/text: I ordered one of these Fresh "Whole" Rabbits, but when it arrived its head, fur and insides were missing.  Not exactly whole, I'd say!  Maybe it was just damaged during shipping, but I won't be buying another one.  I mean - without the long ears, how do I know it even WAS a rabbit?  It was the same size and shape as a cat...not that I've seen a cat with its head, fur and insides missing.  I mean, not like really close or anything.<br /><br />On the plus side, it was delicious with a tall, cold glass of Tuscan Milk, so I give it three stars.  That's three WHOLE stars, BTW.

review/text: I bought this for my kids since they wanted a bunny for Easter. I remember getting a bunny when I was their age. So I typed "Rabbit" into the search function here on Amazon and ordered this and opted for the optional gift wrapping. Imagine the look on the faces of little Jimmy and Suzie when they opened this up on Easter morning. They cried the whole day and it really made the Easter Egg hunt a downer. If you buy this product please understand that it is dead. It may have been alive when it was first packed but the box didn't have any holes in it.

review/summary: The Centerpiece of a Sumptuous Feast
review/text: I used to scour the supermarkets, butcher shops, and even farmers markets to buy my whole animals for the evening feast, but when I came across this spectacular cut of fresh rabbit on the internet, I could not resist.  I salivated for hours, staring at its slightly discolored flesh while I counted the ways in which I could create such a sumptuous feast.  I thought back to reruns of old Bugs Bunny cartoons in which Elmer Fudd and the other various antagonizers dreamed up ways in which to serve a delicious juicy rabbit.<br /><br />I quickly ordered one as fast as I could and when it arrived, there it was, complete within its vacuum packed container, my little bunny rabbit.  I immediately threw everything off the kitchen counter, grabbed my copy of "The Joy of Cooking", no wait...."Mastering The Art of French Cooking" by Julia Child and got to work on my delicious supper.  Several long laborious hours later, I enjoyed a tasty and delicious Rabbit Stew Bernaise using the entire rabbit, sparing no leftovers so that nobody would be able to taste its sweet juicy goodness except for myself and myself alone.  Paired with a tall white glass of Tuscan Whole Milk, my supper was a sumptuous feast that I will cherish for years to come.

review/text: Smeagol was out creepin before the fat hobbitses woke up when he decided to search amazon for discounts on raw fish, as I detest the filthy hobbits's lombus bread. Smeagol was [GOLEM GOLEM GOLEM] thrilled when he discoveredses the rabbit meatses. Being at the low price of 43.50, smeagol was worriesed about the quality of the meat, so he decided to compare it to some rabbitses he caught himself. First off, ordering the fresh whole rabbitses saved smeagol the hassle of finding rabbitses. We also founds that we could avoids the process of snapping their necks, as well as skinning them. In terms of flavor, the fresh whole rabbit was every bit as fresh as the rabbit smeagol found him self. It is to be noted, however, that the first rabbit smeagol found had been rotting for several days. The only problem Smeagol found with the fresh whole rabbitses is [GOLEM GOLEM GOLEM] that Smeagol had less variety to choose from. We are accustom to young and tender rabbitses, where as this whole rabbit was deffinately of a riper age. And after this, the fat hobbitses awakes and tells me he wants potatoes. POTATOES.

review/summary: It's Raining Hershey's and Hasenpfeffer!
review/text: My favorite holiday, Easter, is right around the corner. Easter is one of the most solemn and holy days on the calendar. It's a day when families come together to dress up in pastel leisure suits, clock in at church for the year, and spend the weekend celebrating that time when the Romans nailed a chocolate bunny to a cross, and it came back three days later as a bag of marshmallow peeps.<br /><br />Or something. I sort of skimmed that part in Sunday School.<br /><br />Anyway, it's pretty great. So I decided to stock up on Easter party supplies.<br /><br />Anyone can hide plastic eggs; I thought the kids in my neighborhood deserved a REAL Easter experience. They should have an ACTUAL bunny rabbit, giving out candy and treats -- just like in the Easter cartoons.<br /><br />So I bought this rabbit, thinking that 'fresh' and 'whole' were great qualities for an Easter bunny. Sadly, I didn't think about 'alive' or 'unskinned', of which this thing is neither. So my idea of training it to hand out candy sort of went out the window.<br /><br />No matter. I stuffed the carcass full of Peeps and Reese's pieces, and strung it up by the legs in a tree in the yard. The kids took turns whacking at it with barbecue tongs until it all came tumbling out, like some sort of hairless Easter party pinata.<br /><br />I've never seen kids cry so much while they're picking up candy. Somebody ought to teach these children the TRUE meaning of Easter.

review/summary: So Much Fun! But...where do you put the batteries???
review/text: Rabbits have been a "must have" for single women everywhere and almost all of my friends have one. Well, normally rabbits are upwards of $100+ dollars! Although I've heard they are SOOOOOO worth it, I could never afford one....UNTIL NOW!! I was so excited (literally) to find one under $50 that I could barely control myself as I whipped out my credit card. I opted for express shipping and then countered that additional cost by selecting a 'gently used' one! I was tingling with anticipation all day and rushed home to find my rabbit waiting on my door step. I quickly grabbed the package and dashed to my bedroom while tearing off clothing as fast as possible. I launched myself onto the bed and rip open the package and...now I can't figure out where to put the batteries!

review/summary: NOT what was expected.
review/text: I was delighted to discover this product whilst browsing online for a birthday gift for my youngest daughter, who has recently turned six and has long been bugging her mother and I for a pet. As a busy father  it pleased me that, in the modern age, a "fresh whole rabbit" could be crated up in a tiny, airtight box and the little fellow flown direct to me for my convenience, saving me much of the trouble associated with fatherhood.<br /><br />Although irksome that no individual pictures were attached (other than that of what appears to be a rather old, sleeping rabbit), it seemed to good to be true, especially when I learned it could be delivered in time for my daughter's party, to be opened and enjoyed by both the eager birthday girl herself and her rabble of little friends. However, much to my daughter's horror upon opening her much awaited, rabbit-shaped gift, she discovered what I now, after much consideration, believe to be - not a fresh or whole rabbit - but rather a dead rabbit - thus, decidedly neither fresh, nor, vitally....whole. Perhaps the vendors could consider selling this item under the heading "deceased rabbit" or "rabbit corpse" to ensure no future confusion amongst the realms of well-meaning, loving fathers, such as myself.<br /><br />Hysterical tears ensued, divorce was threatened and several children fled the house never to be seen again. More importantly, despite much coaxing I can't get the little fellow to hop around the hutch I built for him in the garden and, after a week, he is starting to smell (which, I grant you, is something that rabbits naturally do, but the neighbours are starting to complain). Mind you, this rabbit has proved most economical, as I have not had to replace the carrots and lettuce leaves in his bowl once since we got him. Must be on a diet.<br /><br />My wife has since left me, claiming she is "taking the children to her mother's house" as this is just too much after the "fresh whole Pony" I ordered for my eldest daughter's birthday last September. Why does no good, fatherly deed go unpunished? On the plus side, week old rabbit remains delicious. Thoroughly recommended as a snack to gnaw on whilst sitting on the sofa in one's underwear, watching football re-runs at 3 in the morning after one's wife has left one.

review/text: I ordered this product as a gift for my four year old daughter, as I have fond memories of my mother giving me a pet rabbit for Easter when I was that age. "Whole Rabbit" indeed! To my utter disappointment, this rabbit lacked fur, a head, and numerous vital organs that provide that sense of comforting warmth that one would expect a whole rabbit to provide.<br /><br />Needless to say my child was quite unnerved upon unwrapping "Snuggles", and spent a large portion of her Birthday cowering in a corner. On top of everything else, after the first few days I noticed a terrible odor coming from the animal and my daughters comforter was splotched with impossible to remove stains. Perhaps it has educational value for older children, but I cannot recommend it as a gift for children under five.

However in some benign act the ladybugs began to mutate. Creating some hybrid rabbit beast that attempted to consume me.<br />Of course I had preordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MRD5JO">7 Million Live Beneficial Nematodes-Kills over 230 Bugs</a> who quickly reduced the super ladybug rabbit beast down to mulch.<br /><br />I'm not overly pleased with the rabbit but I still have three more and a half tin of Uranium.

review/text: I'm so glad that you can finally buy fresh whole rabbits, ready to go, right from Amazon!  You might think that with the shipping charge, that this is a pricey item, but compared to with what I've been paying at Petco, this is a steal, especially when you consider the prep work that this saves me!  If you value your time and your money, you'll order your bunnies online from now on.  Delicious and plump, and none of that irksome pre-butchering hopping!

review/text: I can't explain how much of a difference this product has made in my life. It is hard enough being a Carny in a traveling circus, but imagine how hard it is being a magician with all these new laws being passed to protect live animals. I thought my career was over until I found this. There are so many laws and regulations in each and every state about using live animals for performances that I had to give up my number act, pulling a rabbit out of my hat. UNTIL NOW! I was able to skirt the false advertisment laws by telling everyone I would be pulling a "real" rabbit out of my hat. How's that for creative marketing? Sure, they aren't exactly pleased with my act, but what can they do? I told the truth. I'm only in town long enough to get put on the sex offender registry and learn the bathroom stall "knock codes" at the local boys club (if you know what I mean). I would have given it 5 stars, but you have to find a way to keep it chilled or it will start to stink. I don't want to scare off the bearded lady you know.

I was invited to a square dance birthday party, and the e-vite said, "in lieu of gifts, please bring food,", so of course I had to make my world-famous rabbit twinkies!  The only problem was, my husband/father hadn't brought any rabbit meat home that day (instead he brought road-kill raccoon- good, but not for twinkies), so I ordered some of this Fresh Whole Rabbit with some of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.  Needless to say, my rabbit twinkies were a big hit!  GOD BLESS AMAZON!<br /><br />P.S.<br />I know ya'll will be asking for my recipe, so here it is!<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz<br />Fresh Whole Rabbit<br />Uranium Ore<br />37 boxes of Twinkies<br />A dash of wolf urine<br /><br />Combine all ingredients in your Relaxman Relaxation Capsule, (It don't matter how much of each ingredient, I like to just pour buckets of each into the RRC until it's fuller than a stuffed porcupine).  Turn on, and once all them ingredients are mixed, fill the twinkies with the mixture (I like to save the twinkie filling to put on burgers).<br /><br />Hope ya'll enjoy!

review/summary: I'm In A New Hare Club For Men!!!
review/text: I'm always looking for a new dinner idea for my family.  Just in the last month, I've prepared ostrich burgers, lemming tartare, and feral catserole.  But none of those tasty treats prepared me for the magic of Fresh Whole Rabbit!<br /><br />I'll admit to a little hesitation when I first ordered this gastronomic wonder; I mean, what if his little fur coat got damp and the package arrived smelling ripe?  Well, the good folks at Cloverdale already considered this problem, and thoughtfully skinned the little guy ahead of time!  (Yes, the rabbit was a "guy".  But I'll leave my "Rabbit Penis Soup" recipe for another review...)  Anyway, the rabbit comes packed in triple-layered dry ice and charcoal, and wrapped in a festive satin bag.  Can you spell CLASSY?  (If not, it's right there in the previous sentence.)<br /><br />There were so many preparation options in the enclosed cookbook, so to keep it simple, I chose the simple yet elegant "Raw Chunks on Toothpicks" from the "Rabbitizers" section.  It tasted like sushi, only completely different!  We had enough left over for some vodka-infused Rabbitinis (found in the "Bunny Sippers" section).  I can also attest to the powerful aphrodisiac effect of eating rabbit; not only was the food seductive, but the rabbit's glandular secretions make for a powerful musk that can make any boudoir seem like a vegetable garden!<br /><br />In closing, I will definitely order this exquisite gourmet cuisine again.  And here's a fun suggestion:  Leftover rabbit carcasses + Fishing line = Extra-Cute mobile for hanging over the crib!

review/summary: Delicious comes at a price
review/text: Sure, it might be a little expensive, but trust me when I say it's completely worth it. A full-blown cow might not cost $43.50, but if you think a thousand pounds of bland, worthless cow meat compares anywhere near this 3 lb (1.4kg) succulent morsel, you've got another thing coming. The instant I took my first bite into this rabbit, I literally came in my pants. It's just that incredible. There was no warning, no time to react, just pure unadulterated joy enveloping my entire body. I don't care if I have to spend my first-born's college fund to get it, I NEED the unique nutty flavor of this fresh whole rabbit!<br />I've noticed some distain regarding the unethical treatment of these rabbits, but the rest of us know that rabbits don't feel pain. I would bet money that these rabbits are proud to serve their human masters. We give them a good life on the farm, eating the finest quality carrots, mating with the most beautiful females in the modern rabbit world. Giving their lives to please a superior race is really all these little critters want in life.<br />Bottom Line: 5 stars isn't nearly enough for this product. I went as far as to draw 5 more little gold stars on my screen just to clear my conscience.

review/summary: 4 for one...its a toss up.
review/text: There are few places I go these days without a little protection.  Many people in today's society pay in incredible amount of money for insurance, back up data on external hard drives, wear safety gear while engaging in extreme sports and use birth control to keep the family size under control.<br /><br />I assume many of you are like me and boldly buck the silly and illogical solutions marketed by big business and today's media by simply having on my person the appendage of a rabbit.<br />With this purchase, I take this proven method of good fortune and multiply it by 4.  By my rock solid logic, if one foot brings good luck, would not all four be vastly superior? Include not just the foots but the rest of the animal, and you may alter destiny itself.<br /><br />The elimination of the fur is ingenious as well, as the charm becomes harder to stain and certainly much easier to clean.<br /><br />The purchase lost a two stars because of inconvenience and longevity.  I can no longer hang the trinket in the usual places.  My key chain becomes fairly cumbersome with this addition and while my rear-view mirror can hold the beast (that is where it is now)I have found that tight corners leaves myself, my windshield and anyone riding middle front or shotgun a little battered and slightly damp.  In addition to this, I have only had the 4 legged lucky protector for 6 months, and my car is basically uninhabitable due to the smell.  After a particularly hot summer, I am looking toward a harsh winter to retain the corpse's form for a little longer, and then I will likely be getting another one of these (and probably a can of Febreze) next spring when they are in season.<br /><br />To be honest, I can get a traditional rabbit foot for just a dollar or two downtown...and they last forever (I have about 17), but since this has been in my car...no accidents, lawsuits, injuries, and scarcely a disagreement with my wife.<br /><br />Is it worth the $?  It has been for me...I guess you can put a price on safety.

review/summary: What an Item of Wonderment!
review/text: Let me take you back to a cold Christmas morning, stockings hung over the fireplace, the tree trimmed with all manner of fanciful decorations, and small children fast asleep, ready to awaken to the dawn of the best day of the year. My eyes flew open as the sun peeked above the bottom of my window pane. It was the day that everyone had been awaiting all year!<br />Practically bludgeoning my siblings out of the way, I made a dash for the stockings. I always had gone for the stocking first. A few gift cards, some candy, maybe even a Pez dispenser. Nothing too exciting. What I smelled next, however, made my heart skip and my breath catch. I knew exactly what was under the tree for me.<br />As mother and father watched on warmly, my siblings and I tore through the wrappings of our gifts. Soon they'd all be jealous of me. No one was going to get something quite so special as what I was about to receive. The room was soon filled with the invigorating scent of red meat and blood. I became dizzy just fantasizing about spending long hours with my new gift. I finally pulled the last shred of dripping, rotting wrapping paper from the carcass, my eyes lit with the purest of joys.<br />I'd gotten just what I'd asked for.<br />The beautifully gory dead rabbit, its skin peeled off in some enticingly cannibalistic way, oozing blood and pus and its bones skewed at odd angles, hung limply in my arms as I squeezed it tightly like a stuffed animal. "Thank you!" I squealed in pleasure before running off to my room with the decaying corpse to snuggle. What more could anyone possible want? A dead rabbit is the greatest, most useful thing that anyone could ever buy.<br />It truly was a night of wonderment, and one that my family and I will always remember.

review/summary: Rabbits be good medicine
review/text: Listen, it all happened a few years ago.  I felt pretty good the night before, but when I awoke I had shooting pains in my left hip extending to my testicle.  Well, I went to the Doctor and as all regular doctors do, he pretty much told me to take an Advil and get back to him.  Well, not only didn't it help, but he billed my insurance over $400!  After extensive google searches, I decided to check out a Chinese traditional physician, and after checking out my Chi flow and other such things I won't bother you with, he wrote some scribble on a note (it was Chinese) and when I asked him what it meant, he said "RABBIT! You eat!".  Aha! Perhaps this was the cure I was looking for, and decided to procure one.  Needless to say, Pet stores were pretty horrified at my request of "One medicinal rabbit", and sent me on my way.  The next thing I tried was going out in the woods to hunt a rabbit.  But let me tell you, they are pretty FAST!  After trying many methods, such as a home-made spear, rocks, and just trying to chase it through the woods, not only did I not catch a rabbit, my Left hip and testicle hurt more than ever!  Finally, I found this rabbit on Amazon, and despite it being more expensive than Kobe Beef, I decided, "What the Heck!" and ordered it up.  When it arrived, it did not look very appetizing, but I cooked it up in something called "Hassenpfeffer" and when I told my roomate, he just said, "Whatever floats your boat, dude...carry on."<br />I ate my rabbit while watching an old rerun of "Man versus wild" and went to bed with a full stomach but not much hope that rabbit meat would cure me.  However, within just a few days, my hip and testicle were as good as new, and I will never question Chinese medicine again.  I already have an order in for a tiger bone, which supposedly is amazing in the dept of virility.<br />Bravo, rabbit meat! Excelsior!

review/text: Let me first say that this is a great product. I come from a family that absolutely refuses to ingest any sort of ugly or particularly stupid animal; instead, we insist on the cutest and most intelligent ones (still hoping a fresh whole dolphin will show up on Amazon one of these days). Hey, we're a principled group. I practically order one of these every week.<br /><br />The quality control isn't the greatest. Sometimes I get a head but no face included, other times I get a head and a face but the bunny had lazy eyes (appetizing as can be), or sometimes strangely there'll be only one eye. I've also received bunnies with birth defects, bunnies that certainly weren't fresh, bunnies that had 90% of the meat removed and I was left with basically a bunny "skin suit" (I just end up putting this in the cage with my pet bunny, whose cage sits on the dining room table where flowers or a candle would be in a normal household); the list goes on.<br /><br />Now that you've heard about the pros, here are the cons: no Amazon Prime?! No 'subscribe and save'? Come on Amazon, work out a deal with the rabbit killers and give us these two options. I pay good money to be a Prime member and I hate seeing all the good products aren't even a part of the benefits. Let's start a petition, guys.

review/summary: I like the idea of a new food source, but I choose to let my bunnies free range.
review/text: I really like the idea of a food source that isn't chicken, turkey or beef raised in feed lots, but it is much more practical to plant a prize winning garden and wait for some rabbits to move in and eat up your prized plants, and then sneak out and tag a few with lightweight transmitter collars in the middle of the night.<br /><br />That way, you have a wild, free range food source.  Your herd will get the best free food possible by going out and eating all of your neighbors flowers.  Marigolds really impart something great to the flavor of the meat.  Sunflower plants also give them a really nice mild flavor.<br /><br />That way, it cost you nearly nothing (except of course the cost and toil of raising your lovely garden initially) to have a readily available and fresh food source at hand.<br /><br />With the radio collars, you can easily track where your herd is currently foraging.  Whether it be down the street on cranky old Mrs. Hagersteins prized flower, or on your hippie neighbors cherished "Organic and sustainable" vegan garden.<br /><br />Plus, everyone knows that wild, so called "nuisance" pests are the absolute lowest fat, and have the best diet.<br /><br />Good idea though, all the same!  I just like my food source to be "free range".<br /><br />Mark :)

We love quoting the lines from "Damages" and "Wall Street," but when Friday night really gets cooking (if you know what I mean), we like to play "Fatal Attraction" -- the romantic game that's sort of, well, the grown-up equivalent of spin the bottle, which we remember playing back in seventh grade.<br /><br />The biggest problem, though, is where to get the rabbit.  My neighbor always seems to notice when we break in and take Fluffy (as well as Fluffy 2 and Fluffy 3).  It really seems to bother him when we do this -- obviously, he doesn't have much tolerance for role-playing, or maybe he just wants to save Fluffy for his own recipe.  Whatever.  When we found this dead frozen rabbit on Amazon, we said, "Hey, that's the kind Glen Close would use" (if, that is, she was not very quick and agile and was unable to capture a bunny by her wits and fast grabbing).<br /><br />Packaging is fine -- nice shrink-wrap deal -- but a little bit too tough to cut through when the passion is starting to escalate and you need a frozen dead rabbit to put in that pot of boiling water right before your lover walks through the door.  Sometimes you wish it was just in plain old white butcher wrap.  But then again, the letter carrier would be jealous; no doubt he'd take it home to his own wife and they would play some kinky game themselves.  For now, I'm the one who brings home the big dead rabbit, thanks to Amaazon's all-inclusive website.  (Next week, my wife and I will go online in hopes of finding supplies to act out that fine Joe Pesci film, "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag."  With luck, maybe Amazon will make it a Daily Deal!  Or, who knows, at least maybe they'll let us buy a nice, new duffel bag if the rest of it is on backorder!)

review/summary: Couldn't wait to get it!
review/text: A lot of my friends like to shop online, so I added this to my baby registry.  My best friend received one at her shower and she loves it!  So when I got TWO at my shower, it wasn't the disaster other duplicate gifts can be!  My little girl is now three months old and we are still getting a lot of use out of the Fresh Whole Rabbits.

review/summary: Mixed Experience - Watership Down Reenactment Prop
review/text: I waited with baited breath for the arrival of the 20 Fresh Whole Rabbit's to arrive so my children and I could begin production of our own Watership Down Reenactment.  Shipping was lightening fast and our props arrived securely packed in dry ice.  Imagine my surprise when I found that the heads and paws of my little actors were missing?!?!  They don't even have skin.  I can handle the lack of internal organs of course.  What really matters are the external features of stage props.<br /><br />Not to be defeated my 12 year old daughter made a resourceful suggestion.  Why should we not replace the missing head and limbs with paper machete.  This is the sort of innovation that convinces me that Tabitha has a destiny on Broadway!!!<br /><br />Despite the inconvenience of having to build the body parts I must say these carcasses are well suited to the task.  They are easy to perforate with wire.  A brushing of super glue and a roll in fuzz and we have our little actors.<br /><br />Also:  They are posse able to a certain degree if you wire them in place.  This was very helpful for certain scenes in our production.<br /><br />One more negative however,  after 5 dress rehearsals our little actors smell quite bad.  This is, in my opinion a design flaw that should be part of this product description.  For that reason I am giving this 3 stars.  Sure it was workable material but it was not everything I should get for paying so much for 20 of these!

review/summary: Down the rabbit hole
review/text: I found it to be a bit gamey. And that's after 6 hours in a slow-cooker. It looks a bit tough and leathery in the photo, and it really is. Plus I think mine had one or two shotgun buck pellets still in it. Does anyone know if there is a Le Village in Greenwich? Maybe it is fresher to pick it up in-store...

review/summary: So versatile
review/text: This gift makes an excellent stocking stuffer and for any other occasion as well.  Every blushing bride to be has dreamed about how tasty their wedding rabbit will be so be sure not to disappoint them.  Buy a large amount for a fun new building material for your kid's play fortress.  Also great for self defense against murderous hobos but admittedly less effective against garden variety thieving hobos.  Impress the boss with a sharp rabbit carcass suit.  Also makes for delicious smoothies!!!

review/text: When our little Timothy was hospitalized last spring after an attack of severe awkwardness, we were sad because he'd miss Easter, his favorite holiday.  We thought of surprising him with a pet rabbit, but we hit on a cheaper solution: a Fresh Whole Rabbit dressed up in a sock with little holes cut out for the arms and head would make a darling Easter Bunny hand puppet!<br /><br />Bunny looked better ass end up so we drew little eyes on his bum and shifted his ears aft (turns out duct tape doesn't stick to clammy surfaces so we ended up stapling them on).  A little lipstick completed the effect, and generous application of air freshener helped mask the raw smell.<br /><br />Words can't describe Timmy's look of surprise and delight when he met his new friend!  All the more so because his paralyzing awkwardness lent the whole scene a kind of cringe-inducing pathos.  Things took an alarming turn when Bunny refused to come off dad's arm: he'd rammed it in so tight the little buck teeth fastened onto his elbow like nails.  It took the doctors 45 minutes  to surgically remove it, and when infection set in there were ominous whispers of gangrene, but it cleared up eventually and now we all laugh about the scars.  I strongly recommend ordering a tub of Vaseline to go with the Fresh Whole Rabbit if you want to try this yourself!
