review/summary: Best cereal for an adult
review/text: When diagnosed with Celiac Disease I really missed eating good tasting cereals.  I tried a lot of other gluten free cereals and they were not filling, would get soggy, and often were so full of sweeteners, they even left my mouth feeling raw.  Perky's Nutty Flax is awesome!  It is filling, not too sweet, tastes great on yogurt or can be eaten alone.  And it stays crunchy for a long time, an added bonus for a busy mom in the mornings.  I highly recommend this cereal for anyone with Celiac Disese that used to love cereal.  In fact, I need to start buying this in bulk since the rest of my family discovered it and loves it.  I is so nice that my kids, who do not have Celiac Disease, eat a healthy cereal like this.

review/summary: Very tasty allergy friendly cereal.
review/text: I tried this cereal when my son was discovered to be allergic to peanuts.  Many cereal manufacturers are not labeling peanut allergens, nor will they answer questions about them when you call.  Post would not help at all.  Then I learned of Enjoy Life and their Perky's cereals.  I really liked this one.  It has a slightly nutty flavor, stays crunchy in milk and when mixed in with yogurt.  It is dense not lite at all.  It has a good level of fiber and the flax makes it have good fats too!  Plus, no unhealthy sugars.  My kids like the flavor, but have problems with the size since they are little tiny balls.  This cereal is great when making treats though.  It works well with crispie type treats and cookies.  I am next going to try it as a pie crust for the pumpkin pie this season.  Amazon has a pretty good deal on the price as well.  It is $4 per box at my local market at least.  I'm saving about a $1 per box ordering here.  I will buy again!

review/text: FINALLY a gluten-free cereal with nutrition, texture, and taste. I mix this with various and sundry items, like walnuts, almonds, flax meal, dried fruit, frozen pomegranate seeds, etc, to make a sort of granola. I had been using Trader Joe's granola, but it's quite sweet and not terribly nutritious; Chex get soggy very quickly and didn't really go well with the nuts and fruit; and puffed millet was just mushy. Nutty Flax was a revelation! It tastes just like Grape Nuts to me, with slightly less crunch (that's a good thing, since Grape Nuts could be a little too hard).

review/summary: Grapenuts like cereal without the mouth injuries
review/text: I love this cereal!  It reminds me of what I remember grapenuts tasting like, but without the sharp texture.  I've been GF for 7+ years so I can't swear its exactly the same, but it certainly hit the craving.<br /><br />An added bonus is it's actually healthy! (200 calories, 6g fiber, 7g protein)  The only thing to note about nutrition is there doesn't appear to be any added vitamins so there appears to be less than some of the more traditional cereals.<br /><br />Its nothing like a kids cereal or even a granola or cereals like honey bunches of oats.  Don't expect anything beyond grapenuts (mildly nutty, mildly sweet), but if you're missing grapenuts, you should try this!

review/summary: Great gluten free cereal option
review/text: I went gluten free about 6 months ago and initially it was a struggle to figure out what to eat in the mornings.  I missed the crunch and texture of cereals and toast.  I first found Perky's Crunchy Flax at a major health food grocer, but it was priced over a dollar higher per box.  I was thrilled to find the bulk deal on Amazon as the boxes aren't very large and between my husband and I, we tend to go through at least 3 boxes a week.  This cereal is filling and delicious--I simply eat it with vanilla almond milk and it's perfect.  My husband likes to add a little honey to sweeten, but I don't feel it's necessary.  The cereal doesn't get soggy quickly at all, by the way.  It's proven a healthy and easy breakfast option and become a daily staple.

review/summary: High fiber for those eating gluten-free diet
review/text: If you've tried a gluten-free diet, you might know just how difficult it is to get fiber in your diet that comes from grains.  This cereal is a great step in that direction.  A 3/4 cup serving provides 24% of your daily requirement of fiber - and it's good for protein, too. The cereal is very crunchy, but if you like it a bit less crunchy, just pour on the milk and let it sit for 5 minutes or so - it will still have crunch, but not quite as much.  (Be prepared for these little cereal pieces to swell like crazy when they absorb milk - might explain why they're so filling!)<br /><br />The biggest drawback of this cereal is its price.  You get 5 servings in a box.  When I first ordered it on Amazon, it was between $34 and $35 for 12 boxes (with free shipping and subscribe and save).  Don't know why, but the price has jumped to about $20-$25 more per 12 boxes (that's close to $60 for a case of 12 boxes)!  This change just happened in a week's time, and I have no idea why.  That's crazy!!!  I looked for these at my local whole foods coop and found them for $3.30 a box - still more than what I used to pay on Amazon, but much better than the current price.  Come on Amazon, what gives?????

I added lots of sweetener as it didn't have any sweetness that I could tell and I wouldn't have been able to get it down otherwise.  Looked for an expire date in case it was bad but didn't see one.

It DOES NOT taste exactly like coffee, but can easily be used as a substitute.  I added brown sugar and Bailey's brand of Irish Creamer to it, and thoroughly enjoyed every sip.  I did not mix it with any regular coffee whatsoever, but instead decided to just try a cup of the product alone.  I must say, it is very DELICIOUS.  I am looking forward to trying some of the other flavors.  What I like even more about it, is that it is made with herbs and nuts; you can hardly go wrong with that!

If you really have to have a sweetener of some kind, try a hazelnut creamer, as it helps make it palatable to those who need a little sweet with their coffee.

The portion is just right for a sandwich (Its a lot bigger than the typical ketchup packet) and each is only 10 Calories. I have even put them out for a BBQ and people ate them and didn't even realize that they were Fat Free.......the flavor is smooth and good for those cutting back on calories. They don't need to be in the fridge.<br /><br />At first I was hesitant, because I was worried that they would come with a close expiration date, considering there are 200 packets. But they go fast if you eat a lot of sandwiches for lunch, and mine came fresh with a year +++ to spare.<br /><br />I have even considered taking them in my purse and substituting it in things like Fast Food Chicken sandwiches, since the mayo they use is "Heavy restaurant Mayo" and it totally busts the calorie load in just about anything. It's a quick 150 calorie cut to your meal.

review/summary: How to identify the expiration date
review/text: When I received my box of Kraft fat free mayonnaise packets I immediately checked the individual packets for an expiration date and there was none. I then looked on the box and found a UPC code and another code with 7 alpha-numeric characters (ex: 08M07C0). I called Kraft Foods and was told the code next to the UPC code was the expiration date. Using the code on my box as an example (08M07C0), the code reads as MM(letter)DD(letter)Y. This translates to August 7, 2010. I asked about the letters in the code and was told they have nothing to do with the manufacturing date.  Kraft Foods also said these packets have a Shelf Life of 5 months only. So my box was manufactured on 08/07/10 and expires on 01/07/11. Kraft Foods did not recommend using the packets after the expiration date. I would like to see Amazon list the expiration date of their stock so you know how much useful life is left to a grocery item. Maybe they could create a link on the page that you could click on and have the expiration date displayed.

review/summary: Great Value, if it wasnt 18 days from expiriing
review/text: I purchased these February 4th, and they shipped 2 Day Air with my Amazon Prime.  However as will the other reviews, they only have a 5 month shelf life.  The box I received expires in 18 days.  Luckily Amazon issued a refund for the product.<br /><br />Had the product had more time left on the shelf life it would have been an excellent buy.  However the 18 day limit but a real ding in my plan to take them to work to use for my sandwiches at lunch

review/summary: Krafte Mayonnaise Fat Free packets
review/text: I ordered Kraft Fat Free Mayo packets, to carry around in my purse so I have it available when eating out.  They are delicious, and very low calorie. The first shipment came, and it had only a 2 month expiration left.  I called Amazon, and they replaced the shipment with another one.  I received the second shipment WITH THE SAME EXACT EXPIRATION DATE. Since there was no way that I would consume 200 packets of mayo in a two month period, I called again to complain.  Amazon refunded my purchase price, and unfortunately I was unable to order the product with a reasonable expiration date.

review/summary: Takes me back to childhood!
review/text: I am so glad that Campbell's continues this wonderful comfort food!  This was originally made by the Franco American company who made excellent food in a can. Campbell's bought them out. Now if only the original cheese & macaroni made also by the Franco American company would come back on the market again. That canned pasta is just as great if not even better! People need to complain to Campbell's.<br />There is just something about the larger spaghetti pasta that tastes much better than say the SpaghettiO's. And Chef Boy R Dee pastas are not as good.<br />Anyway, if you want a pleasing delightful experience? Get some Campbell's Spaghetti. It is amazing on a cold day. But we are missing out on the Cheese&Macaroni variety that should be brought back soon!!!

review/text: Hill's Science Diet Puppy Small & Toy Breed dog food provides precisely balanced nutrition to meet your small breed dog's special needs.It is the only brand with an exclusive blend of clinically proven antioxidants.This formula is specially designed to boost immune defenses and support the long life expectancy of small and toy breed dogs.<br />There a myths that allergies are caused by ingredients such as corn but that is not the case. To say that something is a filler would imply it has no nutritional value; when in fact corn is a superb source of nutrients. There is a misconception that whole corn is used - in fact the corn is baked and is much like ground corn you buy. When cooked it is highly digestible.We hear many concerns about by-products in pet food. We need to understand how they are defined and what they really are and what is their nutrient value.<br />By-products is really a play on words. Virtually all ingredients in pet foods are by-products. No one for example uses real chicken breasts as we know it.It's neck and backs of a chicken.<br />Another common myth is that meat should always be the first ingredient, inferring that if that was the case, there would be more meat than anything else in the food. Often the carbohydrates levels are higher than the meats because of the way they are listed in the ingredient panel.Meat first is often the first ingredient only to please the consumer look st the ash levels and mositure levels, and ingreident spliting.<br /><br />I have fed Science Diet to my two dogs and I am very happy with the results. They love the food, it seems to have a good nutrient profile, my dogs have not had any gas or loose stool, in fact the clean up has been minimal so far, poop is much smaller and less of it that ever! I keep searching the yard with the scooper several times a day and there just isn't much to clean up! I can honestly say that they are going HALF as much as they were before! I never would have believed it, considering that there is a considerable amount of corn in these formulas.<br />My dogs were itching, had greasy coats and dandruff all at the same time! I was frustrated and worried for them...after a relatively short time, one of the dogs has virtually stopped itching and the other has decreased her itching intensity.<br /><br />I do wish the food was less expensive.

review/summary: Expected More...
review/text: I received my first bag via a coupon from BzzAgent, for free... since price was not a factor I was more than open to seeing positive changes. I really wanted to give this a high rating because our little mutt really seemed to like eating it and it is the perfect size but I did not notice any positive changes in her. By the same token, I did not notice any major negative changes either. However, the first few days she had diarrhea and after that it went back to almost normal consistency but she was pooping about twice as often. She was also thirsty all the time while eating this.<br /><br />I would say this food is average in quality, the pooch liked the taste but did not experience any of the claimed improvements so I do not think the price is justified. Others may have better luck with it but it just did not work better than our old food.

It's really tiny pieces so its easy for a tiny dog to eat.  I mixed a bit of his old food with it at first and gradually lower the amount of his older food.  Now he is just eating this food. That way there's no stomach upset from drastically changing his diet. I would definitely recommend this food for weight loss and it was neurology vet approved.

review/summary: Won't buy again. Tastes stale.
review/text: I have worked at Starbucks for 8 years.  In November, I left my job to have a baby and my husband and I didn't get coffee beans for free anymore (Starbucks gives you a pound a week).  We tried various brands in the store and didn't like it.  We were looking for something economical and realized that some of the 5 pound bags are actually less per pound than Eight O'Clock Bean.  We used Coffee Bean Direct twice and really liked it.  This time, we ordered this from Copper Moon. It is so stale.. no shine to the beans and it tastes like Maxwell House.  When I started at Starbucks we tried Maxwell House canned coffee and compared it to Starbucks coffee that had been opened and ground for a few weeks and they tasted the same. Fresh coffee gives off gases and cannot be canned until it is stale and that is why most packaging has one-way valves.  I will go back to Coffee Bean Direct.. it wasn't worth saving 3 dollars.

I wanted something more solid and meaty.  If you have one of these microwavable meals every day at work (they are very convenient) then you will want variety, and there are still not that many varieties on the market. So I shall occasionally have one of these, for a change, but the Chef Boyardee remain my mainstay.<br />[PeterReeve]

review/summary: Good cup of coffee
review/text: I like strong dark roast coffee and this filled the bill nicely. Much better than the dark roast Senseo product. You need to be careful to center the pod in the single pod holder and to tap it down a bit. Otherwise, the final product can be a bit watery. It is not difficult to do--you just need to pay a little attention when inserting the pod.<br /><br />I have never tried to make 2 4-ounce cups sequentially as did the previous reviewer, but it does not surprise me that the second cup from the same pod was weaker. It is fairly logical to me that the strongest coffee would be the cup made on fresh grounds (just like a regular drip coffee maker). If you make a single 8 oz. cup or 2 4-ounce cups AT THE SAME TIME, the quality is very good.<br /><br />The best pod, in my opinion is the Kona coffee pod, also available on amazon. However, this one is a good everyday alternative for fans of dark roast coffee since it is quite a bit less pricey than the Kona pods.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I bought a French Roast variety, and did not like it taste at all. It is unpleasantly sour, with smell which reminds of a wet rug left in a dump place for few days. The vendor claims that one pod is good for an 8oz cup. It sounded suspicious, because the pod doesn't contain that much coffee. It fits in a "one cup" tray of Senseo. I tried to brew two 4oz cups, and the first one had a normal strength, but the second one was very weak. Overall I am very disappointed with this product. It costs more than Douwe Edberts brand, but tastes worse. The second star I gave it goes to packaging- it is very convenient, with each pod packed in a separate sealed envelope.

review/text: First, let me start off by saying I appreciate anyone's right to  make a buck.  You create a good product, you deserve to profit from it.  BUT, I think that charging 3 bucks a bottle for a sports drink is unreasonable and disappointing.  I like your product.  I buy it.  I would buy a lot more of it if the price were more reasonable.  It's a shame - you know, Neuro folks- you'd make a heck of a lot more  money in quantity if you'd lower the price. That being said, I like a few of the different products in this line.  Sonic & Sleep I buy in limited quantities.  I would stock Bliss if I could afford to do so. I have not tried the other "flavors"- wait, I did try Gasm. Wasn't worth the price for me.  I gave the Neuro line 3 stars in consideration of the price.  I would have given it 5 stars had the product cost less.

review/summary: Great Product, But Expensive
review/text: I love this drink, I truly do.  It is the first pick-me-up drink I have found that works for me.  I react strongly to large amounts of caffeine (it makes me incredibly hyper) and I never developed a taste for coffee, so my choices for something to keep my brain running when I'm worn out are limited.  Add to that the fact that I'm not a big soda drinker and the choices are even fewer.  Neuro Sonic is a great blend for me.  There's some caffeine in it, but not as much as other products, so it makes me a bit quicker on the draw without making me babble like an idiot like I do when I have too much caffeine.  It's carbonated, which I don't care for, but *lightly* carbonated, so it's not unbearable for me.  The flavor is pleasant and light, not at all overpowering.  The packaging is unusual, so it stands out in the refrigerator at work and I never have to wonder which drink is mine.  The one major con to this product is the price.  As the other reviewers have stated, it is very expensive.  I would probably drink one of these a day if it weren't so expensive.  As it is priced currently, I don't even drink one a week.  I save them for when I really, really need a boost.  So, yes, as another reviewer said, this company could really learn something about the merits of selling product based on quantity.  I would be happy to purchase it more often, if the price were to come down to something more reasonable.  That said, I do still buy it and I do still believe in the product.  The price just dictates that I consider it an indulgence instead of a necessity.

review/summary: Hooked on Sonic!
review/text: I used to be a Diet Coke fanatic. 4-5 a day. At least. I tried the Bliss version first and loved how light and crisp it was. I got my husband to try the Sonic with me and he is hooked now too! I know they're a more expensive choice than other beverages, but I love the taste, the energy I get from it and quite frankly, the appetite supressant effect. For some reason, for me, if I have 2 of these a day I cut way down on the junk I eat and no longer go to fast food places or crave that. Not saying everyone will have the same experience, but for me, this has been a huge boost to trying to give up some bad foods and drinks. I use the Sleep at night and the melatonin works like a charm! Haven't found any variety I don't like but I LOVE Sonic!<br /><br />One note - I wish the delivery settings could be increased to weekly. In my house a case does not last a full week let alone a month!

review/summary: The healthier alternative to soda and energy drinks.
review/text: Like most people I stumbled upon Nero at the gas station, looking for a healthier alternative to soda and energy drinks to give me a boost. That was many months ago, now I get two cases of this stuff delivered a month!  I've tried about five of Nero's flavors of drinks and Sonic is easily my favorite, it's got a tangy citrus taste (kinda grapefruit like) that is not only delicious but also quite healthy as it's packed with a lot of great vitamins and minerals that give you a healthy boost of energy, not a buzz.  I wouldn't go as far to say it really helps to stimulate the brain as it advertises, but it definitely does a better job at boosting energy and making you fell good than energy drinks and soda does.  I've also found myself losing a little weight, as I'd rather drink one of these than a soda and I seem to not be as hungry if I sip on this throughout the day, and at only 35 calories with minimal sugar it's the perfect drink alternative.  Now everyone complains about the price, but for me you can't really put a price on health.  Nero Sonic gives me the energy I need throughout the day, it's healthy, it's helped ween me off drinking a lot of soda, and in my opinon it tastes great.  Now I understand taste is subjective but if you can stomach the taste of energy drinks this is sweet nectar compared to most of those.  Sure you could just drink water and that might be even better for you, but water is boring and in my stressful daily life I need something with a little kick that I look forward to everyday, thankfully it's healthier than most sugary alternatives, and when I add up want I spent on sodas or energy drinks it's really not anymore costly.

review/summary: excellent morning drink!
review/text: I must confess, I'm afraid I'm getting a bit addicted to having one of these every morning -- I realized this when one morning the university store where I usually get it didn't have it; I was really disappointed and found myself looking in three other stores. So beware!<br /><br />I've been trying to switch out from drinking coke/pepsi everyday, and it wasn't until I hit on the sonic that I was really able to do it. I've hardly had any soda for several months now so that alone makes it worth it for me. But aside from that, I find that it really helps improve energy and is mood-lifting -- and unlike soda there's no crash. At the beginning, I was drinking one in the morning and one later in the day, but for me that's a mistake as it keeps me up until 2-3 am and messes up my sleep cycle. Having one in the morning though is really helpful to getting off to a good start in the day. I also find it very useful to drink before working out.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I really like it actually. It has a light, pleasant taste and the carbonation adds a little kick to it -- I love carbonation so its taste and carbonation is part of the reason I find it a useful transition drink away from soda. I actually prefer the NeuroBliss taste with a stronger carbonation and more "citrusy" flavour, but find myself in a better mood and sharper with the Sonic.<br /><br />It's also a pretty low-cal drink (35 cals per bottle), but not completely zero-cal if that's important.<br /><br />I got it from Amazon once, but I find the price here to be on the high-side. Whenever I got it in store I paid $2.35-$2.50 per bottle but here it's more like $2.75.

review/summary: An "Energy Drink" that doesn't overdo it
review/text: I don't know if it's technically an energy drink or not (contains caffeine), but it works.  I first saw these "Neuro" beverages in a local gas station last fall.  They looked appealing with it's simplistic colored bottles and attractive fonts.<br /><br />Now to the good part.  "Sonic" is the best (and most effective) Neuro beverage out there.  I've had "Sport" (which was alright), "Bliss", (which is tasty and fizzy, but doesn't really make me happy), "Sleep" (kinda felt "drunkish"), and "Trim" (didn't do a damn thing 'cause I weigh no more than a featherweight [tried it for taste, and it was pretty bland])  I have yet to try "Gasm" (don't really need it, but i'm curious about the taste).<br /><br />Okay.  The reason why I drink these is because I work not only long, but EARLY hours at my job.  (I start work when it's still dark outside, 1-2 hours before sunrise)  I can go most of my work day without getting tired, (on only 5 hours of sleep I might add) with this beverage.  Even my custom "Starbucks Doubleshot Concoction" (Starbucks Doubleshot Espresso Can, Milk, Coffee Creamer, Whey Protein Powder) doesn't perk me up as much as NeuroSonic does.<br /><br />And don't get me started about "regular" energy drinks.  Those do nothing but make me shaky at first, and cause me to crash later on.  No "focus" factor with those drinks.  Just empty sugar and calories.<br /><br />My verdict is:  That NeuroSonic is an Energy Drink done right!

This product does just as it is advertised.  After drinking I feel alert, focused and ready to take on the task of the evening.  As a bonus it also lifts my spirits! What I love most about this product, is when its time to go to sleep, I fall asleep easily!  RedBull provides energy too, but I often find myself looking at the ceiling when I should be asleep.  It's expensive at $2.79 a bottle, but for a 12 hour edge, for me it is well worth it!

review/text: Love the energy this gives you! Not a wired caffeine type energy, just an awake alertness. I wouldn't recommend drinking this after 2pm if you want to get to sleep before 2am. I tend to drink this if my children get me up early after a long night at work and it keeps me alert all day and in to the evening. My fiancee loves this product as well. If he doesn't have time to make coffee in the morning he will drink this instead (he loves coffee).

review/summary: Good effects but so hard to drink!
review/text: I purchased this on a whim and drank before I sat down to study for a neuro (ironic, no?) exam in the wee hours of the night. I was skeptical about the effects but within the hour, felt more awake. I have to agree that is an energy drink done right. There was no crash, shakes, jitters but natural feeling energy. I didn't focus any better but was able to stay awake long enough to read a few chapters of my book and retain the info. My biggest problem was it is SO SO SO carbonated! It's harsh and the flavor is yucky. I felt like I was downing medicine in order to get my energy boost. The sucralose after taste is especially apparent in this Neuro. I'm drinking the Trim as I write this review and it is much yummier.

review/text: I was very skeptical of this product, but I purchased one since the Neuro representatives were so friendly.  In the past couple of years, I have become very sensitive to caffeine.  I was leery about trying this one, but given my experience with the Bliss and Sleep, I decided to give it a go.  I actually did feel more awake, and experienced no head ache from the caffeine. I'm now a loyal customer of the products, and the line would be perfect if they were sold in glass bottles.

review/summary: Best Drink out there
review/text: My girlfriends son distibutes beverages for a large company in Arkansas,. , I have never liked "energy drinks" and felt that they lowered my immune system so was afraid to drink them on a regular basis,. We went to visit him & he told us about these "new" drinks they just come out with. How they were made, How long they had been tested, What went in them, How much science had gone into making them. We were curious so we hopped in the truck and went to the store & bought a couple of each so we could all try them. the "Neuro" drinks  WOW, they were awesome!! The flavors werent that bad, & the results as far as they claimed actually worked, Brandon &  Callie had been drinking the "Trim" for about two weeks and he had lost 12 lbs, & she had lost 9 lbs, The "Bliss" was like drinking valium in a bottle, It had a slight vitamin taste to it, and put me in a mellow frame of mind,, The "Sleep" after 1/2 a bottle relaxed me enough so I went right to sleep, only recommend 1/2 bottle at night, cap & refrigerate & save for next night. Had a slight pina coloda flavor to it, not bad at all, A couple days later I was feeling groggy and run down, The "Sonic" had a fruity flavor to it without being overly sweet, , It gave me just a kick to wake up without making me feel over caffienated, Or "high",. Was able to concentrate, and focus with out my hair crawling,("like some energy drinks".) Most of them  are slightly carbonated. The "Aqua" & "Sport" are not.<br />  Big kudo's to the "Neuro" people for "inventing a drink" I can drink, Would highly recommend "Neuro" drinks to anyone, everyone, Whatever your flavor or need, "Neuro" has the drink for you, Should warn you they are quite refreshing and quenches your thirst.<br />Im hooked, From now on Make mine a "Neuro"<br />( only bad thing, they dont sell them in Idaho, But you can order online at neuro.com) neuroBLISS, neuroTRIM, neuroSONIC, neuroSLEEP,<br />neuroSPORT,neuroAQUA & neuroGASAM, TRY THEM TODAY

review/summary: Neuro Sonic Review
review/text: I have been happy with the Neuro brand drinks since I tried them the first time at a deli in Manhattan.  I bought a stray Sonic and Sleep or two a few times to help me study and sleep and found them both to be very effective.<br /><br />I am a medical student in the middle of my clerkship year with an old habit of sleeping at very odd hours that really do not match up with my clinic schedule.  When I feel groggy and crabby after getting too little sleep, getting up early, and then having to stand quietly through a 4hr surgery, lecture, or conference, a Neuro Sonic at lunchtime totally gets me ready for the rest of the day when beforehand all my body wants to do is crash.<br /><br />Also, regarding the taste (I read the 1* reviews that complained about it), I find it to be very tasty, but then again I like the taste of Red Bull too.  The two don't taste alike really as Sonic is sweeter with a little more fruit flavor to it, but it's a similar type of 'energy drink' phenomenon where the taste isn't 100% like snapple or orange soda.  Bottom line is that if you're interested pick a single up somewhere and give it a try -- like I said I personally find the taste refreshing so there's more than one opinion out there.  I came here to order a case because buying singles is somewhat of a hassle and I'd rather have them ready to go in the fridge.  It kind of stinks that I can't get them at my local grocery yet, and for cheaper than $30 no less, but I like the product so okay.

review/text: Listen people: forget the taste! Everything is not about flavor...because if you work two stressful jobs at 64 hours a week while trying to maintain a life like I do, you would be begging for something just to help you get through the day. This drink DOES that for me. Not only is it a nice sustained energy boost without the jitters, it also uplifts my mood. This drink has just the right amount of L-Theanine to do the trick. So if you're tired of the irritable, too much caffeine feelings of other energy drinks or the too short boost of coffee this might be the drink for you!

review/summary: Gives Me The Focus I Need
review/text: This past summer I started experimenting with products that claim to give you focus when I go to my pool games. The first one I tried was vitaminwater Attention which has caffeine in it. I initially like the results, but the next week I had taken a nap prior to drinking it and the caffeine became too overwhelming when I played my games and it caused me to rush a bit during my shots. It was my worst performance all summer long. For the last few months I've been drinking a neuro SONIC prior to my games and I LOVE IT! It gives me the focus I need without revving my engine up too much like the vitaminwater Attention did. I see a lot of people complaining about the price, but I don't think it's that big of a deal. Comparing it to the vitaminwater Attention it has A LOT more brain power ingredients, so it's not like they're overcharging you for nothing. They have a far superior product to any Monster or Red Bull or any other caffeine-loaded energy drinks on the market. And it gives you a lot more focus than 5 Hour Energy does as well. So the $2.50-$3.00 price tag is well worth it to me.<br /><br />I also like to mix this with a little sativa and the results are remarkable. I've been doing this combo all season long (started in September ends in December) and I'm the highest ranked player on my team. The best player on our team started the season off slow but he's been picking it up a bit lately so he might catch me by the end of the season. But if I keep up my winnings with the neuro SONIC & sativa combo I think I can keep my spot.

review/summary: Oddly familiar...
review/text: I don't normally buy stuff like this, but my husband was in an odd mood and wanted to try one at a gas station. I don't really trust beverages like this that go so far into selling the supplement side of the beverage that they don't even mention flavors. I'm not against adding nutrients to drinks, but the benefits are limited and I view it as a beverage first and foremost. Anyway, Hubby wanted to try one. After he tried a sip he passed it on to me. I smelled it and said it smelled familiar but I couldn't place it, some kind of vitamin or medicine maybe. He just smiled and told me to drink it. I took a sip, and it tasted very much like it smelled. Then he filled me in on why it was familiar, it tastes exactly like Flinstones chewable vitamins, It even has a kind of chalky texture. In the end it wasn't disgusting, but it wasn't great either. If you really want a drinkable supplement and miss the taste of those chewy little vitamins, go ahead and try one.

review/text: Bought one at a gas station a couple of days ago... loved the packaging! I think that is what sold me, had high hope for a small drink that cost $3.<br /><br />I like fizzy stuff so I thought that this drink might be for me and its a plus if it can help me focus. To my dismay, it was like a sweet & low explosion rather than a refreshing seltzer with hints of juice. It reminded me of drinking emergen-Cs plus 2 more packets of sweetener. I really wanted to like it, but I was looking more for a product between IZZE and Canada Dry flavored seltzer. At the end I could only finish 1/2 the bottle... the rest still sits in my fridge.<br /><br />The mental focus part did not play in, or it was just too insignificant to affect me. I think a lot of people might have a perception of it working, like a placebo. But then again, you can't wish for a 'Limitless' antidote doing the impossible, can you?

review/summary: tastes like sweet red water
review/text: This is a bland boring flavor close to a child's "red" colored drink mix, even when diluted to 3/4 gallon per powder cup.  I drink a Gallon of water with sugar free drink mix per day.  Crystal Light loses 1 star for using a cheap old sweetener, loses another star for being expensive, and loses a third star for being such a lame non existent flavor.

review/summary: Wonderful Malt Whiskey
review/text: Famous Grouse is a very balanced and smooth flavored malt whiskey with hints of oak, fruit, and spices.  Unique and satisfying on ice, this one is my favorite.

review/summary: great way to sample Starbucks k-cups
review/text: I was glad to find this sampler so I could try the Starbucks k-cups without committing to a large supply.

Flavorful.<br />3 - Caffe Verona bold and flavorful.<br />4 - Breakfast blend - weak and bland<br />5 - Sumatra - bold but tastes like "conference coffee"<br />6 - House blend - weak and bland<br /><br />For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.<br /><br />My favorite k-cups are:<br />Starbucks French Roast<br />Starbucks Caffe Verona<br />Starbucks Pike Place Roast<br />Green Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran Reserve<br />Green Mountain Double Black Diamond<br />Green Mountain Revv<br />Green Mountain Dark Magic<br /><br />Other k-cups I've tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold

review/summary: Picture is misleading
review/text: I love my Keurig and like to switch up the coffees I try. I decided to get this so I would have a nice variety of coffee to choose from. I was excited to see the picture, which includes the Veranda blend. However, when I received it, there was no Veranda blend included. Rather, what I received matched the description later on (3 each of Sumatra, French, Cafe Verona, Pike Place, House, and Breakfast). This is fine, but I would have loved to get some Veranda with it. In all honesty, I should have read the description before buying, but the picture is rather misleading. As far as rating the cups themselves, I don't know yet. I've had Breakfast Blend in the past and it's good, but nothing to write home about. I had the House Blend the other day and did not care for it. It's drinkable, but it's probably my least favorite of the K-cups I've tried thus far. (What I have liked in the past: Caribou-Caribou blend, Caribou-Daybreak Morning blend, Starbucks-Veranda blend)

review/summary: Starbucks K-Cups for Keurig Brewers
review/text: This is a real disappointment ! I previously used a Tassimo system and the Starbucks brands tasted as good as you got at the Starbucks store. Then they quite making them so I switched to a Keurig system. This swill they are passing off with the Keurig brewers is terrible. If you looking for a good Starbucks brew, this ain't it !

review/summary: Starbucks, the best for K-Cups
review/text: Got a K-cup machine for my birthday and really wasn't jazzed about the coffee that was included with the machine.  Wanted to try the Starbucks line, but didn't want to buy 6 different packages just to get a taste.  This variety pack fit the bill.  Might be a bit pricey, but I typically only drink one or maybe two cups in the morning.  All of the flavors were great.  Probably wouldn't buy it again now that I know what I like, but if you're not sure or just want to try something new then this is probably a good way to go.

review/summary: IT'S SO GOOD!
review/text: I never had this before and got it only because it was on a give away sale price on amazon.<br />i can't beleve its so good, now let me state first that i'm a big fan of mayo to start (always hellmans/best foods)<br />so this has the creamy goodness of mayo with an extra kick of flavor and can take a everyday turkey sandwich and jazz it up, big time!<br />i now see that there is other flavors to be tried... try it i think you will like it
