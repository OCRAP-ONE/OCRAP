review/summary: Tasty, Crunchy, Filling Snack Bar
review/text: An immediate benefit is that there are 2 bars, each about one-quarter inch think or so, instead of one big thick one.  The consistency is that they are crunchy, but break apart easily.  They are NOT those hard fiber-board bars that make you feel like you are breaking your teeth.  They kind of remind you of a graham cracker pie crust in taste, but with honey and oats.  They are quite tasty, just sweet enough (without being sickening sweet), and they seem to be somewhat filling, enough for a mid-afternoon snack, especially with some water or tea.  So, we have tasty, easy to chew, filling.<br /><br />180 calories in a 2-bar, individually wrapped 1.5 oz. package, the label says the package contains 16g whole grain (of the recommended daily 48g), also contains 6g total fat, 160 mg sodium, 29 g carbs, 4 g protein, 11g sugars, 6% iron, and measures as 2 carbohydrate choices. (I believe that's for a special type diet program).  Sounds like it is relatively healthy<br /><br />Ingredients, listed in the following order:  whole grain rolled oats, sugar, canola oil, crisp rice with soy protein (rice flour, soy protein concentrate, sugar, malt, salt), honey, salt, soy lecithin, baking soda, natural flavor, peanut flour, almond flour, pecan flour.  Contains soy, peanut, almond, and pecan ingredients (for those with allergies.)<br /><br />Update 3/28/10:  Another good thing about these-- I kept a big box of these in the car for a couple of months for anytime I am on the road and need a snack.  Through the temperature changes, they stayed in tact.  Unlike chocolate covered bars, there was nothing to melt.  (I keep these bars and some special tea bags in the car for wherever I am.)

review/summary: Disturbingly addictive
review/text: You don't expect healthy food to be addictive, you certainly don't expect to consider making a special run to the grocery store for granola bars... but these granola bars will do it to you.<br /><br />Now sure I love my chocolate chip granola bars as much as the next person, but one day someone handed me one of these and I've been sold ever since.  I don't know why... maybe the toasty oats and grains, or the honey or maybe its just the fun crunchyness of it all.  All I know is that after eating one, I thank whoever decided to put two in a packet for their genius.  I can easily sit and eat an entire box of these while watching a movie.  If you're trying to be healthy remember - all things in moderation, even these granola bars.<br /><br />The only negative I can see is that with them being so firm and crunchy, there WILL be crumbs, and if you are eating them on the road (replacing breakfast while driving to work) you will need to brush yourself off before striding into the office.<br /><br />PS- The Brown Sugar ones are AWESOME

review/summary: Yummy breakfast on the go!
review/text: These granola bars are one of my favorite things to grab on the go when I am rushing around and don't have time for breakfast before work.  The reason I say "one of my favorite" and not "my favorite" is because they take a backseat the Nature Valley's other flavor of crunchy granola bars, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6IULK">Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars, Peanut Butter, 12-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  The Oats n' Honey variety takes a very close second and I actually prefer the Oats n' Honey variety in certain situations.  Particularly when I am taking the granola bars in my purse for the day or to the beach on a hot day because the Peanut Butter variety gets gooey and melty (not good for sandy hands or a quick snack between appointments without a wet towel or sink nearby).<br /><br />Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars have been a go-to snack for years in my family (ate them all the time growing up) and still remain a favorite.  I am sure that some may find them too crunchy/hard but I prefer the texture and crunch over other brands.<br /><br />Final note, these came shipped from Amazon in perfect condition.  I was unsure as my delivery guy loves to play "kick the box" but the granola bars held up just as nicely as they do in a brick and mortar.

review/text: These were just what I expected them to be. A nice crunchy oat bar. Like an oatmeal cookie. Even though I LOVE raisins, dates etc.... there are times when you don't want bits of sticky fruit stuck in your teeth all day!<br /><br />these are great for leaving in the car as they do not melt or get goey, are nice & neat to eat (although they can crumble a bit!) No stains or dirty fingers! Can you tell I have kids LOL!!<br /><br />Anywways..........we like them plain with a glass of milk or better yet crumbled on top of ice cream or yogurt MmmmmmmmmmmmmmmDelish!<br /><br />So IF crunchy granola is what you crave buy these & you will be delighted!<br />As for nutritional data you can click on Amazon's handy link by the product, but these are NOT for people on a Low carb/Low glycemic diet, unless they are taking a little "sabbatical"!

review/summary: Whole grain goodness.
review/text: Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars are delicious and are my treat of choice when serving my grandchildren, instead of other snacks without any nutritional value. The Oats 'N Honey version seems to work best for those under 5 years old, as there are no nuts, which, for some reason, offends my 4 year old granddaughter (she will eat around pieces of almond and the like!). Perhaps it is just something difficult for her to chew.<br /><br />Yes, these bars do contain some processed sugar, however, they are definitely a healthier alternative to cookies, cakes, and rice crispies treats. Oh yes, and I like them, too! They are quite good with a cup of coffee or tea.

review/summary: Tasty and Crunchy
review/text: Not much to say here except these bars are hard and crunchy with a very nice nutty, whole grain flavor.  Two come in each packet.  They are rather small so one tends to eat both bars in the packet.  My three boys, aged six and under love them.  They are, however, a bit messy to eat, as they tend to fall apart as one bites into them.  Nature Valley is part of big corporate America.  If you judge a granola bar by its taste, though, you should consider these ones.

They do crumble a lot so you will make a big mess eating them, it's unavoidable.  the only complaint is they can't keep them together.  They begin crumbling before you even touch the package.

review/text: I don't like granola, I really dislike granola bars, and my family LOVES these.  Unlike other bars, they are crispy instead of soft and gooey, so they are more like a crunchy cookie.  The honey flavor comes through, which is something I like.  A package containing two bars is 180 calories, with about 6 grams of fat and over 20 grams of carbs - - so, not health food, but very good as an occasional treat.

review/text: I am normally not a great fan of such bars, because despite all the healthy ingredients they contain hydrogentated corn syrup.  Horray,this product contains no such awful ingredient.  And they are very delicious. Crunchy oat with a lovely honey taste - not overtly sweet - just right.  there are two servings per packet totalling 180 calories.  This is a great little snack and quite filling.  Although it is very moorish- so you have better have great self-control!<br /><br />PS: we now order it on a regular basis, which does make it cheaper by at least $1 savings per box.

Perfect with a cup of tea, and one is enough... which is good, because it makes for a satisfying yet not-fattening snack.<br /><br />HOWEVER, to call them "high-fiber" is beyond misleading.

review/summary: Mostly healthy and widely available.
review/text: One of the original "healthy" mass market bars and perhaps still one of the healthiest and tasiest despite the High Fructose Corn Syrup.<br /><br />Prepackaged granola bars are convenient: they are neatly packaged in a wrapping that keeps your hands clean and the bar from melting into your bag. Plus, they keep longer than a homemade bar.  The Nature Valley Oats 'n Honey bar is still one of our backpacking and snack-on-the-go staples for this reason.  We also like that they are all oat and have no crisped rice fillers that many other bars have. We also use this broken up over yoghurt or over cooked fruit to add variety when camping.<br /><br />One thing we did notice recently is that the ingredients list is different for same product in different packaging.  Some list pecan flour and other nut flours while others dont.  While all their different products may be manufactured in the same facility and cross contamination is expected, there IS a big difference as to whether actual ingredients are added to the mix.<br /><br />While there may be tastier options out there and healthier options, the Nature Valley line is the most widely available and the most versatile bar.

review/text: These have a denser oatmeal flavor than most granola bars - in a good way.  The first bite makes it seem that they are not sweet enough but then that is followed up with an almost too sweet after-flavor.  There is good flavor separation between the honey and the brown sugar (syrup) that is used.  There are two bars in each foil and that is the serving size so you seem to get a lot of bang for the buck (180 calories). I bet it would make a great topping for baked apples . . . . .

Nature Valley bars are 100% natural, include no high fructose corn syrup, contain a good source of whole grain, include no trans fat, and total caloric and carbohydrate intake are relatively low.

I'm a health nut and I approve these bars without question [and I'm pretty picky about all the information I have posted above)!!<br />The only minus (if anything) is that the bars are quite crunchy/hard; therefore, if you are one with sensitive teeth, you might want to break down the bars into bite size pieces or soak the bars in yogurt or milk [if necessary]. But, do yourself a favor and try Nature Valley crunchy granola bars!!

review/summary: Oats: A grain ... to support the people
review/text: I have been a fan of Nature Valley granola bars for years.  They come in many varieties.  My favorites lately have been the Pecan Crunch and Peanut Butter bars.  So, I was pleased to learn that Amazon now offers the bars in their many different types.<br /><br />Certainly, Oats and Honey are a classic combination. Oats go way back. Samuel Johnson included a definition of oats in his 1755 Dictionary of the English Language.  I have adapted liberally from his definition for my title.  Actually, Samuel Johnson said: "Oats: A grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland appears to support the people."  Little did he know that two and a half centuries later, England's colonial offspring would enthusiastically endorse oats as a food for people.<br /><br />Earlier this month, I spent a week skiing in Colorado at Vail, The ticket counters were equipped with baskets of the Oats and Honey bars provided free of charge.  It was a nice gesture considering the almost $100 daily ticket price.  The granola bars pack nearly 100 calories for a single bar, and obviously double that for a two-bar pack.<br /><br />I took the Oats bars with me skiing, but I also depend on them for hiking.  An extra 200 calories is what you may need to give you enough energy to get up the last 200 feet to a mountain summit.  The taste is good.  They do not melt.  If you get tired of the Oats, there is always a choice: Pecan, Almond, or Peanut Butter, to provide variety.<br /><br />PS: Despite an assertion that the Oats and Honey bars contain high fructose corn syrup, it is not on the list of ingredients for my bars

review/summary: High Fructose Corn Syrup
review/text: This is a great tasting product, however, it is unfortunately NOT an all natural product as they would lead you to believe. It is a shame that so many manufacturers have started using high fructose corn syrup in their products. Any nutritionist, particularly those dealing with diabetics, will tell you without exception what high fructose corn syrup does to  elevate your blood sugar. It is a manufactured product they would have you believe is completely safe, but look at the incidence of diabetes in this country. Why is the the first ingredient the nutritionist say to completely avoid. It is worse than sugar in what it does to the blood sugar and I can't even get into the ways it helps to create obesity. Too bad, I also stopped drinking Arizona and Lipton iced tea product for the same reason. Hello, out there!! There are natural sweeteners like stevia and xlitol that are truly GOOD for you!!! Why is high fructose corn syrup actual banned in several countries, including Canada? Could it be that the pharmaceutical companies helped to develop and expand the use of this product so they could sell more drugs????? Many foreign countries that pay for universal healthcare must think so. Why else would they ban it to reduce their medical costs?? Hello FDA. Where the heck are you???

review/summary: Nice snack inbetween meals
review/text: I'm afraid I don't have a lot of experience with granola bars. I did want something to take the edge off my hunger between meals that wasn't heavy. These are a bit dry, but very sweet.<br /><br />I can understand the attraction because these contain so much fiber. The issue is that they taste so much more like candy. The amount of sugar in them worries me. There doesn't appear to be much more to these than oats.<br /><br />There are two bars inside the foil. They break quite easily and have a tendency to go crumbly. I found that one packet really wasn't very satisfying. The portion is quite small. For an adult I would say two or three of these would suffice with a large glass of water.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't find anything particularly attractive about this brand. I would have preferred something with a little more volume and taste other than over powering sugar.

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: I decided to try amaranth flour because it sounded like it had so much good nutritive value to it but yuck, it tasted like wet cornsilk...ick, ick, ick!!  I love Barry Farms selection but they are slow in getting their products to you, and although their quality is good they tack on quite a bit of shipping, but if you can't find what you want anywhere else with less shipping, Barry Farms has a good selection and like I said their quality is good. I will pass on amaranth flour next time though as I could even taste the amaranth flour in my flour mixes.  It had a strong flavor and smell, one that I couldn't get past, so I threw it out.  I'll stick to all my other gluten free flours that I really like and there are others that have good nutritive value as well like quinoa flour.

review/text: I went on a trip with the Archeological Conservancy and sometimes they have box lunches--I find the hard boiled eggs and sometimes other items to be rather bland.  But in one of the restaurants we visited, they had tiny bottles of Tabasco.  I took my partly used one on-board and used it on the eggs--terrific!  Once home I searched Amazon and got a 12 pack=6 red and 6 green.  They're small enough to pack in my carry-on: esp. since the quart bag fills up fast and I like to only do carry-on.  So now I can pack my own taste enhancer!

However, she has found that most restaurants don't carry the green, if they carry Tobasco at all instead of a giant selection of wild named sauces all bringing plenty of heat but little flavor.  I used to get the original Tobasco in my MRE's and was thrilled to see the green version available.  Now my wife carries a couple of these with her in her purse "just in case" and we have them in the RV all the time for our camping trips.

review/summary: A versatile and excellent all around cup
review/text: Coffee Bean Direct has a couple of versions of this coffee and all are good. I tried the dark house blend and found it to be just a little too close to that "not quite burned" flavor for which a famous national coffee house chain is noted. This medium house blend strikes just the right note for a general purpose all around coffee.<br /><br />Every order I have placed has seen bags of fresh beans of good quality, consistent size and even medium-dark full city+ roast arrive at my door. Beans are roasted to the point where there is just a small amount of oil evident on their surface. These beans are much less likely to clog your grinder than many darker more oily roasts.<br /><br />The flavor is dark (but not too dark), rich and full bodied. The mouth feel in the cup is very good, thick and velvety, not thin. Ground coarsely this blend is excellent for French press. Go a little finer and it makes a great pot of drip coffee. Run it through a decent burr grinder and go fine enough and it also makes an excellent espresso with good "tiger stripe" crema that is long lived in the cup, and that same espresso makes a great base for milk-based coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.<br /><br />With subscribe and save you're getting a very good quality coffee for pre-ground and not so good stale grocery store coffee prices. I don't hesitate to recommend the CBD Medium House Blend. If you like your coffee dark but not too dark with low acid and deep coffee aroma and flavor, I think you'll like this blend. I know I like it very well. Five stars for quality, flavor and subscribe and save value.

review/text: I bought this coffee thinking it might replace my Trader Joes breakfast blend. But other than the pice, there's no comparison. TJ's House Blend is rich, earthy, smooth, with many good overtones. This coffee - the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWFAEG">Coffee Bean Direct Medium House Blend, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag</a> - is bright and bitter, slightly harsh and nondescript in flavor.<br /><br />It serves me right for trying to save a few pennies on the TJ House Blend, but never again.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWFAEG">Coffee Bean Direct Medium House Blend, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag</a> may appeal to a few people trying to step up from "Mawell House", but a rich, elegant, complex morning coffee it isn't. What it is, is another nondescript entry into the many "E&E" (Elite and Economical) coffees that are fast flooding the coffee aisles.

review/text: This product is excellent! I love the flavor and the pancake syrup scent of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FM9VKS">Capella Flavor Drops Waffle Concentract 13ml</a>! I use this in "protein ice cream", cakes, cupcakes, oat bran, oat meal, cold cereal, protein pancakes/waffles, loaves, egg whites, in milk, in yogurt, with cereal, drinks, in nut butters etc. Great in earl grey tea and steamed milk/almond milk as well! Great to add to raw or creamed honey to give it a slight flavor (blueberry pomegranate is great in honey, the waffle/cake/dessert flavors are great in creamed). The possibilities are endless. It has a wonderful frosting type smell to it, and it really enhances anything you make. To anyone who has not used these products before: They are NOT sweetened whatsoever. Do not expect a sweet taste: you need to add your own sweetener to it. This is a great bonus because it is so versatile and depending on what sweetener you prefer to use (honey, artificial, sugar, agave), you can customize it to suite your taste and preferences. You also only need about 2-4 drops, depending on the size of what you're flavoring and the strength of flavor you prefer. Definitely worth it!

review/summary: A beautiful herb tea
review/text: I like orange flavor to begin with, and when I want a cup of herbal tea, I generally reach for Mandarin Spice. The flavor is a mild orange with a slight tartness and there is a bit of clove overtone, rather like a non-black tea version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BLQ">Constant Comment.</a><br /><br />The ingredients are excellent: Orange peel, hibiscus, roasted chicory, rosehips, blackberry leaves, chamomile, hawthorn, cinnamon, natural mandarin orange flavor ,other natural flavors , cloves and coriander. The hibiscus and rosehip add tartness and natural vitamin C, the chamomile is soothing, the orange and spice are delicious. The color is a pleasant orange-red. I find it doesn't require any sweetener, but if you like sweet tea, a drop of Stevia, agave, sugar or honey won't hurt it. Cold, you can mix this tea 50/50 with juice or fruit punch. The reason to do this is that you can make a juice-punch that is sweet but not overly sugary for people to sip on hot summer days. Kids like to drink juice and if you are concerned about the amount of sugar in juice, this is a great way to drink juice while cutting the sugar in half.<br /><br />It also makes an excellent tea punch with cranberry juice and fizzy water or champagne.<br /><br />We keep a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018A2YIM">3 liter hot water pot</a> on all weekend and pour glass after glass of this herb tea to keep hydrated.

I like my tea very strong and usually do not remove the tea bag while I am drinking a cup of tea. No matter how long I leave the tea bag in, this tea does not turn bitter.<br /><br />This is great hot or cold. In the cold months I often have it with milk and honey, and in the warmer weather over ice with just a little sweetening. Either way it tastes great.<br /><br />If you want a distinctive but not overwhelming orange spice flavor, you will love this tea.

review/text: A Japanese friend of mine pointed out this dressing in a large seattle Asian grocery store and said "oh, that's the best salad dressing we use it all the time at home".  So I bought some and have been addicted to it ever since. Unfortunatly they sell out of this dressing at the store so I've had to order on line.  Its really good marinade for fish too. My husband and I look for excuses to use this dressing and now eat salad everynight for dinner!

review/text: I have been using this product for more that 10 years.  I call it my crutch dressing.  Whenever a dish needs a boost this is the product I use. Try mixing this ingredient with additional yellow miso, sake and chicken stock.  Bring to a boil and poach halibut in the broth. Serve fish and reduced broth over rice.  Delicious!

review/summary: the handy-est dressing around
review/text: Everybody has written about how great this stuff tastes, but I also love the handy, erogonomic shape. You do have to follow the label and "shake well before using" to get the full burst of flavor. I also like the thin skin of the container; just a gentle squeeze is all it takes to get a teaspoon or so of the tangy and ever-so-salty dressing on your tossed salad.<br /><br />My wife really likes it, too. She uses it on everything, even some stuff I can't figure out. I'll find it in the bathroom, on the night stand, even in the laundry room. It's not a stain remover, is it? (lol)

review/summary: I could never find this amazing dressing in stores. Thanks Amazon!
review/text: I found the Pietro dressing at a food show years ago and was so annoyed that I couldn't find it in stores. Now, thanks to Amazon it's available on line delivered to my door! Here's how I first got hooked. The demonstrator had a bowl of lettuce. He put two pieces of the cut up lettuce in a small cup and then added TWO DROPS of this dressing on top. I tasted it and it was HEAVEN! It has a VERY high fat content but that's not BAD. The secret is to use just a LITTLE. Don't just "pour it on". The flavor is so intense that you will taste it immediately. This is one of my favorite flavors of the 4 they offer. Shoyu is my favorite. Even the Pickled Plum is interesting.<br /><br />The company ships fast and has A-1 Customer Service. With the convenience of ordering on line, you don't need to search. Thank God for the internet.<br /><br />Steve

review/summary: I'm not a food reviewer, but this is the best dressing ever.
review/text: Pietro has some other dressings, too, but I've only tried the Shoyu and Sesame and Miso.  A Central Market in San Antonio was giving out samples and they are now constantly sold out.  Everybody I know who's ever tried one of those two dessings has raved about it.  They're fairly similar except this one has a stronger, spicier flavor than the Shoyu (it isn't hot, but does have red chili paste as an ingredient).  You can also clearly taste the sesame seeds.  I've always hated salads and now I eat them daily because of these dressings.  It's also good for an Asian-style slaw if you just put it over cabbage.  Anothe neat thing about these products is that a little tends to go a long way - if you can stop yourself from having repeat servings.<br /><br />Serving size: 1 tbsp, calories 75, fat 7.5 (.8 saturated), sodium 300mg.

Then we couldn't find it anywhere for a year or two and were searching frantically - even calling the distributor.  So glad it is on Amazon now.<br /><br />Don't be thrown by the weird "miso" in the title - this is a great dressing for anyone who likes a slightly sweet, Asian taste.  It is a thinner (not thick, like ranch) dressing.  Well worth the price!

review/summary: awesome sauce and dressing
review/text: We love this dressing! No wonder it gets 5 stars from everyone. It's great on salads, but I also use it for steak, chicken and shrimp. As a dipping sauce it's a wonderful base. Great dipping sauce! I put some in a mini blender and add red wine (or mirin), Frank's original hot sauce, onion powder, and brown sugar. For shrimp add some lemon. I would pit this against any dipping sauce. I have even made some excellent beef jerky with this dressing as the base ingredient with soy. Down side is the price ~ $14 USD a bottle after shipping from Hawaii. Try to find it at a local Asain shopping market, only 7 bucks + tax.

review/summary: BEST SAUCE/DRESSING,  EVER!!!!!
review/text: This is the most delicious sauce, on everything! I'm not exaggerating! The most perfect blend of salty, tangy, & zippy. I use it on everything, but very sparingly (sometimes just drops!), but one bottle lasts for months. A little goes a long way. Great on salads of course, but also steak, chicken, vegetables. It makes "blah" food taste amazing. You can even eat a bowl of plain rice with a drizzle of this sauce. Also delicious on sandwiches and eggs.  The stores in my area can never keep this sauce on the shelves.<br /><br />I've tried all the other flavors of Pietro dressing, but in my opinion, the Sesame Miso is the BEST, hands down.<br /><br />My daughter who is 5 also loves this sauce, and will ask for "the special sauce". With the sauce, I can coax her to eat anything. Did I already say that it is delicious on steaks?<br /><br />Go get some Pietro Sesame and Miso today, you won't regret it!!

review/summary: BLEND of apple and grape juices from concentrate . . . . .
review/text: This Knudsen "Grape" juice box comes in a handy shrink wrap of three boxes, of which you get 27 total boxes in the case. Works out to 70 cents each at this moment in time. This product comes up under Amazon searches for "grape juice" but its really a BLEND of apple and grape juices made from concentrate (with filtered water.) The flavor is not strongly grape (like, for instance, Welchs Pure Grape Juice is) but it's plenty tasty and appeals more to kids, since it tastes like a drink. NO sugar, tho, this is 100% juice! The cartons are shelf stable and only need refrigeration AFTER they are opened, but this juice tastes best served COLD. Buy some! They're a great substitute for Kool Aid and other sugary drinks that kids consume in the Summer! Per carton: 130 calories, 300 mg Potassium, 15 mg sodium, 1 gr protein, and 32 carbs. Manufactured in Chico, California, USA. Kosher Certified.

The doctor switched us to Similac Sensitive Fussiness and Gas (the orange bottle) which helped a little but didn't help him completely.

You don't need to mix water, just shake well and pour.  I have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035LLG2W">Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer</a> and for a 4oz bottle with refrigerated formula, it takes about 3mins to warm up.  I spoke to customer service at Similac and they said, although not recommended and should be done only when absolutely necessary, you can keep a prepared bottle out for up to 2 hours if needed.

review/summary: Great Product / Bad Design
review/text: This product is competitively priced on Amazon -- it's even a little bit cheaper than ordering from the Similac website directly, even with their 15% off discount for first-time orders. Overall, I think the product is great; my son seems to digest it better than the regular milk-based Similac. However, my BIGGEST complaint is that the design of these bottles really really SUCK! First of all, the foil -- once it opens, it leaves behind jagged edges (if you use the cap to open the foil). This causes the soy milk to pour unevenly out of the bottle, and creating a huge mess. And...since the foil is sealed so tightly around the mouth of the bottle, it's impossible to remove it completely. (Once I did try removing the foil completely... only to have foil bits fall into the soy milk. I was lucky to have seen the bits when I poured it into the baby bottle, otherwise it would've ended up in my baby's feed!!) So... instead of using the cap to open the foil, I've started using a sharp knife to cut a homemade spout into it - for easier pouring. Unfortunately, this method doesn't work either, since the milk has to travel over the lip of the bottle, and thus, it spills out all over the place. Again, huge mess. And especially since you're supposed to shake well before each use, there is milk all over the foil spout as you're pouring each feed. So yeah...BIG OL' HUGE MESS!!! Why are these bottles so difficult to pour?!?! Since we've started on Similac a few weeks ago, I have NOT had a good pour. With each feeding, enough of milk comes down the side of the baby bottle and the Similac bottle that I'm losing a whole ounce or two every time. Such a waste!! I hope Similac realizes what a horrible design they've created and improve the way it pours!!

review/summary: Love the product but not Amazons lack of package labels
review/text: I love that Amazon has the ship and save option for the Similac Soy. It's so conveinent and really reduces the stress of having to purchase the formula at the store. However, I am not a fan that the shipping carton doesnt indicate anywhere that the item shouldn't be left in extreme heat. I had 6 cases of formula delivered to our apartment, just like I do every month. This past month the temperature was 90 degrees or higher, not accounting for the humidity. What I think is unfortunate is that in order to determine if the formula was safe for my baby to drink, due to being left in 90+ degree heat for several hours, I had to call the similac hotline. I didn't want to take the chance that the formula was bad because then I would have wasted well over a hundred dollars and possibly made my baby sick. As it turns out the formula can be kept at temperatures of 100+ degrees for 24 hours. My ups man had no idea not to leave the shipments on the doorstep instead of checking back the next day or even having me pick up the boxes from their local warehouse because there is no type of warning or notice on the packaging.

review/summary: Great so far!!!
review/text: After exclusively breastfeeding my daughter for 4 months, I had to switch birth control and started losing my milk. I'm doing a fairly good job and keeping up enough that I can nurse her sometimes, so we are supplementing. I started with the Similac Sensitive for spit up, because she has acid reflux that we have not found any medicene to help. My mom recommended to me trying Gerber GoodStart. I noticed it was a complete milk-based formula and the one I had been using was atleast lactose-free. She threw up over and over again and had the diarrhea with it and that was only one feeding. So that was a waste of $15 on my part. I went back to the Similac for spit up, but noticed she was having green stools. After doing my research, I am thinking she has a milk allergy or sensitivity which would be causing so many of her problems in an otherwise completely healthy baby. I bought the Similac Soy Isomil because it is completely cow's-milk free. I personally think it smells better than any other formula I've ever smelled. It doesn't seem to stain though I haven't been using it for a long time. I love that it's ready to feed as it makes it so much easier for me and I think the powder isn't so great on her stomach. So far she's doing really well on this formula, and surprisingly hasn't spit up since she started it, which is a relief as her doctor was planning on sending us to Primary Children's Hospital to meet with a specialist about her reflux that keeps getting worse. I'm crossing my fingers this works. It's also nice that at Walmart, where I bought my first bottle, this is the cheapest kind of formula other than the store brand. I love that there are the ready to feed bottles as well, since I hate carrying a bottle warmer everywhere I go because my little girl will not take it cold. On the bottle, it says to discard the formula 1 hour after each feeding has started. Being tight on money, I find this a waste, so when she is done, I simply put it back in the fridge and it is perfectly fine. However, if it's been sitting there for too long(4-6 hours), I discard it and clean out the bottle before refilling it. She's been perfectly fine so I'm not worried. I signed up for Similac online so I'm hoping to get some coupons in the mail soon :) Overall, I'm very pleased and would highly recommend.

review/summary: Sloppy Chucks.
review/text: Well, "sloppy Joe's" is what you call hamburger glop on a bun, and my wife just served me a sandwich made with this tuna goo swimming in water with Charlie Tuna on the can, so I decided to call it "Sloppy Chucks".  Solid tuna for me, please!!

review/summary: Great solution
review/text: For some reason, this product has become next to impossible to find in stores.  Walmart used to carry it, but seems to have replaced it with the lunch packs.  I buy these for my cats.  This size is perfectly proportioned.  The 5 oz can seems to have just as much tuna as the 3.5 with a bunch of water.  I'm glad to have found it on Amazon, and this dealer shipped it very quickly.  Will be a repeat customer.

review/text: This solved a problem for me. I needed a way to ship canned goods to my elderly Mother. She loved the size of the cans and Starkist is the best.

review/summary: bulldog & pugs
review/text: I have been ordering these pig snouts from my local pet store paying more than double the price and to my amazement here they are for a lot less! These are giganic snouts 4"-5" each(great for my large bulldog)and my dogs love them. The best part about it is they are highly recommended because they don't break our dogs teeth like bones do but also because they do NOT come from China where there have been issues with our pets getting sick because of what they feed their animals and no control over what goes in the feed. I could not be more pleased!

review/summary: French Vanilla Wolfgang Puck
review/text: Product is easy to use.... Just cut or tear pack open and place into the coffee pot.  But I definitely did not think that the flavor was particularly French Vanilla, even with French Vanilla creamer.  It felt "heavy" on my tongue and had a "dark" coffee flavor which I believe overcame the French Vanilla flavor.  I was very disappointed that I had paid so much for so little flavor. Additionally, when I tried to return the products, the site informed me tht they ewere not returnable (Even the unopened packages).

review/summary: Good first brew
review/text: This was my first homebrew and it turned out really good. Ipa's are my personal favorite beer so thats why i chose this. A couple things, The fermenting went a little faster then what i expected and the the carbonation happened a lot faster then i expected also. Even though i don't think it's a very high alcohol brew, it's got the bite of some of the imperial ipa's but not as hoppy.  over all a great beer, next time i do it i think i'll add extra hops and sugar to boost flavor and alcohol. cheers!

review/summary: Beer?
review/text: Could potentially yield a quality brew if I knew what the hell I was doing. Definitely recommend for a beginner to homebrewing. The only advice from experience I can give is: ignore the directions provided where it says to use cane sugar in the wort. Use malt extract for that portion and then use corn sugar when bottling. Using cane sugar makes it taste cidery, and you'll end up with a little over 2 cases of off tasting beer, unless that's what you're going for.

review/summary: Frontier cinnamon shines through!
review/text: Just had this tea as a latte at a coffee shop.  I am a big fan of Frontier Saigon Cinnamon, and that taste sure does shine through!  No licorice or pepper taste comes through in this chai.  If you love cinnamon, give it a try.  Chai latte:  steamed skim milk, shot of sugar-free vanilla syrup, chai tea bag, steep 5 minutes.  Yum.

review/text: I've impressed so many of my friends by busting these out at parties we throw.  They're way better than those cherries and everyone was asking me where I'd found them.
