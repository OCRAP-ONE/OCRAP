review/summary: BEST Waffle (and Pancake) Mix out there!  5-STARS!
review/text: I'm pretty picky when it comes to waffles.  We spent a small fortune on our waffle maker (Chefs Choice Pro 850) and was determined to find the perfect waffle recipe as well.  So when my husband bought this MIX, I was hesitant - how could anything out of a can be better than homemade? Well, I soon "ate" my words and needless to say was delightfully surprised.  This mix is just as good - if not better - than anything I've made from scratch.  Yes, it's THAT GOOD.  Nothing compares.  I could eat waffles for every meaal thanks to my new waffle maker & Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle mix.  Can't find the mix in local grocery stores so we order it online from Amazon to get free shipping.

review/summary: Doesn't get any better than this!
review/text: We first discovered Carbon's Waffle mix while on vacation at the Kennedy Space Center in Titusville, FL. We stayed at a Fairfield Inn and the continental breakfast included waffles and about everything else you could ask for. But what we kept coming back for were these incredible waffles. I've had nothing like them before. We begged the lady to tell us what the mix was and she brought out Carbon's Pancake and Waffle mix. It wasn't long til we got back home and I ordered it off Amazon right away. It arrived pretty quickly and it was just as good. My boys love them (ages 5 and 3). Whenever I have a day off from work they beg me for these pancakes/waffles. The texture, sweet flavor, and buttery taste make them almost like candy. They are best in a Belgian waffle maker as this accentuates the light buttery taste. We use a Waring Pro professional grade waffle maker. We had friends over the other night and gave them some of these waffles, and of course he took the empty can home so that he could order some for his own family. No doubt, we are sold on these babies!

review/text: This is the same product as used to be carried at Williams-Sonoma, for half their price.  The only difference is that there is picture of a waffle on the can instead of a happy child.<br /><br />It makes tremendous waffles and pancakes, and I know of what I speak, because I am a mediocre and inexperienced cook and can make marvelous breakfasts with this mix.

review/summary: Really, really good
review/text: so i first ordered this on the 2nd or 3rd and i came back on the 11th to reorder another 3pack. Yes, they're that good and i live on my own so i'm the only one who's been eating them. I tend to buy frozen waffles and these are soo much better and cost wise, i think they come out about the same or less. They're more tasty, more filling and i actually freeze the leftovers and pop them in the toaster and they taste great! These are melt-in-your-mouth waffles and i look forward to making them. i purchased the villaware waffle maker with this and i just love it. I've frozen waffle in the freezer from before i purchased this and i can't go back to eating those. I'm a cheapie but when it comes to this mix, i highly recommend. I haven't made pancakes from these so i can't say how they taste but the waffles are SUPER!

review/text: Love this product!!  I used to buy ONE can of malted waffle mix for about the same price, so I decided to try this 3 can combo to see if I could get away from spending WAY too much on one can of malted mix at William Sonoma.  Tastes the same, possibly even better.  My kids love pancakes and waffles, and my whole family loved the first batch I made with this mix.  Probably the best waffles I've ever made.  Next time it is on sale on Amazon I will buy it again.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND I LOVE AMAZON!

review/text: MOST - AWESOME - PANCAKES - EVER!<br /><br />They are very sweet & malty, but I've never had such an awesome pancake, waffle, funnel cake, or crepe as this mix creates.  And the aroma they fill the house with is like being a kid with a hand full of ride tickets at a carnival.  I can't ever go back to my normal shelf varieties - NEVER.  I think I'll stock up for the apocolypse, because if the world does nearly end I think these are good enough to make me not care.  And if society doesn't all fall apart I don't have to worry about ever running out of these.  That's a WIN-WIN.

review/text: I bought this waffle mix on a whim when I saw it while browsing on Amazon.  I am so glad I did.  My daughters love the waffles made with this mix and they do remind us of the ones we eat when we stay at hotels.<br /><br />It is very easy to use.  You mix water, egg, and melted butter with the mix and you are ready for delicious waffles.  We have also made pancakes with the mix and they turn out very nicely.<br /><br />The container the mix comes in is a nice, handy size and stores very easily.  I am using the subscribe and save option which makes it very affordable and assures us we won't run out of the mix.

review/text: Perfect for making light and crispy waffles. My kids wanted chocolate waffles and Amazon is out of stock on it so I changed this mix to work. I added 1/4c coco powder, 1/4c white sugar, 1tbsp vegetable oil, and 1/8c water. These turned out very good! I noticed they stick a little more then the original mix does so be sure to re-oil your iron every couple of waffles.

review/summary: Good waffle mix!
review/text: This is good stuff.  The directions on the can call for one egg plus mix and H2O.  The result is the perfect amount for making two waffles with a Waring Pro Belgian waffle maker.  Thanks to another reviewer for the suggestion of freezing the extra waffle for later use, much better than saving the extra mix. The waffles still need something more, so far I have added pecans and syrup, and pecans and Brown Cow maple yogurt.  The yogurt is far easier and more economical for me than whipping cream.

review/summary: Better Waffles
review/text: I was looking for a light and crispy waffle in my Belgian Waffle maker. The mix I had made decent waffles but they never turned out as crispy or as light as I wanted. Trying this mix I went out on a limb and even though it was a little more expensive I tired anyway. The Malt in the name was what pushed me over to try. I feel that the malt is a little lacking, but the waffles turn out great. I also tried beating my egg white and folding in after the batter was mixed and there was no significant difference, so just make them as the instruction says and you should be happy.

review/text: I purchased this after having wonderful waffles at a hotel. I make these at home almost every weekend. They're so easy, just add butter, egg and water. You can also use the batter for pancakes. They're pretty hard to screw up. They come out golden every time in my waffle maker. I have one of those flip over waffle makers, but I'm sure this batter would work just as great in a non-flipping waffle maker. I've even used the batter in the place of flour if I've run out of flour.

review/summary: Best Waffle Mix by far!!
review/text: I absolutely love belgian waffles. I always look forward to staying at hotels where they have a "make your own waffle" breakfast. Those waffles always seem to be the best. Well, look no further, this is why. I received a Waring Pro flip style belgian waffle maker for christmas. Makes real, deep-pocketed, belgian waffles. Using this mix with that iron makes the best belgian waffles ever!

review/summary: Super but needed to tweak proportions
review/text: I bought this together with the Oster wafflemaker.  I just ordered another 3 cans.  While going through the previous cans I periodically compared this with several "made from scratch" mixes (including yeast-raised).  This was by far the best.  However, I found the final mix too thin for easy use; it flowed over the side.  I resolve this by adding about 25-30% more of the powder mix and find it easier to use, while it improves the texture of the final baked waffle.

review/text: I wanted a waffle mix just like what is available when we travel and breakfast is provided by the hotel/motel.  This mix is perfect.  I just purchased a waffle maker that mkes a waffle when you turn the iron over (just like in motels/hotels).  This mix is great.  I add oil instead of margarine and mix water and milk instead of just water.Bon appetit!  Enjoy

To my supprise we found an incredable offer on Amazon for these exact waffles. We order 3 cans every month and share with out closest friends.

review/text: This product makes great, crispy on the outside-tender on the inside waffles.  The flavor is wonderful, not bland at all.  Amazon's price is far lower than the manufacturer, which makes this a terrific buy if you make waffles just once in a while, or all the time.  Buy it-you'll like it!

review/summary: The real stuff!
review/text: Last year I looked low and high for a good waffle batter that was like the restaurants and hotels.  This not only is like that batter, but it is EXACTLY that batter.  You will see the boxes with this branding on it in hotels and food joints where they have great waffles.  One of the best things is how simple it is to make, just water, egg, butter and mix.<br />I recommend one of the deep/thick waffle irons that flip because this stuff rises into a great waffle.

review/summary: So good I sang a little opera!
review/text: I'm not one to give a product review, but in this case, I definitely want to give my input. My first experience with this waffle mix was at a hotel a couple months ago, now I'm not a big waffle eater, but I had a change of heart with this mix big time! I enjoyed the waffles so much, that I planned to order the mix AND a similar waffle maker like what the hotel had as soon as I returned home. After reading the reviews, I decided to place an order last week. My package was delivered yesterday and this morning my family and I had chicken and waffles for brunch. So delicious!! I had read in the reviews to use milk(for better flavor)in place of the water as per the instructions on the can of waffle mix. I forgot to do that, but the waffles still came out great tasting, light & fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Give this a try, you will be glad you did!

review/text: We have a great waffle maker, but could not find the mix we wanted. Tried many kinds.  While traveling in Washington, D.C., we stayed at the Holiday Inn and in their great breakfast buffet, we found the Golden Malted Waffle Mix and made our own waffle.  Ordered it from Amazon, and the rest is history. It is crispy and has that special malt flavor I love.  We also tried it for pancakes, but we like it better with the waffle maker.  Enjoy

review/text: Great product.  The cans are huge and are a bargain.  You add butter, milk and eggs so they are a little more involved then your basic pancake batter.  The taste is so much better though.  They are light, fluffy and rise a lot.  I haven't tried them as waffles, but I will believe me.  So delicious.  I am ordering other flavors as well.

review/text: After a couple of months on the road and eating breakfast at motels I fell in love with the Carbon 180 degree rotating waffle maker and their batter. So when I got back home I researched and bought a similar waffle maker, but it just wasn't quite the same without the Carbon batter. Now that I have the batter the waffles are simply perfect, and my families weight is increasing. Easy to prepare and use and simply delicious.

review/summary: Easy, Yummy Waffles!
review/text: When I got home from work yesterday, my new Presto Flip waffle maker and Golden Malted Waffle Mix were waiting for me.  I made a batch immediately. The recipe was so easy - egg, water, melted butter.  As I mixed it up, I was afraid the batter would be lumpy, but it smothed right out.  I just used a wire wisk and a few quick strokes - nothing strenuous.<br /><br />Wow! The waffles baked up crisp, golden, and delicious.  We ate them before I could even get them in the oven to keep warm.  My kids begged me to make more for dinner, so I did.  We'll be having waffles very often.  We love this mix (and the Presto Flip Waffle Iron!)

review/text: I read such great reviews about this mix that I really wanted to try it out. I have only made waffles with it so far, but what wonderful waffles they were! Yes it takes a bit more time and ingredients than your average mix, but the result is so worth it. For waffles you have to add eggs, water and melted butter. I used the batter in my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TYBWIG">Presto 03510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker</a> and it was just 3 1/2 minutes to perfection. My daughter liked them so much she was snacking on the plain leftover waffles throughout the day. I think they're best served with real butter and maple syrup or strawberries and whip cream. YUM

review/text: I stayed at a hotel that offered the most awesome waffles for breakfast. When I arrived home I immediately bought myself a waffle iron(waring pro). I tried several recipes that were somewhat complicated and did not taste remotely as good. I came on amazon and looked up the name of the to this waffle batter that was used at the hotel and found it. I ordered six cans so that I would not have to pay shipping. The mix arrived today and as soon as it did I opened it and made waffles. I was not at all disappointed they are just as good and the recipe was very fast and easy.I HIGHLY recommend this product.

review/summary: Meh!
review/text: I bought this mix because Amazon was out of the Stonewall Kitchen mix.  It is easy to review elecronics and such because you can talk about those things objectively. In reviewing things that relate to taste and flavor, its difficult to say anything other than "I don't like it!"  So here is my best effort....the taste, the texture, and the color were all off.  I have only used it as a waffle mix so I can't speak to how the pancakes taste.  For the waffles, the taste was 'too' malty (yes, I know its a malted mix).  Also, the waffles were too dense and it was hard to get the insides cooked and the outside to look perfectly golden.  For me, Stonewall Kitchen wins hands down!!

review/summary: Good but not the best
review/text: I've tried 4-5 different waffle mixes now.<br />I bought this one because there are so many rave reviews on this item on Amazon.<br />But to be honest, after we got it and tried it.  I wouldn't say it's as good as those reviewed them.<br />First of all, it's too expensive.  In 3 days, we ran out one 33oz can and we made a total of 8-9 waffles from only one can!!!  That's too expensive of a unit price.<br />On top of that, we made our own whip cream and our own cinnamon syrup all of which added the cost tremendously.  If we used this mix, we couldn't sell this in our restaurant.<br />The mixer is not sweetened at all.  It is pretty after it's cooked.  Golden brownish color, looks very delicious.<br />I added a little bit of baking powder to make it even more fluffy.<br />I also added different flavors such as green tea powder or marshmallows to make it more interesting.<br />I even tried putting small bits of mochi into the mixer and cook it in the iron.  The mochi got melted and chewy but very hot. So be careful if you use this recipe.<br /><br />Must have a good whip cream with this otherwise the flavor is not enough.

Thanks to Amazon, I can now afford to enjoy sublime pancakes and even more sublimer(?) waffles throughout the year.<br /><br />The praise that the other reviewers have lavished on this pancake & waffle flour is richly (get it?) deserved.

review/text: My wife had been hinting that she wanted a waffle iron, so I got her one for Mother's Day (yeah, I know, I'm such a romantic!  :p ).  She loves waffles, so she started using it every weekend, making us and the kids a tasty breakfast.  The only problem was, there was something just not *quite* right about the taste.<br /><br />We tried all the brands, Krusteaz, Hungry Jack, Aunt Jemima, but never found that certain taste we expected.  Then I remembered that every hotel I've stayed at that offers breakfast displayed a sign that they use Carbon's Golden Malted waffle flour.<br /><br />So, on a lark, I check Amazon, and sure enough, here it is!  I ordered a pack, and three days later (thanks to Amazon Prime), my wife made waffles.  We both agreed - THIS was the taste we were expecting when we thought of waffles!<br /><br />Very tasty stuff, and we can get about 3-4 breakfasts from a single can.

I figured it would be a good idea to order the mix along with the iron, I mean what good is a great waffle iron if the recipe is lacking? :) Well it turns out I put it in the cart twice so I ended up with 6 cans instead of 3...."I sure hope he likes it" I thought when receiving the "case" of waffle mix.<br />He hasn't stopped bragging on his great waffles, had them 3 days in a row. I'm thinking that he will be able to use all 6 cans afterall. haha

We have tried it twice, following the recipe exactly as it states and we found the waffles to be bland at best.  We prefer the Bisquick version which is much cheaper than buying this.  Oh well, we tried.  You can buy waffle mixes at your local grocery stores better than what this taste.<br /><br />UPDATE: Because the order is a pack of 3, we decided to give one to our neighbors to try and see if we were being picky.  They also did not care for this product at all. They said they were dry and had no taste.  They even wondered if the other reviews on here were authentic since they could not understand what was all the fuss about.<br /><br />Now what shall I do with the third can?

review/summary: Overrated
review/text: The rave reviews for Carbon's Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour are a mystery to me. This pancake mix is mediocre. Nearly all of the rave reviews have come from people who use the mix to make waffles. The few who have made pancakes have found the mix to be very disappointing. Although this mix is called "malted," it lacks malt (or any other) flavor. The pancake texture isn't particularly good either. If you live in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, or Kentucky, go to your local Meijer grocery store and buy their brand of malted pancake mix. The malt taste and fluffy texture are far superior to Carbon's, and the mix costs less than half as much. If you don't live in one of those states and are primarily interested in making pancakes, use Amazon to order <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB03SE">Bruces, Mix Pancake Sweet Potato, 24-Ounce (12 Pack)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OEAGCO">Heidi's Cottage Classics Oats n' Apple Pancake Mix, 12-Ounces (Pack of 6)</a>, both of which are unique and much better for pancakes than Carbon's. I haven't used Carbon's mix to make waffles, but I'm guessing that the rave reviews are due to the texture, since flavor is lacking. Carbon's mix is a very fine powder, similar to cake flour, and apparently this results in a better waffle (though not necessarily a better pancake). Since Meijer's mix is also a very fine powder, it would probably also make great waffles in addition to delicious malt-flavored pancakes. Don't let the hype fool you into thinking that Carbon's mix is something special. It's good but not great.

review/summary: Taste Like Cardboard
review/text: After reading all the great reviews and being a waffle lover I had a friend get me a can.  He carried it half way around the world for me.  Followed the directions to a Tee, used my George Foreman waffle grill and it made beautiful golden waffles.  Take away the butter, maple syrup and blue berries and it taste like nothing, cardboard must taste better.  Made my first and last batch, even the cheap mix is better than this, yuck!  Don't waste your money on this tasteless product!  Can I give a half star, or no star???

review/summary: Grossly Overrated
review/text: This waffle mix is good, and better than most, but it is grossly overrated. Yes, it smells absolutely AMAZING, but it is seriously lacking in flavor. Be prepared to doctor up this flour with flavor extracts, sugar, and extra oil.<br /><br />If you want to fill your house with a wonderful aroma, this is your answer. If you want to cook excellent waffles, change up the ingredients and experiment, of course you could do this all purpose flour for much cheaper.

review/text: I dont even know if the product taste any good but I need to give only 1 star for them. I opened the box,they were packed very poorly, 2 of the 3 can which were made of cardboard papers broke in half which created flour all over the box. The only good can was all covered and got pretty dirty, too much work . I am very disappointed and I need to say I never gave 1 star to anything , and this product deserves it.I actually want to return them.

review/summary: Incredible value for this top quality mix.
review/text: Our family owns 3 Pancake and Waffle franchise restaurants.  This is the exact mix that we use in our stores.  Honesty prevent us from using the business supplies for personal use so we buy this mix on Amazon instead - it ends up at about the same price!!  We have tested a few other mixes and recipies that are slightly better tasting, but they are a royal pain in the neck to pre-make, store, and they cost 5-10 times more per waffle!!  Unless you have lots of time to devote to more involved waffle making, this is a 4.9 star product for taste and 5.5 star for ease of use.

review/summary: The greatest waffles ever!
review/text: Having been a waffle lover for more than 80 years I feel that I am eminently qualified to be a judge of what waffles should taste like. Add to that the fact that I had, before retiring, been a Quality Control Manager for 42 years. I know Quality.<br />The only problem my wife and I had with the results was, she likes thin waffles  and I like thick. We solved that problem by making a thin batter and made her's<br />and we then added some more of the flour and made mine. That in turn made us overly delighted with the results.<br />Never having been satisfied we decided to try the mixture on a batch of pancakes and the results were SUPER.<br />We have tried every kind of recipe I can think of and nothing, and I mean nothing compares with the waffles and pancakes we had with Golden Malted Waffle Pancake Flour.<br />Great Job and thanks.

review/summary: a bit too sweet!
review/text: You have probably had these waffles before if you've ever gone to a gourmet ice cream shop and they make those waffle cones for you while you wait.  The waffles are decent, and I suppose most people would like them,  I found them a bit too sweet and too much butter . . so you may have to adjust the recipe somewhat.  I thought the pancakes were horrible using this product  .  . . Aunt Jemimah won't be losing any sleep over this pancake mix, that's for sure.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Pretty good waffles if you like them sweet like a waffle cone . .  Pancakes are not as good as store bought brands.  I wanted to return the unused cans, but Amazon won't let me return grocery products.

review/text: My family and I stayed at a Hampton Inn while on vacation and had breakfast at their breakfast bar. I LOVED the waffles they served! I had never tasted waffles like that before! Months passed by and all I could think about were THOSE waffles. I tried various recipes at home and nothing came close to the texture and taste of the ones I had while staying at Hampton Inn. FINALLY, after alot of research online I found out the brand that they used- CARBON'S GOLDEN MALTED. The day I got my package in the mail I made a batch- they were sooo good- We decided to have breakfast for dinner!!

review/summary: Great Tasting Waffles
review/text: I purchased a waffle maker after enjoying the waffles at a motel breakfast bar.  I tried many recipes, but never got close to the flavor that I was looking for.  When I enjoyed the same wonderful waffles at another motel, I noticed the brand name and found the mix on Amazon.  I don't know why I didn't sign up for auto delivery, but I will when I order again.

review/summary: excellent
review/text: I pride myself on making things fom scratch but this is an exception.  I decided to give it a try. I have to tell you that this is the best waffle mix I have ever had. From the moment you open the first canister and you get that malt smeel hits your nose, you know that this is going to be good. The flavor is rally nice and it is not an overly sweet batter which makes it good for both breakfast and for using for dessert waffles with tofu and fruit. Also I suggest using milk in place of the water when making the waffle batter. It makes for a much better waffle. So if you are on the fence about trying this mix do yourself a favor and order. You will not be disappointed. I first heard about Golden Malted Waffle mix here on this web site. when I was searching for a new waffle maker and saw that on pratically every maker this mix was recommended.

review/summary: Ah, the quest for the perfect malted waffle...
review/text: So far, this is the best malted waffle mix I've used, and while it's close to some of the best waffles I've had in hotels, there's a little something missing... I'm not sure what it is, but I think I'm expecting even more of a malt taste. When you open the can and while cooking, the malt and vanilla aroma is there, but the malt taste, while it is there, is on the subtle side. The texture is great -- crispy, light and airy. Don't get me wrong, this is really good stuff and the best I've ever been able to make at home, but I'm still willing to experiment with other brands to find that grail of the waffle mixes. I also am curious about adding some Carnation Malt Powder to the mix, but that would involve increasing the liquids to balance the mix, and that requires a little more figuring on my part... But for now, this mix is king -- you're sure to enjoy!

review/summary: The best waffle mix we have ever found!
review/text: We love eating waffles at our house, & have traditionally made belgium style waffles from scratch.  A friend introduced us to Carbon's Golden Malted, touting the quality of the waffles it made.  I was skeptical, but definitely agreed after tasting our 1st batch.  The mix makes light and fluffy waffles without the fuss of whipping eggs and folding batter.  The malt in the flour adds a welcome "nutty" taste as well.  This product has never failed us.

review/summary: Good Waffles
review/text: If you are buying a new waffle Iron, or just want some very tasty waffles, this stuff IS really pretty good. Actually, most name-brand Waffle mixes made with an egg and milk in the batter instead of instant with water, with a very light splash of Vanilla will make really good waffles. Be sure to have the  large jar of strawberry preserves and whipped cream and a quality Maple Syrup on hand. I use Log Cabin Maple Syrup. I make a large batch of 7" waffles on Waffle day once each month, and plastic wrap them individually, and freeze them.  10 mins in the toaster oven on 350 degrees makes them ready for eating.  Waffles are way more fun to eat, than dull looking pancakes. And they hold the syrup and toppings better for each bite. Dammit,....I want one NOW.

review/text: Love this mix.  Found this when I did a web search for best waffle mixes and it definitely met our expectations.  Most pre-mix waffle batters are too pancakey and don't get the right texture.  After trying several from scratch recipes, I was beginning to think there was no easy way to make great waffles.  This mix is simple (egg, water, butter, mix) and tastes great.  The waffles are crispy but not dry and the flavor is just right.<br /><br />Definitely will be ordering more of this!

review/summary: Very tasty waffles
review/text: This mix makes very good and tasty waffles. However, they are just very good and do not reach over into excellent or extremely delicious. When you first open the mix, the flour smells wonderful! You get a distinct malt scent and it makes your mouth water. To make waffles, you add water, egg and melted butter to the mix. Once the waffles are cooked, the mix browns and crisps nicely on the outside and the inside of the waffles are soft and fluffy. Upon tasting them, there is only a slight hint of the malt flavor and they are just a bit bland, especially compared to the initial scent of the mix. But the waffles are still very good and get even better with some good syrup.<br /><br />I tweaked the recipe by using half and half rather than water and adding vanilla extract to part of a batch and molasses to another. That substantially improved the taste. As a base mix, this was very good and made tasty if not outstanding waffles. But I can see unlimited potential for tweaking this mix by adding various enhancements and taking waffles to new taste directions. Overall, I enjoyed the waffles and yes, I do recommend this.

review/summary: Definitely an award-winning and YUMMIEST waffle mix ... ever ...
review/text: Have you wondered (or are you still wondering) why the hotel's waffle mix tastes so good, and it seems like you have a hard time replicating the recipe with the waffle mix you got from the grocery stores ?<br /><br />Well, I have and it was baffling! I didn't give up on my wish to be able to make the YUMMIEST waffle at my own kitchen.<br />I went to Amazon.com and encountered this product "Golden Malted" Waffle mix. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL60W">Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour, Original, 33-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />At first, I was hesitant, especially after seeing that it only comes in a pack of 3 -- "I still have those 'failed' old waffle flours in the kitchen, why would I buy 3 to simply try? "<br /><br />After extensive reviews both on amazon and google, I decided to try it as a lot of people gave it good ratings and agreed that it tastes like the hotel's waffle mix.<br /><br />The result ? OMG, the waffle was mouth-watering. I followed the recipe written: Mix waffle flour + eggs + some water + butter.<br />Using a Belgian waffle maker, cooking was about 5 min. The aroma was just heavenly. I paired it with "Grade B - dark amber" Real Mapple Syrup <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a>. (Yes, there are imitation waffle syrup out there!) It was really the YUMMIEST waffle I ever made -- crispy on the outside, moist in the inside and it's not heavy (like pancakes)<br /><br />I have been buying this waffle mix and truly recommend it to those who have been in 'the hunt of the perfect waffle mix'<br /><br />They have the "all natural" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6BFE">Golden Malted All Natural Waffle & Pancake Mix, 33-Ounce Containers (Pack of 3)</a> and "blueberry flavored" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042RNHVG">Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour, Blueberry, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)</a>. I have not tried these. And, I think I am staying with the "original".<br /><br />Enjoy !

review/summary: Comparing waffles
review/text: Having purchased Stonewall Kitchen Waffle mix and thoroughly enjoying the wonderful Belgian waffles, I decided to try Carbone's Golden mix.  When traveling, we have fixed ourselves waffles at the breakfast bar of Hampton Inn and learning that this is the mix used by that chain, I thought it was worth trying at home.  The price differential was a big factor in so doing, I must admit. Though a very satisfactory product, the flavor does not rise to the level of Stonewall Kitchen and my next purchase will be reverting to that product.

In fact, just as good as any restuarant or hotel I've partaken at.  Keep in mind, I'm more of a bacon and eggs person, and now I can't wait to eat a waffles.

review/summary: Fantastic, Easy to Make Waffles
review/text: While on a short vacation, we were at a restaurant that offered complimentary breakfast. At first the spread looked like a standard, medium-priced hotel morning offering. They had cereal, muffins, breads, and juices - but they included some hot items as well.  That was great, but once I saw the Belgian Waffle iron, I was delighted - I love Belgiam waffles, so I figured I give it a try. Well I LOVED the waffles and found out that the iron and oven came from the same company.<br /><br />While I was at the breakfast table, I went online to order the same mix. I was delighted when my waffles at home ended up just as delicious as the ones at the restaurant.<br /><br />I have tried three different Belgian Waffle mixes and this brand tops them all in ease of preparation, consistency of batter, and storage. I have to say, the Krusteaz Belgian Waffle mix has a flavor equal to the Golden brand, but Krusteaz is more expensive, and I haven't found it in a reclosable container with a sealing lid.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this mix, it's delicious!<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: The Best Batter for both Pancakes & Waffles
review/text: The highlight of staying in most motels for me is the fresh waffles you make yourself using the flipping waffle maker.  My daughter bought me my own flipping waffle maker.  We tried a dozen waffle batter recipes before finding Carbon's Golden Malted.  It's the best.  Period.
