review/summary: They'll Go Fast.
review/text: Our boy (17 months) is going through teething and we like to get him foods that he can hold in his hand and bite pieces off. He enjoys it too. He likes a variety of crunchies made for babies, fruit bars and crackers. We've fed him several different kinds of animal crackers. A little while back we were roaming the aisles of our local warehouse store and my wife spotted this four-pound container of Kirkland Signature Animal Crackers. Into the shopping cart it went.<br /><br /> Our boy loves these animal crackers, which is a good thing because we've now got so many of them. Both my wife and I tried them and thought they were delicious. They're nice and fresh and have a slight vanilla flavor. They're all organic and have the seal of approval of Disney. It's a good product and I suspect they'll go fast.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Not real animal crackers
review/text: There's this recent move to create animal crackers that have the consistency of a butter cookie, with artificial flavor and colors. This version is exactly that; mealy, grainy and a faint hint of fake vanilla. Bought them once but will not NEVER purchase them again. Barnum's, which were the gold standard of animal crackers, have changed their recipe to this as well and suck just as bad. At least these are organic!

review/summary: Tasty, but Sandy
review/text: I (like many others in these reviews) bought mine at CostCo for far less than I see it here on Amazon.<br /><br />The flavor of these cookies is very good, and they are not too hard, nor too soft!  There is a nice crispness to them.<br /><br />The characters are almost all identifiable: Pooh, Eeyore, Tigger, Piglet, Roo, and a barely-identifiable Heffalump (from a recent Pooh movie, I think).  And there are quite a lot of cookies in the 4-lb jar, which (incidentally) is recyclable!<br /><br />The downside to them, however, is the sandy texture when you bite into them.  That is the only way I can describe it.  Sandy.  I don't know if it has something to do with the "organic" label or not, but there it is.  To be honest, that sandiness is the reason I will not buy these again, and I would not recommend anyone to buy them.  At the same time, I cannot recommend anyone *not* to buy them, either!  It's simply a matter of preference.  Thus, 3 stars.

review/summary: Hot "Chocolate"?
review/text: This item, though a cute idea, really doesn't live up to its title. The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The "hot chocolate" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasn't fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly can't even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter.<br /><br />If you're looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls. However, if you're expecting something akin to hot cocoa as it is generally understood to be, I would look elsewhere.

Love the taste and aromatic coconut scent.  I think its great she loves it and its different, she loves it and that is the most important thing she feels she now has her own special drink like Mommy when we cozy up to hot drink.  I have to find some more as she is upset she has ran out and we were lucky to find this one at Home Goods, now have to see where I can order some.

I'm not sure if they came from the seller that way or if this happened during the shipping process, but I decided to keep them anyway.  This is the only set of hot cocoas that had a sticker of Raggedy Andy wrapped around the tin insted of it being imprinted on the actual tin. Kids seem to love that it turns blue once it touches the milk or water.

review/summary: Luck O' the Irish Hot Chocolate Mix
review/text: Good thing I got this from the bargain bin or I would really be perturbed. Whatever the claims, this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind. A more correct description would be Coconut flavored drink mix. Apparently the 10 oz rating is including the weight of the "cauldron" because there's no way there was 10 oz of product inside. You might get three cups of "hot chocolate" per container if you like the "flavor" really mild.<br />It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price. Two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won't even be much use as decoration. Look for a better brand.

review/summary: Too good!!
review/text: This halva is so good, once you taste it, you will probably have a hard time staying away from the rest of the package. The carb-protein ratio is 3 to 1, which makes it even more irristible. Aside from the slightly different texture, it just tastes like really good, rich fudge. What other fudge has that much protein and low carbs? I ate an entire package in three days. Then I e-mailed my sister to tell her about it, and I let her know I didn't think I would be able to share any of it, with anybody. (She convinced me I have to share some with her.)

review/summary: Perfect for Picky Eaters
review/text: These dehydrated duck strips are perfect for my two toy breed dogs who are not only picky eaters but suffer from allergies to most other treats. They usually don't care to eat much for breakfast but they gobble up the Quackers that I feed them in place of a meal. They also look forward to a reward of Quackers when they finish eating their evening meal of kibble and frozen raw food. I don't know how I would get them to eat without Quackers and so I need to have them on hand daily.

review/summary: Super Sugar in the Raw
review/text: I love it.  Hard to find in the single pack, which I want for both home and work.  At work, everyone asks for that "brown" sugar.  I love it, and so does everyone else.  The packets insure that you don't overdo it, because this sugar is sweeter (and better) than refined sugar.  The price here is great, and the only thing you have to know is that when you get the sugar, you should probably repackage it immediately into air tight containers, as it does come in a cardboard box.  Hence, the price.

review/text: I was hesitant buying something online that I could just get in my local grocery store. However, the ability to read reviews of other kinds of sugar products (some of which I was familiar with and some I was not), helped vastly in my decision making. For others who are considering buying this pack, I highly recommend it. Whether it's for work or you just drink a ton of coffee like myself, buying in such a large quantity only makes sense. This sugar is also a perfect complement to any coffee type, from bold to mild.

review/text: Yikes the price went up like crazy! I got this for about $14-ish. I think that this is a great deal for the price I got it for but for more than 20 bucks, not. They all came loose in a cardboard box. And 95% of them were full with just a about 5 either broken or had anything in it which is fine. I had to put them in a huge water jug. Sugar in the raw gives a great flavor and perfect sweetness to coffees, teas, oatmeal. I use three per cup. Three packages equals one tablespoon. Not good for iced drinks as it won't melt. I use this for rolling cookie dough before baking. It gives my cookies a shimmer and crunch and won't melt. :)

review/text: I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.

Hoping that all brands will not be so different from each other, I tried Kevala, and was disappointed to find its texture too coarse and dry, as if dried juiced out coconut meat was processed by blender. It does not have the silkiness and softness of coconut flesh as in the other brand. So much for trying another brand; I will stick to the first one I bought.

review/summary: Want to Get Simply Naked? Try These Chips!
review/text: Wow!  These are tasty and have a great texture.  They are thick with a subtle salty taste. They are called simply naked as all they have on them is simply sea salt.  They almost have a bread stick texture. And they are folded over for thickness.  I don't know of a similar chip to compare them to--they have a one-of-a-kind unique appearance and taste.  They would be great for a party. They come across as a quality chip.<br /><br />The flavor is subtle, not overpowering.  They're great with a fizzy drink or as a side with a salad as your main meal.  I made a green salad for lunch and brought these out for a side.<br /><br />Regarding nutrition, there are healthier chips out there with more fiber, less salt, less sodium and less fat. However, these are better than potato chips. They are baked, not fried. These have no cholesterol which is positive.  Sodium is 11% of daily value, fiber is 1%, total fat is 8%.  And you can have 10 chips for 130 calories.  10 chips are filling as these are thick, so that's positive. 5 chips are plenty if you want a bit of crunch.  They remind me a tad of thick chinese fortune cookies but aren't sweet, are thick and salty instead.<br /><br />These chips come in other flavors, one of which is multigrain which may have more fiber and be healthier. Other flavors include: cinnamon sugar, parmesan garlic & herb, Italian harvest, and garden veggie medley. I'd like to try the other flavors, but love these simply naked flavor so much, it's hard to imagine liking one better.<br /><br />For a fairly non-guilty chip, these are worth trying. They are tasty!

review/summary: Good product, but beware, the recipe on the box is gross
review/text: The recipe on the box has the main ingredient being 2 cups of water.  I have never heard of water being the main ingredient of a pudding, it makes a watery tasteless pudding.<br /><br />I used this recipe that another reviewer posted<br /><br />� cup tapioca<br />2 cups milk<br />2 Eggs<br />1/3 cup sugar<br />pinch of salt<br />1 tsp vanilla<br /><br />I didn't follow the cooking instructions that the other reviewer posted, I just threw it all in together (well, except the egg, I tempered that in at the end) and cooked it on low for about 15 min.<br /><br />It turned out really good, I think that this tapioca pudding would work well without the egg if you just added some more tapioca to thinken it up.

review/summary: Bought on a manager's special and hated it
review/text: Recipe and cooking instructions don't work.  Tried numerous times to fix and happened on someone commenting to try something that is realistic.  I gave 2 stars because it's sold with nonexistently working instructions but works somewhat if you figure it out eventually.  I've made lots of tapioca over the years...albeit regular and not organic...but this was terrible and I'll never buy it again.  Overpriced and not nearly as good as the normal stuff and I'd appreciate proper instructions.

review/summary: Worst recipe ever
review/text: I bought a box for wholefoods and was so excited to make tapioca pudding last night!  What a disappointment.<br /><br />Who ever created the back of the box is a total dimwit.  And shame on me for following them blindly.<br /><br />First of all, they claim that one teaspoon = one serving and that there are 17 servings in the box.<br /><br />Second, the recipe never mentions the temperature you should cook the pudding, whether you should cover the pot, etc.  It simply says to boil water, add tapioca, cook for 17 minutes.  But if you do this on high, you will burn your pot dry.<br /><br />Third, the recipe calls for 3 teaspoons of tapioca.  Given what I wrote above, you might think this would be three servings.  Instead, this makes, as expected, maybe an 1/8 of a serving.<br /><br />Finally, the pudding was inedible.  It called for 3 T sugar, 3 T tapioca and coconut milk (which boiled down to nothing).  Ugh!  It came out to be a sugar syrup with hard tapioca balls.  Terrible!<br /><br />If you want a decent recipe for tapioca pudding, try soaking the tapioca overnight, and following the recipe on the website Simply Recipes.  I made the pudding the day after and it was truly excellent.

review/text: I really enjoy this coffee.  I like my coffee smooth and mild with no bite or acidity.  This one fits the bill.  The praline pecan flavor is very soft and doesn't overpower the coffee at all.  I add milk and Splenda, so if you like your coffee black, your mileage may vary.  I think this one definitely isn't for someone who enjoys bold, dark roasts, but it's perfect for me.

review/summary: Pecan Praline K-cups
review/text: Let me preface this by saying I used to drink coffee in my creamer.  I love the idea of coffee, but mostly for warm creamer and that lovely raw sugar taste.  When the casa received a Keurig from Santa, luckily his elves knew to include some tasty flavors beyond the variety pack and this is one of the extra cartons which was included.  I have tried my other cartons (mostly hazelnut, vanilla, and caramel flavor combos) but this one is my favorite.  It is mild and sweet (I usually drink breakfast blend, I am not a dark roast kind of gal) with just enough flavor to accent my creamer obsession.  I could drink a carton a week easily, and it's exceptionally suited to Caramel Macchiato or Vanilla Latte cream... In my opinion, the flavor could be stronger (the praline, not the coffee!) but brewed on the smallest setting, it's just lovely.  Have a feeling I will be ordering only this flavor for myself exclusively from here on out. Obviously, as you can probably tell, I am not a coffee connoisseur  in the least, however if you are you should conclude this is likely not the brew for you.

So beware you won't get the rice which is pictured above and you will pay premium price for it too, such a disappointment.

review/summary: Best "white" rice I've found
review/text: This parboiled basmati is the best "white" rice I've found. It retains most of the benefits of brown rice, being parboiled to retain nutrients. It has noticeably better taste and texture than the non-basmati rice. This rice saw my wife and me through a diet revision program (Dr. Stephen J. Gislason's "Alpha Nutrition Program" for diabetes control or IBS). After a few days of no food we faced weeks of gradually adding more and more "dangerous" foods back into our diet and observing the results. The first food we were allowed was this parboiled basmati rice with soft cooked vegetables like zucchini, carrots, broccoli, and peas. Frankly, those meals were delicious and felt good. I still enjoy many meals of this basmati rice. I tried to switch to a cheaper "long-grain" rice but it was gritty and tasteless by comparison. This is the real food :D

review/summary: A great cheese of the world finally getting international recognition..
review/text: Its about time Spanish products started getting their due.. The most famous (rightly so) Spanish cheese, Manchego, is world class, and is really tough to beat.  Try some with some fig cake, or some quince paste, or drizzled with olive oil garnished with rosemary..  Serve with a fino sherry, manzanilla, or any number of red wines (depending on age of cheese), and you are guaranteed a winning combination..  Sliced, melted over a great burger, with a roasted red pepper and a hearty glass of earthy zinfandel = heavenly joy..  Cube and marinate in Spanish olive oil is also a treat... I have had no problems with iGourmet so far, so I can't comment on their customer service - all of my orders have been shipped quickly (1-3 business days), without issue.  Their Manchego is much better than I can get at the local gourmet grocery stores.  They have great specials and offers, so I have to count myself as a big iGourmet fan.  Regardless, Manchego cheese is so good, you'll undoubtedly be back for more.. and more..  and more.

review/summary: SMOOOOOTH COFFEE!
review/text: This is the first time I've ordered (or tasted) Douwe Egberts coffee, and I'm impressed. This is a quality coffee, (this "House Blend" tastes like an easy-done medium roast), and it tastes great. What impresses me most is the nice mellow flavor, and the non-acidic "smooth" composition. Its smoothness reminds me very much of several high-quality Kona coffees that I've experienced in the past. I'd definitely recommend this coffee to friends.<br />My only unpleasant-surprise was that I ordered 18 half-pound bags, anticipating giving some as gifts during the upcoming holidays, but the coffee I received was packed in generic (silver) restaurant half-pound bags for use with industrial food-service coffee makers, which were marked with the "Sara Lee" label, (because Sara Lee owns the Douwe Egbert brand). So without the cute Douwe Egbert signature-bags, I'll be keeping all this coffee for myself, (but as I said earlier, ... it's great coffee, and it was a great sale-price, so I don't mind at all, ha ha).

review/summary: Decent sauce, but apple overkill.
review/text: First off, this isn't a bad sauce. It's actually pretty good. However it's far from being a true apple bbq sauce. It's very sweet, no sour or bitter taste about it. The only thing I didn't like is the artificial apple flavoring - it's a bit overbearing on the rest of the flavor of the bbq (almost of the point of tasting "jolly rancher" like).<br /><br />In all an ok sauce, 3 stars. -1 star for high fructose corn syrup, -1 for too much apple flavor.

review/text: I bought these noodles at the local Fred's discount store.  Because of the low cost, I assumed that the noodles would not taste so good, but because they were so cheap, I went ahead and bought them.<br /><br />well, let me just say that the taste was a pleasant surprise.  I eat a lot of noodles because they are a quick, easy way to prepare lunch during the work week while on break.  These are the best tasting noodles I have had in some time.<br /><br />The noodles are soft, not chewy or tasteless.  The season packet that comes with the package also helps to flavor the noodles nicely.  Add water to the plastic bowl and microwave 4 minutes and you are done.  It's that easy.<br /><br />they also make a great side dish for dinner meals as well for the family.  And the price cannot be beaten- great price for such quality noodles.<br /><br />* definite recommend *

review/text: first off, used only part of the flavor pouch....love ramen but the flavor dust is a bit much in full force.  I was surprised by the added sugar in the flavor packet.  It is teriyaki after all, but not the right kind of sweetness.  Noodle texture was off, but edable.  i.e. at no time eating it, did I think teriyaki noodles, and I like teriyaki.<br /><br />Ok, so high end it isn't.  It was alright overall, and if you don't think about it too much, its not bad.  The veggies were a bigger surprise, as a lot of small bits went in, but actually had large pieces of green leaf material after cooking.  If using as a starter to a bigger meal, I think I would just start with a ramen pack and build from there.  It seemed to need more water than it called for.

review/text: I love these.  I can't fully explain why, but the first time I had them was in college from the local corner store at around 3am, and I have been in love ever since.  Granted, they are not healthy, and have limited redeeming qualities except for the speed and price.  The price on here is fairly ridiculous, but if it drops to less than $1 a piece that is what you'd get at the grocery store.  I am thoroughly confused about the microwave problems people have had, I have made these in about 8 different microwaves and never had a problem, so maybe people need to read directions better.  All in all, cheap, delicious, unhealthy noodles that are delicious any time, but especially so after a night out.

review/text: I ordered these, thinking (hoping) that they would taste similar to the same item manufactured by "Nissan". They arrived timely and packaged well without any complaints, however the taste is nothing at all compared to the quality of the Nissan brand of teriyaki noodles. I loved the four cheese flavor in this brand, but the teriyaki beef is really awful (in my opinion).  I would definitely opt for Nissan brand in this flavor next time. Not even my teenage son likes them in this brand.

It's nutritional value is also very lacking because they don't give you enough vegetables. It's only a morsel about the size of a 1/2 tablespoon. 0.5/5 for nutrition. The portion was also very small. 4 ounces + 1 cup of water makes a a very measly 12 ounce snack. 1/5 for nutrition. The fact that you have to microwave it for 4 minutes destroys many of the valuable nutrients compared to boiled noodles. 1/5 for texture.

review/text: Our dog is a very strong chewer and we are always looking for something that is safe for her to chew, but will keep her interest for extended time. Tried the reindeer antlers and she enjoys them, but once they have been chewed on she loses interest. Not so with the moose chew.  She chews on it until she gets tired.  There have been no sharp edges or shards to injure her. I bought a 2-pack to try and the first one has lasted a few days now.<br />They are expensive compared to rawhide or pig ears, etc.  But it has held her interest longer than nylabones. Haven't seen any bad digestive reactions so far.

I ordered the largest size possible because I know my corgis like to chew the heck out of these.  They love these.  I've discovered they prefer the flat ones to the rounded type.  One that was sent in this deal was just a little curved, which makes it harder for their stumpy legs to hold while chewing, so they "argue" over who gets the un-bent one!  If I hold the crooked one then they will chew it but they definitely like the flatter one best!  A very good value if your dogs are chewers!!!

review/summary: Great Natural Treat
review/text: These moose antlers are a great natural treat for my small dogs. I bought the first antler piece because my trainer recommended  it as a preservative-free product. The pieces I purchased through Amazon are small but for little dogs like my 7 month old Chihuahuas they will last a long time. I prefer these over bully sticks or rawhides because they do not cause any tummy upset or difficulties with the pups' stool. For small dogs like mine, just a few minutes with a bully stick today means a rumbling tummy tomorrow. When I first introduced the antler piece, the female barked at it and ran away. The male immediately took to it so his sister had to give it a try. Now she loves them as much as he does. They will sit or down or just about anything to get their antler. Another plus is that I will let them bring the antler onto my lap! Not so with a slimy bully sticks.
