review/summary: Stick with the original
review/text: I use the original Spectrum shortening in my baked goods and have always been pleased.  When I saw the butter flavor on sale I picked it up.  Bad decision.  The butter flavor tastes chemically and leaves an unappetizing film in your mouth.  It does not taste of butter at all.  Stick with the original Spectrum.

review/summary: Pretty nice
review/text: The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in.  The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package.  Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt).  It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather.  I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not "loose" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern.  Per the box, store in a cool, dry place.<br />Nutritional info:<br /><br />Servings per container: 1<br />Calories: 120<br />Total fat: 2g (3%)<br />Saturated fat: 1g (5%)<br />Trans fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 50 mg (17%)<br />Sodium: 1360 mg (57%)<br />Total carbohydrates: 4g (1%)<br />Dietary fiber: 0g<br />Sugars: 2g<br />Protein: 22g

review/summary: Has most of what you want in a Jerky...
review/text: ...in that it's chewy, beefy, and has a long shelf life. Jack Link's Peppered jerky is a tad too peppery for my liking, so I expected the teriyaki flavor to be just as robust. Instead, it is mild. Still really good, however! One word of caution, although it's addictive, eat in moderation, or your sodium levels will be off the chart.

I even gave them a second try the next month and they were all moldy AGAIN. Terrible company. "Subscribe and save" users should form a class action lawsuit like done against Netflix when they gave new subscribers the latest movies, leaving the old B movies to the long term customers.

review/summary: Like licking a salt cube! 1470mg of Sodium!
review/text: After trying the teriyaki flavor of these beef steaks, I decided I would try another flavor so I ordered these peppered ones.  The flavor is really like throwing a salt and pepper shaker into your mouth.  You never really get a chance to taste the meat since your tongue is overwhelmed by this cloyingly salty, stale pepper flavor.  The worst part? There is 1470mg of Sodium in a single package, which is a whopping 61% of your daily value of sodium for the ENTIRE day.

review/summary: Good snack!
review/text: Have order three boxes in total now. I bring one as a snack to work almost everyday. Soooo much cheaper to order from Amazon than to buy at a gas station. Some reviews say they've had 'moldy' packages. So far I've only had one single package that tasted a little off. The rest of the box was fine. Some jerky strips will have a bit of congealed grease on them, I just wipe it off. Perhaps those folks with the 'moldy' packages were mistaking grease for mold? I will continue to buy this product from Amazon and will always have a box on hand in my pantry. (Oh, of note, these strips are made from WHOLE strips of beef, not the "chipped, chopped, pressed and pattied" variety, and it is very lean. Lots of protein and only 70 calories a package. 'Beats a package of potato chips any day! They are a tad salty, but so are potato chips - and I always have something to wash them down with too!)

Since jerky is more expensive by the piece, I recently restarted the subscription... only to cancel it after the second shipment. It's nasty. I got two boxes of it and don't know what to do with it. It's old, moldy and disgusting. I am very disappointed with this product and recommend people avoid this until the company steps up and improves the quality. It may be a better deal to buy it in quantity, but it's not when you can't even eat it.

review/summary: Best Jerky / Beef Steak! Best to buy it from Amazon!!
review/text: I have not yet purchased this product FROM amazon, BUT as soon as my box from the Jack Link's Site is gone I will forever buy it from Amazon alone! This (Jack Link's ORINGINAL Beef Steak) is my absolute FAVORITE jerky and has been for years! I've spent way to much time and gas looking for it at near-by stores only to be disapointed and settling for either Jack Link's other products or O'Boy Oberto which are both fine, but for me it does NOTHING for my beef jerky cravings! It is true it is quite salty but what good beef jerky isn't???? My husband a fitness/gym nut LOVES this jerky as well as the high protein content! I also LOVE the extremly low fat content as I cannot stand chewing on leather or fat that never chews away! This product is not only healthy (aside from salt), filling, great tasting, and a great snack thats easy to eat it is also CHEAP! At least in my perspective! On Amazon it is an amazing $10.00+ cheaper (when including shipping cost) than the same box from the Jack Link's website(kicking myself in the butt for that)! I will absolutely be setting up auto shipping for this product!

review/summary: Less Additives than other Packaged Jerky
review/text: It's tough to rate a food item as everyone has their own tastes. However, I think when it comes to store bought beef jerky, Jack Link's is about as good as they come. Most companies add a ton of extra garbage to their jerky, including sugar. You'll sometimes find 8-10 grams of sugar in some other brands. But with Jack Link's you are getting only 2 grams, and a taste that is comparable. And while all jerky is high in sodium, I realized these are a bit less than most competitors.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is just good beef jerky without all the hoopla. A perfect healthy snack for someone in need of a little extra protein during the day. It won't beat the stuff coming direct from a butcher, but it's better than most of the other one's you'll find at a convenient store.

review/text: It's a nice price for a good jerky.  I try to keep loaded up on protein, and these jerkys are easy to just have lying around in case I feel like having one.  They taste pretty good, they're very low in carbohydrates and fat...<br /><br />But they're too salty.  I don't mean in a "Gee that's more than the Surgeon General recommends" kind of way, but in a disgusting kind of way.  Maybe if you have a really high tolerance for salt it's no problem, but I think most people would agree...anyway I get the Teriyaki flavor, with 440 mg of salt per oz.  The Pepper and the original flavors, at 770 per oz, are just too salty for me to want to eat.<br /><br />Amazon also has like alligator and elk and duck jerkey for sale...think I might give those a try once I run through this box.

review/summary: Thick and chewy, not traditional jerky but delicious nonetheless
review/text: I am in search of a good jerky and just had to try these.  I guess I paid little attention to the label "Beef Steak" versus beef jerky.  These pieces are thick and chewy and very peppery (in the original flavor).  I [personally find that I have more of an affinity to the regular, thinner sliced jerky over these "beef steaks" ... but we bought two boxes and are certainly enjoying them.<br /><br />These 2-ounce packs are filling, packed with protein and provide a great mid-day energy boost.  They travel well and the Jack Links brand has not let us down.  With so many varieties, we will be trying more.  These were a pleasant surprise and were different.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is a thicker cut, 2 oz packs have 1280 mgs of sodium per serving.  Quite a lot!  Also, keep a toothpick or dental floss nearby, you'll need it!<br /><br />Very enjoyable nonetheless.

review/summary: That's what she said!
review/text: This is big!  It's about a foot long and they has a pretty good girth to it (that's what she said)!  It's not as soft as normal jerky you find in the bag - I think this stuff is made differently.  It's tough and salty (that's what she said).  It's not the best tasting Jerky I've ever had, but for the price it definitely exceeds my expectations.  I've tried the Oberto brand jerky sticks and they were not very good at all.  And with 23g of protein and only 2g of fat in each stick it's pretty good for you!  One stick is pretty much a meal, though.  I find myself working on it for about 30 minutes before I down it all (that's what she said).<br /><br />Goodnight everybody - i'll be in town all week!

review/text: I've tried the hickory and peppered so figured I'd try the cajun too since I like spicy food. It has a nice kick to it but it's not too hot, at least in my opinion. The spicy taste lingers in your mouth for a bit but it's not a hot burn. It's not as tasty as I'd like but overall it's good and I'll order it again. My favorite is the peppered though, great taste and just a little spice from the pepper.

review/text: This product is pretty good. With 26 or 27 grams of protien and low in fat, it is great for gym enthusiasts or people who want to stay healthy by eating healthy. I personally am a body builder and I'm looking to eat as much protien as possible everday. I definatly noticed an upgrade in performance in the gym and during the day when I take this. Although the cajun flavor is a tade too spicy for me at times. Like my eyes will get red and my nose will start to run. Other than that it is delicous. I will probably try the Teriyaki next.

review/text: Good brand.  They must pay their sales people a lot tho.  I saw these in stores for at least 50% more and convenience stores.... well, who has a wheelbarrow that big to haul around their change in?<br /><br />Send a lot of Jacks Link's steak strips and jerky to the American GIs in the Sand and found ordering it this way to be much more pliable and easier on your jaw than the same brand in Mart type or warehouse membership stores. If you send any to the heat like that, this is a much better product so there's a little time allowed to still have decent jerky arrive.  Steak strips and jerky are better liked than the nuggets tho..

review/summary: Try it in strip form and from somewhere else
review/text: I usually buy the Sweet&Hot jerky strips at Walmart and love the taste. I decided to try the 2oz stick from Amazon and was disappointed for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1. They came with expiration date only 48 days away. I've bought a couple of grocery items from amazon and this seems to be a common pattern. I've also read reviews complaining about the expiration issue on other Amazon grocery products. I love shopping from Amazon, but this reason alone may stop me from buying perishables from them again.<br /><br />2. These sticks are not nearly as soft in texture as the strips. Maybe it's because it's almost reached its expiration date?<br /><br />3. The flavor is not exactly the same as the strips. It tastes more or less the same as regular beef jerky. A bit of hot (as most jerkies are), but not much sweet. Again, is age a factor?<br /><br />I've tried many brands and flavors, and Jack Link's Sweet&Hot is by far my favorite. Get it in strips.. and get it from you local grocer.

One package serving is 57% of your recommended daily intake of Sodium.  This is one of the highest content of sodium I've found in Beef Jerky.

review/summary: A Real Nice Tea
review/text: I bought this tea without reading any reviews or any knowledge of the Ceylon Tea Company and I'm happy I did.<br />First off, the price is very reasonable for a tea from Sri Lanka. Second, free shipping is offered for this product, reducing the cost even more. But the most important point about this tea is the taste, that is why I'm writing this review.<br />When I opened the package, the smell of bergamot and tea was great. The bags come in a foil package inside of a box, they are not individually wrapped. I boiled (not quite a boil... probably around 200 degrees) up some water and let the tea bag sit for 3 minutes. What I got was very aromatic, nice and dark and the taste was outstanding. What a treat. I have tried different steep times, and really, this tea is hard to mess up.<br />I highly recommend this Earl Grey and will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Nice alternative to processed sugar & artificial sweeteners
review/text: These raw sugar packets are the same ones they use at Starbucks. If you've never had them, the sugar is coarser and chunkier than refined white sugar. The flavor is like a very mild brown sugar, and the color is about the same as the paper packet. It dissolves best in hot or warm liquids-- adding it to a cold beverage will result in most of the grains sitting at the bottom of your cup, and even in warm liquids you'll want to stir thoroughly. I didn't count the packets, but the box was quite full. I did not find any empty or partially filled packets as I placed them into plastic containers to keep for long-term use in the office. I do not think it has quite the sweetening power of refined white sugar. Also, I do not know how much better raw sugar might be than refined white. I do like the flavor in coffee and tea, and found this package to be a good value for anywhere you will be going through a lot of sweetener packets and want to give your guests more than a couple of choices.

This vendor shipped all the 1200 packets in one box.  Had some spare time so I counted them.  Order came up short 8 packets, 3 of the packets were empty and many of the packets were almost empty.  I'm thinking maybe there were like shorts fills and was why the price was a littler cheaper.  I guess you do get what you pay for.

review/summary: The Best That Timothy's Offers!
review/text: I do like my coffee on the Dark end of the roasting scale, and this offering from Timothy's delivers.  It is a nice smooth, smoky blend with even a hint of crema at brewing.  It also holds up well to cream if that is your preference.  The Extra Bold delivers the added punch that I routinely seek in my coffee, although I must admit that the 'Espresso' name is a bit misleading, as I have yet to find a K-Cup that delivers the full zing of a shot of espresso.  Either way, in the K-Cup genre, this one is among my favorites!  Give it a go!<br /><br />Pricing here at Amazon is excellent - just wish they offered the variety of makers that I have found at other online sources...

review/summary: Most Delicious Way to Get your Wakeup Zinger
review/text: I am a coffee drinker of the first order. I used to drink a couple pots a day, but now I've cut way, way back, so now that I'm not into quantity, I'm into quality. I really enjoy, really savior a good cuppa joe. I've given up my Mr. Coffee and now have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig Home Brewing System</a> and I make my coffee a cup at a time and I really love it. It only takes a minute to make a cup and each cup is different, depending on my mood.<br /><br />I've been drinking K-cup coffee for a couple years now and have more of these little cups in my house than you can shake a stick at. For awhile I used a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E">Chrome Carosel</a>, made by Keurig, but I had to keep filling it and also it was kind of clumsy for me. Besides, my coffee affliction is way to huge to be held down to a little spinning coffee merry-go-round.<br /><br />For the first few months my coffee problem went spinning out of control. I had boxes and boxes of coffee in my pantry, refrigerator, cupboards, garage, even in the trunk of my car, but now I've sort of got my gourmet coffee disorder in hand and down to twenty-eight flavors.<br /><br />For Breakfast I have my favorite seven and they are: Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Fair Trade Nicaraguan, Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Bold, Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend, Tully's French Roast Coffee K-Cups, Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast, Timothy's World Coffee, Morning Blend and Coffee People Coffee, Wake Up Call Bold.<br /><br />For Lunch I have my favorite seven and they are: Gloria Jean's Coffees Hazelnut Coffee, Emeril's K-cups, Big Easy Bold, Gloria Jean's Coffees, Black Gold Extra Bold, Timothy's World Coffee, Private Blend, Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Parisian Nights, Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian La Vereda and Gloria Jean's Coffees GJ Special Blend<br /><br />And for dinner, yes I drink coffee in the evening as well, but that's not so bad, considering I don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, don't eat sweets and eat very little meat. Sometimes I'll eat meat, but not often, so a cup of coffee with dinner doesn't seem so bad, considering. If it kept me up at night, well then that would be different, but it doesn't.<br /><br />Anyway for dinner I'll drink one of these seven: Tully's Full City Roast Coffee, Gloria Jean's Coffee, Mudslide, Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend, Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups Dark Magic Extra Bold, Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark and Gloria Jean's Coffee, Classic Reserve.<br /><br />And then there is my absolute favorite, number twenty-two and that is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZH8NA">Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso</a>, a Timothy's World Coffee.<br /><br />I keep my k-cups in three large assorted tupperware tubs, marked in red sharpie, of course, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. So when I reach into the breakfast tub for example, I never know which of the seven flavors that I'm going to wind up with. I don't drink coffee during my meal, but afterwards, instead of desert. It's a quiet time for me. I think and reflect over my coffee as I delight in each and every sip. I know for some, having twenty-two different flavors of coffee in my kitchen might seem a bit much, maybe even a bit quirky, well everyone's gotta have their quirks, besides, I've cut way down.<br /><br />Now, about that twenty-second flavor. When I absolutely have to have an extra cup during that quiet, coffee drinking them, then that's the flavor I go for. How often does that happen, when one cup isn't enough? Only about once a day. Still, from two pots a java a day, down to four cups, is a pretty good thing, I'm not as wired as I used to be, but let's face it, I'm still running on coffee. That's not so bad though, better a coffee crutch than something else.<br /><br />In my opinion these are the twenty-two best cups of joy in the whole wide world. At least the best twenty-two flavors I've come across in the hundreds I've tried. But please don't take my word as gospel, everybody's different. You have to dive right right in, take a chance, try several flavors till you find the one or the twenty-two that you like best.

review/summary: A great everyday coffee
review/text: This is a good choice for everyday drinking of the highest quality. The extra bold contents make for decent mug-sized Ameerican coffee cups; and though the name is "Espresso" the result is pleasant for non-Espresso coffee drinkers. For a darker flavor more akin to Espresso, try this company's "Midnight Magic". I find the quality of this Canadian company's coffees at least as high as the more costly comparable products from a certain highly publicized large New England roaster, and it's an opportunity to give our Canadian friends some business while gaining highest quality and good pricing.

review/summary: Best Morning Coffee Ever!
review/text: After drinking Starbucks every morning for the past 6 years, I got tired of the taste, cost, and increasingly rude semi-stuck up staff. I thought they were the servants? Never mind. After purchasing the Keurig machine and using up all of my free K-Cups, I began researching all of the available coffee brands and types for that extra bold, yet not bitter taste. I read numerous reviews online and at the end everything pointed to Timothy's World Coffee Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly the best tasting coffee I've ever had. It's very bold and yet you don't taste any bitterness at all. I look forward to my morning coffee at my office and miss it on the weekends. If you like the bold taste of Starbucks and yet hate the bitterness and burned taste, you definitely need to give this coffee a try.

I generally don't favor French roasts or very strong coffees, but I found this to be satisfying, so don't be scared away by the extra bold label.

review/text: My mother and sister bought me the K-Cup coffee maker for Christmas and it came with an assortment of K-Cups with it. After tasting Timothy's, I decided that was the taste of a rich cup of coffee that I liked. I then went on line and found this at amazon and signed up for the automatic shipment program. If you like a dark roast coffee, then this is the coffee for you. It's not to bitter like expresso, but more like a deep french roast. You can't beat the price, and with the automatic shipment you will never run out.

Even brewing on the smallest-cup setting doesn't yield a strong cup of coffee.  What happened, Timothy's???<br />I'm guessing Timothy's has reduced the amount of coffee in the K-cup.  Or maybe I got a bad batch.  Too bad... now I have to find another K-cup for my coffee subscription.

review/summary: This must have been a bad batch...
review/text: We ordered Timothy's Midnight Magic and the Rainforest Espresso on subscription. The MM has been great, and the taste of the RE is very good (although we like the MM best). Our problem with it is, we must have gotten a bad batch. We've had four of the K cups so far expel just about the entire contents of the K cup in grounds, and we're not halfway through the batch.<br /><br />We re-read the Keurig instructions to be sure we weren't doing something wrong, and we're not. This is apparently a defective batch. Now, I know based on previous Amazon experiences that Amazon would replace this in a heartbeat, no questions asked; but we've already drunk half the coffee and I just don't think it's fair to expect a full replacement when only a small percentage of the product is unacceptable. But at the per-cup price, even one defective K cup is a real drag--not to mention the trauma of downing those mud-thick grounds first thing in the morning when you're not anywhere near being awake yet!<br /><br />Hopefully, Timothy's will do a little QA and find out what's going on with their production process that would allow this kind of thing to happen. Because we really do love their coffee.

review/summary: TIM'S EXBLD RF ESPRESSO REVIEW... BLAH, BLAH, BLAH
review/text: Okay, I just tried 2 boxes of Tim's Ex.bold RF Espresso because I wanted to try a flavor that reviewed as opposite to the Gloria Jean's Breakfast Blend I had just finished.<br /><br />Well, this is it.... Mud! And it's excellent mud at that. The reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, is because it sort of tastes like they added "bold coffee flavor" to the bean itself. It's hard to describe. I believe most coffee companies do this type of thing to help enhance their flavors, but I could really taste that, if that makes any sense to you?<br /><br />I just ordered Coffee People's Donut Shop because I wanted to try a somewhat milder roast. If I don't like it, it's nice to know I can trade it at Yahoo's K-Cup Exchange (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/K-CUP/) for something I do like. I can review the Espresso there as well.

review/summary: Finally! A great, strong k-cup
review/text: This coffee is great - I can brew it on the middle (out of 3) cup size and it's still nice and strong, but without the bitter after taste of so many of the other coffees. The last bold K-Cup flavor I tried was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9WSLY">Emeril's K-cups, Big Easy Bold, 24 Count, 0.85-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> which was OK but still not quite strong enough!<br /><br />One of the K-Cups was broken in one of the boxes that I received, and so there were coffee grounds scattered around the boxes when they arrived, but it's not a big deal since all the others were fine, and it's not like it was a gift or anything. I contacted Amazon customer service about it and they resolved the problem VERY quickly and beyond my expectations. I'm so pleased and will absolutely buy these again and will not hesitate to order other grocery items from Amazon.<br /><br />I have been so disappointed with a lot of the 'extra bold' K-cups, I was actually thinking of bringing my old coffee maker back just so I could brew some good, strong coffee again! Thanks to reading the other reviews, I decided to give Timothy's Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso a try and I'm so glad I did :)

review/text: This is the one coffee that will satisfy the "strong coffee" drinker in your family.  Most of the kcups out there are weak at best and I've tried most of the dark roast styles (diff. brands).  I've tried punching a hole in the bottom and pre-soaking the kcup to help intensify flavor.  It works to a point but it negates the point of owning a keurig due to the time it takes to do it.  I am typing this as I drink my first cup and I was finally able to use the larger cup setting and get a full cup!!  I will try the smaller cup size when I want the extra zing.  Not a true espresso flavor but it is a great rich coffee that smells as great as it tastes.  Thank you Timothy's and Amazon!!!!!!!!

review/summary: The Winner
review/text: This is the hands down winner of the K-Cup full body, dark coffee battle. Don't get this if you like the "weak, watery" morning blends, Nantuckett blend, etc. If you are drawn to Black Magic, Black Tiger, Dark Magic, Eclipse, etc. (I've tried at least 10 bold/extra bold varities)then this is the best of the batch. The espresso name is, of course, useless and misleading. There is not and will never be an espresso shot made with a K-Cup machine. For that, pony up for a Nespresso and get the yellow/blue pods.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is as close to French Press as I've found in a K-Cup. I think it is Sumatran or a blend including Sumatran as it has that earthy flavor. It's the first K-Cup that I expected to see "mud" in the bottom of the cup after finishing. I had not been that impressed with other Timothy's pods but this is as good as it gets.

If this is the machine you have, than this is the coffee you should look into. If you're in the market for a new machine, give Nespresso machines a go instead.

review/summary: Close to Perfection
review/text: Two years ago if you gave me a cup of coffee I'd say thank you and probably not care about the flavor.  Well, I'd care but not be fussy.  I always preferred fresh ground coffee and something with a fairly bold flavor, but I wasn't that picky.  Over the last couple of years I've gotten more and more picky.  Before Christmas my favorite was Jamaican Blue Mountain brewed fairly strong.  It's a wonderful coffee with a very smooth flavor but a little on the oily side.  Then along came Keurig....<br /><br />My work started using Keurig machines about a year ago.  All they have is Green Mountain and I started with Columbian Supremo, then I tried Dark Magic Extra Bold.  I loved the flavor but don't care for the finish, it's a little harsh and bitter for my taste.  I flip flop between French Roast and Dark Magic daily at work.  But for Christmas my wife bought me a B60 Special Edition.  I've been experimenting at home ever since.  Diedrich French Roast did not impress, Sumatran Reserve is quite nice, Lake and Lodge was quite a surprise and didn't last long (reminder to self - order more of that...) and finally I have tried this Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso.  AWESOME!<br /><br />This coffee is bold, flavorful, it has a slightly sharp finish but is not bitter like Green Mountain Dark Magic.  I am currently drinking my first cup made at medium sized cup from my B60.  I think a small cup would be a blast for breakfast or after dinner.  For those who like a bold taste but maybe a little weaker I think this would even stand up to going with the "Large Mug" size, and even my Sumatran Reserve didn't stand up very well to that.  In the end, if you like a strong, flavorful, smooth cup of coffee that doesn't get bitter at the end, this is a great cup-a-joe!

review/text: This one is the best of the 6 Timothy's k-cups I've tried along with Midnight Magic  Nice bold flavor. If you like lite blends, don't get this. The lite blends I've had, Morning blend, Italian roast to name a few just don't cut it with me even when I brew the 5.25oz setting.<br /> I'm used to drinking espresso at home on a superautomatic.  The Keurig is OK for my cubicle at work and I don't have a desire to go to Starbucks and spend $4 during the work day so maybe after 4 months or so I'll break even.  If you get the K-cups on sale, it comes to 40cent a cup. I can live with that.  BTW, I'm not supposed to have a coffee machine at in my cube.

review/summary: Love the dark flavor
review/text: I truly must say I love the Timothy's brand of K cups, I have yet to try one I didn't like.  I love the german chocolate, but I wanted to try a darker brew...and this one filled the bill.  I tried this on the size down from the travel mug setting on the B70 and it was truly rich, dark and satisfying; I can only imaging trying this on the lower settings.  If you love a darker, more intense tasting coffee, this is the brew to try.

review/summary: You want strong, rich, and smooth?  This is your K-Cup.
review/text: I love the dark roasts, but most darks have some bitterness and bite.  This one is very dark, and yet very very smooth.  My favorite of them all, I brew this Rainforest Espresso up and add in about 1/4 milk and have such a great smooth cup that I never need to set foot in a coffee shop again.  Try this once and you'll be back to get more of it, Timothy's outdid themselves with this one.  A+++++++++!
