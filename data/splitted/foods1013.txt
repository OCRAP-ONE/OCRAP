review/summary: The Best Stock Base Available
review/text: I've been experimenting with stock base lately.  It's a lot more convenient that carrying cans of liquid around.  The quality varies greatly from one brand to another though.  This brand, MTG, is the highest quality available at any price.  Read the ingredients, then taste it, and you'll be a believer.  I would buy any of the MTG products.

review/summary: Better than Better Than Gourmet
review/text: After using this brand of stock/sauce starter, I've always been disappointed in any other brand.  More Than Gourmet products get harder and harder to find, as Whole Foods and a local market used to carry the larger sized items.  More Than Gourmet makes everything I use it for better than it would be without it.  Make your cooking taste better!  Use this product!  From Your wanna-be chef.

review/summary: 3.5, more like it
review/text: The whole line is just a little above average but consistently has fallen short in the flavor taste. When I first saw it in amazon it said it was concentrated forms of chicken, beef, vegetable, etc. I bought the whole line but for the likes of me the flavor eluded me. Of almost hard texture it did not taste like chicken at all (when I used chicken, of course) and so it was with the beef, veal. The glowing reviews failed to mention this of perhaps having used Minor's for quite a while I was expecting any particular flavor to be enhanced by a factor of 10 (at least) and that was not the case. It certainly can be used (for the money you better believe it will be used) but it does not impart a strong taste of the chosen bird, animal or veggie. I have tried a similar product from Williams-Sonoma and even though it was more expensive, the taste was there. For now I will stick with Minor's where the Turkey, Chicken, Beef, Seafood, all taste how they are supposed to taste and wasn't that the reason why I bought it in the first place?

review/summary: Tiny Packets
review/text: I ordered this pack because i love Sour Patch candy and had never tried the EXTREME version, well it's great stuff but not so extreme. To me it's more tame and less sour than the typical Sour Patch candy but it's still great. The thing i didn't like was the tiny retailer sized individual packets, they are so small and contain a palm full of candies, i expected a lot more for my money. You get 24 packets in the bulk box but overall it seems like a lame deal. 5 star candy, 3/5 for the bulk box price.

review/summary: Very nice cup of tea
review/text: I'm something of a tea freak, chugging down gallons of black, green, and herbal teas, both served hot and iced.  I've never had lavender tea before, and decided to try it on whim.<br /><br />  I got my tea from Pier Mall with lightning speed, despite it being in the middle of the Chrismas shipping season.  It brews up very nicely hot.  The lavender is pretty strong, giving a very pleasant floral aroma that makes the whole room smell nice.  I think that the flavor of the actual green tea was a bit overshadowed by the strength of the lavender, but it was still present.  It was a relaxing brew, very enjoyable.  I haven't tried it iced yet, but I have no reason to believe it wouldn't be good that was as well.<br /><br />  A somewhat different flavor in tea than what I am used to, but I think I  could become used to this real fast.

I did an experiment and I placed half of them at home and half in my office. The ones at home are on a window sill where they get bright light and no direct sunlight and they are A LOT more of a "vibrant" green then the ones that I have in my office which get direct sunlight they're not doing bad just that they could be green-er. Overall, very happy with my order and I can't wait to reorder again seeing as how the price dropped by $3.00 YAY!!! :)

review/summary: Don Julio Review
review/text: When acquired in Mexico, Don Julio easily wins the battle for superiority with Patron for the title of smoothest premium tequila. It is more cost-effective, and more delicious. However, it has been my experience that Don Julio tends to take on on a sour taste when purchased from American stores. This may be due to extensive exposure to sun and heat during shipping to said stores. In its purest form, this tequila is world-class. I am somewhat skeptical of purchasing it from the internet due to shipping-related integrity issues. However, I will submit an additional review upon receiving this product via the lowest priced seller. In the meantime, viva Don Julio.

review/summary: Formula changed dramatically
review/text: These new formula Potato Buds are horrible.  Betty Crocker changed the formula recently and the result is the worse instant mash potatoes ever, as compared to their original version that was the best in class.  Now the texture is sticky and gummy, and there is no potato flavor.  To make it even worse, there is a disagreeable aftertaste that remains for several hours.<br /><br />I strongly suggest trying a small box from your local store to try, before committing to this new version.  I think you will find that any other brand is better.  The change by Betty Crocker is a big mistake, and it will result in a loss of customer loyalty, including mine.

review/summary: Stop!!  Read this before buying this product!!
review/text: If you have bought Betty Crocker Potato Buds in the past, you probably liked them and that is why you would consider buying a case of 12.  This is not that product!  Betty Crocker has retained the name, but completely changed the product inside the box.  These are no longer "buds", but flakes that make up into an awful, heavy, sticky, gummy, pasty, mass.  The box says, "fluff with fork" like it always has, but fluffing this stuff would be akin to trying to fluff thickened wallpaper paste.  Plus, even if you are oblivious to texture in your food and on your tongue, the flavor is unacceptable and leaves an unpleasant aftertaste.  Potato Buds have gone from the best instant mashed potatoes I have ever tasted to the very worst, without exaggeration.<br /><br />To literally add insult to injury, the representatives have defended these changes by talking about things like "...coming into line with industry standards..." and,<br />"...assuring continued availability..."?????  What?  Bottom line though, is that they, rather than taking their customer's responses under advisement, defend their position and indicate that they have no intention of changing back to the original formulation.  They have the effrontery to suggest that consumers who are complaining just didn't follow the directions correctly.  I made them a second time, before I threw out the rest of the box, just to make sure I had not made a mistake in following the directions.  Nope.  They came out just as bad the second time as the first.<br /><br />To find out what others have to say and to see the company's responses, go to bettycrocker.com, click on "forums" in the drop-down menu under "home" and check out the thread, "New Potato Buds Are Terrible".  While you're there, look at what they've done to "Betty Crocker Supreme Brownie Mix."  You won't want to buy that product, again, either.

review/summary: Potato Buds have been ruined
review/text: I could just bawl.  This is just one of my favorite products that have been discontinued or "improved" in the last couple of years.  I loved Potato Buds for thirty years and I will never buy them again, instead I'll try all the other brands.  I got at least four people (who said they would never eat instant mashed potatos) hooked on Potato Buds, because they were so different and so good.  Now, they're not buds any more.  They're a powdery concoction that has to be contained in a plastic bag, not poured straight from the box.  I thought companies spent millions on consumer research before launching a new product, but somebody definitely screwed up here.  They do not taste better at all and the consistency is not pleasing.

I tried to give it zero stars, but it wouldn't work.<br /><br />I have been making Potato Buds for many years.  It has been my favorite brand and I have tried many.  I made my own slight changes to the instructions on the box to suit my taste and got accustomed to making them the same way every time.<br /><br />But ever since Betty Crocker changed the formula, there is no way I can make these taste good.  They used to be tasty real flakes of dehydrated potato, now it's more like a bland powder.<br /><br />I just came today to Amazon to try and find the old formula and didn't realize until now that so many feel the same way I do about the present formula.<br /><br />I have no idea why they changed it and I can't believe they are blaming the consumers for the bad taste.<br /><br />These are horrible and I am going to be another of the many who are going to find another brand.<br /><br />Maybe if enough people abandon buying these, BC will get the message and change them back to the way they were before, but I'm not holding my breath.  But I did have to hold my nose while eating these.

review/text: I am in the midst of an awful 24-hour bug.  It had me puking all last night.  Even water has been a hurdle to keep down.  These Smooze ices have been available at the grocery store I work at for a while.  I bought them because I was starving and unsure what would stay down.<br /><br />These little treats taste great and are actually quite filling. I love both coconut and pineapple, but those flavors are often over-sweetened.  Not so with these.  So far, my shaky system hasn't had a problem.<br /><br />I didn't shake the box up before freezing it.  The result?  A little blotchy in consistency.  Some parts like a cold pudding, others like icy fruit. Still, that isn't the reason for knocking off a star.  I did that because I don't like the way they are packaged.  It is too easy to bite off a piece of the wrapper.

review/text: These are the best frozen fruit pops(?) I've ever had. I absolutely love em, and if I could I'd eat several a day I would. Storing is convenient since I don't have to freeze them right away.<br /><br />It's ridiculous how much I like these. I feel like a kid, but they are seriously that good. You get the fruit flavor which tastes like you're actually eating the fruit, not overly sweet..then you get the slightly creamy yummy flavor and texture of the coconut milk (I normally don't like coconut, but coconut milk is different). Perfect flavor combo, plus the ice that cools you off when it's hot. Perfection!<br /><br />At 50% natural vitamin C in each of the pineapple wedges, I love that that I can actually benefit from my indulgence. When my kids ask if they can have one, I'm more than happy to say yes because they are not loaded with a bunch of artificial sweeteners, colors, and whatever else you find in regular Popsicles.<br /><br />FYI: I've also tried the mango, which I like, but the pineapple is my favorite. The mango has a little less vitamin C (40%) than the pineapple, but the mango I can eat more of since too much pineapple irritates my mouth.

review/summary: Very Good Horseradish Sauce Excellent on Beef But also good on__________
review/text: I was very pleased with my purchase of this product online<br />as it has been very difficult to find it recently in the local stores!<br />  Hopefully it's just sold out because it is a very good product<br />and they will get it back in stock soon!<br /> But Amazon.com's price wasn't too much more than the regular<br />store price when divided by the 6 bottles!<br />  And it arrived at my door faster than I expected it to considering<br /> I didn't pay extra for faster delivery.<br />The package arrived in good condition and I was pleased to see that the items<br /> all had over a year until they expired!<br />  Plenty of time for my family to use up the six bottles considering we like it<br />in and on so many things especially meats, sandwiches, baked potatoes, Etc...<br />we even use it as an ingredient in a special salad dressing.<br />Anything we want to add a little extra flavor to!

review/text: these ume arare (assorted rice crackers) are a wonderful snack. the combination of the many different classic rice crackers together with wasabi peas and a little seaweed makes for a great and healthy alternative to regular crackers and snacks. the taste is excellent- there are so many flavors and textures here-some sweet, some salty- some dense, some light... just a delightful and crunchy snack that has something to please everyone.

review/text: These Barksters by Loving Pet are the the only product on their line that is made in the USA. My dogs loved the Loving Pet Sticks but when I read they were made in China, I threw them away and refuse to buy Loving Pet's many other products until they are made in the US. As for these Barksters, they are made with only four ingredients and all are healthy ingredients. All of my picky Chihuahua's love the treats, or I should say they loved the crumbs. I rated these healthy treats 3 stars instead of 4 stars because the crisps were all broken up and were in crumbs.

review/summary: Nice, Healthy Treat for Dogs
review/text: I love these healthy dog treats. My dog has trouble with a lot of processed dog foods and treats. These are a great way to give her a little something extra when she's a good girl and not have to worry if she will get sick or have an allergic reaction. I will warn you, though, they often arrive broken in pieces, even though they are packed fairly well. They are very delicate, crispy treats. I usually break them down into pieces anyway, so it isn't much of a drawback for me, but it may bother some of you.

review/summary: My Dogs Love These!
review/text: Ok, let's be honest. "Dogs will be dogs" and mine love just about anything edible,  but they go absolutely bonkers for these little crisps.  I feel good about giving them these as snacks or for training, for a few reasons.<br /><br />First, just like the box says they're "guilt-free"; made with brown rice and beef, they're wheat & gluten free, low fat and only 12 calories per treat -- so I feel good about not giving them "junk food", per se.<br /><br />Second, they're light & crispy -- like a puffed rice, so the pups aren't being weighed down by a heavy dog biscuit full of corn & sugar.  Lastly, the dogs REALLY like/crave these, so they've been a great tool for training, when I use the crisps as a positive reinforcement for good behavior.  When I'm doing repetitive action training over & over again (like teaching my one dog how to shake), I'd rather give him 10 of these than 10 pieces of hot dog or chemical-laden mushy dog snacks.  These brown rice & beef Barksters accomplish both of our needs and I'm actually rewarding him with something good for his body and his spirit.

review/summary: My Maggie Lives for Her Treatie-Time
review/text: My Maggie L-I-V-E-S for Her Treatie Time<br /><br />Every evening, after the dogs have eaten and played outside until bedtime, it turns into "Treatie-Time." Both of my girls, Lucille and Maggie, are allowed two treats, or sometimes three each if they really beg. They have to sit or down or do something special to "earn" their treatie, but it's a special time for us.<br /><br />I value my dog's health, as I'm sure you do. I want them to live a long time and have a trouble-free existence - no scratchy skin allergies, etc. Therefore, I've explored using organic treats, and have even purchased some expensive ones from a local dog bakery. I must tell you that the "girls" were underwhelmed with those treats. Despite their healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Therefore, when I was approached to review the new brand of organic treats for Barksters, I was ambivalent. Organic treats haven't been very well received in my household in the past, but I was game to try them again.<br /><br />I believe in organic treats, but if the girls don't eat them, it's really money down the drain. Especially since we're not depending upon the treats for total nutrition, I'm also concerned with treats being of the the low-calorie variety. I was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuit-y treats contained over 500 calories in each one. That's terrible.<br /><br />As I opened the two packages of Barksters, one was Sweet Potato and Chicken Krisps and the other was Brown Rice and Beef Krisps, I was glad to see two things on the packaging:<br /><br />1.The treats are made in the good ole' U.S. of America. This is important, especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in China.<br /><br />2.The treats are wheat free and gluten free.<br /><br />The second is most important for my "grand-dog" Dutchy, the Siberian Husky. Ever since he's been a pup he's struggled with digestive issues. Our vet recommended that he have a gluten-free diet, which has helped him tremendously. We don't want to ruin his digestion with treats.<br /><br />As we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy Georgia Sunday afternoon, I broke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be. I was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes - very puffy - and wafer-like, instead of a biscuit. And, I must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs. They couldn't get enough of them.<br /><br />The wafers tended to break, but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group. They didn't mind if it was broken in two, that just meant two treats - Bonus!<br /><br />The treats cost approximately $10 per box which contained 5 ounces, which seems pricey. But, since it's a "luxury" item, I can go with the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats, especially since they didn't look like the ones they're used to getting for their "treatie-time."<br /><br />I'd highly recommend that you try Barksters!

review/summary: Amazing dog treat.
review/text: Our dogs love Barksters (all varieties), so when my friend needed to potty train her new rescue dog I recommended them to her.  They worked like a charm!  Since they only have 12 calories and can be broken into smaller bits, she could give a piece every time the dog went out.  It's hard to describe their texture.  They are puffed and crispy, but not fried.  They are crinkly like a potato chip but much thicker.  The best part is that they are all natural...oh, and made in America!

review/text: What can I say?  Not only is this cereal yummy, it's healthy, too!  This is THE BEST dry cereal I have ever eaten, beating out all the normal, sugary ones (this one uses the cane juice as sweetener).  And, it has nothing enriched, etc., just good healthy whole grain.  I am on a diet where I cut out white flour, and I don't have to worry about that with this cereal.  I can't say enough how much I love and crave this cereal.  I haven't been able to find it, again, locally, so I think I have to buy it from amazon.  This is better than the just plain peanut butter flavor; there is something extra special about the peanut butter and chocolate together.  YUM!  YUM!  In a regular health food store or isle this would cost at least $3.99, so the price here is comparable to that.  I got it at the local bargain market, and no other cereal compares to it in my mind.  I am so going to be ordering some from you guys soon.

review/summary: Good cat food for a decent price
review/text: Soulistic cat foods are made by the same company that makes Weruva and BFF, but it is made specifically for Petco.  My son recommended these brands as a better grade of food with a little better price than some of the higher end foods (he was a local pet store manager and learned about all kinds of pet foods). So far we have only tried the "gelee" flavors, not the "gravy" ones.  They are all tuna or chicken based, with other fish products mixed in among the ingredients.  They are grain-free, no soy, gluten or nasty additives.  So far I have not had any complaints from the crew here (6 ranging from 4 months to 11 years).  Next order we may try the "gravy' flavors.

WOW did they gobble up this can of food. One of the kittens Rex is skinnier than his brother and I had been worried until I saw how excited he was for this food, he even pushed his brother out of the way to get some!<br /><br />SO if you are worried about if your cat will eat this food, please don't be...

review/summary: My Picky Cat LOVES this food!
review/text: I was advised to try this food by a worker at Petco when I was having difficulty finding wet cat food that my cat would like. His wet food 3oz per day would sit in his dish for hours with him only touching a little bit of it. It was a total waste of money for me.<br /><br />At first I was questioning the quality of the food because it was set in between the cheaper low supermarket brand cat foods instead of it being placed near the higher quality foods like Wellness, Natural Balanace, Blue Buffalo etc. The worker said.... "just try one 3oz can and see if your cat likes it." I looked at the ingredients and it looked like a pretty good food list. I asked her if it was made by Petco and she said "no."  I asked her if she knew who made it and she was not sure.  I am glad the other reviewer posted that it is made by the same company who manufactures<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> which has excellent reviews on Amazon. Finding this out makes me feel so much better about giving this food to my cat.  I give my cat a dry combo of Nature's Variety Rabbit Food with Blue Buffalo adult so I know he is getting great dry food in his system so I wasn't too worried about the wet not being up to the level of the dry as long as the food wasn't full of crappy stuff.<br /><br />Well I gave him him the Shrimp flavored one first the other day and he literally ate it in 3 or 4 minutes without stopping to take a break. I then went back to Petco to buy some more Shrimp and figured I should just try all of the flavors. Well, there wasn't much to choose from but I did buy as many flavors as was available. Apparently cat owners are getting told about this wonderful food and the stores are running low on it. I picked up the Chicken & Pumpkin(gone in 3 minutes again yesterday) as well as the Tuna in Gravy ( ate it this morning in less than no time) so I am really glad the Petco worker suggested this food to me. I am certain that my male Ragdoll will love the rest of the flavors too given how much he has loved 3 of them so far.<br /><br />The foods come either in a gelee or a gravy. My cat loves both forms of the wet cat food. The three cans I have opened so far two of them, the chicken and the tuna were both in a shaved meat form while the crab was not in a shaved form but I could see the pieces of crab in the food.  I couldn't not believe that I saw actually crab meat in this food!  I hate to tell more cat owners about this food in fear that the shelves will be completely empty when I need cat food but I just couldn't help spreading the good news about this new food I found.<br /><br />I would not hesitate trying this food. It seems to be a winner in my house!!

I can only thank G-d that there is no one with a peanut allergy in my household. The lack of disclosure about the nuts in the product description has deadly potential. Shame on Koppers.

What it doesn't say is that the product CONTAINS tree nuts, jelly beans and who knows what else.  And this is a Kosher product! Likewise the manufacturer site does not mention the additional contents of this product.  Add to that, the nuts tasted somewhere between stale and fowl.<br /><br />I certainly will not purchase another product from Koppers unless I can taste it first.<br /><br />I called customer service, got a refund and threw the remaining 4.5 pounds in the trash.

review/summary: Delicious, creamy
review/text: Apparently this is made from organic sesame seeds, nothing else added. It is smooth, not too runny at all, and sweet-tasting - which is to say, not bitter. Actually there is just the merest hint of bitter, just enough to remind you that you are, after all, tasting sesame. "Butter, not bitter". Ha.<br /><br />I proceeded to make a great batch of hummus using this. It lends just the right elusive note; a top-notch tahini is the only way to achieve that. A 16-ounce jar really isn't too much though it should be kept refrigerated as anything with high oil content and no preservatives is in danger of becoming rancid, especially in higher temperatures. Somehow the level of tahini in the jar is already lower than one batch of hummus should render it. Could it be that I am taste-testing it rather frequently? If you want to know, it does have a peanut butter consistency but of course a sesame taste.<br /><br />And finally, if you're worried about Amazon shipping a glass jar, you should know that some conscientious employee completely encased mine in bubble wrap, which was secured with tape. And there was packing material in the box. So barring a train wreck, this stood a great chance of getting to its destination intact. Which it did.

I had previously bought Al Wadi Tahina and Joyva Sesame Tahini, but compared to Kevala Organic Tahini, this one tastes so much better. Could be the glass jar that the tahini comes in or maybe because it's organic?

review/summary: A good way to start experimenting
review/text: This is very good tahina deserving of a five-star rating. I bought it as an experiment to make sure that I could still prepare proper hummus myself. I had grown very tired of the commercial brands sold in the US, which are geared towards an American palate and are on the bland side for me (I lived in the Middle East for 15 years). Because the unit price of the Al Wadi brand is so much less, however, I expect to be buying that in the future.<br /><br />This tahina is good for up to two quarts of hummus or baba ganoug, depending on your recipe and tastes. It seems to settle, so you may need to stir it before usng to get the proper consistency. You can also mix it with pekmez for a dip, or you can fake this with grape jam (which is cheaper). Baba ganoug is the same thing as hummus but using eggplant instead of garbanzos. You can also use fava beans.<br /><br />Please keep in mind that this is people's food, not haute cuisine. It doesn't have to be served on a silver platter with pita bread (which is "esh baladi" or people's bread). I'm cheap. My apartment building distributes free day-old Panera bread, so I slice up baguettes and use that instead to dip into the hummus.<br /><br />And the proper Arabic is "tahina", not "tahini" (at least in the Egyptian, Najd, and Hijaz dialects). If you say "tahini" in Cairo, people will stare at you strangely and tag you as a tourist. Don't get tagged as a tourist.

This was fresh-tasting, clean and when I make hummus, it tastes fantastic.<br /><br />You can make hummus not only with chickpeas but also with zucchini substituting for the legumes. I got the recipe from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570671753">Raw Food Made Easy</a> and because the zucchini is lighter in flavor, a good tahini is a must for this recipe. I actually prefer the zucchini variety as it's easier for me to digest and it's not so calorie-dense. Either way you make it, this is great tahini. Sesame seeds are rich in not only good oils but also in calcium, so they are a healthful addition to the diet.

review/summary: delicious tahini
review/text: This organic tahini tastes delicious. I love it and have already ordered it twice from Amazon.<br /><br />You must stir it thoroughly before taking any from the jar. (I wonder if that's why there were several negative reviews about the consistency being thin.) Once stirred completely, the consistency is nice and smooth. Of note, you should expect a thinner butter, as sesame butter is ALWAYS thinner than most other nut butters, including peanut, almond, and sunflower seed butters. I like the thinner consistency of sesame butter because it is much easier to incorporate by hand into dishes than other butters. It is also easier to measure with a tablespoon (because it is more pourable) when taking a single or half serving, which keeps me on track with my calorie counts.<br /><br />This item is currently shipped from Amazon. When I received it, at least when ordering two jars at a time, each jar was individually boxed. I didn't have to worry about breakage the next time that I ordered two more, and they were packaged the same way.

review/summary: Great Tahini!
review/text: This product gets high reviews from our household for many reasons: The flavor and texture are both smooth. It blends very well into other foods and is a lovely substitute for peanut butter on toast for the kids (goes with honey). The fact that it is in a glass jar over a metal can is a big plus. I also believe the quantity is greater than its similarly priced canned competitors. The price for this product on amazon was WAY cheaper than that in the 'natural' food store. In addition to ordering it for our household, I have also ordered this product (from Amazon) and sent it to my mother who lives in rural kentucky and can't seem to find Tahini anywhere. She likes it too.

review/text: I made homemade hummus for the first time with this.  Turned out pretty good - my husband loved it.  The tahini was easy to shake and measure.  Tasted good by itself, but I've never had stand alone tahini before.  I would say I would buy it again, but I don't know if I will finish this jar before the expiration date - hummus only takes a few tablespoons and this is a large jar.  Still, I'm happy.

review/text: The taste Kevala tahini good. It's very, very soupy. There is a statement on the label that says it's "made in USA" but it is placed a position that makes it unclear whether the tahini is made in the US or the jar is made in the US.<br /><br />My personal preference is Organic Raw Tahini made by the Living Tree Community which I rate as a '5.' The taste is better in my opinion and I specially like the texture. On their web site they explain how their tahini is made. (Note: I find it slightly less expensive if I buy several bottles directly from them and pay the shipping than buy through amazon.)

review/summary: A big melted mess
review/text: This order arrived in a timely fashion and was well packed, but when I opened the box, I found all the gummi bears had melted together in one big lump within the 12 individual packages. I didn't think gummi bears would melt, but believe me, they will. Each bag contained one big colorful mass of gummis. My grandchildren ate the gummis anyway, after I took a knife and chopped the lumps into smaller pieces. The candies were harder and tougher than other gummis, but I could not tell you if that is normal or a result of the melting. As to taste, who can say when you are eating a combination of flavors in every bite. I do live in Texas and the weather is hot, but not unreasonable this time of year. I will not be ordering anymore perishables from Amazon, ever.

Surprise, surprise--after a few minutes of looking at me with the "where is the good stuff" look, they ate it.

review/summary: Good recommendation via "Extra Virginity"
review/text: A week or so ago, I heard an interview on NPR's "Splendid Table" program with Tom Mueller, author of "Extra Virginity" that convincingly suggested that "Castillo de Canena" Spanish olive oil was one of the few brands of the product that could be trusted to be high quality, authentic extra virgin olive oil.  While I almost choked at the very high price asked by distributor La Tienda, I ordered a bottle.  The oil arrived within a couple of days, heavily pillowed in bubble wrap, and we gave it a try immediately.<br /><br />I have to say that Castillo de Canena is pretty much everything that Mueller promised.  The taste is very fine; fresh, herbal and peppery.  It does provide the throat burn that confirms its therapeutic benefits.  And it does add a boost to anything it's added to, including salads, soup or just bread.  The problem, of course, is getting hooked on such quality at such an upscale price.  So while I will be a fan of Castillo de Canena for the indefinite future, I will probably check out Tom Mueller's other recommended sources for extra virgin olive oil in hopes of finding something as good, but a little less pricey.  The California labels might be a place to start.<br /><br />Meanwhile, this one is highly recommended.

review/summary: Satisfies Miss Finicky!
review/text: Of our 3 cats, our middle one is by far the most finicky!  On top of that she has allergies to poultry so it has been a nightmare trying to make her happy at mealtimes.  It is so frustrating when you put food down for her and have her sniff it and walk away.  NO fun at all.  I can usually get her to try new things by either heating it up for just a few seconds or adding a little more water to it to make a broth surrounding the main dish.  She has been on Addiction rabbit along with Nature's Logic rabbit and Nature's Variety rabbit, but lately she will only eat the Nature's Variety.  My concern was that some morning she would turn her nose up to that and I would be sunk. I wanted to expand her tastes but didn't know what to choose because she has already turned away from venison, brushtail and duck.  I was a little concerned with this flavor for 2 reasons...1, I have never given my cats beef and 2, because it has eggs in it and I wasn't sure if that would be a problem with her allergy to poultry.  I gave her Petguard beef and barley and By Nature 95% beef which she actually ate.  Sometimes after a little coaxing, but she did eat them.  I figured I may as well go all out and give this a try as well.  I served my cats their breakfast and was ready with a can of rabbit food just in case, but to my delight, she dove in and didn't stop until it was gone eating the whole 3oz can!  The rabbit from this brand is the only other food she has ever done that with. I just came on and ordered more.  Finally she loves something and because of that, so do we.  Another huge plus is that because the instinct foods, cat and dog, are identical, I can use these little cans to feed my little shihtzu too.  He loves the chicken, duck and beef.  Whole Healthy Pet has a great deal on the venison so I got him some of that too and will give him that tomorrow.  Sheldon isn't near as picky so I think it is sure to be a hit with him.<br /><br />UPDATE: 4-4-2012  Mabel, Miss Finicky,  is still diving into this food but has turned her nose up to the Petguard beef & barley as well as By nature beef.  Will definitely keep this one on hand.  She is still eating the rabbit variety as well.

review/text: I don't know how ANYONE could rate this so-called "cat" food above a 1 star - it is CRUD.<br /><br />The food is cheap - stuffed full of fillers. My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk. It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well, it's not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick - one of the major ingredients in ALL their "flavors" is Montmorillonite CLAY (yes, the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud!) - ie, very similar to what cat litter is made from...<br /><br />To show how bad it is, even the raccoons and coyotes won't eat this junk - they'd rather eat carrion...<br /><br />Those that think this is "good" food, I can't imagine the crud you've been feeding your cats before - shame on you! Shame on anyone buying this crud - go buy a selection of Fancy Feast (Classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats - and it's excellent quality food - puts this junk to shame) and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk.<br /><br />I wish I could give this crud negative stars - it shouldn't be allowed to be sold.

review/summary: Jasmine Pearl Tea
review/text: I keep jasmine pearl tea on hand because my family loves it. The smell is heavenly and jasmine pearl tea doesn't develop the strong bitter aftertaste the longer it sets out. Maybe this is a quality of the green teas in general.  The tea leaves have a very pleasant mild taste. I strongly recommend this tea to any tea lover.

review/summary: Favorite Green Tea
review/text: This is my favorite green tea to share with friends.  The aroma when adding the hot water and while the ta is brewing is delightful, and just a prelude to the wonderful flavor of this tea.  Not to mention the health benefits of a cup of green tea to start the day!  I love watching the pearls unfurl in my brewer.  There is no bitter aftertaste -- and I can get two brewings from the same pearls.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: If one was to be assaulted by a jasmine plant, it would smell just like the floral aroma that filled the room when I greedily pried the lid off of my tin of tea. The scent is overwhelming. The pearls are smaller than other brands I've seen, but they unfurl beautifully and can be re-steeped. As far as flavor, it's light on the tongue but heavily perfumed. I prefer many fast steepings as opposed to just one or two longer ones, so your mileage may vary.<br /><br />If you brew this, I recommend letting the kettle cool a little first. Don't pour boiling water on the leaves, let it rest a minute. Green is more delicate. I kept my leaves in the water a minute for the first steeping, a minute for the second, ninety seconds for the third, and two minutes for the fourth. Filtered water tastes better than tap.

review/summary: Very good quality Jasmine tea balls.
review/text: I've had quite a few different jasmine tea pearls and they come in a variety of grades.  These superior grade specimens from Summit are just that.  They average around 8mm-1cm in diameter (large) and have an extremely pungent and fresh jasmine aroma.  In the cup they unfurl into whole young spring needle leaves.  The liquor is an inviting pale yellowish green with moderate to strong tannin and a rich flavor strongly redolent of jasmine blossoms.<br /><br />I drink this kind of tea in a tall cup.  I put 6-10 pearls in the bottom and let the leaves unfurl there (i.e. I do not use an infuser and I do not remove the leaves while I drink the tea).  Unlike most green teas this doesn't get too bitter with an extended time in the cup.  In this way it is like a green wulong.  Because of the strong flavor, this tea can be infused multiple times.<br /><br />The quality of jasmine tea pearls varies.  Some are small and hard.  Some are infused with only jasmine oil and some include blossoms.  This example is among the better ones obtainable in terms of size and grade of the leaves and the quality of the floral scent.  Recommended.

review/text: This my first experience with green tea and I have to say that I have thoroughly enjoyed it. The tea has a wonderful jasmine fragrance to it and a very subtle taste. I also love the whole experience of preparing the tea. The company shipped the tea in a nice air-tight container, and although the shipping was not the quickest, it was not unreasonable either.

review/summary: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PECTIN!
review/text: My daughter and I recently made jam and we LOVED this pectin. I hadn't made jam in over ten years, so I was thrilled to find a new pectin that you didn't have to use sugar or very little sugar. Plus, we loved that you could use other sweeteners like honey or agave nectar and still have the jam set up perfectly. Another great bonus was that we only had to use one box of pectin for 24 jars of jam. Very easy to use product and we will be jammin' again soon!

review/text: I have used this for years for making jams. I have always disliked the overly sweet jams sold in supermarkets, and I don't like the sugar-free variety either-the flavor is artifical. Pomona's gives me the choice of how much sugar I want to use...if so desired, I can use it with no sugar whatsoever! Wonderful product. I would recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: Works great, and a good value too
review/text: I'm not a real homemaker, but I play one in my kitchen.<br /><br />I've helped the Mrs. can things in the past, but my involvement was pitting, coring, and dumping out really big pots of boiling water. My wife canned the way that worked for her, packets of SureJell and lots and lots of sugar. We have been progressively reducing our families sugar consumption. As summer rolled in and fresh strawberries ripened, I sallied forth and picked 75# of them. (Yes, I know. Nobody needs that much jam. I dried a bunch). I had read that Pomona's worked with low-sugar recipes so I bought some.<br /><br />In the middle of my first batch of strawberry jam, my wife observed the small amount of sugar I was using and told me flat out that my jam wasn't going to set. She had tried SureJell's "Low or No Sugar" with poor results. She hadn't noticed my box of Pomona's. I thanked her for her opinion, and continued on my merry way.<br /><br />After my first two batches set perfectly, she paid more attention and discovered my secret. Pomona's. I have since made low sugar versions of raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry jams and all have set perfectly. I could scarcely be more pleased.<br /><br />Next to being being able to get a good set with low sugar recipes, my favorite feature of Pomona's is that I can make HUGE batches. Instead of working in small batches, as some other unnamed pectin requires, I was able to make an enormous batch of jam with 3 boxes worth of Pomona's. Again, I was advised it would not work, but every single jar came out perfectly. Pomona's has a special place in my pantry.<br /><br />Once I knew to look for Pomona's, I have seen it in most grocery stores. It tends to cost more than SureJell but since the yield is higher per box, it's actually a better value. And the best value is in the 6 pack right here on Amazon.

review/summary: Pamonas Pectin
review/text: I have tried all the other pectin products available in My local stores with virtually no success. The jam always came out more like syrup tasty but runny. I read about Pamonas and decided to give it a try. I don't like to use a lot of sugar and all other pectins require that You use 55% -85% sugar in order for the pectin to do its job. Pamonas Pectin allows You to sweeten Your jam to Your own taste You can even make jam with No Sugar. I made raspberry Jam using 20 cups of berries 4 cups of sugar and one package of Pamonas Pectin. The jam set up perfectly after 3 seasons of canning I finally found the secret "Pamonas"

review/summary: Grrrreat Pectin
review/text: I am a heart patient with Type 2 Diabetes intent on living forever and keeping all my extremities.  I attempt to eat a diet that is both salt and sugar free.  I have prepared my homemade jellies and jams for at least thirty years.  After being diagnosed with diabetes I initially gave up my homemade for tasteless 'sugar free' diabetic jellies and jams from the supermarket.  The jellies I created with Gelatin reminded me of the WWII surplus 'Jello' fed in Army mess-halls in the 1950's.<br />It took me but two tries to get it right with Pomona's Universal Pectin.  I like my jellies a bit tart with very strong flavor.<br />My recipe for "Pomegranate & Cranberry" jelly is:<br />1-  12 ounce can of frozen Old Orchard Pomegranate Cranberry Juice.<br />2-  24 ounces of water.<br />3-  1/3 cup of Real Lemon.<br />4-  1 1/2 cup of granulated Splenda.<br />5-  5 tsp. calcium water.<br />6-  5 tsp. Pomona's Universal Pectin Powder.<br />7-  1 tsp. butter or margarine.<br /><br />Prepare calcium water per package instructions.<br />Prepare three pint jars per package instructions.<br />Dilute one 12 ounce can of frozen Old Orchard Pomegranate Cranberry with 24 ounces of water.<br />Add 1/3 cup of real lemon to the base.<br />Begin heating the prepared juice base, real lemon and calcium water in a 4 quart Teflon sauce pan.<br />Use a hand blender like the Toastmaster 1740 2-Speed Hand Blender to stir the liquid.<br />Add the Splenda, margarine and Pectin powder to the mixture while continuing to blend.<br />Bring the mixture to a rolling boil for one minute.<br />Remove the pan from the heat, skim off any foam with a metal spoon and pour the liquid into the prepared jars.<br /><br />Works for me, and my wife says, "It tastes like real jelly".

review/summary: Stop the Insanity!
review/text: Boy, this is the way to use pectin!  If you're like me, and are a canner of jams and jellies, you dislike the obscene amounts of sugar required when you use regular pectins - it's just nuts.  You may also object to the high price of the stuff, and the fact that you can't use less (or more!) pectin than the recipe calls for - and then your efforts may -or may not- be successful - regular pectin is touchy stuff!<br /><br />Well, if you are annoyed by the same pectin issues as I, this stuff is the answer.  Make as little or as much jam or jelly as you wish - and never worry about whether it will work or not - this is stable stuff - use the right amount, and your results will always be the same.  Really, this stuff will change the way you do canning!<br /><br />If you buy it in bulk, the cost will be much less than regular pectin - and it has a long shelf life too.  I don't know why I waited so long to try it.

review/summary: Superior to conventional pectin and AMAZING service
review/text: I tell every canner I know about this stuff!  I don't know how long it's been around, but if more people knew about it, SureJell, Ball, and other makers of conventional pectin would be out of business.  No more worrying about having to add a ton of sugar to recipes that are already plenty sweet just to get the pectin to set!  And, although it may seem that Pomona's is pricier, it's actually CHEAPER because one box of Pomona's will do multiple batches.<br /><br />So awesome product, but even more amazing is their incredible customer service: I had made a large batch of pepper jelly that didn't set with conventional pectin (shame on me for septupling the recipe!), so I called up Pomona's "Jam Line" and was amazed at the expertise and care of the woman who helped me--she coached me on exactly how to fix my mistake and turn my syrup into the jam it was intended to be.

review/summary: Great low-or-no-sweetener pectin
review/text: I love this pectin. It allows me to make low sugar jams reliably without having to cook the fruit down to a paste. My jams turn out great every time with a fruity, bright taste, a pleasant texture and a lovely color. And the best part is that it tastes like FRUIT instead of tasting ridiculously oversweet.<br /><br />One thing to note, though, is that low-sugar jam will always have a slightly different texture than the sugary stuff, regardless of whether you use this pectin or other types of low-sugar pectin. I describe it as less of the sticky quality that sugar gives. I notice it, but people who get me jam don't seem to notice or care.<br /><br />I just found a canning book on Amazon that uses Pomona's for all of it's jams: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603425462">Put 'em Up!: A Comprehensive Home Preserving Guide for the Creative Cook, from Drying and Freezing to Canning and Pickling</a>. I have not read it yet, but I think it'll be worth a look.

review/summary: Foolproof jams at a lower price
review/text: Pomona's Pectin has really been foolproof for me in making jam, jelly, and marmalade.  It works with significantly reduced sugar, unlike most pectin that needs a lot of sugar to activate it.  The best part? It's usually about $5 or $6 a box at my local health food store, so this is an amazing value.

review/summary: the taste of fruit shines through
review/text: Pomona's universal pectin is amazing. I use this pectin exclusively since the flavor of the fruit shines through with out massive amounts of sugar. This years strawberry jam batch has to be rationed! As the wife of a diabetic and sugar sensitive child I am thrilled that the low sugar or no sugar recipes are gobbled up! My daughter finally started eating PB and J sandwiches when the jam is made with Pomona's low sugar recipes. Prior to that it was PB only. You'll never want to buy store bought jam again. When I give jam is a gift I always get questions of how can low sugar jam taste so good. Pomona's is why!
