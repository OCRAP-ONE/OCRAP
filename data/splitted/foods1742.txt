review/summary: Scrumptious little suckers but overpriced
review/text: I got them at Wall-Mart for $1.83 a box. With subscribe & save would have cost me $2.38. Now, don't get me wrong, I love S&S, I signed up for a lot of things, but buyer beware, price is not as competitive as we're accostumed with S&S.

review/summary: Son loves these!
review/text: I wasn't sure how sweet potato flavored puffs would go over, but my son loves these. I started giving these to him around age 6 months, and the star shape seemed to be pretty easy for him to pick up. He also loves the banana and apple cinnamon flavors, too.

review/summary: Good for a Teething Baby.
review/text: Our 11-month-old boy is teething and starting on solid foods. We've been giving him more and more solids for a number of months now. You'd be amazed at the things he loves to eat, such as french fries for example. In any case, my wife found Gerber's Graduates in a variety of forms and the boy seems to like them all to one degree or another.<br /><br />One of the varieties our boy likes is the Graduates puffs. They come in several flavors and the present ones we have are the apple-cinnamon. Previously we had some banana-flavored ones. In any case, the  specific flavor seems to make little difference. The little puffs are about 3/8 inch across and are star shaped. We give them to the boy one at a time, which gets somewhat tiresome. So, we place a small handful on his high-chair tray now and then. He attempts to get them all in his hand and then put them all in his mouth at the same time. What are you gonna do? He seems to like chewing them up, as best as he can, and we've had no problems with him choking or anything like that. It's a good product, but we, and the boy, prefer the Cheeto-like larger crunchies.<br /><br />Gary Peterson.

review/summary: I'm 21, but I eat them for myself. They're delicious!!
review/text: I'm 21, but these are great snacks even for adults! I first tried them when my nephew was a toddler. My sister got him these all the time because he loved them. She told me "Try one for yourself. They're really good" so I did. They melt in your mouth within seconds, so this is great for toddlers and babies who can't chew very well yet. As for myself, I'm a constant snacker, so these are a great alternative for me so I don't gain weight. They have vitamin E, Zinc, Iron, and Calcium in them. This is great nutrition for your toddler or baby ... and myself as well I suppose haha.<br /><br />So far I have only tried Strawberry apple and banana. They truly do taste like their flavors they say they are. This is another reason it is a great snack for your little ones. It'll help cause a much easier transition from these to the real thing (real strawberries, apples, and bananas I mean).<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. It's great =)

review/summary: good, but there are alternatives
review/text: PROS<br />-great to start as finger foods (easier than cheerios to pick up and eat)<br />-dissolves quickly (less of a choking hazard)<br />-baby loves them!<br /><br />CONS<br />-stains!  As the baby drools on his hands or loses a half-eaten puff, it leaves a bright orange stain on clothing, rugs, etc.  Not easy to get out, and a lot of the other flavors are more neutral colored and do not stain as much as the sweet potato.  The last thing I want to do is have to wash his highchair cover and straps, rugs, clothes, etc because of bright orange stains all around.<br />-cheaper versions available (ie, at Target they have their own brands)<br />-does have sugar (I wish they can make a low or non-sugar version, because I'm pretty sure the baby will still eat them.  Why add unnecessary sugar into everything?)<br /><br />I started with the Gerber sweet potato, but I'll be sticking to the Target blueberry (because it's cheaper and doesn't stain)

review/summary: One of my son's favorites
review/text: These puffs are great for a snack for my toddler. He loves all the flavors of these, but banana most of all. My husband and I even tried one ourselves to see what they were like. In my opinion, the banana aroma is much stronger than the flavoring. It's not a bad thing, there's just a very strong aroma of bananas when you open the container, so if I hadn't tried these myself, I would assume my son is getting a flavor (sugar) overload. That is NOT the case. There is just enough flavoring to make these good. My husband (who HATES fruit of any kind and refuses to eat it) actually said these weren't bad. Coming from him, that's a huge compliment.

It saves me from running to the store to get them every week. They are also cheaper from Amazon with this program. The sweet potato flavor is sweet, but not too sweet. We've also tried the banana which has a "real" taste to it, rather than an artificial one.

review/text: My baby (13 months) loves this flavor of Gerber Puffs. The flavor is mild and the texture is really easy for her to chew now. I've actually been giving my baby Puffs since she was about 5 months old and had no teeth. We've tried and approved of Strawberry+Apple, Banana, Sweet Potato and of course this one. We also tried and dislike Apple cinnamon (too sweet) and Cherry (too tart).

review/text: These little snacks are wonderful for little ones learning to self feed. They almost instantly melt in your mouth and I feel that under supervision pose very little choking risk. I had tried many things before these, from Cheerios to Nilla Wafers (crushed up) and nothing was even worth comparing to these puffs.  The sweet potato flavor is also very tasty, and my little one eats them up as fast as I let her!

review/summary: Taste great, not messy
review/text: My daughter officially gives these 5 stars - she just loves them.  These were her first finger food, and they remain her favorite.  I'll add my own 5 stars because they're an easy, convenient snack, and unlike Cheerios, they don't make a mess when the child is just learning to eat (the Cheerios were dribbling out of her mouth and onto her clothes); I suspect it's because the fruit puffs dissolve more quickly.  I'm not crazy about the price - 1.48 oz. isn't exactly a huge amount - but on the other hand, I don't give her that many, so a canister lasts a few weeks (vs. the recommended six servings).  Giving it in smaller quantities should also alleviate concerns about sugar in the product (sugar is the fifth ingredient in the banana puffs).

review/text: When my baby got too big to eat mashed sweet potato--and didn't have teeth to eat it otherwise--I started giving her these. She loved the taste and the texture was crunchy enough to soothe her teething gums while still being soft enough to dissolve easily in her mouth. They're also a really great finger food. I put some in her tray and she'll eat as many as she wants and drop the rest on the floor, which we pick up and put in the bird feeder. Incidentally, the birds enjoy them too :)

review/text: This is a good idea, and they dissolve quickly for babies new to food. But if a partially slobbered on one falls out of the baby's mouth and onto clothing it leaves a stain that proves impossible to remove. The puffs have a bit of an orange coating on them, it must contain food coloring. I've tried organic puffs and they don't leave any stains.

review/text: I bought these because I like the idea of a veggie flavor over a fruit flavor.  They really are delicious, but they are very sweet.  They taste a lot like a kids cereal (which they kind of are).  I prefer the Plum and Happy Baby ones because they have half the sugar, and my 11 month old doesn't mind.  If I try to mix the low sugar ones with the Gerber, she will go for the Gerber.  If you don't care about the sugar increase (it is really small), these are tasty and your child will eat them.  If you care about sugar, go with Happy Baby.

review/summary: A good choice for new crunchers and munchers!
review/text: I was pretty wild about these for awhile when my little guy started eating solid food; they dissolve easily and he has fun picking them up. If I put a bunch in his tray, he'll try to shovel them in, but if I put one at a time down he'll pick them up with a thumb and finger. He's fun to watch, learning new things.<br /><br />I do worry about the added sugar, so I've been holding back a little on these lately, offering them less often and giving him Cheerios instead. The Gerber/Nestle corn crunchies are a little up in the sodium, too. Kid snacks don't need that stuff, really, so I'm looking for alternatives, but I think these will still be around at our house for awhile; everything in moderation. :)

review/summary: perfect first finger food
review/text: We used this as a first finger food with our twins and broke them into even smaller pieces.  Our babies had lots of teeth by 8 months, so they were able to chew.  The puffs melt down when sucked on, so it's a great first "real food" for the little ones.  The sweet potato is not "too sweet" as most of the other flavors are.  Even my older kids (ages 5 and 7) like to snack on these.  I never go anywhere in the car without them.  The star shape seems to be easier for the babies to get to their own mouths when just learning to self feed.

All was well until I removed him from his high chair and saw orange spots everywhere. He is learning to self feed and drools quite a bit so I when he was grabbing at them with his wet hands some of the puffs on the tray got wet. When I went to clean off the tray the puffs came off but everywhere there was a wet puff I now have an orange stain. I wouldn't be so mad of there was some kind of warning on the jar but I can't find one. I am really glad he was shirtless or I can't imagine what his clothes would look like.

review/text: We've tried several brands to determine the best-tasting fettucine ever---and to our surprise found it made right here in the USA!!!!!  Guess it must be the American durum wheat and processing know-how of over-100 years experience.

review/text: These are just as good as other brands of K Cups. Delicious flavor and work perfectly in my Keurig B70 machine. Wish they had not raised the price though, now they are more expensive than original style K Cups. Kind of defeated my purpose as I was looking for something more economical. All in all though I am satisfied especially with the fact that they eliminated the plastic part of the cup. Makes them much more environmentally friendly.

review/summary: SAME AS DEFURR-UMS?  CLOSE ENOUGH!!!  BOTH EXCELLENT!!!
review/text: This is a reformulated DEFURR-UMS HAIRBALL TREATS (reviewed separately).  The exact ingredients for comparison are hard to come by.  M&C does not list them on its website; luckily a few retail websites have an "ingredients" button that forces M&C to disclose the major ingredients to its otherwise "proprietary" recipe.  The new  concoction made quite a few changes (adding inulin for example and ?cranberry?) but the changes have not affected acceptability negatively (possibly improved it, judging by our pickiest cat who now accepts it). The only negative change is in the pricepoint ($8 vs $4) at which the new package is offered on Amazon; Petco stores have the new package on sale for $4. Until Amazon transfers the reviews under the phased-out version over to this new (and improved?) formula, you might want to take a look at the DEFURR-UMS evaluations and also my separate review of hairball remedies under PET NATURALS HAIRBALL. The HEALTHYBITES iteration is excellent (and I will update this review if its long-term performance proves negative) but my opinion of M&C customer service stands ("lousy"); maybe they loaned the service reps to the marketing department during the change in packaging from metallic to white and the switch in names from DEFURR-UMS to HEALTHYBITES. Personally, I liked the DEFURR-UMS tag; how could you do any better for a hairball remedy than DEFURR-UMS?

review/text: I really wish Amazon would list ingredients for the food products they sell, whether it's for human or animal consumption.  For some reason I assumed Greenies were natural and it's completely my fault for not looking for the ingredients on another site before buying, but yeah... these are corn-based and thus not very different from the junk you can get in the supermarket.  Oh, except these cost more.  So why should I buy them??  Sure my cat likes them but she seems to like 95% of the treats I give her, plus simply liking them doesn't make them good/healthy for her - much like inhaling a box of Cheez-Its is deliciously naughty for me.<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients in the salmon Greenies for anyone who cares:<br /><br />Chicken Meal, Ground Brewers Rice, Ground Wheat, Corn Gluten Meal, Poultry Fat (Preserved With Mixed Tocopherols), Sprayed Dried Hydrolyzed Chicken Protein Concentrate, Oat Fiber, Salmon Meal, Natural Chicken Flavor, Vegetable Oil (Preserved With Mixed Tocopherols), Natural Poultry and Fish Flavor, Sodium Gluconate, Brewer's Dried Yeast, Calcium Carbonate, Potassium Chloride, Glucono-delta-lactone, Citric Acid, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Vitamins: [Vitamin A Supplement, D-Activated Animal Sterol (Source of Vitamin D3 Supplement), dl-Alpha Tocopherol Acetate (Source of Vitamin E), Niacin Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), Riboflavin Supplement, Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K Activity), Folic Acid, Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement], Minerals: [Zinc Proteinate; Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Iron Sulfate, Sodium Selenite, Cobalt Carbonate, Ethylenediamine Dihydriodide], Mixed Tocopherols, Rosemary Extract, DL Methionine, Chlorophyll.

review/summary: Too much corn meal!
review/text: Corn meal has no place in a cat's diet! Cats are pure carnivores.  I think corn meal plays a role in the development of tartar, in the first place. It definitely plays a role in feline obesity - rich carbs like corn fatten up cows.  I'm going to try CET treats... or something else.  Corn is a cheap commodity and popular filler because it's a SUBSIDIZED commodity.  This is also why many food manufacturers use High Fructose Corn Syrup instead of real sugar - sugar is not subsidized.  Corn meal in cat food products is great for corporate profits but BAD for our cats.

review/summary: Just ONE of these made my kitty sick!
review/text: I bought these thinking they would be a slightly more productive treat for my 6yo, small, male cat. Usually I give him little pieces of plain fish or chicken, but was happy that there was something that might lessen how often I brush his teeth (since he hates it with a furry passion!).<br /><br />I gave him one thinking if he liked it I would give him more, but didn't want to confuse his system. After about 3 minutes, he threw up everywhere. More than once. I didn't want him to be sick, but he was so excited and had gobbled it up so fast I thought I would try the other flavor. Same thing after only one greenie. He's an EXTREMELY healthy cat, very active and has never had a single health problem, but these made him so sick. After he threw up he wouldn't eat for two days. I was going to take him to the vet, but he perked back up, and started eating normally (hasn't thrown up once since).<br /><br />Obviously it's not like this for every cat, but I looked into it further and if you read reviews from other major sellers there are many problems like this in perfectly healthy cats. Some reacted even worse than mine, so I was lucky.

review/text: I was told that my male cat needed tooth work next year(2013).  I went on line and found C.E.T. but as it happens my female is the only one that likes them.  Then I found that Greenies were good for teeth and the male loves them.  Of course it was exposed that the Greenies didn't have enzymes, ammino acids, Lactase inhibitors and stem cells.  I still gave the male 6-8 Greenies a day.  Now I looked at his teeth at the start and the gums were red, now I see a pinkish color.  I give them dry food in the morning and their teeth didn't seem to change.  I have to conclude that the Greenies are doing something to make the gums better.

The pet store had Eukanuba and, out of the corner of my eye, I saw "for German Shepherds" and decided to try it even if it is a bit expensive.<br /><br />It was the best pet food decision I've ever made.<br /><br />He's bulked out now to a normal weight, has a coat that's incredible, and his breath is clean and sweet. It's great on his digestion--he doesn't eat grass anymore and has healthy poops everyday. Sure it might be pricey, but isn't your loyal companion and protector worth it?

review/summary: Love these bottles
review/text: I keep switching back and forth between this and the organic ketchup at Trader Joe's. I keep coming back to these ones because they're easier for me to hold and squeeze, even with arthritis in my hands, and easier for my preschool daughter to use (unlike longer necked ones that she tends to have less control of, squirting ketchup everywhere!).<br /><br />As far as the ketchup itself goes, it's ketchup. I'm guessing you've had it before. (If not, go to a fast food pace to get a packet to try it out. It's the same stuff.)

review/summary: my nightmare is finally over
review/text: Most of my childhood was spent in want of quality catsup served in an easy to pour device.  As hard as I have tried to forget, so many tormented images still seem to surface from time to time.  Like the time that I found my Memaw dead on the kitchen floor clutching a clogged bottle of Kirk's economy catsup.  I don't care what the police say with their whole "Gampy stabbed Memaw" theory.  Fact is cheap catsup played a role in this horrible event, an event that could have easily been avoided. If only Memaw had access to Heinz Tomato Ketchup, 20-Ounce Easy Squeeze Bottles.<br />And it's not just the death of my dear Memaw.  The ugly head of sub quality catsup reared its head again during what should have been those wonderful early teen years everyone talks about.  It was early summer and Gampy had just been released early from the Warren County correctional Facility for good behavior.  We were all gathered for a summer picnic/ Gampys out of prison celebration. Well everyone except for Memaw, although she was there in spirit.  All was going along swimmingly until my Pops delivered a plate of beautifully grilled hotdogs and burgers to the table.  As a gesture of "welcome home Gampy", I leaned forward and grabbed the cumbersome glass bottle of Cheap Conny's country catsup and proceeded to apply it to Gampy's dog.  When I awoke in the hospital 3 weeks later, I was brought up to speed on the series of events that followed my attempt to use a lesser quality catsup.  Events that my brain surgeon informed me I may never recover.  To quickly summarize, years of cheap homemade prison toilet catsup had left a brutal impression on Gampy.  When my hair is cut very short you can still see this impression on the back of my skull.<br />It was not until I hit my late 20's that an event finally sent me over the edge and I had the epiphany concerning crappy catsup and its dire effects on the human condition.  As a handsome young 27 year old buck, you can imagine I had my pick of the ladies.  And did I ever pick a good one.  Roberta was as pretty as she was smart. And boy was she smart.  She was finishing her PHD in Physics, Captain of her schools debate team and a champion chess player in Warren County.  Seems like there wasn't anything Roberta did wrong.  Well, with the exception of her constant purchasing of mid grade catsup dispensed through inefficient containers.  It was just a mere 5 years prior to the release of Heinz Tomato Ketchup, 20-Ounce Easy Squeeze Bottles.  A fact that just haunts me.  Due to severe heart problems, Gampy had been released once again from the Warren County Correctional Facility.  He was living with me temporarily while Pops try to find a home for him.  I was working late and Roberta had called me and let me know that she was making dinner for her a Gampy and that she would try and save some French fries for me.  DAMN THOSE FRENCH FRIES AND THEIR DEPENDECE UPON TASTEY CATSUP SERVED CONVIENTLY!<br />The squad cars were in the driveway when I got home that night.  We will never really be sure what happened that night.  What we do know is that Gampy and Roberta are in a better place now.  A heavenly place that is not burdened by watered down catsup that tastes like chemical tomatoes.<br />I swore that night that I would never consume catsup again.  And then one day I stumbled across Heinz Tomato Ketchup, 20-Ounce Easy Squeeze Bottles.  It was pure heaven served easily through a squeeze bottle.  Since using Heinz Tomato Ketchup, 20-Ounce Easy Squeeze Bottles, my life has been for the better.  My only regret is that my dear Gamby had to pass so soon and miss this wonderful product.

review/summary: High Fructose Corn Syrup
review/text: High fructose corn syrup costs a few cents less per gallon than real sugar, so that's the sweetener they use here. The good news is they offer "Simply Heinz," which is made with real sugar. The taste is noticeably better and while the corn lobby wants you to believe otherwise, my bet is that the real sugar is healthier.  For a condiment that lasts for months, do yourself a favor and spend the extra few cents to get the good stuff.

review/summary: Not Nutella and I'm so glad it's not!
review/text: This is so delicious! Amazon didnt have the Chocolate Hazelnut available with their subscribe and save program, that I typically order, so I decided to give the Almond a try and am so glad I did. This is made from Almonds so of course has a different taste than the Hazelnut Chocolate Butter (also made by Justins) but it is still just as good. When u read the ingredients (which you should) you will notice that the #1 ingredient is actually Almonds. This is an excellent source of protein and good fat and a great 'treat'. This should not be compared to Nutella, of course your taste buds would chose something with more sugar, but sometimes you need to have some self control and make a choice that's better for your health and your families health. I admit I have had Nutella and it was tasty, but after looking at the ingredients I will never buy it again. How can anyone make the choice to purchase and consume something with the top 2 ingredients being Sugar and Oil? I cant believe that people give it to their kids and think it's healthy.

review/summary: Not Nutella but not bad either
review/text: I was looking for something a tad healthier to replace my infatuation with Nutella when I came across this chocolate almond butter.  I took the plunge and ordered it from Amazon, though it would have been an easier plunge if I did not have to order three jars of an unknown-to-me product at one time.  Since my goal was to replace it for Nutella I will say that it is not quite as sweet, nor as smooth nor as melt-in-your-mouth candy bar-ish as Nutella and it doesn't quite spread onto toast as easily and the total calories per serving are within 10 of each other.  Neither product has trans fats, the almond butter a bit higher in total fat but has many less total carbs and has a higher fiber content.  I think the chocolate in the almond butter is of good quality and my brain tells me it is a healthier choice because I don't tend to want to eat it straight out of the jar on a spoon like Nutella so I am automatically saving calories, right?  My taste buds tend to agree that Justin's starts out with good ingredients and to make a long story short I would buy this again (once we finish the three jars.)

review/summary: Kids love it MORE than Nutella
review/text: We've been through a couple jars of nutella and my 6 kids MUCH prefer Justin's over the Nutella.  Justin's tastes more like real chocolate--yes it's a slightly different texture but far more tastier.  Checked the label of Nutella and 19 grams of sugar per 2 tablespoons is ridiculous--that's literally as much sugar as 2 tablespoons of canned cake frosting.  Justin's has 7 grams for same serving size.  19 grams of sugar is almost 5 teaspoons of sugar in every serving--it only leaves a little more than a teasoon to try to fit in hazelnut butter, cocoa, oil, etc.  Sorry, but Nutella is literally almost all sugar.  Justin's tastes really really chocolately and good.

review/text: I never expected the heavenly taste when I dipped in for a spoonful.  Very fresh tasting, not rancid at all. Just the perfect amount of sweetness without wanting more and without the tongue curl that happens with fudge.  The texture has some minute particles, but this only adds to the overall good experience.<br /><br />Only 11 carbs and all organic ingredients.  It is an unexpected treat item that anyone would enjoy, even those with well-known sweet toothe issues. It would probably be good on toast but I won't waste it on mundane breakfast food.  It will be a precious dessert item for our household.

I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a healthy alternative to nutella. It doesn't have the candy taste that nutella has, but I think it's just as good, sometimes eating nutella for breakfast felt like eating dessert for breakfast, a little too sweet, this is perfect.

review/summary: Best nut butter around!
review/text: No, this is NOT Nutella. Nutella is made with hazelnuts, so almond butter will taste different. This also has 7 gr of sugar to Nutella's 20 gr (per 2 Tbsp), so it definately isn't as ooey-gooey sweet as Nutella. But if you want the best chocolate nut butter around, this is it.<br /><br />I've tried all of Justin's nut butters - peanut, hazelnut, etc - and I definately like chocolate almond the best. But I like regular almond butter more than peanut butter anyway.<br /><br />As a former Nutella addict, this doesn't have the smooth, creamy consistency of Nutella. It is more coarsely ground nuts. If you want smooth & creamy, you might want to try I.M Healthy's chocolate soy nut butter. I like that a lot too and it's got the smooth consistency that some demand.<br /><br />But this one is the best! Great almond taste and rich chocolate taste!

review/text: Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NIND">Bon App&eacute;tit</a> magazine, predicts sriracha will be one of the biggest food trends of 2010!<br /><br />Knowlton was a guest on the CBS Early Show and shared, "If you walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha. Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on."<br /><br />Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it is on a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hamburger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.<br /><br />Last year, New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed "Thai ketchup." Here's an excerpt:<br /><br />[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]<br /><br />Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.<br /><br />Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.<br /><br />Sriracha Remoulade<br /><br />1 cup mayonnaise<br />1/4 cup sriracha<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br /><br />Whisk together until smooth. Serve as a dipping sauce with fried calamari rings.<br /><br />Fried Calamari<br /><br />1/2 cup calamari<br />1 cup milk<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup semolina<br />Vegetable oil for frying<br />Salt and pepper<br /><br />Soak calamari rings in milk for about 20 minutes; drain.<br /><br />In a bowl, combine the flour and semolina. Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture, and shake off the excess. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the calamari until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper and serve with Sriracha Remoulade.<br /><br />Sriracha Spicy Buffalo Wings<br /><br />6 chicken wings<br />Oil for frying<br />3 tablespoons Frank's Red Hot Sauce<br />1 tablespoons sriracha<br />1 tablespoons butter, softened<br />Baby mache or other lettuce to garnish<br /><br />Fry the chicken wings until crispy. In a bowl, combine the red-hot sauce, sriracha, and butter. Toss the wings in the sauce and serve. Garnish with baby mache or other lettuce.<br /><br />In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and Tabasco pepper sauce on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars

review/text: I love Sriracha and this satisfies!<br /><br />Stuff you find in restaurants, this stuff keeps very very well. Trust me, I have so much of it now but I've managed to get through most of it... it refrigerates and freezes well...and the keep-by date is still a couple years out.<br /><br />I cook with it, add it to everything to pizazz it up... it is a specific palate so when you need it, you know it ;)<br /><br />Good for home, good for gift... great great deal!
