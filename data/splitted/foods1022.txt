review/summary: Top Tier and Best Buy
review/text: Fallot is one of the top five usually available.  If you cannot find locally, this is the best buy on Amazon.  It is fine in flavor and properly strong.  Shipping is expensive, but stale on the store shelf is 100% waste.<br /><br />Fallot is one of the top tier because of several factors:<br /><br />It is an independent mill in Burgundy.<br /><br />They source their particular strains of Brassica seeds carefully.<br /><br />They use verjuice instead of other liquids.<br /><br />The three pack is a better deal.  But, unless you use a lot of this mustard and fairly regularly, big is false economy.  Do not get a 13.5 oz jar if it takes you six months to use.  It will go first flat and then in another six months completely dead.  So stick with 7 0z. unless you really need it.<br /><br />Dijon is time, heat and light sensitive.  If you buy the three pack, keep all in the refirgerator.

review/summary: Eda's candy
review/text: I LOVE this candy! Since my weight-loss surgery, I can't eat more than 2 grams of sugar at one time. But I can eat up to seven pieces of Eda's candy before it's too much (sorbitol in too large amounts gives people diarrhea). The taste and texture are like the best hard candy I used to eat, and usually five pieces are enough for me. I have obsessive-compulsive disorder, and I have to arrange my candy in the right pattern before I eat it. But each mixed bag has a different quantity of each kind of candy, so I have to get creative with my arranging. I always want to end with licorice, so I ordered a pound of licorice so that I'd have it whether or not the bag contained it.<br /><br />I do not expect to get tired of this candy.

review/summary: tastes like anise instead of licorice
review/text: this definitely does not taste like licorice.  It has a distinct anise taste.  Postage cost nearly as much as the product. I do live in Alaska but priority mail is inexpensive and gets here fast. I bought three different candies from this seller which I had hoped would have saved on the postage but all three came in a bag and cost more than the products. It could have been sent in a priority box for a decent price and would have gotten here faster.  So the shipping was way too much. I usually love sugar free licorice but this is one time I was disappointed.  If you don't' mind anise instead of licorice this candy would be nice.  the individual wrapping does make it easy to put in purse or pockets. so it does have it's benifits.

review/summary: Nice tea for the good price
review/text: Drinking green tea was a part of every day life when I grew up. My mother brew it for the family and the guests every chance she got. Only recently I re-discovered green tea because of some videos in youtube.<br /><br />I'm not a gourmet tea drinker by any means like most Japanese people. I'm not trying to compare it to other green tea but compare to what drank before as a kid.<br />I liked what I re-discovered, at least better than Lipton tea bags and coffee I have been drinking. I'm not into the benefit other people are talking about. I just like the taste, it's relaxing and seems to enhance the taste of food you are eating with. It has fresh grassy(some say sea weed like?) smell when it's first steeped, even though that's not only what I drink it for, it's still nice.<br />I'm still experimenting what's the best way to brew it and so far I found it's best to pour the leaves after the hot water poured in when you use the fresh leaves. After that, I reuse the leaves two or three times(that's the way Japanese people do).<br />I recommend this tea for anybody wanting to try and find out the joy of drinking green tea. Specially for the price, you can't go wrong. Even you find it low quality after you try other higher priced tea, it's nice to have something you can compare to. You'll appreciate more for those higher quality tea.<br />I think, for the most people this teas is good enough for the enjoyment.<br /><br />For the note, this tea has somewhat smaller cut than other tea I can remember. That maybe the reason priced cheaper, and it doesn't affect the taste.

review/text: Kinda pricey but adds an unbelievable level of complexity to pasta - way better than any tomato sauce based pasta I've had here in the states. And it's uncomplicated  to make too. Extra virgin olive oil, slivers of garlic, red pepper flakes gently sauteed in a saucepan, add bottarga, then al dente pasta (I used spaghetti). Add a little pasta water to loosen if needed. Its what anchovies do to the background of dishes without tasting fishy.<br /><br />Suggestion for the seller - if you have recipes for bottarga, post them!

review/text: I've been feeding our two cats this for over a year now and they still love it. One of them has always been a little hefty and after moving he is forced to be an indoor cat, causing him to gain weight. I orignally fed them Halo cat food, which was fine, but contained far too many ingredients. I love how this brand doesnt fill the ingredients full of fillers like corn or any other grains. Great product, terrific company!

review/summary: Fancy food for my pound purry.
review/text: I used to give my cat raw meat patties and the regular (non-light) version of this cat food. Over time, he started to prefer the dry food and ignore the raw meat. We stopped with the meat and switched to the light Natural Balance, and the cat adjusted just fine. This is the least expensive premium cat food I have found, and my cat is healthy and sports a luxurious, glossy coat. He's eaten Natural Balance for two years, and I prefer giving him a protein rich premium cat food in the hopes that he won't develop kidney stones or diabetes, both common ailments for male house cats in their later years.

review/text: First off I love Amazon! This cat food Has done wonders for my large cat. When I first purchased this diet cat food my cat was 21.7 pounds, within two months he had gone down to 19.8, That is 2 POUNDS!! Also ever since I had been feeding my cat Iams(corn based)Cat food he always had flaky dry skin just above his tail. After a few weeks of this cat food it has disappeared and never came back(18 months)!! Also after a month or two his coat was noticeably softer, much softer!! I couldn't believe it!<br /><br />As for the price, Pet supermarket's Regular price here in Florida is $21.97 for a 15 pound bag. That savings might be worth a little extra driving.  CHEERS

review/summary: Great product if you need/prefer to feed dry food
review/text: I've been feeding our indoor cat this food for about two-three years now, and she loves it. I did quite a bit of looking around to find a dry food brand that didn't add a ton of grain fillers and other unhealthy ingredients, and this one does that without completely breaking my bank like some of the higher end cat foods. I prefer to feed my cat wet food since it's healthier for them, but she's a "grazer" during the day, which doesn't work well with wet food. I don't feel bad about giving her a scoop of this in the morning to munch on throughout the day though. The six pound bag lasts her around two months at 1/2-3/4 cup per day. The reduced calorie type is great for her since she's an indoor kitty, and she seems to love the flavor. She's seven years old now and so far has been incredibly healthy plus maintains a normal weight. We always get comments on how soft and beautiful her coat is, and I think it has a lot to do with giving her higher quality food.

review/text: It is hard to find commercially grown cranberries without pesticides.  And from what I can gather, cranberries are one of the fruits with the largest amounts used.  Our family tries to eat a variety of berries as a part of our diet.  We rotate between blueberries, strawberries and cranberries, eating what is in season fresh when we can.  These  cranberries taste great, although I would not mind if they were a little less sweet.  Each pouch claims to contain three 1/4 cup servings, but we usually get four out of a pouch.  On subscribe and save, they are about 66 cents a serving.

review/summary: Newman's Own Dried Cranberries
review/text: Original Review Summer 2008 (original review was no longer attached to item):<br /><br />These are by far the plumpest, juiciest dried cranberries that I have ever tasted. Yes, there is a smidgen of sugar and sunflower oil but I have yet to see any dried cranberries without those added.  I love to toss a handful into cereal--hot or cold--for an added taste treat.<br /><br />Incidentally, these are 6 4-ounce bags of the tasty treats.<br /><br />Update:  I've reduced the number of stars as I have a new favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035IHSLS">Oskri  Cranberries, Dried, 3.53 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>and my choice of 4 stars may be confusing to some.<br /><br />When comparing the two dried cranberries, side-by-side, the Oskri are by far, the better of the two.  When taking the Oskri out of the equation and comparing the Newman's Own cranberries to other brands out there, then Newman's Own stands above the rest.<br /><br />If, what you are looking for is a replacement for all of the varieties out there in the marketplace, then Newman's Own are for you.  If you are looking for a fabulous dried cranberry fit for just munching, then reach for the Oskri.<br /><br />I actually like to keep both brands on hand.  There are times, when I am baking, that the Newman's Own Cranberries are my preferred cranberry.  If I am substituting cranberries for raisins in a recipe, then odds are that I will choose the Newman's Own over the Oskri.  If I am baking something where the cranberry is the centerpiece, then I choose the Oskri.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.

review/summary: Newman's Own makes great dried fruits
review/text: I don't know what they do, but Newman's Own makes dried fruit that is moist yet well preserved. Took a chance after buying some Newman's raisins and the prunes were just as moist. I ended up eating up the bag and getting more. Me eating prunes? That was new. The raisins and the cranberries are great also. Pleasantly surprised with all their dried fruits.

review/summary: Great ingredients, not for my cat however
review/text: I have been having issues finding a food that's good for my 11 year old cat. I was on Blue Buffalo which he liked but it made his waste smell really bad. I then slowly switched to Fromm's Surf 'Turf which he also loves. It seemed to help his poo smell better too.<br />However he throws up all his food about an hour after he eats, not sure if he just can't handle so much fish or if it's too rich for him. Fast forward to today and I got a bag of Wellness Core Indoor cat food. He will not go near it & he usually likes every food I've given him. Im very disappointed as this is not cheap food.I might just back to Blue Buffalo.<br /><br />It's a fantastic food and I really wish my cat liked it. I liked it because it has no fish ingredients and that's better for cats overall. My other cat likes this food so I'd suggest getting a small bag at first.

review/text: I really like these.  They're intensely sweet and have a great 'al dente' texture, and because they're full of potassium and vitamin A, they're totally guiltess, unlike the bag of Swedish Fish I ate yesterday.<br /><br />One caution: because these are unsulfured, they won't look uniformly orange and pretty.  They're brown with blotches of orange, and that's how they're supposed to look

This will help to maintain optimum freshness right up to the expiration date.<br />  2.

review/summary: the best apricots
review/text: These are the best apricots I had ever had-- and I did not even like apricots! they are not orange as most people are used to seeing them in that color -- it is because they are not treated with sulfur dioxide. So don't worry about the color, it dos not signify that it has gone bad. The only fault I find with them is that they are not fom our own country. We need to support our own farmers and workers more than we are -- I personally would be willing to pay more for them if that was the case.

review/summary: Nasty ... Taste like cheap prunes ...
review/text: My wife loves apricots, fresh and dried.  For years, she has been getting me to buy dried Blenheim pitted slabs from [...] for about $[...]/pound (nearly $[...]/pound delivered).  I think that's a lot!<br /><br />I bought this thinking that, at about $[...]/pound delivered, it was a comparative steal.<br /><br />NOPE!  This stuff is dark and pruney, with a nasty, unclean aftertaste.<br /><br />I resent ApricotKing and their high prices, but at least their fruit is bright, fresh and clean tasting.  Newman's stuff is just garbage and, at $[...]/pound, doggone expensive garbage!<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that these are high grade U.S. apricots.  They remind me of those terrible Mediterranean and Turkish apricots I tried once:  Dark brown with a weird "chewing tobacco" aftertaste.

I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived, as it was packed delicately, with the base wrapped to avoid dirt and rocks moving throughout the package.

review/summary: Very pleased!
review/text: I purchased these little gems last week on a whim, after researching the history of the Abbaye de Flavigny. They have been making these candies since the year 1591! Anise is an acquired taste, I think, akin to a delicate licorice, and those who enjoy it will absolutely love these anise drops. A fact I found quite interesting is that it takes fifteen days to make just one of these candies!<br /><br />Each candy is roughly the size of a medium pearl, with a pleasantly smooth texture. They are not meant to be chewed, (the word "jaw-breaker" comes to mind!) but savored. The taste is exquisite: strong but not overpowering, herbal and sweet. At the heart of each drop is an anise seed, the texture of which contrasts beautifully with the hardness of the candy surrounding it. Very refreshing.<br /><br />I am so glad that I stumbled upon these! They are a real treasure in a world where artificial flavorings and chemical-based sweeteners are the norm. There is something quite special about these Anise Drops from Abbaye de Flavigny.<br /><br />As for the seller, Touch of Europe, I couldn't be happier with their service. My package arrived quickly, (two days before the estimated arrival time!) wrapped safely, and included a hand-signed letter thanking me for my business, which I thought was a nice touch.

review/summary: Easy to "brew" in Keurig
review/text: Green tea is a strange tea to most Americans, I like it, and I do drink it regularly but I always think it needs something, so for iced green tea I splash it with some cranberry juice to sweeten and give it a slight tang.  I actually make two 6 ounce cups out of one green tea K-cup because I have been told by friends who have drunk green tea since childhood that it is meant to be used more than one time.  I do see now that some loose leaf green tea actually tells you to brew more than once.  A 12 ounce pot of green tea made from one K-cup is a perfect cup, especially when sweetened with juice for an iced drink.

review/text: I bought this for my dad because he likes green tea. And most K-cup packs come assorted so I found this. I think it a bit more per K-cup than buying an assortment but if you just want green tea then this is a good buy because thats all you get. I tried one just to see how it taste and it taste like a ordinary green tea if not a little better. You arn't gonna get a super high quality green tea but it taste all right. Also if you want to stretch your money then you can do what I do and use the K-cup multiple times for a slightly lighter green tea, since it contains the leaves.

review/summary: Green Tea on the bland side
review/text: I guess when I was using tea bags that I must have brewed my tea to be quite strong.  This leaves me disappointed in the strength of the cup of tea regardless of the size of cup I brew.  Obviously the larger the cup the weaker it is, but I just don't think that leaf tea can be brewed effectively in under a minute...<br /><br />Not sure how they would remedy this problem, I think it is a lack of steeping time.  I love my Keurig for coffee, but the teas in general have been a bummer as they all seem weak to me.

Before I switched to Keurig, I used STASH Camomile, and it was great. This one is tepid and tasteless. I am never going to order any Bigelow product for my Keurig. It's too expensive to waste. Right now I use the Sleepytime and put an "Espresso" shot of the Bigelow Camomile in to use up the 24-pack. If you love Camomile, don't buy this one.

This milk chocolate is also of highest quality.<br /><br />Lubeck Niederegger is the best, highest quality of Marzipan! This is a lovely gift-<br />highly appreciated. Keeps for months (keep it cool, OK in fridge).<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is like no other! Search them on the web for the full story. Highest quality Marzipan originated in Turkey, under the Ottomans. When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they brought Marzipan with them. -The Croissant bread (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming-<br /><br />The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site -a nice site! Great site-learn about Marzipan quickly-nice story.<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar makes the best Marzipan.  No filler, no almond extracts.<br />Lower quality Marzipans need that since they have a lower concentration of almonds.<br /><br />With WWII, the Cafe Niederegger in Lubeck, Germany (East Germany for many years) was destroyed: 1942 "The caf&eacute; was destroyed by bombing and the company's archives went up in flames."<br /><br />Thankfully, the cafe  was rebuilt & this fine Marzipan is still available. With German reunification, it is easier to get this great marzipan again. Highly recommended!<br /><br /> Excellent! Enjoy!

review/text: I've tried the millet and the corn too and all are very good but I like the rice best.  As another reviewer so helpfully mentioned, you can add crispness by nuking a bowl of the puffed grains for ten seconds or so.  Mainly I eat this rice with a little olive oil and sea salt but it's good in so many other ways.  It does dissolve quickly and completely so it's excellent for thickening up other foods, just mix in and let sit and something thin will become nice and thick.  My diet allows for two and one half batches of whole grains, generally either quinoa or one of the Lundberg brown rice blends, per week.  I can trade the one  half batch (one half cup uncooked) for five cups of puffed rice and add some variety for about the same calories.  Plus the puffed rice is always ready to eat for times when I'm in a hurry but out of prepared food.

The fact that it is sugar free is just as nice because we are also trying to watch our kids sugar intake.<br /><br />The ingredients are stated clearly in the product description (puffed, WHOLE GRAIN BROWN RICE... so it still has all the nutrition left in it rather than scoured off as in white rice) so there should be no confusion if you are a person who actually READS directions and ingredients... and the fact that it is about as pure a food as you can get in a plastic bag is a real big plus. There are enough cereals on the shelves covered in sugar and filled with ingredients that are not good for you or questionable at best.<br /><br />This can be added to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVLS2O">Arrowhead Mills Puffed Millet, 6-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)</a> and/or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVNWSM">Arrowhead Mills Puffed Kamut, 6-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)</a> to make a Muesli. Kamut has gluten in it so don't add if you are on a Gluten Free diet. Add to dried fruits and nuts (raisins, currants, sunflower seed, coconut, etc) to make a trail mix for a healthy snack on the road.<br /><br />It also makes a great finger food for babies as they are small enough to make them work on their fine motor skills, and they generally loose interest in eating it before they have eaten too much - remember, if you read the description it says it is NOT a low calorie food. You and your children can eat too much of anything even if it is supposed to be healthy!<br /><br />I'm looking forward to ordering the case size and saving over grocery store prices...<br /><br />Mrs. P.

This is whole grain and gluten free and I have found it works either for a meal or dry to pop in your mouth as a snack.<br /><br />When my children were little, I used to give them a zip-lok bag of puffed rice for a snack as I was pushing them around the mall in a stroller or in the car.  They are in their 20's and they still pop this cereal into their mouths when they need a "snack on the run".

Its about 2.00 a bag, if you include the shipping, but for a non-sweetened cereal and fat free snack food this is pretty good. Not fancy, no marshmallows, gummy bears or crap in it.

review/text: I got these for my 9 month old.  He enjoys eating them and trying to pick them up himself.  I think we went over board buying in bulk....he eats maybe a tbsp at a time.  Definitely need to invest in those airlock containers to keep the little puffs fresh.  A six ounce bag takes up about the same room as a regular size bag of cereal.  We were shocked at how much we got... Worth the Price though.  We aren't starting wheat snacks until 12 months, great cheerios substitute!

review/summary: Have half a bag every day for breakfast.
review/text: I've been having half a bag of this cereal every morning for years. Hate when I can't find the stuff. That's why I am here on Amazon looking to see if it's available. Arrrowhead Mills makes a bunch of other puffed cereals, and all of them are good, but the millet is my favorite for several reasons. First off, I have a problem with my jaw. If I buy their puffed corn (which is terrific) my jaw will pop out before I can get halfway through a bowl of the stuff. The puffed rice is delicious but it gets soggy fast. I'm allergic to wheat.<br /><br />The millet is perfect. Tastes kind of like mild popcorn. The grains are really small so if you have a TMJ problem like me, chewing it is no problem. Best of all, it never gets soggy in milk. You can take a dozen phone calls and come back to a bowl of it and it will still be fine.<br /><br />Only problem with millet is the hulls. Every now and then, whatever method they use to remove the hulls from the bags gets out of adjustment and you end up with a hefty portion of hulls in the bag. These little buggers can get stuck between your teeth or in the back of your throat and they tend to stay stuck for a while.

review/summary: Not Gluten Free
review/text: We ordered these for my granddaughter, who is part of a family of celiac and gluten allergic people, and who is showing signs of some food allergies.  Although they are advertised as gluten free, the cookies contain barley flour which is NOT gluten free.  We were attracted to these cookies as they were advertised as gluten and dairy free, as well as organic and non GMO. The box itself is labeled as organic and non GMO but does not mention any of the food allergies mentioned on Amazon.  We are very disappointed about this and had actually opened the box and let her have one before we realized the problem.  She did enjoy the cookie, so apparently it tasted good to her.  If it were not for the misinformation and potentially very dangerous error about being gluten and allergen free on the Amazon page, they would be great for other consumers.  However, it's hard to understand how this potentially dangerous of a mistake could be made.  These are not cookies we feel comfortable using, and my daughter is so gluten sensitive that she can't actually touch the cookies to feed them to her daughter even if the baby wasn't showing signs of allergy.

review/summary: A great addition in recipes
review/text: Over time, I have tried to minimize the amount of salt that I use in cooking or adding to the final dish after it has been prepared.  Salt is not necessarily the healthiest part of our diets.<br /><br />However, this product adds a nice touch to dishes (used moderately). The standard salt out of the cardboard boxes is pretty bland. Grinding sea salt crystals produces a much nicer flavor enhancement.<br /><br />This is a great companion with the pepper grinder made by the same company. I still am conservative in my use of salt, but this serves my purposes in cooking much better than the normal "out of the box" salt.

BUT when you finally finish the spice, you'll discover that the bottle is designed not to be refilled.  You'll have to throw it away and buy another. You probably won't even be able to recycle it because the glass and plastic parts are inseparable.  This is a very disappointing flaw in an otherwise great product.

review/summary: Unable to recycle grinder
review/text: Although the spices provided by Drogheria & Alimentari are excellent, it is annoying to discover that the grinders are not recyclable.  I attempted a method which is successful for other grinders.  I soaked the grinder (upside down) in a glass of almost boiling water for at least 5 minutes.  By sliding a dull knife under the plastic cover of McCormack grinders, the cover becomes loose enough so that it can be pulled away from the glass.  This method does not work for Drogheria & Alimentari grinders.<br />Since recycling is mandatory in some communities nowadays, I would think that these grinders should be improved to facilitate recycling, before someone gets hurt attempting to separate the glass from the top of the grinder.

review/text: Eden Organic's tomato canned products CONTAIN BPA.  Their canned beans are BPA free that is why it is confusing.  I called the company to verify. Unfortunately, I bought a whole case of them before I found out they contain BPA.<br /><br />I asked Eden Organics if they had any plans to provide their tomato products in BPA free packaging such as jars but they said no, they are not equipped for it.<br /><br />I think I will call again and let them know I am interested in BPA free tomato products, maybe if they get enough feedback from customers, they will make BPA free tomato products.  Their number if you are interested is 1-888-424-EDEN (3336) or you can email them at info@edenfoods.com. Their website is [...]<br /><br />I have found some tomato products that are not in cans.  I found most of them at the health food store, but have seen some at our regular grocery store now so hopefully the demand for such products is being heard.  I have not used these products yet, but will be doing so this weekend. I wish I had kept track of the prices. I believe they are all BPA free but not sure if maybe the jar lids have some BPA, nonetheless exposure would be considerably less than a whole can lining.<br /><br />Bionaturae - Organic tomato paste (in jars)<br />Bionaturae - Organic strained tomatoes (in jars)<br />Cirio - Passata Rustica, crushed tomatoes (in jars)<br />Lucini - Organics Tuscan Harvest plum tomatoes, whole, peeled (in jars)<br />Pomi - chopped tomatoes (tetra pak - like a milk carton)<br /><br />From what I have been told, the FDA has not approved any BPA free can liners for tomatoes--not sure if this is true.  Tomatoes are very acidic so they leach the aluminum from the cans that is why they are lined by something impervious to the acid hence the lining that contains BPA.  Frankly, I think I would prefer the aluminum over BPA.  I do know that if they went back to the linings they used before BPA was used, it would shorten the shelf life of the product because the lining they used to use disintegrates over time due to the acidity of the tomatoes and the tomatoes would taste like aluminum.

However, contrary to what other reviewers have said above, their tomatoes do come in cans whose linings contain BPA-- just like ALL OTHER CANNED TOMATOES!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I'm not sure what to do about canned tomatoes now-- and I use a lot of them. You can find some packed in jars (I believe they're Italian)-- not nearly as convenient as cans.

I had the pleasure and priviledge of living there for almost 3 years and associated with a wide range of people.<br />This tea is the typical tea one finds almost everywhere.  I have purchased many types of green tea before finding this lovely, middle of the road tea.  More expensive tea is available and it is quite delicious.  However, I wanted to taste a tea which took my taste buds and imagination back to the homes and shops of friends.<br />This tea is common, the tea of the people.  Not the stuff of tea ceremony, but a link to the Japan I knew and loved.<br />If you want to find a good, inexpensive tea that you can drink all day and enjoy the simplicity of brewing cup after cup, Ban-cha is the one.

review/summary: Simply the Best
review/text: I am a regular tea drinker, have been for years. I have always bought tea based on the social and environmental conscience of the company and the ingredients and processing of the tea, and so I picked up some Yorkshire tea one day.<br />It made a good stout pot of tea with a single tea bag, gave a satisfactory morning cup -- no complaints here.<br />When it was gone, I couldn't find more, so I bought another brand. I didn't think anything of it. I've never been a one-tea woman. I can love 'em and leave 'em.<br />But I couldn't stop thinking of Yorkshire Tea. I pined for it. No other tea seemed quite as good. I would be drinking some other tea, and thinking of Yorkshire Tea.<br />Fortunately, I discovered that I can get it from Amazon. Actually, it is sent from another company, so I have to pay shipping, but they always send enough sample tea that the shipping costs are covered by the samples.<br />So now, sure, I flirt with Earl Grey or Cinnamon tea, having a cup in the afternoon or evening. But it has to be Yorkshire Tea for that first morning cuppa.

review/summary: As good as you get in Columbia at the Bogata Airport!
review/text: For ten years I was buying coffee flavored hard candy in Peru and Columbia and carrying it home since we couldn't find anything available in the US even close to the really good South American coffee flavor.<br />When I retired we moved to a location in Washington where a local grocery store stocked this candy in their bulk candy section for $2.99 a pound. It was great. We devoured it.<br />Then about a year ago they quit stocking it and said they couln't get it anymore. They moved to some other coffee hard candy at $7 a pound and it didn't cut it for that price. Nor did it have the flavor of the Colombina candy.<br />I found Colombina about a year ago on Amazon and we have been buying it ever since. This latest 5 pound price is lower than our last purchase and its a great buy.<br />The candy is very flavorful..not too strong and not too weak...just right.<br />Add on a day later..<br />I went to order 2 five pound bags and almost croaked when it came up just under $16 shipping and handling. Last time in was free shipping. Needless to say, while good candy, its not so good when you add a $1.60 a pound for the freight and the price increase is hidden as shipping.<br />Amazon initially sent me a notice saying I would receive it May 24th, so I wrote the supplier. They emailed me back immediately saying it would be one week and Amazon, for some reason supplies a bad date. Good quick response.

review/summary: greatest taste and wonderful value
review/text: I love coffee candy but those smaller boxes of movie size packages is just a small sample of what you can get in value and enough to share with friends, family, and neighbors. There are several different flavors in each package. In this tight economy, this is the gift you could buy, split up into 10 gifts and re-gift. Your friends will be thrilled and you could easily earn points with the boss or your new clients.

review/summary: A solid cup of coffee!
review/text: These candies are imported from Colombia, and are very difficult to find in the Chicago area.  They are the best coffee flavored candy I've ever found, and taste like you are truly having a cup of coffee in a solid form...what a taste treat!

review/summary: Not the same as previous petco catnip spray
review/text: I bought this because our cat just loves the petco catnip spray that we had gotten years ago. Apparently something in the way they make it is not the same, because our cat sniffs and walks away. It's definitely got more of a minty smell than the other, so I'm guessing that's what she doesn't like.
