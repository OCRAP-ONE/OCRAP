review/summary: Filling and tastes great with a few additions
review/text: As a big fan of Bob's Red Mill products in general I thought I'd try ordering this since my grocery store does not sell it. I don't need to talk about the health benefits as you can all read the nutritional label.<br /><br />I do find the taste/texture of this cereal takes some getting used to. It's a bit like eating sand. In order to make it taste better, the following healthy additions work for me:<br /> 2 packs of splenda and cinnamon to taste<br /> 1-2 Tbsp of fat free vanilla yogurt, greek yogurt or cottage cheese to make it creamier<br /> optional: dried fruit or stewed prunes<br /><br />I sometimes mix this 50/50 with regular oatmeal, which also gives it great texture.

review/summary: My breakfast fix for years now!!
review/text: A few years ago, I lost 50 pounds and this was a big reason why... a  high fiber breakfast that held me for hours!  I've used it to keep the weight off, and enjoy how quick and easy it is.  Sprinkle it into a bowl, add some water, throw it in the microwave... I enjoy mixing in thick rolled oats, flax meal, bananas, berries, anything for variety when needed... soymilk on top and you're good to go!  Love it!!!

review/summary: Good hot cereal for one who doesn't usually like cereal
review/text: I'm not a cereal fan in any way, but my roommate was diagnosed with high blood pressure, cholesterol and borderline diabetes, so I thought I'd introduce this to him. He puts raisins or prunes or fresh fruit and vanilla soy milk on his. After a couple of months, I tried it and was surprised how good it is. I put olive oil, nutritional yeast, and Bragg's Liquid Aminos on mine and actually look forward to eating it, which is pretty good for a person who doesn't normally eat first thing in the morning, and certainly not hot cereal. It's a good, healthy start to the day, and though I don't have a roommate any more, I'll keep eating this cereal. Subscribe and Save is a great convenience and it's better priced than local stores.

review/text: If you like good hot cereal & not the microwave 'quick oats' mush, you'll like this.  It has a nutty flavor that's especially good when mixed with old fashioned oatmeal (5Tbsp Oats to 3Tbsp Bob's, add hot H20 & microwave for 2 minutes...I add ~1Tbsp chopped walnuts & ~1Tbsp raisins).  It keeps me going till lunch.  I have not tried it by itself as I like to mix cereals whether hot or cold.

review/summary: Doesn't work for me as a cereal...Maybe as an addition to bread recipes
review/text: The taste and texture of this cereal just doesn't excite my taste buds.  I would agree with another reviewer's point that I would need to add fruit, nuts and sweetener to make this tolerable as a cereal.  However...I tried a recipe on the bag for whole grain muffins that ARE TO DIE FOR, so all is not lost.  Another reviewer adds it to her bread, so today's experiment is with my honey wheat bread recipe.  Might also be good in my whole grain pancakes. It is excellent as a source of whole grains and fiber, but not a winner in the unadorned cereal category.

review/summary: Too much like instant
review/text: What I don't like about instant oatmeal is the mushy texture.  I thought I would have been able to get away from that with this product, but I was mistaken.  My fault for not looking at the image more closely, I guess.  I now make this an addition to my steel-cut oats after it cooks for about 10 minutes.  I find this also a little on the expensive side, but I cannot afford to store large quantities of the separate components of this cereal because my housing is temporary, so this product is good for that.  Otherwise, if you can afford to buy the components separately, I'd recommend it.

So I now bump up my oats by doing half and half with this cereal.  I might have needed more mix ins (the taste of the cereal overpowered mine), but I'm happy to mix with oats.  Eventually I'll have to try baking something just to add this in.

review/summary: Very healthy high fiber cereal.
review/text: This cereal has a slight earthy flavor due to flaxseeds. After first two bowls I got used to it, and now I like this cereal a lot. I cooked it on the stove (which takes 10 minutes). Then I decided to cook it in the microwave (it takes 3 minutes), and found out that it tastes exactly the same and saves me time. I put raisins, craisins, nuts and honey in this cereal, and it tastes great! It has 10 grams of fiber per serving and keeps you satisfied until lunch. Besides, it is all organic. What more can you wish? Great breakfast cereal.

review/summary: Great-tasting, high fiber breakfast in 2 minutes!
review/text: After learning what was really in my Quaker oatmeal packets, I decided to go for something more natural and more full of wholegrains and fiber. Bob's Red Mill has never let me down with a product. I make this cereal in the microwave at work everyday and it only takes two minutes. I add in a bit of brown sugar, honey, or some fruit pieces and really enjoy a filling, healthy breakfast. I'm not one to get all worked up over cereal, but really, it's a thousand times better than anything I've ever had in a packet and the price is right!

review/summary: Perfect, well almost.....if you don't mind sweetening.
review/text: I really want to like this cereal. It reminds me of the hot mush my grandma used to make which was a mixture of oatmeal, cream of wheat, and wheatena. The texture is excellent, not at all gluey like pure oatmeal. Mixed with maple syrup and yogurt I was very very pleased.<br /><br />However there is one problem you need to know. This cereal has a slight bitter aftertaste when you don't add anything to it or mix it with anything. I am not quite sure what it is due to, and I can't taste the bitterness if I mix it with a good amount of honey, or brown sugar, or butter or maple syrup. However if you like to eat your cereal without any sweetening added at all then I think it is not the right cereal for you.<br /><br />I think if you mix this hot cereal with other cereals it will improve their texture and you probably wont notice the aftertaste.

review/summary: satisfying and good for you
review/text: Since I have a hot water boiler in the kitchen, my process of making this is to pour 2x boiling water over the high fiber cereal, mix it up, and then stick it in the microwave for a minute. I let that stand for a minute or two to cool down, then pour in milk or yogurt to taste and mix it up. I find dried cranberries are sweet enough to let me forgo any other sweetener. Other good options are granola, dried apples, or sliced bananas. I do notice the bitterness of the wheat germ if I have it plain with no milk product, but quite like the result once I add milk or fruit.

review/text: LOVE this cereal!  I eat it as cereal almost as much as I use it in my breads.  Read the ingredients - everything in it is what should be in a loaf of bread.  When I make bread, I sub in 25% of this cereal for all purpose flour, sub another 25% of the all purpose flour with whole wheat and the flavor is wonderful.  Try 10% the next time you use Mark Bittman's No Knead Bread recipe.  AMAZING!  For the people in my life who prefer their oatmeal in flakes, I use about 30% of this to 70% Bob rolled oats.  We buy it regularly.  Try it!

review/summary: another winner from Bob's
review/text: Everything from Bob's that I have tried has been very good, and this is no exception. As some reviewers have mentioned, it can taste a little bland by itself, but as there is no law that I have to eat it plain, I add various things and it is delicious. My current favorites are some huckleberries and/or blackberries (picked last summer and frozen). When I run out of them, raisins or craisins with some banana works very nicely. A sprinkle of cinnamon, some butter and brown sugar and I am set for hours. Add some walnuts, pecans or hazelnuts and it practically qualifies as a dessert!<br /><br />In addition to the great taste, the high fiber content is a real plus. Most of use don't even come close to eating enough fiber, and this is an easy, healthy, yummy way of fixing that.

review/summary: Nice congee substitute
review/text: Having grown up in a Chinese household, I love me some congee.  However, like anything made with white rice, the nutritional benefits of congee are rather limited by its glycemic index.<br /><br />I've found that Bob's Red Mill Hot Cereal is a more-than-acceptable substitute for congee.  I make up a bowl of this (with a little extra water, since I prefer it a little soupy) and have it with some fish or Asian pickles, just as I would with plain congee.  I make my congee Taiwanese-style (whole white rice, lots of water), and find that if I add just a little sugar to the hot cereal, I get an equivalent hint of "white rice" sweetness.  This has made my breakfasts much healthier than before.<br /><br />Good stuff.  I recommend it.

Greatly disappointed. The seller cares more about selling the product for profit than customer service. the health benefits of the product make it worthwhile, although I personally gagged the first two times I tried to have this without additions like stevia, honey, and some dried fruit. but that is just my personal taste, i dont like bitter things and this is extremely bitter on its own. when stevia or tablespoon of honey is added with some fruit, this is not bad at all. just need to find it in the stores.

review/summary: Updated Dec 2011 - Incredibly Delicious and Easy!!
review/text: This is my favorite breakfast cereal and Amazon Subscribe and Save means I don't have to hunt for it all over town.<br /><br />Contains no salt or sweetener, so I control what goes in.  I prepare it stovetop in a small Corning cook/eat bowl, just large enough to make my portion and top it with milk when it's ready.  My 'formula' is 1 cup water, 1/2 cup cereal, 2 pinches of kosher salt and a drizzle of maple syrup - stir.  Bring to a boil, turn the gas down to the minimum, stir again, partially cover and time for 5-6 minutes.  When I want a heartier breakfast, I'll stir in some almonds, cashews, dried cranberries (Trader Joe's) before topping up with milk.<br /><br />I used to think that cooking cereal would be too inconvenient, then realized there are always a few morning chores that have to be taken care of anyway, so now I get them done while it simmers.  Love it year round, except on the hottest summer days.<br /><br />A few friends who swear by steel cut oatmeal now buy this as well, to jazz up their routine.<br /><br />P.S. Update:  My cook and eat bowl is an oldie - the current versions are NOT usable on the stovetop.  Many thanks to S. Sims for pointing this out!!

review/summary: Blandest thing I've ever tasted, and I'm hard on those who complain about their food
review/text: I've seen a lot of products on here and not only do I cringe but I criticize people when they complain about the taste of food for various reasons. I purchased this, solely for awesome, healthy, thick and colorful bowel movements. I wanted them, but wasn't getting them. So I ate this and in terms of flavor, any flavor, give me a snap crackle or pop, I received nothing. My tongue and body were analyzing it as if it were an alien. I thought, the solution was easy, grab some toppings and that should take care of the problem, right? So I put peanuts in the cereal, like an elephant, and the cereal was so strong in its stubborn ways-like kryptonite, it made the peanuts bland. So I said, ok fine, we're going to have to get the big guns here. I went out and purchased honey. The major religious books talk about milk and honey all the time, you can't get more sweeter and flavorful than honey. I put a significant amount of honey in my bowl and the forces were so strong with this one, it devoured the distinct flavor of honey like a fat kid devours a cake when left alone in a room. So, every time thereafter when I consumed cereal bowls of this product, it would be like a contest. I'd have a contest with myself. The contest would be, how fast and efficient can I be in consuming this with a spoon? And I'd set a record and the next day, when I'd eat it again, I'd try to beat that record-like a marathon. Training for the Olympics. Ten big spoonfuls one day, maybe nine or eight the next. And the thing is, I didn't notice any bowel improvement. I expected unicorns and vibrant rainbows to come out of my a** and it was like a wasteland just decimated with poverty, hopelessness and abandonment. I gave the cereal two stars instead of one because I presume this has some healthy benefits with the flaxseed and the whole grains and whatnot. If you don't believe me that's fine. Purchase this and bring a sword to the table. You're going to do battle with the dragon, my friend.

review/summary: Excellent unrefined sweetner; Pricey
review/text: I have been in search of an unrefined sweetner to replace agave sweetner (for my baby's nut milk - dairy intolerance).  I did the research, and this is it.  The health benefits are fantastic.  However, the price is so high I will unfortunately have to go back to raw agave sweetner.  The taste is very similar to agave, a little less sweet, leans toward maple syrup but not as rich (a bonus in my book).  My 3 year old and 1 year old both like the nut milk sweetened this way.  Other down side, it takes almost twice as much as the agave to sweeten appropriately, though I haven't used for anything but nut milk.  I think it's significantly better than brown rice syrup.  If you have the money to support the "habit," this is definitely the real deal.

review/text: I have to ignore my coconut nectar in the cabinet. It is wonderful! I have been known to eat it by the spoonful all by itself. I'm still on the first bottle (I have more), so my ignorance is proven to be valuable. The next batch of fudge I make will be sweetened with this. YUM-ALICIOUS!!

review/summary: Wonderful nectar  and substitute for honey, agave, or maple syrup
review/text: This coconut nectar is delicious and has a unique tasty flavor.  I am a type II diabetic and the coconut nectar does not raise my blood sugar at all. I am using this as a sweetner in baked goods, as a syrup on gluten free almond and coconut flour pancakes and waffles, as a dressing for fruit salad,sweetner in whipped cream and homemade cheesecake.  I also used this along with Coconut Secret's Coconut Aminos in making homemade ketchup and barbeque sauce.  The flavor of the coconut nectar really enhances both.<br /><br />I only wish it came in a discounted 4 or 6 pack or a bigger bottle.  It can be a bit pricey. That being said, a little goes a long way for sweetner. I also use coconut palm sugar regularly for baked goods but I find the flavor of this raw coconut nectar much more flavorful and the texture of the baked goods more moist.

review/text: I needed to severely cut down on my sugar intake, and also want to stay away from artificial/chemical sweeteners. Stevia is ok but still gives me that aftertaste that I don't find appealing. It's good for some things, but not everything. This product is amazing! I'm so glad to have found something that is sold in its natural, organic, raw state that is low-glycemic and actually good for you!

review/summary: Try it out
review/text: I tried this as an agave substitute, since I'm not a big agave fan. This is thicker than agave. It has a pleasant mild, almost maple-like flavor (and I believe I can taste a hint of coconut). I like the low glycemic index. It does taste a little less sweet when using spoonful for spoonful in replacing agave. But I'm trying to kick the sugar habit, so it's both helping me get accustomed to things a little less sweet while not overpowering the flavor of whatever I make it with. Ounce by ounce it's probably similar in cost if not less than maple syrup. Since I only use it in occasional recipes, I'm willing to pay, although that was the reason I did not choose five stars. But health isn't free!

review/text: I totally love this product and use it in place of sugar or honey or syrup on cereals, waffles, and desserts.  I like it above Stevia which sometimes can leave a bitter taste. Coconut Secret remains sweet. It was created for diabetic use, having  a low glycemic index.  It's actually made from the flowers of the tree rather than the coconuts themselves - just a great and tasty product.

review/summary: Obviously, it's a refined product
review/text: I've only used the nectar on pancakes.  It's actually quite good.  It has a nice smooth consistency, like maple syrup, but is thick and stringy like molasses.  It also has a slight buttery taste that makes it quite excellent on pancakes. But what I like best about it is that 1 serving = 1 Tbsp (15ml) and because of the intensity of the sweetness, I don't need more than a Tbsp- 1.5 Tbsp for a stack of pancakes!  Each serving is 55 calories, 20mg of sodium and 13g of sugar. I'm only adding this information, because I didn't see it in the description.<br /><br />A previous reviewer identified this as an unrefined product.  Ridiculous and literally impossible. Please don't fall for the raw hype.

review/text: i purchased this after reading the fantastic reviews and description about the product. It might just be me, but I did not like it. It smells sweeater than what it actually tastes. I got a  headache just by the smell. I was looking to replace agave nectar and wanted a vegan solution (not honey anymore)... but i found that to achieve the optimal sweetness i had to use more than of the previously mentioned products. I am a bit dissapointed with myself because i love sweet and i thought i would like this. But this wasnt the case.

review/summary: Not Overly Minty
review/text: While I have several of the Torani brand sugar free syrups at home, and love them all, I would have to say out of all of them, the mint one isn't "minty enough," especially considering I'm using it as an add in to coffees or actual recipes. In short, I find the minty-ness a bit muted and diluted when in a mixed drink.<br /><br />Torani provides a flavorful, sugar-free alternative. All their syrups are of high quality and consistent. But the mint one, IMHO, isn't my favorite, even though I want it to be.

review/summary: A great flavor for adding to your coffee or to your baking!
review/text: If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes, over shaved ice and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />This flavor is good in your coffee an also for baking low calorie muffins or cakes.  It jazzes up the flavor without adding calories or a lot of salt. It only contains 5 mg of salt.  I have attached a photo of the label for your review. You can add more flavoring to suit your taste.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!

review/summary: Jif Rocks!
review/text: I love JIF Peanut Butter, especially since it's one of my favorite peanut butters that I grew up with during my childhood years since I used to use it a lot for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, JIF is my 2nd favorite peanut butter in the whole wide world, but PETER PAN is my favorite in the whole wide world, but when I can't find PETER PAN in a 28 OZ or 40 OZ size jar, I end up buying JIF in that size as a 2nd alternative, especially since I can never find PETER PAN in a 28 Ounce or 40 Ounce size at the stores anymore and only carry PETER PAN in the 16 OZ size for some reason which is perhaps due to PETER PAN being outsold by JIF and SKIPPY since I can always find SKIPPY and JIF in a 28 OZ or 40 OZ size at most grocery stores.<br /><br />Additionally, I find it hard to understand why Amazon sells JIF and SKIPPY in a 40 OZ sized jar individually and wont sell PETER PAN in a 40 OZ size individually, plus it baffles me why Amazon charges you $12 bucks to buy this size product online to buy one 40 Ounce jar of JIF when you can buy it at the grocery store or a retail store in this exact same size for under $8 or $9 bucks too.

review/summary: Huge disappointment
review/text: I love black bean soups of all types, but this is the first perfectly awful recipe I've ever encountered.  First of all many additional ingredients are required (whole purple onion, quart of chicken broth, orange juice) and it is very labor-intensive and time-consuming to produce.  The seasoning packet is way too heavy on the cumin, which I think is a Tex-Mex aberration.  There are almost as many black eye peas in the bag as black beans and they don't taste the same.  The final result is that the potentially lovely black bean taste is completely overwhelmed by the cumin and orange juice.  The soup just taste funny.  I've got three remaining bags to give away. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NGATQA">Frontier Soups Hearty Meals Texas Wrangler Black Bean Soup, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>

There's just no comparison.<br /><br />These babies are pretty expensive, but we can't eat any other chips now because they all taste artificial or too greasy.

review/summary: Fabulous new and refreshing flavor!
review/text: I love Crystal Light and I love Mojitos, so I had high hopes for the new Crystal Light Mojito mocktail.  I was not disappointed!  It has a lovely lemon-lime taste with a hint of refreshing mint.  Just mix, add ice cubes, and it is a wonderful summer treat.  Unlike lemonade, it seems to quench my thirst rather than increase it.  It mixes easily and has a very light mint green tint and a tart lime scent.  It brings back visits to Disneyland for me, since they have Mint Juleps in New Orleans Square by the railroad.<br /><br />I wouldn't even consider this to be a wonderful substitute for when you don't want the crazy calories of a real Mojito (an 8 oz glass is 5 calories vs a Mojito at 160 calories), when you are the designated driver, or any other reason to stay away from the version with alcohol.  It's just too delicious in its own right and you don't need an excuse!<br /><br />I found them at my local grocery store for three bucks each, but I'm sure it isn't easy to get these everywhere.  Each canister has 5 packets, and each packet makes 2 quarts.<br /><br />UPDATE: this is the response I got from Kraft when asking if these would be available.<br />We are delighted to hear of your interest in our CRYSTAL LIGHT Mocktail Powdered Soft Drink Mix. As you may already know, this product is only being manufactured and distributed for a limited period of time. For that reason, we are unable to provide any additional information on the stores that may still have the product in stock.

review/text: I've only tried the Mojito flavor and was somewhat disappointed. It starts off well; no real alcohol flavor or smell (so it's safe for work-- ha!).

review/summary: The BEST Crystal Light ever!
review/text: they had this on a special display at my grocery store in Texas.  i got one of each (Mojito, Marguerita, and Appletini) -- the Appletini was my least fave, although still tasty - i'm just not that into apples.  the Mojito is AWESOME and the Marguerita flavor really captures the essence of the drink without the tequila.  I went to three stores today looking for this product and NOTHING.  I'm so bummed and the price on Amazon is really high.  I'm hoping that Crystal Light will decide to market these items widespread so i'll be able to get them again.

review/summary: Mojito Crystal Light
review/text: I would give this 3.5 stars if I could. At first I was delighted with the flavor. It does taste similar to a mojito, which was their purpose in making this. The problem is if you drink too much, that mint (as in the leaf) flavor will start to overpower the drink. So if you want to try this out, I would advise not to drink too much of it at one time. I poured a small glass and enjoyed that first glass, then poured another, but was unable to finish it. And I believe the mint leaf is what the other reviewers were talking about when they mentioned an after taste. Also, adding ice cubes to your glass makes the drink taste better. So drink it cold and drink it in moderation!

review/summary: An Incredibly Refreshing Sugar-Free Cooler
review/text: I am a "Plus-Size" person and between my Dentist and every other Health Professional I encounter, I have gotten it through my head that reducing my sugar intake and putting away at LEAST 2 Liters of water each day are both Really Good Things. Plain water is boring. When I mentioned that each morning I fill a 64 - ounce Insulated Mug with Ice, Water and Crystal Light, my Doctor said "Perfect!". I have been looking for a nice, tart Limeade mix that doesn't involve squeezing mass quantities of limes, buying and measuring out dried lime powder or buying bottles of Lime juice. This stuff EXCEEDS my expectations. It reminds me - strongly - of the taste of a "Mint Julep" beverage sold at a certain local theme park. Use Club Soda in place of water, and it's a dead ringer (Minus the Sugar). Run out and try it! (AFTER I stock up, of course.) ;-)

review/summary: Great tasting cappucino in a convenience can
review/text: This is cappuccino in an 8.45 oz can, just a bit more than a regular 12 oz soda can. You won't get the, "You got milk mustache" or some cute latte art, but you can really taste a nice combination of strong coffee flavor and milk - tastes great. 100 calories.<br /><br />The milk comes from rBST free cows (I first had to Google it to know what it means), meaning no injection with artificial hormones to increase production of milk. RBST is already banned in Canada, Japan, New Zealand, etc., but not in the US yet.<br /><br />Not better than the hot cappuccino served with the traditional atmosphere, but if you need to run, you can just grab one and throw it in you bag.<br /><br />Product of Denmark.

review/summary: illy issimo cappuccino
review/text: Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids. To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.

review/summary: Love this food
review/text: I weaned my 3 cats from a Science Diet menu that they've been on for the past 2+ years.  I've been disgusted with the whole pet food debacle of late and figured that if I could treat my diet well that my cats deserved the same.  The cats were not keen on the Newmans right away.  In fact, they would pick through the mixture and deposit the Newmans on the floor and continue to eat only the Science Diet until I finally transitioned them over 3 weeks onto only Newmans.<br /><br />The things I've noticed -- they are not eating the same quantity of food.  I have a bowl that sits out all the time and so they are free to eat when they want. I add 1/2 cup increments throughout the day.  They seem to enjoy the food the best when it is first put in the bowl - not wanting to eat the stuff that's been in there for 12 hours or more.  I've been keeping track of their weight as I was worried about weight loss from not eating but they are all the same weight as before.<br /><br />The litter habits have decreased.  The two youngest cats used to use the litter box twice a day but now only once.  I read on Newmans website that  the digestive system can take up to 2-3 months to acclimate itself to the new diet.  The only downfall for this food is the accessibility.  I can easily get it at Whole Foods here in Florida if I'm in a rush (if they have it!) but when I return to my summer home in the middle of nowhere - i'll be forced to order it online.  Just checked today and most places don't have it in stock now.<br /><br />Other things worth mentioning - my cats never had fur balls on the Science Diet.  There have been 3 fur balls in the past 4 weeks with the Newmans.  Also, the cats fur tends to be a little drier than on the S.D.  Other than that, i'm happy for the moment with the Newmans and have recommended it my friends.

review/summary: A little concerned...
review/text: I carefully researched "natural" brands of cat food and decided Newman's had the best ingredient list of all the competitors out there. They didn't have questionable ingredients like Wysong, and some other "natural" companies that I would never buy. I was happy to find an organic cat food and began switching my cats over from a high quality, but not organic, commercial cat food. All of my cats except one seemed to prefer the taste of the Newman's, while the one cat tried to refuse it. So, no real problems there. However, like some other people have mentioned, my cats began to throw up. A lot.<br /><br />I am very concerned about the digestibility of this cat food. My cats are not throwing up hairballs - they are throwing up the food which looks like it hardly broke down, if at all, in their digestive track.<br /><br />Also, you have to feed larger quantities of Newman's to get the same amount of vitamins to your cat that are supplied in smaller servings of brands like Iams. So, don't compare this to another brand pound-for-pound.<br /><br />I have never tried the Newman's canned cat food, but perhaps cats would have an easier time keeping it down.<br /><br />I was very careful in switching my cats over to a new brand, which shouldn't be a health issue if the brand truly IS "high quality," so I have grave concerns about this dry cat food. I was really hoping I had found an organic brand that my cats would eat for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />My cats have never had problems like this before (they are all around 4-years-old) and I feel horrible that I made them sick by trying to give them what I thought would be a healthier food.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this dry food to anyone.

review/text: It's amazing how much better this coffee is from other brands.  The flavor is rich yet mellow. The coffee tastes wonderful and the room smells delightful. Just brewing one pod in the morning starts my day off with pleasant feelings.  One important thing though....the pods are not individually wrapped, so flavor is lost quickly; after several days the coffee develops a stale, bitter flavor.  Keep the pods in a plastic zipper bag and you'll be OK.

With illy pods, I know I will get an excellent cup for less money and the clean-up is fast ... win, win, win.

review/summary: Nothing
review/text: Now you may ask why pay to have H20 packed and shipped half way around the world just to be guzzled in a mater of seconds, minutes at the most?<br /><br />Well "nothing" is the reason. Everyday you hear about the odd stuff that is in local water supplies. My favorite statement is "it may look nasty and taste awful but it is perfectly safe." So we turn to bottled water that is everything from the same local water just packaged to fancy mineral water that needs lime to mellow it out. Included in this category is a concoction called drinking water; they take everything out and put back what they guess makes water drinkable. The worst sort of stuff is items packed in colorful plastic bottles that taste like colorful plastic.<br /><br />Evian on the other hand is water the way that nature intended. It goes down smooth and has no after taste. It is refreshing when cooled but can work well even at room temperature. Gourmet coffee locations use this as the base water because it does not distract from the taste. The water is even used externally for applying and removing makeup. I keep a case in the car incase of any emergency that may come up.<br /><br />There is "nothing" more satisfying.

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: These not only taste great but very satisfying in the midst of a hectic day and no time to eat. Fits easily in your bag, only 280 cals for 2 oz bag and has 6g of fiber. Much healthier and better tasting than anything found in a vending machine. I love them all but Soledad is my fave.

review/summary: BEST SNACK EVER
review/text: Sahale snacks are nutritious, delicious and addictive: low in carbs and sugar so diabetics can enjoy them, and SO much better than typical trail mixes. They have quality ingredients, a wonderful variety of flavors and are the perfect snack for kids and adults.

review/summary: Perfect size!
review/text: These are the perfect size!  The bigger bags you can buy in the grocery stores lead to the temptation of eating the entire bag!  But with these portions, you could eat half the bag for a snack or the entire bag for a meal replacement and not feel bad.  They are actually 2 servings per bag.  They were fresh and delicious when they arrived.

review/summary: love the nuts!
review/text: I found the Sahale snacks while on vacation and fell in love with the unique flavors.  When I got home, I couldn't find them at my local store, so was thrilled to see the sampler pack on Amazon.  We love the small bags - easy to take anywhere and don't sit around long enough to go stale.  The cashew combo is a good sweet snack, while the others give you great flavors and a little spicy hit.  Yum!
