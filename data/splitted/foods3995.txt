review/summary: Icing is HORRIBLE and doesn't even smell good
review/text: Those posting that these cupcakes are amazing must not know what homemade cupcakes and icing are - the cupcakes are not bad - not very attractive as the one posting commented but that is because I actually filled the cupcakes 3/4th full like the box said and they overflowed.  Would have been better had it said to just fill them half way and make more cupcakes.  However, the icing was TERRIBLE!  Actually inedible and I LOVE desserts and sweets and icing and will try anything but it doesn't even smell like good chocolate frosting.  I followed directions precisely, used all fresh ingredients (bought the day I made them) and I ended up using my own homemade icing with the cupcakes rather than throwing the cupcakes and icing away.  And for the amount of work for the cupcakes, I'd rather make some from scratch - they'd definitely taste better.  Very disappointing since I typically love Ina and have had some of her other box mixes which were excellent.

review/summary: Serve with Lipitor
review/text: A neighbor raved about this cupcake mix so I thought I'd make if for my hubby's birthday.  It certainly was easy enough but...the bake time was more than the 20-22 minutes and my cupcakes didn't rise very well.  Old mix?  The buttercream frosting was very sweet and made as directed, did not seem thick enough to stay on the cupcake without sliding off.  The Lipitor advice?  This mix calls for three sticks of butter between the cake and the frosting!!!

review/summary: Best box mix cupcakes I have ever eaten!!!
review/text: I keep a box of these in my pantry almost all the time. The cupcakes are not heavy. They are really good. The frosting is to die for. It is light and chocolately and creamy. Make sure to follow the directions and use unsalted butter. And definately put in the egg yolk in the frosting. I have been doing it for a while and never had a problem. I just use the freshest eggs that I can buy. Note: The mix says it makes 12 but I usually get about 20 out of one mix and there is enough frosting to put tons of it on each one.

review/summary: Charming package, mixed quality tea
review/text: Tea forte design is very delightful: the slender pyramidal tea bag with the pert little green leaf decoration makes that morning cup extra special. I only wish that they would have put as much thought perfecting into their actual teas. The basic black teas (darjeeling, breakfast, etc.) are nice, but the herbal and green teas have an odd artificial flavoring -- like drinking potpourri. The strange aftertaste makes it seem as if they add artificial sugars like sweet and low. I prefer my teas pure usually and also think it's better practice in general to let the tea-drinker decide how much sugar and what kind.

review/summary: Very Tasty!
review/text: That's what I thought when I took the first bite. I found these on an Amazon Manager's Special, for slightly less than $2/box and the ingredients were healthy and intriguing - with the 5 seed combination, and two of my favorites - rosemary and garlic. Since there were no reviews, I didn't really know what to expect, but I had to give these a try.<br /><br />First of all, they are very fresh & crunchy. The "sell by" date is 11/02/09 - 2 months away. They're cute, little, 1.5" round "crackers", really tortilla chips. As a tortilla chip, these are the best I've ever had. They are very sturdy, you could use them to scoop anything, including the thickest guacamole, and I don't think they would break or crumble. The delicious taste I got from the first one with all of the nuances of every flavor, unfortunately diminishes, where the rosemary and garlic isn't really discernible, but you still get that wonderful corn (organic!) & seeds flavor with just the right amount of salt - way lower than most with 50mg. I don't know if that is considered a low sodium product, but many snacks and processed foods, like most jerky and a lot of crackers are way too salty for me.<br /><br />FYI Nutrition info:<br />Serving Size 1oz / about 16 crackers (28g) - 4 servings/box<br />Calories 140<br />Total Fat 7g - Saturated Fat 1g - No Trans Fat<br />Cholesterol 0<br />Total Carbs 18g<br />Fiber 2g<br />Sugars 0<br />Protein 2g<br />Sodium 50g<br /><br />BTW, they are gluten free, which is really important for a lot of people.<br />Most of the crackers in the box I opened were intact with a few broken ones mostly at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />Even though they are perfect on their own, they would be really good with a black bean dip, guacamole or hummus.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you're looking for a tasty and healthy snack cracker/chip, these are for you!

review/summary: Addiction in a small blue and white wrapper
review/text: I grew up with these. They're a total chewy, sweet and salty addiction. You might find yourself eating half a dozen in a row. There's a large seed inside you chew around and spit out. Sometimes you get a pack that's nice and juicy and fresh, sometimes they're a bit hard and small and dried out, depending how long they've been off the boat I suspect, but still pretty good - they vary just like dried fruit varies. I also like the other varieties you can get, preserved lemon peel etc. Sold at most Chinatown type shops.

review/summary: OK, But Texas Has Issued a Recall Due to Lead Levels
review/text: I had eaten about half a bag of these (over the course of several days) before doing a search that happened to include the Food and Drug Administration, where I learned that the Texas Health Department has issued a warning for these specific plums, along with several other brands, out of concern for high lead levels. Here is the link. [...] They are not specific as to lot numbers, but there is no question in my mind that what is listed on Amazon is what is covered by the recall. I'm sending a copy of this review to Amazon and the grocery, and will update as needed.

review/summary: So yummy but....
review/text: Ok, I must admit I am a junkie for these. We ate them as kids in Jamaica (of all places), and they were so good. I just stocked up on 3 bags and I am steadily working my way through the first bag (so addictive), when I just came across the FDA warning dated 2009. Hmmm....must go home and check my label to see if my bag came from one of those companies. This is 2012 so hopefully things are improved. But if you come across these treats and they are FDA approved your taste buds will be very, very happy. I gave the product 4 stars simply because they are so addictive (don't worry, that's just me folks) and because I have to check my bags to see about the FDA warning.

review/summary: Great espresso, pods are a pain.
review/text: First, I should say that this is possibly the best espresso I have ever made at home.  Everything about it makes for the best cup I could wish for.  Having transitioned from Starbucks ESE pods, to Illy, and now this - this espresso taste and experience is by far the best.<br />HOWEVER, every pod I have opened has not been packed tightly enough.  So, the first few times I made this espresso, it was horrible.  When I figured out the issue, I have had to open up every pod, dump it into my basket, tamp it down, and make it.  This, obviously, is completely the opposite point of having the pods.  Having used several other companies' pods, it is easy to see (once I ruined a few initial tries) that these pods are significantly looser than anyone else'.  I will not buy the Bristot pods again, but will instead look for just loose grounds, in a can or bag.<br />GREAT ESPRESSO when it is packed right - would never suggest the pods.

review/summary: pretty but challenging to use
review/text: These made my baked goods look really nice for the holidays, but they were a bit difficult to work with. The stars are tiny, and I mean tiny! The container is simply an open top small diameter vial. In order to get the product spread (somewhat) evenly onto the baked good, I had to tap them out with a fingernail while moving the vial along the baked good. I considered trying to use a tweezer (!), but that would have taken until summer of 2012, so went with the "tap" method. I admit, I can be a bit too AR, so threw symmetry out the window and went for the "scattered" look. Everyone loved the effect, though. Makes your product look really special, especially for the holidays. There are jimmies and sprinkles everywhere, but these add just a bit of extra to things.

But, for the price, they aren't something I'd purchase to use very often. On the plus side...you really get a LOT more in the tube than you'd think...and since they are so small...you can definitely make them last. I thought I'd go through one pack in one big double-batch of cupcakes. I didn't. And I was a very generous sprinkler. Works best on white )or lighter colored) icing...the gold doesn't show up well on chocolate.

For larger spaces to cover I could use my fingers, which went faster.

review/text: I have been addicted to this hot sauce for over 8 years, when I discovered it in Texas. I'm afraid of hot sauces because of the overkill in vinegar. Sontava has perfected a hot sauce to taste like I spicy salsa, the peppers roasted, not burned like other hot sauces I've tasted. I've been to hot sauce comparison taste offs, and still nothing compares to this wonderful blend. I love this hot sauce more than any other hot sauce in the world! It is great on tacos, seafood and my personal favorite is mixed in with Tostitos Queso Dip. Amazing! When I order the boxes, my friends are usually lined up waiting for a bottle. Apparently everyone else around me is addicted too.

review/text: These are fairly good. However, there is very little peanut context to them.It seems like only a little bit of peanut ground up in the center of the snack. I would recommend they rework this product to have a whole or half peanut encased in the yogurt coating.

review/text: I orderd a case when the last grocery store I knew about quit carrying the product.  It is a very good olive spread.  Makes a very tasty and reasonable calorie snack.  However two of the six jars had leaked and the lids were not sucked in.  I called the company and they credited my account immediately.  They get an A for customer service.

review/summary: My cats have never looked better!!
review/text: I never used to think that cat food could change a cat's coat like the Nutro food does! It's freakin phenomenal!! The first thing I noticed was my cats hair got so glossy and shiny! It's soooo soft!! And I used to get tuffs of hair all under my kitchen cabinets near the floor due to all the shedding-- with this food?? I HARDLY have as much lose hair around the house that I used too. I went from vacumming 3 canisters full to only 2 canisters of hair weekly. This food is awesome! It really works and my cats love it. I buy the indoor chicken flavor for adult cats.

review/summary: Nutro makes Sheba nice
review/text: Beautiful Sheba cat loves her Nutro cat food.  Her coat is lustrous and sleek and shiney and her eyes are bright.  She is built solid as a rock and full of pizzazz.  Even though she occassionally lets me feel the tip of her fangs, I know she would sink them into my finger if she wasn't pleased with her diet.  She has her ways of letting me know if she is happy or not and keeps me in line by reminding me that her teeth are never out of range of my hand.  So I know that if I keep feeding her the Nutro that she seems to love, I can avoid most bites.  Therefore I am grateful to Nutro cat food for providing a way for me to avoid being mauled.  As long as I keep the Nutro coming and don't allow her food bowl to get below half full, she and I will both stay alive and her bites will at least not draw blood.  I fear the consequences should I ever be forced to attempt to feed her a different brand.

review/summary: Do not feel safe feeding Nutro
review/text: I no longer feel comfortable buying Nutro for my beloved felines. Shortly after we purchased some indoor Max Cat formula for them, our male cats started vomiting and having diarrhea. We gradually tapered off the Nutro and introduced some new stuff. The cats stopped having problems and were no longer vomiting or having loose stools. A couple months down the road our male cat started peeing in different places and wouldn't go in the litter box. We took him to the vet to find out he had a severe UTI and that this had been going on for 2-3 months. We traced it back to about the time we started feeding him this Nutro Indoor Cat formula. I feel this food is to blame for his severe UTI conditions. Perhaps it's not the only culprit, but considering the awful side effects, it might have been the top contributor.<br /><br />Lots of pet owners are disowning Nutro and switching to something with better quality checks.<br /><br />If you are having problems with Nutro, call the company at 1-800-833-5330 and tell them your claim and what is happening to your pet.<br /><br />Here is a link of pet owners with problems with this cat food :<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I no longer feel safe purchasing any type of Nutro cat food for my beloved pets.

review/text: I received the freshen up gum as indicated. The product arrived on time. The product looked exactly as it was advertised on your web site. There was no misleading information or advertisement at all.<br /><br />It is a very pleasant tasting chewing gum for my entire family. My sole reason for ordering so much is that I can save money by ordering in bulk and the ingredients in the gum are very safe. I grew up as a youngster chewing this gum.  If it was good enough for me then it sure good enough for my family.<br /><br />I will not purchase any edible products that contain any synthetic sugars such as aspartame, nutrisweet, etc. Those ingredients are dangerous to say the least for human consumption.<br /><br />I am so pleased that I will be ordering once again.  We will even be considering ordering other items.

review/text: This is the best olive juice you can find. The juice has a fantastic flavor and is topped off with a signature stuffed olive. I have tried the other brands like Boscoli and they do not compare. You have to use 3 times the amount of juice to equal the flavor of the 3 Bar Picante Olive Juice. Do not pass on this juice because of the Picante, it adds flavor not spiciness which some people dislike. You will be very happy for trying this juice or very sad for passing it up.

review/text: I was most disappointed with this product.  If a taste can be "sticky" that is what it tastes like, nothing at all like brandy. To be fair, I have used brandy extract in coffee for many years (so I know it can work out well) and this really makes it undrinkable. I have not baked with it, but I cannot imagine the taste improving by adding heat to it.  Very disappointed, recommend against it for anyone seeking a brandy taste.

review/summary: Delicious and Easy Meal, happy family
review/text: I am a bzzagent, and I received a can in the mail to test out. I was excited to try the Progresso Recipe Starters Sauce in the flavor of Garlic. This sauce has a chicken broth base and has endless possibilities. I decided to make a chicken breast dish with broccoli and winter butternut squash.<br /><br />I had my husband peel and cut up a large butternut squash and cube into large pieces. Once those were finished, I put them in a large pot with salted and buttered water to cook until very soft. I drained the water out of the pot and used a potato mashed and prepared like home style mashed potatoes. I left some chunks of the squash for a nice texture. I added 2 tbs of Philadelphia cream cheese to the mashed squash (spreadable kind). I taste tested the squash and it was amazing. I turned the burner on low to keep this warm.<br /><br />Now on to the chicken.<br /><br />I started out with a pan with some butter and oil. I butterflied the thawed chicken breast and added some salt and a ground pepper spice seasoning (mixed spices) and one third of the Garlic Cream sauce. I cooked the chicken until it was golden and well marinated in the spices. I added a small serving of steamed broccoli (leftover from the previous day) to the pan to garnish the chicken and add a splash of color. I added about 5 tbs of crushed canned pineapple.<br /><br />When the chicken was finished and had soaked up the delicious flavors of the garlic pineapple sauce and seasonings, I added another 1/3 of the can of sauce to the chicken. (the last 1/3 I was able to save in a air tight container to enjoy the next day--perhaps to use as a base with chicken broth for a soup for lunch.<br /><br />I plated the chicken and poured the garlic pineapple sauce on top. I added some warmed crushed pineapple on top of the chicken breast and added a few pieces of broccoli. I plated the mashed butternut squash.<br /><br />This was a very easy and delicious meal. I served this to my husband and our 19 month old daughter (hers was cut up appropriately as a finger food to prevent choking).<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the garlic sauce, as I am not a fan of garlic. This sauce was delicious and not overpowering with garlic. I would try this again with another recipe/dish in the near future. This particular sauce would be a great base for many soups and a variety of meals. I highly recommend this.

review/summary: a little bit disappointing
review/text: I've ordered beef jerky online several times over the last few years. It's usually overpriced at the store, especially when it comes in 1 to 2 oz. packets. Yes it takes a lot of beef to make beef jerky, but I suspect some of the big players in the industry are making a lot of money.<br /><br />So I try to keep my eye on the smaller outfits which will sell excellent quality jerky for $20 or less per pound. I think my favorite to date has been Tillamook Country Smoker, especially their hot varieties, though jerkyusa is quite good too. I've got a background in jerky which extends beyond what you'll find in the typical grocery or discount store, though I have eaten my share of those brands too.<br /><br />The price on the Golden Valley's Peppered Beef Jerky is excellent, so I figured that I'd give it a shot. I'd say that the two qualities that beef jerky should have are:<br /><br />1)texture (esp. chewability)<br /><br />2)flavor<br /><br />Regarding the texture of this jerky -- this particular batch was not great. Some pieces were better than others, but on average, it was pretty tough. I'd say it's a bit better than the megabrand that you'll find in most grocery stores, but I was expecting a little bit more.<br /><br />The flavor was OK, but nothing special. Overall, I prefer my peppered jerky to have more of a black pepper bite to it - this was definitely on the less seasoned end of the spectrum. In addition, the jerky had a relatively sweet flavor to it that I don't particularly like.<br /><br />I found this particular batch to be relatively average in both texture and flavor. I've decided to give it 3 stars because the price is very reasonable.

review/summary: Not So Good
review/text: This jerky sounded pretty promising.<br /><br />It has a great price, and they use quality beef and no chemicals.<br /><br />When I got it, however, I was very underwhelmed by the flavor.  It was too sweet, and not spicy enough.  Also, when I got done chewing on a bunch of it, I would have a wad of unchewable fatty junk in my mouth which I had to spit out.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-They use quality beef with no growth hormones or antibiotics<br /><br />-None of the chemicals that are in a lot of jerky<br /><br />-Texture was good, but not great<br /><br />-Good price<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Not very spicy<br /><br />-Sugar is the second ingredient, making it way too sweet and not as healthy as it could be.<br /><br />-Beef cuts a little too fatty.<br /><br />I would definitely not buy this flavor again, and I would probably keep looking before considering another bag of Golden Valley Jerky.

review/text: I'm a big fan of almost any mammal jerky, and also of not going to the store.  I ordered this based on the description and it arrived very quickly.  The Good:  It's excellent quality and well packaged.  The Bad:  For me, it was seriously lacking in flavor, and I'd say nearly tasteless.  It had a slightly sweet flavor, but very little salt, brine, or much else in the way of seasonings.  Conclusion:  It's high quality and a decent value.  I'll try a different flavor based on this, but I will not order this flavor again.

review/summary: started well, ended poorly
review/text: I'm not a jerky connoisseur (and can't afford to be). I think the Golden Valley peppered beef jerky strikes a good balance of quality and value. The product looks, smells, and tastes pretty much like beef with some black pepper added to it. No MSG, no artificial flavors. Hours after you've eaten it, you won't feel like something is polluting you. The package has only a small amount of crumbs and small fragments, so it's finger food all the way to the bottom of the bag, not fingers-in-your-mouth food.<br />UPDATE: After a long period of subscribing to the Golden Valley Original 16-ounce packages, I've given up. The quality declined gradually, with pieces becoming smaller and tougher with not much flavor. But the final blow was a sudden decrease to a 12-ounce package -- at the same price. I'll have to find something else.

review/summary: Good stuff, but not super chewy
review/text: I tend to like very chewy jerky.  I'm looking for a lowfat, high-protein snack but if I'm going to add something like jerky to my diet I can't have all the usual chemicals and such.  So, this product is an excellent price and as far as I'm concerned it tastes great, but it's a softer jerky, almost exactly like Pemmican.  Part of the fun with jerky, and why it's such a good snack, as far as I'm concerned, is that it takes awhile to eat it.  THis is easier to eat, but that's not a huge deal, really.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product.  The "consume within 3 days of opening" seems a little odd to me, considering it's a 1 lb. bag.  I keep it in the fridge and it's lasted several weeks without an issue.  Tastes great without all the bad stuff and it doesn't cost an arm & a leg, which is what I was looking for.

review/summary: So good
review/text: I'm not sure why people here review this brand and flavor so poorly here.  A good part of me thinks it's because they're so used to the chemical taste and artificial flavorings of the big brands (MSG laden jerkys, or loaded with flavorings and preservatives).<br /><br />Anyway, back to the jerky...<br /><br />I work out, run, and teach cardio kickbox classes weekly and without lots of serious, natural protein, I will feel it within a few days.  Without exception, every other brand of jerky I've tried either uses MSG or contains so many preservatives I feel sick after eating enough to fit my needs.  Stay away from World Kitchens -- tasty but MSG loaded.<br /><br />So if you're eating real amounts of jerky, give ANY of the Golden Valley jerky products a spin for a few weeks and you'll feel a night and day difference.

review/text: The meat was poor quality. It was very chewy--not tender at all--and many pieces were gristly, so we'd wind up having to spit wads out since no matter how much you chewed, they'd never break up. The taste was okay, but a bit too sweet for our liking.

review/text: I ordered a bag of this when it was first listed as a low carb snack. It was the most tender and tasty jerky I've ever had. So, later I ordered another. That one was okay, but it was more chewy than the first. Overall, I'd say it's good jerky. I just hope if I get a 3rd bag it will be more like the first.

review/text: I didn't like this jerky at all.  I read other reviews and decided to try it.  However, the bag I received was very soft and sweet.  I realize that it's called "sweet" n' spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all.  The sweetness was overpowering.  I prefer at dryer jerky also.  This was so soft that you could bite right through it.  I'm used to jerky that is tougher.<br /><br />I know I'll never purchase this brand again.

review/text: I made a mistake on the other review, I mixed it up with a differnt brand.  I received a bag of this jerky today,  I have just ordered another package.<br />This is the best beef jerky that I have bought off the market  However, the Hi-Country brand from Montana is just as good, only that brand has preservatives.<br />This natural beef jerky, in my opinion, could not be made any better. This jerky has a sweet and a mild spicy flavor with the right amount of bite.<br />The beef has the right chewability.  I like this jerky so much, that it is hard to explain in a written review.  You have to know JERKY to concept,<br />what I am saying.  I would give this product and the company 10 stars if I could.  That should explain it. I ordered this jerky one day and received<br />it the next day.  Order yourself a package, then you will see what I mean.................

review/summary: Excellent quality and price
review/text: Like other reviewers on here, I was looking for beef jerky under $20/lb. I was also quite impressed by this product's claim that it lacks MSG, artificial flavorings, nitrates, and preservatives. I decided to give the sweet n' spicy variety a go, and I was quite impressed despite the lackluster reviews. The texture, I must admit, lacked consistency; some bites were tougher than others. Overall, however, the flavor tasted great and the quality of the beef was apparent. If you're looking for inexpensive, natural beef jerky, you can stop your hunt right here.

review/text: This jerky is the soft, chewy style.  Though it is listed as Sweet'N'Spicy, it's quite a bit more sweet than spicy.  I doubt even the most sensitive to spice would consider this spicy jerky.  It's tasty, it doesn't have any nitrites, MSG, high fructose corn syrup or anything else that's terrible for you.  It's also affordable.  The only reason it didn't get five stars is that it's not an outstanding and amazing, one-of-a-kind flavor worthy of five stars.

review/text: I buy this jerky because it's all-natural. The taste is great but the quality of the meat is just okay. Half the pieces contain what seems like cartilage or tendons or some stringy thing I'd rather not eat and some pieces are ridiculously tough. For the price, it's not really worth it.

review/text: No MSG, no hormones, no antibiotics, makes for a great purchase in my book.  So why only two stars?  Unfortunately, after giving Golden Valley a chance with both this and their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E4ARBE">Sweet N' Spicy</a> flavor I couldn't make myself enjoy the taste.  The texture is strange, it reminds me of chewing cube steak.  You know it's beef but you also know it's a little too chewy to be steak.  It's possible people who like their steak rare may enjoy the chewy texture as it's not too tough as far as beef jerky goes.  Plus, something about the flavorings they use gives the meat a sour, almost rancid taste.  I'm guessing it's the apple cider vinegar as it reminds me of fruit or apple juice that's turning bad. They need to improve their flavors before I try them again.

review/text: If you are into hiking, bike riding or traveling. I don't recomand this beef jerky. First once you open the package, you must keep it refirgerated. The instructions say "for best taste use within 3 days." It is good, it is tender, but again the down fall is keeping it in a refrigerator. You are better off going to your nearest Wal-mart or Target, etc. and pick up one of the brands they carry and forget about refrigerating and eating it in a hurry. I hope this helps some of you from ordering to much like I did, I order 2 lbs, and sorry I did.

review/summary: YUMMY!!!
review/text: Got this for Christmas and was super excited about it. I Baked them just yesterday and man they were yummy! It made about 9 pretzels for us and most of ours ended up really fat, but they still looked and tasted really good. The last step tells you to brush butter on them, but we didn't do this as we figured it would knock off all the salt and would add unnecessary fat.<br /><br />The only thing that you will need to add to this recipe is warm water, vegetable oil (to keep them from sticking to pan/ counter top) and  baking soda. (Also melted butter if you want)<br /><br />These are best eaten when they are still warm. We thought we could use flour on the counter top instead of vegetable oil, but I think the vegetable oil is a much better idea. Without the oil it will be hard to roll the dough into long ropes.<br /><br />There is a part where it tells you to line a bowl with vegetable oil before putting the dough in it to rise. We found that step unnecessary, as we did it without it and the dough didn't stick.

review/summary: My "secret" ingredient!
review/text: Bobs Red Mill Wheat Germ is high quality product (like many other things from Bobs Red mill!) Wheat germ is the flaky center of wheat kernels. It adds slightly earthy flavor. Wheat germ has a very light flavor, it is easy to mix into thing and not even notice it is there. It just adds goodness and fiber. Wheat germ is packed with 23 nutrients, including many essential minerals and more antiaging tocopherols (a type of E vitamin) than any other plant. Two tablespoons supply about 12 percent of your daily value of folate, the B vitamin believed to protect against colon cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and dementia.<br /><br />I have many uses for what germ from sprinkling it on my morning cereal to using in baking.<br /><br />My most fun use of it in my famous chicken salad. I use wheat germ as my "secret" ingredient in a chicken salad dressing: 1 Tbsp. wheat germ, 1 Tbsp. curry powder, 1 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. mustard powder, and 1 cup nonfat Greek yogurt. If often bring this dish to a "pot luck" outings, and people really enjoy it. For fun I mention I use a secret ingredient but often don't disclose it :-)<br /><br />Wheat germ is easy to spill from the plastic bag it arrives in, so when I am ready to use a new bag I pour the content of the bag into a plastic container designed for cereal, this allows me to pour the kernels out of the container's spout without spilling the them on the counter. To make it easier to move the content of the bag into the container, I cut a small hole in the bag and use a funnel to direct the content into the container.<br /><br />In case you find it useful here is a taste comparison of other seeds I use in my diet.<br /><br />FLAXSEEDS<br />Nutty-flavored seeds that provide the most nutrition when ground.<br /><br />HEMP SEEDS<br />Similar in taste to sunflower seeds and pine nuts.<br /><br />BUCKWHEAT GROATS<br />Soft seeds with a sweet, earthy flavor when toasted.<br /><br />WHEAT GERM<br />The flaky center of wheat kernels.

review/summary: Tastes substantially better than Bob's Red Mill Wheat Bran
review/text: Bob's Red Mill Wheat Germ, which is delicious, tastes substantially better than Bob's Red Mill Wheat Bran, which has only an acceptable taste.  Wheat germ is richer in vitamins, minerals, and short-chain omega-3 fatty acids than wheat bran.  However, wheat bran is richer in insoluble fiber and also in cancer-preventing antioxidants such as p-coumaric acid.  Also, wheat bran has only about half of the calories of an equal amount of wheat germ.  The human body is usually able to convert only about 5% of the short-chain omega-3 fatty acids in our food into phospholipid-based long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, which is what the human body really needs.  Soluble fiber, which is plentiful in psyllium husk capsules, works extremely well for preventing and treating constipation.  Insoluble fiber, which is plentiful in wheat bran, flaxseeds, and vegetables, is only slightly helpful against constipation.  Both soluble and insoluble fiber contain cancer-preventing antioxidants (please click "Comment" below).

review/text: I love the Just Cheese bars. It's basically just crisped cheese, some of which have powdered flavoring mixed in. This one is jalepeno, which is my favorite. In fact it's the only flavor my wife & I can agree on (I also really like the Pizza flavor, but my wife hates them). Just goes to show you how different individual tastes vary.<br /><br />But I do have mixed feelings about Just the Cheese - it's a genius idea. A convenient, single-serving bar of crispy cheese, to throw in your bag or glove box for a low carb snack. But 3 problems:<br /><br />(1) Too much sodium. I have to guzzle a glass of water after eating a bar. And these are only 1/2 ounce!<br /><br />(2) Taste isn't always consistent. Sometimes you get a burned piece.<br /><br />(2) The price (over $1 per bar) is really too high for 1/2 ounce of cheese.  The Atkins & South Beach bars are much cheaper - usually 2.7-3.5 ounces (nearly 5-7 times more) for about the same price. I do not think this product should cost SIX TIMES what an Atkins bar costs.<br /><br />These bars get a 3.5 stars for me. If the company would fix these problems, I'd give it a 5.<br /><br />PS - If you like the idea of zero carb cheese snacks, you can easily make these yourself at home in just a few minutes:<br /><br />Put a little oil (or Pam) on aluminum foil, sprinkle on some shredded hard cheese from the bag (Parmesan is the easiest and most widely available), and bake it in an oven for 5-10 minutes until it turns golden brown. A great serving size is 20-30 half-dollar sized parmesan bites/crisps, on a normal sized baking pan. A toaster oven or convection oven is best - it makes fewer servings, but will crisp faster (3-4 minutes on 400-450). And the great thing is, if you're a low carber who misses chips & dip, your homemade cheese crisps are easily dip-able in salsa, sour cream, etc.

review/summary: Tastes burnt!
review/text: This cheese is baked until crunchy and is a low carb, low calorie snack.  It tastes burnt and is extremely crunchy, like tooth breaking crunchy.  I will not buy it again.

review/summary: I Thought they were yummy
review/text: I saw two bad reviews, and just wanted to let people know that I liked them and have ordered a second box of them.  Tasty alternative to chips.

review/summary: Edible...that's about it.
review/text: Bars are evidently healthly...containing a decent amount of protein and calcium. However, the taste leaves something to be desired. They do not taste good; yet, they are palatable.

review/summary: Eh, a little too weird for me
review/text: I really do like the little bags of snacks from this company, but the bars are too weird. They are basically the same, but shaped like a bar. But it's not the same as popping a disc into your mouth and snacking on it like a chip or something. I'm not really sure what this one was trying to emulate. Maybe a granola bar?<br /><br />I dunno, the taste was similar to me, but it was... weird.<br /><br />They are also (like the snack bite things) very salty).<br /><br />I'd stick to things like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EML7DS">Just the Cheese Mini Round Snacks, Classic White Cheddar, 0.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 16)</a> if you want a crunch - or look for their lower salt versions if you are watching sodium.
