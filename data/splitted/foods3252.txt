review/summary: Delicious, with a catch...
review/text: I love these things. Eating one of these bars is highly reminiscent of snarfing down a handful of those super-sweet wafer cookies in all their unhealthy, refined yumminess. The only problem? Despite the 14gr of protein, I find these bars utterly unsatisfying. As someone who needs to make sure every calorie counts bigtime, I can't afford to eat a protein bar that won't carry me over to the next mealtime. Unfortunately, I can (and have) devoured more than one of these at a time in a single sitting. I believe I purchased a single bar in the grocery store recently as a "treat", but I can never buy a whole box of these bars ever again. These taste great, no question (though I do detect the "protein" aftertaste), just don't get them if you shouldn't be cramming them down your throat two at a time. Unless, of course, you have more self control than I do.

review/text: I have tried all of the flavors and have to say that chocolate is my least favorite. However, the vanilla, pb creme, and wild berry are all awesome.  The wild berry is almost like a strawberry birthday cake made into a wafer bar.  There is a pb fudge that is just ok. They should sell a variety box!  Also, get these shipped in cooler months. And I recommend storing in freezer. :)  And i forgot the cookies n creme.... Also delicious!

review/summary: Quality Energy Bar!
review/text: I've tried these a couple times now, and first of all, they are delicious for an energy bar. Second, I've eaten them before and during workouts and I really do notice a difference in my energy level and stamina. There's no stimulants in it, as far as I can tell - and I don't feel a caffiene buzz or anything, I just notice myself motivated to keep going at times when before I definitely would have stopped. It's really fascinating! Plus, I didn't feel any gnawing hunger to consume high energy (meat, cheese, etc.) stuff at the end of the workout like usual. I'm a skeptic when it comes to different health fads and supplements and stuff, and this looked sorta like one of those that looked fancy but just were a waste of money. But after this second time of trying one right before a workout, I'm convinced this is quality stuff, and I just bought 2 dozen more!

review/text: I love these bars. They're low in carbs 3-4% per bar, light texure, and great taste. I especially like the triple chocolate or peanut butter fudge flavors. The berry flavor has a slight after taste and I wasn't a fan of the peanut butter flavor. These are great if you're watching carb intake and they make a guilt free quick snack.

review/summary: Soy-less protein bars that taste good...
review/text: I was looking for some protein bars that taste good and were soyless. These come close (soy lethicin is still listed).<br />Warning: don't order in warm climate/weather as the chocolate coating melts, even in your hands from holding it.<br />The stevia (sweetener) has a noticeable aftertaste that needs getting used to.<br />I still need to find a substitute protein bar that is good for you, not made of soy and tastes good.<br />I have to say, other than the above, these are light and crispy.

review/text: This is a great snack bar.  But don't expect normal chocolate taste.  It's different.  Not horrible, but different.  After the first bite and you kinda adjust it's fine.  I think the vanilla one is a little more of a real taste.  But the bar itself is great- I love the low sugar- definitely the best low sugar chocolate protein bar I have tasted.

I go through 3 boxes in less than 1 month.  Any tips?!!

review/text: These are the best tasting protein bars i've ever eaten. the taste sweet but only have 5 grams of sugar. they don't have that bad chemically tasting sweetness that alot of low sugar foods have.  they only have 200 calories whereas most of the protein bars i've tried have over 300 calories.  i've been trying to lose weight and starting eat one of these bars a day to try and keep myself from eating candy bars. they definitly satisfy my craving for sweets. i've lost 4 lbs in the past few weeks so at least i know they aren't preventing me from losing weight like my daily candy bar fix was.  also the carb amount is fairly low in these bars. i'm hooked on them and will plan to keep buying them in bulk.

review/summary: Guilt-free and delicious
review/text: Most protein bars are either loaded with sugar (and if you are in the market for protein bars, you probably don't want tons of simple carbs) or sugar alcohols (which are an excellent laxative! it does let manufacturers say say 'low sugar' on the packaging though), have a strange taste to them, and honestly aren't as good as a source of protein as they may appear -- most contain Soy protein.<br />They also tend to have a texture that isn't very appetizing, either really chewey or really gooey.<br /><br />The main difference with these bars is that they taste amazing. They taste what they look like - a giant chocolate wafer, have very little sugar and no sugar alcohols either. They have a pure whey protein source, no soy protein in these (I always read the packaging on protein bars and sadly soy protein is very common). Nutritionally they are not too bad at all, they are definitely great for a pre-workout treat. They are fairly high in fat, very low in carbs, and middle of the road protein (for a protein bar).  But the fact that it has 0 sugar alcohol, very low sugar, whey protein instead of soy and taste delicious really does make up for the higher fat content.<br /><br />Now it isn't really a downside but they are dry and make your mouth water a ton - make sure you have something to drink with them. But really these are my favorite protein/energy bars out there.

review/summary: It's like a cookie . . . with protein!  Yum, yum, yum.
review/text: I stumbled upon these quite by accident: a co-worker left them in the kitchen (people often bring in leftovers or things to share).  I read the package and mused "Creme filled wafer bar?  Intriguing."  I'd never heard the words "wafer" and "protein" used in the same sentence.  But I remembered how much I used to love going to my grandma's house as a kid because she used to keep vanilla, chocolate and strawberry wafer cookies in the cookie jar.<br /><br />These tasty, light crunchy wafers do remind me of those wafer cookies from my childhood.  The peanut butter ones are sweetened with fructose and stevia.  Stevia is a natural swetener with a sightly unusual taste that might be jarring if you're not used it.  It's sweet, but doesn't taste quite like sugar, which is what I like about it.  These bars are just sweet enough to be enjoyable, but not sweet enough that I would want to devour a whole box of them like I would a candy bar.<br /><br />They are light and crispy, and perfect as a snack or a treat.  They're only 10 grams of carbs and 5 grams of sugar [just over a teaspoon] - perfect if you're watching your carbs and want a sweet[ish] snack.  I brought the chocolate one with me to the movies the other night, and while other people had their candy, I had my own "candy" to enjoy, without the suagr high and with the benefit of 13 g of portein.  I can't see a big, buff muscley guy getting a lot out of them [men need more calories & protein], but for me, they are the perfect addition to my health and fitness plan.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change [for nutritional purposes] would be to add more fiber.  But I suppose adding that would affect the texture and possibly the taste.

review/summary: My Doctor suggested these
review/text: So far I have only tried the Vanilla and Chocolate and they were both excellent! These bars were suggested by one of the top weight loss Doctors in the country. Combining these bars for breakfast, having a protein and vegetable for lunch and a protein and vegetable for dinner and sugar free jello or sugar free pudding .for dessert I have lost 14 pounds in 4 weeks and I don't have much more to lose!<br /><br />My Doctor told me that you must multiply the grams of protein in this bar times 2.5 to get the true grams of protein, since the protein used in these bars are di- and tri- peptides, and you absorb 2.5 more of the actual protein than in a regular protein meal. Therefore the true protein grams are:<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cream: 32.5g Protein<br />Peanut Butter Fudge: 32.5g Protein<br />Triple Chocolate: 32.5g Protein<br />Cookies & Cream: 35g Protein<br />Vanilla Cream: 35g Protein<br />Wild Berry Cream: 35g Protein

review/text: Gave the vanilla cookie to my husband who is a diabetic. He has been missing the sweet baked goods he used to be able to eat. He said this tasted like a cookie. The carb count is good but the fat content is high so we only use this as a treat when he really needs something sweet and other low carb food is not satisfying him. Highly recommend it in moderation. We want to try some of the other flavors now.

review/text: I am recovering from pretty extensive GI surgery, so while I need a lot of protein, I have to be careful about what I eat to get it. I am on a bland diet and sensitive to many things right now, so I was having a hard time figuring out new things to eat during the day that are still somewhat healthy.<br /><br />I researched protein bars for days and all of them had either tons of sugar alcohols or were loaded with nuts or fiber. I needed one that would be easily digestible. I was SO glad when I found these but I only purchased one because I was still skeptical. Needless to say, here I am on Amazon buying them by the box.<br /><br />These bars are light, easy to digest, don't sit in your stomach like a brick, and one bar in the morning will curb your hunger until you're ready for lunch. I appreciate that they have 3 new bars that are sucralose free. I just wish they had more flavors!!!

review/summary: I Have To Admit This Chili Is Seriously Delicious
review/text: Bottom-Line: It's what for lunch every day.<br /><br />As I stated in my review of Campbell's Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta soup, I am a family man with the normal trappings of American society; i.e. a mortgage, car payment, insurance payments, children in school, medical bills, grocery bills, well you get the picture.  I am therefore frugal by design, because I do like to save a little of what I make.  That means that I rarely buy my lunch in the company-sponsored cafeteria, or at a local (sit down or take-out) restaurant.  I bring my lunch to work every day sometimes in the guise of "Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili" in an 18.6 oz can or 18.8 oz microwave bowl.<br /><br />The soup brand, whose tag line used to be "so thick you could eat it with a fork, but bring a spoon because you'll want to get every drop,"  is actually quite tasty, much more so than Progresso Soup, which I find (very) bland in comparison.  And Campbell's Chunky Soup is good for you; most of the varieties have vegetables and lean cuts of meat, and are low in fat and contain at least 2 grams of dietary fiber, but "Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili" contains a whopping 8 grams per serving.<br /><br />"Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili" has 230 calories and a still low 8 grams of fat per serving.  Loaded with generous portions of both beef and kidney beans this hearty bowl is enough to satisfy me for a few hours and the average cost is only $1.59 per microwave bowl at my local Target Super Store.  How is that for an inexpensive lunch?  However, my local Target and Jewel does not carry all of the varieties of this delicious chili, but enough so that I can partake in at least four times a month in a different flavor.<br /><br />Other varieties Campbell's offers include Firehouse Chili, Sizzlin' Steak, Tantalizin' Turkey, and Hold The Beans Chili.<br /><br />Nutritional Information<br /><br />Ingredients: water, tomato puree, seasoned beef crumbles, diced tomatoes, red kidney beans, kidney beans, contains less than 2% of the following: red peppers, green peppers jalapeno peppers, dehydrated onions, salt, sugar, dehydrated garlic, paprika.<br /><br />Servicing information: One serving (1 Cup) of "Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili" contains 230 Calories, 8 grams of fat (including 3.5 grams of saturated fat), 30mg of Cholesterol, 870mg of Sodium, 25 grams of carbohydrates, 8 grams of dietary fiber, 11 grams of sugar, and 15 grams of protein.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />There is always plenty of Campbell's Chucky Soup in the pantry at my house.  It is by-and-large the only kind I buy and "Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili" figures highly on my shopping list each week, even my wife likes it and she is a finicky eater.  Low in calories and fat, "Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili" is a tasty alternative to burger and fries, and even a sandwich.  And most importantly if fills me up until my mid-afternoon snake.  Yes, the chili is a little higher in calories than other soups in the chunky line line-up, but hey a guy has to live a little; no worries.

(Sorry, I haven't let a can sit around for more than a month to test that.)<br /><br />UPDATE: Several years later now, this chili has become the core of my emergency food supply. I've also expanded into storing the spicier variation as well (too hot for my wife, perfect for me). And over the years we've been cycling through our supply, I've never once had an urge to check the date because it tasted off. It is holding up it's flavor exactly as promised on the stamped expiration date.

review/text: I read this thread with interest.  I am a long time chilli lover and in fact bet my first chilli experience was via Campbell's Soups.  They certainly have the distribution no others can claim! I won't disagree with the quality of their product - especially on the nutritional side of things - it is worthy of anyone's survival kit.<br /><br />I make kick ass chilli from scratch so I have a palette for this staple in my kitchen. But if you are not inclined to spend the 90 minutes my home made process takes, here's a tip:  Go to Trader Joe's and grab a can of their Beef Chilli.  I have combined TJ's Beef Chilli over one of TJ's frozen Green Chilli & Cheese tamales, steamed on the stove for 25 minutes and then smothered with the heated Beef Chilli.<br />I diced up some green bell pepper to give it a little crunch, but this is a great taste treat.  Fantastic!<br /><br />TJ's is often high on the sodium content, and in this case they are over the top, (37% MDR!) but since I do not load salt on everything and do not generally consume more than 1800 calories a day on the plate, i figure I'm safe.  Doctor it up a little and you're cooking with gas! Highly recommended.<br /><br />ms

review/summary: Great Canned Chili for the Price
review/text: Though Campbell's is more known for their soups, honestly, this has quickly become one of my favorite products of theirs. While nothing beats making chili from scratch, this is the closest canned chili I've found to my homemade stuff, so it's great when I want a quick fix of chili without much hassle.<br /><br />The mix is nice and hearty, with one can being enough for a filling meal, especially if you serve it over rice. Putting a bit of shredded cheese on top is quite tasty as well. It has a slight kick, but nothing that most people won't be able to handle, and you can always get some chili powder at the grocery store if you want to crank it up a notch.<br /><br />Obviously don't expect an inexpensive can of chili to be anything mindblowing, but, for the price, you'll be hard pressed to find anything tastier.

review/text: It's not as good as Wolf's, and I won't be buying it again. However, I once had a can of Campbell's chili and beans that I liked very much. Could it be that it's another type that is not being sold by Amazon? That's possible, because I have sometimes rushed to Amazon to reorder something that I had bought in my local supermarket only to find that it wasn't here. So my search for the perfect chili  goes on. Wolf's, as I have mentioned, is pretty good, but it just lacks sufficient hotness, as does this type of Campbell's chili. I've tried to blend in chili powder, but that tends to make the beans too mushy. Sigh. Anyway, it will be no kind of ordeal to finish my remaining ten cans; in fact, I might eventually develop a real liking for the stuff, because it seems to be the kind of thing that grows on you. Anyone have an idea of how to make canned chili hotter without spoiling its consistency and texture?

review/text: I must admit that this one is very close to Bush's Homestyle Chili, (my fave) but it has been discontinued.  And you could get it in 2 sizes of glass jars, which I prefer.  That being said, I just had a can of this one and I'm in chili city.  I prefer my chili HOT, so in goes powdered habanero pepper.  The meat is lean and tender, the beans not mushy, and the sauce...killer!  But it DID need the pepper.  I usually don't put chili over rice, but my wife used to make a cold garden salad with most all the vegies in it.  Then pour a heated can of chili over it.  Don't knock it if you haven't tried it.  You get the greens WITH the gas.  I'm set to try all the other chili styles Campbell's makes (I've already ordered them from here) and hope they're equally as tasty.  If not, there are many food banks that are in desperate need of canned goods.  BTW, one writer mentioned the salt problem.  I found nothing like that with this style.  But I have had a similar experience with some other canned products.  Very seldom.  So I can empathize with the writer.  All that said, this is now my fave because I haven't received the other ones yet.

review/text: Not only is this Chili the most delicious canned chili I've ever had (speaking of the Campbell's Chunky brand in general), it's perfect for use in various quick and easy "recipes" since heating it up takes just moments versus the time involved in making homemade chili from scratch.  The Roadhouse isn't "hot" spicy, but it is very hearty and has a zing due to the great spices included.  If you add a little extra chili powder, you can adjust the flavor a bit (again) without the hassle of making chili from scratch when you only have a few minutes to begin with.

review/summary: Normal chocolate
review/text: I won one of these in a raffle at my school.<br />It's a lot of chocolate. The reason I did take off one star is because in order for it to not melt you need to freeze it and its rather insane to break apart when its frozen. Impossible to bite into, very hard to cut with a steak knife and pizza cutter, I haven't tried a hammer yet but I have tried other heavy things. It just wont break.

review/summary: Mandarin orange
review/text: I am a soda conniseur and I like to try new sodas all the time. This is a mandarin orange flavored soda from Mexico that is commonly sold in mexican groceries and bakeries in the U.S., one of the 10 or so different varieties from the Jarritos company. It tastes different than most orange sodas, as madarin orange does not taste like other oranges. The sugar tastes more authentic and light as they use the more expensive cane sugar instead of the cheap frutose sweetener most soda companies use on us now. The carbonation is a bit lighter as well and not overpowering.<br /><br />Jarritos is now the best selling Mexican soft drink brand in the U.S. This offer is for a single serving, but they sell other sizes and volumes at Amazon.

review/summary: When good Customer Service tasted better than chocolate...
review/text: Let's cut to the chase. The chocolates I ordered as a gift to my daughter arrived melted. Maybe I should have thought about that possibility, but I subconsciously relied on the vendor's experience. I can't believe that this is a common occurrence, or this vendor would be out of business. So I chalked it up to my own bad luck - which is the only kind I have.<br /><br />So while I was upset about my daughter's experience and reported the matter, the vendor stepped up and offered to ship a replacement package with a cool pack or refund my charge. I know of no better way to build a relationship than to repair an issue. My daughter loves chocolate, as do I, but the experience I had with this vendor left a taste in my mouth that was sweeter than chocolate.<br /><br />I am determined to do business with this organization again.

review/text: Purchased this pasta online after seeing it in a gift shop at a winery in Napa.  I was throwing a wedding shower for friend's of mine and knew this would be the perfect pasta since the bride's colors were black, white, and red.  I cooked the pasta according to the directions on the package and it turned out fantastic!  All of my guests were impressed (with the taste and look of the pasta) and a homemade red sauce made the dish perfect!!  Amazon was the only place I could find this type of pasta - thank you Amazon.com!!!

review/summary: Good fudge, but bad packaging and shipping.
review/text: The fudge is exellent and creamy, and I'd buy the product again. It has a good flavor and you can tell good ingredients were used; the hazelnuts topped it off with an enjoyable flavor - would be great with coffee. However, it arrived half-melted and in a crinkled and badly handled yellow envelope! I opened it and the box it comes in was partly crushed and the plastic dish the fudge was in was cracked and broken on the sides and I had to pick a chunk of plastic out of the fudge! I am unsure how much of this was the seller's fault and how much UPS' fault, but I am highly displeased with that aspect of the purchase. Idealy, I would think fudge that's in a thin paper box with a plastic dish in it, would go in a well-packed small box, rather than an envelope. You'd think someone had intentionally thrown it against a hard surface multiple times by the looks of it. So, all in all, fudge good, the rest is awful. I gave this 3 stars because of this. Had it of arrived in a half-way decent condition, it'd be 5 stars.

review/summary: Sugar-Free Gumballs
review/text: These gumballs are colorful, and a nice size to go in a gumball bank Santa brought my daughter for Christmas.  I like that they are sugarless, but the reason for the 3 stars is because though they taste sweet at first, the sweetness and flavor only lasts a minute at most.  Every sugar-free gum and bubble gum I have ever bought no matter the brand, the sweetness/flavor lasted much longer than regular sugared gums.  As soon as one of these gumballs is chewed up you want to spit it out because it no longer tastes good.  I just think that for the cost, the gum's flavor could have been developed to last much longer.  I must say though that they look very colorful in the gumball machine and looking at them makes you want to chew one.

review/summary: false description
review/text: The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs. This is a lie- when you recieve this product there are only 114 servings in a bag and the serving size is considered 2 gumballs- this is a total of only 228 gumballs. To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description. Hard to write a good review when I feel a little ripped off. When purchasing online all we have to go by are the descriptions - if they are not accurate what can we base our purchase on?

review/summary: Multicolored, but not multiflavored
review/text: I bought a Jr Carousel gumball machine for my fiance's birthday, and with it 3 pounds of .6 inch sugar-free gumballs. The Jr Carousel Gumball machine is nice, but I am here to review the gumballs. They seem to be lacking in the flavor department, and are also pricey. Yes, they are very sweet, but they don't have very much in terms of actual flavor. All you get is the artificial sweetness. The intense taste does not last long, but this is true with all gumballs, sugar free or not. Most commercial gumballs are brightly colored and each color gumball has a different flavor; the surprise of getting a different flavor experience every time is part of the allure of putting quarters into the gumball machine. Not so with the Carousel Sugarfree gumballs: while the Carousel sugar free gumballs contain a variety of bright colors, I have yet to detect any difference in flavor between say a pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or white gumball. No assorted fruits or mints, the only flavor present in these gumballs is simply the sugar-free sweet. While they do taste good, they lose their flavor quickly and get a little boring after a while.
