review/summary: Good Peanut Butter - Not as Pictured
review/text: I like this peanut butter... its not the jar pictured, I received a 6 pack of the Rich Roast - which is what I really wanted anyway but we can't find this brand in the store.<br /><br />And FWIW - there is only 6 months on the 'best if used by' date. Not that I am too concerned. 4 stars only because the picture is wrong.

review/summary: the top choice in our home
review/text: We've tried so many different brands of peanut butter in our home in recent years, from store & national brands to all of the natural/organic varieties available these days, but we've settled on our top choice: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M22TA4">Smart Balance Omega Natural Peanut Butter, Creamy, 16-Ounce Jar (Pack of 6)</a>. It has a very hearty peanut flavor & contains no trans-fats, hydrogenated oils or refined sugar ( it is very lightly sweetened with a bit of molasses.) It is low in impact carbs and even has a bit of dietary fiber for good measure. Another great nutritional bonus is the fact this peanut butter has 1000mg of Omega-3 fatty acids per serving, making <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M22TA4">Smart Balance Omega Natural Peanut Butter, Creamy, 16-Ounce Jar (Pack of 6)</a> a great source of one of the good fats essential to optimal health. For all the great taste & nutrtional value, you couldn't make a better choice than Smart Balance Omega Natural Peanut Butter. Defintely worth a try!

review/summary: Good, but no cure for clogged arteries
review/text: I bought a case when the price was about $18; the price I see as I write this review ($49.95) is way too high. This is basically good peanut butter with some healthy qualities.  While it doesn't contain artificially hyrdogenated oils or trans fats it does contain palm oil, a highly saturated natural fat which keeps it from separating at room temperature.  It's also blended with flaxseed oil, which is high in beneficial omega-3 fatty acids but also contains a significant portion of the less desirable omega-6's. Smart Balance is better than the big commercial brands with hyrdogenated oils, but peanut butter is a high-fat food however you spread it, and should be eaten with that in mind. If you can't live without peanut butter and don't like to stir up jars of the natural kind, this is a good choice (when the price is reasonable).

review/text: Great tasting product from Smart Balance. I eat it regularly along with alomonds purchased from Amazon. This is a great source of essential fatty acids without the hydrogenated oil. Some minor stirring is required as is the case with all-natural nut butters. Fast shipping, even to an FPO/AP address. I will purchase more, I'm sure.

review/summary: Rich Roast instead
review/text: Could be it was just a shipping mistake, but the stuff I got is labeled as Smart Balance All Natural Rich Roast -- and has basically the same sugar content as any normal major brand of peanut butter. Sure, the sugar comes from evaporated cane juice instead of good old-fashioned sugar, but I'm not entirely convinced snooty sugar will somehow be more friendly to my system than nasty-old purified sucrose.<br /><br />I must admit, as well, to being continually frustrated at the lack of a sugar-free brand. I remember, briefly, when one of the major labels put out a sugar-free peanut butter sweetened with splenda, or some other sweetener, but in spite of the fact that there are eleven gazillion different flavors & styles of peanut butter on the shelves, that one vanished almost instantly. I don't know if the health crowd howled because they seem to hate artificial sweeteners almost as much as sugar, but I really wish someone would make a peanut butter that ditched sugar for a non-nutritive sweetener. And it seems odd that nobody is interested in filling that niche.<br /><br />I was going to give one star, but since I know this may have simply been a shipping error, I bumped it up to three. Part of that low rating is that, in spite of having the same sugar levels as regular peanut butter, and added oil, this smart balance peanut butter I received (the rich roast) is kinda, well, awful. It tastes burnt, not rich, and isn't anywhere near as tasty as your major label brands.

review/summary: Great peanut butter if you like fish butter taste.
review/text: My toast ended up tasting like cod liver oil and jelly and not peanut butter and jelly. I bought the Smart Balance stuff because it was on sale and was quite disappointed -- it's like eating fermented kelp boiled in fish oil and topped with kipper snacks. Neither my wife or my son could stomach it. The added Omega bits destroy the flavor.<br /><br />If you want peanut butter, get peanut butter. If you want omega 3, get flax or fish oil. This product is a fail.

review/summary: Not What They Used To Be
review/text: David used to make the best sunflower seeds, but after being bought out by a conglomerate or two (now owned by ConAgra) they are now mediocre at best.  I keep hoping to try the Jumbo variety, thinking they might be better, but they don't seem to be available.  The "Original Flavor" is now not as nutty and fresh as in the past, and the seeds seem smaller.  I wish ConAgra would take a cue from Pepsi and make a "Throwback" variety that would be the real "Original Flavor."

review/summary: A great healthy snack for the family
review/text: Sunflower seeds are a great snack from ages 6 and up. I wouldn't let any child under the age of six to eat sunflower seeds because there is a threat of choking if little kids get these in their mouths. Sunflower seeds are a great healthy snack to snack on from time to time. There are many flavors that David has came out with over the past years. Some of them are Barbeque, Ranch, Nacho Cheese, Jalepino, and their most recent Dill Pickle. Many people that I know love the barbeque flavor but my favorite flavors are original and ranch. They are great to snack on at any sporting event or outside attraction. A very great snack to munch on, I really love sunflower seeds. I almost eat them daily.<br /><br />Fun Fact: I learned in human anatomy class that sunflower seeds clean out your internal systems such as your stomach and intestines so thats always a good thing. Just a fun fact, haha.<br /><br />You can find sunflower seeds at any grocery store, gas station, or at any baseball parks. A very good and healthy snack.

review/text: My family and friends so enjoy the Raspberry Chipotle Sauce over cream cheese with tortilla chips.  It is also good with crackers.  Actually, some of us like the sauce with no cream cheese.  It may seem that the bottle is a bit large, but we have found the contents go fast and it isn't too much.  I recommend this for a quick always ready snack as well as for cooking.  The bottle comes little recipe booklet for ideas on enhancing meats and other food using the raspberry Chipotle sauce.

review/summary: A great tasting sauce with unlimited menu options!
review/text: Whether you're preparing an appetizer, side dish, main course or dessert Fischer & Wieser Razzpotle Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce is a wonderful item to have on hand.<br /><br />I originally ordered this without realizing that it did contain seeds.  Unfortunately I am the type that buys seedless jams, so I was definitely worried that I wouldn't like it.  Upon receiving my order, it looked as though it was a very minimal amount so I decided to give it a try.  Wanting to use recipes that have been tested with this sauce I headed to the Fischer & Wieser website.  There I found three different ones that looked good and would allow me to taste the range of possibilities for this particular sauce.<br /><br />My first choice was raspberry creamed chicken for dinner and it was delicious! The flavor was very nice and I think the cream toned down some of the chipotle's heat which my son wouldn't have normally liked.  Then for dessert we decided to go easy and drizzle some onto vanilla ice cream.  Simple, but tasty when combined together.  The other recipe I will try soon is the raspberry chipotle cheese ball.  It's a take on the sauce poured over cream cheese that everyone has mentioned, but this mixes both together and then you roll it in nuts.  I'm taking it to a super bowl party and hope that it'll be an instant hit.<br /><br />Overall this is a very versatile sauce that I will continue stocking in my pantry.  At first the price seemed a bit high, but when I thought about the price of fresh raspberries I changed my mind. The only thing keeping me from giving this sauce 5 stars would be those seeds!  Although they didn't bother me enough to keep me from eating it, it was enough to say there is room for improvement in my opinion.

review/summary: Tangy sauce with a bit of a kick - great for pork marinades
review/text: The Fischer & Wieser Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce really is your basic delicious marinade, especially for pork chops. They even include a good recipe for pork tenderloin on the attached bottle tag.<br /><br />But the product doesn't stop there - it's amazingly versatile, and here are some of the ways that we have used it.<br /><br />Salad Dressing - mix this product with some sour cream, wine vinegar, give it a really good shake and you've got a creamy and tangy sauce for your grilled chicken salad. This dressing can also be used in a wrap.<br /><br />Cream Cheese and Crackers - you'll also see this recipe on the bottle tag, and so we tried it and it's great. Mix a block of cream cheese with the sauce and smear it on some crackers - you can even pair it with a light creamy cheese for an extra punch.<br /><br />Regardless of how you use it, you'll get a fresh taste of raspberry and a gentle kick of chipotle pepper in this sauce (which also contains Jalapeno as well). Any time you want to tame it down, use some sour cream and you'll be just fine.<br /><br />I only gave the product 4 stars because of sugar being the first ingredient. I'm a big fan of using the natural sweetness from the fruit for things like this, so I wish the sugar content was lower (it's 9g/serving). I do, however, like that there are no preservatives in the product.<br /><br />Contains: Sugar, Red Raspberries, Jalapenos, Apple Cider Vinegar, Water, Pectin, Chipotle, Garlic, Salt, Spices, Natural Smoke Flavor.<br /><br />Enjoy!

I've also tried it on turkey sandwiches and in tuna fish sandwiches, just plain as a dip for bread. It is sweet and fruity, like a raspberry jam but thinner, and is very mild.<br /><br />I don't feel any heat at all when used in combination with other foods. When eaten straight out of the bottle, there is a slight kick. This is not a sauce for those looking for a very hot sauce nor is it for those whose tongue only favors the bland. If you are meat and potatoes, this is not for you. For the majority who are in between folks, I can say this sauce is the hit of every party.

review/text: Except for my wife but somehow, she stays sweet by consistently refusing to ingest anything sweet and THIS Chipotle is sweet (because of the raspberries) in a smoked and mildly hot, perfectly balanced smooth way, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />I had the Chipotle tonite on rice, then on cheese, then on some more rice. I had it yesterday on my omelette. I am planning to try it out tomorrow with tacos... To make a potentially long story short, the Chipotle goes well with just about anything that would take sauce for a flavor enhancer. I don't know anyone pregnant at this time but I can see how the Chipotle on top of ice cream could be an instant hit.<br /><br />Do I have to formally state that now I'm a believer and an instant fan? Very well, I do and I do.<br /><br />Give it a try but, if you're not sure, maybe you should try the smaller size first.

review/summary: Silver Springs Horseradish Mustard Organic, 9.5-Ounce (Pack of 9)
review/text: Purchased this organic by mistake, meant to buy there regular horseradish mustard that we purchase from SAM's club which they seem to have stopped carrying. But it seems it's alittle milder not as hot as the original & with the same great taste. So this may now  be the mustard of choice when ordering more?

review/summary: Delicious in cooking
review/text: I don't know how you're "supposed" to use grey salt.  I bought this once on a whim and have been re-ordering it ever since.  I don't sprinkle it directly on my food as the grains are a little bit too large for my taste.  I do use it frequently in cooking and notice a huge difference.  The grey salt adds a flavor to my food that I can't quite explain... You can't taste it, but you notice when it's not there.  I especially notice the difference in soups.  They just taste a lot better with grey salt and I tend to use quite a bit less of the grey than when I cook with table salt.  When I ran out of it for a few weeks, my family said that my meals weren't quite as good, but no one could really tell me what was missing.  I'll make sure that I don't run out of grey sea salt again!

review/summary: An Interesting Experience....
review/text: I have never experienced grey salt before, but I have been curious about it.  (My curiosity was prompted by its use by chefs and other foodies.)  Unable to find it in my local grocery store, I ordered it from Amazon.<br /><br />Since this is my first experience with grey salt, I cannot compare it to other brands.  I can tell you that it really is kind of grey in color, that the grains are large, and that the grains are moist.  As another reviewer mentioned, the moistness of the grains would probably make a salt mill not a good choice.<br /><br />I have been sprinkling it on my cooked food. The size of the grains mean that, when a bite contains a grain, you really 'experience' the saltiness of the salt.  The salt does not 'melt' too quickly into food, unless it is a liquid.<br /><br />I suppose that I do not have a sufficiently developed palate, because I do not really sense a lot of difference between grey and kosher salt in terms of taste.  Bottom line: I am glad that I tried it, plan to use it, but doubt that I buy more.

review/summary: I love this salt!
review/text: This salt has an excellent flavor. It is bright, clean, and fresh tasting with a slight citrusy flavor. It is excellent for flavoring all your dishes. I use it in moroccan tagines, curries, stews, pasta sauces, basically everything. Since it is a wet salt it is not good to use in most grinders. Just sprinkle it over your food. It is more flavorful than regular table or kosher salt so start with a little then add more as needed.

review/text: I found a bag of these at the local Big Lot store today.  I love needhams and hoped that these would be similar.  The coconut flavor is very weak.  These aren't really much different than regular M&Ms:  a bit bigger and some different colored coatings.  Not worth spending a lot of money on these.  I paid $2.50 for the 11.8 oz bag.  I wouldn't pay more than that, though.

I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my Great Northern purchases upon testing.  The ten flavors all taste very delicious and I prefer the texture of the shaved ice when G N P's syrup is poured on, as opposed to Hawaiian Shaved Ice's.  I'd definitely recommend this less expensive option for snow cone syrup!!

review/summary: Leaping for these treats
review/text: My 13 year old fox terrier has become a very picky eater the past few months.  I've tried so many different kinds of dog foods - canned, dry, raw frozen, homemade diets, as well as various treats.  He didn't want much of any of it until I bought the Evanger Pheasant with fruit/vegetables jerky dog treats!  My gosh, my dog leaps in the air and twirls as I'm trying to get the treats out of the bag for him!  I can't get them out fast enough.  He then races to the other room, sits, and anxiously awaits his treats - they're gone in seconds.  This is a home run.

So if you would like to give smaller treats, they are easily ripped apart. To me they smell like grain/oatmeal, but not like poultry.

review/text: In my humble opinion, these are oen of the best snack foods available.  A bit salty, but I like that.<br /><br />They are reasonably healthy and tasty and with Amazon's subscription discount, suprisingly affordable.  However, if you are getting two boxes at once, they ship it in this huge box that ALWAYS arrives as tho the shippers played football with it first.  it is probably a function of the large size and very light weight.  I have received three shipments so far and I believe every single one arrived that way and each time I had to discard one of the bags because it has had popped open during shipping.<br /><br />The 4 oz bag, tho a bit small, does help keep me from overindulging.

review/summary: Great product - Just be sure to inspect when it arrives!
review/text: We love the Pirate's Booty products and buy Veggie Booty, Tings and Pirate's Booty in bulk to save money, since it's only available at a few stores where we live and it's expensive out here.  My only complaint is that the last box we bought, we stored up in our pantry with only that front cardboard part pulled out, and just grabbed a new bag when we needed one.  I went to pull the box down today and discovered that 2 bags had opened at the top seam (or more likely had never properly been closed) and so had to throw them away.  That bums me out, and it raised the overall cost of the remaining 10 bags about 50 cents each.  Since I ordered the box over a month ago, I don't feel like I can request a refund, so my only advice is when you get your bulk package, don't just open the cardboard cutout and store it.  Be sure to go through and inspect each bag for any problems.  That way you can contact Amazon and get a replacement if there is something wrong.  Otherwise, I highly recommend these products at healthy alternatives for snacking kids (and adults).

review/text: Veggie Booty is my absolute favorite snack.  It has a subtle, yet tasty flavor, and beats fried, artificially flavored snacks that leave a lingering taste in one's mouth (but then again - my palate has a preference for health over junk).  And just how many snacks exist that are green and made with kale or spinach?  Very unique.  Consuming 3/4 of the bag in one sitting is not out of the ordinary for me.  Can't get enough!

You don't feel bloated and nasty after eating them, like you might (I do!) after eating a bag of potato chips or something akin to that. At first pop, I thought it didn't have a ton of taste. And then I let the flavors kind of settle in, and I realized the flavor was much more complex and savory than any snack I've ever had before. I mean, think of a potato chip: it tastes like grease, salt, and if you're lucky, you might get a tiny taste of potato. But these! These! I could taste the kale powder and broccoli powder (kale is my favorite food) and I could taste so much more flavor than I would ever expect from a simple bagged snack. By a few bites in, I was hooked. I finished the bag, and I wanted more! So, like I said, only 65 calories for the whole bag, and since they're puffed, I felt like I had eaten quite a substantial snack. I love these!

review/summary: Acquired taste, yes, but good for those with limited diets
review/text: I was drawn to these because I love the Pirate Booty with aged cheddar, but then I became lactose intolerant, along with developing an allergy to garlic. Do you know that garlic and some sort of milk product is in almost every snack food? These however are free of both. The first bite is not what you expect. The second bite is better, and by the third bite I was hooked. I have eaten a whole bag in one sitting (not recommended, by the way). I love these and can't live without them now.

review/summary: Arrrgh!
review/text: (I wonder if anyone else has seen the"Saturday Night Live" sketch about a convention of pirates whose discourse is limited to the"arrrgh" sound.)  This product tastes like alfalfa/barley juice, except the popcorn texture makes it difficult to make the taste go away simply by holding your nose.  As for all the health benefits, the veggies indeed impart "flavor" to this mish-mash, a bag of which equals 8 grams of protein plus nearly 600 calories, but what do the veggies contribute and what percentage of the product do they represent?  Unless I notice some dramatic health benefits, I'm going to have trouble disposing of 12 bags (Lesson: Even though Amazon limits you to large quantities, don't order 12 bags if you haven't first tried one).  The only way I can consume this stuff is to wash down every bite with a mouthful of cold Coke.  Or, picking up on the company's pirate theme, Coke laced with a lot of rum.  Unassisted by such complementary beverages, I'm afraid this booty elicits no pirate's celebratory "Arrrgh!" from me.  Just plain "Yuck!" is more like it.

review/text: I'm not able to buy Lapsang Souchong locally, and was pleased to find it on Amazon.  The price is good, and the quality of the Taylors of Harrogate is excellent.  It's stronger than the Twinings brand I've had before.<br /><br />Lapsang Souchang has a smoky taste; it's not a sweet tea at all.  It's interesting and different from other teas, but don't buy a big quantity until you've tried it for yourself.

review/summary: It's not only good, it's a steal!
review/text: I love Lapsang Souchong tea, which is hard to find in retail stores. The online choices are Twinning or this Taylors of Harrogate. I won't pretend to make a "connoisseur's" analysis of their relative merits; to me they both taste delicious, even though I do believe this (Taylors of Harrogate) tea to have a more pronounced taste (perhaps -- see below -- because there's more tea per cup???).<br /><br />But let's look at what we're asked to pay... This one is $0.12 per bag while Twinning's is $0.16. Moreover, each Taylors of Harrogate tea bag contains 25% more tea than Twinning's (2.5gr vs 2.00gr), so that an equal-weight Twinning tea bag would have to cost $0.20, or a Twinning-size tea bag of this would only only cost $0.09. So in effect we're asked to pay over twice as much per Twinning tea bag! Now, even if there were a difference between them (and they all come from the very same Chinese makers) and the Twinning were the better-tasting tea (which I dispute), it would still not be twice as good to justify spending the extra cash.<br /><br />Yes, it's a lot of tea to buy at once; but at my rate of consumption it represents about a bit less than eight months' supply, and the shipping is free.<br /><br />Finally, regarding that misguided soul who wrote the single 1-star review complaining about the expiration date... this stuff is bone dry, packed in cellophane. It has no meaningful shelf-life limitation. If I brewed you two cups of this tea, one from a freshly-bought box and another from a box that's 1-3 years past its expiration date, I'm confident that -- in a blind test -- you would not be able to tell the old from the new.

review/text: Lapsang Souchong tea is difficult to find, and it is an acquired taste, but I love its smoky flavor - Lapsang Souchong has more character than regular black tea, and it conjures up visions of sitting by a roaring fire on a cold winter's afternoon with a good book.  If you have never tried it before, you might not want to order this much, but if you have experienced Lapsang Souchong before, or if you're feeling bold and want to try something a bit rarer than Lipton's, I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Lots of Great Tea
review/text: Lapsang Souchong is definitely one of my absolute favorite teas.  I have tried both the Twinnings and Taylors of Harrogate brands of this tea and found the Taylors brand to be better in flavor and potency.  That being said, this product contains 300 teabags (that's a lot of tea!).  I would encourage tea adventurers to search your organic food stores to see if you can find smaller containers of lapsang souchong in order to try it before you buy.  The flavor is not difficult to get used to but may come as a shock to those used to other black teas.  That being said, my only issue with this product is the amount of tea contained within the order, which is enough to last for a year or more with moderate tea consumption.  If that's of no consequence to you, then I strongly urge you to buy this very delicious tea.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Convenient shaker, taste is fine
review/text: This is my first time trying stevia in any form or brand, and I just made myself my first cup of tea, sweetened with 5 very careful shakes of stevita until it was sweet enough.  I read a prior comment about dipping a toothpick twice and the tea being too sweet... maybe that was a different brand or a liquid, because with the filler it seemed to be about somewhere between half to equally as sweet as Splenda with the same amount.  So far the taste is fine... there's some mild bitter taste that lingers on my lips, that I would call "chemically" except that it's supposed to be natural.  I guess it's no worse than Splenda though, and certainly better than Equal and way better than Sweet'n'Low.  I figure if this can help me kick my addiction to fake sugar, and get my brain cells working again.  Probably not, until there is a Diet Coke made with stevia (which they say is in the works).  I'd say worth the try, but get it from a vitamin store where you don't pay the same amount of shipping as the actual stevia!

It's a pretty good price, too, compared to other stores.  We use about a bottle a week and haven't used sugar or other sugar substitutes since we found this a long time ago.  We buy the packets, too, to take with us on the go.  I take my packet to Starbuck's and have them add it before they foam my cappucinos.  I use it at home on everything, in chai, coffee, tea, on cereal.  It is simply the best and worth every penny.

There is none of that awesome gutsy taste that I'm used to enjoying with other habanero products.  I was expecting a nice mix of sweet and at least medium heat with lots of flavor.  All this has is lots of sweet, a very mild amount of heat and basically no flavor. Would not recommend this to pepper lovers!
