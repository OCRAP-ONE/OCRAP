review/summary: Love it!  Will never eat white sugar again
review/text: I am so in love with this product.  I have replaced using white sugar in my home and have been very pleased with this product.  I use it in my coffee everyday and I so enjoy the creamy sugariness (not a word, I know) that it brings.<br /><br />It is kind of brown sugar-like but not---so much better on every level!  It does tend to clump a bit but it is easy enough to break it up and it doesn't turn hard like brown sugar does.  I believe that I must have this product in my life.<br /><br />I haven't tried baking with it yet or anything so I can't speak to that at all.

I gave it only 4 stars because I haven't used it in a variety of recipes yet to see if the flavor difference is a plus or minus.  Amazon service was great.  Received the product in short time.

review/summary: Don't Buy
review/text: Be aware of what you are doing demanding this product<br /><br />[...]<br />So please, let's NOT sacrifice our coconut oil for coconut palm sugar!<br /><br />What no one is warning consumers about is that coconut palm trees are meant to produce coconuts, not sugar! When the sap used to make coconut palm sugar is collected from the coconut palm tree, from the flower bud that will eventually form a coconut, that tree can no longer produce coconuts! Think about that for a minute. No coconuts = no coconut oil, no dried coconut, no coconut flour. Is coconut sugar worth giving up these other valued products that come from the coconut??

review/summary: Too thin...and a quick chew.
review/text: A bit of disappointment in this bully stick due to lack of thickness.  Product Description is: 12" Select Bully Sticks - Pkg of 50. Select Bully Sticks are thicker and heavier than standard Bully Sticks.<br /><br />My 9 month golden retriever, who has spent a day or more on a competitor's 0.75" diameter bully sticks, tore through the first K-nine Kountry stick in ~15 minutes.  They are obviously very tasty to the dog, but they stunk up the house upon opening the bag (which we now keep out in the garage)<br /><br />Either K-nine Kountry sent me the wrong product or my expectations are out of whack.  A majority of the sticks average 3/8" or less in diameter.  I counted 6 of the 50 sticks that were 1/2" to 3/4" in diameter.  Personally, I can't imagine a bully stick getting any thinner than a majority of what I received, so the idea that they are "Select" is what concerns me.

review/summary: Gourmet-style equivalent of french fried onions (not in a can)
review/text: Understand: this same brand sells crispy red onions in bags that are essentially French fried onions like in a can, only crisper and more flavorful.  (The type of onions one puts on green bean casserole).  Crispy red peppers are the same thing, only made from peppers instead of onions.  So the pepper is not the star here, only about 50% of the product.  For what they are supposed to be, they are quite good.  Do not buy them expecting a lot of pepper--they are half breading.  They are crisp, not greasy, and are tasty as a snack or a topping for other foods.  I add them to camping food and travel food for variety.

review/summary: Me, too!!
review/text: I, too, always loved Old El Paso relish, and when I found this I was really excited!  I went ahead and ordered a case (which I received in 3 days!!).  I found it to be as close as I've ever found to Old El Paso.  It didn't have the "kick" (I really like HOT food), but I found it be a great substitute (after looking for something comparable for about three years).  I see there are only three cases left -- do we know if there will be more ordered to keep here at Amazon (for when we need our "fix"), or does anyone know where we can order directly if and when Amazon quits having it in stock?  Thanks again -- first thing I did was fix some Juevos Rancheros (probably spelled that wrong) and they were great!

review/text: I too was an Old El Paso Jalapeno Relish user, and have been searching for a substitute for a long time. I searched everywhere for the Old El Paso Relish, and finally contacted the company and found out that the relish was no longer being produced. Several months ago, while shopping at one of our local grocery stores, on the isle with the Mexican foods, was a label on the shelf that said Casa Fiesta Jalapeno Relish, but no products. I was told an order was made, but no products were sent, and to keep checking. After two weeks of checking, the label was removed, and another product was in it's place, so the search was on again (website) and here it is. Casa Fiesta, please continue this product for all of us Jalapeno Relish lovers, it is delicious, now my spaghetti sauce will have that special flavor again.

review/text: These are nearly impossible to find by me, so I jumped at the chance to get them at a discount. Even though they are unsweetened, carob is naturally sweet, so you get the treat without the sugar. The almonds are always high quality, and tasted like they have been roasted a little prior to being coated with the carob. These aren't vegan, so if you are, sorry, but they are not for you.<br /><br />Overall, a good candy for those of us who cannot eat chocolate.

I contact Amazon Customer Service to see if a return of the unopened products was possible, unfortunately not but they automatically offered a refund without me even asking. Was very pleased with this and will end up donating the 11 boxes of unused/unopened product.<br /><br />I was excited to see Jolly Time listed for subscription offering as my husband and I really enjoy the 94% fat free version we find in the market. The description said it was a white popcorn and seemed to be pretty healthy as it had no butter. When we popped it, it was a little greasy tasting instead of light. It left a little grease on the paper towel it sat in. Unfortunately not too pleased with this but we bought a supply so will have to eat it/give it away!

That was ok except that the carob never really fully dried, but instead made the cookies tacky sticky.

review/summary: My dog loves these - they help his teeth stay clean
review/text: I originally started my dog with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WBZ47C">Paragon Hedgehogs</a> - made of the same substance at the toothbrushes, but in a larger form factor - when he was a teething puppy about a year ago.  At that time, he was really slow to finish an entire Hedgehog, but once his adult teeth came in, the thing would be gone in a day and that was way too much dental chew to be ingesting at a time.  Now we give him one toothbrush a day after dinner.  He'll spend half an hour looking for the perfect hiding spot for it and then give in and eat it.  He loves these "toothbrushes" and gets so excited when we give one to him.<br /><br />These treats are made from vegetable starch and have a mild smell like potatoes.  They are currently made in Holland.<br /><br />The "toothbrushes" come in a few sizes. Our pup is 15lbs and we give him the "toothbrushes" from the "small 28ct" bag.<br /><br />The one issue I have with these chews is that they contain titanium dioxide (for coloring) which some studies show is toxic in large quantities.  I'd prefer if they left this ingredient out but unfortunately I've found that nearly every dog chew has something questionable in it.

review/text: Our three dogs love these chews, which we alternate with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CE9I9S">Sam's Yams Big Boyz Sweet Potato Dog Treats, 1-Pound Bag</a>. A daily dose of these chew treats seems to minimize the tartar buildup. We usually feed this medium size to our two 50 pound-ish dogs and the large size to our 65-lb Aussie/Chow mix. We appreciate the all veg, highly digestible ingredients and great chewing action (they're good and chewy, but not hard enough a dog might break a tooth on them), and the fact they're made in Holland, while our dogs seem to appreciate the flavor and gum-massaging action. Be sure to have plenty of fresh water available for your dog, as ours always enjoy a good long drink after finishing their chew treats.<br /><br />This product comes in a variety of sizes, and the sizing information isn't always clear. The "product dimensions" given here describe the size of the PACKAGING, not the product. For clarification, these Paragon medium-sized Star Toothbrushes measure 4" long and 1 1/8th" wide at their widest point (the base of the "handle,") while the large size are 5 1/2" long and 1 1/2" wide at their widest point. I hope that's helpful.

More than $15 for a box of cereal...??!!...not to mention the $8+ shipping fee...that's >$17 per pound for Captain Crunch cereal?<br /><br />Hey fellow-Amazon shoppers...I did the math...you can make a breakfast FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR using USDA choice NY Strip steak, jumbo eggs, whole wheat toast, home fries and OJ for what it costs you to buy just ONE box of CC cereal from Amazon and a half gallon of 2% milk.<br /><br />Oh yeah...and the diner down the street from me (I live in NJ...a convenience store and diner on every corner) has the same meal for $7.99...so TWO of you could eat out for the price of one Amazon box of Capt Crunch...that's disgusting and unethical.

review/summary: Very Disappointed in cake quality
review/text: I do quite a bit of online ordering of all types, and especially of food items that are not available in the area where I live.  I had purchased this cake for Christmas and was very disappointed.  The appearance was segmented, like monkey bread, but that was not disappointing.  The texture of the cake was dry and leathery, and the flavor rather stale and bland.  I had never ordered one of these cakes before, and relied on the reviews written by others.  The packaging of the cake was great and arrival of the cake was very prompt.<br />My advice to those who have never tried this cake before: If you want a stale leathery textured, bland flavored cake, you'd be wiser to go to Big Lots and buy one for $2.00.

review/summary: Diet Coke: the real thing!
review/text: This eleven pound serving of Diet Coke, tastefully ensconced in a convenient twelve ounce can, is perhaps deceptive. Its mass might lead the consumer to believe that it somehow tastes different than the usual nutrient-free, chemically-laden glop that comprises Diet Coke, which seems to have become the International Women's Beverage. (As a person with a Y chromosome, I do not have the gender qualifications to drink this beverage, but I tried one anyway, along with some yogurt, the International Women's Food, as suggested by The Lifetime Channel and their wonderful films.) After careful evaluation, I determined that the eleven-pound mass of this can was not achieved by the addition of fruit juices or any actual nutritional food-like ingredients to the chemical glop. I now realized that some of the carbonated "bubbles" are actually black holes, a de-formation of space-time caused by collapsing stars, formerly difficult to obtain for the consumer but now conveniently available in these handy eleven-pound cans of diet coke. (I tried to give this product a five-star review, but somehow the five stars collapsed into two stars that each weigh 5.5 pounds.) Buy it! Drink it! The Black Hole Diet will not make you lose mass (quite the opposite), but it is entertaining and educational, and you can participate in the International Women's Cuisine Mandate while watching films about deceptive men on The Lifetime Channel.

review/summary: Go for the burn!
review/text: You are probably asking, "Why would you review Diet Coke?"  It's a damn soda. It costs almost nothing! We've all had it and are probably already addicted and strung out to D.C.  Well, the truth is that I am a true Coke connoisseur.  I have spent many hours discussing a good coca-cola versus a crap coca-cola. This is a drink that can draw out the flavors of a good meal, just like a fine bottle of wine or cold glass of milk.<br /><br />Originally I only drank regular Coke. But there is no need to have all that high fructose corn syrup. It will ultimately lead to your demise.  So make the switch to Diet Coke. You may need to do some 50/50 blends for a while, but in a couple of weeks you won't go back to regular Coke (it tastes way too sugary now).  In general, any soda from a can actually can taste pretty bad due to changes in carbonation, flavor of the can, etc.  But a soda from a bottle (glass or plastic) is the best.  You know the batch is good when there is a major burn in your mouth after a big gulp.  Pepsi won't do this the same, the pH is different and it has a different sugar content.  Diet Coke has the perfect burn.  Fountain soda almost universally sucks, so don't even go there.<br /><br />I recommend that D.C. accompany any rich, flavorful meal.  It may overpower meals that have subtle flavors (for example, some French cuisine is quite subtle in flavor to me, and D.C. may wash it away).  You already know D.C. will enhance the flavors of beef, fried food, pizza, potato chips (and most other snacks), most sandwiches, Italian foods of almost any variety, and greasy chili cheese dogs.<br /><br />So go buy a 2 liter, chill (4 degrees celsius at the lowest, preferably a degree or two warmer), go work off all that high fructose corn syrup you ate earlier in the day, and then getcha pull of D.C.<br /><br />If you don't like my review, you must be a Pepsi fan.  So be it.  Your teeth will rot sooner, it's got a lower pH.

review/text: These chocolates are my absolute favorite chocolate in the world and I used to have to wait for occasions to travel to Europe to get them.  Opening a box of these is like opening a treasure box.  Each ball when dissected reveals its multiple sinful layers--I love cutting them in half and appreciating their complexity before popping them into my mouth. Sometimes when I'm feeling particularly glutinous I just put a whole one in there and let it sit and melt for a couple of seconds before compressing it and eating it.  It's an amazingly satisfying feeling I get when I eat these. I have tried all kinds of chocolates (fancy ones from Brussels and the like) and I still love the Mozart balls the best!

review/text: What separates these olives from the more common store-offerings is: their saline solution is mild so the salt flavor is not overpowering, but very slight; they are very large.  For me they are well worth the price, incuding the shipping cost.  I have found no other offering to be thier equal.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AIHPCO">Bella di Cerignola Olives by DeCarlo</a>

My advice is to never ever try these as they are totally addictive and you'll be eating them for the rest of your life!! If, unfortunately, you're already hooked like me, this is a very good and economical way to purchase them.

review/summary: Ohhhhh!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I got hooked on these about a month ago and I have craved these since then. These things are little pieces of heaven in a bag. They have so much flavor condensed in such a little gummy circles. Be careful, you will get addicted. In fact, if you don't mind Please do not buy any of these. If these ever go out of stock, I literally might have a heart attack.<br />But on the serious side, these things are packed full of sugar and thats all. If you do like me and eat the whole bag in a day, thats almost 1400 calories. Not very good for my diet though. The deal on amazon is pretty fairly priced. If you buy these from the gas station, they cost $1.29 for only 2.5 ounce. They say that 10 pieces is a serving, yea right. I'm just getting started on 10 pieces. Stick with these instead of the original flavor, I find those taste like chewy pieces of rubber. I agree with the other person that we need an auto ship program for these. Amazon, please don't let these ever get out of stock!<br />I'm on my way to the gas station to pick up a few bags because I'm out right now and stupid UPS doesn't deliver on Saturday or Sundays.

review/text: I have been enjoying Chartreuse Teas for three years.  Their blends are fantastic, their teas are hand packaged, and the flavors couldn't be more vivid.<br /><br />This is nothing like the teabag tea you are used to.  You'll actually see the petals, the berries, the clipped grasses, the small chips of real organic material that, when you soak them in hot water, release their all-natural oils, vitamins and amazing flavors.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Seems more pepperminty than spearminty
review/text: First of all, I'm a big fan of Chartreuse organic teas, due to their superb quality.  Because I'm a fan, I took a risk on this blend.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed is spearmint, and I guess I had my own notion of what spearmint would taste like.  To me, spearmint is more subtle than peppermint and maybe a little sweeter.  The expectations I had weren't met, however, because to me, this tea tastes of peppermint--and a vibrant peppermint at that.  I don't care for it, but maybe it's just me.<br /><br />To use up what I've purchased, I'm going to experiment with mixing this with other loose teas, to blunt the minty flavor.  I'm also going to try making it extra strong for iced tea, and adding some sweetener, to see how I like it. I figure this will be worth my time and effort, because of the high quality of the tea itself.

review/text: I am an espresso lover, sometimes I try something different. Nescafe Espresso is a very pleasant surprise. Generally instant coffee doesn't have the nice intense aroma and flavour of espresso, but this one does! When I prepare it my house smells exactly like my favourite coffee shops. It tastes better when I put less coffee and make it without sugar. Take a small bite of chocolate, after it melts, take a sip of Nescafe Espresso, it is great. The bad news is that this is a limited edition...

review/summary: Love it
review/text: It came without serving size as it is not for US; called the company and they helped. (They didn't know how to make the Mocha Cappuccino and put the recipe I gave them in their break room!) Anyways to make my size, I use 10 oz of milk-my choice-, 1 oz of Hershey's chocolate, and 3/4 tablespoon of Nescafe Expresso Instant Coffee.  Then whip it up with a mini blender-which can be purchases for under 7 dollars, or 30 dollars if you want the fancy ones, put all in microwave-minus the mixer :), and watch it heat. It takes about 2-2 1/2 min. in my microwave. In the meantime I have added hot water to heat the inside of the container I am using. When the drink is hot enough for you, put in the drinking container, add some whip cream from the can, sit, and forget about your troubles. The froth someone got in there and is excellent. Does this help? Only wish it wasn't so expensive, however, have a espresso machine-using same recipe, but 2 ounces of espresso instead-which is more work but less expensive. Do you suppose if we all wrote to Nescafe, they might sell it in stores?
