review/summary: Lovely subtle vanilla flavor!
review/text: I was worried the vanilla flavor would be too overpowering, but I was pleasantly surprised to taste it and it was just a nice subtle vanilla flavor. I like that it's pre-ground as well since I usually have little time in the morning and it's just one less step I have to worry about. I would highly recommend this product if you like your coffee with a hint of flavor!

review/summary: Flavor of the bean
review/text: I am not necessarily a fan of Starbucks coffee, nor of flavored coffees, but I have to say that I found this particular coffee very smooth and the flavor was not the usual overpowering, cloying stuff that you usually get when you get a flavored coffee. I use about 7-8 scoops (note: varies with the size of your scoop, mine is about a tablespoon size when heaping, perhaps a touch more) for a 12 cup pot and get a very nice tasting/smelling pot of coffee. I can see having more of this coffee when the current bag is done. P-)

review/text: I'm not a big Starbucks fan...I think their beans taste burned and bitter.  That said, surprisingly, I really like this coffee.  It still has some of the strong, Starbucks coffee flavor that some really like, but it is nicely mellowed with the vanilla flavor.  The vanilla is not crazy strong, but if you don't like flavored coffee, you won't like this.  I found it to be a great morning coffee.  I drink it with half and half and like the smooth, creamy, vanilla taste.

review/text: Well, let me start off, I'm not really a coffee drinker. I only drink it when I'm tired. So I thought this would be nice to try since it has a little bit of vanilla flavor in it to make it taste better. So I would have to say it taste pretty good for coffee, but if you're expecting it to take taste like vanilla Frapuccino, you will be disappointed :-) . It has a nice light flavor of vanilla in it to give your coffee a unique taste.

review/summary: The first flavored coffee we really like! Will buy again.
review/text: I ordered this coffee at at good price, not for the name. But both my husband and I were surprised that we really did enjoy the flavor and aroma without noticing a bitter after-taste. We are by no means coffee experts, we just drink our morning cup to get us going. We've tried different brands and don't usually give much care either way, except for flavored coffees which we usually avoid due to bitterness. They always smell so nice, but the taste, yuck. So maybe there is something to the Starbucks brand, it was good coffee, and I'll have to try some other flavors to see if they stand up to our taste testing as well.<br /><br />I should note that we make our coffee using an aero press which helps in taking much of the bitter taste out of coffee and we usually drink our coffee with just skim milk.

review/summary: Good coffee with a small flavor boost
review/text: The Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored is a very smooth tasting coffee.  There is a very small hint of vanilla flavor that did NOT have a chemical taste.  However, I would have preferred more of a vanilla flavoring as opposed to the minute amount in this coffee.  All in all, this is a good coffee that is not bitter.  I would recommend it to coffee drinkers but not to those who are looking for a burst of additional flavor.

Well much to my surprise I didn't have to blend this at all, in fact I really couldn't taste any vanilla at all. It is a great tasting coffee but I really wanted vanilla. Maybe that's why it was selling so cheaply.

review/summary: Great Smelling Vanilla Coffee
review/text: I like me some Starbucks coffee.<br /><br />When it is on sale or I have a chance to pick it up when out with a friend, it is always a treat.  I was excited when I saw a deal featuring their new Natural Fusions Ground Coffee on Amazon.<br /><br />I placed my order and (because of Prime) got it in two days. The first thing I noticed was the intense vanilla smell. I could smell it through the bag. After opening the coffee and making a bit, I was expecting an almost over-powering vanilla taste, not the case.<br /><br />I could only taste a hint of vanilla in the coffee.  That was OK, but I was hoping for a bit more.  Over-all, it is a good tasting coffee that has a decent boldness. While I prefer non-flavored coffee, I will admit, this coffee tastes pretty good and makes a strong consideration for future purchases. Especially if I can get it on sale.

review/text: It has a nice smell when you open the package, but not all that much like coffee. More like Vanilla extract,it really is very lightly flavored compared to regular Starbucks, it could be called Starbucks lite. It has a very pleasent taste but weak. I think if you use a bit more than the usual amount it has a more powerful kick but still not Starbucks par. You can taste a slight Vanilla flavor still not nearly as strong as other flavored coffee I have tried, still very pleasent and tasty though. Not sure I would buy this varity for myself. I like mine a little stronger. If you like a weaker flavored coffee, then you will like this.

review/summary: Nice product as flavored coffees go.
review/text: First off, I think it's fair I mention that I'm not a big flavored-coffee fan. That said, I did enjoy this product more than I thought I would. I chose it as a change of pace over my usual dark roasted plain coffees. The vanilla flavoring is subtle, natural-tasting, and doesn't leave much of an after taste as many flavored coffees do. It's a lot more affordable on Amazon now, but when I received it, it was way over priced. Starbucks coffee is always over-priced (in my opinion) but this stuff was crazy expensive at first.<br /><br />Definitely recommended if you are a flavored coffee lover, and can get it at a fair price. I just ordered some of the cinnamon variety and can't wait to give it a taste, too.

review/summary: Great Starbucks Coffee at Home!
review/text: As coffee lovers know, it is sometimes hard to get the same flavor and consistency of brand names at home.  In the case of Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee this is NOT the case.  The coffee is just as good as what you'd get at their shop (though you do have to make it yourself) with a rich and fragrant vanilla taste. Following the recipe as listed, yields a great cup of coffee (which I have not always found to be the case when I purchase brand name coffee - I often have to "fiddle" with the guidelines to produce something close to what I get at their restaurant/shop).  The bag came very compressed and wrinkled and I was initially worried that this would impact its taste but we've made multiple cups since opening up the bag and each has been delicious and the bag itself does the usual job of keeping the product fresh (though I doubt we'll have it for long as good as it is).  If you like Starbucks and/or vanilla coffee, this is a product for you.

review/text: I've tried lots of flavored coffees, and most taste artificial and eventually wear out their welcome. This one is great. It has just enough vanilla to be flavored, but not too much to overpower. This does brew up quite strong, almost as strong as espresso with one tablespoon coffee to one cup of water. However, it's great for my purposes. I've developed an addiction to adding it to warm milk and brown sugar for a vanilla and brown sugar latte (I froth my milk by shaking it up in a jar and microwaving it).  I bet I can't get it that way at Starbucks, but that's okay because I can make it at home just fine ... and cheaper.

Also, although one of the ingredients is a sweetener, I really didn't find that the coffee tasted significantly sweetened either.  Overall, it's still a pretty good coffee, but don't buy it expecting much vanilla flavor or sweetness because you will probably be disappointed.

When we stop at a Starbucks' coffee shop, we know that we'll be paying a good deal more for the coffee -- but we're glad (?) to do so.  It's really fine coffee.  And so too with this 11-ounce package of ground coffee -- the price is more than a bit higher than the regular coffees.  And the taste, especially this one with the strong hint of vanilla, is better too.<br /><br />So treat yourself at home.  Buy the packaged ground Starbucks coffee and get that same great taste.

review/text: It's very difficult to review a product that is so strongly contingent upon personal taste. That being said, I rarely drink flavored coffees but do like them once in a while as a change of pace. When I drink these types of coffees, I prefer to flavoring to be light so that it does not overwhelm the natural coffee flavor. This product almost achieves that balance but the vanilla is just a bit too strong for my taste, hence only 4 stars. If you prefer the flavoring to be a little stronger than I do, then you will love this coffee. It's very robust and flavorful and it smells fantastic while brewing.

review/text: Let me say that I'm a big fan of Starbucks fresh-brewed coffee, so it's a nice treat to have it at home too. From a pure coffee perspective, I really enjoyed the rich, medium-strength taste of this finely-ground coffee. It's not quite your local fresh-brewed, but still very good for my average drip coffee maker.<br /><br />Most flavored coffees just blow you over with aroma and flavor, so I find the subtlety  Starbucks Natural Fusions refreshing. But, if you're really looking for a vanilla-flavored coffee, you might want to look elsewhere - it's that subtle.<br /><br />Of course, the cost is more than your run-of-the-mill coffee in a plastic crate. But for me, the difference in taste and quality is worth it. I've ordered more!

review/text: The nice thing about vanilla is that it is subtle.  Unlike other flavors often used in coffees (cinnamon, fall spices, etc.) vanilla is not meant to be a strong flavor.  It is truly their to compliment the coffee.  The vanilla flavor is very natural and takes the edge off the coffee.  The smoothness of the coffee does not overpower the vanilla, and the flavors do not seem to be competing for space on your palette.  I would recommend this coffee as an enjoyable break from your everyday blend.

If you're a flavored coffee drinker and you prefer the flavor over the coffee taste, this may not be the one for you.<br />Since I do not typically drink flavored coffee the ingredient list still left me a little uneasy..although "natural"(which really has such a loose, if any, definition when used in labeling food)the ingredients were just things I was not used to seeing listed on a coffee package.<br />They were, in order listed:<br /> Ground Coffee, Natural Flavor (with Corn Maltodextrin, Vegetable Glycerin), Ground Vanilla Beans, Indidan Sarsaparilla Root<br />So, more "natural flavor" than actual vanilla beans. Also, glad I checked before serving this coffee to a close friend of mine who has corn allergies.<br />A plus I discovered while examining the bag, it says if you bring the empty bag in to one of the US Starbucks stores they'll exchange it for a free 12oz coffee (within 30days of the "best Before" date). :)

review/summary: Smooth pleasant flavor- better than VIA vanilla
review/text: Generally I find that flavored coffees always seem to smell better than they taste.  It seems like the special flavor disappears once they are brewed.  And, I have to admit, I threw out the first pot I brewed of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla because it was too bland.  So when I made the next pot, I added an extra tablespoon of coffee and that made all the difference.  The vanilla scent is very natural and not perfume-y, and the vanilla flavor is nice, but not overpowering.  Add a little milk and sugar and it's a special treat.  I much prefer this to the VIA vanilla packets which, although more convenient, are too strong-flavored and too sweet for me.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you like flavored coffee that is subtle, but well-balanced, this is a good one to purchase.  Just be prepared to add an extra tablespoon or so when you make it.

review/summary: Nice for a Starbucks item
review/text: This is a bit stronger than other vanilla coffees that I enjoy such as New England.  Depending upon your taste, you can enjoy a stronger brew or reduce the amount of coffee you use. I simply use a bit less coffee.  I was skeptical about this coffee as I find Starbucks coffee at the local stores has a burnt taste to it lately and I avoid their coffee in general.  This is a nice rich coffee and there is no hint of burnt coffee flavor.

review/summary: Nice Subtle Vanilla Flavor
review/text: Subtle vanilla flavor if you don't like your coffee too heavily flavored. My husband, who usually doesn't care for "regular" Starbucks (unlike me) did like this coffee. I actually switched his out (Duncan Donuts) and he noticed it was different but said he really enjoyed it. As for me, I really prefer this to the VIA style with the sugar added, this is much more robust and stands well in an expresso. Nice product, I may give it as a gift for my coffee buddies!

review/text: I hope I don't offend but I am not a regular visitor to Starbucks.  It is not because I don't like them but it is because I usually have my coffee at home.  Their product is actually pretty good from the few times I have been to one of their stores.  This product ranks high on my list of prepackaged coffees.  Light as I like it, but very flavorful, it is a nice way to start the day.  Don't shy away from it because it has a "chain restaurant" brand, it is actually pretty good.

review/summary: Vanilla? or Hazelnut? Good coffee, either way.
review/text: I admit, I'm not a huge Starbucks coffee fan (yes, there are those of out there who aren't), but I do enjoy flavored coffees, so looked forward to trying this Natural Fusions Vanilla-Flavored Ground Coffee from Starbucks. I thoroughly enjoyed the coffee, but I do question whether it is actually "vanilla" flavored or hazelnut. It tasted no different from the Hazelnut coffees I buy, and I didn't get a sense of vanilla from it at all. That aside, the coffee was robust and had a natural taste to it. Measurements for my coffee maker were the same as regular coffee, which is a positive since I often have flavored coffees that require extra coffee to get a deep coffee flavor. I did not rate this coffee 5 star because the flavoring was so deep that it actually flavored my thermal carafe, and that flavor stayed for 5 or 6 more pots of "regular" coffee, despite being washed out thoroughly after each use. Overall, I think hazelnut coffee lovers will love this coffee, though vanilla coffee lovers might be surprised at the hazelnut flavor! Good coffee and I will buy more for those nights when a special cup of coffee is just right.

review/text: Ok, so I think this is a great coffee for people who like strong coffee. Me, I'm more of a "McDonalds" type coffee drinker because I have found it to be a weak coffee, which is perfect for me. I wanted to try this Starbucks vanilla because I like the smell of vanilla. So I brewed it at home, and drank a bit. Personally, it was too strong for me, though the vanilla flavor was subtle and a nice touch. I added more milk than usual, and that seemed to help.<br /><br />Am I giving up my McDonalds coffee? No, but that's no fault of the Starbucks vanilla. I prefer my coffee less strong, that's just me!

review/text: I often will add a teaspoon of sugar-free vanilla syrup to my coffee so I was excited to try this vanilla flavored coffee from Starbucks.  Like most Starbucks coffees this one is very strong and robust, but the hint of vanilla actually helps to cut some of the bitterness.  The vanilla isn't overwhelming and does not leave that unpleasant toothpaste-like aftertaste that some flavored coffees do.  I found that I didn't need to add as much sugar or cream. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and found this more drinkable than Starbucks' traditional or non-flavored blends.

review/summary: Vanilla vanilla tastes like vanilla
review/text: This coffee opens up with a vanilla cookie odor and brews up the same. If you like your coffee to taste like coffee this is probably not for you. If you tend to use vanilla creamer that is what it tastes like but for me to drink it I have to add sugar because the vanilla has a bitter flavor, same as when you use vanilla in cooking.<br />So in the end for me I doubt I would get it again because I don't like adding sweeteners to my coffee, it really is going to be personal choice so maybe go to a Starbuck's and ask them to brew you a cup before buying. One nice touch is you can take the empty bag into a Starbuck's and get a free coffee.

review/text: With a lot of flavored coffee I find that the smell is better than the taste and that after a few sips I'm very tired of the flavor.  Not so with this coffee.  The vanilla is perfect.  The coffee isn't like most Starbucks coffees (where it is strong and a bit burnt).  I would recommend this coffee for people who aren't really into flavored coffee but want to take a walk on the wild side of coffees.  Perfect for the holidays as well.

review/summary: Did Starbucks forget a Key Ingredient?
review/text: I was never a coffee drinker in the past. The bitter and often foul flavor of ordinary coffee was not to my liking and, other than the often-needed boost from the caffeine, I could see no reason to indulge in something with such a nasty flavor.<br /><br />My opinion changed with the invention of flavored and higher quality coffees and as a result of this change, coffee is part of my regular drinking routine. Starbucks is one of the pioneers in leading these changes and when I heard about this, Starbucks Natural Fushions ground coffee with vanilla flavor, I was anxious to sample. Starbucks makes this product using natural vanilla which, combined with quality coffee, sounded like a successful culinary marriage.<br /><br />So, how does this coffee measure up? Well, it certainly has a very pleasant aroma that whets the appetite and I doubt anyone would dislike this aspect of the product. The problem is, unfortunately, the taste itself. I was expecting something much more vanilla- like in flavor but the flavor is instead a little harsh, roasty, and contains only a touch of vanilla. How Starbucks managed to produce such an aromatic product that tastes so different, I am not sure.<br /><br />However, this isn't to say the product is bad. I find it decent as a general coffee for everyday consumption. I also like that Starbucks encourages recycling by offering a free cup of coffee if consumers bring the empty bag to a nearby Starbucks location. The coffee is responsibly grown and ethically traded, too, as indicated by the Starbucks Shared Planet symbol. However, the bottom- line is taste and based on the lack of real vanilla flavor, like I was expecting, I can give this product only an average rating overall.

review/text: I love Starbucks, but had never tried their ground coffee so I thought I'd give their Vanilla coffee a try. It wasn't quite the same as grabbing a latte at one of their stores, but it was pretty darn good overall. There wasn't as much of a strong vanilla taste as I was expecting, in fact the vanilla was very subtle.<br /><br />It was smooth and rich. Very good coffee and worth the splurge - especially on a cold winters day.

review/summary: a bag of coffee doesn't need 300 reviews....
review/text: This one is pretty good and a good deal especially with the Amazon promotion going on right now.  I use it with my Keurig coffee maker and it's so much nicer than some of the expensive k-cups I purchased.  I can taste the vanilla just fine and it's enough vanilla for me.  Not artificial tasting, just a nice hint of flavor, very smooth.  That's how I like my coffee so this is a good buy for me.  A warning to those who are single...this is ground coffee so buying a lot at a time may not be a good idea.  My 2-pack both expire in May 2011 and at only one cup a day, I may not finish it by then.  So I'm storing the extra bag in the freezer.

review/text: From a coffee standpoint, I thought this wasn't bad.  If you drink Starbucks coffee regularly, it'll taste just fine.  (For those with more refined tastes, I imagine this won't go over quite as well.)  It's definitely a step up from the Folger's and Maxwell's provided at my work.<br /><br />That said, where's the vanilla?  I could barely taste it!  When I tried using more coffee to increase the flavor, the resulting brew was too bitter.  Milk and sugar did nothing to enhance the vanilla flavor.

review/summary: Great coffee underneath vanilla alcohol aftertaste
review/text: The title of this review says it all. There is a great depth of flavor and full robust coffee under a somewhat annoying aftertaste of cheap vanilla extract. I brewed it according to package directions, measuring everything exactly. I figured I could adjust and go from there. The coffee itself is deep, dark, and very robust - just the way I like it. I simply cannot stand what many people like, the common watered-down breakfast or house blends - yuk. I do like an occasional flavored coffee if done right. This time, however, Starbucks simply ruined the concept with that hideous alcohol after bite. If I brew with less coffee, I lose the delicious robustness of the star - the coffee. I wish I knew which bean blend they used as a base. I would buy that on it's own. I won't be purchasing this vanilla fusion any time soon. I may try the cinnamon one next.

review/text: Though I prefer my coffee plain, bold and with cream (My Starbuck's favorites are Pike's Place and Verona.) I was intrigued by Starbucks new offerings...naturally infused flavored coffee.<br /><br />Starbucks vanilla infusion is a flavorful marriage of both decent coffee and fresh vanilla flavor. Not as bold as Pike's but still bold enough to deliver the coffee flavor I need in the morning to jumpstart my day. The vanilla is strong enough that I didn't wonder what the flavor was supposed to be. It is definitely vanilla but without a cloying fake taste. It makes for a perfect companion to dessert or as a mid-afternoon pick-me-up.<br /><br />I think those who love flavored coffees and especially those who want those flavored coffees to be natural should find much to like in the new Starbuck's fusions.

review/text: I drink about two cups of coffee a day and love flavored coffee.  I was excited to get this free to try and I love Starbucks.  This coffee fell short for me.  I made numerous cups trying to perfect the flavor and could never get it to appeal to me.  The cofee is VERY robust.  Had I followed the directions of two tablespoons per cup I might have had a heart attack!  I used less than that and it was way too strong (bitter to me), and yet the vanilla flavor was barely evident. I tried reducing it more and it was still bitter with no vanilla flavor.  The scent is mild.  I will just stick with my Dunkin Donuts brand and add vanilla creamer.  If you like very robust coffee (knock your socks off robust) with only a hint of flavor you will probably like this, it just wasn't for me.

review/text: This is actually a pretty good vanilla coffee, but the coffee base is much milder than what I prefer - I like my coffee strong. This, however, is so you can taste the vanilla better. When compared to the Melitta vanilla coffee (which was also offered on Vine), this one wins hands down. The vanilla in the starbucks coffee is much milder than the melitta version which allows you to enjoy the coffee itself rather than being overpowered by the vanilla. Overall, if you are looking for a mild, yet well flavored, vanilla coffee, this is a very good choice.

The packaging for this shipment was appropriate, as was the actual bag containing the ground coffee, which included a way for re-sealing to maintain freshness.<br /><br />As for the taste of the coffee, which is really the most important factor, I was not that fond of the vanilla aspect of the flavor. I'm not certain why, but vanilla in Coffeemate tastes fine to me, but the vanilla 'infusion' into this coffee simply tasted too artificial for my palate, even when adding a non-flavored creamer. My advice is to add flavor to your coffee, if desired, only after the brewing process.

But this vanilla-flavored "Natural Fusions" ground coffee...man, that's something special. The vanilla bean flavor isn't overpowering, but it's not too subtle. It's the right median, just want I look for in a flavored blend. Just give me a hint of that flavor, don't hit me over the head with it. And did I mention how aromatic it is?

review/text: Normally, we love Starbucks' coffee, and so we were inclined to like this version of it. However, both me and my Significant Other found the vanilla flavor too strong. For some reason, this is not a pleasant vanilla flavor; I want to say that the aftertaste is a bit on the medicinal side. I wouldn't say the unpleasantness had anything to do with the vanilla flavor being sweet - it wasn't, although to me, not being sweet was a good idea. An added flavor, especially in a coffee labeled "natural fusions", ~should~ be just a taste and not mixed up with sugars or syrup.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this flavor didn't work for two people. The coffee was otherwise full-bodied, but I can't say it was smooth because of the vanilla attack in the flavoring.

review/text: There's not a lot to say about this coffee other than that the "natural fusion" of vanilla is so subtle that no one in my family could even say for sure that it was in there.<br /><br />"I don't taste any vanilla," said my wife.<br />"Neither do I," said I.<br />"It's a good vanilla coffee," said my daughter, "for people who don't like vanilla."<br /><br />I think she pretty well summed it up right there.

review/summary: Smooth, Not Bitter, but Vanilla?
review/text: I've been drinking coffee every morning of my adult life and in recent years have developed a fondness for flavored coffees. My favorites are mocha, cinnamon, and hazelnut. Thus I welcomed the opportunity to try a Starbucks flavored coffee, Natural Fusions no less.<br /><br />I love opening a fresh container of coffee to experience that heavenly burst of fresh, intense coffee aroma. When my bag of Starbucks Vanilla had its grand opening, I must say I was disappointed by the lack of a distinct vanilla aroma or anything resembling aroma. I figured I'd just have to wait for the actual brew to experience the promised vanilla flavor.<br /><br />So how is the coffee's vanilla flavor? Does it make up for the lack of that heavenly coffee scent that eluded me? Let's put it this way. If I were given a blind taste test,I'd be hard pressed to identfy this coffee as vanilla flavored. In fact, I'm not sure I could match any specific flavor to this coffee. It's obviously flavored to this taster, but I can only recognize that distant, nebulous vanilla taste because of the flavor's word printed on the bag.<br /><br />Overall this is a pleasant coffee. It's smooth, not bitter, and has a pleasant aftertaste. But if you are looking for a readily identifiable vanilla accent, you will have to be satisfied with vageuely vanilla.

review/summary: Not A Fan But Would Drink It In a Pinch
review/text: 3 Tries, 3 people and an average rating of 3 Stars.<br /><br />The unanimous conclusion: It's okay.<br /><br />Getting ready to brew our first sample, we agreed that the coffee in the bag smelled spectacular. The process of brewing significantly stripped much of the flavor noted when the bag was opened, but the final product, prepared according to directions, was smooth with a nice flavor.<br /><br />Liking our brew stronger, we made our second sample using more grind than called for in the directions. That time around we all detected a slight bitterness. One person called the aftertaste "chemically," despite Starbucks' assertion of all natural flavorings.<br /><br />The next day, we brewed a third batch in our preferred coffee maker, a french press. The vanilla flavor was more pronounced, but so was the bitterness. None of us finished our individual cups of the french press brewed batch. In Starbucks defense, using a press ignores their directions which specifically say to use a "machine," so we did not weigh this batch heavily in our rating.<br /><br />Overall, we agreed that it is drinkable, but not worth the premium price. Occasional drinkers of not very strong coffee would probably rate this product one star higher.

review/summary: Natural Flavoring
review/text: I enjoy my coffee, and have become rather picky about the coffee I drink.  Normally I avoid Starbucks coffees as I find them too dry.  Starbucks tends to roast coffee beans longer than most companies which reduces the oil content of the product.<br /><br />With the coming of the holiday season I decided to try this starbucks coffee.  I read that instead of using artificial flavoring they make the blend using actual vanilla beans.  Commercial coffee is usually flavored with artificial flavorings.  The ingredients in flavored coffees sometimes are associated with allergic reactions - especially when  propylene glycol is added.  Natural vanilla beans should not have an unhealthy reaction.<br /><br />I tried this coffee for several days.  When it was brewing I detected a slight vanilla aroma.  The coffee provided a pleasant taste, but I did not notice the vanilla.  Overall I rate this coffee above average but intend to return to coffee that is not flavored.

review/summary: Artificial aftertaste
review/text: I like vanilla flavored coffee and expected to like this.  I figured Starbucks would deliver premium quality for a premium price.  But, this coffee didn't pass the taste test.  It was a pretty mild vanilla flavor and a pretty weak coffee flavor, neither of which appealed to me.  Yet the worst aspect of this coffee was the kind of artificial flavor aftertaste.  I'm not sure if that's worth buying unless they figure out a better formula.

review/summary: Rich Tasting!
review/text: Starbucks' Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee sounded so good, I decided to order it when it was offered through the Vine program. And I'm so glad I did! It has a full, rich flavor, which is surprising considering that it is definitely less aromatic than similar vanilla products. In fact, one has to lean in close even to a just opened bag to get a whiff of the vanilla (which for those of us who enjoy the smell of coffee, and particularly flavored coffee, is a disappointment). However, once brewed, the vanilla flavoring comes across in just the right amount. On the second brewing, we (my husband and I) did decide to make it a bit stronger just for personal tastes, but this coffee is smooth and full even without the extra boost. Definitely a coffee we'd both recommend to lovers of flavored coffees!

review/summary: It's coffee and vanilla, how bad can it be?
review/text: I'm not sure exactly why I thought I'd like this Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee, since I usually find Starbucks coffee not to my taste. The ground coffee has a nice vanilla smell while it's still in the bag but my first sip was a huge disappointment--it tasted decidedly harsh. I tried brewing it stronger and weaker; still harsh, almost acidic. The only thing that made it drinkable was adding quite a bit of sugar, and I really don't care for my coffee that way.<br /><br />The ingredient list claims "ground vanilla beans," which I wouldn't expect to have a harsh acidic taste. Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world (after saffron) and grinding the beans is known to be a good way of dispersing the flavor through hot liquids. How can it have gone so wrong in this product? Is it the coffee itself that's so unappetizing, or the combination? I just don't know.<br /><br />From now on I'll look for vanilla in baked goods and body lotion, and keep it out of my coffee. Sorry, Starbucks, I'm not a fan of this brew.<br /><br />Two stars, not really for the coffee but to encourage Starbucks to do better with recycling and other green issues, and to increase fair trade initiatives.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010

review/summary: It's starbucks
review/text: On the plus side, it seems to be all natural ingredients, no fake stuff, such as it using real vanilla beans instead of flavoring. Having said that, I still feel like the vanilla flavor is too strong, and instead of being a nice accompaniment to the coffee, it almost overpowers the coffee itself. Beyond that, it is pre-ground and the beans, vacuum sealed, seemed to be as fresh as they could possibly be (couldn't smell it before opening it, therefore nice packaging).<br /><br />For those who knows what it is, we use an Aeropress coffee maker.<br /><br />The taste definitely has that "starbucks" flavor, which is a little more roasted than I would prefer, but if you like starbucks coffee, this does have that taste you'll recognize.<br /><br />Honestly, even though it wasn't horrible, I'm not a huge starbucks fan and it is pre-ground coffee (I am spoiled by freshly ground coffee). However, it is better than your every day instant coffee... it may sound a little negative, but it's not what I'm intending. It's not bad coffee; just not my cup of coffee.

review/summary: My favorite vanilla coffee, but its still vanilla coffee
review/text: As a die-hard Starbucks fanatic, I feel like its wrong to add flavorings to coffee.  This is the 3rd (and final) vanilla coffee I've tried over the last several months.  Ready for something new and different, vanilla seems a natural addition to coffee so it sounded worth trying.  This is definitely the best of the 3, (see my other reviews) for 2 primary reasons:  the coffee is better, and the vanilla is more subtle.<br />Made in a French press, according to the proportions advised on the side of the bag, Starbucks Natural Fusions produces a medium bold brew with a subtle, but not too sweet vanilla undertone.  The smell of vanilla is most pronounced upon opening the sealed foil bag.  After brewing, it is fairly subtle.  The coffee is smooth and not as acidic as some bolder brews I know and love.  The vanilla is enjoyable due to its lack of sweetness.<br />Overall, a fine cup of coffee, most suitable for drinking with dessert after dinner.  It has been my morning brew for a couple weeks, and I'm ready to return to Sumatra blend.  But for those who enjoy a flavored coffee, this one is highly recommended.

review/summary: Good Flavored Coffee
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee. I like Starbucks coffee. Given the opportunity to review Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla with other natural flavors, I was looking forward to giving it a try. Full disclosure, I like dark roast and am not generally fond of flavored coffees. However, I really like vanilla and wondered if a Starbucks flavored coffee would be superior to other brands I've tried.  I brewed up a pot a work and everyone who liked flavored coffees, really liked Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored ground coffee. It is a light flavor and the aroma is pleasant. For me, it still had that slightly chemically taste that I associate with flavored coffees and it wasn't a dark enough roast for me. I do think that this is a superior product to other flavored coffees I've tried.  I recommend it for people who like vanilla flavored coffee.<br /><br />The ingredients are Ground Coffee, Natural Flavor (with Corn Maltodextrin, Vegetable Glycerin), Ground Vanilla Beans, Indian sarsaparilla Root.  The package says 100% Responsibly grown. Ethically traded.

review/text: Taste: The taste was mild, not bitter. I enjoyed the infusion of vanilla flavoring, which wasn't too strong. All around good coffee.<br /><br />Serving sizes: I really didn't use a full suggested size of the grounds. I just don't like that strong of coffee. So each bag for me will produce around 100 cups.<br /><br />Cost: If you do the math, 100 cups of Starbucks barista prepared coffee is about $275 dollars compared to the $7.50 you paid for make it yourself option. I think it's self-evident what is the greater value in this matter.<br /><br />Summation: If you want a little variety in your daily coffee dose, and enjoy a moderately strong coffee, then this should be a given choice for you to make.

review/summary: Vanilla Flavored COFFEE, not Coffee Flavored Vanilla
review/text: A very nice flavored coffee. Too many coffees that are flavored suffer from the flavor overwhelming the taste of the coffee. This coffee has the hint of vanilla but does not block out the flavor of the coffee itself.<br />It is kind of like when you use the flavored creamers at a restaurant or coffee shop. Put in two or three of them and the flavoring of the creamer almost totally blocks out any coffee taste,<br />So if you want to achieve that hint of vanilla, I use a half of one container of the vanilla creamer and then a full container of plain creamer.<br />Same result, only the Starbuck's vanilla is a richer tasting vanilla that that used in creamers.<br />It is like the same difference between using Irish Cream flavored creamer versus using actual Bailey's in your coffee. One is very artificial and superficial while the other is rich and enhances the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />By the way, I rarely drink Starbuck's coffee because I don't like it. In fact I have never been in a Starbuck's but my Daughter and Granddaughter like their coffee and I have drunk coffee they have brought home from Starbuck's so I do know what their various flavors of coffee do taste like. So for me, this tastes like is a major improvement in their product.<br /><br />I do drink coffee and have probably drank thousands of gallons of it in my life, though I prefer tea, usually Tetley which I drink about four cups a day of. In fact I have my next 3 month supply of 400 bags being shipped by Amazon today because nobody sells it for less than they do.

I'll say right away that if you use as much coffee as they suggest, you'll probably end up using it to clean your counters.  Starbucks' suggestion of two tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 oz cup is more than twice what I settled on....... and I do like my coffee on the strong side.  The vanilla is very pleasing.. just enough flavor without overpowering the coffee.  This makes for a very nice mid-afternoon treat.

review/text: I find most "flavored" coffee to be sub-par coffee doused with some kind of perfumey scent so that hopefully you'll focus on how great it smells and won't notice how awful it tastes. This vanilla-infused coffee from Starbucks, however, is delicious. It's a good coffee with actual chunks of ground-up vanilla bean mixed in, so that when the hot water runs through your grounds, it brings a touch of vanilla with it. I've tried different combinations (1 part this coffee to 2 parts of my normal coffee) with good results.<br /><br />The best, however, was a cup of this coffee mixed with Bailey's Irish Cream. Divine, and highly recommended.

review/summary: Very Mildly Infused
review/text: This is a pleasant coffee, just be aware that it only very mildly infused in my opinion.<br /><br />Coffee is a very personal thing, some like strong bold flavors, deep roasts and powerful flavor notes.  Others prefer a more delicate palate.  This coffee very definitely fits that second description.<br /><br />The vanilla aroma, was noticeable when we opened the bag at home and the freshly brewed pot defintely gave off a pleasant vanilla scent.  That said, both experiences were mild, much milder than I have experienced with other vanilla coffees and light years away from what a vanilla flavored creamer would do to your cup of coffee. In fact I found that the vanilla notes were mild enough that they could be overpowered by sugar and cream. If you like your coffee this way, this is something to note.<br /><br />The coffee was also of a medium roast and milder than what Starbucks would call "bold" in their stores, and additionally milder than what I would call medium in their stores.  Not harsh or acidic as others have said, though bolder than what I normally drink in the morning.<br /><br />In summary, this is a pleasant coffee with medium roast character very very mild vanilla notes.  Recommended for those prefer a delicately flavored coffee with these characteristics.  For those searching for bolder notes, I would recommend looking elsewhere.

review/text: Not many Starbucks lovers who would say anything bad about Starbucks coffees, huh?  That's especially true of me.  This coffee smells wonderful when brewing in the kitchen.  The vanilla aroma spreads throughout the kitchen and makes everything smell good.  As its just before Christmas, I imagine the vanilla smelling a little Christmas-y.  The vanilla flavor comes out best, to my taste buds, with no flavored creamer, no plain creamer, and maybe 1/2 a teaspoon of sugar.  I tried a cup of it with Hazelnut flavored creamer and while I love that flavored creamer, it, of course, drowned out the subtle flavor of the vanilla coffee.  I recommend that drinkers of flavored coffee and those who like Starbucks try this coffee.  I give everything a grade and this vanilla flavored coffee from Starbucks is a solid "A".

Now, if you are a Starbuck's drinker and looking for a good 'out the door' coffee that will hold you until you get to your local Starbuck's store, then this coffee is a good choice.  I liken the Starbuck's bagged coffees versus the chain offerings to bottled Coca Cola versus fountain Coca Cola.  The former is fantastic and the latter is just okay.<br /><br />I actually found myself using a few more scoops of the bagged Natural Fusions coffee in an attempt to make it taste more like the original.  I guess if I didn't know how good the real thing was, I would have given this coffee at least 4 stars.  It's good, but not nearly as good as the real thing.  Is it better than other bagged choices out there?  Not as good as the best offerings, in my opinion, but better than most.

review/summary: Taste OK; Persistent After-taste
review/text: Preparation: I drink my coffee black.  I experimented with various strengths around the recommended measure.  Most of my preps were done in a French Press Pot, hoping that this would hold more of the volatile vanilla until it was served (vs a drip preparation).<br /><br />There was at most a very faint taste or smell of vanilla when drinking. In stronger preps, there was none. However, there is a persistent after-taste, part of which was the smell of vanilla and the other parts being coffee and something I couldn't characterize. At a normal strength brew, I didn't find the after-taste itself to be the problem, but rather its persistence (for hours).  In stronger brews, the drink and the after-taste had a prominent burnt and acidic taste (a characterization often used by non-fans of Starbucks).<br /><br />My _awareness_ of the after-taste declined significantly in subsequent days.  However, since a major use of flavored coffees is when entertaining, many of the drinkers won't be desensitized.<br /><br />The most pleasant part of the experience with this coffee was the smell while scooping it from the bag and disposing of the grounds--both had a pleasant vanilla smell.<br /><br />If it weren't for the persistent after-taste, I would have rated this 4-stars, being what you should expect relative to other coffees from Starbucks. Since how one views the good-ness of Starbucks-style coffee is a matter of personal taste and hence should be factored in by the reader, not by this reviewer.

review/text: I have sampled various types of Starbucks flavored coffee over the years, and I have found that Starbucks coffee, no matter what the flavor, is usually very consistent.  Upon opening the bag and brewing my first cup, I knew that Starbucks had a winner here.<br />I like my coffee strong; perhaps this comes from drinking it daily. In any event I found that the vanilla flavored Natural Fusions coffee produced a strong (but not bitter) cup of coffee. The vanilla is a nice balance to the bold Starbucks coffee and makes this a good coffee to drink both iced and hot. One thing I did notice, which I did not like, was a sweet aftertaste. The vanilla flavoring is not overwhelming, so I was surprised with the aftertaste. Of course taste is totally subjective, and others who drink this coffee may not notice, or be bothered, by the aftertaste.<br />Bottom line, I would certainly recommend this, especially if you like vanilla ground coffee.

You look at the sugar bowl but turn away as you want to savor the full flavor of this noble brew tinted with vanilla.  You finally succumb to temptation and each sip warms your body and excites your palate as you enjoy the perfect cup of morning bliss.<br /><br />Enjoy it I and my family did.  This is a full flavored coffee and the vanilla only adds an accent to it and is not overpowering at all.  I believe I saw some vanilla bean shavings among the grounds too so this is the real thing, not just an artificial flavoring.  While I don't purchased gourmet coffees like this for everyday use we do enjoy them on special occasions and the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla will be at the top of my list for Christmas and New Years Mornings.

review/summary: Liking the Starbucks at Home
review/text: I'm a Starbucks addict, but have never tried the ground coffee at home. I used less coffee than was indicated on the package since I'm not a fan of strong coffee, and was satisfied with the results. I cannot say it was the best coffee I've ever had, but the vanilla flavor was pleasant without being overpowering, and it had a smooth taste.

review/summary: Holy Bitter Coffee Batman!
review/text: I must begin by saying I love flavored coffee.  However, in my opinion, many flavored coffees tend to be terribly overpowering to the point where I typically brew my flavored coffee with a 50/50 mix of flavored coffee to regular coffee.  Normally I brew my coffee with 1 tablespoon of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water and use 1 packet of sugar per cup.<br /><br />I must admit that traditionally I am not a huge fan of Starbucks.  While they put out an excellent quality product, I think their beans tend to be over roasted.  However, I am the first to say it is still a decent cup of coffee.  So when I had the opportunity to try the Starbucks Natural Fusions line, I jumped on the chance.  When I received my bag of Starbucks Vanilla flavored coffee, I pulled out the coffee maker and brewed up a cup.<br /><br />The bouquet of the coffee grounds was a bit unusual.  There was a definite aroma of fine coffee beans, but there was an underlying odor that I can not place.  The ground coffee did not have a distinct vanilla aroma that I could detect.  The same was true with a brewed cup.  While there was a distinctive coffee scent, I still could detect the mystery scent which still did not smell like vanilla to me.<br /><br />The first sip resulted in an overpowering bitter flavor.  Having spent significant time in the Caribbean and South America, I am no stranger to the strong brewed coffees that are prevalent in some countries I have been to.  I am unsure of the source of the bitterness in the coffee (maybe the sarsaparilla root listed in the ingredients), but the bitter flavor was very significant.  The bitter flavor did become less noticeable with the more coffee I drank.  While I became accustomed to the bitterness, it never really went completely away.<br /><br />I really did not detect any vanilla flavor in the coffee, even when used at full strength.  In my opinion, the bitterness really detracts from any flavor of the coffee.  I am sure some people might love this aspect of the coffee, but for me it did not work.<br /><br />Overall, this did not seem to be a bad cup of coffee, but I just could not get past the overwhelming bitter flavor.  I would recommend this blend to people who like an intense, bitter flavor to their coffee.  If you prefer a milder cup of joe, then I would pass on this coffee.  I think this will be a wonderful product for the right person; however, that person just is not me.<br /><br />J. E. Nelson

review/summary: Personally, I would never buy it or recommend it to a friend...
review/text: Yes, I did smell the vanilla (and even saw it) when I opened the bag and pour the contents out. However, once the coffee was made, the taste was a disappointment to myself. Perhaps I got used to another coffee which was much more to my liking. In any case, not only did this coffee taste bitter to me, but the vanilla taste was weaker than I expected (again, this is in comparison to another vanilla-flavored coffee I've had, which gave me a stronger vanilla "experience"). This Starbucks product is pretty strong coffee (the instructions tell you to use 2 TBS of ground coffee for 6 ounces of water) and to my taste - seems quite bitter if I follow their instructions. However, once I add some milk to it, the bitterness is masked somewhat - but I would not drink this black if I have a choice. Personally, I would not buy it myself or recommend this product to a friend.

review/summary: Tasty, Fairly Bold Coffee w/ Wonderful Aroma & Not Too Sweet!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by this coffee.  What I expected was an overly sweet coffee with a light roast whose natural coffee flavor was overwhelmed by vanilla.  (As a disclaimer, I normally DO NOT like flavored coffees, nor do I like sweeteners in my coffee).  Instead, what I found was a relatively bold roast (but not overly so!), nuanced with a wonderful vanilla aroma & flavor.  I enjoyed it both black & with a little bit of milk, depending on my mood.  The aroma was perhaps the best attribute of this coffee, filling the kitchen with its wonderful scent.  Highly recommended for coffee & vanilla lovers!

review/text: We've long been fans of Starbucks  coffees, but this is undoubtedly now our top favorite.<br /><br />  The coffee, of course, is the usual Starbucks quality -  tops.  You know you're having a cup of coffee.  The vanilla is a subtle added  flavor, giving just a hint of that delicious taste.  It never overpowers as some  flavored coffees do, but simply makes you want to come back for more.<br /><br />  We're enjoying this coffee, and will be back for  more.<br /><br />  One slight caveat the description said "Pack of 2" - we received just one.

review/summary: Subtle, not over-powering vanilla flavored coffee that's smooth and delicious
review/text: I'm usually not a fan of flavored coffees but I do have a weakness for all things vanilla.  So I decided to try out a bag of Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored coffee. I brew all of my coffee in a vintage early 1960s Revere Ware Vintage Percolator.  When I brew up a pot of this coffee, the aroma that fills the kitchen isn't overpowering like some other vanilla-flavored coffees I have tried in the past are. Very subtle but still distinct.<br /><br />This coffee is very strong, however (which I like) and so may not be for everyone. I tend to add a generous amount of half-and-half and sugar, which in my opinion makes this coffee one of my favorites. I particularly enjoy a cup after a big dinner, with pie and ice cream. Heaven!

review/summary: No vanilla taste.
review/text: I really thought this would be delicious.  Starbucks coffee usually tastes great and I love vanilla flavored anything.  First off, when opening the bag I didn't smell vanilla.  At all.  The coffee grounds were large and uneven looking.  Sort of odd to me.  I brewed a pot, still no vanilla smell, and there was no vanilla taste at all.  There was some sort of odd, bitter taste, almost as if the coffee was old or something.  Hard to describe, but it was kind of musty tasting! I tried two more pots just to be sure before I gave up on this.  I even gave my coffee maker a good cleaning, but it was the coffee itself, not the maker.  I ended up throwing the rest of the bag away.  Very disappointing.

review/text: This Starbucks coffee is delicious. For pre-ground coffee, the beans are very fresh compared to other brands. This coffee has a very aromatic vanilla flavor with a hint of sweetness. It has that familiar Starbucks kick to get you going in the morning. Goes perfect with a croissant or delicate morning pastry.  Now if Starbucks offered this is certified organic coffee, I'd be in coffee-lovers Heaven.

review/summary: Bitter
review/text: I have to say at the outset that I'm generally not partial to flavored coffees. I prefer my coffee without added tastes.<br /><br />I prepared the Starbucks Vanilla Flavored in a Cuisinart drip-machine per the instructions on the package - 10 grams of coffee to each 6 ounces of water. I used a Melitta brown paper filter. I found the brewed coffee extremely bitter and not very flavorful. I experimented with varying the coffee/water ratio to try to get a better result, but was unsuccessful.<br /><br />I'm convinced that brewing coffee is one of the "dark arts" and that's why I give this Starbucks 3 stars rather than 1 or 2. My experience may be the result of the way I made the coffee, my machine, my water, my filter, my tastebuds or some combination of these.

review/text: If you like Starbucks coffee, you will probably like the vanilla flavored version quite well; the vanilla is quite noticeable, but not too strong, and very fragrant and pleasant. If, like me, you find Starbucks coffee to have a burned flavor, then this is better than some Starbucks blends, but it still has the signature burnt-popcorn undertone. To each his own, I say!

review/summary: It's "natural" for a reason.
review/text: I'm usually one to try new coffee flavors, though vanilla is definitely one of my favorites. So, I was more than happy to see what Starbucks meant by "Natural Fusions".<br /><br />As it turns out, the branding is pretty accurate.<br /><br />Rather than an overpowering candy-like vanilla that you'd get by using a flavored creamer, or most store-brand flavored coffees, Starbucks Natural Fusions tastes almost like they package a couple of vanilla beans in with plain coffee. The flavor and aroma are definitely present, but it's really much more like their House Blend with a touch of something extra.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice "anytime" brew that doesn't fight cream and sugar, and doesn't have the harsh aftertaste that's often present in Starbucks blends.

review/summary: Met expectations, sadly.
review/text: Nice packaging.  Makes one imagine rich vanilla flavor -- upon opening, this just smells rather thin, a sense reinforced when actually brewed.  VERY thin vanilla flavor.  I'd say delicate, but a more appropriate term would be weak.<br /><br />But the coffee isn't weak:  if you're into Starbucks' fare, this won't disappoint.  Since I'm not into Starbucks' fare (I subscribe to the narrative that they've hoodwinked the country into blithely accepting the fallacy that strong, acidic/bitter coffee is Primo, which it isn't), I wasn't surprised by the rather nasty aftertaste that not even 3-4 sugars per cup can mask.<br /><br />I love strong coffee, but good coffee can be strong and not offensively acidic with a bite at the end of the quaff that can peel taste-buds off.  It's all in the beans and the roast.  I don't know why Starbucks foists off fare like this on the public; oh, yes I do -- because it sells to those who don't know better.<br /><br />And, I see we're down to 11 (yes, ELEVEN) oz. "pounds" of coffee.  Why send 2 packages of 11 oz. (2 x 11 = 22), when one could just put it all into a true "pound and a half" 24 oz. bag?  It just makes no sense, the packaging costs are higher, and it's hardly more environmentally friendly this way.<br /><br />When I tell people I used to live in Seattle, they frequently say, "OH, you must have gone to Starbucks all of the time."  "Only when I had no other choice," is my response.  If one is willing to pay boutique prices for coffee, one can do FAR better.  In fact, even if one is NOT willing to pay boutique prices for coffee....

review/text: I am so happy with this coffee! I really enjoy vanilla flavored coffee, but so many of them have an artificial flavor and have a "fake" aftertaste. The whole concept of the Natural Fusions is definitely accurate. Great taste, nothing artificial, and the flavor is really subtle, so you're not bombarded with a sweet taste.<br /><br />I am really impressed with this one and will be trying out other Natural Fusion flavors.

review/summary: Starbucks Natural Fusions Not for me........
review/text: I am a HUGH Coffee Fan. I also drink teas but coffees are my favorite....and I have had coffees from all over at one time or another.<br /><br />This particular coffee--Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla  Coffee was right up my alley or at least I thought.<br /><br />Starbucks in known around the world.....and I know many people flock to the stores in enjoy it. Thus my desire to try this form out.<br /><br />The packaging of this coffee and the coffees'  form itself is excellent. Packaging is airtight yet rather easy to handle open and close---having both the "tape " closure and the side tabs.<br /><br />My issue here was the taste of the coffee itself.<br /><br />When one thinks Vanilla  Flavored Coffee it is a gentle feeling...a tasteful feeling....and instead with this you get the feeling of being beaten with a baseball bat. Hughly over caffeinated heavily dark , dense almost bitter tasting  coffee infused with a minisclue amount of Vanilla and other flavorings .<br /><br />The Vanilla flavor barely makes it through the first cup of coffee---and certainly not to the end of the brewed pot.<br /><br />They do not mention the actual beans used here though on the package they mention a "accent" of vanilla.<br /><br />Well , what ever they are using for me is just NOT enough. Furthermore...the taste of the base coffee used in this mix is simply way too strong for a delicate flavor as is Vanilla.<br /><br />The caffeine level is enough to give you a headache.<br /><br />Now as usual I must say that another person  that enjoys those heavy , dark ,  dense coffees may very well enjoy this one...but for me..................well.......its just not my cup of coffee.

That wouldn't be a big deal if this had more flavor, but it just doesn't.<br /><br />Skip it and go for the cheap stuff.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: This coffee has a strong vanilla aroma, but the flavor in the cup is not strong at all; in fact, it's barely noticeable, just kind of a highlight.  This is a fairly smooth, mellow cup of coffee, if you're careful to use the right amount in the brewing.  However, I always find that Starbucks coffees have a sort of burnt edge to the flavor, as if the beans were over-roasted, and this one is no exception.  I also have a commitment to purchasing fair trade, sustainably grown, bird-friendly coffee, and Starbucks does not qualify on any of those counts.  I'm not downgrading the coffee for this -- the 3-star rating is based just on the flavor -- but since Starbucks does not meet these expectations, it's not a brand I will choose in the future for a regular coffee.
