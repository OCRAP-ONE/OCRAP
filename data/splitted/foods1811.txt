review/summary: Real green tea
review/text: I always like to drink real Japanese green tea that is true green in color. I have found this product to be just that. Delicate flavor and packaging it has all the antioxidant effects - truely.  Although a little pricey, you do get what you pay for.

review/summary: I've never had Matcha before but I didn't really care for this tea
review/text: Someone told me I should start drinking green tea because it's good for you.  So I tried some Bigelow Green Tea which I thought tasted very good and kinda gave me a little lift.  Then I read an article about how the matcha green tea was supposed to be even healthier for you so I thought I would try the Kirkland brand especially since it had so many good reviews.  Well, I didn't like the taste of it as much as I did the Bigelow.  It's not bad, I just prefer the taste of the other green tea better.  Getting through this box and then going back to the Bigelow.  I didn't feel any different as far as I can tell other than I didn't feel that little lift.  And I figure might as well drink what I like.  Maybe the matcha is better for you, maybe it does taste better than regular green tea to green tea connoisseurs, maybe I have weird tastebuds, I just prefer the Bigelow.

review/summary: One of the Best Green Teas
review/text: I am new to green tea and was at first skeptical about buying a japanese authentic matcha. But this match-green tea blend turned out to be perfect in all ways. The matcha powder doesn't overwhelm you with any kind of bitterness. I reuse my bag 3-4 times before throwing it away and believe me it's enjoyable until the last sip. I have shared this will all my colleagues and everyone seemed to have liked it very much. This is a must try for all green tea enthusiasts.

review/text: I love this Tea<br />This is  better than any I have found in the store ,great flavor ,very smooth. It also very easy to make requires no steeping and the tea bags are only needed to set for a minute. It was a big hit with my tea friends and created a buzz at my Tai Chi studio. We have a tea rack where the Sifu (instructor) keeps his stash of favorite tea which he and the other instructors drink constantly. I snuck 20 bags in without telling anyone came back 2 days later and was gone .I was asked about it before class and confessed , all claimed it was some of the best tea they have had. I took them some more and we are looking  into buying some other flavors as well.

review/summary: Some of the best!
review/text: I'm a member of Costco, who owns the Kirkland brand, so I just bought it there instead because it's cheaper (if you're a member.)  I've had some of the most expensive green tea one can buy in my area ($20/oz hand-picked Gyokuro.)  This, while not being $20/oz gyokuro, is not too terribly far from it.  The quality for this price point is, so far as I've ever experienced, unmatched.  And quite honestly, it's the best tea-bagged green tea I've ever tasted.  I'll drink it as long as they keep selling it. :)

review/summary: Great! But NOT for super finicky cats
review/text: Wanted to love Vita Gravy with an older, HIGHLY quirky, highly finicky cat about everything, one with mood swings and who's probably lost her mind. Despite this cat loving gravy more than wet food she completely ignored/turned up her nose at this product, wouldn't go near it. The other cats, however, this was like smack to them and they couldn't wait for another hit, but mind you they didn't need it as I was buying this because the one finicky cat was refusing to eat. In short it's great for most cats and I'm sure it's a good product, that said, if you're buying this as a last resort because you have a choosey cat who's not eating don't buy bulk, try one and see if it'll work.

If anyone knows of a vitamin gravy that cats LOVE, I'd really like to know about it. I feel bad giving something a poor review, but it's not coming from me, it's coming from my cat. If it helps take the sting off, my possum likes it...but he can only have very tiny amounts due to their strict dietary requirements. I'll give it 3 stars since the possum was interested.

review/summary: Vitagravy Saved My Cat's Life!
review/text: Our cat Oskar is 16+ years old. We don't know exactly how old, he was estimated by the vet to be about 3 years old when my wife got him 14 years ago.<br /><br />About 18 months ago we thought he was going to die when he became quite sick. The vet didn't hold out much hope for him and we aren't really in a position to spend a ton of money on tests and medication to extend the life of an already quite old house cat. We brought him home, resigned that it was really just a matter of time and we would do what we could to keep him comfortable.<br /><br />We decided to give Vitagravy a shot after seeing it in a local pet store. We mix a few drops in his food every day. His improvement was visible and steady from the second or third day.<br /><br />Today, Oskar looks and acts like a much younger cat. People who see him are amazed to learn that he is nearly old enough to vote. I think without a regular dose of Vitagravy, he would have passed months ago.

review/summary: What the heck is "vegetarian salmon flavor broth"?
review/text: It's the main ingredient in this supposedly "no artificial flavors" product for cats. Cats aren't vegetarians! And they don't recognize this stuff as food, either. There's no meat or meat protein in this weirdly pink-colored, all vegetables and fruits, non-cat-friendly goop. Mine just looked at me funny and walked away when I offered it to them. Google this and check the ingredients list before you buy this for your cat--and then don't.

review/summary: Cats say "No Thanks"
review/text: I bought two different flavors of Vita gravy, and I couldn't get either of my cats to even take a lick of them, despite how I served them. I tried to put some on their dry food, they actually didn't eat for hours until I replaced it with just dry food. I tried offering it up solo, to no avail. And I put some on a bit of lettuce, but they still wouldn't take the bait.<br /><br />I imagine it smells like plastic to them, but both my cats don't go near it after smelling Vita Gravy. I can understand Allstar not liking it - he's... special (which is why I call him "Allstar"). He's squeamish and weird and he only eats his regular food in small portions throughout the day; never more than a couple of bites at once. If I offer him wet food, he just licks the gravy from that and leaves the meaty portion to Agnes.<br /><br />Agnes, on the other hand, is a 20 lb vacuum. I've had to pull string out of her anus because she ingested it and couldn't quite push it out of herself. Come to think of it, she doesn't mind chewing on plastic either, so I'm not sure what about Vita Gravy is so unappetizing to her, especially considering what I've shared.<br /><br />I don't know if other cats go for it, but I have two VERY different cats of my own and neither will eat Vita Gravy. My advice: Bad buy.

review/summary: My cat ate it eventually
review/text: I purchased the salmon flavor for my cat who needed to increase her liquid intake. Initially she wanted nothing to do with it, but eventually she got used to it. I just put a small squirt on her favorite wet food. I wouldn't say she goes nuts for the stuff, but at least she doesn't mind it. But, I can't say that the vitamin aspect of the gravy seems to have had much of an affect. Maybe her coat is a little glossier, but she's generally better groomed in summer anyway. The good news is she's getting a little bit more of the liquid she needs, but this is still only a so-so product at best since cats don't really like it.

review/text: I bought two 17.6 oz cans.  Both are marked with 12/2010 packing date and 12/2012 expiration date.  This coffee is absolutely bland, nothing like Effendi I have had before this order, from a different vendor.  Either it was stale before it was canned or there might be another possible explanation.  The text on either can is in Turkish and German.  The same brand bought before, from a different vendor, was in Turkish and English.  Perhaps, for German market, it is supposed to be bland but I doubt it.  The largest Turkish community outside of Turkey would not drink this stuff.<br /><br />I got full refund from Amazon.<br /><br />I strongly recommend to buy your Mehmet Effendi from another vendor and to make sure the text on the can is in Turkish and English.

review/summary: The real thing.
review/text: (This review is very similar to one I did for another brand.)<br /><br />Let me start by saying that, while not a snob or connoisseur, I have tried just about every method of making coffee known to humanity. Drip, perk, pump and steam espresso, Aeropress, Neopolitan, Canadian-made coffee bags, Toddy concentrate and everything but pan boiled with eggshells. I've ground my own beans and even roasted them in small quantities. (I must have been an alchemist in a previous time!) Most of my gear (La Pavoni espresso machine, Capresso pump machine, Capresso conical grinder, countless Bialetti pots, Revereware stainless drippers, etc.,) have come from fortunate thrift store finds.<br /><br />My interest in Turkish style coffee came about with the purchase (online auction-used) of an ASTOUNDING Turkish-made fully electronic, sensor controlled masterpiece of an automatic maker from Beko which is even easy to clean! It has won awards from CeBIT, the world's largest and most international computer expo. Atat&uuml;rk would be proud!<br /><br />I found that my grinder could produce very close to the powder-like nature of ground Turkish coffee. But I wanted to try "the real thing," so I ordered this brand and another. This brand is from Turkey and comes in an attractive almost collectable metal can.<br /><br />My biggest surprise was that the coffee is not as dark roasted as what I had used before. But very pleasant with (traditionally) sugar or without.<br /><br />If you have a local coffee supplier with the gear to REALLY grind down to Turkish style, you are in luck. If not, give this a try. Standard stove-top boiler pots are cheap, but the Bekos are not. As all coffee tends to come from the same sources, I suspect I will be able to find similar quality locally, grind it or have it ground, and store it in this can.  Makes it easy to spot the Turkish grind!

review/summary: Wonderful, Rich Body...Love the caffeine.
review/text: This is, without a doubt, the best Turkish Coffee I have ever tried.  Very sophisticated taste.  Unfortunately, I am not a coffee connoisseur.  But I prefer this to anything made at Starbucks, Peetes or Diedrichs.  If you love the taste of coffee and haven't tried any Turkish Coffee before, this is the genuine article.  I just brew mine in a simmering pot over the stove.  No fancy gizmos.  Not that I wouldn't love to try to make it in one of those tiny pots, but my house is filled with every Ronco infomercial kitchen appliance since 1989 and I don't have any more room.  Plus, its like 3 of those pots to one of my coffee cups.  Finally, this stuff lasts forever and a day. It should take me a month or two to finish it.

review/text: It is one of the best Turkish coffee available!  I love Turkey and went there twice.  Every time I was there, I always ordered their cai (tea) or Mehmet Efendi Coffee.  I'm so glad that it is available from Amazon.com<br /><br />There is a little tips in brewing Turkish or Greek coffee.<br /><br />1) Use filtered water if possible.  It does make a difference.<br /><br />2) Use medium high heat.<br /><br />3) When you place the pot on the stove, ensure you don't over boil it.  After it is boiled for 1-2 minutes, the coffee should have very tiny-bubbled foam.  If you have BIG bubbles - you are over boiling it. Turn down the temperature.<br /><br />4) Once the tiny-bubbled foam starts to rise up, remove it from the stove and spoon the foam into you cup.  Within seconds, place it back to the stove and continue to boil it w/medium to medium high heat.  After 10-15 seconds, your coffee is ready to be served. To me, the tiny-bubbled foam makes the coffee smoother.<br /><br />It takes a few good trys to make a perfect cup - Enjoy!

review/summary: Acquired taste
review/text: I am an avid coffee drinker and have tried many different types of coffee. I had Turkish coffee many times except my friend always ground her own and I liked the flavor of her coffee. I was grinding my own coffee and preferred the taste over this Turkish  coffee. While this coffee is ground to perfection and was not expired ( it actually has another year and a half) as well as packaged in a great canister that easily fits in the refrigerator , My taste buds are not adjusting to the flavor. Mehmet Efendi Turkish Coffee has a very earthy almost topsoil earthy flavor. Not that I've tasted topsoil but the smell of topsoil is how this coffee tastes to me. That's about as good as I can explain it. Like I stated earlier it is an acquired taste and I am in no way stating it is terrible coffee but before you purchase this consider buying your own favorite coffee bean and grinding it to a fine powder. I use the magic bullet to grind my coffee beans and it works great.

review/summary: YUM.
review/text: As a green tea obsessee- I've tried MANY, many kinds of green tea. From Korea, China, Japan, etc etc.<br />I think the best I ever had was a super highend green tea from China that cost $80 for a small pouch.<br />Except I'm not made of money, so this is my review of obsessing over a good-priced green tea:<br /><br />I judge the quality of the tea leaves by 3 things.<br />1. How the tea tastes when steeped in hot water.<br />2. How many cups a tea bag can be used in hot water before completely using flavor.<br />3. If the tea is able to steep in room temperature water.<br /><br />Onwards:<br />1. Tazo's China Green Tips is definitely one of the best teas I've had steeped in hot water. If you oversteep it, there's a slight tangy bitterness that comes with all green teas. Except this tea has the least harsh tangy/bitter feel to it. Even if you burn the leaves from boiling water, it's still drinkable (unlike poorer quality green teas, the tang/bitterness is like some kind of horrible challenge).<br />2. I've been able to yank 2 cups of tea, with completely full flavor in each one. I steep my bags in hot water for 3 minutes max and take them out. I've been trying to decrease my caffeine intake, so I like to re-use the bag for another 2 weak cups, just to drink in the flavor without opening a new bag.<br />3. This steeps in room temperature water! 1 bag steeped in room temperature water will start to show very nice green in your cup after even 3 minutes. I drink my teas like this in the summer, since I can't stand drinking boiling hot tea in 100F. The taste will obviously not be as strong as when it's steeped in hot water, but it's still lovely and perfect for the summer.<br /><br />For those who said they found this product at Target for cheaper, I saw that too. But I noticed on the tea bags sold in Target that it's stamped with Tazo's 2007 rights, while the tea bags sold from here (or at least the last batch I bought 6 months ago) were stamped with Tazo's 2008 rights. So. I guess. Maybe Target is selling older stock, hence why it's cheaper?

review/summary: Good and so very close to loose leaf chinese green tea.
review/text: I became accustomed to chinese green tea while on vacation to China. Drinking fresh loose leaf tea everyday was a pure pleasure so I even went to the extent of buying chinese green teas being imported. Then one day at work, I had run out and I found we had Tazo China Green Tips tea. Lo and behold, it has the same flavor, essence and aroma as the tea I had been drinking in China. The flavor is good and the tea bag seeps well, it's not as bold as the loose leaf version by Tazo sold in tins but it does the job and for the price on the bulk 6 pack of 24, it's a pretty good deal.  I buy the loose leaf version of the Tazo China Green Tips at Starbucks for under 7 dollars a box, which are actually tins. Love this tea for the convenience and being so close to loose leaf versions of the tea. As the other reviewer noted, don't seep too long otherwise it gets bitter. I like the perfect seep where it has the nutty undertones, fresh aromatic vapors. Conveniently on Amazon for a 6 pack of 24.

review/summary: Bold black tea, just as good as the tea bag version
review/text: If you enjoy the bold black tea Awake made by Tazo, you're going to love it just as much in these super convenient K-Cups. You get the exact same great strong flavor as you do from using the tea bags. I like my tea strong, and I find I can actually make about 1 and a half mugs of tea from each of these K-Cups, and still get a good strength. Another cheaper option is simply buying a box of the Tazo Awake tea bags and just use your Keurig to make the hot water for your tea, then just add a tea bag to it. But if you like using the K-Cups, you will be happy with the cup of tea these produce. I've used up about half of one of these boxes so far, and only once did I end up with any tea leave in my cup. There were just a few, and it only happened one time so far, so I think it's not that common an occurrence. It didn't affect the cup of tea at all, I just always check to see when I'm trying out new K-Cups how clear of a drink they produce. In all, Tazo has produced a better of a cup of tea than I've brewed from other brands of K-Cups, such as Twinings Earl Grey, which came out cloudy and weak.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the taste of this blend, it's a strong black tea with no real flavors to speak of. There's no citrus, no sweetness, nothing like that. If I was to compare it to coffee, it would be like a basic, black coffee with nothing added to it. Because of it's simple taste, this is a great anytime tea and a great replacement for coffee.

review/summary: A bold black tea
review/text: This tea is somewhere between an English Breakfast Tea and the bolder Irish Breakfast Tea.  As with all K-cups, you can adjust the strength by selecting a cup size to your liking.  I found it to be a bit bitter on the smaller sizes and have found I prefer it at the 4th setting on my B-70 Platinum brewer.<br /><br />What is added to tea is personal preference, I like mine with a little sweetener but no milk or cream.  It is a satisfying tea but I really don't understand the "Awake" in the name.  I typically will drink tea in the late evening since it doesn't provide the same stimulus that coffee does for me.<br /><br />While good to try, I think I will probably continue to buy the more typical and less expensive "Breakfast Teas" in the future.

Unfortunately on the web the distributors send this expensive product in several boxes, each time the price of shipping double price. In NYC you find the product at Citarella for about $14. If you use the web the price is more than 100% with shipping. The product is superb, but I think the exclusif distribution take advantage of their position, I advise you not to buy on the web.

review/text: I love this stuff!  Not only is it delicious, it's also super low on sugar and all-organic.  It's the best of all worlds!<br /><br />How can I explain the flavor?  It's just downright... pleasant.  The blueberry flavor comes through beautifully, supported by hints of the grape and cane juices.  I can pick up a little bit of pomegranate flavor in the aftertaste as well, but it's definitely understated.  Most of all, I am impressed by the sweet taste that rides with you from start to finish.<br /><br />Given, it is not exactly a miraculous feat for a company to produce a sweet-tasting drink.  However, it is VERY impressive when said company manages to produce a sweet-tasting drink with only 14 grams of sugar per serving!  That's about half the sugar of Coca Cola. And no artificial sweeteners, to boot.  AND much of that sugar comes from natural fruit juice, which comes from local organic farmers.<br /><br />Seriously, it works for me on every level: perfect sweetness, balanced flavor, low sugar, real fruit, organic, and possibly magical.  Highly recommended!!

The cast are great in this movie as they all seem to give a 110% into their characters and while for obvious reasons some of the effects will seem dated they will still make you give a laugh as y see the hijinx of Beetlejuice in action.

review/summary: BEETLEJUICE..A TIM BURTON CLASSIC!
review/text: [[ASIN:B001AGXEAG Beetlejuice (20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)]<br /><br />Beetlejuice, the Tim Burton classic from 1988 now comes to you packaged as a 20th Anniversary DVD edition.  Michael Keaton, I think in one of his best film performances brings down the house.  Also starring Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, two actors you would have never thought to put together in a movie of this genre, it is classic comedy at its best.  The DVD also has special features, although nothing to make your head spin, but it offers several episodes of the cartoon series from the late 1980's.  But beyond that, nothing too spectacular; not that it needs that much more. A simple classic comedy that if it doesn't make you laugh, something is wrong with you and you should be exorcised!  With that being said, buy it if you don't own it. It's a must have dark comedy.

review/summary: One of Tim Burton's best movies
review/text: Beetlejuice one of Tim Burton's best movies he has done during the 1990's.  I enjoy this movie loads and watch it time and time again.  I never get tired of the movie no matter how many times I watch the movie Beetlejuice.  The actors did such an amazing job and musical score perfect timing on the exact scenes.  But if you love a good comedy movie and talented actors and a very talented director then pick this movie up and enjoy laugh after laugh time and time again.

review/text: How can you not love watching BeetleJuice.  Michael Keaton is at his very very best, and Alec Baldwin is fun to watch in a younger slimmed down early days role.  My favorite is actualy Geena Davis...she is an amazing actress that just controls the screen with her natural abilities and little effort involved.  The Movie is GREAT in Blu-ray...as usual!

review/summary: A Really Bizarre Spectacle. Classic Tim Burton.
review/text: For last night's movie, I though I'd try something a little different. I had a copy of "Beetlejuice" which I picked off the bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store. It was a Tim Burton movie. Hmmmm. Tim Burton has turned out some really weird movies and some of them I haven't particularly cared for. Well, "Beetlejuice" was weird, all right, but it was also funny in a bizarre fashion. For example, how could you set up an attractive and enjoyable couple and then make their death by automobile accident funny? Well, they did it and it involved a small dog. Or how could you have a movie dwelling on death and the thereafter and have an underworld waiting room of dead people being processed to their next place. Oh, and with an incompetent staff. It's bizarre! And funny. Especially the dismembered lady who was in two parts sitting side by side or the guy with the shrunken head. What kind of people dream this kind of stuff up? Keep on alert when watching a Tim Burton movie, for a lot of the humor is strictly visual. You'll see some of the strangest things, including visual puns.<br /><br />In any case, a delightful young newly-married couple were fixing up an old New England manor, but had a fatal automobile accident nearby. Their ghosts (which could be seen by no one) returned to their house, but were confined to the home and could not go outside. Of course, the house was eventually sold and a new couple, together with a goth teenage girl, moved in. The ghosts tried everything to scare the new intruders away but with negative results. Finally, they enlisted the services of Beetlejuice, a renegade ghost himself, and somewhere along the line, the ghost couple made friends with the goth teenager, who was able to see them. Well, this story has so many weird twists and turns I couldn't possibly keep it straight. It's about the most strangely unfolding plot I can ever remember seeing.<br /><br />I found the movie interesting, somewhat humorous and somewhat enjoyable. Most certainly, it was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny. However, I'm just not into the supernatural and the afterlife and things of that sort, so I probably missed a lot of the subtle humor that would be picked up by people who are so immersed. The movie is complex enough and fast moving so I'd have to watch it several times in order to pick up on all the subtle twists and turns. It's classic Tim Burton, I'll say that.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Meanwhile, the old country house is sold to trendy New Yorkers that entertain unwelcome changes to its charm.<br /><br />The Maitlands want them out, but have difficulty scaring the New Yorkers. So, their 'afterlife' case worker suggests hiring a bio-exorcist, Beetlejuice (played by Michael Keaton), to do the job.<br /><br />The New Yorker's daughter (played by Winona Ryder) serves as mediator and plays a strong supporting role.<br /><br />These words best describe the direction of Tim Burton:<br />"Know what they say about people that commit suicide? In the after life, they become civil servants."<br /><br />This flick is entertaining and worth the price.

review/summary: Fun Then, Fun Now; Blu-Ray An Upgrade
review/text: This movie always was: 1 - very popular; 2 - very different; 3 - very entertaining; 4 - a very fast-moving hour-and-a-half of a film.  It now IS available on Bllu-Ray and it looks better; nothing outstanding, but a definite improvement in shapnress.<br /><br />Several characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton's unique and sometimes- revolting title character "Beetlejuice"- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..<br /><br />It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the '90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who many times has  played nice people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now, she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife/mother of a family who moves into a "haunted house" inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.<br /><br />Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.<br /><br />Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife. However, I just chalk it up to someone just trying to make a fun, entertaining picture and on that, it succeeds.<br /><br />Overall, a unique and entertaining film. It's different, to say the least!

The afterlife concept of the film is excellent as well as entertaining; this film is a must for your video library... It's to be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The casting for this film is perfect, Michael Keaton is the outrageously funny and whacky witted (Betelguese - the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist) with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis playing (Adam and Barbara Maitland), a young couple that die prematurely. Adding to the cast are Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara (as Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter Winona Ryder (as Lydia).<br /><br />One of the most hilarious scenes is the dinner party accompanied by Harry Belafonte's Banana Boat song `Day-O'.  This is truly Tim Burton at his finest taking the significance of being dead and dousing it with humor.

review/summary: Tim Burton's imagination goes wild!
review/text: I'd have to say that this isn't really a top favorite from master filmmaker Tim Burton, but it's not at all horrible. It's a classic display of Burton's wild imagination and clever imagery. It's a great comedy, and it's not only Burton's directing that makes it a laughfest. Michael Keaton is perfect as Beetlejuice; I don't think no one else can equally play the character like he does. But it's too bad he only appears in the film in a total of ten minutes. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis shine as the deceased married couple, who want an eccentric family out of their perfect house. Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder give nice performances, and Robert Goulet's cameo appearance is a treat.<br /><br />Oh, and let's not forget Danny Elfman's music score. This is awe-inspiring pre-Batman stuff right here; the main theme is VERY catchy. Art direction and costume design are a plus. The only flaw I can find here is the dance sequence in the end of the film. It's pretty corny, and I find it very annoying. But overall, this is a fun film for the older crowd.

review/text: "It keeps getting funnier every time I see it,"  says Beetlejuice, the mischievous ''bioexercist'' of the title who is superbly played by Michael Keaton. And this quote pretty much sums up how I feel about the movie, especially the famous dinner party scene. The premise of the movie is great, the score is memorable, and the acting from the entire cast is just about perfect. I highly recommend this film, which is often tagged as a ''Halloween movie,'' but can really be enjoyed at ANY time of the year.

review/summary: Macabre Fun For the Whole Family
review/text: "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" was director Tim Burton's first film but "Beetlejuice" was the film that made people take notice as to what an original talent he is.  Think about it.  Who else could have made death so much fun?  The script by Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell may deal with the departed but it's fresh and original with ideas deliciously from left field.  I particularly liked the waiting room for the recently departed and the case worker played by Sylvia Sidney.  Bo Welch's art direction is highly imaginative as is the Oscar winning make-up effects.  Michael Keaton's ribald renegade bio-exorcist plays like a deceased stand-up comedian.  I couldn't tell which parts of Keaton's schtick was scripted or improvised.  This also the film that heralded Winona Ryder as a talent to be reckoned with and hopefully soon again.  An unqualified success.

review/summary: burton's best?
review/text: Tim Burton's fantastic vision of life after death.Michael Keaton plays one of the best characters in film to the hilt and should have not been forgotten.Winona Ryder plays the goth-type daughter of Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones all who are great in their roles.The story though is based upon a couple,played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis,who drown in a car accident and struggle with the after life and the new owners of their beloved home.The movie is dark,especially when Baldwin and Davis have to go to the head of the dead to find out how to get rid of the new owners.It's interesting how those that have died tragically have to spend the after life working.Harry Belafontes music is put to good use in 2 big scenes.Definitely one of Burton's best works that should not be missed.

review/summary: aging classic
review/text: dudes, you can't argue that there's some iconic sh** in this flick.  the characters are all killer, winona rocks in her day, and the b-juice is one of the ultiimate onscreen personas of all time.  wicked.  funny.  the scenes in the death waiting room are a scream.  for an old flick, this is good eatin.  i'm out.  j.

review/summary: Another Twisted Masterpiece From Burton
review/text: Here's the plot of 1988's "Beetlejuice", significantly simplified:<br /><br />A young couple who've recently died find that another family is moving into their house. They must haunt their home and drive the family away, but find it nearly impossible to do. So, new to the afterlife and oblivious to the danger involved, they seek assistance from the kooky bio-exorcist Beetlejuice to help them freak the new family out. But the spirit realm's menace of a ghost has some choatic plans of his own.<br /><br />As for some of the cast and crew:<br /><br />Tim Burton as a director has almost always succeeded in delivering spectacular films, and this is no exception. His strange visual style is mesmerizing as usual. Danny Elfman's theme (as well as the rest of the score) is brilliant. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin were obviously great choices as the recently deceased couple. Catherine O'Hara and Jefferey Jones fit quite well as the parents of the invading family, with their goth-daughter played by the heavenly Winona Ryder. And, last but not least, the character of Beetlejuice is portrayed perfectly by Michael Keaton.<br /><br />And for my personal opinion:<br /><br />Keaton stole the show, no doubt about it. I think the main reason anyone should see this is for the whacky charismatic character of Beetlejuice. From some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear, to the nutty antics he applies to practically everything he does, he's one of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen. Superbly supported by an extensive cast and crew that knew what they were doing and everything that was needed for a classic comedy of twisted themes, there is no denying the power of such a film. This is a must-see for sure (and for most, a must-own).

review/summary: One of Tim Burton's earliest and best films
review/text: Edited this review on 10/28/08.<br /><br />Ever since I saw Beetlejuice as a kid I have found more and more to like about it with each viewing. Throw in some bizarre concepts and characters, add humor and cool old school special effects, top it all off with an outstanding wacky performance by Michael Keaton and you might begin to understand why it works. This movie is just so much fun to watch mainly because it combines so many genres and to this day it remains one of the most unique takes on a ghost story.<br /><br />I have the old 1997 (were DVDs around then?) DVD release and the picture and sound isn't that great. This Blu-ray is like a whole new experience in terms of video and audio quality. It's worth the upgrade if you like Beetlejuice as much as I do.
