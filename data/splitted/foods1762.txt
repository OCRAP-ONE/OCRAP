review/summary: Not for Dark Blend Coffee Drinkers
review/text: I am a fan of other Timothy K Cups, but not this one. I tried it based on the reviews, but unfortunately it is not that strong. Of course it's a matter of taste. I prefer the darker blends, but if you are someone who prefers a "not so strong" coffee than I guess you would enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, it does not taste bad, just too weak for my preference.

review/summary: Excellent medium roast
review/text: Realizing that these reviews are very subjective and it is hard to judge taste... these are my favorite K-cups so far and I have tried many. They are not too dark and not too weak, but with a great sweet and nutty flavor and are very consistent. If typical breakfast blends and the like are just too weak for you and the super-double dark ones are too bitter, give these a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />For a "taste preference" reference point, I am also a big fan of Kona and Kona blends.

review/text: The best tasting hot tea on the market! 1/3 the caffeine of coffee (which I gave up in 1999). My local favorites like Kroger and Walmart don't consistently carry this product. And the really good news is that by ordering from Amazon, usually with no mailing costs, per box the tea is at least a few cents less than at the local stores. Now go figure that! Thank you Lipton and Amazon.

Still, iced it might be nice for a party or something! Did notice hints of artifical notes of flavor.  *A great one to try is, Harney&Sons fine teas bit more expensive (Amazon sells) Vanilla flavor; soft/smooth/yum hot w/ touch milk and honey, look forward to trying it iced!  Another good tea is Stash brand (priced great), Vanilla nut Creme.  Hot, its smooth, tasting a nice vanilla and a creamy smoothness, I don't taste nut just vanilla and creamy notes.

review/summary: One of the weakest tasting olive oils I've ever had
review/text: After reading one product review about this being the best product, I was immediatley intrigued.  I love a good quality extra virgin olive oil and am always searching for good bottles of imported oil.  I want to have the flavor come through especially in a salad or on warm bread.  If that is what you want, this product will disappoint.  Not all oils are strong, but I found my bottle to have no flavor what-so-ever.  I could discern no flavor that said this is extra virgin olive oil.<br />I have had great olives oils and a friend even brought back some from Greece which was rich, thick, and green.  It was amazing.  This did not even come close.<br />I now see four other reviewers who have rated this as the best.  I don't know how that could be.  I am wondering what happened with my oil???

We were thrilled to find here in USA an original product deriving from our country and my wife likes to use it every time she cooks, resulting in tasty and full flavored foods. I would strongly recommend this basic component of the Mediterranean diet to anyone who want to improve his nutritional habits.

review/text: We have used SAF Instant Yeast (the one with the Red Band at bottom of the package), in a restaurant for more than twenty years.  This Instant Gold works much faster than the one with the Red Band and less yeast is required. In recipes that called for 1 Tbs of yeast we now use 1 1/2 tsp.  Although the Instant Gold costs about 20% more than than the other; it uses half as much so in the end it costs less.  We also have more success with this yeast when making a gluten free bread.

review/text: As another reviewer stated already, this is not labeled 'low calorie' or 'low sugar' so I didn't expect it to contain artificial sweetener. I guess that's my fault for assuming, as this does contain sucralose and has a terrible, artificial sweetener aftertaste. I understand that this taste apparently doesn't bother a lot of people, but I absolutely can't stand it and will be returning this product. I feel that this should be disclosed on the package a bit more prominently than just listed on the ingredients (I bought at Meijer, not at Amazon, where I was able to look at the package before purchasing). I know, I know, I should've checked the ingredients. I wish I would've. I'm only writing this review as a warning to anyone else who may be considering the purchase, but like me, hates that fake sugar flavor (not to mention putting whatever chemicals they use for that stuff into their body).

I enjoy both my coffee & tea very sweet, but I actually don't need as much sugar for this chai tea.  I put in the same amount I normally do for tea, and it's extra sweet (but still great) so next time I know not to use as much sugar.<br /><br />I will definitely continue buying this one.

review/text: This is a decent Chai latte.. not the best I've ever had, but certainly the best I've found for the Keurig.  It seems a bit watered down and doesn't have the impact of the spice that I like in Chai.  Just aroma and spice-wise, I actually prefer the Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai k-cups with a bit of milk added after it's done (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XHI/ref=oh_o01_s01_i01_details).

review/text: I love Tazo Chai concentrate (just heat with milk) and this nothing close.  It has a very strong artificial taste.  It Smells good, but tastes strongly of powdered non-dairy creamer and way too much sweet and low (those pink packets of sweetener).  Too bad, because it is a great idea and I really wanted to like this.

review/summary: WAY too SWEET for me!
review/text: As someone who really enjoys a Chai Tea Latte from time to time, I was really excited when I saw this product and read some of the rave reviews! When I brewed the first one I was impressed right away by the presentation and aroma. However, when I took the first sip it was almost too sweet to drink. It tastes like liquid caramel with a hint of spice. Personally I prefer my Chai with more spice and not much sweet, so this was not what I was looking for. If you do like sweet drinks, though, everything else about this was 5 star. So, I guess it depends on preference. Wish I had ordered this in a sampler because I don't think I'll be able to finish them all.

review/summary: Not a bad chai latte but expensive
review/text: If I could I'd give it 3.5 stars.<br /><br />The flavor isn't terrible. Not as good as a real chai latte of course but it has decent chai flavor and is relatively creamy. I do wish it was a bit spicier though (could probably mix this with real chai tea). Not bad calorie wise compared to other brands of chai latte powders because it uses artificial sweetener over real sugar. I don't mind but I know some people aren't fans of artificial sweetener.<br /><br />The only major hit this gets is that the price is really expensive. Each cup costs quite a bit more than regular k-cups but of course k-cups were never really for price conscious individuals. Definitely would not buy a keurig just for these since there's readily available chai latte powders that are just as quick to make at a much cheaper price.

review/summary: Really Good Chai Latte
review/text: If you like Chai Latte tea and don't want to fuss with making it the 'old Fashion" way, this is a good alternative.  Of course, you have to own a K-Cup coffee machine.  I've bought a few of these boxes of 24 k-cups.  The last time I ordered them they came in a package of 2 boxes (48 total) for about $32.  Now it looks like amazon is selling them as 1 box (24 k-cups) for about $18.  To me the key to buying this (or almost any item) on amazon is to do a search first.  There are many different sellers here and they all seem to have different prices and a different number of k-cups in their boxes.  Some add shipping and some have free shipping.<br /><br />As far as the tea goes, I really like it and would highly recommend it!

review/text: These just taste awful! Not at all like an authentic chai tea. They are very chemical tasting almost like faux sweetener. I despise aspartame sweetener and this tastes exactly like that except I don't know what is actually in the k cups as I don't recall there being ingredients on the box? If you like fake sweeteners, you'll love these.

review/summary: Not Starbucks - But Very Good
review/text: The product is as good as any product for the Keurig K Cup Brewers.  I drink about 3 of these a day and the price is well below the super market price.  I will continue to buy this product for as long as it is offered.  It is not Starbucks but i dont like starbucks anyway

review/text: I am a fan of chi but this is only okay.  I made this using the 8oz setting.  I found it to be too sweet.  I added two little half&half cups which helped a bit, but it still had the chemical sweet taste.

review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: This is too sweet for my preference. I love chai, but to me it tastes like milk with sugar and few spices. If you prefer chai where you taste more of the tea and spices and less sweetness, I would not recommend this k-cup selection.

review/summary: Worst aftertaste ever.. even more then diet drinks
review/text: I love coffee. I love chai lattes. I love my Keurig. But this combination was disgusting. The taste when first prepared was STRONG. OK, I get that and could even even like it... if the aftertaste didn't kick in. I have never tasted so much artificial sweetener in any product. This is not listed as lo-cal or diet.. so it was not at all what I was expecting. I would rather have an aspirin dissolve in my mouth. I am returning this to the store. Absolutely terrible.

review/summary: Yuck! Don't fall for the high ratings!!!!
review/text: I did not like the taste of this at all.  It was awful.  I think the Tazo Chai Tea concentrate heated up with milk makes a much better chai latte.  I did want to try this one based on the high reviews and the fact that it would be easy in the keurig to make this drink.  It was NOT good.  I'm going to try my best to give these away.

review/summary: Disappointing Chai
review/text: Loved the thought of making a Chai Latte at home in our new Keurig machine.  Read the reviews and despite some that were negative, bought the Chai Escapes.  That was a mistake.  The chemical aftertaste is very pronounced and distasteful.  The bad taste can be muted a little with the addition of milk or half & Half, but do not recommend these for a Chai Latte Fix.

review/summary: Don't Just Add Water!! Add milk!!
review/text: I bought these chai latte cups because I love Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts versions, but BE WARNED just adding water seems to intensify the artifical taste. While this seems redundant ADD MILK! It say latte, but there is something off with the ingredients so I do half water and the other half vanilla soy milk! It tastes great!! I can't digest lactose so I haven't tried cow milk, but Soy Milk does wonders! Don't throw your kcups away just yet. Also, you don't even need a keurig for these cups, alll the powder dissolves in hot water so no straining of grinds is necessary, so I mastered the half hot water half soy milk combo by just opening the foil pouring it all in then filling the cup (probably about 12-16 oz cup) half with hot water then half with soy milk.

review/summary: The best cocoa EVER
review/text: This stuff is amazing. The grocery store had a sale on it for $3 something a box and the salted caramel was totally cleaned out. It's just that good. I'm pregnant and this is a major craving for me! I recommend using 2% or whole milk -- fat free just doesn't work as well in this. Measure your milk too and be sure it's a cup. Don't forget the Reddi Wip!

review/text: El Yucateco Green Habanero is my favorite hot sauce. It is not vinegary, so, while it does have a subtle flavor, it is an excellent choice if you only want to make foods spicy without noticeably changing their already pleasing flavor. For instance, this sauce is fabulous on a good grilled hamburger, barbecue and spaghetti. Let me warn you, though. I only put 3 to 4 drops of it on a burger. You go splashing it all over supper and you'd better have a plan B. The good news is that a bottle of it lasts a long time.

review/text: Had this hot sauce at a little Mexican restaurant about a month ago - I couldn't get enough!  I love all of the heat without the strong vinegar taste of Red Hot or even pickled jalapenos.  I searched around for the sauce in stores but could never find it - thanks to amazon, I can induldge in my cravings for this hot sauce.

review/summary: Hands-down the most flavorful hot sauce ever
review/text: I tried this first at an authentic Mexican restaurant we used to frequent. Just a few drops here and there on a dish would make the flavor really pop. Now we keep it on hand at home and use it on all kinds of things. I put it in chili, mix it into mayo for a zesty sandwich spread, use it liberally when I'm in the mood to have my eyeballs fall out, etc. Now that I've had this sauce, nothing else will do!

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: I first had this at a local Mexican restaurant and went crazy for it, even though I thought I might die of the heat.  I am a huge, yet disciminating, fan of hot suaces in general but this is by far my favorite right now.  I can handle a lot of heat as a regular hot sauce eater but this stuff is on a different scale than what you can get at the grocery store.  My husband won't come near this stuff.  It is so good I want to pour it on whatever I'm eating but it is sooooo hot I have to find that threshold of barely tolerable heat before it's so much I can't take it.  Of course, with continued dosage I can do more over time.  Our Publix and Kroger doesn't carry it so I have to go to the mercado/taqueria and can only get the 4 oz. version so this time I actually bought three 8 oz. bottles here on Amazon (fiendish, I know).<br /><br />The flavor is excellent, uncomplicated and straight forward like fresh green habaneros blended with a bit of salt and a bit of vinegar.  It isn't thin or overly vinegary or too salty though like a lot of hot sauces. I think this is because there is more actual habaneros in there because it's a little thicker consistency with a bit of fine texture to it.  Also, the color is fabulous.  I don't know if they add food dye or not but it is this vibrant, almost neon grass green.  Love it.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat it is on simple things like carne asada with flour tortillas, avocado and shredded lettuce, on 'over medium' fried eggs, and it's perfect on fish tacos with cool slaw, raw white onion and ranch.  The Mexican restaurant where I first had this doesn't have it on the tables anymore (probably because it's too hot for most) but they take it and puree it fine with avocado for this outrageously hot guacamole/habanero sauce thing that is just awesome.<br /><br />So obviously I love it and highly recommend it for experienced hot sauce people.

review/text: I love to spice up my food whether it is chili, soup, Mexican food,  or some type of meat or barbeque.  This El Yucateco Green Chile Habanero Sauce is wonderful if you like HOT SPICY SAUCE!  This is one of the great hot sauces that doesn't  taste like vinegar.<br /><br />This is a great sauce to use as an additive in other sauces or barbeque sauces to add zest to them.  You can control the dose to get the right flavor.  Sometimes a mixture of two or three sauces comes up with the right combination for a perfect barbeque basting sauce.<br /><br />I included a photo of the nutrition label for your information.  This is a great hot sauce and one of my favorites. If you like spicy food then you will love this one!  Easy does it or you will be saying ouch!

review/text: This is a staple in the fridge of any hot sauce lover.  El Yucateco is great in chili and with Mexican cuisine.  It does have some heat to it but the flavor of this sauce is really nice as well.  It is quite thick and when used at the rate of a tablespoon in a bowl of chili, you may notice a slight sweat forming on your brow.  That is what I am looking for when I eat spicy foods... I am not looking for chemical burns in my mouth but I do like to sweat a little.
