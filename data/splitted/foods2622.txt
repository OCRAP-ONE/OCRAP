review/summary: Just a spoonful of sugar...
review/text: I've been buying the C&H sugar packets for some time, but now that I've heard about the issues with GMO (genetically modified) sugar, I am switching entirely to organic sugar.  I want sugar that nature provides, not sugar that has been genetically modified in a laboratory.  Primarily, that is why I really like this sugar.  I also noticed my herbal tea seems to taste better with this sugar, possibly due to the larger crystals.  It is also a beautiful golden color that makes it look more natural.  The packet size is perfect for me to keep some in my desk at work, and the cost for 1000 packets is actually quite reasonable - compared to the cost per packet to regular sugar packets in the smaller grocery store quantities.

review/text: Sugar is sugar right?  BUT this is organic and another huge PLUS for me is that it's fair trade!  I think it very important that the people that harvest this for us get compensated fairly to do so and not live in poverty while the company makes all the money.  This is the way Im choosing my sugar ....

review/text: I am the only organic nerd at work so I have resorted to a hot pot and my own coffee and tea supplies.  These are great to keep in my cubicle and don't make a mess like a bag of sugar or sugar cubes would.  And since there are so many, it ends up being pretty affordable per serving.  My only heartburn is that since I am not ordering for a office of people, only myself, I wish that they hadn't just come loose in the box.  I was hoping they would arrive in like 100 packs or something.  No such luck.

review/summary: My First Love (For Soup, That Is)
review/text: I have loved Campbell's Green Pea Soup for a long time. It was sold on Wednesdays and Fridays at a restaurant in Rockford, Illinois all through winter. The first time I had this, I bought a cup.  It was so good that I bought a bowl, as well. Ever since then, I have enjoyed it whenever I can find it.  It is hard to find on store shelves, so when I have been able to find this, I always try to stock up, and keep a couple of cans on hand. Buying it by the case as Amazon sells it is the best buy around, as otherwise it is $2.19 - 2.99 a CAN!<br /><br />While the instructions on the can tell you to blend in a can of water, I use milk. I admit that this is hardly diet fare, but then, what do you want for a bowl of soup that will keep you warm all day in the winter? This is a hearty soup that sticks to your ribs and gives you that "all is well" feeling. Green peas that have been cooked to perfection, and then pureed to a silky smooth texture that keeps you going all afternoon, and invites you to dip big chunks of hearty, buttered bread.<br /><br />I have rated this as five stars. This is a higher rating than I give to MacDonald's French Fries!<br /><br />One caveat: One 12 ounce serving has 870 mg of sodium, so it is not something I would serve to someone with kidney problems. On the other hand, there are four grams of fiber, so it is not all bad.<br /><br />All in all, when I make it with milk and eat it with buttered bread, it is a sybaritic treat!

review/text: For some reason, Green Pea Soup tastes very different from Split Pea Soup, though I understand they are made basically the same -- with Green Pea simply whipped until it is smooth.<br /><br />It tastes, however, like something completely different - and wonderful!<br /><br />I cannot find this soup in any grocery stores, chain supermarkets, or anywhere else in the San Francisco Bay Area, so I was delighted to find it on Amazon. A friend-co-addict and I split a case, and ate it up in no time, so I ordered another case - and that lasted, using sheer willpower, a month.<br /><br />So I ordered another case - and put myself on the automatic-reorder -- for every six months, just to pace myself.<br /><br />And it's even healthy! Of course, after I slather butter on, it's probably a great deal less healthy. But I am content!

review/text: I thought is was suppose to be a concentrated liquid soup, but noooooo! The content is soooooo solid and dry, that I have to literally apply quite an effort with a spoon to dig it out of the can! Adding water, with constant stirring, and bringing it to boiling is NOT enough to dissolve the hard large size soup particles, let alone the small ones that remain stubbornly solid througout the 'cooking'. I have to use a hand-held automatic mixer (!) to dissolve and liquify that soup! Unheard of any other canned products I ever had, including other Campbell soups! Don't know what's wrong with the pea-soup, but have an impression that it was stored improperly in a high heat or something that has hardened the content to that extent!

review/summary: This is my absolute favorite 12 year old!
review/text: Balvenie is an old distillery that still does everything the only fashioned way.  Their copper stills are shaped differently than other distilleries and they turn all of their malt by hand (a rarity).  The Doublewood is made the traditional way of being aged in bourbon casks.  They age for 12 years and then they move them into casks that were used for sherry.  They age them there to the taste of the master distiller (averaging about 9 months), then bottle this nectar up.  This is the same method as Glenmorangie Lasanta, but with less smoke and peat and sweeter.<br /><br />Doublewood is a fruitier, lighter scotch with very little smoke in the flavor.  There is a strong hint of honey, followed by some caramel and spices (like cinnamon).  The best way to describe this to my friends, and they all agree, is that it tastes like Macallan 12, but with cinnamon added.  I love Macallan, but I love this more!  I also love that it comes in a slightly shorter bottle so it stores a little easier than the wine-size of Macallan.

I got these nut butters becuz i am vegetarian, and eating nuts themselves gives me awful pains.  The butters are perfect for me to eat, even if it is just by the small spoonfull!<br /><br />You can tell these are high quality butters.  I didnt give 5 stars becuz there are no directions about how to keep, or how long they last.  I have emailed the company to see if they need to go in the fridge.  I dont like my natural peanut butter that way - but i know sometimes you just have to, to make it last.<br /><br />I will order from this company again.

review/text: Faschi walnut butter is just walnuts, nothing else at all, pure walnutty taste and texture, it is fabulous! Especially good on slices of apple. There are no added oils which is a blessing; I ordered from another company and the butters were so full of peanut oil I had to give them to my neighbor, I mean, they were swimming in the stuff. But Faschi is superb. You will love it.

review/text: This is a very good walnut butter, it's all raw walnuts, nothing else added. Walnuts are high in W3, most people are very deficent of W3.<br />A great way to use this: low fat organic Cottage cheese, Walnut butter, cinnamon, a little bit of almond milk, add low calorie almond milk to desired consistency, Udo's choice flax oil. Udo's is a great blend of oils. Optional: Stevia. It will be like yogart in texture, taste great. Very nutrionally healthy, great low carb meal packed with nutrition. You'll be hooked on this!

review/summary: Fresh Walnut Butter
review/text: This is the first time I've tried Fastachi Walnut Butter and can't believe how fresh and tasty this was even though it's just plain walnuts.  It's not like a smooth spread like peanut butter but it's still spreadable and it's so delicious on top of salted crackers. Makes a good afternoon snack.

review/text: I love Fastachi because there aren't that many nut-butter companies out there that have so many different types in large sizes for responsible prices. Bye, bye, single served almond butter packs, hello walnut and pistachio butter! Personally I think, walnuts are better for you than almonds (since most people don't get enough omega-3s) and definately more so than peanut butter. Wished my grocery sold Fastachi because it is a treat ordering some, because of shipping. Tasty and pure stuff.

review/summary: I love that it's not too sweet
review/text: I drink mostly black teas. I will have the occasional herbal tea or white tea, but black tea blends are by far my favorite. So with that said, I am always on the lookout for a great new flavor. I have been enjoying Harney and Sons teas for years now, and when I learned about this SoHo Coconut and Chocolate black tea, I had to try it. I'm pleased to say it tastes wonderful. I was a little concerned at first that it might end up being too sweet, thankfully it is not. The coconut and chocolate are more like subtle hints, rather than a bold flavor. I find I can taste about the same amount of both the chocolate and coconut in the tea. The flavor is very similar to the Harney and Sons Valentines blend, so if you are familiar with that one, you have a idea of how this tea is flavored. The chocolate tea blends really help if you get a sweet tooth in the evening and would normally just snack on something. Instead make a hot cup of this tea and it will curb that chocolate craving. I love this blend. Highly recommended!

review/text: I love their teas. Their hot cinnamon spice is truly excellent and the chocolate mint is very good. The sachets are really nice also and are very hard to tear. I was a bit disappointed with this tea. I have a hard time tasting the coconut. The chocolate comes through, however. It depends on how much money is spent on the tin. If it is $15 for 20 satchels that is a bit pricey. Most of the other H & S teas are less than $10. I would have expected more of the coconut taste come through. One of the other reviewers thought it was strong. Well it might be for them, but I can barely taste it. I really like the taste combination in other things. I give it 3 stars as long as the price is above $15.

review/text: We live in a rural area, and I don't get to the grocery store too often, so these are very handy to keep in the pantry with some in the fridge so you can use it amytime.  They come with a straw, but I just use them mostly for cereal.  I don't really just drink the soy milk as a beverage, so I don't know how it compares to other soymilk that way.

review/summary: Quite Possibly the Very Best Soymilk in the World...
review/text: Eden Foods is quite possibly the world's greatest food company.  If you read their history of organic and natural foods you'll be amazed, pleased, and inspired by the efforts they take to make sure their products are the very best.  I can't say enough good things about this company.  The founder is one of the key leaders in the organic food world and take initiatives that no-one else would ever take to make sure that you (and I) are getting the very best food in the world. No exaggeration.  They were the first to go BPA-free, USA organic soybean, non-GMO certified, etc.  Eden Soy is the main Eden product and it is wonderful. Rich, smooth, and nutritious.  Once you open it... it spoils in 3-5 days.  Why? Because it's real food!  Even bacteria know what's good!  Love Eden Soy and absolutely love Eden Foods!

review/summary: Bad Marks For Supplier and Shelf Life, Love the Product
review/text: I received the shipment March 8 as expected but noticed a "Best By June 2012" stamped on the outer carton. I'd purchased these expecting at least a 6 month shelf life (the Edensoy I just got from WF expires Dec. 2012). Because I bought them to stock my pantry for the year, with plans to use them on trips and as back-ups when I don't have time to make my own soy milk, this short shelf life was unacceptable. I didn't realize they were not returnable. Amazon is giving me a partial credit. So I'll keep those that I can use before June and will donate the rest to a local food cupboard right away so they can be consumed on a timely basis. I was informed there's no way of knowing the exp. date at the time of such a purchase. I fault the supplier, not Amazon, for sending me short-life goods. I'll be more careful about buying grocery items in future. This is the soymilk I prefer over all others - rich, creamy, mild tasting, and not as sweet as most. Excellent response from Amazon via live chat.

review/text: The  chia powder arrived quickly. I had tried chia seeds from another company. They  had very little flavor. I mixed a tablespoon in a cup of water and ate it like soup.  Thinking the powder would be similar, I ordered a large amount.  The taste is not to my liking. I am stuck with 2.2 pounds. I have taken to mixing a tablespoon of powder with a teaspoon of lemon curd to try to diminish the unpleasant  flavor. Then I mix this with a serving spoon of plain yogurt.  Edible but not yummy.  I suppose this would work in some baked Items but I am not going to try it.  The chia seeds really curbed my appetite. The powder has not been as effective. I was told seeds can be detrimental to the intestinal track in some people.

review/summary: Finally found it!
review/text: A friend from Hong Kong gave me a give of this tea a few years ago and I never bothered to try it.  Then I spent a few weeks in Hong Kong and tried some tea there - yummy.  I have allergic reactions to some green teas, unfortunately, so I have to be cautious with teas.<br /><br />anyway, after returning home, I decided to try some of the gifted tea and LOVED IT!  Being cheap like I am, once that tea was gone - it was just a tiny tin - I picked up some other well known brands (Twinings for example) and tried them.  Eh - not bad, but not good either.  I figured I was out of luck and would need to go back to Hong Kong.<br /><br />Found this here, ordered it and I'm sipping my first cup now.  Nice, yummy, just what I needed.  The famous Ahmad tea blend is really nice and smooth.  I drink it straight, but understand milk enhances the flavor for some.<br /><br />The tea arrived in 3 tins each about 4 inches tall. I'm guessing that is part of the high cost. Inside each tin were separate tea pouches, without a string.  A single tin would be a nice gift.

(the real guarantee its made without pesticides, chemicals, or GMO's!)<br /><br />I also like that it has flax seed which has been used for its "healing properties" since the Babylonians. (3000 BC)<br /><br />If your interested in "food healing" this is a perfect start, because it tastes better than most "normal" foods that are filled with chemicals & Genetically Modified Organisms. The Blueberry chunks are apparent & taste yummy. ( I always have at least 8 Blueberries in each packet, hmm..)<br /><br />Also, its made locally (at least here in Washington STATE) :)<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this oatmeal!

review/summary: Excellent cereal at an excellent price
review/text: I buy this through the Amazon Subscribe and Save program and it's a great value and really handy to always have a few boxes on hand.  My girlfriend and I each take this to work and also keep some on hand at home for a quick, healthy breakfast.  The flavor is great, sometimes I will mix in a bit of plain oats with it to make it a little heartier but the spices and blueberries are delicious and I save so much buying it here.  Great product.

review/summary: Good but don't expect a lot of blueberry flavor...
review/text: As other reviews have mentioned, the first morning I had the oatmeal for breakfast I made 3 packs and in total, I don't think there were even 10 blueberries. It's definitely cinnamon flavored first with a very faint taste of blueberry....but that said, I still thought it tasted good and while I'm no health food expert, looking at the ingredients it does appear to be pretty good for choice for a quick-on-the-go breakfast. I would buy again I'll probably look at what other flavors Nature's Path offers when I'm finished with this box.<br /><br />Amazon shopping experience top notch as usual...

review/summary: Natures Path I love...this one not so much
review/text: This is a purely subjective review.  I love the Natures Path products and have been buying their oatmeal for years.  However, I would have to say this particular flavor is unimpressive.  It does not have the nice thick consistency of some of the other flavors, there are very few blueberries in it, and the cinnamon is weak.  I'd recommend the Flax Seed or Apples and Cinnamon flavors.

review/text: The Happy Hips line are well worth the cost, expecially for senior pets. My dog has arthritis and refuses to take her glucosomine pills and this helps her in that regard. She eats all of it without issue, and likes the chicken flavor too! It is important to buy your pet food with healthy ingredients and therefore you cannot go wrong with Happy Hips. She even knows it by name! I use the subsribe and save option and that sure beats running out to the store every week or so!

review/summary: Enjoyable!
review/text: I bought the Red Goji Raspberry, Purple Acai Blueberry and White Mangosteen Peach teas to try out when they first came to the market. Out of the three, I enjoy Purple Acai Blueberry the best, but Red Goji Raspberry is also quite enjoyable. For me, the main difference is in perceived sweetness, I don't like fruity "teas" and this raspberry flavor seems to come out sweeter than blueberry (I don't add sugar to my teas). Other than that, it's a great tea and might be preferred by many. Again, one can smell green tea with a fruity background, it has a good color and a pleasant taste, and has no artificial put-off what-so-ever (which for me is very important). However, this tea surely is NOT for people who enjoy strong artificially flavored teas, particularly all the colorful berry mixes out there.

review/summary: Not much flavor at all
review/text: I have to focus on the aspects that I can detect (taste and smell) and not ones on which I could only speculate (potency of antioxidants).<br /><br />This tea has very little flavor.  It smells as if it will have a rich, fruity flavor but that is not at all the case.  There is no raspberry in it.  The name of the tea is "Green Tea Superfruit (Red Goji and Respberry)".  It contains (green tea, natural flavor, soy lecithin, blueberry juice solids, concentrated goji juice solids)<br /><br />No raspberry at all... So I guess the "natural flavor" is raspberry flavor?  Why not just include raspberry juice solids or concentrated raspberry juice solids?<br /><br />Anyway, the net here is that it is green tea with a questionable attempt at being true to its name of "Red Goji and Raspberry"... It does not taste bad, it simply doesn't taste like much at all.  I will continue to drink it (and the other 5 boxes I bought in my six-pack), as there is nothing in the ingredients list that I specifically disapprove of and I will trust the antioxidant counts they provide, that come from the green tea itself.  I might turn it into iced tea in the summer and add lemonade to it so it will have some flavor.<br /><br />I would not buy this again but would try another variety of Lipton (or other) Green Tea.  Other Lipton teas (like the Pyramid Bedtime Story) have been excellent.

review/summary: Very weak green tea and it is not even white tea
review/text: I ordered the tea out of curiosity and just tried it yesterday. To my surprise, the tea is very week. I had to use two tea bags in order to make the regular strength of any green tea I have. I thought I might bought the white tea since the purchase was made a while ago. But after looking att he package, it is not. Maybe the "precious" Goji berry is too expensive that they have to skim on the tea leaves they put in. I do not recommend this product if you want the regular strength with alternative flavor. It is just too weak.

review/summary: Daily Relaxation-Green Tea Benefits
review/text: If you enjoy delicate flavors in tea, this is one of the best tasting tea products- raspberry flavor really comes through.  (This tea is not for those who enjoy long-brewed, strong-flavored tea). This is my favorite early evening relaxation tea.  Brew, enjoy and I even add milk while getting green tea benefits. This product is more expensive and difficult to find in retail stores. Amazon's price and delivery to home are very convenient.

review/text: I drink both tea a coffee every day but the balance is shifting to tea thanks to Lipton Superfruit green tea. Hard to believe that anything that tastes so good is really good for you - green tea and Goji. Only question is the ingredient list says nothing about rasbperry (reason Lipton spells it that way?) even though they show a picture of a raspberry on the box, looks like the flavor comes from blueberry which is really good for you too. And oh yes don't look for the tea to be red it is more of a pale green. Enjoying a cup now.

review/summary: Very little Tea in this product! Yields a weak, watered down lower than expected tea experience.
review/text: I ordered this product when it was on sale a while back, and got the 6 pack of boxes. After brewing a few tea bags, I thought the Red Goji/Raspberry flavor was indeed there, but the low amount of tea in each tea bag, didn't deliver almost any kind of caffeine lift. Each tea bag has very little tea in it. I called Lipton to complain, and the nice lady on the other end, pointed out that each tea bag has 1.2 grams of tea in it. (My box actually says 1.3g)  Hmm, I thought, how much tea by weight does an average tea bag of green tea have? My unflavored Meijer green tea bags have 2.2 grams of tea! The other two flavors of Lipton tea I bought also have a lot more tea in them when compared to the Red Goji/ Raspberry Lipton Tea. The Lipton Lemon Ginseng tea has 1.7 grams of tea, and the Orange passion fruit & Jasmine has 2.0 grams of tea! Why on earth has Lipton shortchanged the amount of tea in the Red Goji Tea? Just add some more green tea Please Lipton! This product is a disappointment!

review/text: For due diligence, I opened my Red Goji and Raspberry to see if it was any different than my lackluster results with the Acai Blueberry.  It was exactly the same - there wasn't even a gradient of color other than a standard green tea.  I can tell no discernible difference between this and a normal green tea other than a very faint fragrance.  Definitely doesn't live up to expectations.

review/text: This is a great tasting tea.  It smells fantastic, and it really does taste sweet without even adding sweeteners.  I love it.  I wouldn't pay any extra money over their regular tea though.  I seriously doubt the goji is adding very much.  I have a feeling they are just trying to capitalize on the goji craze.  Even if goji helps you, the amount in this tea isn't very much in the long run.<br /><br />While I enjoy the goji tea, I much prefer the acai one they make.  But then, I love blueberries, so there you go.

review/text: How do you make $400 Million dollars a year with 1 product? Sell imported irradiated, pasteurized "fruit juice(?)" as a nutritional supplement.<br /><br />Where are the ingredients on this product? Shouldn't they be listed on this page?<br /><br />My chiropractor pressured me into buying a $40. bottle of "Xango." I got out my magnifying glass so I can tell you the  ingredients: citric acid, natural flavor, pectin, xanthum gum, sodium bensoate. Citric acid, yum, natural flavor,yum, pectin to thicken it up, and irratiated xanthum gum, and sodiom benzoate, an ingredient in fireworks which is used as a preservative, which combined with ascorbic acid (vit c such is found in fruit) forms benzene a known carcinogen. The additive sodiom benzoate is also thought to contribute to hyperactivity in children.<br /><br />Like I said, I bought a bottle of this to please my chiropractor, drank it at the medium dosage, and as I was finishing the bottle, fell sicker than I have been in years, with summer cold and flu symptoms.<br /><br />Well there's a sucker born every minute. I'd pay $40. for a bottle of something to cure my gullibility.
