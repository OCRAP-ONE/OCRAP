review/summary: Coffee for people that don't like coffee  (Edited)
review/text: I tried this coffee months ago and should have reviewed it sooner, but I've had a difficult time deciding how best to describe it. The title of my review probably sums it up best. This is coffee that is utterly inoffensive in every way. It's the opposite of bold. The roast is light. The flavor is extremely mellow, so mellow in fact that when this coffee is used as the base for a milk-based coffee drink like a latte, the flavor recedes into the background so much that it almost seems to disappear. Don't misunderstand, it's still readily identifiable as coffee, but...well...I'm still struggling with how to describe it.<br /><br />Think of it this way. This coffee can be brewed full strength with a very nice body and mouth feel to the resulting cup, and yet still have the kind of flavor profile that people who drink their coffee very weak (as in "Hey, shouldn't you put some coffee in your coffee?") might prefer. I don't mean that there is no coffee flavor, just that the coffee flavor is not bold, not robust and not the least bit assertive. Very mild. Almost meek. It's good coffee, but it's perplexing coffee.<br /><br />If you want a coffee that you can serve to people who don't like dark coffees, bold coffees or coffees that are just bursting with robust coffee flavor while preserving the ability to brew full strength for body and mouth feel (which in this coffee is downright silky), this is the stuff. The flavor is so submissive that it won't overwhelm anything.<br /><br />Most coffees I've ordered from Amazon have been good enough that I have ordered them again. I have yet to reorder this coffee, but at some point I am sure that I will, probably when I know I'll be needing to serve coffee for people who don't really like coffee. If that's the kind of stuff you're looking for, then I can recommend this without reservation.<br /><br />On edit (May 3, 2011)...<br /><br />I wish I could make this four and a half stars rather than just four. The last bag I ordered really grew on me as I learned more about the coffee's flavor profile and how to best make use of it.  I now use this coffee as a base for blending with other darker roasts and find that it provides a really creamy mouth feel and balance. When I want darker, I add more dark roasted beans. And when I have company I use a higher proportion of the Panama Boquete and sometimes nothing else at all.<br /><br />If you're a person that makes homemade ice cream and you're looking for a coffee to use as a flavoring base, this is the stuff. (I pull shots of espresso and add that to the ice cream mix. My lady friend stops by to help churn and it all gets devoured post-haste.)<br /><br />If you like red-eye gravy but don't want any bitterness, this is great coffee to use. (For those that don't know, red-eye gravy is made by pan frying slices of country ham and then adding a cup or so of coffee to the pan drippings. Serve with biscuits or grits or even sop it up with toast. Yum!)<br /><br />As I said in other reviews of coffees I have ordered, the highest compliment I can pay is to re-order. I re-ordered this coffee today. So there you go...

review/summary: Smooth coffee for a good price
review/text: Having tried and purchased high elevation coffee from the heart of Panama itself while traveling abroad, I've been looking for a home alternative to relive this taste (only brought back enough for a few weeks when I was down there!). I found this coffee to be smooth and tasteful when prepared properly. As drip coffee I have enjoyed it more than most beans I have tried up to this point, but still is not on par with the high elevation coffee I purchased in Panama for almost half this cost (however, 10x this cost if bought in the states).<br /><br />If you are use to a dark roast, this bean won't satisfy your coffee desires. If you enjoy a true arabica experience, you may want to look elsewhere, but it could be worth a try. If you enjoy a more "blended" taste than local arabica, with a medium full bodied roast, I highly recommend this coffee. I have come from all the styles of Lavazza and Illy, have purchased many variations from Dick's Coffee, and Coffee AM, and have ordered many varieties from local roasters. For this to get 4 stars is worth checking out. But again, know the style of beans you're going into. This is not a pure arabica, this is a medium roast with full body. I use this for Drip Coffee / French Press Coffee / Espresso / Cappuccinos. Give it a shot, if you like it you'll love it, if you don't like it, you may just hate it! But if you enjoy Illy medium roast, I will say this is VERY comparable minus that unique arabica taste (and $31 per lb price point!).

review/summary: Bargain Beans
review/text: I have paid over $50.00 per pound for Panama Boquete. In fact, La Esmeralda beans from this region can go for $200! I'd prefer a slightly darker roast, but this is a nice medium-light roast. Never bitter, even when I brew double strength for iced coffee. This is a great all-purpose coffee.

review/summary: Far Too Acidic to Be Marketed
review/text: I've tried several variations of this company's coffee and, every time, the product was far too acidic to have ever been considered acceptable for marketing.  There is no flavor really other than the acidity.  We did not finish any of them - we threw them away.<br /><br />I would like to add here that, when it comes to "gourmet" or "specialty" coffee, I hope that the companies attempting to profit in this sector wake up and realize that the customer base interested in purchasing such coffees actually knows coffee, and we aren't being fooled by this kind of sad attempt to sell us garbage.  Please, if you want to market good coffee, then find some, rather than just relying on terms like "organic" and "fair trade" and "grown someplace Third World but hip" or whatever.

review/text: I wanted to like this coffee as I appreciate the fair trade and organic policies of the company. However, I had my doubts from the moment I broke the seal on the can and there was no coffee smell whatsoever! There is hardly even an aroma when it brews! Drinking this, the coffee tastes stale and bitter with not even a remote hint of what a good cup of coffee should taste like.<br /><br />Perhaps their whole bean might have been better, I don't know. I got this for those mornings when you wake up and just don't want to take out the grinder and go through that process. Okay, I learned my lesson - it was a mistake!

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I am surprised at seeing so many mixed reviews for this coffee. I buy it weekly at my local grocery store and absolutely love it. It is by far my favorite. I don't know how other people could say it's too acidic since one of the reasons I enjoy this coffee so much is because it is so mild and easy on my stomach. I've never bought it through Amazon before but I don't see how the quality of the coffee would be any different than what I've experienced buying it in the store. Unfortunately, the 3 pack deal on Amazon isn't any better than what I would pay locally for three individual cans of this coffee so I won't be bothering to order it here.

review/text: If you are looking to make an Alfredo dish, whether it be chicken, shrimp, or both; this is the sauce that will make your stomach crave for more. This sauce is perfect in taste, when prepared right. I've been making my Alfredo with this Four Cheese Knorr Sauce for about 5 yrs now. And my family and I absolutely love it. The key to making it to perfection is to whisk the milk and the Knorr sauce mix together really good. I actually use Almond milk instead of regular milk to give it a sweeter taste. But anyway, you will love it. Give it a try, you will not regret it.

review/summary: Strange...
review/text: Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say "man I can sure go for some raman", but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars.

review/summary: Great taste and the probiotic part turns out to be true
review/text: I first tried this tea at a friend's; she had a collection of herbal teas and this one sounded interesting (I didn't even notice that it had probiotics). The tea had a wonderful scent of lemon and ginger that I really, really enjoyed. And it was delicious!<br /><br />The same friend dropped by a couple of weeks ago with a box of this tea and I've been drinking it every night ever since. Now I'm down to the last two bags so I came here to see if Amazon carried it and I'm delighted to see that they have it on Subscribe and Save for less than the sale price at my local supermarket.<br /><br />Now, about the probiotics. I really thought it was just a marketing scheme, but no, it isn't. I did some research and learned that the probiotic Bigelow uses is "GanedenBC30" and, if you do a search on that (go to the Gardenlabs site, the company that patented this particular probiotic strain), you'll learn that this probiotic survives high heat, stomach acid and enzymes, the manufacturing process, and is shelf stable. Look it up, there are many sites with  good info on this.<br /><br />Here's an excerpt from GanedenLabs: "Ganeden's probiotic strains are pure, precise, patented strains of Bacillus coagulans that provide superior viability compared to other probiotic bacteria. Ganeden's premier strain, GanedenBC30 is patented, has been proven effective in dozens of human, animal and laboratory tests, is self-affirmed GRAS, Kosher and a non-GMO. Plus, with hundreds of millions of doses consumed, GanedenBC30 has a proven track record of safety."<br /><br />Then I went to the Bigelow site and watched the video they have about their herbal teas, where they talk about how they developed this product.<br /><br />Now, does it work? Well, I've only been taking it daily for a couple of weeks (and only once a day -they recommend two cups per day) and, though I can't say it has had a noticeable effect on my digestion, I do find it soothing and I agree with one of the reviewers here in that this tea promotes a more restful sleep.

review/summary: Tomato-oregano Croccantini
review/text: This is my least favorite of the croccantini's; in fact, i dislike it period.  The taste is difficult to describe, but for a cracker I have found it compliments nothing.  I would never recommend this particular variety, but the other flavors are great.  I am too embarrassed to give as a gift with wine and cheese so I suppose I'll throw away.

review/summary: Scriptures are incredible! Makes a SUPER tasty gift
review/text: Thank you Shepherds Garden for a great product! The scriptures are well chosen, thoughtful. It really makes a perfect gift and accompaniment to quiet time (or any time!) As for flavor, compared to celestial seasoning's (non-organic) country peach passion, Shepherds is has soft peach tones and a more earthy flavor. Unless you're not a peach person or avid tea lover you should love it. It's organic too, which is VERY important for tea, and being a white tea it also contains less fluoride if that's a consideration for you. I got 5 boxes directly from their site for my mom, grandmom, sister, and friends this Christmas (great to pair w/ homemade breads or coffeecake!). If you don't think you'll dig peach they have a chai that's truly superior to any chai I've tasted, cranberry is good & unique, and peppermint just rocks (free samples at their website too...). No, they're not flavored with crazy artificial chemicals, sweeteners, non-organic leaves, and colorants. But I LIKE THAT! And for goodness sake they're Bible verse teas! How cool is that?!

review/summary: My Cats Loved It
review/text: I've been feeding my cats Tiki Cat's fish-based cat foods for a while, so when I saw that Tiki Cat also has chicken cat food I just had to try it out, and I am very glad I did. Although my cats would be happy to eat nothing but fish for every meal I try to feed them a balanced diet with protein from chicken, lamb and beef as well. This is a very nice chicken cat food: each of these tiny cans is jam packed with chicken shreds that look tastier than most canned chicken intended for people to eat (though as I am a vegetarian I haven't tried eating this food myself :-)<br /><br />This chicken is certified delicious by my two fussy felines, who ate up everything I gave them and then begged for more. And as an animal loving pet owner I am very glad that the label of each can makes it clear that no dolphins were harmed when they rounded up all the chickens. I only hope they managed to keep the whales out of the chicken farm as well.

review/summary: CARDAMON
review/text: My wife is a gourmet cook. She often needs spices and oils not easily found here in San Diego. Most retail outlets, even specialty shops cater mainly to southwestern and/or Latin American cooking. (we live only a few minutes from the Mexican border) She wanted to make something that had this spice as an ingredient. In the city of San Diego, this spice was hard to find. When we did find it was prohibitively expensive and it was only one ounce.<br /><br />We ended up purchasing that small amount and having that dinner party. However, we looked online and as always Amazon came through. We found cardamon of superior quality and in generous amounts for a price that was more than reasonable.  We got nearly 4 ouunces for less than the price we paid one 1 ounce.

review/text: I purchased 2 bags from a compeditor for less than half the current listed price & it's well worth the extra money spent (over regular beans). The price has gone up a few bucks since I purchased back in October but it's still a bargain. The aroma you smell when filling your grinder becomes a great tasting brew that won't keep you up at night! It's also strong enough to drink in the AM if you happen to run out of your favorite regular beans!  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Cheesecake may spoil during delivery
review/text: I got a 6 month cheesecake order as a gift, and the first cheeesecake arrived packed in dry ice.  It was frozen and tasted great after a night in the fridge.<br /><br />The second cheesecake arrived spoiled.  They did not ensure rapid delivery of the cake and the dry ice melted while the cake was in transit.  When I called the company and asked for a replacement, they said that would be impossible, and that I would have to pick another product.  I asked to speak to a manager and the manager acted like it was my fault that the cake spoiled in transit, and said I was lucky that they were willing to give me anything.<br /><br />I've ordered other month clubs from other companies in the past, and never once had an item spoil prior to delivery.  And on the very rare occasion a product arrived damaged, other companies were very willing to make it up to me.  Amazing clubs made it very clear they had no interest in customer satisfaction.

review/summary: Cleanest pintos you'll find
review/text: I love these pinto beans. Prior to soaking them I always put them in a strainer but unlike most pinto beans bought in bulk, there's never any foreign objects that need to be discarded. I appreciate the package size. To prepare. I cover them with water (about 3 inches over the top) in a pot, cover it and let it soak overnight. In the morning, discard the water (it can be used for watering your plants) and, if making a whole box, add 6 cups (3 cups of liquid for every 8 ounces of beans) of water, or broth, bring to a boil, then simmer covered for 90 minutes.<br /><br />They are delicious and highly nutritious (you probably already knew that). Of course, that they are organic, also makes them even more appealing, in my mind.<br /><br />I've purchased this product twice (total of 12 boxes). I've used ten of the twelve boxes and the quality is consistent.<br /><br />Buy and enjoy with confidence.

The quality of the beans is great, in my opinion...and of course I love that they are organic...but as another reviewer said - I thought the beans were out of date. I THOUGHT they were out of date, but after contacting the company though edenfoods.com I found out that the dates are just confusing on the packaging. When I saw "Best Before: 12DE07" I figured they expired December 12, 2007. The customer service representative that contacted me said the first two digits represent the year...meaning my beans are good until December 07, 2012. Good to know!<br /><br />And the contact on edenfoods.com was responded to quickly...I had an answer within half of a day.<br /><br />I'll be buying these again!

review/text: These are Eden brand dried black beans.  They are very good quality.  I have used this brand of dried beans quite a lot over the years.  They are very clean for dried beans. If you buy dried beans in bulk from a natural foods grocery, you will find more dirt clods and rocks than are in these.  How many clods are in the dried product is not a problem for me, but one of the other reviewers appeared to be horrified that they were in the beans.  Please, this has always been true of dried beans, some have more than others.  These have VERY LITTLE. But you should ALWAYS pick over dried beans and then wash them in two changes of water.

review/text: Not the right dimension to make a decent egg roll.<br /><br />What you need is an 8" wrap, or 22cm. They aren't easy to find but most local Chinese<br />markets have them. This size wrap makes what you would call a snack roll, you really<br />cant fill them properly.<br /><br />Dynasty is a good company and I've used their Hot Mustard for years. These wraps do work<br />and they hold together pretty well with nothing but a little egg wash. If you've never<br />ventured to make your own egg rolls its time you try, its very easy. And with Chinese<br />restaurants cutting back on portions i.e. $1.50 for a Air Roll, making your own will be<br />much more rewarding.

review/summary: Lite versus regular
review/text: The regular coconut milk - I've had a bunch of cans of it and they're all the same - is roughly a third to half coconut fat or butter that is solid at room temperature but easily melted at low heat in microwave or pan. The rest of the can is a somewhat viscous milky fluid. This "lite" version has none of the solid fat. It is all the milky fluid. Presumably it has FAR less fat.<br /><br />Ingredients listed are "water, coconut milk, guar gum". I'd rather there were no guar gum but please note the manufacturer has refrained from adding sodium metabisulfite. Some other brands of coconut products add that in order to keep the product white. But Google it. Sources claim that sodium metabisulfite is actually poisonous. I'm not a chemist but prefer my coconut milk unadulterated and thank this company for giving us a relatively pure product.<br /><br />I recently made a dish, I think it is a pudding kind of thing, using this lite version. I cooked a cup of well-washed millet in 3 cups of lightly salted water for 40 minutes, removed from heat and immediately folded in a half cup of confectioners sugar, a third of a cup of almond meal, a whole can of this lite coconut milk and a half teaspoon of cinnamon. Stirred it well. It tastes good (to me) warm or cold and I can really taste the coconut flavor. I like a dish of it topped with dried sweetened cranberries and a dollop of whipped cream (sinful and so easy from the spray can).

So It's Such A JOY, When A Flavored Snack Nails It Right On The Head; And That's EXACTLY What Herr's Has Done, With Their Baby Back Ribs Flavored Potato Chips!!Herr's Baby Back Ribs Potato Chips 8 oz (Pack of 3)<br /><br />From The Very 1st Bite, They REALLY Taste Like Baby Back Ribs, Starting Out Sweet, Then Coming "Back At Ya" With A Spicy Kick.<br /><br />I Actually Grabbed A Bag Of These At My Local Military Commissary As A Lesser Evil Choice, When I Couldn't Find My Usual BBQ Chips In Stock.<br /><br />Well, I Just Finished That 1st Bag Tonight; But I Assure You, It WON'T Be My LAST!!

review/summary: Positively Addicting!
review/text: Just when I became hopelessly addicted to Herr's Heinz Ketchup-flavored potato chips, along comes this new flavor meant to emulate the the sweet, yet subtle smoky flavor of barbecued ribs. There's honestly no way to put into words how good these chips are. They're just the most delicious-tasting BBQ-style chips I have ever tasted, with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TV9O9K">Lay's Potato Chips, KC Masterpiece BarBQ, 1 oz, 50-Count (Pack of 2)</a> coming in at a close second.<br /><br />What's particularly great about these chips is that unlike so many other popular  brands (*cough cough* Wise *cough cough* Pringles), Herr's doesn't short change its customers with a light dusting of seasoning. Its chips are always doused in powder, ensuring that you get a shot of flavor with each and every bite and plenty of it to lick off your fingers when you're done. So I can't recommend these highly enough-- unless, of course, you're on a diet, because you'll totally blow it if you even so much as take one nibble.

I can taste a meaty type flavoring to these that really makes them Baby Back Rib flavor and not just a BBQ flavor.  I wish I could find these in more stores and in a bigger bag.

review/summary: The most flavorful easiest pasta to make
review/text: This is the best pasta mix ever.  I make it according to the package instructions and then add parmesan cheese to the final dish.  Delicious!  My daughter insists I make extra so she can have the leftovers for breakfast.  If it doesn't have enough olives for your taste - just add extra when preparing it.  I've gotten the best results when I make it with regular spaghetti pasta.  There's also a Green Olive Pesto available - I can't tell the difference between the two - green olive or black olive - both are terrific!

review/summary: Where Are The Olives?
review/text: Although this product was tasty, I had hoped the olives would have been visible. Found only a few olive crumbs in the mix. I needed to use two packets for 8 ounces of pasta as per instructions. Would not recommed for a large crowd. Don't get me wrong, we did like the product. I was fooled by the packaging as it shows round sliced black olives. I will add my own olives to the mix with the remaining packages.

review/text: Wonderful product. I used to get it in the grocery stores, but now they don't sell it anymore. I was overjoyed to find it online.  This is better than any pesto sauce because you feel like you're making it yourself, and it's extraordinarily easy to make. You can make it with just a tad of water, and it goes with anything on which you like a pesto flavor. I used it as a base sauce when making my own flatbreads and pizzas. It goes great over a simple pasta. The recipe on the back works perfectly.  It isn't too salty. I'll bet there are many more possible uses for it (like roasting nuts or something like that). I highly recommend this item.

review/text: I am a lover of fine goat cheeses.  While I like my cheeses strong and pungent, I like my crostini plain and boring.  I am spending the big bucks on the cheese, and I don't want the cracker to interfere with the taste.  I have sampled many crostini and I think Isola Olive Oil are the best.  They are plain and unflavored, except for a bit of olive oil, and they compliment my cheese perfectly.<br /><br />I recommend these highly.

review/summary: Lots of variety in flavors, but not in drink types
review/text: Ordered direct from Amazon and got exactly what was promised - 35 different cups to try out and sample. My only complaint is that the product description lists several manufacturers and drink types (coffee, tea, iced tea, cocoa, cider, etc) yet the pack I got was heavily loaded with Green Mountain Coffee, more than half of the cups. Yes, different flavors or strengths, but same type of drink and same brand. Just wish it would of been a bit more even with the coffees/teas and not so loaded with Green Mountain (GM). 27 coffees (15 of which were from GM), and 8 "other" types of drinks.<br /><br />Good assortment to bring into work as there will be something for everyone to like, but like I said, just wish it was a little more even in the breakdown - or that Amazon offered a sampler of either "only coffee" or "no coffee and only teas, ciders, cocoas".<br /><br />Complete breakdown of what I got:<br />5 decaf (1 Newmans Own, 4 GM) - perfect for my pregnant coworker<br />1 half caff (GM)<br />1 iced tea (Celestral Seasonings)<br />1 regular tea (CS)<br />2 apple cider (Grove Square)<br />3 cappuccino (GS)<br />1 hot cocoa (GS)<br />4 extra dark/bold (GM)<br />4 flavored Gloria Jeans (hazelnut, butter toffee, mudslide, french vanilla supreme)<br />2 GM flavored coffees (southern pecan, caramel vanilla cream)<br />1 Kahlua<br />1 Donut Shop coffee<br />and 9 various other 'regular' types of coffees from GM and other brands.

review/text: While the concept of an asortment is wonderful, we were not too happy with ours. It's a gamble to order this assortment. Many reviewers had similar complaints. I think a company should come up with a way for us to choose our own assortmant. It's awful to pay for something that you will most likely not use or worse yet, throw away! So while not a huge investment here, I'm not certain we will order this again.<br /><br />Our order came from Kitchenista. The assortment did arrive loose in a box, none damaged. Here's what we recieved:<br /><br />0 hot chocolate ( we were looking forward to these!)<br />5 teas<br />13 flavored coffees<br />5 decaf coffees<br />2 espresso<br />7 dark coffees<br />3 ligt coffees<br /><br />So for those who love just about anything, this may work for you. For those of us who look for specific flavors, this may not be such a great deal.

I liked some of them a lot and wished there were duplicates, but there weren't (as advertised). They didn't come in a box which I thought was weird. They were in a plastic bag. No worries cause we just put them in a large bowl. I like the variety. But it would be nice if they had a variety pack with like 3-4 of the same kind.

I did get a good variety, and only had a few decaf (which is a good thing). However, there are four or five of them that when shaken, sound like most of the coffee grounds have leaked out or something. Not sure what is going on with those, but I'll try them and see what happens.<br />Overall it was a decent deal.

They are like a rock of hard substance like a bouillon cube in K-cup packaging. Gross. Cheap. And my mix contains quite a few of them. I ordered coffee K-cups from two vendors and to compare, they came in the same package from Amazon but the ones I am reviewing were in a plain brown bag closed at the top while the other was in a nice sealed box inside a box for freshmess. If the Grove Square product was omitted from this mix I would rate it higher but not by much.

review/summary: Good but not 35 as stated
review/text: I ordered this sampler, it states 35 K cups, got 33.  The assortment is OK, a lot of plain off and decafe coffee K-cups.  Would have lke to see more flavors in the mix and would have like to have received all 35 cups as listed.

review/summary: Only 3 true flavored coffees
review/text: I also bought this giving the company the benefit of the doubt, but was disappointed.  While I had a decent variety of hot cocoa, cappucino, tea, and even cider, there were only 3 true flavored coffees.  And I received about 15 bold/intense blend coffees with no flavor, just different makers.  To me, that isn't real variety.  And I'm not going to drink them so it was a waste of money.  I do realize you always take a chance when ordering something that clearly tells you it's up to the distributor so I fall back to that, but I agree with the other reviewers.  If you are looking for flavored coffee variety, this isn't it.

review/summary: Great Sampler Pack
review/text: Exactly as the description says, this is a MIX.  I got everything from coffee, hot chocolate, iced teas, hot teas, decaf, etc.  Great way to try 35 different cups. Sure there were a few I wouldnt want, but thats what friends w/Keurigs are for, right? :)
