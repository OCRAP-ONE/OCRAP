review/summary: 'CRUNCHY' and good
review/text: The last time I reviewed this product I found it to be inconsistent in texture and almost like 'outlet store' goods.  This shipment was great.  Every box contained solid bars (in the past they have been pieces for the most part) and fresh.  A good choice apparently from the right shipper.  I've used Nature Valley granola bars for years and find them the right breakfast combination - or snack time - well worth enjoying.

review/summary: Tasty, crunchy, and healthy.
review/text: Nature Valley's crunchy granola bars are a great and healthy treat.<br /><br />In this 24-pack box there are 8 of each variety, and within each wrapper are two bars.  The bars about an 1.5" wide and 5" long.  These bars are very crunchy and snap apart easily, but can be a little tough to chew if you have poor teeth.  Despite their crunchy-ness they are not dry.  Since they are not chewy they're ideal for travel and won't melt or get sticky.<br /><br />Despite offering three flavors they taste fairly similar with just a hint of peanut butter, honey, or brown sugar (depending on the flavor).  They taste very hearty and rich in grains, and they are fairly filling.<br /><br />The bars are made of all natural ingredients and contain only 190 calories per serving (2 bars).<br /><br />All in all... a great anytime snack.

It fills me up more than a candy bar and keeps me going longer. It's also my goto when I need a midnight snack. These are very crunchy, you really feel like you've had something to eat.

review/text: I LOVE these Nature Valley bars. I eat a pack pretty much every day to keep my going between classes. So, when I saw that Amazon sold this large of an amount, I decided to buy from them. Plus this variety pack has very appealing flavors! The peanut butter flavor is especially good--you can actually tell that there's real P.B. because some of it gets stuck on the inside of the wrapper. YUM! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone--especially with the cheap prices from Amazon.

review/summary: The extra energy you may need
review/text: I have been a fan of Nature Valley granola bars for years. They come in many varieties. My favorites lately have been the Peanut Butter bars, but I also like the other types. So, I was pleased to learn that Amazon now offers the bars in a variety pack.<br /><br />Certainly, Oats and Honey are a classic combination. Oats go way back. Samuel Johnson included a definition of oats in his 1755 Dictionary of the English Language. Samuel Johnson said: "Oats: A grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland appears to support the people." Little did he know that two and a half centuries later, England's colonial offspring would enthusiastically endorse oats as a food for people.<br /><br />Earlier this month, I spent a week skiing in Colorado at Vail, The ticket counters were equipped with baskets of the Oats and Honey bars provided free of charge. It was a nice gesture considering the almost $100 daily ticket price. The granola bars pack 90 calories for a single bar, and obviously double that for a two-bar pack.<br /><br />I took the Oats bars with me skiing, but I also depend on them for hiking. An extra 180 calories is what you may need to give you enough energy to get up the last 180 feet to a mountain summit. The taste is good. They do not melt. If you get tired of the Oats, there is always a choice, e.g. Peanut Butter, etc., to provide variety.

review/text: When I found out my son had a peanut allergy I thought, hmm, but I love peanut butter so much.  First we tried Almond Butter.  It was ok, but nothing like peanut butter.  It was thick and gritty and tasted ok.  Then one day I saw SunButter.  I though, sunflower seed butter, are they kidding?  But I had to try it anyways.  I tried it right away once home.  WOW!  This stuff smells good, tastes good, is creamy like peanut butter.  I actually like it MORE than peanut butter.  I've not only dipped apples and used it on bread, but also baked with it as a peanut butter replacement.  Sooooo tasty.  I first bought the kind you have to stir, but am loving this non stir kind so much more!  It bakes like peanut butter, it's creamy like peanut butter, it's tastier than peanut butter.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  I just wish it was priced like peanut butter.  They want $6.99 a jar at Albertson's so I was very happy to find it here on Amazon.

review/text: Fond of the taste, which remains strong and distinct despite the superfluous filler ingredients. If it was a little more unadulterated, I'd consider it over/against peanut butter (though Sunbutter ain't cheap). Given the fact that I have the choice of PB or this, that may be the only reason why I didn't give this a 5, as it's all relative. I prefer the "'Natural' Crunch" regardless.<br /><br />Evaporated Cane Syrup = unneeded sugar<br />Palm oil 'to prevent separation' = 'no-stir'<br />Natural Mixed Tocopherols = preservative

We are so thankful that our boys now have an option for lunches.  As a peanut butter lover, I can honestly say that the look, texture, smell, and taste are so close to peanut butter you might not even be able to tell the difference.

review/text: After reading all the great reviews on the SunButter Natural No-Stir Creamy Sunflower Nut Butter - I decided to try it myself.  While I don't think I have a peanut allergy they really don't like me very much even though I love them.  Thankfully I can eat any other nuts and sunflower nuts are one of my favorites - so it would be assumed the SunButter would be fantastic.  Maybe the original SunButter is better?  The Natural variety gets oil on the top of the jar even though it says no-stir - you do have to stir it up or you will eat a bunch of oil to start.  No big deal - as long as the taste is good.  But it is only average....the texture is kind of strange - not smooth but not crunchy either - just a little "rough".  It does taste like sunflower nuts, but probably only average nuts - not a premium tasting nut.  I hate to disagree with so many positive reviews but this product is only average in my opinion.  If you can't eat peanuts this is a good option but just don't expect a taste or texture like peanut butter.  Although average I have to say I was a bit disappointed.  But it is just one persons view.....:)

It's definitely not a "No-Stir" product though.  It does arrive separated.  The oil tends to rise to the top and so it does need to be stirred from time to time.  This is still a fabulous product.

review/text: When I discovered that I was not only allergic to peanuts, but sesame seeds, almonds, walnuts, and well...almost anything resembling nuts, I felt deprived because I could no longer eat peanut butter (a staple of mine for many years)!  Now I can eat a little Sunbutter and I'm satisfied.  When I first found out about Sunbutter, I ordered six containers of it and ate it everyday!  Now,  because I'm also sensitive to Sunflower seeds, I have to limit my Sunbutter to once a week.  Too bad!<br /><br />Anyway, I tell everyone I know who has allergic kids about Sunbutter and those who have tried it, are very happy to be able to give their kids an alternative to peanut butter that tastes very good!<br /><br />I will always have Sunbutter on hand.  My husband likes it, and he's not allergic to anything!  (Lucky guy!)<br /><br />Keep up the good work!

review/summary: LOVE Sunbutter!  peanut free yay!
review/text: Our son has a peanut allergy and his allergist gave us a sample of Sunbutter.  My husband and I are big peanut butter lovers so after taking many tries to find the right balance of healthy + taste in many different brands of Pb we find out we can't have it anymore.  I think Sunbutter is a more than just acceptible substitute.  I really like the taste my husband does too and eats it but still prefers Pb. I really don't care I haven't missed out with just Sunbutter!  Our son was two when diagnosed so he doesn't know any different.<br />Love it on toast, sandwiches,  carrots, even made a dessert or two using this instead of peanut butter.  We have a subscribe and save subscription so we never run out.  Our daughter is now almost 2 and son almost 4 we have been eating this for two years.  Sunbutter has made "normalcy" in an allergy household which for any of you with food allergies know is priceless (even to us in the house without the allergy to have a substitute) .<br /><br />Love it and it is made with palm oil and cane sugar.  I seem to remember it has similar sodium and fat contents to the Simply Jif peanut butter (Lower sodium and lower sugar) we used to buy.  It has been 2 years since I bought peanut butter though but the Sunbutter was relatively more healthy than the standard peanut butters.<br />Thank God for Sunbutter!  Thank you for making it in a plant without peanuts!<br /><br />Even if your child doesn't have an allergy but someone in their school class does try it you may like it as I do.  I also am glad it has no soy (like the soy butter) which may effect hormones if eaten in large quantities or so I've heard.<br />LOVE SUNBUTTER! :)

review/summary: Great Peanut/Nut Butter Substitute
review/text: My son is allergic to peanuts and tree nuts. I LOVE peanut butter so I've hated to miss out on all the yummy recipes with peanut butter and PB&J sandwiches.  I recently heard about Sunbutter and bought some at a local grocery store.  It exceeded my expectations.  Very tasty and a great peanut butter substitute.  You can tell it's made from sunflower seeds but it has the same satisfying "comfort" taste of peanut butter and worked great in a dessert I just made.  Both me and my son love it so much I just signed up on the Subscribe & Save!

review/summary: Tastes Great and Better for You
review/text: Sunbutter tastes great and is way better for you than peanut butter. Sunflower seeds contain more minerals and also has high levels of plant sterols. Plant sterols help remove cholesterol. Since consuming my breakfast oatmeal with yogurt, peaches, and a tablespoon of Sunbutter, my cholesterol is way down. Plus this combo tastes great, texture, sweet, sour, nutty... I ate oatmeal for years but my cholesterol didn't go down that much till I ate it with Sunbutter. This works for me, results may vary for others. Not to be construed as a health claim. Dang lawyers. Anyway, some people my be allergic at a low level I was told by my allergist, (I ate peanut butter for years but a allergy test said I was allergic to peanuts), so I stopped eating peanut butter and I felt better.

review/summary: Contains Palm Oil
review/text: I realy wish I had been able to read the entire ingredients before purchasing. I was so excited to get the no-stir sunbutter, however I was upset when I recived them and learned that it contains palm oil to prevent separation. The use of palm oil is distroying forests all over world, mainly in Indonisia. This is displacing people and killing wild animals. One such animal is the Orangutan, which is facing extinction due to the destruction of habitat for palm oil plantations. I should have gone to the sunbutter home page and found out the ingredients, as I am not able to return this product. I am sure it tastes great, I love the regular stuff. However I will not be albe to eat this knowing what is happening on the other side of the earth.

review/text: I have been subsisting on cup o noodles for the last year or so at work, KNOWING that it was rotten for me.  Now I'm not going to claim that the Nong Shim soup is health food, but at 1/2 the fat and a similar amount of sodium for 2x the food, it's very worth while.<br /><br />That said, the FLAVOR is on a whole different level as well. The noodles are tender and the veggies and chicken are actually something to look forward to finding as opposed to sad little dehydrated bits that you hope not to end up on your fork like some other soups.<br /><br />I took a bit of a chance in jumping straight to the 24 pack, but it was a GREAT decision!

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: If you're an instant-ramen connoisseur, this is the noodle you've been searching for. Bowl Noodle is far better than any other instant noodle I've had. The broth is cloudy, rich, and immensely flavorful compared to any soup, not just other instants, but surprisingly light on the tongue and stomach... much unlike the, heavy, bland dollar-a-dozen cardboard noodle. (To emphasize the difference: Top Ramen and Ichiban actually make me throw up now, just because they're too bland and... cardboard... -esque... I can stomach Maruchan if I fill it with my entire spice cabinet.) Bowl Noodle has the same punch as Campbell Hearty when it comes to taste. Two of them fill me perfectly if I'm in desperate hunger. I'll have one for a snack instead of chips because it's a lot quicker and more satisfying. I recommend these to all my ramen-eating friends and they love them to death, but they're around 5-10x more expensive than Maruchan. Every penny is worth it, though. To those who buy: you're in for a treat. Enjoy!

review/text: I am from the Philippines, a country where there is an abundance of coconuts. I miss drinking coconut water which is something that you can easily get in my country by buying fresh coconut. So, I decided to try this product hoping to get the same satisfying taste that one would get from fresh coconut water. It turned out to be a disappointment. I do not doubt that this is indeed pure coconut water but it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself.

review/summary: You couldn't pay me to drink this!
review/text: I recently started researching the benefits of drinking coconut water and consuming coconut oil daily because I have been trying to change my lifestyle from one of total nutricious abandon to healthy yet happy.  I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya's coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it's in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I've had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico's does not taste a THING like that.  I know that this has no added sugar whereas Goya adds a little and Zico is "supposedly" pure but from concentrate.  I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn't just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn't had the Goya right there to redeem itself.

review/text: After hearing good things about coconut water from friends, my wife and I bought a case of Zico from the warehouse club.  We were pretty excited to try it and let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this beverage is truly disgusting.  It has a musty smell and it's difficult to even take a drink, something just seems off.  There's a foul flavor almost immediately while taking a drink which is followed by a deplorable aftertaste that is still wreaking havoc on my taste buds almost an hour later. My wife was able to take about two drinks and I struggled to drink half the bottle and could not stomach any more.<br /><br />We were very disappointed and will be returning this awful product.

Taste.<br /><br />In-depth Review:<br />I have been drinking Zico on and off for several years.  I thought it was the best of the Vita/ONE/etc varieties.  This was back before they were bought by Coca Cola and I was also buying the boxed version.<br /><br />I bought this new bottled version without reading the details and did not realize that this new form was from concentrate.  I did not pick up on a 'plastic" taste that other reviewers had.  Rather, I just found the taste rather bland and seemingly watered down.  Who knew that it was from concentrate, and really was watered down!<br /><br />Something to also consider is whether the recent coconut craze will impact deforestation and local ecologies in developing countries where they come from.  It does not seem there are many studies done on this.

review/summary: It was a better product before
review/text: I drink a lot of coconut water.  The three best tasting brands were ONE, Vita Coco, and Zico.  Recently Zico has sold out to Coca Cola and changed it's formula.  It now comes from concentrate and does not taste as good or fresh as it once did.  It does not taste terrible by any means, but if you want fresh natural coconut water, Vita Coco is really the best.  I find the best way now to enjoy these now, is to add a bit of fresh lime juice to the bottle and shake it.  Unless Zico goes back to using fresh juice, I will not buy this product again.

review/text: frankly i don't care about the packaging, (some folks are up in arms about the new plastic bottles rather than the old tetra packs) but zico--which used to be my favorite coco water--no longer tastes as good as it once did. then i read that it's now FROM CONCENTRATE rather than being what it once was, and i don't see any reason to purchase it any longer. very disappointed.

review/text: I was quite excited to try the 14 ounce bottle of Zico coconut water and much to my dismay when it finally came and I got a chance to try it I was royally disappointed. The coconut water has a plastic bottle aftertaste and it is quite unpleasant. I had one and will never drink another... too bad I bought 2 twelve packs. Get your water in those aseptic containers, NOT PLASTIC!!!

review/summary: Good, but not the same
review/text: I've always had coconut water from the real coconuts (freshly cut right in front of me), so drinking it from a plastic bottle isn't the same. The taste feels a bit different too, but if you take it out of the bottle and drink in a glass, it doesn't remind you as much that it came from a plastic bottle :)

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: My kids enjoy drinking this, and the passion fruit flavor is a refreshing change to plain coconut water.  I give my children coconut water instead of fruit juices because it is so much more nutritious, and we also drink it as a rehydrant when we are ill instead of Gatorade or Pedialyte.  We have tried Zico, VitaCoco, and O.N.E. coconut water.  Zico is my favorite in terms of flavor diversity, and O.N.E. is my favorite in terms of packaging because each drinking box includes a small extendable straw to poke through the foil and use like a juice box- a VERY NICE non-spill feature for kids.

Maybe it is good for you, but the taste is so raunchy that I would have to be on a desert island to drink it.

review/text: Don't get me wrong, I REALLY wanted to love this as I had read so many great things about coconut water.  I was so excited when my order came.  I had some already in the fridge so it was cold.  After I had a great workout I went to grab my coconut water.  I was shocked at how disgusting the taste was.  I tried it again, I tried it over ice, I tried it through a straw and nothing made it taste palatable.  If you haven't had coconut water before try one first before you buy a case.  My next step is going to try and mix it with a variety of liquors and see if I can stomach it.  Good luck!

review/text: If you dont like mangos, you will not like this drink. It does not taste like an "organic" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the "essence of mango" you would smell from an air freshener. This does mix pretty well with cold rum.<br /><br />I would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it. This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries. I cant really explain why either.

review/text: I've tried a lot of brands of coconut water, and have found that I like Zico pure coconut water the best. It has a clean refreshing taste that's not too overpowering. The 11oz boxes are what I normally drink.<br /><br />This product(14oz bottles) cannot compare to the box. The tast is absolutely horrible. Way too thick and sugary. It's almost as if they drained a bunch of old coconuts that had been sitting too long. I would advise anybody who enjoys the 11oz box to stick with that and stay away from this joke of a product. Nasty.

review/summary: What have they done????
review/text: I'm from the Caribbean and now live in the United States.  Since I can't get fresh coconut water where I live I order it from Amazon all the time...every few weeks or so.  My wife thought I was crazy at first, but she came to acquire a taste for coconut water and so I order some for her as well.  I loved the zico in the 11oz cartons.  I also like O.N.E; vita coco isn't bad either.  I figured that if I like zico in the 11oz carton, why not order the 14oz bottle?  Big mistake... unlike the product in the 11oz carton, this bottled stuff absolutely misrepresents authentic coconut water.  It has an after taste like sour milk.  I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.  I hope zico stops making their "new" product from concentrate, and gets back to what made their coconut water such a wonderful product in the first place.  Hope you don't make the same mistake that I did.

review/text: I was sooo initially excited about pre-ordering on amazon.com before it was available.  Then someone posted a not so good review from this same product in store and I was concerned.  Customer service said non-returnable item once shipped because it is considered perishable item.  My order just came, and boy am I ssooooooo DISAPPOINTED.  Smells funny, tastes salty.  Not same formulation.  Zico should have disclosed new formulation.  Before stumbling on Zico, me and my girlfriend did numerous taste tastes with the other brands.  I will try to hunt down Harvest Bay Coconut Water.  That brand was very comparable to the old Zico.<br /><br />I was a ZICO fan, but this new formulation just is grossly disappointing.

I should have read the reviews for the Zico in the plastic bottles, but it never occurred to me that the same brand could be so different. This isn't even close to the same taste. It's disgusting. I can't even describe how bad it is. Something like liquid plastic flavor with slight fermentation. AWFUL! Please do not order this product if you think you like Zico coconut water in the Tetra Paks. If anyone tried this they would think coconut water is the most vile substance on earth.

review/text: My husband loves coconut water. We were ordering via "subscribe and save" the boxes of Zico, but when we saw the bottles of Zico in the store, he wanted to switch because he wanted a larger quantity at one time - he takes them to work and all of his games. He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the "from concentrate" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying "top dollar" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the "liquid" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our "subscribe and save" order. We our going to Henry's this week to purchase a variety of coconut waters and will "subscribe and save" to another brand that uses the real stuff!

This Zico with Passion Fruit is my favorite and seriously helped my through some HORRENDOUS morning sickness.  It tastes fresh and crisp with no off flavors or aftertaste.  I would put the 11 ounces on ice with a bit of chilled water in a huge cup and sip it all day, adding more water as the day went on until I was just drinking water.  If I tried drinking plain water I would retch immediately so this was a great help.  Also nice to get some electrolytes to help with dehydration.

review/text: Many popular sports drinks have a lot of sodium and glucose as well as other electrolytes and stuff. Their flavoring frequently is nasty.<br /><br />ZICO Coconut Water on the other hand is water with a pleasant coconut flavor and a natural blend of sugars and nutrients found within green coconuts. There's far less sodium than in other sports drinks, lots of potassium, and it can also be mixed with fruit juice to add some nice flavor to complement it (mango and orange are good additions).<br /><br />After raking leaves for a few hours in the hot Florida sun, this stuff not only tastes better, it seems to hydrate faster as well, I feel refreshed and ready for more work quicker than with the regular sports drinks.

review/text: I wanted to try this out because I've heard a lot of good things about Coconut Water and it sounded sweet and tasty.<br /><br />However...it's surprisingly bitter and not...very good at all. I am basically forcing myself to finish the bottle. Adding a spoonful of sugar has actually helped it a lot. Regardless, I highly recommend tasting a bit of it before you buy any large amount. It's probably an acquired taste, and not for me.
