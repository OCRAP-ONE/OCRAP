review/summary: Really not that good in my opinion.
review/text: I bought these because I imagined they would be like Cola-flavored sour patch kids. Soft, chewy, sour, & delicious. Oh what a dream come true that would have been :)<br /><br />But sadly, thats all it will remain for me. A dream...<br />You see, as soon as I took my first bite I knew I had made a mistake.<br />This gummy is too difficult to chew... In fact, it reminds me of a poorly cooked stake. By the time you swollow a bite all the flavor has been lost...<br /><br />No one likes chewing tough steak, because it's like chewing meat flavored bubble-gum. Only, instead of spitting it out in the end, you swollow it. Well in this case you have a similar issue. Once you're tired of chewing it, you just wanna spit it out. Why bother with the extra calories?<br /><br />What I mean is, halfway through chewing- the flavor & sourness is lost and so is the willpower for me to eat the rest...

review/text: I used to buy coffee from a small private roaster and adored their "Sweet Brazilian Yellow".  Since they went out of business I've been trying to find a replacement.  This isn't it!!<br /><br />I bought whole beans.  When I opened the bag they looked old and dry to me.  I ground the amount I usually use for my 4 cup drip coffee maker.  There was no rich aroma while brewing.  The resulting beverage barely had any taste at all.<br /><br />I tried using more coffee the second day and it left a strange,  kind of bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />I definitely will not be buying any more of this coffee!!

review/text: I've enjoyed preparing the dry version of this product and have so far found the individual packages an easy way to enjoy a salad. My disappointment was to order this April 14th, receive it about a week later, then discover on the packaging that the expiration date is June 9th. I would have hoped for a little longer safe use of this product. Maybe providing the average shelf life of an item might be helpful when offering food items on the internet. Thanks--still a good deal and tasty.

I'm a born and raised in So Cal gal and I've been many times to Mexico, Central, and South America and tasted so many hot sauces it's amazing my tongue hasn't fallen out. But hands down, nothing has ever compared to Pico Pica hot sauce. The flavors are a perfect blend, so that you get just the right amount of heat while still tasting all the wonderful chili flavors. Try it, you'll fall in love with this red bottle of delishiosity. Ok, maybe I made up the word, but it certainly describes just how yummy this is.

This is a good general use sauce in that it is lively without being excessively hot.

review/summary: Good tasting and good price
review/text: I am trying to eat more organic and natural for health purposes.  Last year I stopped using sugar in my coffee and started using agave.  I don't find it as sweet in the coffee, though that doesn't make sense because it's wonderful as a syrup and very sweet.  Anyway, I love hazelnut coffee and hazelnut creamer.  I can't find organic flavored creamer so when I saw this agave I decided I would use this in my coffee for that added hazelnut flavor and then replace my hazelnut creamer with organic half and half (non-flavored).  I'm not sure when else you might use this product but it is good for coffee if you like hazelnut.  And the price as a case from Amazon is cheaper than buying them individually in the store (when you are lucky enough to find it).  I didn't give it 5 stars because my coffee isn't quite what it used to be and because the agave is still a little pricey in my opinion.  But, overall it is a good buy.  (Update:  I meant to give it 4 stars but see it has 5.  I'm unable to change it when editing my review but 4 is what I give it, primarily due to it's price.  Amazon's price is better than store prices but it is pricey overall.)

review/summary: Terrible artificial taste to it
review/text: Original Review (03-08-12)<br /><br />First off, I love and use regularly other Madhava products - both light and dark regular agave syrups as well as coconut sugar. I eat almost entirely organic foods and really needed a more affordable hazelnut flavoring for my coffee. Currently, I am using Flavorganics Hazelnut, which is EXACLTY the flavor I love, but I was looking for something a little more affordable.<br /><br />The taste is just off. And it isn't the agave. I love both light and dark agave from Madhava. It has a chemical or artificial taste to it and I couldn't do more than two sips of coffee to tell I needed to get rid of the entire 6-pack. I am going to see if Amazon will take them back, even if I have to pay shipping, because I think it is offensively bad.<br /><br />The Flavorganics has actual organic hazelnut extractives, which taste like real hazelnuts, like the ones in Justin's hazelnut nut butter.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Updated Review (03-10-12)<br /><br />I notified Amazon that I was extremely displeased with the quality of this product. Even though it is clearly not the fault of Amazon nor their responsibility to ensure I am happy, they went out of their way to make me an even happier customer than I normally am. I mean, we spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon, easily, and I think it is one of the best companies in the world. If we can't find it on Amazon or at Trader Joe's, then we probably don't need it.<br /><br />I still think this product is terrible, and I have always thought that the starred reviews should reflect ONLY the quality of the product, for better or worse. However, I figure the words of the review can stray from that requirement.

review/summary: Customer for Life!!
review/text: I will ALWAYS keep at least one flavor of Amoretti syrup in stock from now on! The recommended 1.5 pumps for a cup of coffee is indeed the perfect amount of sweetness for a regular cup of coffee...and after exhausting my first bottle, I can't get my coffee to taste right with regular sugar anymore. This syrup is not sickeningly sweet, true to its word on not curdling the cream, and has a good flavor.<br /><br />The amaretto flavor is good, but it MIGHT be slightly weak. I say 'might' because I was using this everyday and might've just been used to the flavor. I want to try some other flavors, but will definitely order this again and see if I feel different if I'm not using exclusively this one on a daily basis. I personally would prefer a slightly stronger flavor, but (if my taste buds weren't tricked and it truly was weak) some customers might prefer a milder flavor and this would be a nice change from your conventional vanilla. I should point out that in a recent episode with self-serve syrups, I had to put MANY pumps before I could taste anything at all in my coffee and still had to resort to regular sugar...I think it was Big Train being offered...this was no where near that weak.<br /><br />It comes in a nice looking bottle that doesn't look hideous on your countertop should you want/need to leave it out, and the pump is a really good quality pump with flawless performance....it's also INCLUDED! All of the other syrup brands I saw want you to buy a pump separately (scoff). The bottle and pump are definitely worth upcycling--I'm using spent bottles for shampoo and other bath products as these look much nicer behind a revealing glass door than what the products come in...plus the pump is perfectly practical in the shower.<br /><br />The company really does have excellent customer service and treated me like there was no order too small (a lost art I think). I will gladly be a loyal customer of Amoretti for olive oil and syrup and any other discoveries to come!! I will continue to try more flavors and products as well as additional uses (still anxious to try an Italian soda!)

review/text: The jello gets a five star rating, but the price isn't a deal.  I didn't do the math before I purchased this from Amazon, but I checked my supermarket for its price afterwards.  The supermarket sells it for 65 cents, and the Amazon  price for this item works out to 86 cents a box, so I guess I won't be buying it from Amazon again.

review/summary: Love the gold!
review/text: I must admit I was totally and completely addicted to honey before these came along. Now it's even worse. Easily portable and packable, these suckers are awesome! Ingredients are simple, healthy, and effective.<br /><br />Unless I'm blind I did not see an ingredient list on the product page so here ya go (note that this is the GOLD flavor only):<br />honey, pure water, potassium citrate, salt, maltodextrin, niacinamide (Vitamin B3), calcium panthothenate (Vitamin B5), pyridoxine hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), riboflavin (Vitamin B2), thiamine mononitrate (Vitamin B1), cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)<br /><br />That's it! Honey for carbs, water to thin it down for easy consumption, salt for lost sweat, and B-Vitamins for the metabolism and immune system. With a taste like real honey, quality ingredients, and a decent price these are a must buy!<br /><br />Well that's all I've got to say about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010TGK18">Honey Stinger Gold Energy Gel, 1.3-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 24)</a>

review/summary: Can't stomach running goos? This is for you.
review/text: I'm a distance runner and had a lot of trouble finding a gel product (or any product, for that matter) that I could hold down.  GU, Cliff, Hammer, etc., EVERYTHING came back up or made me extremely bloated.  I finally resorted to using the KFC honey packs on a recommendation from a friend - and they worked.  I found Honey Stingers a years back before they were readily available and ordered them off of their website, as they were much more substantial than the KFC version.  I can keep these down, they don't upset my stomach at all, and they are the perfect pick-me-up during a run.  As an extra, they taste good and are easy to suck down, After a little research I found that honey is pre-digested by bees, so I guess that's why it works better for me.  If the "mainstream" gels upset your stomach or leave a little something to be desired, try these.  You can't go wrong.

review/text: There is one store in town that has honey stingers, and right before all the major bike rides, it sells out of the Honey Stinger Golds.  These boxes keep me from worrying about having enough when I need them.  And honey stingers are so much better than the other energy gels, whose taste & texture don't agree with me.

review/summary: good ingredients, good taste
review/text: I bought a box of Honey Stingers to use during and after hard running workouts. I have a general policy for foods: if I can't pronounce an ingredient, I won't eat it. Thus, I stick to whole foods, and avoid processed foods with fillers, starch, preservatives, and other garbage. For commercial energy gels, Honey Stingers are about the closest thing I could find. All good ingredients, other than the maltodextrin. But it's much more convenient than making my own gel.<br /><br />Oh, I love the taste too. It's a nice texture and consistency. I prefer it over Cliff Shot and Gu.

review/summary: Works, but tasted terrible.
review/text: I received one of these in a goodie bag at one of my recent cycling races. Being that I don't consume new, untested products during races, I kept it in the bag and brought it home. The other day I had a group ride and realized I had run out of my usual homemade gel, which I keep in flasks. I instantly remembered the Honey Stinger packet I had received a few races ago (2-3 weeks prior) and went searching for it. A little over an hour and a half into the ride, as the pace began to wind down for the turn around, I found the opportunity to try this gel out for the first time. First thought was, okay this looks and tastes like honey, and then after a second, the taste turned into what I can only describe as medicine. I had not gulped down the whole packet, and unfortunately could only muster enough courage to down about half of the packet before I gave up and folded the packet up, putting it half full, back into my jersey pocket. Needless to say I was disappointed.<br /><br />The gel did work well, I must say. But I can not get past the taste. I love the taste of honey, though it still does seem a bit too sweet to be gulping down, even on those hard rides, but this tasted like honey mixed with medicine. I hate to give products a negative review, but I just had to share my experience. 3/5 for me, because it did work, it just wasn't very elegant about it.

review/summary: Great product when cycling
review/text: I tried one of these for the first time on a charity bike ride - I figured if it upset my stomach, at least it wasn't a race.  I'm glad I did.  It really pumped up my energy on the last 15 miles, when I really needed it!  It definitely didn't make my stomach upset, and it's much more convenient to intake than the Honey Stinger jellies.  In fact, I don't even do the jellies anymore, just this.  Personally, I like the chocolate flavor. May I suggest before you commit to a case of 24, purchase one of each flavor at a local bicycle shop to see if you can tolerate it and to see which flavor you like the best.

review/summary: try them before you buy a case
review/text: I am a huge fan of the Honey Stinger Waffles, both as training fuel and as a (reasonably) healthy, low-cal snack. The gels are much, much sweeter than the waffles - they taste pretty much like straight honey. I don't have trouble digesting them (and apparently a lot of athletes with GI challenges swear by them), but to me they are pretty cloying after an hour or 2. Would definitely recommend finding a single gel at a B&M retailer before you end up with 22 of them gathering dust in your pantry.

review/summary: Best Gel I've used
review/text: I've been a runner for many years, and I simply can't eat before exercising.  Because of this, I've come to rely on gels to keep me going during a long race.  I've tried various flavors of just about every brand out there.<br /><br />Over the past year or so I've been trying harder to eat more 'natural' foods.  It's not an obsession, just substitutions where possible.  I didn't think that energy gel was something I would be able to find in a natural form, but a friend pointed me to Honey Stingers.<br /><br />Honey Stingers are about as close as you can get, honey with just a few necessary additives.  Personally I love honey, so these taste amazing to me. I would take the 'gold' flavor over other energy gels anytime.  The 'ginsing' was also tasty, though I can't really describe the exact flavor.  I prefer the gold, though, because it doesn't have caffeine.<br /><br />I found these to be easy to eat, only slightly thicker than GU gels.  I chase with water, but I didn't necessarily need to.  I didn't run into any problems with the honey crystallizing or anything else like that.<br /><br />I highly recommend giving these a try, even if you're not looking for 'all natural.'  If you like honey you'll love these, and they're only slightly more expensive than other gels (actually cheaper than some brands).  Don't try something new on race day, but grab a few of these for a training run and you might end up hooked like me.

review/text: I love honey so these gels were a great choice for me while running. I don't cramp with these. I got the gold flavor because it is plain, the others sounded gross. I am very small and petite so I only slurp down half at a time and drink to wash it down. The gel definitely gives that extra "oomph" I need while running. Try these out. If you don't want such a big pack you can purchase individually on the honey stinger website. Enjoy!

Actually, a little less thick than the honey sitting in the cabinet at the house. Not near as thick and gooey as the vanilla bean Gu that I've tried, and not near as sweet. I'm not a big fan of sweets, and so far, the gels I've tried all taste like cake frosting to me, which I don't like when I'm running. I'll update later on the energy level and how it does during a run.

review/text: I love the Honey Stinger Organic Waffles for long workouts.  So I assumed that these would be great too and bought a case of the Honey Stinger Gold Gels.  I should have read more closely because I did not realize that this is basically a shot of pure honey with some additives.  While I like honey on different things, it is way too sweet to me to take straight as an engergy gel.  They do work fine once you get them down, but the hard part for me is getting them down at all.  I even tried mixing them directly into a water bottle but that tasted like medicine.  So I will stick with the GU and Hammer Gels.

review/text: What could be better than a mouth full of honey with a caffeinated kick?!  The price for Honeystinger seems more justifiable compared to other gels as they're made using 100% made in the USA bee pee.  Other gels use corn based products which means they're dependent more heavily on petroleum based industrial agriculture (the price of a pound of maltodextrin--the main calorie containing ingredient in Gu and others-- hasn't even remotely kept pace with inflation thanks to farm subsidies... but it's price has paralleled the price of oil).<br /><br />I'm still not keen on the little gel packs and prefer to buy bottles and use refillable flasks instead.  Also, the honey is of course really, really sweet (so delicious!) which makes it more difficult to get down smoothly.

review/text: For distance running (up to a marathon) I've tried Gu, Cliff Shots and Honey Stingers. Stingers definitely taste better and are easier on the stomach than the other two. The package is also easier to open than Gu during a run when my hands are sweaty or I have gloves on, though it is larger than a Gu pack (1.3 oz to Gu's 1.1).  Cliff Shots seem to be the MOST natural of the three ingredients wise but they don't taste as good as Stinger.<br />My final advice - try all three and see what you like.

review/summary: Excellent rice, nice packaging.
review/text: My family just loves this healthy Forbidden and organic rice. We now eat it 4-5 times weekly and it has become a real staple in our diets. The rice is NOT chewy like brown rice but is just as healthy. It also tastes great! I love it, my wife loves it, the kids even like it. In fact, my 20 month old eats it everyday and loves it! Highly recommended and rest assured the quality from Lotus Foods Organic has been excellent (after at least 5 separate orders of this 11lb bag as well as other packaging from Amazon).

review/text: Ask a Chinese friend about "forbidden rice" (&#31105;&#31859;), unless they are history buff like myself, they will give you a puzzled look.  The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice.  I will not going to bore you  with history here.<br /><br />The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta.  We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat.  "Forbidden rice?"<br /><br />There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.<br /><br />What is sold as "forbidden rice" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.  But is the ink FDA approved?  We do not know.  The label does not say.<br /><br />I am returning mine to Costco.  I will ask Costco to pull it off the shelf.

review/text: I wanted to love this. I was even prepared for it to be somewhat like a cheap Circle K Cappuccino. Unfortunately, the product itself is really greasy. You actually see grease in the cup. It is 80 calories per serving and the taste it really really powder tasting, like powdered milk.  I wasn't expecting a Starbucks Cap out of the K-Cup, but I was expecting a little more than this.<br /><br />I read the reviews and they were sort of mixed, so I chose to try it, but I won't buy these again. They will sit on the top cupboard shelf till i am desperate I guess or throw them away. Three boxes of them... EESSSH<br /><br />I also now realize these aren't eligible for return... so that sucks.

VERY comparable to the machine cappuccino, sweet, smooth, good flavor.  For under $10 a box it comes to around .40 a cup which is great compared to the $1.30+ at the store.
