review/text: Hate!!! the new cytomax with stevia.  If I wanted weird sweeteners like stevia, I could buy Hammer products, which I also despise.  You have lost my business cytomax, and I'm really bummed because you had one of the few products that didn't upset my stomach.

review/text: Been using this product for over 10 years on long distance rides, including centuries.  Have tried them all.  As another reviewer said, this isn't a "tasty" drink to have on the patio, but if you want to keep your legs from cramping, this stuff WORKS!!  I won't go on a long ride without it.

review/summary: Good product
review/text: Cytomax is a good recovery drink that doesn't have as much sugar as Gatorade.  I like the fact that it reduces the lactic acid build up.  I ran the San Francisco marathon and they gave out Cytomax.  After the marathon, I was not as sore as I usually am the day after.  I think it was due to the Cytomax.  The bottled form is better than the powdered form.  The tropical fruit flavor taste like punch.

review/summary: New formula - Yuk!
review/text: Unbeknownst to me, the new formula was shipped to me. I used to love this stuff. It worked great and tasted palatable. I usually use less powder than what they recommend since I need a lot more water than other people. Now they've used stevia as the sweetening agent and the product is bitter and nasty tasting. It was so bad I thought the batch was off and was going to return it as defective! Then I saw the mention of stevia on the label. Oh...that explains it.  That stuff doesn't taste sweet at all. It's worse than old school saccharin. Also they lowered the amount of calcium and changed other ingredients. It sounds like they reformulated to reduce costs. I can't use this rubbish. I want my money back and I'll have to try something else.

review/summary: Definitely reduces cramping while giving you energy
review/text: I've been using Cytomax while bicycling for about 10 years and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Before Cytomax, I mainly used Gatorade and I would often get very painful leg cramps on long rides, especially on hot days. Since switching to Cytomax, I get cramps only occasionally, usually when I'm not drinking enough.<br /><br />I mix 1.5 measures of Cytomax in a 24 ounce water bottle, which is less than the recommended amount. Some of the reviewers have mentioned that Cytomax doesn't dissolve easily, but if you should not have a problem if you add the Cytomax to a bottle that is half filled with water so that it doesn't clump, then shake the bottle vigorously, and then add water to fill the bottle. Before drinking give the bottle a few shakes to distribute anything that's settled to the bottom.<br /><br />Taste is the most important thing when selecting an energy drink. Whatever your choice, it doesn't have to taste great, but it does have to be acceptable. If you don't like the taste, then you probably won't be drinking enough and your performance will definitely suffer as a result. I use the Cool Citrus flavor. Over the years, I've gotten samples of other flavors, some of which were OK and some that I did like at all. So if you're unsure about the flavor, try to get a sample from someone before you buy a 1.5 or 4.5 pound container.<br /><br />On long rides, I carry two bottles on my bike. For very long rides, I'll also carry zip lock bags with measured amounts of Cytomax so I can refuel as needed.<br /><br />In Summary: A great product.

review/summary: Easy on the stomach, tastes great
review/text: I bought Cytomax as fuel for a 50K (31 mile) run I went on.  Gatorade is rough on my stomach, even when I dilute it, but I had no problem with the Cytomax full strength.  It's thicker than most sports drinks, a lot more like drinking juice.  I thought it tasted great, but the important thing was being able to stomach it on the long haul.<br /><br />It was noticeably helpful.  I did one six mile loop without a drink along from miles 15-21, and I crashed for the last 2 miles of that loop.  Some Cytomax and Oreos and I was recovered and ready to pick the pace back up in 15 min.

review/text: The new formula is horrible.  Gave me bad, BAD stomach issues the entire day after taking it.  So I tried it again just to make sure.  Yep, same thing.  Stevia is NOT natural, and should not be marketed as such.  If I wanted caffeine, I would have bought one of the 1000+ caffeinated supplements out there.  Very disappointed in both the manufacturer and in the seller for not pointing out the change in formula.

review/summary: New formula might be crap.
review/text: I've been using a tub of the tangy orange flavor for the last 6 months and its been great. Pretty good flavor, no bad aftertaste, seems to have performance and recovery benefits.<br /><br />I ordered tropical fruit the other day and I'm not sure what to think. I read a review that said some flavors taste like soap. I didn't believe this, but here I sit, with a soapy aftertaste in my mouth. I'm not sure I want my mouth to taste like soap 50 miles into a bike ride.<br /><br />This new batch is CytoSport's new formula with Stevia. I don't know if the tropical fruit flavor tastes bad, or if the new formula tastes bad, but its certainly terrible. I don't think stevia tastes like soap, so I'm confused about the flavor.<br /><br />Please fix this CytoSport, I wanted to be a fan.

review/summary: Great until they added Stevia
review/text: As a marathoner, century cyclist, and half-ironman triathlete, I've used my fair share of sports mixes.  I've been a faithful Cytomax user for several years and find that it helps me feel less sore after hard training and is easy on my stomach.  However, I noticed that my most recent bottle of Cytomax states that it includes "Stevia".  Stevia has only recently been approved by the FDA and is still not approved in Europe, and is not, as it is frequently marketed, always a natural product.  The plant itself is natural, but when used as a sweetener it needs to be treated and "messed with" to make it sweet and mask it's bitterness.  It's safety has also been debated, and given the large quantities of sports drink that I consume, that's enough for me to switch products.

review/summary: Best Flavor, little Salt
review/text: There is a misunderstanding of what drinks should include and that can be best answered by choosing the drink that best suits your sport.  Long distance, high intensity sports need calories, salts and proteins. Weekenders rarely need calories and salts, unless they live in a high humidity area and sweat considerably.  Salts should include potassium, calcium but little sodium.  Sugars in the form of glucose or sucrose should be added but not to excess.  Stay away from corn syrups and corn additives. Having said all that, most drinks that are low in sodium salts, and neutral on calories (sugars/proteins) will provide enough nutritive additions to you while you exercise.  Keep in mind that one of the reasons you exercise is to loose weight.  If you add a bunch of calories while your exercising, your weight loss will be for naught. Stay away from sugar bars and  caffeine unless your a long distance runner and or cyclist. This CytoSport drink is a good choice for the average sportive  who does not need to supplement their diet on a routine basis.  It is also good for the high intensity sportive when they also supplement their diets with high energy food while they exercise.

review/summary: THE sports drink
review/text: I have been using this product for several years since I discovered it on Amazon.  I have GERD (esophageal reflux disease) and I can't drink formulations that either have too much sugar or too much acid.  This drink does not set me off like some of the other flavors do.  I has a very pleasant apple flavor, that you swear is real apple juice.  I usually mix two measuring cups (included) into a 70oz Camelback and place it into the fridge for my next day's ride.  The drink will stay cool for two hours.  This product does have sugars, although not much.  It has about 90 calories per measure, which is enough for a good ride around town.  If you are a marathoner, then you will need more calories and may need to suppliment your drink with power bars.  But this is enough for us casual riders.  If you don't want the calories, then you can decrease your measurements accordingly.  This is the only drink for me and I hope they never take it off the market.

review/summary: Cytomax is a great product.
review/text: I have used every energy drink and mix, every refreshing drink and mix, every replacement of salts and minerals drinks and mixes I have been able to find.  I have searched the Internet and found many drinks and mixes that claim they can replace what your body used while exercising and or in some hot athletic endeavor.  I get cramps throughout my body when I exercise, play racquetball, or am exercising on a 100+ degree day. All other products have failed in different degrees and I would still cramp up at some time. Cytomax is the only product I have used that will keep the cramps away and keep me active and playing. For me, there is no other product to use.

review/summary: How To Not Cramp
review/text: PROS:<br />- Works to prevent cramps from lactic acid.<br />- Tastes good.<br />- Dissolves easily.<br />- Lower sodium than other electrolyte products.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- More expensive than water.<br />- Heavier to carry than electrolyte pills.<br /><br />As an avid athlete for the past 30 years (mountain biker, long distance trail runner, backpacker), I didn't need an electrolyte replacement supplement until I was diagnosed with congenital hypertension and had to take a diuretic along with BP meds. The diuretic did me in on hot, sunny days during a long run or long mountain bike ride. U suffered cramps from built-up lactic acid in my muscles, a new experience for me. I could no longer run 10 miles or mountain bike 20-25 miles without replenishing my electrolytes. Even eating every half hour with water didn't cut it.<br /><br />Enter CytoMax, which I initially received as a freebie at triathlons and races. What a difference! It works great! During the summer, I'll bring along a water bottle filled with CytoMax. Its sodium content is lower than other electrolyte drinks. Its taste is easy to swallow and refreshing, unlike some of the others, too. I haven't suffered another cramp since I started using CytoMax. As recommended by the manufacturer, I drink it 30 min into my activity, and then sip it every so often till it's gone.<br /><br />I've not have a single problem with dissolving or clumping using this technique. The night before, I add about 1/4 cup of chilled water to my water bottle. I add 2 scoops Cytomax. I add more chilled water to make 14 oz fluid. Shake ~30 sec. Refrigerate overnight. The CytoMax granules completely dissolve, leaving no residue using this method. The next morning, if it's hot & sunny, I might add a few ice cubes before I hit the trails.<br /><br />BOTTOMLINE: It works. It tastes good. I'd buy it again.

I give it a 1 star for taste and 5 stars for how it works.  If they wanted to introduce a low calorie option then they should have created a new product and not change the old product.<br /><br />My solution for the taste is to add some sugar... tastes great.  Every 32oz of water I use 3 scoops of cytomax and then I ad 1 TBSP of sugar (2 if you want it super sweet).  Hope it helps you too.

review/summary: Really helps me - 42 year old weekend warrior
review/text: I'm a bit out of shape and getting back into shape hasn't been easy with all the soreness. A friend recommended Cytomax and it has really helped. While exercising I can do more reps than in the past and when I get 6 or 7 sets deep into my workout my reps only fall off slightly compared to before I was trying Cytomax. The other day I did a workout that I'd done 2 weeks before but this time I did not use Cytomax and the soreness that I am experiencing today is unpleasant to say the least. My experiment showed me that without using Cytomax I get considerable soreness the following day(s) whereas when I did use Cytomax I had relatively little soreness. Until I get back in shape I think I'm going to need this crutch. I'm 42 years old so that means that I experience a lot more soreness than a younger athlete. Someone younger and in better shape may not notice such a difference.

This one is by far my favorite, I use it for anyworkouts that go longer than 90 minutes and it helps keep my energy up without bonking.  Recommend this to anyone, I would also use the subscribe and save feature that will keep the product coming and give you a good discount

review/summary: Does what it's supposed to do, and does it effectively.
review/text: I'm not an endurance cyclist/runner, but I was pointed to this by one. I was looking for a carbohydrate/electrolyte product more effective than Gatorade, mainly for lifting, and occasionally cardio-intensive sports.<br /><br />I don't have any grand insight to offer, but can vouch that it does what it's supposed to do. I'm able to work out longer (~2 hours on a consistent basis) without experiencing symptoms of dehydration now, than when I didn't take this and either drank only water, or water and Gatorade (feeling mild nausea + dizziness past ~1.5 hours).<br /><br />It should also be noted that there's drastically less sugar/sodium per gram of carbs in this than Gatorade. This might not be important to everybody, but another of the reasons I wanted an alternative to Gatorade is that sodium is a migraine trigger for me.<br /><br />Cool Citrus tastes like soap, Tropical Fruit tastes like shampoo. Both of these tastes are mild, and between them I prefer the Tropical Fruit.

review/summary: Great Product ... poor followthrough by Seller
review/text: I have used several energy/recovery/hydration drinks in the past (Gatorade, Heed, etc.), and Cytomax seems to provide the best solution for me.  I play soccer regularly and am older (in my 50's).  Since moving to Phoenix I have found that I am pretty much nutrient starved and dehydrated by the end of play and suffer from lactic acid build up.  The night I play and the next day take their toll on me.  I've found that these effects are greatly reduced if I drink Cytomax during and shortly after play.  For post recovery I usually take in 30 to 40 grams of protein (muscle milk or protein powders) and find this definitely reduces post-exercise "pain."  I believe in this product. It also keeps my energy level up as I play.<br /><br />However, I recently purchased Cytomax from Direct Supercenter.  I made the purchase on May 2.  On May 9, I received a note from Amazon that no shipment had yet been made.  I contacted the seller through Amazon asking about shipment and an expected delivery date, only to get a request asking about my experience in purchasing the product.  Okay ... two-and-a-half  weeks later, still no word from the seller about shipping, so I finally cancelled the order (May 18). This is a common product.  I am greatly dissatisfied with the seller and will no longer conduct business with them.  As for Cytomax, I think it's a great product.

review/text: I am very happy with Cytomax.  I typically swim ten miles a week and hence focus a lot on my rehydration and electrolyte replacement, Cytomax meets those needs perfectly.  I mix up 32 ounces for a typical workout drinking about half before and rest after.  It is sweet and tasty but not sugary like Gatorade which I found did not meet my needs.  Great product and haven't found it cheaper anywhere else.

review/text: first exposed to this product at the RnR NOLA Marathon - it was the sponsored beverage on the course.  It piqued my curiosity so I decided to give it a try.  Been using it for over a month now on a regular basis and really love it.<br />Have tried the GoGrape and Tangy Orange (I think that's the name) and the orange one has a stronger flavor in that the flavor is more present.  The GoGrape is a little less present.  They're both tasty though.  With the orange I use 1 scoop for training and the recommended 2 scoops for races and flavor is great - 1 scoop doesn't taste weak or watered down (despite actually being watered down).  With grape, unless I use 2 scoops it tastes weak.

review/summary: Good for the Gym and No Caffeine
review/text: I use this every time I go to the gym. It's one of the better tasting powders and it allows me to drink coffee (which I like), for caffeine, and then rely on this Cytomax for energy throughout the workout, plus ease the acid build-up in the muscles that can make you want to puke. Make leg and intense workouts easier. I don't see the point in having the caffeine in the drink when the caffeine will not really get into the system until your workout is almost done. I tend to drink some caffeine half an hour before the workout and then use the Cytomax during the workout.

review/summary: Taste Good, Not Filling
review/text: The one thing that I look for in a drink is that it tastes good.  I know you take that for granted when you buy anything that has flavor, but I have purchased some drinks that taste like swamp water, or worse.  All of the Cytomax drinks that I have tried taste good.  Now some exercise aficionado's will swear that you need this ingredient or that protein in your drinks.  For most weekend warriors and part-time athletes all you need is a good replacement drink without a lot of salt.  Being a heart patient, I need to restrict salt in my diet. While there is still quite a bit of sodium in this drink, it is not overpowering and doesn't stay with you when you stop exercising. A little bit of salt in your drinks goes a long ways.  The Cytomax company may not be as famous as some of the big boy's, but I have used they're products for 20 years and swear by them.  And I think you will too. The other great flavor is apple.  I really like that one.

review/summary: Acid buffering works wonders
review/text: I'm 6'7 with a very short torso, mostly legs. When doing weight training on leg days, I would literally get sick to my stomach after heavy leg presses. I suspected it was do to acidification of the muscles moving into the blood stream. I did some research and found cytomax. I don't think it tastes very bad at all, if you don't like it, try a different flavor. I start drinking it about 30 minutes before workout on an empty stomach, and it seems to assimilate into the blood quickly.<br /><br />I've definitely noticed that workouts are less painful, more productive and I don't get sick to my stomach anymore. This is one product that delivers on it's promises and then some.

review/text: I started drinking cytomax at a friend's recommendation and I've never gone back to gatorade or the similar drinks.  The first thing I noticed is that its not packed with the high fructose corn syrup that's found in so many popular drinks.  Keeps me going through hours of workout or basketball with the same hydration as gatorade, if not better.  And as you're mixing it yourself at home, it ends up costing a lot less as well.

It is a tasty treat about one hour into a long bike ride.

It allowed me to ride and hike longer than originally.<br /><br />In the gym it works very well too. I am in the gym around 6am and it will help you get through a hard workout and even maybe let you work harder than you want at times because the lactic acid isn't building up as quick.<br /><br />I believe it is a wonderful product. I have tried both the tangy orange and lemonade. Both taste great but prefer the lemonade because it's a bit more subtle in taste.

I have no complaints in the taste, and I love the boost to the performance I receive.

review/summary: Cytomax is very misleading in stating and not stating ingredients
review/text: I just canceled an order for Cytomax because after researching it more on various sites, including their own, I find Cytomax to be very misleading concerning ingredients in their product.  I contacted their customer service department and the words "herbal lift" mean caffeine.  Why don't they just say what it is....caffeine?  Why do they hide the fact that certain flavors have caffeine in them?  Reason:  Some people won't buy sports drinks with caffeine in them.....me being one of those people.  Some flavors contain guarana extract.  Look it up...it has a very high caffeine content.  In summary, I simply don't trust Cytomax as a company.  If I have to search for the truth, it's the same as them not telling the truth to me.  To try to bring my impressions to conclusion, I called Cytomax on the number listed on their website and their customer service people are very evasive or not able to address my questions about what is in their product to back up their anecdotal evidence listed on their website.  They transferred me to their sales manager who is an "avid cyclist", got voicemail and no return phone call.  If you want to know what you're really putting in your body, don't buy Cytomax.

review/summary: Dissatisfied with New ACS Additive
review/text: Been using Cytomax for 5 years now & have been very satisfied . . . until now.  Tried Accelerade 4 years ago, but whey, a dairy product in Accelerade, caused stomach cramping, which was why I preferred Cytomax.  Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax.  Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey.  For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey.  Who knows?<br /><br />I'm considering trying something else and would encourage the manufacturer to go back to the previous formula.  As I result, I'm cancelling my Amazon order subscription, not to mention the CA sales tax now added to the cost of buying this product from Amazon.

review/summary: Great Grape!
review/text: First I have to say that I have tried many products before Cytomax. But coming out of the gate, it was hands down a good value and a product that could keep me going for hours on my bicycle. I ride around 3500-4000 miles a year, and that isn't always easy at my age. I found this product kept me going throughout the ride and also helps with leg pains more than any other product I have tried. This summer I went on a 100 mile charity ride in 90 degree southern US temperatures and I was amazed at how well I felt at the end of the ride. My long quest for an energy supplement is done. I am about to order my third 4.5 pd jug of Cytomax. I prefer the grape above the other two I have tried (Lemonade, Tropical). I smell the grape before I drink and it makes me smile I think. I certainly drink more water because I enjoy the flavor and anything that helps to remind you to drink more while on the road is a good thing. One last thing that makes Cytomax a good value is that you can dilute the product on the not so hot days, like below 80, when you do not sweat as much. Thereby saving 50% costs of the product and still feel energized. Hope this helps!

review/text: I've been using Cytomax for a very long time now and still love it.  I mainly use it for weightlifting and it keeps my hydrated and reducing lactic acid burn to allow for a better workout.  The taste of the different flavors is good enough since you're not using this for taste.  By no means is it bad or just tolerable, but if you want taste go for the more mainstream products out there (Gatorade).  I highly recommend this for weight training as it makes a significant different for me.

review/summary: Just try it- you'll never work out agian with out it!!
review/text: I tried this stuff oh 15 years ago when I was hiking, biking, climbing, anything outdoors all the time. I thought it was a great way to stay hydrated and avoid the soreness the day after a good work out.<br /><br />But now that I am in my mid 30's and 5 kids later...I HAVE TO HAVE it!! I make a bowl of oatmeal (using water) before my rides 3 x's a week and instead of adding more water or milk I just put a squirt of the lime citrus in with my water bottle (that is going with me on my ride) and enjoy my pre work out snack. Then I drink it on my 20 mile ride and I have yet to be sore. Not that my muscles aren't "tight" I can tell that I took on some hills, but not sore so I can't use my legs the next day.<br /><br />Just try it. You can always send it back, but if you are serious about working out, sweating, pushing past the burn and tired of FEELING the burn the next day. Just get some. YOu'll be a lifer like me!<br /><br />I ran a relay race last year with 11 other woman who I have hooked on the stuff. Yeah. 11 new Cytomax groupies:)<br /><br />I mix up two scoops in my 24 oz water bottle every ride. I don't like it cold, but my sister (who like the pomegrante something) likes it chilled. To each their own.  Read up on it. It's gooooood stuff and this is the best price I've found for the 4.5 lbs size!<br /><br />Enjoy your work out!!

review/summary: Low acid, but horrible taste
review/text: I really wanted this to be good coffee since my prodigious coffee consumption is at odds with my stomach. So, in the hopes of cutting back on the Pepcid AC usage, I gave this low acid coffee a whirl since it was on sale.<br /><br />Well, the best thing I can say about the taste is that it's not the worst coffee I've ever had. Pretty close to the worst, however. It appears to be a medium/dark roast, but the roasting is uneven, with some very dark beans and some light ones. It has a strong burnt flavor and a sour aftertaste. It's drinkable, but if you won't need to worry about drinking too much - a cup or two is all you can take at a time.<br /><br />I tried brewing it in a variety of ways, and adjusted the grind level several times. Using it with a My K-cup system produced the worst results regardless of how much I tinkered with the grind. Really sour and burnt. The Senseo was a bit better - a more mellow flavor, but still not what I'd call good. The best results came with a very coarse grind and a French Press. The burned and sour taste was decreased, but still there.  Poor aftertaste (lingering sour notes) regardless of how it was brewed.<br /><br />(For the sake of a complete test I ground some ultra fine and used it for espresso. Wow - truly horrid! Granted I didn't expect it to be good since it's not an espresso blend, but it was worse than I even imagined!)<br /><br />Does it help with heartburn? Can't say for sure since I really can't drink it all day long as I would with other coffees. But there is some research out there that backs the manufacturer's claims.<br /><br />Compared with my current favorite brands (Mayorga decaf Columbian whole bean, Lavazza Gran Filtro decaf whole bean and Melitta decaf ground) this is quite poor. But, I'll give it two stars since it may be beneficial for decreased heartburn. Plus, it truly is decaf -- I'm ultra sensitive to caffeine and this passes my "can't feel any caffeine at all" test, which is not all that common these days. If I was rating only on taste it would get zero stars.<br /><br />I plan on using the rest as a mix with some flavored coffee in the hopes that the blend will minimize the sour aftertaste. Needless to say, I won't be ordering it again.<br /><br />If good coffee means heartburn, bring on the Pepcid!

Off course grinding whole beans as most will atest is just about the most wonderful flavor experience you can have with coffee. Of ourse if you're able to obtain your favorite bean & roast your 'yum' level zooms up.

review/summary: Great for Christmas Cookies
review/text: The Deb-El whole eggs taste fine in my Christmas cookies this year.  This is the first time in years that I've used powdered eggs to bake with.  The taste of the finished cookies was comparable to the product made with fresh eggs.  They are expensive but I quickly run out of refrigerator room during holiday baking season and this seems like a good solution.<br /><br />I often use something besides water to reconstitute them which gives the cookies a better flavor.  For example, I make a triple cholcolate cookie which calls for instant coffee - which I don't keep in the house.  I used brewed coffee instead of water with the egg powder and the cookie flavor was great!<br /><br />I did try using them in scrambled eggs for breakfast and was not impressed with the results.

review/summary: Belly Fat??
review/text: I have reordered this product before in 240 count. I was waiting for my appointment at Yale New Haven Hospital and viewing the hospital closed circuit TV which was explaining health tips. The topic changed to the benefits of green tea and it mentioned it's anti oxidant properties and the fact that it helps reduce belly fat!!. I do not have a real problem in this area as I am 5' 10 1/2" tall and weighed 209 lbs. After surgery I had to watch my diet and with the help of Stash Green Tea consumed cold from a 32 once thermos at least three times weekly I have lost 17 lbs and inches from my belly area. TIP; Cut the string and tab off four tea bags and place in a 32 oz. thermos, top off with filtered water. You can refill with water all day or add one or two additional tea bags while leaving the others in the thermos. Keep refrigerated if possible. Ice cubes will rupture the tea bags. Try this for three months for at least three days a week or more and see if the belly isn't flatter!!

review/text: I'm picky about my green teas. Sometimes they're too weak, sometimes it just doesn't smell/taste like green tea, or sometimes it's just horribly bitter/sour and unpalatable (think most grocery store teas).<br /><br />But Stash's green tea is TERRIFIC. There's a good element of leafyness (it IS green after all) without much bitter/sourness. I can usually pull at least 2 good cups of hot green tea from each tea bag.<br />I was actually previously disappointed by Yogi's Green tea (it's just purely green tea leaves, can't remember the exact name of it though) - when steeped in hot water it smelled like burnt tires, so I almost lost hope in American grocery store teas. I previously would only buy the Yamamotoyama green teas (slight roasted flavor) and Stash's green tea tastes remarkably similar, which makes me incredibly happy due to the Stash tea sales that have been going on at my local markets. WOO!!!

review/text: It should probably be called Lemongrass Mint to more accurately describe the taste.  It's especially good as ice tea, but drinking it hot is enjoyable too.  The mint taste is not as strong as the lemongrass.  I notice that some reviewers here say they barely taste the lemongrass, while others think it overwhelms the mint.  It's a good idea to buy a box of this tea to try it out before ordering 6 boxes.  I usually drink Bigelow Plantation Mint black tea, so I'm accustomed to a strong mint flavor.  Lucky for me that I like lemongrass too, so the balance of lemongrass and mint was not a problem for me.

Opening the tea bag, I detected an aroma reminiscent of lawn clippings. As I drank the tea, I find the unpleasant aroma becomes an unpleasant taste. I am not sure how to describe it . . . perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste. I do not get the sharp "bite" I normally expect from a good green tea.<br /><br />I will try this for a week, and see if I am missing something, but as for now, I can not recommend purchasing this tea.

review/text: I far prefer this brand of green tea over Lipton and some others I've found available at the grocery store. Good quality tea, good flavor. However, the price they are offering you to buy in bulk online is higher than buying 6 single boxes at the store. I've found this tea is always between $2 and $2.50 per box of 20. Multiply $2.50 by 6 and you get $15.00. They are asking $16.50 before shipping for the same amount. I think I'll keep buying it at the store.

review/text: So this is the first green tea ive bought and the second ive tasted. The first one i tasted was alittle better tasting. This stash green tea however does taste lets say, 'natural'. what i mean by that is it taste exactly like what it is, all natural dried herbs. It does look like leafs though not just crushed up almost powdery stuff like the other bag i drank. Im not quite sure what green tea is supposed to taste like but this one is NOT good but its NOT that bad either and its also NOT sweet at all. But hey i am drinking green tea for its health benefits not for its flavor. Overall though i DO recommend this green tea just like the name says it does appear to be premium green tea judging by how it looks and the 'natural' taste, so if your just after those health benefits you wont be disappointed if you want good taste this probably wont make you happy.

I drink this every single day at work, often using 4-5 packs a day. Fair warning: this 6-pack may not be that great of a deal, depending on where you live. I can get it at the supermarket for about $2.48 a box. To have this 6-pack work out to be a better bargain than buying local it would have to be 14 bucks per, or less. BUT, that has nothing to do with the quality of this product. The tea itself is great.

review/summary: Mildly Minty
review/text: Some mint teas are overwhelming but Stash's Morocan Mint is just mildly minty. It is made with spearmint, lemongrass, peppermint and green tea. I don't really taste anything too lemony. This has a smooth, refreshing taste that you can enjoy every day or when you are tired of tea with milk. I like this tea with one packet of stevia. It would also be great with honey. If you don't think this is strong enough use two tea bags like I do.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Pure and Not Bitter
review/text: Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long. This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma. I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia. It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors. This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea. White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine. So this particluar tea is very healthy. However you will probably drink it often because it tastes so good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: No Bitter Taste like Other Green Teas
review/text: My first impression of Stash's green chai tea is that it isn't bitter like other green teas. The spices are also mild. This tea contains green tea, cinnamon, ginger root, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil. I normally would not add milk to a green tea but adding two tablespoons of nonfat milk powder and a packet of stevia makes this tea perfectly soothing. If you don't like tea overly spicy this will appeal to you. I think it tastes better than a lot of chai teas made with black tea leaves.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: The Best of the Best!
review/text: I love Jasmine tea! More than anyone trust me. I got my first shipment of six boxes yesterday and have signed up for delivery every two months. The box it came in said "Stash" on the side. I'm assuming this tea came directly from the company. I should think it did by how cheap it is! At the grocery stores near me this tea is $3 a box on sell. This is a great deal!<br /><br />Stash is by far the best company for jasmine tea. I love this stuff! The only thing I would say to a new customer is don't reuse tea bags. Other than that, enjoy! It doesn't get better than this!

review/summary: Maybe I have a bad batch
review/text: I was a bit shocked to see all the high ratings on here, so maybe it's my box: perhaps it was mishandled. So far the two cups I've made taste like plastic and chemicals. I'll try brewing it loose leaf in case the taste is coming from the bags, but so far I found this tea disappointing.

review/summary: Mint?
review/text: This is the first STASH tea I will not purchase again. I won't be giving it away or toss it out to get rid of, but . .  where is the mint!?  Very, very mild mint flavor. With Moroccan Mint clearly plastered on the box, I really expected more flavor.
