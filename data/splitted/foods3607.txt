review/summary: Great as a base
review/text: I try to buy this when I can get it for under $3 a jar. Supermarkets usually charge me at least $4.80 or so, so I figure my rating is appropriate just because of the cost savings. This is a great alternative for anyone on a budget.<br /><br />But I also like this because it's a pretty decent base for spaghetti sauce. I don't actually eat this straight. Instead, I mix in various combinations of chopped garlic, canned diced tomatoes, black pitted olives, canned mushrooms, and whatever beef, turkey, chicken, or spam I can find whilst scrounging about. This concoction gets simmered for a while. Aging it a day or two also seems to help the flavors blend together.<br /><br />Things can be chopped up a lot or a little depending on taste. I like chunky tomato sauces. Others may see it differently. Either way, we save with this over buying the "gourmet" sauces. I used to get those, bt with a little effort I can make up something that tastes a lot better to me.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

review/summary: One of the healthiest of the Plum line
review/text: These pouches are actually worth feeding to my one year old.  Out of all of the plum organics pouches, this flavor is on of the four that is totally packed with vitamins actual nutrition due to the sweet potatoes.  Most of the other products are very low on the actual nutrients scale.  But my daughter loves these and I feel like they are actually worth the calories - she will only eat so much in a day and I want to make sure she gets the most nutritional punch per calorie possible!  The other flavors are the purple carrot, green bean/spinach and greek yogurt/raspberry spinach.

review/text: My 24 month old LOVES these packs.  He has been going through a phase of not eating veggies, so this was a way for me to get him to have some.  He recognizes the pouch when I give it to him, and he squeals in delight to get one.  He frequently asks for a pouch whenever I pick him up after work.  I think he prefers the broccoli apple, and the spinach pear ones over this, but so far, all the ones he's tried, he has liked.  Will purchase again!

Then, I found this. They eat it down. Now, instead of getting 6 cans of stuff that costs a dollar or more a can (not the Fancy Feast...that was their cheapest), they get 2 cans of expensive stuff, 3 cans of this and as much kibble as they can gobble. They are happy campers and if their fur stays shiney and the vet stays happy, I shall continue to feed this and lower my food bill. Hoorah. The kitties: Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdon, Mercy and Yellow Kitty all say "hello" and for a month have been eating this full speed ahead. So go ahead and try it out on your pussing foots.

They can be a little expensive so i have shopped around and found them to be A LOT cheaper to buy from one of the sellers on this site instead of getting them from PetCo or PetSmart.

review/summary: Doggie Crack
review/text: I bought a single Greenies Tennie for my puppy, just to see if she likes it. Surprisingly enough, she loves it. At first she just licks it curiously, then she started to grab it and take it to a corner and start licking and chewing on it. It keeps her busy for a long time. It's good for her teeth and make her have a better chewing habbit than chewing table legs and my fingers. I went out to my local pet stores to get this big pack. They price is actually the same as Amazon, I wish amazon would have this product for cheaper though.<br />But if you want your dog to be busy, help them to have better teeth, curing chewing habbit and ease seperation anxiety, you need to give this a try.<br /><br />But of course you need to becareful choosing the right size. If the treat is too small, when they woof it down, they might get chocked. The teenie is right size for my Mini American Eskimo puppy because she is really small now. When she is older I will switch to a size bigger.

review/text: Within days of starting a routine of one petite Greenie each day (my dog is 20 pounds), dog breath is gone.  It did not upset his GI tract, and he loves the taste.  The price is much more reasonable if you buy a Mega Treat Pak from a vendor online compared to a smaller amount in a pet store, although a trial with the individually wrapped ones is a good way to start out.  They arrive in slide-zipper lock bags, which helps to keep them fresh.  I recommend this product highly.

Shopping for healthy treats for my pets is something I do almost every trip to the store.<br /><br />Recently I've been giving these healthier treats to my Shih-Tzu puppy. He takes off with them, usually to his bed where he can relish them all by himself. And he does relish them.<br /><br />When I sniffed one, they smell minty and meaty at the same time. I worried at first that he might get confused by the smell and not like them. I was wrong, he loves them!<br /><br />They help scrape off tartar build up too. So why not make fewer vet appointments for teeth cleaning?<br /><br />I recommend this nutritious treat highly.

review/summary: Picture doesn't match description
review/text: I didn't actually order this but was sent it by mistake. In searching to see what might have happened, I found it and noticed that the picture doesn't match the description--and I can tell you from what I was sent, it is the description that is correct, not the picture.  That is to say, this includes Breakfast Blend and not Columbian Fair Trade. If when you read this review you see that the picture shows Breakfast Blend and not Columbian Fair Trade, you can ignore this review--I'm just putting it here to warn people not to be deceived by the picture (I plan to take this review down if the picture is changed to properly reflect what's in the box but there will inevitably be at least a delay in me doing that and perhaps I'll even just forget to do it entirely).

review/summary: My best pizza crust ever
review/text: Using this flour, I made my best pizza crust ever.  Thin, crispy and the flavor was amazing.  Antimo Caputo flour, 80 degree water, pinch of salt and yeast.  Mixed, let it set in covered mixing bowl for four hours.  Put it in the fridge over night.  Next day I pulled it out to set on counter for 2 hours.  Made a nice ball and let it set for another hour and made my crust and cooked it on a 450 degree pizza stone.  Perfection!

review/summary: makes all the difference in thin crust pizza
review/text: All I can think is I am glad I did not find this flour in the summer because I have been running my oven constantly since these little red bags arrived. I've been trying for *years* to create the perfect Naples style thin crust pizza; this flour is THE key to a perfect crust. Works very well with the recipe found in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312649940">Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in Five Minutes a Day</a>. My first batch of dough from Pizza in 5 made with this flour is so far on its seventh day and each day it's just as good if not better than the last.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: very extensible and nice to use, but pricey!
review/text: I have tried both this "Chef's Flour" as well as the "Pizzeria" flour, and I have to say I really much prefer the Chef's Flour blend more. I found this flour more extensible and easier to work with than the Pizzeria flour.  This flour didn't tear when I was stretching it, whereas the Pizzeria flour did tear every time I used it.<br /><br />But, in as much as I liked this flour, aside from getting a more 'airy' (open) crumb with it that I can't often achieve with bread flour, I didn't find it to be enough better than KAF bread flour to make enough of a difference to justify the cost.<br />It is nice flour, and its very easy to work with, but it's also too pricey for me.<br /><br />But I would recommend this flour in spite of the price difference.

review/summary: its ok but ultimately not worth it
review/text: Ok I was a big Stride Forever Fruit 1.0 fan and I bought this thinking I'd be getting the same thing. I was wrong. Yes it still does have that fruity back taste but it is different than the original. When I chewed the original that fruity taste stayed even after the sweeteners wore off; but with the 2.0 version the fruity taste only stayed when the sugar was still in it. But even so, that fruity taste was barely noticeable! On top of that all, they put too many sweeteners in the gum--- after chewing it a nasty Splenda after-taste lingers! I knew I should've kept the gum unopened and returned it....I hope Stride returns to the original formula!

review/text: There isn't a whole lot that is special about Stride Gum. I kind of got annoyed chewing it all the time. It doesn't really freshen your breath and you don't get the "clean" feeling of other gums. It doesn't really last that long either so I wasn't too fond of it. Either way if your a fan of Stride go for it.

review/summary: A Visit to the Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/text: I use a lot of bay leaves, particularly in soups and stews. Not too long ago I ran out. We'll you'd think that bay leaves would be a standard item found in almost any grocery store, but that's just not the case. I finally found this 2-ounce jar of McCormick (Gourmet Collection) Turkish Bay Leaves in the spice section of a nearby Costco Store. Well, It's really much more than I anticipated, but I use them all the time, so what the hey? When I got home I took the cap off and took a good sniff. Oh, my. What nice smelling bay leaves. Fresh and zesty! These were obviously much better than the one they replaced. I've only tried them in one soup so far but it turned out excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Years later , I saw it in the grocery store I work for and bought it for a snack occasionally. Then it was gone and I forgot about it again. A co- worker and I were talking about exotic foods one day and he brought up "Turkish Delight". That reminded me of halva and I tried to describe it. The best way was to get some so I found it at Amazon. Well, it was as yummy as I remembered. I gave several of the bars away to people who had never had them.The ones I received were huge! My only complaint is that now the nutritional info is on the wrapper and the darn things have 680 calories per bar!! Oh, well.

review/summary: Good taste, but for diet purposes I'd look elsewhere
review/text: I love Pop Tarts. There's tons of different ways to eat them. Unfortunately they aren't the lowest calorie food item out there, so I decided to pick up the low fat variety & try them. After eating them, I was slightly disappointed after doing some fact checking.<br /><br />Taste-wise, these things are awesome & taste very similar to the regular product. Calorie-wise, there isn't a humongous amount of difference. With the regular pop tarts, there was only a difference of 12 calories. The fat content *is* halved in this set, but the sodium, sugar & carbohydrate levels are substantially higher in this than in the regular version.<br /><br />Bluntly put, you'd be better off diet-wise to go with the normal poptarts than to go for this option. If all you are worried about is the fat content, you are set. If you are looking at a variety of factors, you'd be better off going for the regular version. I'm giving this product 3 stars for the taste, but I took 2 away because of the other factors.

Because of that, I think it's getting stuck in my cat's teeth whenever he tries to eat it because he's always using his paw to try to get the food out of his teeth.  He won't eat this anymore at all - he figures out what it is and that's it.  It's a great idea, but it seems to fray and get stuck in his teeth.  He gets a little aggravated over it so I took all of them back to the store.

review/text: I make this very often since the large box lasts me a few days. Personally I prepare it with turkey sausage and make some Jiffy corn muffins on the side. The unaltered taste is good, though I overpower it with a ton of cayenne pepper (I'm obsessed).<br /><br />The bad: Sodium per serving is 50% DV!!! That's rough. Especially when all I can taste is my cayenne pepper haha. There's a reduced sodium version of the normal size boxes, but not these family sized as far as I know. On the plus side, I am pretty sure I get my fill from a single serving, so the serving size is pretty accurate. Definitely not something to eat on its own and stuff yourself with.

review/summary: Nut Milk Bag Review
review/text: I purchased this as a way to save money and make juice at home while buying gift cards to save up and get the Breville Juice Fountain Elite.  I thought perhaps I could slice up and blend fresh fruits and vegetables with a little water added, and strain the pulp out through this rather expensive bag (a paint straining bag would have done the same thing, been much cheaper, and wouldn't have cost anything to ship down at my local Home Depot or Lowes...).  When squeezed, the juice yield is quite low.  I was disappointed in this new thing I decided to try, but it is not the fault of the seller.  The seller provided a fast and smooth transaction, and it was advertised as a "Nut Milk" bag, so maybe the pulp of fruits and vegetables were too much for it to handle.

review/summary: Nothing NEW & IMPROVED about it
review/text: I recently purchased a nut milk bag for $11.95.  It was advertsed as "NEW & IMPROVED".  Now I'm a seamstress and what I received was about &lt;$1.00 in materials and didn't look like much of anything, I might add.  Don't know how you can justify charging $12 for the thing.  Furthermore,  I couldn't figure out what was new and improved about it--it wasn't even tapered at the bottom or have a friction clasp on it.  I would have seamed the sides and not the bottom where the milk comes out. Just found a slightly larger one online for $7.75.  That's like a 120% markup.  Granted it's only a $12 item + shipping and I'm sure it works fine, but I can go to Home Depot and get paint strainig bags for a lot less that work just as well.

review/summary: I like this Nut Milk Bag (purchased from Amazon.com)
review/text: This is my first nut milk bag and it works well for me. I usually use a cheese cloth for straining my Almond milk and it was a little more work. I had to be careful the cheese cloth did not slip and create a mess. When I make almond milk, I use a large strainer first, then I use the milk bag to get a smooth, silky almond milk. If you initially pour the almond milk directly from the blender into the milk bag, you would need to squeeze the bag to get your milk. When you squeeze the bag with a large amount of the pulverized almond, the bag could come apart at the seam. If you don't have a strainer, pour small amounts at a time into the milk bag and squeeze to get all the milk. If you are making your own nut milk, it's best to get a large strainer, it's inexpensive. After blending the almond, pour it through the strainer and then through the milk bag. You will get smooth milk with no gritty taste and your nut bag will last longer.

review/summary: I can't believe I ever made soy milk without this bag!
review/text: After using cheesecloth AND a small mesh strainer to make soy milk I can't believe there was something like this out there all along. I went from having to strain the milk 4 times to only once. It cut the time required to make soy milk in half and less dishes required for all of the pouring back and forth. It fits perfectly on the old thermos (the plastic kind for taking water or other cold liquids not the coffee type) that is about 5-6" across and is exactly the same height. If I were using a large bowl to make the milk I would probably get the gallon bag but this one fits perfect on the top of a pitcher or thermos. The clean-up was much easier than cleaning cheesecloth as well. Nothing stuck in the bag like it does in the cheesecloth so I just dropped the mess into a bowl, rinsed the inside of the bag and hung it up on my kitchen towel hook. I would recommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />ps: It would be a great bag for rinsing sprouts as well.

review/summary: Nut Milk Bag vs Paint Strainer Bag
review/text: I bought a couple strainer bags at Home Depot for about 2.50.  I used one bag for maybe 5 times and it was obvious that it was loosing integrity every time I used it.  I don't think I could have got 5 more uses out of it.  It did work fine... though I think that the pulp was starting to stick to the bag a little.  I would NOT recommend buying paint strainer bags.<br /><br />This nut milk bag works great.  I have used it to make almond milk about 20-25 times now.  I can see it easily lasting quite awhile....at least a year.  Though I will update my review as time passes.  It is easy to clean and the mylk goes through well.  I think it is well made.  For the convenience of buying this and having it last a long time and not making one myself, I think this bag is definitely worth the investment.  The only thing I think the maker should change is the drawstring.  It is made out of a slippery type rope and when you tie it, it does not knot tight and stay knotted.  So I have to re knot it many times.  Also, the rope is starting to fray at the ends.  Even so, I am still giving 5 stars for this product.<br /><br />Advise....buy this nut milk bag and not the paint strainer bag

review/text: The strong, fine mesh of these bags allows for a very nice filtered liquid. I use them mainly for nut milks and save the pulp to add to other raw vegetable pulp and dehydrate into dog biscuits. Bags can be used to filter no-pulp citrus juices, or any juice for that matter. If your juicer leaves a tad bit too much sediment in the liquid, put the juice through a nut milk bag.

review/summary: Great nut milk bag - makes making home made nut milks much easier
review/text: I've just purchased another one of these after heavy use for about a year and a half or two of my original one. I use this a couple times per week to make really great almond milk with maca in it (I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00085DXII">Maca Magic-Powder/Jar - 1.1 lbs - Powder</a> - to me it tastes better than the others...)<br /><br />We ordered a couple of other bags in the past, but the weave wasn't tight enough and it allowed too much pulp through. This one has been just right for us, so I really recommend it.<br /><br />For those who may be new to making nut milks, here is my super-yummy nut milk recipe that works great with this nut milk bag:<br /><br />Super Yummy Maca enhanced Almond milk:<br /><br />1. Soak (fully covered by water and inch above the top of the almonds) about 1 cup of almonds overnight (they'll absorb some of the water and puff up a bit...)<br /><br />2. Drain and do a basic rinse of the almonds<br /><br />3. Add to your vitamix (or other high-powered blender) and add fresh water until the blender container is about 3/4 filled.<br /><br />4. Grind it up well till the bits are pretty tiny and no big chunks are seen.<br /><br />5. Strain it out with a nut-milk bag. The way I do this is: have a very large bowl, put the bag in, holding the top up and open, then pour the ground up nut/water mix into the bag. set the bowl below a kitchen cabinet and hang the string of the nut milk bag on the knob of the upper cabinet (so you have the filled bag hanging over the bowl.) Twist the top a few times so that when you squeeze the bag the goop doesn't come out the top into your bowl, then squeeze the milk out of the bag. What will be left is just the almond pulp. Some folks use this for cookies or other baking, or you can feed it to your chickens (if you have some) or toss it - your call.<br /><br />6. Pour the nut milk back into your vitamix/blender and add the following:<br /><br />1 tbsp vanilla<br />1/4 - 1/2 tsp salt (start with less, but don't omit - it won't taste right...)<br />1 heaping scoop of maca powder (do two if you like it, but start with one to see...)<br />sweetener to taste: 6-8 pitted dates, or a couple tbsp's of honey<br /><br />If planning to drink right away put in ice cubes & water till about 1 1/2 inches from top of blender, or just use water if you don't care to have it cold right away.<br /><br />7. blend until dates have no big chunks, or until well blended if not using dates.<br /><br />8. taste test and see if you need more sweetness. If it is sweet but is "missing something" it is the salt - the salt enhances the sweet and makes it richer (always use some salt in sweet dishes...)<br /><br />This will keep about a week in the fridge, but ours is usually gone w/in 4-5 days max.<br /><br />Once you drink this you'll never buy store bought again and you'll love your nut-milk bag!

review/text: I have used cheese cloths before I got this product and this works much better.<br />I also use the bag for cheese making. As a nut milk bag it is very good.

I would recommend this bag to anyone making nut milk or cheese.

The material is thin so you have to be careful with it that it shouldn't tear. the holes are quite small so even though you get a very smooth milk, you have a lot left in the bag that needs to be squeezed out by hand. so don't think you just pour and you're done.<br /><br />We also squeezed a box of lemons and used the bag to sift. we had a lot of pulp left over and it was a very juicy pulp, that means we had to squeeze a lot to get a dry pulp.<br /><br />Also, seems like a lot of the juice runs through the seams of the bag, so some of the juice may not be as smooth.<br /><br />we liked it, but the price was a little too high.
