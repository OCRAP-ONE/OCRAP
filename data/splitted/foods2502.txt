review/summary: This Apple Cider is Awesome
review/text: I have to say I was afraid to try it because of the experience I had with the Grove Square coffee.  But WOW what a difference in product.  This is much better than the Green Mountain Cider and it is sugar free.  The price is right also!

review/summary: No Apples In Sight
review/text: This is Crap. There's no apples in it. This is a waste of money, I bought three boxes, tasted one k-cup, poured  it out and tossed the remaining boxes in the garbage. I didn't even want to give it away to anyone in fears they would never speak to me again. This is no comparison to Naturals apple cider, which I constantly buy and drink every night, well almost every night.

review/summary: Great Instant Sugar Free Cider
review/text: I am surprised by the negative reviews here.  I mean, instant cider (the kind you get in the packets) will never taste like real cider.  This is actually better than the brands of instant cider I have found.  Yes, it is sweet, and the caramel "finish" is a nice addition.  This is the only K-Cup product I have found that is sugar free, which I appreciate.  If you enjoy instant cider, I wouldn't hesitate.

review/text: I was surprised to see this sugar free version of a favorite of mine and was although looking forward to it, I ordered with a bit of skepticism as oftentimes these drinks can be a bit "watered-down" for my liking.<br /><br />I'm pleased to report that this product was exactly as advertised...a great sugar free hot cider beverage with a nice hint of caramel.  While you can certainly taste the caramel in the beverage, one of the joys of this product is when you first bring it up to your face to sip...the aroma of caramel along with spice notes of the cider is really a snapshot of fall.  This is a product that you and your entire family will enjoy guilt-free!

review/summary: Horrible Smell, Inconsistent Quality...
review/text: I picked up a box of these at either Target or the Navy Exchange...can't remember. They are absolutely terrible though. The smell alone is enough to make you want to toss out the entire box, but I figured I'd at least try it. Thankfully they don't taste as retched as they smell, but they're still not good. I made two k-cups on two different days thinking maybe the first was just a bum cup...nope.<br /><br />My husband went to make a cup and he remarked right before putting the cup in the machine that it felt and sounded empty. Well, all he got was water with the slightest tint of brown to it. He tried a second cup...same thing happened. He finally said screw it and put in a k-cup of decaf coffee...came out perfect, so it was the cups that had the issue, not the machine.<br /><br />I absolutely do NOT recommend these. I can't compare the smell to anything, but it's truly disgusting. There has got to be a better cider k-cup out there somewhere. For now I'll just stick to my packets of cider mix that require some hot water. At least they have a pleasant smell, and actually taste like cider!

review/text: I loved these when I ordered and used them last year.  I kept an extra box in a cool, dry place over the summer.  When i went to make a cup tonite, was dissapointed that it simoly tasted like hot water.  Figuring that it might have been just one pad pod, tried FOUR additional pods with the same result.  Checked the box and expiration is next month....but no warning on the mix evaporating in the cups.  What a waste....very dissapointing since i had thought this was a great drink to curb cool weather munchies.

review/text: I had high hopes for this, despite knowing from reviews here that it contained a sugar substitute. I love hot cider, and especially caramel cider. It smelled great brewing but when I went to take a sip -- ick! The artificial sugar makes this intolerable for me. People who routinely use stuff like Sweet n Low will probably love this. Me, I'm just glad I got this in a sampler rather than buying a huge box as I was tempted to do. Grove Square needs to offer an option that uses real sugar because I think they got it right otherwise. Disappointed. Wanted to really like this.

review/summary: Horrible.  The worst k-cup I've had by far.
review/text: I've probably tried 40+ (maybe more than that) k-cup varieties thus far and this is the only one that is just plain horrible.  The powder rarely comes out correctly (and the fact that you are talking about a powered cider should stop you right there), it has a far too-sweet taste, and well, frankly, it just tastes bad.  My wife and I found the Green Mountain naturals Cider cups on clearance locally (we liked them so much we went back and bought like 16-18 boxes), but I have problems with sugar so I thought I would try this.  Bad idea.  It is borderline undrinkable.  It is, however, better cold than hot, but that's not saying much.  Low price, low quality.  Even the physically cup itself isn't made as well as the "real" k-cups.  It is made to fit in a Keurig brewer.  It is not a true k-cup.  Note that the title says "for Keurig K-Cup Brewers".  It is worded that way for a reason.  Avoid like the plague.  If you can handle sugar, check out the Green Mountain version.  If you can't, well, I've not found a better choice either.  In fairness, apparently everything this company makes isn't horrible.  My wife loves their Peppermint Hot chocolate.  Neither one of us can stand this crap however.

review/text: I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, but this product really isn't that bad. There really isn't an after taste and not as intense as I thought it would have been as some of the reviews have made it out to be. The flavor is not amazing, but not bad either. I was expecting a little more zing. All in all, I paid 9.99 for 24 cups and I am not disappointed. Yes the "natural" and "real" product is better (I have tried both), but if I see this product at that good of a price again, I will definitely buy it. 3 out of 5 stars for value and taste (yes it's still enjoyable).

review/summary: Wierd Taste
review/text: I was really looking forward to having some good apple cider out of my Keurig machine. The cider has a wierd taste to it and a very bad aftertaste. After my wife and I both tried a cup, we ended up throwing the rest of it out.

review/summary: Cant use this in a Keurig!!!  WTF!
review/text: This product doesn't fit into a  Keurig K-Cup Brewer.  You just use a knife to puncture the lid, dump it into a cup, and fill it with hot water.  Could use a Keurig to fill it, I suppose.  Wasted 3 until I realized this.  I gave it 1 star because it tasted OK.  Use the Keurig name to charge extra.  Not acceptable.

review/summary: ASPARTAME!!!
review/text: I'm allergic to aspartame and have bad kidney problems after drinking it unknowingly.  I ordered this product and would not have if it had said SUGAR FREE.  I would've had a clue that I couldn't drink it.  Ingredient labeling should be mandatory.  It certainly wasn't advertised correctly and completely wasted my money.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I was very hesitant to order this product because of the negative reviews. I'm so glad that I went ahead and ordered because it is so tasty. It's warming and relaxing on a chilly fall day. I don't ever drink anything that is sweetened with sugar and I am used to the flavor of aspartame so I found no odd flavors in this at all. I also bought the natural apple cider ones made by Green Mountain Coffee from my local BB&B because they are so expensive on Amazon. I found that I actually don't like those as much as the Grove Square. They are very acidic and don't contain any of the delicious seasonings. If I doctor up the plain apple cider with a shot or 2 of Torani sugar-free brown sugar and cinnamon flavoring then the Green Mountain version almost tastes as good as these Grove Square cider cups. If you regularly use artificial sweeteners in your beverages then I don't think you will be at all disappointed in the flavor of the Grove Square Spiced Apple Cider Cups.<br /><br />As a side note, I always clean out my used K-cups in order to put them in my recycling. Because they contain an instant powder, there is nothing left behind in the Grove Square cups. The Green Mountain apple cider cups contain a really gross mush of nasty reconstituted apple. It's a little off putting.

review/summary: Horrible, spend a lil more and get green mountain
review/text: I was very excited to find a cheaper cider. However, it is most likely worth the expense to get green mountain brand. Unfortunately I did not realize that the product was artifically sweetened. When it came I saw on the box that it was and tried it anyway. Luckily one of my roommates enjoyed it so was not a total lose.

The apple taste is pure, the caramel is spot on and the ease of use is outstanding.  Thanks Amazon & Grove Square.  I have this on subscription order for every 2 months.  This will be good for my emergency preparedness "stash" also.  Wow!

review/text: All of the other reviewers seem to be in uproar.  I understand the statements knocking the "caramel" flavor, it is admittedly not very appealing.  The Cider flavor on the other hand is wonderful.  In fact, I would go to say that the Cider K-Cup is my favorite K-Cup product.  My family uses our machines daily (sometimes hourly) and when we have it, the Cider pack is one of everyone's favorites.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that it's taking 3-5 weeks to ship at the moment!

review/text: I am not sure why all the negativity about this product. I think it tasts pretty good....even my husband thought it was good; better than the spiced cider and he is pretty picky. a good drink for a cool, fall evening or winter day. We have our own well and only use well water or botten water which has no chlorine in it....I think if you are on city water and using city water it would definitely alter the taste. My daughter and son-in-law, and my colleague also enjoy it. I tried my colleagues and am ordering my own.

review/text: This product works fine in my Keurig coffee maker... I just do not personally care for the flavor.  It is VERY sweet - - tastes pretty much like most instant cider mixes. For me, making it weaker improves the taste.  Again, the product works fine; my 2-star rating is based mostly on my personal dislike of the flavor.

review/summary: Take the bad reviews seriously....
review/text: I am addicted to caramel apple cider - and being only 10 calories and fairly inexpensive, I wanted so much to like this product. I thought even if it wasn't the best cider I'd ever had, it would at least be a good enough substitute for when I was watching my weight and couldn't afford to go to Starbucks. I was so wrong - what a waste of money! First off, it smelled so bad that it made me nauseous. I brought it to class with me, and was worried the whole time that everyone around me could smell it. Then, the taste was unbearable. I took a sip, gagged, tried adding some fat-free whipped cream, sugar-free caramel syrup, and cinnamon - still disgusting, the awful cider taste overpowered anything I put in. Needless to say, I wasted $10, will be throwing out all the k-cups, and will have to look for my cider fix elsewhere. Take the bad reviews seriously - I wish I had!

review/summary: Best SF hot drink EVER!
review/text: I was a bit leery when I ordered this product but it is fabulous!  No aftertaste at all and if you set it on a smaller cup, it is just the right strength--not too weak at all.  I do doctor it a bit though.  Before I brew, I put about 6 cinnamon red hots in the cup, along with a cinnamon stick.  Then when done, I add a light sprinkle of my own mix of cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Almost as wonderful as my freshly simmered REAL apple cider!  The "caramel" part of this drink is what really makes it yummy!  Perfect for that cool autumn night, or anytime.  Highly recommend this drink!  And the price is wonderful too.

review/summary: Very Bad Taste
review/text: This product is made with aspartamane, but that doesn't bother me. I only drink diet sodas instead of regular ones whenever I have the occassional soda (try to limit it to 1-2 a week) so the taste doesn't bother me, I also use Stevia and Spenda at home so I'm accustomed the the different sugar-free flavors.<br />I had such high hopes for this drink. I was looking forward to having a cup of hot cider at work. Granted I didn't think it would taste like real cider but I'd been looking forward to a hot apple-y drink.<br />When my shipment came in I brought it to work and had my first cup. Immediately I could smell it. It smelled really good at first. If you put your nose too close you can smell kinda a sickly-sweet scent. I tried it and nearly spat. It tasted extremely chemically and entirely overwhelming. The "caramel" was caramel only insofar as what a machine can reproduce. It was not caramel as I was expecting, not even slightly.<br />I tried letting it cool and drinking it cold. It was perhaps a teensy bit more palatable.<br />I tried watering it down. That helped. The Keurig at work only goes to 12 ounces. So perhaps ones that go to 16 ounces might diffuse the flavor a little more. This is why I gave it a 2 star instead of just 1.<br /><br />Now these things just sit forgotten in a drawer. Maybe I can figure out something to do with them...

OFfers a variety to the keurig k cup line up besides the usual teas, coffee cocoa etc Hot cider is a fave  of mine so I decided to try the carmael apple first I do plan on coming back to buy more of these and to try the spiced cider variety of these too.

The flavor and consistency of this soup is wonderful. (I add a little bit of diced ham to it). I had my sister bring a few cans with her on a visit but was reconciled to the fact that, like tri-tip, there are a few things that I can't get here in Wisconsin.  Imagine my delight and surprise when a search for Pea Soup Andersens brought a link to amazon.com. I have ordered a dozen cans every year since and enjoy having a little bit of Santa Barbara here.

review/text: Catnip needs to be carefully cultivated (I read) so that other plants do not creep into the field.  Also, it must be fresh to really get the cat to respond.  My beloved cat did not react as I expected; truly effective catnip has a narcotic effect on susceptible cats, putting them in a spell almost.  My cat could take or leave this catnip unless it was really laid on heavily.

review/summary: Perfect Vanilla Extract
review/text: I have been using Simply Organic's Vanilla Extract for several years now.  I find it to be perfect for my needs.  This is about 2/3 the price that I pay for the vanilla locally.<br /><br />I suppose that I could go into the aroma and all that good stuff; however, I'm going for boring in this review.<br /><br />The only thing that would make this better is if Amazon offered this extract up on their Subscribe and Save service.

review/summary: Simply Organic Vanilla Extract - Yummy!!
review/text: This product is delicious!!  I priced a similar product at Food Lion today, and this product, even with shipping costs, is a better buy.  Plus it's organic.  I plan to buy two bottles at a time, at least.  I use it to add oomph to coffee, oatmeal - anything that I want to have taste special, without adding sugar.  Start with just a few drops and add more as needed.  Go ahead and get some, treat yourself.  You deserve it!

review/text: We try to purchase organic when we can.  I had never seen organic vanilla extract until I viewed an ad in an herb magazine recently.  On researching Amazon I found Simply Organic Pure Vanilla at a decent price and decided to order.  I love it.  Taste is quite different than the common McCormick's brand imitation vanilla one finds in stores.  I'll definitely be ordering this again!

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I used to use another brand of vanilla, which I liked, but they've switched from glass bottles to plastic, and we try not to let our food touch plastic.<br /><br />SO, I've started using Simply Organic Vanilla Extract.  I really like it because:<br />- The ingredients are so pure.  There really does not need to be sugar or corn syrup in vanilla extract.<br />- The aroma is wonderful, and it makes baked goods taste fantastic.<br />- It comes in glass bottles, which is reassuring, because foods that come in plastic containers tend to absorb chemicals from the plastic.  Glass is safe, though.  This also maintains the intended flavor.<br />- It is organic, so I trust that these folks followed a rigid set of standards that ensure the purity and quality of the extract.<br /><br />I'm totally satisfied with this product, and I will continue to buy it.

review/summary: Finally, a pure vanilla extract.
review/text: After purchasing several different "pure" extracts which (even the expensive ones) were heavily laden with sugar and corn syrup - to my surprise, at least at first - I found this simple, organic and pure extract. I love it, and have since purchased other flavors. I never thought I'd go through both bottles in a year but was back for more in less than a year.

review/text: I've bought this product a few times from my local grocery store and I like it very much. I love the fact that it's organic and has a very good vanilla flavor. I would rather pay a little bit more money for this organic vanilla extract because it is a real product and doesn't contain any artificial ingredients. So-called vanilla extract just doesn't compare to this brand in my honest opinion. I would recommend this product for sure.

review/text: I have written MANY reviews of Amazon products. Most of them have been either 4 or 5 stars ... occasionally a 3. THIS IS MY FIRST "ONE STAR". I would have given it a zero if I could have. This stuff is JUNK.<br /><br />Perhaps the other reviewers are correct ... and I just got a bad pair of bottles. But the ones I got were so diluted as to be nearly useless.<br /><br />I plan to throw these in the trash as soon as my order of a better brand arrives from Amazon.<br /><br />The ONLY plus I would give this outfit is that they are prompt in their delivery, but perhaps over zealous in the bubble wrap and tape department.<br /><br />Fred Moore, Herndon, VA

review/text: I have been impressed with all the Van Houtte products I have purchased here on Amazon.<br />I keep a journal of all the new coffee's I have brewed and which cup size etc. (I have the B40 Machine)<br /><br />I like my coffee with cream & a sugar substitute and the Hazelnut tastes great on either cup setting. Little after taste and mild acidity; which, doesn't linger; I dislike a coffee which does that.<br /><br />Smooth and rich but never overpowering. Just the right blend off coffee and flavoring. This coffee too will win a place on m top 5 list which may grow to a top 10 list at this rate.

review/summary: Not vanilla.
review/text: As far as vanilla hazelnut coffee goes, these are woefully deficient in vanilla.  You could even say that they're completely devoid of vanilla.  How the word "vanilla" made it into the title or description of this item is a mystery, because the word is nowhere to be found on the actual item.<br /><br />They're good, mind you.  But this review is all about the expectations gap.  I honestly wouldn't have bothered if they were just described as "hazelnut."  If they were absolutely incredible, sure -- maybe they'd be worth it at over $1 per cup.  But all things considered, I can get about five times the coffee for the same price, and this isn't quite rising to the level of must-have-it-at-any-price.
