review/summary: BETTER than the other MORE EXPENSIVE manuka
review/text: I purchased this brand after trying several others, including the most popular brand on Amazon.  I must say that this brand (Manuka Health) has been the best one yet.  It is better than the most popular Wedderspoon brand and better than the more expensive Watson and Sons. So, if you're looking for quality then this is the one for you.  UMF/MGO rated and does not disappoint.  Definitely will purchase again.

review/summary: Works for my stomach issues
review/text: This is pretty pricey so I use it as a "last resort" when I am having digestion/stomach issues. It works great for that, but is so expensive that I try other things first.  The price is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

review/text: I've read wonderful things about the benefits of this honey. Hopefully it's not a fad, health tip gone viral. We enjoy the taste. Very sweet and bold. You don't need much to go a long way. The price is decent, granted this type of honey is more expensive than most...but after doing some searching this price was fairly competitive compared to grocery store. We've re-order this because we were happy with it. We use it in our vegan protein shakes. Tasty :)

review/text: I'm on my second order of tea (having already gone through 12 boxes) and I've come to really enjoy this tea. It's light enough that I can drink two cups everyday and the flavor never gets old.<br /><br />The brown rice is the real winner here. It compliments the green tea perfectly. This tea seems to have a settling effect on my stomach and has enough caffeine to give you a little boost without giving me a headache (which I almost always get from drinking coffee).

review/text: Eden Foods Inc. is the oldest independent organic food producer in the United States, having been formed in 1968 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. One of their product lines is a range of interesting and delicious teas. A really interesting tea is their traditional genmaicha - a Japanese tea made with green tea and roasted brown rice. It has a mild flavor that includes the green tea (it can get lost if there are too many other favors) but also a sort of earthy, smokiness.<br /><br />Want a great drink experience? Drink it with sugar and a thin slice of orange!<br /><br />This is a delicious tea, from an excellent company. If you are into organic, and want a great tea, then get this wonderful genmaicha.<br /><br />(Review of Eden Organic Green Tea with Brown Rice, Traditional Genmaicha)

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: My wife liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X0RV7O">Yamamotoyama Genmai-cha Green Tea with Roasted Brown Rice, 1.69-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> green tea with roasted brown rice & asked me to order more.  While I was shopping, I found the same type of tea from Eden.  The Eden tea appealed to me because it was organic, got great reviews, and was more expensive than the Yamamotoyama brand, so I assumed it was better quality.  When I got the tea, I made a cup of each at the same time to compare.  I was surprised to see that the less expensive Yamamotoyama was a little darker, and the roasted brown rice flavor was stronger.  I realize the roasted brown rice green tea is considered inferior, but if you like that taste, I think more of it is better.  I think the reason for the difference is that, the Yamamotoyama had about twice as much tea in the bag as the Eden.  I'll try to post some pictures.

review/summary: Great Genmaicha but not the best
review/text: This is a great tea, no doubt about it. However, the rice flavor overpowers that of the green tea. Actually, I don't know if you can really taste green tea at all. If you want a more balanced organic Genmaicha then I would highly recommend Two Leaves & a Bud <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046V2V06">Organic Gen Mai Cha Tea</a>. It's more expensive but it's much more balanced and you can taste both green tea and toasted rice. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed!

review/text: If you want to make sure that everything in your office is humming smoothly, make sure you pick up these chocolate bars for Valentine's day.  Every secretary absolutely loved the chocolate itself.  It's very rich, and the freeze-dried raspberries were far superior to the usual raspberry cream or artificial flavorings. As an added bonus, each wrapper has a poem in it, making the gift that much more thoughtful.  If you have 8 women in your life who like chocolate, or one woman who LOVES chocolate, this is a fantastic purchase.<br /><br />I even kept 2 bars to use for chocolate mousse, which I can't say enough good things about.

They're all good, but none surpass chocolove in taste.

review/summary: Good chocolate, and fruit lends crispy twist
review/text: I bought a single of these bars as part of an Xmas gift, and this one was one of the best.  The freeze dried raspberries are definitely different from other fruit in chocolate I've had: they are actually a little crispy, which was a surprisingly nice touch.  The chocolate was good, and the packaging is attractive.  The love poem is a little lame, but in general, I'd buy this again.  In fact, I'm considering it right now.

review/summary: Decadent dark chocolate; a healthy treat and attractive gift
review/text: The news just keeps getting better and better for dark chocolate!<br /><br />Dark chocolate contains flavanol, the phytochemicals that boost the function of vital endothelial cells, which line up inside the blood vessels, thus slashing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Eating dark chocolate also releases dopamine, a feel-good hormone.<br /><br />Now, we've learned that dark chocolate helps you lose weight!<br /><br />A study released this month by the University of Copenhagen suggests that eating a little dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate may banish cravings for sweet, salty and fatty foods and thus make you lose weight.<br /><br />Health benefits aside, we purchased these dark chocolate bars from Chocolove as a Christmas gift. We send a holiday care package to our friends living overseas each year. Each package includes an assortment of gifts and treats, which we try to buy from local companies here in the Northwest (Chocolove is produced in Boulder, Colorado).<br /><br />The Amazon order includes a box of 12 bars, each containing freeze-dried raspberry pieces enveloped in Belgian dark chocolate crafted from African cocoa beans. Of course, we tested one bar before sending off the rest as Christmas gifts.<br /><br />These chocolate bars are decadent and nicely accompany a cup of hot tea.<br /><br />In summary, these chocolates are delicious, reasonably priced and the attractive package design (each bar includes a love poem!) makes this a perfect gift for Christmas, Valentine's Day or any occasion when you want to share your love.<br /><br />BTW: In addition to this box of dark chocolate bars, we also purchased and recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPYFQ">McSteven's Olde English Toffee</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPY7Y">McSteven's Jolly Blend Cocoa</a> as Christmas gifts.<br /><br />Last year, we bought truffle collections from Seattle Chocolates to send overseas. Each order -- Blackberry Cr&egrave;me Truffles, White Chocolate Orange Truffles and Pink Polka Dot Assorted Truffles - included three boxes of individually wrapped truffles. These chocolates are no longer available on Amazon but keep an eye out should they return.

I actually added fresh hot chiles because I like it hot!<br /><br />As it is, this is a great base!  I added some chicken breast and a bit of chicken stock, fresh mushrooms, fresh cilantro, some fresh chopped red serranos, squirt of lime juice and some bean sprouts and you've got a meal!  If you're camping or in a rush, the soup alone from the can is wonderful as well.<br /><br />Let me repeat that....what comes in the can is perfectly WONDERFUL and you don't need to add anything if you don't want too.<br /><br />SOOO happy this is available!!

It is a very good blend, and I really enjoy the spice and flavor.  The soup does have an initial bite because of the spice, but if you are a spicy food fan, it is not overwhelming at all.<br /><br />We use the soup either straight out of the can or as a base for a larger, more ingredient-filled soup.  Either way, this is a yummy soup that I will buy over & over again.<br /><br />NOTE: Picture on can is misleading.  The soup is more "brothy" than chunky.

review/text: Bought a case of this soup & am sooo happy I did! It's just THE perfect thing to have when I get one of my "just have to have it" Thai food cravings which, invariably, occur when our local Thai restaurant is closed! No problem with this can on-hand to the rescue! It's perfect as it is just from the can & not too spicy at all! I eat everything in the can & I love that the lemon grass & Thai ginger pieces, galangal, are tender enough to eat! Makes a perfectly tasty & quick meal for two when I add a little bit of shredded chicken breast, some corn, can of Asian straw mushrooms & a cup or two of Thai Jasmine rice! Very filling & just hits the spot & satisfies that craving! Can't beat the price of less than $3.00 a can! Going to definitely order another case for this coming winter season! Nothing like a steaming hot pot of delicious Thai goodness on a chilly winter's evening but it's also good anytime of the day & I admit I've even made this for breakfast! Highly recommend, if you love Thai soup as much as I do & your Thai restaurant is closed! Great by itself but also makes for a wonderful soup base to creatively add whatever protein or veggie you want!

review/text: I like the flavor of this mild Thia Coconut ginger soup by Thai Kitchen and it is gluten-free.  You can easily add spice and lime leaf and lemongrass if you want to make a spicer Thom Yum  or Thom Kai or you can leave it mild.  My local WF says MSRP is $2.69 and that's what they sell it for so i don't know why the MSRP is shown higher on Amazon but you end up pretty much paying about full price without a discount for bulk purchase.  It is a nice soup base to add other veggies too as well and satisifies that I-gotta-have-Thai hankering.

In terms of "net carbs" this means while the nutritional information on the Amazon website suggests a serving has 11 grams net carbs, in fact a serving has 18 grams net carbs, an increase of more than 60 percent over what the website indicates.<br /><br />I haven't tasted the stuff nor will I so my rating is not based on the taste of the product.

I diluted it down with regular coconut milk, chunks of chicken breast, julienne carrots, and finally added some instant mashed potato flakes to thicken it up, and eventually was able to enjoy more than a couple of spoonfuls of it at one time. It is definitely worthwhile, but also has way too much of the inedible chunks of ginger and lemongrass. Try it at your own peril!

review/summary: The best cuban coffee out there...
review/text: In my attempt to duplicate the Cafe Cubano's my wife and I have in Miami, I bought this product after much research.<br /><br />Cannot get this where I live (Colorado) so had to order online.  This is the supreme standard of Cuban-style coffee beans.  Beans came in perfect condition and vacuum packed in the bag displayed.<br /><br />I have not tried Pilon, but these two brands come from the same company in Miami.  Pilon from what I gather is the more standard version, while the Bustelo Supreme is the higher line.<br /><br />Trick - be sure grind these very very fine, and add (lots of) sugar in the carafe where the espresso will pour into from the machine, this allows the sugar to carmelize and it tastes more authentic.

review/summary: Best Coffee Around
review/text: This is the best coffee we've found commercially available.  The whole bean product gives us a fresh cup of coffee every morning.  The flavor is smooth, but strong.  There's no comparison to the yellow can Bustelo (as seen on two and a half men).  We buy four pounds at a time and, with Amazon's shipping, it's really a bargain.  There's no better coffee around.

review/summary: Where are all the high fructose monkeys?
review/text: Cause this stuff has it, Lea & Perrins doesn't!<br /><br />But thats not why I'm rating this so low. It gets two stars because its terrible,<br />a thin watery pitiful substitute for L&P that does no justice to any dish, and<br />especially not to a Bloody Mary.<br /><br />Heinz is a pretty good brand name, I have never understood why they cant get this<br />right. Check it yourself, pull a bottle from the shelf, turn it upside down and see<br />how quickly it runs down the sides leaving nothing behind. I suppose if you cooked<br />this down to about a 60% solution it would be ready to use, but right out of the<br />bottle its a pretty weak substitute for real Worcestershire sauce. I did have a<br />bottle of this that I fortified with a Tsp of anchovy paste and it tasted much better.

review/text: I'm a big fan of chamomile tea, partially because it's one of those teas where you don't have to worry about letting the tea bag steep overly long. (Tea drinkers will know what I'm talking about.)<br /><br />This has a nice mellow flavor and brews up quickly. It's the typical chamomile flavor, and while it's very, very hard to mess up a chamomile tea, this is pretty nice. It's incredibly soothing- so much so that I had to fight the sleepy feeling that drifted over me. (So if you're having trouble sleeping, this will be perfect!)<br /><br />I'll absolutely drink this brand again.

review/text: I bought a can of this in a retail store. My coworker loved it so much she took it from me so I bought another can. I served it to several friends and they all love it. It's an "earthier" tasting tea so it might not jive with many people. It's got subtle undertones and a deep rich flavor. Adding some sugar makes it even tastier. It's a great substitute for a hot cocoa on a cold night. If you're the kind of tea drinker who expects artificial, corn-syrup laden Snapple flavors in your tea, then don't bother with this one.

review/summary: A great alternative to dessert - simply delicious!
review/text: Well, I don't quite know what the other reviewers are talking about... I've tried this tea and found it absolutely delicious. When I first opened it, I did get a strong rooibos smell, as this is the tea base. However, once brewed, the smell changes to a sweet, tangy smell with chocolate undertones. simply wonderful.<br /><br />It's true that it doesn't taste exactly like red velvet. I mean, come on, you're talking about tea... not a true cupcake with frosting. However, I add a splash of vanilla coffeemate and it tastes very close to me. I get the chocolate undertone and the flavor is sweet and amazing, with a bit of a tange, not unlike true red velvet. It's a perfect after dinner treat! Plus, the bright red hue they have managed to develop really makes you feel like you're drinking liquid red velvet (thanks to all natural beet extract!).<br /><br />I only gave this a 4/5 because without the coffeemate, it isn't quite sweet enough for me, and I think the creaminess helps to bring out the chocolate undertones.<br /><br />Overall, I plan on buying this over and over again in the future!

I have tested my amazon prime benefits for the first time on this item and quite frankly, it was way faster than the Super Saver shipping speed! No minimums were required, but a $25 minimum was required for the Super Saver shipping promotion. Get amazon prime today and save big on what you really like! Don't get this elsewhere.

review/summary: A ginger lover's treat!
review/text: Friends of ours (former Vermonters) introduced us to this product a couple of years ago and we have loved this refreshing "mint" ever since.  Actually, there is no peppermint in it at all, just the crisp taste of ginger, mixed with organic Vermont maple syrup, organic tapioca syrup, and organic crystallized cane juice.  I have to dole this out to my daughter in small increments or she would eat half a tin in half a minute.  She can't stop!  It's great after a meal as it helps with the digestion though it is good just about any time.  Once we had run out of the GingerMints and bought some other brand.  There was no comparison.  We're glad that we could get this 6-pack.  We bought two.  All this talk of GingerMints has made me want to pop a few in my mouth.  Mmmm...

review/text: The ginger flavor is a bit too subtle for me and it's overwhelmed by sweetness. I think most people would like this balance, but I'm looking for more of a "bite" in my ginger candy. The texture is a little unusual - one reviewer described it like those valentine candy hearts, and I'd say that's pretty accurate. They dissolve a little too quickly in my opinion. I probably wouldn't buy these again.

review/summary: Like valentine candy hearts
review/text: PROS: cute packaging (albeit somewhat annoying) and true ginger taste.<br />CONS: texture, high price tag, and uppity self-righteousness<br /><br />My brother and I tried them on a whimsy and both quickly came to the conclusion that we wouldn't buy them again.  Their ginger kick is fine and subtle but the texture seriously reminded me of chalky valentine candy hearts (you know, the ones that people can't seem to get rid of fast enough). The inside of the tin was also full of blatant feel-goodness. I hate that kind of talk on organic/all-natural products. If you have a good product that's also good for the environment, it should speak for itself.<br /><br />p.s. altoids are pretty gluten-free too and nut-free too (though they may be processed in a plant that also processes other products).

review/summary: Great Coffee Obscene Pricing
review/text: 5 Stars for the coffee and 1/2 Star for the price - CAN YOU SAY RIPOFF?<br /><br />We love the blond roast Veranda Blend from Starbucks.  That is surprising since I've never been a big fan of Starbucks coffee.  However this blend hits it out of the park.  It has a rich, pungent and unique flavor that is exotic and potent.  In fact we are hooked on this blend to the exclusion of other coffees.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I will NOT be a buyer here until Amazon or their marketplace sellers get realistic with their pricing.  They are taking the Costco package (40oz) and reselling it at a 50% mark up!  NO Thanks, I will continue to buy this great coffee at Costco for $19.95/40oz bag.  Get real Amazon this is a ripoff.  Very un-Amazon.  In fact, this package equates to buying the retail 1 lb bag at $12/lb which I can get anytime at my local Von's/Safeway.  Too bad.  I would love to sign up for a subscribe and save on this item if it were priced realistically.<br /><br />Disregard the 1 star review posted here.  This reviewer must have ground the beans incorrectly or brewed the coffee incorrectly which is obvious by the content of their review.  I have never had a problem with either the brewing or flavor of this awesome coffee.<br /><br />Update: Costco stores are discontinuing this item so they have reduced the price, I just bought 10 bags (yep 25 pounds) at $14.95/bag = $5.98/lb!

The taste is a bit bland, but the main problem is that it plugs up paper filters causing an overflow on the counter every day . . . or when you think its done, you remove the coffee pot and the basket valve dumps a cup of coffee all over the place because it is jamned up with grounds that ran over the top of the paper filter.<br /><br />This issue is the coffee, not the coffee maker, but maybe some coffee makers that feed the hot water in more slowly would not have this problem.<br /><br />So, we tried mixing this stuff 1/2 and 1/2 with Starbucks French Roast just to get rid of it, but it still plugs the paper filters mixed with the French Roast.<br /><br />There may be variables with differennt filters and coffee makers, but we cannot be the only one with this big mess every day.

review/text: OK, so this soup is full of fat and sodium, but it's still the best tasting cream of chicken soup anywhere! If fat and sodium is a problem, then just drink less of it. The best tasting cream of chicken is when you add 1/2 full milk and 1/2 water, but that might be a bit too much, so you can use 2% milk instead. The way I make it is to put the soup in the pan and slowly add the milk and water. If you add water/milk right away to the soup you'll get lumpy soup. And there are tons of recipes on the internet, it's just the best tasting soup ever!

review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.

review/text: I used these for the first time this summer hiking the Grand Canyon and other places out west, we took down bottled sport drink and these tablets to save weight. At home I tried them and thought they taste like watered down grape jello, but not bad. On the trip I was amazed, sports drinks got hot and tasted gross and sticky, made you feel bloated yet still thirsty. These little tabs cover the taste of water, didn't make your mouth feel gross and you could feel the pick up it gave you. Completely satisfied with the product and willing to try other flavors. It was easy to use, pop them in your bottle and they fizz away, a quick shake and your ready to go. Don't pop them in your mouth, as a buddy of mine did thinking thats how you used them, he gagged his way through for quite a while, I still laugh at the memory.

review/summary: Relief from the Texas sun
review/text: These are great. As a Central Texas deck builder, I'm in the sun all day long. After years of struggling with hydration, I've finally found a solution. I freeze 2, 1 liter bottles and 1 gallon bottle every nite. I add 1 tab to each bottle and I haven't had a single problem hydrating this summer, no cramping at all. THANKS

review/summary: Make Gluten-Free Sticky Rolls.
review/text: I had been using the 'original' Chebe mix. Then from the Chebe website www.Chebe.com, I saw a recipe for sticky rolls using the Cinnamon version of this item. Wow....they got rave reviews from even the folks that didn't need to eat Gluten-free. GOOD STUFF! Easy to make. Certainly an item that will be used again and again at our house. You can use this mix to make several things, so it is a multipurpose mix. Again you can check out www.chebe.com to find ways to use it.

review/summary: If I can do this, anyone can!
review/text: I'm not a very good baker, but I have been sooo craving cinnamon rolls.  I was worried when I read some of the reviews, but I didn't add anything special and they turned out fine.  Well, except for two things: #1, because the mix makes 11 rolls, I put water in the empty muffin holder.  That may have helped them to be so moist and almost slightly fluffy.  And #2, anything tastes good with a cream cheese glaze/frosting so I mixed together 4oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tsps milk, and 1/2 tsp vanilla and generously frosted the rolls while they were still warm.  I had plenty of frosting left over, so I put it in a baggie and will use it for the next time I make rolls.  I'll just cut a corner of the baggie and squirt the frosting out.  Oh, wait, there's one more thing I did differently.  Before I rolled out the dough, I was going to flour the board (with gluten free flour) but decided instead to lightly sugar it instead.  I dusted the rolling pin now and then with it, and the dough didn't stick to anything.  I've eaten quite a few now and they were delicious straight out of the oven piping hot, slightly warm later on, and cold hours later. They were pretty easy to make, and I am so full now. (A note: my son is not gluten sensitive he's just allergic to wheat so I don't know if the frosting I made is gluten free or not. You'd have to check that out yourself.)

review/summary: Not as expected
review/text: I've been gluten-free for five years. My husband and I have tried many different bread products. I was very excited to try the cinnamon rolls because I have been craving pastries. I bought the Chebe breadsticks and love them so I thought this was a guaranteed winner too. My husband made a pack for me today. I wasn't too impressed. The texture was more stiff and it had an off taste. I guess I was expecting a "regular" cinnamon roll! :(<br />I've found through the years that you can get used to anything if you want to so I'm sure I will like the cinnamon rolls after a few attempts. I will definitely be sticking with the breadsticks though!

review/summary: Tricks to Make it Better
review/text: I've done the several batches of this mix. Before anyone claims they hate it, try these simple tricks.<br /><br />1. Add 1 tsp of baking powder -> adds fluff (1 tsp for every cup of flour)<br /><br />2. If allergic to eggs -> use Ener-G egg replacement. Follow the directions. Add 1 tsp of olive oil (help with the texture since the egg fat isn't present)<br /><br />3. DO NOT OVER MIX! GO slow if you have to. Watch a video on knowing when the dough is elastic so you know when to stop. (One of the flours in this batch gets hard from over mixing - will update when I remember which one)<br /><br />4. Keep the 3 tbsp of oil (I used olive oil) Chebe calls for. If you replace with applesauce, it will add as a binder. Trust me, you do NOT want two binders in a recipe.<br /><br />5. Take your time rolling the dough to make it nice and tight. This keeps the Cinnamon mix in the middle.<br /><br />6. To heat up the rolls again, DO NOT USE THE MICROWAVE! Use a toaster oven or a nonstick pan with a cover. I personally use the pan and steam heat the rolls again.<br /><br />These tricks may not work for all. I will update when I learn more and feel free to post your own tricks.

review/summary: Delicious! But you do need to add eggs, oil, sugar, and cinnamon
review/text: When I first made these, I was resentful that I had to add so many of my own ingredients, but I had been searching for a decent gluten-free cinnamon roll for such a long time. Well....the results were worth it. I love 'em!  Instead of baking them in a greased muffin tin, I used cupcake liners and that worked out great. I also added walnuts. And I didn't bother to use a rolling pin. I flattened out the dough inside the mixing bowl, added the fillings, rolled it up and sliced it. The texture is pleasantly chewy. We ate them over a three-day period and, kept in a plastic baggie, they never  dried out. They were just as delicious on day three as on the day they were made. I would imagine that these could easily be turned into a more decadent treat by making four large rolls instead of twelve tiny ones and adding your own vanilla frosting.

review/summary: Not for us- at least not yet
review/text: I notice one reviewer added yeast to the mix- that might make these better.  The taste isn't too bad (I added currants to the filling) but the consistency is nothing like a cinnamon roll.  The way mine turned out they are kind of like bread which hasn't risen properly.  Kind of heavy- and more like crust (doughy crust rather than crunchy) than bread.  i only bought two boxes at my local whole foods- because I've been burned before by things that were supposed to taste like my favorite foods, and then didn't.  I'm going to try adding yeast to my other box of mix- and see if that makes it any better.  Right now I'm disappointed, though.

These are great as snacks and to satisfy a sweet tooth without being overly sweet.<br /><br />To make the monkey bread I follow the instructions on the package then roll small balls of dough and place in a baking dish.  I cover the dough balls with a cooked butter/brown sugar and nut mixture and bake.  Super sweet and dense, definitely not an every day snack!<br /><br />This mix is a great starter to make your own recipes, the website also has tons of recipes to try out!

review/text: It took the second time for these to be good. The first time, I ate them as they were coming out of the oven, couldn't resist the aroma. Yes they were too chewy, or gooey almost play-doh like. Still good but I did not like the consistency.<br /><br />However, the second time I did as recommended added baking soda/powder, and they did rise a little bit! Again I couldn't resist the aroma, still play-doh like. However the next morning they were PERFECT! Not play-doh like. So if you can resist wait till the next day. I just left them out on counter.<br /><br />Pretty good, next I will try to add some type of frosting.

review/text: The box to this product boasts not using eggs or milk, but asks you to use them in the ingredients (many gluten-intolerant folks also cant have milk or eggs). I used the never-fail flaxseed egg replacement and put almond milk instead of cow's milk. The dough had a consistency reminiscent of seitan and was tough to roll and very greasy. The rolls cooked, sure, but they didn't change shape at all, were hard on the outside, and chewy on the inside. Really kind of nauseating. Wouldn't recommend this mix.. especially not for vegans.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: Minute Maid quit selling their frozen lemon juice.  Why, I don't know, but then I needed too find a replacement and juicing lemons is too much work for my arthritic fingers.  So I embarked on an internet search for a replacement.  Lakewood Organic is what I came up with.  Of course it costs more and I have to buy a case at a time, but it tastes better and "organic" has to be a plus, right?  Yeah, I don't know either. But the bottom line is Lakewood tastes really good and it's all I can find.  If Minute Maid brings back their frozen lemon juice again, what will I do?  Well, price is more of a factor now, so I honestly don't know.  If their price were the same, then I'd go Lakewood without a second thought.

review/summary: Better than fresh ( well, almost )
review/text: Too often cooking-up something requires fresh lemon juice to give it that certain 'zing'. The stuff from concentrate just doesn't have it. But if the dish calls for lemon juice I would usually find myself heading for the store and paying too much for the lemon or two I needed. Until I found the Lakewood Organic. This stuff is as close to fresh as you can get ( it is pure lemon juice- not from concentrate ) and has that unique clear flavor that real lemons offer.<br /><br />While a little pricey, I still bought a case and keep it refrigerated in our spare frig. The shelf life is extra long this way.  I'm guessing it'll be used up very quickly anyway because my wife just discovered my stash and likes using it on her salads. It also makes great lemonade. A squirt in the ice tea during summer means adding just the right amount of tartness. Good stuff. I will be buying more.

Now we use less sugar when making lemonade and when poured straight into water it is very tasty. We will be purchasing this again.<br /><br />As an aside, I left positing packaging feedback on this item. It was one of the best packed things we have ever received from Amazon. In a box with custom Styrofoam and well marked "fragile" there is no worry over these getting damaged in transit.<br /><br />A suggestion to Lakewood: I would love to see these in 16 ounces instead.

review/summary: Use this product to make hard lemonade (Home Brew)
review/text: 1) I bought the case to make a 5 gallon batch of hard lemonade. If you arent going to juice your own lemons and want to be able to control the type of sugar added in your must you need to use juice. ReaLemon has preservatives that preclude it's use. Fresh squeezed is WAY too expensive, especially if you want to use organic lemons.<br /><br />2) I used two of the bottles for making lemonade, marinade and doing lemon drops. The only real difference I can see between this product and fresh squeezed is that it lacks the high note astringency that fresh squeezed has. This astringency can mask some of the bitterness inherent to lemon juice. It also does not give you the option to zest the lemon for the essential oils. The flavor is what you would get if you juiced your lemons and allowed it to sit in a bottle for a little while. Thats because that is what this is.<br /><br />FYI the recipe for hard lemonade:<br />2 pounds of light Munton's dried malt extract<br />15 pounds of raw sugar<br />125 ounces (basially a gallon) of this juice<br />Lalvin EC-1118 Yeast<br />2 tbsp of yeast nutrient<br />about 4 gallons of water<br /><br />It turned out awesome. About 16% ABV. I used way too much lemon rendering the drink difficult to consume straight from the bottle. However it was WAY too strong to drink that way. I used this blended 50/50 with a batch of Bavarian Wheat beer. It made a STELLAR shandy. My wife also used it blended with fresh brewed tea. Its what we drank for refreshment all summer. I made it strong and it was great blending with all sorts of fruit juices for sitting on the back porch in the heat of the summer. I'm doubling the recipe this summer it turned out so good but not using as much lemon juice. One case should make about 10 gallons of hard lemonade.

review/text: LAKEWOOD ORGANIC PURE LEMON JUICE, (here sold as) 12.5-OUNCE BOTTLES, PACK OF 12, tastes far better than my second choice, (Minute Maid Frozen Lemon Juice....which IS on the market, as of this writing...in stores, at least).  Lakewood Organic Pure Lemon Juice IS expensive......but I have seen tiny plastic containers, shaped like lemons, that ALSO are of organic lemon juice...that sell for much more.  Lakewood Organic Pure Lemon Juice is ALL JUICE, and NO WATER....so, (although the juice does not COME from concentrate), it IS, (IF you use lemon juice mainly to make lemonade, as I do), a concentrate, of sorts, (and a natural one!), all in itself.<br /><br />LAKEWOOD ORGANIC PURE LEMON JUICE has a much fresher, and more delicate flavour than Minute Maid Frozen Lemon Juice.  "Lighter" in this case does NOT mean less intense...it's just a teensy bit sweeter, that's all.  NATURALLY sweeter, I'm sure....!<br /><br />A few years ago, I began to weigh SO much that my doctors told me that the pre-diabetes I had had for years, had finally turned into real, Type 2 diabetes!  (Yikes!)  However, just about that time, I had made arrangements to visit a friend<br />in Canada for about 3 weeks....and, having taken the cheapest tickets available, could NOT ask for a refund.  The doctor said it would be OK to go....IF I took things slow and easy, gave myself an extra 2 hours to reach the airport, and took things VERY easy whilst I was on the trip.  And -- try to lose some weight, and cut down, (drastically), on the sugar, fat, and cholesterol,  I took his advice, and, armed with several pamphlets for new diabetics, I boarded the plane to see my friend.<br /><br />We had a nice visit....but unfortunately, I wasn't able to go to all the places I had planned on going.  (I comforted myself with the thought that the "Chateau Fontenac", one of Quebec's premier attractions, had been around a lONG time, and if I didn't see it on THIS visit, I would probably be able to go there next time.<br />I went shopping with my friend, but cut down the shopping trip strictly to 3 hours, and didn't visit all the departments at "The Bay" department store that I wanted to see.  But I did see a lot of my friend and her family....and that's what made the trip most worth-while.<br /><br />Since I had seen her, she and her family had picked up a habit of drinking a LOT of lemonade.  I joined them in this....and found I liked lemonade a lot more than I remembered liking it.  A quick call to my doctor in the States confirmed that this was OK....as long as I didn't drink more than half-a-gallon a day, and had VERY, VERY little sugar in it.  In actuality, I had NO sugar at all in my lemonade....sweetening it instead with the CANADIAN type of Sweet'N'Low...which has CYCLAMATES in it.  (Cyclamates are banned in the US because they killed some rats once....but they haven't killed any Canadian HUMANS!)<br /><br />After 3 weeks of my friend's mom's good home-cooking, (modified for diabetics...a thing she knew well how to do, because her father had had diabetes), and lots of lemonade, MADE ME LOSE WEIGHT!  Before leaving my friend's home, I weighed myself....and found I HAD LOST 30 POUNDS!<br /><br />Back in the U.S., I went to see my doctor.  As always, he took a blood test whilst I was there, and had me call back the next week to hear the results.  AND THE RESULTS SHOWED....................THAT I HAD L O S T THE DIABETES!!!!!!<br /><br />I hadn't excercised much in Canada....but I HAD drunk a GREAT DEAL OF LEMONADE!<br />I'm sure that's what made me lose the weight!  In fact, I've recenlty discovered a book on Amazon, called "THE LEMON JUICE DIET".  My friend and her family had not mentioned that Lemonade would help me lose weight -- I guess they knew this, but considered it such an obvious piece of knowledge that they hadn't even mentioned it!  I had lost weight on drinking lots of lemonade, even without them mentioning it -- OR reading this book!<br /><br />I'm sure lemon juice is good for many other things too.  (Must research this!)  In the meantime, I'll stick with LAKEWOOD ORGANIC PURE LEMON JUICE.  If it's expensive, (and it is), I'll cut down on pizza, chocolate, and potato-chip buying.<br /><br />Somehow, I begin to wish I had bought more than one carton of this delicious and nutricious, (and organic!), lemon juice  : )

review/summary: Lakewood Organic PURE Lemon Juice
review/text: Lakewood Organic PURE Lemon Juice. I drink Lemonade on a daily routine and the "real lemom" and "imitation substitutes" just doesn`t make it with me. This is real 100% lemon juice and makes perfect lemonade very quickly and no hassel, just a bit pricey but the issues of easy to use in my situation makes it worth the extra cost. I mix one 12.5 ounce bottle of this juice with one cup Splenda granulated sweetner with 2 quarts water and done.

review/summary: NOT as good as fresh squeezed
review/text: This not-from-concentrate is fairly expensive and yet still comes with a "bite" (abet, somewhat less than ReaLemon). Also, I find I must use half again more than fresh squeezed to get the same lemony flavor. The idea one can't easily tell this from fresh squeezed is just untrue - I was surprised and disappointed (with the cost greater than fresh squeezed) after reading all the 5-star reviews. It costs 39 cents an ounce.<br /><br />Other options include:<br /><br />Crystal Light: Quickest for adding lemon to liquids - although not real lemon flavor it does not have the "bite" of packaged lemon juice. I am surprised to say this is currently my favorite additive when making a large amount of fresh tea. Also, it's the cheapest at 1 cent per ounce.<br /><br />ReaLemon from concentrate: Cheapest real lemon juice and available in individual packets (ReaLemon Juice Serve-A-Lemon). 15 cents an ounce (but 49 cents an ounce for individual packets). Worthy of four stars due to being less than a third the price of this product.<br /><br />Real lemons: Best flavor (no bitter "bite") but requires a lot of work to produce any quantity. Grabbing a lemon is easy for cooking but I like to make large quantities of tea with lemon juice requiring about 2 cups a week and I was hoping this product would help get me out of the work. But, fresh lemons seem the only way to go if flavor quality is important to you. 25-30 cents an ounce.<br /><br />BTW, these bottles IMHO are the largest container of lemon juice one should buy (I've never been able to use all of a 48 oz ReaLemon before needing to discard) as it should be consumed in less than 2 weeks once opened. I've come to realize, however, a cool way to keep lemon juice fresh is to make lemon ice cubes and (for example) throw a cube in with a defrosting piece of fish.<br /><br />There's no mention of what kind of lemons are used to make Lakewood's product (and an email over a week ago asking has not been answered), but the 40 different kinds of lemons each have very distint flavors. For example, Meyer or Ponderosa lemons are considerably sweeter than the Eureka or Lisbon varieties found in the supermarket (although they are not really lemons being they're crossed with mandarins or citrons respectively). Some also prefer Bearss or Eureka Pink. Perhaps, planting a seedless Lisbon (hardiest) is the best way to go. Better yet, a Meyer could be grown indoors in a large container and pruned if necessary. It doesn't have the spines or thorns of other varieties. Meyer popularity really climbed when Martha Stewart began featuring them in her recipes. Lemon trees were once grown only for ornamentation and aromaticity (before cheap sugar) and are still commonly used as such indoors. And so, I'm off to the local nursery. A 5-lbs Meyer plant should cost about the same as 5 pounds of Meyer lemons.

I also use the individual packs as they are easy to carry for traveling.  This is one product that does not contain aspartame as is Splenda and Equal.  This product is my choice of artificial sweetners.
