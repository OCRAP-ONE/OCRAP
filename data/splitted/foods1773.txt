review/summary: Mario's Sliced Black Olives with Jalapeno are a cut above!
review/text: Having ordered these 3 TIMES I consider myself a budding afficionado!  Mario's is a perfect sliced olive nicely paired with fresh chopped jalapeno bits, at the ready for whatever culinary treat you may have in mind.  I've put these in omelettes, salads, nachos...even pizza.  At 60 cals for the whole 2.25 oz. can, you can afford to splurge and just ENJOY them. The buttery richness of Mario olives rivals Black Pearl, and their light jalapeno heat is SPOT-ON.  Mildly spiced at 1 star's worth of warmth, you'll experience full FLAVOR, without the burning lips.  OLIVE HEAVEN!

review/summary: Caramel Perfection
review/text: Light Muscovado is a caramel light brown sugar with the flavors of earth and sky somehow infused into dreamy sweet perfection. All other light brown sugars can't compare to this quality and if you want the best light brown sugar for baking, I can't imagine anything could be more delicious.<br /><br />Light Muscovado is slightly moist, has a medium molasses content and is delicious in gingerbread, coffee cake, cookies and chocolate cake. It is delicious with a Farina porridge in the morning or can be stirred into tea.<br /><br />I first found this sugar while working at Larry's Market in Seattle. The India Tree company is also located in Seattle and has some amazing sugar products for baking and decorating.<br /><br />Also recommended: Dark Muscovado is also deeply delicious and once you use the Muscovado sugars, there is no escape. You will crave the rich flavors and high molasses content of this delicious sugar from Mauritius.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Excellent Flavor - A Good Brand of Sugar
review/text: I bought both the light as well as the dark muscovado sugar. The flavor of the muscovado sugar is intense and is excellent. I used it for baking as well as in desserts and I never go back to the standard brown sugar anymore. It comes in a pack of 4, 1 pound each which is a lot. I wish they will sell it in smaller packages. Out of the 4 packs that I received, 1 pack was already dried out and hardened. I can still use it but I had to literally break up the sugar in order to use it, which is a lot of work. This is typical of brown sugar when it has been kept for too long or it wasn't stored in a cool dry place, hence my request for smaller packages.

review/summary: Great
review/text: I have never tried Muscovado sugar, and I can say it is delicious. Less processing = more natural nutrition that is essentially non existent in typical brown sugar. We went with the light Muscovado in case the molasses taste was too strong. You can still definitely smell and taste some great molasses flavor in this sugar. It went great in a homemade apple pie, cookies, oatmeal, coffee, tea, etc. Good stuff.

review/summary: Muscovado All The Way
review/text: Great for sweetening coffee and oatmeal. I have found many amazing things to do with muscovado sugar and I will never go back to artificial sweeteners again!!<br /><br />Another one I constantly use is the brand called EL MAESTRO and I usually buy it on ebay. It has a pure, strong molasses taste much that I absolutely love. I believe its imported from the Philippines where they specialize in that. Don't get me wrong, both El Maestro and India Tree are amazing products!!<br /><br />But yeah, you can't compare muscovado sugar to any other sugars out there. Perfect with any recipe, especially coffee and tea... and marinating meats!

review/text: The taste factor of my baked goods has gone up several notches of deliciousness (word?) since switching to this brown sugar. There is no comparison to the usual grocery store stuff! I could even tell the difference in quality just by the smooth texture and yummy aroma of this muscovado. Chocolate chip cookes, candies, any baking at all will taste wonderful using this product. The quality really comes through.

review/text: I use sugar for most of my tea's and coffee's. My girl brought back some sugar from Mauritius before, and I thought I would not be able to find it again. And now we are reunited once again. I see it at some specialty grocery stores, but the price here on Amazon is pretty good and all of the packs come fresh. It has a nice subtle molasses flavor to it, and it really goes well with drinks. I havent used it for cooking yet, but I guess it would work too. I would absolutely recommend this sugar.

review/text: Bars are around the size of slices of nature valley together. (maybe a little thinner). They are sweet, and I can usually eat 1 or 2 instead of 5 chewy brand bars. For 40-45 dollars, the weight/price ratio is better than 20 dollars for 60 tiny chewy bars. Since they are my only snack atm, I've gotten a little tired of eating these bars after two boxes. The almonds ones only have 1-3 almonds per bar.

This product is not only gluten free, but it contains WILD Salmon, not farm raised, which I greatly prefer.

The seller is letting me return the bottle, but is requiring that I pay for shipping again, so I would be very unlikely to order from them again.

I shared them with a select group of individuals but mainly ate them all myself. They are irresistible. I will be buying more before summer.

But most of the teas are wonderful.  You don't have to use very much so it goes a long way.  And the containers are great with the glass top to use for other things later. The cost is pretty high I think, but the quality and taste of the tea is very good so overall I would say it is worth having the samples so you know which tea you like and which ones you don't care for at all.

It's been a wonderful gift, and I look forward to my morning and afternoon cups every day :) In fact, I'm having a cup of rooibos chocolate mint as I type. All of these teas also work really well with the Kati brewing system found on teaforte.com. Check it out!

For the Starburst, half of them are original, then there are some with very nasty flavors, like banana-kiwi, which is just disgusting.  Overall 2.5 / 5 stars because only half of the pack (all of the originals) were good and the rest I had to give away (too nasty to eat, but fun to watch friends try them).

review/text: Like other reviewer's here, we've tried several of Betty Lou's delicious, healthy snacks in our home, including the peanut butter and the spirulina nut butter balls, but these Betty Lou's Coconut Macadamia Nut Butter Balls have become our new favorite. They are low in carbs, high in protein and thoroughly tasty. The coconut coating is particularly enticing. An excellent, convenient, nutritious snack for anytime of the day. Betty Lou strikes again!

review/summary: FANTASTIC!
review/text: I've been gluten free for about three months, and as someone with a sweet tooth, I've been a bit bummed lately at the lack of easy and quick treats I can find or keep on hand.<br /><br />I went to the health food store and bought one of these individually to give it a try. I opened it in the car and almost went back in for more right then! Only the rain and a need to get on with my day held me back. I will most definitely be buying more.<br /><br />If you like macaroons, these are fairly similar, crunchy but chewy, soft, sweet and tasty.

review/summary: Extremely sweet, but O.K.
review/text: Betty Lou's Coconut Macadamia Balls would be a much sought after snack at our home if only they were not soooooo sicky sweet.  I do realize that probably a lot of people love "food" that is that sweet.<br /><br />At our house, we do not consider snacks that have a large dose of natural sweetness to them in need of excess agave and stevia to make them taste like pure candy.  We would definitely eat these snacks regularly if they tasted like the coconut and macnut, instead of like concentrated sweeteners!<br /><br />Try the Spirulina Ginseng Balls! They are AWESOME and very well liked, even by our children. The Spirulina Balls are also great for energy, and you know you are getting food worth eating, even when on the run!  I love that these healthy little guys fit in my purse or pocket for a quick snack OR when I have to miss a meal.

review/summary: Quick and healthy snack.
review/text: It's a matter of taste but these are sweet and healthy as a snack.  I prefer the peanut butter balls which are my favorite but this is not to say the Macadamia balls aren't as flavorful.  They are filling and I suspect healthier than a candybar.  I have children with Celiac Disease.  It's hard to find safe pre-made snacks for them to eat and this fits the bill.  Being individually wrapped, they slip into a purse or can sit by the bedside for hunger cravings.  Not all the Betty Lou's products list gluten-free so one needs to read each one carefully.  Also these products list that they may be made in a factory which may also process wheat products so for people being extra careful with gluten contact, this may not be a product for you.

review/summary: Yum! Corn Free!
review/text: I bought these because I have a corn allergy and wanted to substitute them for the LA Weightloss bars that list corn syrup as the first ingredient.  I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty! My favorites are actually the Fudgie Filberts that taste similar to a Little Debbie brownie if Little Debbie's were diet. Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second. Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others. My husband didn't like any of them but could tolerate the one I liked least, Peanut Butter.  Over all I think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions. I think I would have picked a different name than Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls.  Nut Butter Balls doesn't sound as appetizing as what they actually are!! Nut Butter Balls.....Mmmmmm!

review/text: My older daughter and I love these, they taste great and are filling and a good snack or even meal substitute.  However my younger daughter is allergic to something in them, even though she has eaten all of the ingredients separately with no problem.  She is also allergic to blackberries so maybe there is some kind of connection there.  She took one bite and then said they caused her mouth to itch and feel weird.  After she said this, I realized I also felt this, but maybe to a lesser degree and definitely not enough for me to stop eating it!!  They are pretty awesome, but I wish I knew why they cause an allergic reaction in my 13 yr. old daughter.

review/summary: Yummers! A Candy-like Treat
review/text: I got these on a whim... another impulse buy while killing time on Amazon when I'm supposed to be doing something productive. I was scoping some high protein snacks and I was immediately seduced by the combination of words coconut/macadamia/nut butter. And balls. These shipped really fast and I tried one as soon as I opened the box. The "balls" are chewy and sweet and taste like candy, but with that protein-powder taste. I happen to like that taste so I think it's great. The coconut flake on the outside is super good but not much macadamia flavor comes through. Still really good though. I will definitely be eating these when I am craving something sweet or stash some in my school bag to take on the go. I want to try some of the other flavors in the future, but I am going to try to make this box last... yeah, like that will really happen! I wish they came in a multi-flavored sampler pack. Or rather, a sack. A sack would definitely be better. Thumbs up for these yummy balls!

review/summary: Excellent Nutritional Profile: High Protein, Low Sugar
review/text: EDIT 1/2/2012<br />So I picked up a new box of these recently and they taster AWEFUL.  Note in my review below that I previously liked these.  There obviously was some sort of manufacturing defect at work or a really bad formula change...but this is less likely as they really just tasted "off".  Instead of the "buttery", nutty flavor it was dry and "chemical" tasting.  I may try one more time (buying from a different source), but this experience at least highlights a deficiency in quality control.<br /><br />ORIGINAL-------<br />I guess taste is a personal preference, but as someone who enjoys coconut, I really like the taste of these.<br /><br />The Nutritional Profile on these is excellent:<br />- 10g of protein in a 40g serving is a powerful protein punch<br />- Only 2g Saturated fat compares very well to other bars<br />- Only 8g of sugar.  Without use of artificially sweeteners, this is among the lowest I have seen in such bars<br />- Gluten and Soy free are also good<br />On the downside<br />- They contain dairy, specifically Whey protein (personally I'd rather have Soy)<br /><br />If you were considering <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V0QW3S">Betty Lou's Almond Butter High Protein Balls, 1.75-Ounce Packages (Pack of 18)</a> for your protein needs, you may want to reconsider.  These coconut macadamia are 25% protein, while the Almond Butter are actually 24% with a bigger serving, more calories, and less Fiber.<br /><br />A comparable bar (in terms of nutritional profile) to this coconut macadamia ball, and without the dairy, is coconut macadamia <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0DMMY">KIND PLUS, Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/summary: A dissapointment
review/text: I had high hopes for these, especially based on many raving reviews, but I don't like them much. There is a very intense aftertaste, much like the taste you get from some artificially flavored/sweetened whey powders. It's amazing actually that I really love pretty much all the ingredients of this separately, but when they put it together it's pretty bad! They would be really satisfying as a healthy, high-energy snack ... if they just tasted a little/a lot better.

review/text: I love these! Soft and squishy, great coconutty coating. I highly reccommend these to any health foodie. They have the consistancy of cookie dough with little bits of nuts. Great not so sweet flavor and yes, not really overwhelmingly macadamia nut flavored. I only wish they were bigger. I also have the Spirulina and Ginseng from Betty Lou and love them but these IMO are even better. I have any many others have repeatedly stated, these don't taste like candy bars. If you want candy-bar sweet, get a candy bar. These are made for those of us trying to eat "clean" but still craving a treat . Great tasting with great ingredients, what is better?

review/summary: Make Sure You Like Coconut
review/text: This is the second flavor of Betty Lou's nut butter balls that I have tried -- the first was the Peanut Butter.  Even though I am not a coconut person, I thought I would try these because they only have 150 calories versus 190 calories for the Peanut Butter Balls.<br /><br />Well, I don't like these at all -- they have an overwhelming coconut flavor. Reminds me of eating suntan lotion. However, if you are a coconut person, you might love them.<br /><br />I'll continue to work my way through the Betty Lou flavors until I find a favorite. I do think Betty Lou's are the perfect afternoon snack -- a relatively low-calorie, healthy snack that can keep you away from the junk food and tide you over until dinner.

review/text: This is a Herdez product, which means its also a Hormel product. And while I'm<br />not a fan of Hormel, the Herdez subsidiary is still doing it right!<br /><br />I was reluctant to try this sauce cause I had its twin brother (Chipotle) and<br />thought it was terrible. This stuff however has earned a place in the cabinet<br />for its flavor and versatility.<br /><br />First of all this sauce is clearly made from fully ripened Jalapeno peppers, so<br />this sauce has fruity more mature flavor, rather than the alfalfa-like greenish<br />flavor of the unripened green jalapenos. The carrots and sugar also cut the normal<br />bite of the jalapenos, and give this a very mild faintly sweet flavor.<br /><br />Its more complex than your typical Mexican style sauces, and the frutiness of the<br />chilis really shine through with a hint of lemony/herbal flavor in the background.<br />The consistency is also fairly thick which means its perfect for tacos, beans,<br />and any other Mexican dish you can think of. Also works well on burgers and as an<br />additive to off the shelf barbecue sauce. 4 Scovies!

Can help a sore throat. 2. Shelf life says 2009-2011 (although I wouldn't doubt it would be ok beyond that if kept right, being so salty), not bad to keep something sweet&salty for emergency.<br /><br />My favourite salty candy is the little "saltier" sort like Tyrkisk peber. When it comes to sweet licorice my fav. is the Schoolkrijt (chalk licorice), but K&H diamonds lasts me a little longer.<br /><br />K&H diamonds also brings me childhood memories when I used to buy these and similar for 1c a piece, K&H always tasted the best after swim school, I think because to clean out that nasty chlorine taste, it takes something special.<br /><br />I have not been able to find any decent licorice candy where I live.

The licorice I was used to as a kid wasn't really soft and sweet so, by the description of these, I thought I'd hit the jackpot. SO wrong! These are VERY salty.  I couldn't finish even 1 piece, I had to spit it out! It's like swallowing sea water. All 5 members of my family tried a piece and not 1 piece was swallowed! Very disappointed and a big waste of $23.

review/summary: Horrible experience
review/text: I ordered these flowers for my mother's birthday, 2/17, on 2/16 in the early afternoon Mountain time to be delivered the next day. I expected 24 red roses in a red vase to be delivered just like the picture leads one to believe.<br /><br />The flowers never arrived on the 17th. When I contacted Pro-Flowers, they advised me that they did not receive the order until 10:39AM 2/17 and do not do same day delivery but the flowers would be delivered the next day. Ok, I can understand this. A day late is not acceptable but I can deal with it. Amazon must have had technical issues.<br /><br />The flowers were delivered 2/18. There were only 12 with a white vase. Of the 12, 8 were tiny roses. Nothing at all like the picture which is displayed.<br /><br />I spoke with Christine and explained the issue. She apparently had computer issues but could give me no information beyond the fact they were delivered because she had computer issues. She tried to transfer me to a supervisor, where I held for over 20 minutes and finally tried calling back. Spoke with Babbette, who pulled up the order. When I asked when the order was placed, she also placed me on hold for a few minutes. She came back and when I explained that the situation was not acceptable, she placed me on hold again for 5 minutes. At this point, she offered to replace them; however, the gift that I purchased to bring joy and a smile became nothing more than a headache. She blamed Amazon's system and beyond the fact that only 12 were delivered, they delivered on time.<br /><br />I will pay the additional money next time and order from another company who can deliver on what they advertise.

review/summary: Disappointed... Extremely!!!
review/text: Flowers arrived limp and dead. I had ordered Roses, but they sent me something else. I don't know what they are, because they are mostly dead. The first impression is the one that counts. The recipient was very disappointed and thought it was done on purpose to piss her off. No replacement flowers, refund, or resending the correct ones will undo the damage. Thanks ProFlowers.<br /><br />First I only complained (did not ask for a refund out right) because I had one more day fordelivery. "Mike" assured me I would get them the following day in the morning, so I waited. I did not receive the order by 10AM so I called. They had no record of a replacement order and said they have over 200 employees with many "Mikes". When I requested same day delivery (because of my problem), they said they could not deliver the same day, even though they offer this service online. So now it is Friday and mother's day is on Sunday. I don't have any Roses with a refund that means nothing.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THESE GUYS. I also have experience with 1800flowers, but they also made mistakes sending the wrong/dead flowers. To be fair, they only screwed up 1 time out of 7 orders. But that one time was enough for me to look like a cheap fool and go to ProFlowers, and now this! Walk to your local florist and have them deliver the old fashion way.

review/summary: worst experience with delivered flowers ever
review/text: I have never had a worse experience with delivered flowers.<br /><br />It started out when placing the order...  The previous times I ordered flowers through Amazon, I was given options to select the delivery date, as well as what to say on the card.  This vendor had no such options.  During the order process I was informed it would take 1 to 3 business days.  Since I was ordering in advance, 1 to 3 days was enough.  3 days would be on-time, and one day would make my wife happy as she would get to enjoy them for the whole week...<br /><br />4 days after placing the order, the tracking status shows that the delivery estimate was changed to 2 to 10 days.  Worse, the tracking info indicated the shipper (fedex) was holding the order back, but I could go pick it up if I wanted.  Keep in mind that I'm shipping it to an office building that gets fed-ex shipments daily.  Apparently they shipped with a super-low-priority option allowing the shipper to delay the shipment.<br /><br />Sure, I could go pick them up 35 miles away at the FedEx warehouse, and drive to the opposite side of town to deliver them myself...  Of course the reason I ordered delivered flowers was because I wanted to pay someone else to deliver them for me.  I wouldn't mail-order flowers that I can buy at the grocery store, if I planned to deliver them myself.<br /><br />So here I sit, a week after I placed the order, wondering if they might be delivered soon...  With amazon telling me that, for sure, they will be there by next week.<br /><br />So what kind of condition will roses be in after a week and a half being tossed around in a cardboard box?  And I paid for this?<br /><br />There are 123 florists in this town, and they all are affiliated with 1 or more florist delivery networks.  So getting flowers delivered fresh from a florist should never need to involve Fed-ex.  But I guess I get what I paid for, if I wanted real service, I should have paid a real florist for real florist service (or do it myself).<br /><br />I'm sure that my bad experience is partially because of my own high expectations from having used flower services for the last 20 years, always getting next day (or same day) delivery of my orders.  The last time Amazon forced me into 2-day delivery expectations, which was ok as that was explained up-front and I got exactly that.<br /><br />But this time I was promised 1-3 days before I was charged, then promised 2-10 days after it was too late to make a different choice.  That is called bait and switch.  Perhaps the delivery estimate provided by Amazon is not based on the original representation in the shopping card, but that wouldn't matter if the item had arrived on time.  Perhaps it is all FedEx's fault...  But that is what is being sold, so the delivery service is part of what is being sold...  So even if the seller is blame-free for my poor experience, it is the sum of my experience<br />with the vendor AND the delivery service that counts toward my ability to enjoy my purchase.<br /><br />I would suggest avoiding this vendor.  Use vendors that are part of a reputable florist network.

review/summary: Roses Shipment
review/text: I ordered roses from Amazon earlier this month for a birthday on the 22 of January 2011.  I opted for a delivery date of 21  January 2011. The shipment arrive via UPS on the date requested. The delivery, from Pro Flowers, began on the morning of the 20th. and arrived at my residence at approximately 3:31 P.M. on 21 January 2011. The temperatures on the beginning date and ending date were at or below zero. Needless to say I was not happy with the condition of the roses as they arrived at my residence. I would certaninly call into question the time line associated with the delivery of such perishable items. In the future I will rely on a local florist for such transactions.

I also checked other products from ProFlowers and they were actually a bit gray.<br /><br />I was afraid of ordering this, but at the end i decided to do it.<br /><br />Shipping: The package arrived on time.<br /><br />Package: the flowers were nicely wrapped, and inside a box, it was actually an excellent package that protected the flowers and the vase very well.<br /><br />Roses: there were 24 roses, very nice roses, good size, and color.<br /><br />Duration: the flowers indeed last for 7 days in an excellent state, and they actually lasted for longer.<br /><br />I recommend this product, and the starglazer lillies form Proflowers.<br /><br />I didnt put 5 stars, cuz i was expecting the red nice vase from the pic.

review/text: The roses showed up quickly, so very little damage from lack of water/sunlight but they showed up with several flowers smaller than indicated on the picture, considerably smaller.<br />After putting them in water and letting then breathe a little, they grew to slightly bigger sizes but never got to the size of the pic.<br /><br />If you are within driving dance of a flower shop and your recipient is close, I would suggest going that route.<br />To much anonymity when you buy from this seller, so you have no idea what condition it is going to show up in.<br /><br />However, with that said, and my recipient being 4 states away from me, it is a much better price option buying from this seller than a normal flower shop.<br /><br />It as its pros and cons, but I will buy from them again.

The only problem was that they all different arrive at the same timebut the baker's dozen more than made up for it.  But they did arrive on the same day.

review/text: As a married man, I'm constantly in a state of conflict. Left to my own devices, I'm perfectly content to shovel food, guzzle beer, emit various gasses and generally befoul my surroundings like the coothless savage half-shaven chimp I am. But with the missus around, I'm compelled to be on my best behavior -- for the next forty to sixty years. Or until I drop dead of an aneurysm from trying to remember which fork to eat salad with, or which indistinguishable shade of white I'm supposed to paint the bathroom. Clearly, I need some help.<br /><br />Nothing says "love" like "Honey, I'm sorry I'm a slack-jawed Neanderthal with the social graces of a lobotomized hyena."<br /><br />And nothing says "I'm sorry" better than roses. Lots and lots and lots of roses.<br /><br />So I figure, screw it. It's too hard acting civilized, trying to look sharp and walking the straight, narrow and uncomfortable path that leads to Miss Manners' cottage. The lessons are unlikely to stick, anyway, so I might as well get on with my filthy heathen life and apologize with flowers when I step out of line.<br /><br />With lots. And lots. And LOTS of flowers.<br /><br />Yeah, it could get a tad expensive. But if the alternative is 'fork classes' and learning the difference between eggshell and ecru, then color me rosy. At least it'll keep me out of the doghouse... right?

review/summary: Beautiful Flowers Delivered On Time
review/text: I am very pleased with this product. It arrived on time, and the flowers are beautiful. When I initially ordered them, I thought they would be delivered by a local vendor. I had no idea they would be shipped from Florida. They arrived in excellent condition, and my wife was very pleased with the order. I would buy from them again.
