review/text: Smiles... Thank you Lord, for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted, and tastes great. I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this. The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture. It's slightly hard/crunchy, but not a problem at all. I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you.

review/summary: My favorite Kettle Chip
review/text: These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag.

review/summary: Best salt & vinegar chips out there!
review/text: Salt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I've tried every brand out there.  These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.

review/summary: Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .
review/text: My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .

review/summary: Great Tasting Chips
review/text: After looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box, I had to write a review.  I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.  There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.  I'll buy these again...soon.

review/summary: Kettle Chips, Sea Salt
review/text: There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The "best by" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October.

review/text: I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle.  When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.99/case, I put my order without doubt.  However, when I received the case, I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August.  I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips.  I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable!  How convenient!  Although I love this chips, I won't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date...

review/text: This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them. We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags. The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal. The chips are so delicious, baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt. They have 0 fat, no preservatives, nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients. What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip!

review/text: These are the best spicy chips I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  They start off sweet, then as you eat more the spice builds up.  They are fantastic.  If you don't want to commit to a whole case, pick up a bag at your local Whole Foods first, then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are.  Got my case right here, and loving every bite.  On a side note, this brand (Kettle Brand) has many delicious varieties- this is just my personal favorite.  I also highly recommend: Backyard BBQ, Honey Dijon, Sweet Onion, Buffalo Bleu, Salt and Pepper and Death Valley Chipotle.  Lays aint got nothin on Kettle Brand!!!

review/text: Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors. My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon. I think it's a great combination sweet, salty and tangy, perfect for one of those snack attacks when you don't know exactly what you want. I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch. These 2-oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions (like me!).

review/summary: One bite and you'll become a "chippoisseur"
review/text: As an Oregonian, I make a point of sharing these Oregon-made snacks with friends who visit the state. I tell them the Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a>.<br /><br />The Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing. The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />In summary, I highly recommend Kettle Brand chips, a great buy on Amazon.com.

review/text: These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're "kettle chips" and they're "fried" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!

review/summary: Kettle Foods Spicy Thai Chips
review/text: The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed "ginger with attitude" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  "Great Taste Naturally" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!

I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!<br />I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring.

review/summary: 4 Stars for price and taste
review/text: I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars.

review/summary: CRISPY, CRUNCHY, AND ROBUST
review/text: We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.<br /><br />  Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt.

review/summary: Tangy and delicious snack
review/text: For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less "natural" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!

review/summary: Things you need to know
review/text: Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes "too much". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are "Krinkle Cut" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.

review/summary: I made a mistake.....
review/text: This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  � homiedog �

review/summary: Do they have to "bite back"?
review/text: I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.

review/text: I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.

review/summary: Pleasant beverage, convenient format!
review/text: This product converted me, I kid you not. Before: I did not think I liked instant coffee. Now: I think I do! :-)<br /><br />I've tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E50TSS">International Coffee</a> type products, which are powdered drink mixes and not truly instant coffee, and I was never very impressed. Eventually, I learned (and you'll laugh at me for not knowing this) that instant coffee is not a "mix" like hot chocolate but actually coffee beans treated differently in their production from coffee beans intended to be brewed. The bean is roasted as usual, then crushed (rather than cut as for brewing beans) in preparation for creating a coffee "concentrate" that will then be either freeze dried or spray dried. This product (as explained on the Nescafe website) is Robusta and Arabica beans, freeze dried, a method which may or may not be the top choice for connoisseurs of instant coffee, but being new to instant coffee I don't yet appreciate the difference.<br /><br />I do know that the product in these single-serving sticks is the same product that was sold in canisters, before. This is just a new format for their current product, not a new product. And wow, for the sheer pleasure and convenience, it's a decent cup of coffee! It can't be mistaken for richly brewed coffee from a restaurant or from your home coffee machine, not even if you douse it with cream, but instead I compare it to "office" coffee, or 'cafe au cube farm', which it definitely matches in taste and quality. Easy, quick, mellow. Great idea when I'm the only soul who wants a cup of coffee and can't bear to brew just one or two lonely cups.<br /><br />The big disadvantage of instant coffee, as far as I'm concerned, is that a serving of this product has only abut 65mg of caffeine compared to 45-180mg of caffeine in a brewed cup of coffee (we're talking in the upper end the way I brew mine!). I want my caffeine! The flavored versions of this product have even less caffeine per serving (at 25-30mg) although I couldn't tell you why. (This information, by the way, comes from the Nescafe website FAQ.) The other disadvantage, I suppose, is that the whole house doesn't fill with the sound and fragrance of brewing coffee when I choose to go instant. Alas.<br /><br />Still, given the convenience and the decency of the beverage itself, I'm now buying these little "single sticks" pretty regularly! Recommended. :-)

review/text: I have been very interested in Starbucks Via instant coffee line, and it made me take a new look at Taster's Choice. I was pleasantly surprised by the good taste.<br /><br />I am a coffee fan that is often on the go, and I am going to use Taster's Choice to keep in my briefcase and car.<br /><br />Give it a try, and you'll enjoy Taster's Choice. Via costs $10 for 12 servings with only a slightly better taste. I would rather pay a tenth of the price and have the convenient tubes of Taster's Choice.<br /><br />Frugal is in and so are Taster's Choice Single Sticks.

review/summary: pretty good for an instant
review/text: I don't usually drink/buy instant coffee, but since I got a sample of these I had no reason to not try it. It is very quick, empty the packet in a mug, add 6 ounces of hot water and stir. In a standard coffee mug, 6 ounces is slightly over half a cup so that was a little disappointing. The flavor was not the best but if you are really jonesing for a cup of coffee and don't have a lot of time or don't want to brew a whole pot, it will do the trick.

review/summary: Great instant coffee and mixer for mochas
review/text: My issue with instant coffees has always been that they are good when you first open the jar but in a couple of days the crystals acquire other tastes (stale).<br /><br />Not an issue anymore with these individual packets. Fresh to open every time. I find them a much better value than Via and they are pure old-time coffee (who knows what Starbucks is putting in their grounds).<br /><br />This product has also solved one of my longstanding issues with General Foods International Coffees: not enough coffee flavor. Those little cans were $4.00 and it took half the can to get anything like a coffee flavor with the sugars -- Cafe Vienna is my favourite.<br /><br />Now, a heaping spoonful (or two, but instead of six) of Vienna with a packet of Taster's Choice and voila', I'm back in Europe!<br /><br />Also works with instant coccoa to take the sugary edge off.<br /><br />I'm defintely buying more when I run out.

review/text: I used to not be able to tell the difference between any types of coffee. Now I can tell the difference between instant coffee, and not instant coffee. Once you get used to it, it's fine and I actually look forward to drinking it these days. Extremely convenient because all you need is hot water. In fact, if you just add it to a cup, you don't even have to stir it because it'll permeate through the water in a couple minutes.<br /><br />Super Convenient.<br />Not so great tasting, but good enough.<br /><br />::EDIT::<br />A couple months after writing this review, I had the chance to try some other instant coffees. And this is by far the best. So I've changed my opinion on this. Also, for added kick, add two packets to one cup.

I tried it out in a taste test just recently, and I was definitely appauled. But with Taster's Choice instant, I definitely knew it was one of the best. But when I found out they had on-the-go packs, I was even more impressed. Taster's Choice on-the-go packs are easy to drink, and taste just like you're tasting a freshly made cup of coffee each and every time. I loved the taste, because it was delightful, and carries more at a very inexpensive price. Overall, I really suggest you buy Taster's Choice on-the-go packs. They not only are worth the money, but the taste is definitely the strongest with each and every cup.

review/summary: Nescafe a joke!
review/text: I woke up today, Sunday, to find my Sunday newspaper for the Chicago Tribune wrapped in a plastic bag with the words, "our instant tastes rich not expensive (sorry Starbucks)"<br /><br />Naturally, I decided to put your Taster's Choice packet to the test.  Could you please define the word "rich" according to your dictionary.  To the rest of the world, rich implies full-bodied in a drink.  Nothing about your instant coffee is rich.  It is quite the opposite actually.  The finished product with 6oz of water look exactly like that, dirty water.  Looks like something that would come out of my rain gutter, not my coffee pot.<br /><br />It's tastes is repulsive.  In fact, if I liked drinking hot water, you might have a market.<br /><br />I would reason that the fact your coffee costs "4x less than Starbucks Via" is because it is made with 4x less quality.  The taste is in the cup.  You should be embarrassed that you call yourself "Taster's Choice"  Who's choice?  A zombie?<br /><br />Also, how low can you go?  Your text font on your bag is exactly as Starbucks VIA in their stores.  Come on!  Be original!  Don't sit on the defensive side and use the same ideas as others.  It sounds like someone is losing business on a product that has been horrible from the beginning and is facing real competition.  Maybe you should spend less money on the marketing of the same recipe of Taster's Choice and more money on the development of something that actually is able to compete with VIA.  Back to the drawing board Nescafe.  Your product is horrible and the taste is in the package.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  In fact, as a coffee lover, I will make sure everyone I know makes "the smart choice" and chooses anything BUT Taster's Choice!

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: I am by no means a coffee expert, but you would have to have a string of mental conditions to prefer this "coffee" over mud in a cup.  The taste is terrible at best, no amount of sugar and cream added makes it more tolerable, and quite honestly, there is a reason why Via sells better.  IT TASTES BETTER.  For several reasons I might add.  You can get it in a variety of flavors, so finding one you truly enjoy isn't difficult at all (unlike Taster's Choice),<br />Starbuck's spent an incredible amount of time and effort perfecting the instant coffee while Nestle appears to have pulled theirs outta their lower back.<br /><br />Long story short....if you like coffee, don't even try to settle for this.<br /><br />If, however, you have no love for coffee, and are solely interested in a bit of caffeine, I guess this would suffice, but honestly there are less disgusting ways to get it (apples for example).

review/summary: Tastes better than bologna, but no ham or pork roast flavor
review/text: We have tried the log, thick slice, and thin slice versions.  The thinner the slice, the faster to cook and overcook.  We never found the correct way to cook this without causing it to dry out.  We never steamed it.  We prefer the thicker slice version.<br /><br />The high cost we assume is based on four factors; high density product, reduced fat, high spice content, and presumably using better cuts of meat.  When fat is reduced, the desired flavor profile requires more spices, but makes cooking more difficult.<br /><br />The texture is closer to hard (than soft) salami.  The fat content appears much less than bologna or spam lite.  Spam does have hints of ham flavor after slow frying; not discerned in (this brand of) pork roll. Excepting any ham flavor, the flavor profile is stronger and better than (regular) bologna and distinct from spam, in our opinion.  The first time we tried it, everyone designated it as "Beverly Hills spam."  Unlike my former acquaintances from Jersey and Philly, we were not won over, but understood their longing for memorable home foods.<br /><br />Our local Publix carries the thin sliced version and the one-pound mini-log ($8), whereas we previously ordered online or found it while traveling.  If you elect to try it, invite some friends over for a sharing experience...just ensure you have practiced cooking it to your satisfaction before offering it to a group.  We shared our log at a family gathering and also received the routine comment..."It reminds us of spam."

For breakfast take out the onion and add a hard fried egg and a dash of ketchup and use an English muffin.

review/summary: Big Success!
review/text: My sister lives in NJ and raves about this product.  She has it as a breakfast sandwich all the time.  I knew absolutely nothing about it and found out it's a local product in NJ from a NJ manufacturer.  The company that sells it online(LIL-BIGSHOTS) gets my rave review.  It was hot hot hot out, and they managed to put enough ice packs and dry ice in to keep the shipment frozen for the delivery time.  I've had companies which had much better packaging, but Lil-Bigshots got the pork roll to my house in nearly 100� weather and that's all that matters.  As a Southerner, I'm not sure what the fuss was about as far as the pork roll goes.  My friends had various comments about it as a step up or down from baloney depending on how funny they were trying to be.  BUT!  The person who loves it, my sister, got her pork roll sandwiches and she loved every bite.  And I love Lil-Bigshots for getting the product to me in time, frozen, and ready to go!

Simply pour into a glass and add water. Could it really be that good if so simple?<br /><br />A resounding YES. I was very surprised. I've been drinking green tea for awhile, so I can see where some may not like the taste at first. But as you continue it grows on you quickly. I tend to like my tea on the stronger side, so the next glass may use 2 packets instead of 1 and slightly more water. Other avid tea drinkers may consider the same.<br /><br />Overall, a great product. Can't wait to try it in a milkshake. :D

review/text: Okay, so Extra Sugar Free Dessert Delights Strawberry Shortcake gum doesn't taste at all like fresh strawberry shortcake, but it does taste exactly like Strawberry Shortcake, the doll.<br />It tastes exactly like the dolls smelled. Or, you could say it tastes like a stick of strawberry flavored chapstick melted in your mouth. How can gum taste like wax, you might ask? Well, somehow, it has this weird mouth-coating artificiality that almost exactly recreates the Strawberry Shortcake experience. In this, I am of course referring to the Strawberry Shortcake cartoon that my sister used to watch when we were 9 years old.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this gum, chewing it and imagining myself tearing the strawberry-scented hair from an undeserving brat's sacchirine cheerful little plastic doll, defying the little monster to attempt to stop me. It was a fantastic experience of um, fantasy.<br />I gave some to a coworker, and she loved it, too (but she has pica), and preferred it over the drywall she had been eating for lunch. Apparently, it's also 5 calories, which makes it slightly more fattening than that same wallboard, but less fattening than the chapstick she ate yesterday.<br />If you're on a diet, and have pica, and love Strawberry Shortcake, then this is your new favorite gum. Drop that wad of notebook paper you've been chewing on, and go pick some up.

The order arrived in a reasonable time, but as I started using the packs, discovered that I could not pull individual sticks from the packs - the sticks were sticking to the bottom of the pack. For each new pack, I have to remove all the sticks, remove the outer 5-stick wrappers, and replace all the sticks back into the pack. Either the packs have a manufacturing defect, or, more likely, the 10 pack package was stored at elevated temperatures before shipping. I have purchased individual packs at local stores for a long time and never had this problem. I will have to try a different vendor on the next order.

I bought a case of Juanita's pozole (some pork, some chicken) to stash in my cellar as 'emergency rations' after the 1989 earthquake near San Francisco, and I finally opened a can of it at a campsite on Labor Day. Of course you can't just gobble it as it pours from the can; it needs the traditional fresh condiments: chopped onion, oregano (dried or fresh), chopped green chilis, red chili flakes, and lime juice. And then it's close to delicious. The can holds enough for two good portions.<br />This price is a few cents higher than what it costs in most ethnic corner groceries, and shipping makes it quite a lot higher. If there isn't an ethnic corner grocery that would carry such a product in your neighborhood, I have one piece of advice: Move!

review/summary: Oh YES
review/text: I read about these on a blog and Oh my god they are so good! My only complaint is the amount of cola flavor because its my favorite, Ships fast and gets wherever its going without being broken. I will be buying more of these.

review/summary: Actually Pretty Decent!
review/text: I know that title sounds a big negative, but you have to know that I wasn't expecting much. Being only 1 WW Points+ each, I was expecting overly sweet, not very chocolatey and not very tasty. I was wrong, though!<br /><br />These are a decent size; one mouthful, or 2 smaller bites. Each is individually wrapped, which makes them perfect to stick in a lunch or snack box for work. They certainly stop my chocolate or sweet craving after meals or between 2-4 pm.

review/summary: Simply Orgasmic!
review/text: Gentlemen's Reslish is a climactic experience. I love to apply a thin layer to a nice hot shnitzel. I just rub it on there, and let the flavors explode.<br />I only have one complaint:<br />Don't let Gentlemen's Relish flail around. It burns if you get it in your eye!

review/summary: Amazing for the few who will enjoy it
review/text: The smell you first get from opening this container is pungent and will make u go 'wtf'. Once spread on buttered toast, is a whole different story. Its deep nutty, fishy flavor is very umami. Don't use too much.

review/summary: Puppy love's them!
review/text: My Australian Shepherd puppy loves these things! I was looking for chew treats made specifically for puppies, to avoid giving him something that would harm him, so I purchased these and have been giving them to him since he was about 8 weeks old. They keep him occupied for a solid 30 minutes or so, the only problem with them is that they leave an orangy trail on your carpet and, if your puppy is like mine and uses his paws to hold while he chews, they inevitably get it all over their paws too :-( It's not hard to wash out, just a pain and seems kind of silly to have a dog treat that bleeds orange everywhere if you have neutral colored carpet like me.

review/summary: Nylabone Happy Time Puppy Chews
review/text: I know it says they are long lasting but my two toy breed puppies made them disappear almost immediately. I would hate to see what a larger puppy could have done with them. Not so long lasting but they LOVED them! I am looking for a longer lasting treat to keep them busy in the morning when I crate them and leave for work. Any recommendations?
