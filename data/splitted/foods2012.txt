review/summary: Delicious vegetarian chili
review/text: This vegetarian chili is BOMB.  As someone who recently started eating less meat, let me say, you will NOT miss it with Stagg vegetable garden chili.  It is rich and hearty (unlike some other vegetarian chilis I have tried, which are tomato-y or pasty).  Plus, the ones I got have a pull-top, so you don't even need a can opener.  Whether you're going camping or just want a quick and tasty lunch, this chili will not disappoint.  Delicious way to get your vegetables.  My only complaint is that it's a 15, rather than 16, oz can.

review/summary: Acceptable, not great. Stagg has better stuff
review/text: It's canned vegetable chili. If you're hungry, eat it. It wasn't worth going out of my way to get it. It has a burnt flavor to it that is sort of unappealing, and is the only note that really stands out in what is a rather bland chili. I was really disappointed, since other flavors of Stagg chili are surprisingly good. My favorite is the steakhouse chili which is generally available from Costco. A little on the spicy side with nice chunks of meat and a very satisfying chili overall. That isn't the case with the vegetable chili.

review/text: I really wanted to love this product, but the chili was way sweeter than any chili I've ever eaten, and the consistency seemed artificially thickened. With a lot of salsa added, it was okay, but I won't be ordering this again. Wish there had been a nutrition label to view before ordering, because the sodium level was high along with the sugar. Worst of both worlds.

review/summary: Great deal!
review/text: Peppercorns were as dry as it should be but a little dusty with a very slight amount of small twigs.  As soon as I received it, emptied it onto a flat pan, cleaned out the unwanted material and hand-transferred (to separate the dust) to one of those 'dill pickle' gallon bottles - and still had half of a coffee bottle left over for immediate uses - and stored the 'big one' in the freezer (since 5lbs is going to last me couple of years - refrigerator will do as well if you have the space, if frozen you may want to bring it to room temperature before grinding).  The reason I bought this 5 pounder was when I did some simple calculation noticed it was getting pricey in smaller quantities, so I thought, as it is a dried item why don't I buy in bulk and store it away from heat and moisture (to avoid any kind of fungus/mold formation) and enjoy the savings - paid essentially only half the price compared to buying in small bottles/packages.  Hope this helps..

review/text: My daughter loves this Raspberry hot cocoa mix.  At one time, we were able to purchase it from Sams in a package with other flavors of hot cocoa mixes.  However, this year (2010/2011) the Raspberry was not available in the multi-pack of cocoa mixes.  Our local grocery store carries other flavors of this cocoa mix and they are sold individually; however, the Raspberry is not available.  So on the search I went to find this particular flavor of cocoa mix.  Of course, Amazon is the place to look and purchase.

review/summary: My french bulldog's favorite food thus far
review/text: We adopted our frenchie from the shelter about 7 months ago. She was 2-3 years old and not knowing anything about her history we just picked a random food and thought we'd experiment until she decided what she and her digestive track liked best. After several other brands including Blue Wilderness, Premium Edge, and Pinnacle, the search is over. Not only is Hi-Tek lamb & sweet potato her favorite (she has always scarfed down food, but this is scarfed down with a vengeance), but it seems to settle well in the sense that while on this food she has consistent and solid number twos unlike some of the others which have given her intermittent diarrhea.<br />With my previous dogs I had always been an Iams fan, in fact our 2 English bulldogs lived to be 14 eating nothing but Iams. But with the frenchie we decided to go grain-free, one because it's just healthier and two because she did have ear infections when we got her (I read that grain allergies can be manifested this way). She's been ear-infection free since about the first month, has a healthy coat and tons of energy which may be attributed in part to her grain-free diet in general rather than any particular food. Yes trying 4 brands over 7 months might seem silly but we did slowly blend them to transition her each time, and gave ample time to monitor how she did on each. Happy to have found a winner, Hi-Tek lamb & sweet potato.<br />Thanks Amazon for offering this product at a decent price with fast and free shipping, I'll continue to buy it here for those reasons.

review/text: Remember when American candy makers used real chocolate?  (Yeah, I guess that makes me old.)  Real chocolate.  Not chocolate flavored candy product or whatever they call it.  This isn't bitter chocolate.  Between the candy shell and the actual chocolate, it is the perfect sweetness.<br /><br />So, now I have this addition.  I've convinced myself that these things hold a prominent position on the food chart, pyramid, and plate, (whatever lovely concept they are using now).  Green M&M's are vegetables, orange and yellow are fruits.  Blue and red?  Heck, they have peanuts in them and peanuts are good for you!<br /><br />I buy in bulk under the guise of sharing with my coworkers.  (Who am I fooling?  I don't even like those people.)  They come to my desk with their grubby little hands outstretched.  They leave with a few bits of yumminess, happy as a lark.  Me?  I'm seething on the inside. That's eight fewer M&M's that I will get to enjoy.  Then I rejoice.  After all, they are leaving my office and I have another bag stashed away.

review/summary: DEEEEEElicious!  My new favorite sweetener
review/text: I've tried several brands of Xylitol and only disliked one ("Ideal") because it contained other ingredients. This brand does not. The granules are sugar sized and it tastes like sugar and can be used like sugar. I even put it in my coffee bean grinder to see if I could turn it into powdered sugar and it worked (very quickly) and was delicious. The down side is that it became very hard a couple days later, but that may happen with regular sugar too...I know that powdered sugar is sugar plus an ingredient to keep it "powdery" so this shouldn't be held against Xylitol.<br /><br />Several things worth knowing about Xylitol:<br /><br />1. It is very hard to tell the difference between Xylitol and sugar, both by the way it looks and the way it tastes. The only real difference is that it has a cooling effect on your tongue, rather like mint. It tastes like sugar on your tongue but I've found when cooking/baking with it, it takes a little bit extra (maybe 10%) to achieve the same sweetness. Also, it doesn't caramelize when heated. Xylitol definitely does not have a chemical taste to it like other sweeteners, which makes sense because it's not a synthesized product like other sweeteners. I far prefer it because I don't expect to hear about discoveries in ten or twenty years from now that it causes cancer or tumors.<br /><br />2. If you want an artificial sweetener for diet purposes and don't care about chemicals, this probably isn't your best bet.  It has fewer calories than sugar by about 40% but the artificial sweeteners have fewer calories. (I personally think chemicals are far more hazardous than calories, but to each his own!)<br /><br />3. It kills harmful bacteria. A great use for this is dental care (you'll find it as an ingredient in many mouthwashes, toothpastes, and gum) and it works very well. I dip my toothpasted toothbrush into Xylitol sometimes when my mouth hasn't been feeling clean and after brushing my teeth, they feel smooth like after a dentist visit. Possibly the slightly abrasive effect of brushing with crystals has something to do with it but my mouth also feels pretty clean after drinking hot cocoa made with Xylitol and that's not the case when I make it with sugar. I use Xylitol because I have Candida and I can use the help killing it!<br /><br />4. It is known to soften the stool and I have personally found this to be true. I told a friend about it and he now eats Xylitol specifically for this purpose, something I hadn't thought of. So one person's downside is another person's upside! I don't know if this is a universal effect but I would recommend keeping your intake small (a tablespoon or less) for a few days to see how it impacts your system. I baked a cake with it and didn't have a problem (and ate probably 1/4 cup of Xylitol that day) but I'm not sure if that was attributable to the baking or some other reason, perhaps the softening effect is achieved with a small amount and larger amounts don't increase it.

review/summary: A great product, but it is DEADLY to dogs and people need to be careful with it!!!
review/text: I personally love Xylitol - I have no digestive ill effects from it at all, though I do from many other sugar alcohols. I think a lot of that depends on your own personal body chemistry, so if you need a sugar replacement you should try a lot of small amounts of the different sugar alcohols. For me, maltitol and sorbitol are awful, but xylitol is just fine. Of all the sugar replacements I have tried, I think xylitol tastes the most like sugar. It has a nice, grainy texture like sugar does, which makes it appealing for applications like sprinkling it on fruit, and it isn't overly-sweet the way I find most sugar replacements are. If anything, I would say measure for measure it is slightly less sweet than sugar, which I actually like as I'm trying to reduce my sweet tooth in general.<br /><br />HOWEVER, EVERYONE WHO OWNS A DOG NEEDS TO BE AWARE THAT XYLITOL IS DEADLY TO DOGS. I am not some weirdo posting rumors - please google xylitol dogs and the very first entry is from Snopes.com stating that this is true. As little as 3 grams can kill a 65 pound dog.<br /><br />I still use XyloSweet all the time; I am just very, very careful when I use it when my dog is around because he's a floor-licking sort of guy. And while I never give him people-food, I know others often do and you obviously can't do that with anything you've made with Xylitol.<br /><br />Please, please upvote this review if you can - I'm concerned that no warning appears on the bag or in the company's copy and that none of the highly-voted reviews discuss this issue. It is very easy to prevent what could be a deadly accident for your dog!

review/summary: 5lb bag is very small, tastes great, bad digestive "issues"
review/text: Anyone with common sense would probably figure out that a 5lb bag of Xylitol would be smaller than a 5lb bag of Splenda.  However, I was actually surprised when it arrived.  It was about 2/3 the size of a 5lb bag of sugar!  So, I guess Xylitol weighs more than sugar, which makes it really, really, really expensive, instead of just really expensive.<br /><br />This stuff tastes great and really does not have an aftertaste.  I had been using Splenda, but wanted to get away from using artificial sweeteners.  However, a huge drawback is the digestive problems I get every time I use Xylitol.  I started out by just using a tsp/day in my coffee and thought I'd be able to work up to more.  Nope, every time I try to use more, I spend the day in the bathroom.  Literally, all day.  Gross, but you need to know what this stuff will do to you!  The good news is that it will last a long time since I can only consume a tsp/day.

review/summary: Buy American birch, not Chinese corn cob extract
review/text: There are two mainstream commercial sources of Xylitol - Corn and Hardwood trees such as Birch. Many rumors have circulated on the internet regarding the benefits and or drawbacks of either. Here you can gather the facts.<br /><br />The structure of Xylitol does not differ between corn based and birch based xylitol. However, it is a fact that the vast majority of corn based Xylitol found in North America is imported from China. Almost all imported Chinese Xylitol is derived from corn.<br /><br />Also a fact is that most commercial sources of corn itself are genetically modified. This is not true of birch trees.<br /><br />The process utilized in making birch based Xylitol is envirnmentally green and sustainable, in fact the process often uses caommercial scrap that may otherwise be discarded.<br /><br />So is Birch better than corn? You be the judge, each individual can make up their mind. Prices are almost the same, if the description doesn't say American birch you can assume it's Chinese corn.

review/summary: Tastes fantastic but there is a downside
review/text: There is nothing negative I can say about the taste.  Xylitol tastes as good as sugar and there's no after taste.  But it can cause cramping and diarrhea if you eat a lot of it.  Your body can adjust to it - up to a point.  So you're better off starting with small amounts at first and working your way up to figure out how you respond to it.  I started having awful cramps after a couple days from just putting a teaspoon in my morning coffee, 3 cups.

I gave it 2 tries, tapering off after the first time. The second time just felt stomach roiling. Still, not exactly a wanted result. The taste of the product was fine, for what it's worth. Unlike Splenda and other Splenda knock-offs, this has crystalized granuals that take a bit to disolve, not unlike sugar.

My take is that it was worth the try but it neither is worth it nor does it replaces sugar.

review/summary: The best natural sweetener ever!
review/text: XyloSweet is closer to sugar than any other sweetener out there and it is actually healthy. It has a similar consistency, though the granules are just a bit larger. It's very close in sweetness. I agree with the review that said you might need about 10% more to achieve the same sweetness.<br /><br />It's "good" for your teeth, providing healthy bacteria.<br /><br />It doesn't leave a strange aftertaste (one my favorite things about it). It does have a bit of a cooling effect on the tongue, which I don't mind at all.<br /><br />It's not artificial, so no cancer . . . and that's a plus (putting it lightly!). I haven't used poisonous artificial sweeteners in years. Well really not ever, because I never could stand the taste . . . but before I knew how hazardous they were to my health I allowed them sometimes out of desperation to lose weight. Turns out they actually help CAUSE weight gain. Wow.<br /><br />By the way, I have read reviews where people mention Splenda. One reviewer bakes with half XyloSweet and half Splenda. DON'T CONSUME SPLENDA! It is not all natural and healthy as it is touted to be. (Read about it at drmercola.com)<br /><br />WARNING: XyloSweet CAN give some people digestive problems. I don't have any trouble with it, but some people do. Start with small amounts and see how it affects your bowel movements. Some people use it specifically to HELP with bowl movements, but some have to avoid it. Based on the number of good reviews, I think more people are fine with it than are not.<br /><br />As a sufferer of Candida (yeast overgrowth), XyloSweet has become my new best friend. ;)

review/text: I really like the flavor of this sweetener as it is sweet like sugar but has no bitter aftertaste like stevia. This was the cheapest value I could find without buying 20 lbs, but I wish I could find this cheaper so I could use it for baking. I know this is good for the teeth, but I am still trying to research what health effect, if any, it has when consuming a lot of it such as would be used in baking. One drawback is that it literally took weeks for this item to be shipped to me. I have Amazon 2 day shipping, and all my other items in the order came within 2 days but this product took weeks. I am assuming there was some problem with the supplier.

It's a corn product, soo...<br /><br />Xylosweet is not quite as sweet as sugar, so you need a little bit more, and then well, guess what happens?  I haven't actually baked with it (like a cup or more) cause I've been too scared.  Maybe baking elimates that effect.  I'll let someone else try first.<br /><br />NOW foods makes a xylitol mixed with stevia packet, to carry in your purse.  The little bit of xylitol added to the stevia, takes away a bit of that stevia yucky bitter taste.  A bit.  Still, that's all I can use, so...that's what I do.

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody and Xylitol is toxic to pets.  Maltitol and Xylitol are alcohol sugars and can be undigestible in the body. You will know a short time after consuming any alcohol sugar if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use some or all of the alcohol sugars to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol or the xylitol or the mannitol or the sorbitol! I had to give up Xylitol because I broke out in a rash of little white bumps in my mouth... who knew!

review/text: I know "Sweet Potato and Chicken" sounds very appealing (I wouldn't mind having that for dinner, myself), but if you're trying to look out for your allergic pet, please remember that quite a few dogs that are sensitive to grains and gluten are also allergic to chicken. As long as you're switching to a "Limited Ingredient Diet" (L.I.D.), you should really consider buying a product that uses a different protein source - like turkey, fish, lamb, duck, or bison. And be sure to watch out for "chicken fat" in the list of ingredients (a hidden source of the problematic protein).<br />Also, the Dog Food Advisor website is a wonderful resource if you're interested in purchasing quality pet food for your companion. It rates every dog food on the market, and tells you what's right/wrong with it. The website has helped me make much better decisions on behalf of my 4-legged family members.

I have two Pomeranians and they LOVE this stuff.  One of them is really greedy and the other one is finicky.  Before I began feeding them the Sweet Potato & Chicken Formula, I was purchasing the original formula.  They seemed to like that one enough.  I don't recall why I first bought this food for them... it could have been because one is so picky, but they scarfed it down from day one. I have experienced no issues with them having any digestive issues, their coats are nice and shiny, and their eyes are bright. They like this food so much, that I don't dare buy another formula, for fear that I would waste a bag if they didn't like it.  Even though it is harder to find and more expensive than the original formula, I will continue to purchase this food for them because they love it so much and they are healthy and happy.

review/summary: the only dry popcorn seasoning I like
review/text: Of all the popcorn seasonings I've tried, this is the best.  I love buttered popcorn, but was looking for a healthy snack.  This fit the bill and tastes good.  All of my kids love it, too.  We also tried other whirley-pop seasonings (their popper is fantastic by the way!), but none matched up.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Thought this was like the seasoning they have in the local theater her.  Wrong.  Just not very good tasting overall.  Compared it with Kroger brand here at the Ralphs market, and Kroger is much better for less money.  Live and learn.  By the way, I went back to the theater and noted the brand they use, it's "Kernel Seasons".  That's the best.

review/summary: A Rip-Off
review/text: I love Manuka Honey and use it for many purposes. I was on vacation last week and forgot to bring my jar of ApiHealth Active Manuka Honey with me. So I went onto Amazon from my iPhone and found one that I could have shipped quickly on my Amazon Prime account - which was the "Manuka Health New Zealand Active MGO 550+".  The price at $55 is the going rate (albeit expensive) so I didn't give that a thought when I ordered it....but...what I didn't notice is that it's only 250 grams and the high quality active Manuka honey for which the going rate is $55 is for 500 grams!!!  So, for a product that is already too expensive, they're selling HALF THE SIZE for the same price, making it OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE.  In addition, when I got home, I checked on the AMHA (Active Manuka Honey Assoc) web site and Manuka Health New Zealand is not a licensee. Nor do they use the UMF standard, therefore, there is no way to verify the quality or the true Activity Level of the Manuka Honey in the jar.<br /><br />It tastes fine but it does not have the delicious taste of ApiHealth or Watson and Son or Spirits Bay, all of which are excellent.  This one is obviously Manuka, but there is also a bit of the taste of regular honey, which is an entirely different flavor.<br /><br />If this jar were the standard size of 500g, at this pricing level, it would have cost $110!!!! Don't get me wrong, they didn't lie - the site specifically says 250g - but without the other jar in front of me, that size didn't mean anything to me and given that the price is the same as what others charge for twice as much, it never occurred to me when I ordered it that this was such a rip off.

review/summary: this product is pricy but well worth it
review/text: I have had stomach ulcers my entire life. I have taken this product and my pain and suffering really have been reduced big time. I also watch what I eat and I took a tsp of this a day. it does work and I am very happy with it. I am adding more to this. with the proper diet and with cutting out soda and greece for about two months and take this product about three times a day my ulcers and acid reflex are gone. I can eat spicy food again and drink soda just fine. this product does help to get rid of ulcers and acid reflex and is cheeper then buying over the counter prilosec or zantac or other things that give you enough pills for a week but cost over twenty dollars a box for a weak of relief. with this honey it took a month a tsp a day for a month and I have not had any reaccuring pains. I have been pain free now for over a year. Its natural it tastes good and is good for you. Doctors dont make money on this product so they dont tell you about it.

review/text: This candy is amazing! I'm a BIG tea fan. Iced, hot, green, black, whatever kinda tea it is, i like it. The classic iced tea tastes just like what it says... classic iced tea. The citrus is like if you were to squeeze a lemon into a glass of tea. The green tea latte is a bit strange. It tastes a lot like caramel, but also has a tea flavor to it. Its good as well. Also the shipping was great. I ordered it on a Friday and got it the next Monday. Overall, some of the greatest hard candy i've ever tried, and by far, the best tea candy.

review/summary: Great way to try all three flavors...
review/text: This little 3-pack assortment is a great way to try all three flavors of Bali's Best Tea Candy. Previously, I had purchased a single pack of the Citrus Green Tea, from a specialty shop. It was so incredible... I wish I had bought about 10 packs of it.<br /><br />Upon reading reviews, I thought the Classic Iced Tea might be to my liking as well. I am not a big fan of green tea latte, but thought that I should give it a try, since other people raved about it so much. I was right. The Green Tea Latte was my least favorite of the three. It reminded me a little of green tea ice cream. Okay once in a while, but not an every day treat for me. I prefer the crisp/clear taste, over the creamy/milky flavor. Just personal preference.<br /><br />Now, I simply cannot decide which of the other 2 flavors I love more. They are so incredible tasting, and smooth textured. I love both the astringency and the acidity. They are perfectly balanced, and the flavors play like a melody on the palate. If I could, I would order a case of each of them... just so I could have them on hand all the time. They are by far, my favorite candy, bar none. No pun intended.  :)<br /><br />*Note to sellers, I refuse to pay $5 or $6 shipping on a single $1.99 bag of candy. This is absolutely ludicrous. Get real! Before doing that, I will buy a case of 12 packs from a vendor offering free shipping.

review/summary: Flaked barley looks like oatmeal and cooks up similarly
review/text: I have a son who just can't tolerate oats. He isn't gluten-intolerant (according to the trials I've done at home), but, from infancy, has reacted with eczema flares every time I tried introducing oatmeal. (Ironic, since so many skin creams for eczema include the "soothing" ingredient oatmeal!)<br /><br />At our private (Waldorf) school, as at many others, they serve oatmeal for snack once a week. This wasn't going to work for my little boy, and I started out sending in a thermos for him each week with a hot cereal I had prepared at home, but that can get tricky and inconvenient on a busy school-day morning. His teacher said they could cook something additional at school for him, and I finally sent in a package of these Bob's Red Mill barley flakes for them to prepare for him.<br /><br />In my experience, cooking these flakes is pretty similar to making rolled oats. I often use my rice cooker (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007J5U7">Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 5-1/2-Cup (Uncooked) Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker and Warmer, Premium White</a>) and its porridge cycle to prepare hot cereals for breakfast at home, including this type. While I more often blend leftover rice with barley for our morning meals, my son's kindergarten teacher is cooking these barley flakes by themselves per the package instructions for his school snack every week, and she thinks it is a wonderful solution to our situation.<br /><br />I actually love oatmeal (as does my other son), so I do always find it a bit of a jolt when I eat barley flakes because it APPEARS to similar to rolled oats but tastes rather different. I do like the taste, actually, but I would definitely warn a kid who expected oatmeal before substituting barley based upon my personal reaction to the difference. We top rolled barley with brown sugar and maple syrup, just exactly the way we serve rolled oats. My child who can eat both oats and barley does like both, but he also notices the different tastes.<br /><br />As a mom, I would definitely recommend trying rolled barley as just another breakfast cereal for any family who enjoys hot cereal. It is great to have options aside from the more expected oats. And, especially for those with sensitivities, this is a good oat alternative. I do like many Bob's Red Mill products, and would consider them a brand I trust.

review/summary: Cinnamon better than any found on any food store shelf .
review/text: Best cinnamon I have found and used in over 45 years of Baking.<br />I am a repeat customer for this Frontier Cinnamon Powder (Korintje / A Grade (3% oil).<br />On my first order, I found reviews stating the 3% Oil  was a much stronger flavor and aroma than normal cinnamon (Such as McCormick's), and others just CAN"T COMPARE. AND that the Korintje cinnamon was equivalent to cinnamon so popular from CINNABUNS.<br />I have won several ribbons for my baking, and have had some of my receipes published. I now have reqular orders and some special orders from customers that consider my Carrot Cake among the best. I give some of that credit to the use of this cinnamon in my carrot CAKE receipe, and my husband "RAVES" for my STICKY BUNS with pecans. I first considered and tried using less of the cinnamon, than originally called for in my receipes. (And that works well, and makes for less cost for the receipe). But I have found (including suggestion from my husband) that using the same amount as originally called for in the recipes, just ADDS to the flavor and robust aroma of the baked goods.

review/summary: Definitely high quality cinnamon
review/text: This Korintje Cinnamon tastes much more vibrant and has the sharp sting of cinnamon, similar to Big Red (chewing gum). This type of cinnamon would be great for desserts, such as the Korean Soo Chung Gwa (Cinnamon drink), but I would not recommend it for non-bakery foods. Because it is so fragrant with a sharp cinnamon sting, I think that using it in sauces for meats might make it too overpowering. It is excellent for bakeries and cinnamon rolls though!<br />I also made some Gingerbread Cake and the Korintje cinnamon is what made mine tastes just like the Whole Foods Market's famous gingerbread sold at their bakeries. When compared to McCormick's cinnamon, I could taste a significant difference. McCormick's tastes more flat and dull, which may be good for meat or recipes where you want only a light cinnamon flavor (like Pho). Frontier's Korintje cinnamon tastes sharp and stingy, with a strong fragrance.

I couldn't imagine them topping the original, but they did with these crackers.<br /><br />My favorite type of cheese is cheddar, so it actually makes sense that I would love these.  They have a very strong, sharp cheddar flavor.  It doesn't taste artificial at all, but tastes like the cheddar I buy for my sandwiches.  I can sit down and eat a box all by myself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they have lots of calories.  25 crackers contain 150 calories, almost half of which are from fat.  So, while I can eat an entire box, I try to pace myself.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy Cheez-Its.  But if I have a choice, I go for these any day of the week.

review/summary: Absolutely lovely!
review/text: Same as Tate & Lyle's in the tin, but so much easier to use for smaller things! Price is a little much for the size of the bottle, which is why it gets 4 of 5 stars, but it is definitely tasty!

review/summary: Awesome tea
review/text: Really good tea. I used to buy darjeeling in Indian store, but this one is much more better. Use a teapod and wait 5 minutes before you drink it.

review/summary: Darjeeling surprise from Amazon
review/text: A good Darjeeling is hard to find.  I have been disappointed by many products.  This SerendipiTea Darjeeling has a fine fragrance, smooth body, and clean, earthy taste.<br /><br />The paper box it comes in is an additional treat:  no cans or big plastic container to deal with.<br /><br />Wonderful, thank you!

review/summary: Best tasting Natural Artesian Water !
review/text: I am a water connoisseur,and tried three bottled waters this weekend.  Danasi from the pepsi company, Aquafina from the coca cola company and Jana from a Gorgeous country called Croatia on the Dalmatian coast.  Jana water was superb in taste in comparison to the others.  It felt smooth on the tounge, and It felt refreshing and pure.  There was a pleasant, clean smell, and I felt instantly refreshed upon drinking it !  Therefore I give it five stars and will order many more.  This is a high quality product at a good price !
