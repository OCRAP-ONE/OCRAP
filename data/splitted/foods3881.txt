review/text: I just recently got a Keurig coffee maker & registered it online.  Keurig sent me a coupon for buy 2 boxes, get 2 free.  Awhile back, a local bagel shop had a coconut coffee that I fell in love with.  So, I decided to try this coffee out because it has coconut in it.  I brewed my first cup this morning & it smelled VERY strong of coconut so of COURSE I couldn't wait to try it.  After it cooled down a bit I took my first sip.  AMAZING!!  It is quite delightful & I STRONGLY recommend it if you like coconut coffee.  No bitter aftertaste, either & no soot @ the bottom of my cup.  Awesome

review/text: I have at least 4 dozen different k-cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors.  My favorite is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso because I like a bold coffee.  But others that prefer something milder say that Breakfast in Bed is their favorite.  I like it to but only when made as a stronger brew.  I have purchased maybe 15 boxes of this since it came out.

review/summary: Superb coffee
review/text: I'm actually suprised from reading some of the rants about this coffee.  I have tried 20+ K-cup varieties and this is by far my favorite.  Contrary to some reviews, I don't find it to be weak at all and in fact, is quite bold but with absolutely not hints of being bitter.  Very smooth and leaves a great aftertaste.  I prefer really strong coffee and this is a good compromise for a medium roast as it's not as bold as I would normally prefer but certainly strong enough to satisfy my preferences.<br /><br />I typically drink Wolfgang's Jamaica Me Crazy but ever since trying Rodeo Drive, I haven't gone back.

review/text: I Recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at Bed Bath and Beyond. As its brewing, it smells great (if you like coconut).  The taste isn't bad, but for me, it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have. I gave it 3 stars because it's not terrible. But I wouldn't buy this coffee again. If you're sensitive to after taste, I wouldn't recommend. I'd Grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee.

review/text: I am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when I bought the sampler pack of Jamaica Me Crazy I honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee.  The aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere.  The flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all.  A great new addition to my coffee line up.

Wolfgang Puck has the name and the rep.<br /><br />If this were the only Sumatra dark roast on the market, I'd be really happy with it. This is good coffee.<br /><br />It is not outstanding coffee. Compared to Folgers, this product is awesome. Unfortunately for Mr. Puck, I am comparing it to Green Mountain Sumatra.<br /><br />The organic and free trade Sumatra from Green Mountain is better to my taste, and it is cheaper. Mornings are good.

review/summary: I really like this one!
review/text: Taste is a personal thing, isn't it.  So I'll just tell you(as a gauge) my all time favorite K-cup is Timothy's Midnight Magic a "california roast" (which is dark). I'm partial to dark roasts and probably would not have even bothered with this Sorrento, but a friend had it, so I tried it, and lo and behold - I'm very glad I did. I find this blend even better than Puck's "Kopei Ray" which is his dark roast. There's a whole lot of good flavor here - the word "luscious" comes to mind. This one's not available every where and comes at a slight cost premium. I say it's worth it. These will be a regular for me. PS: A suggestion (which seems apparent); as with any k-cup, when you try a new blend, use the plain old 1 cup setting to check it out undiluted the first time.

review/summary: Not my favorite, but it came in second
review/text: My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. Wolfgang Puck was my second favorite. So far, I like Folgers the best.<br /><br />FOLGERS GOURMET<br />SELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIAN<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)<br />Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.<br /><br />WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROAST<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)<br />A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burnt<br />and papery flavors.<br /><br />TIMOTHY'S DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUM<br />Price per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)<br />A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Excellent smooth, light coffee.  Good anytime.
review/text: Definately not what I'd expected with the Wolfgang Puck name on it.  To me, Wolfgang Puck has conotations of a heavy, dark-roast European-style coffee.  I thought I'd already found my perfect coffee in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GV68">Timothy's World Coffee, Breakfast Blend for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> but this one edges it out.  Smooth and balanced it really is great from the first sip till the last drop.<br /><br />There will never be a coffee that all coffee lovers will agree on but if you like a light-medium roast, give the Breakfast in Bed blend a try.  Very low in acidity, someone who can't tolerate the acidity in coffee may be able to enjoy this blend.  But, be aware and contrary to popular belief, light roast coffee is typically higher in caffine than the dark roast coffees, the extended roasting to produce a dark roast burns away some of the caffine. This one will definately get you going in the morning in a good way.<br /><br />Those who prefer a dark roast or extra bold should probably look elsewhere.

review/text: Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I can't remember when I've had a cup of coffee so delicious, I immediately wanted another cup.  There is no bitter taste, no funny chemical taste you get with so many flavored coffees, no odd aftertaste.  It's just a mellow, gorgeous, hazelnut-with-a-touch-of-the-islands cup of coffee.  Outstanding.  My favorite I've ever tried, and I've tried most!

review/text: This is very good coffee, but it doesn't have as much flavor as the Van Houttes creme caramel.  If your looking for something that has a lot of flavor, go with the other.  If you are looking for something that is more coffee than flavor, this is it.

review/text: By far,this is the best flavored K cup coffee I've ever had. Good body, not bitter, no flowery aroma (like with the Green Mountain flavored K cups). I like my coffee a little stronger than Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut, but it is certainly a fine, medium bodied,coffee I could drink over and over.

review/summary: Mmm, mm, great coffee aroma!
review/text: While looking for a top rated vanilla K-cup, I stumbled upon this combination flavored cup that was rated higher than any of the vanilla flavored cups at that time.  I took a chance and ordered a double pack from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised. This is a rich tasting medium/light roasted flavor that appeals to several coffee drinkers at our house. There is a hint of built in sweetness so that additional sweeteners are not necessary for those of us who don't care for super sweet coffee. I would classify this as a medium roast and tastes best with the medium sized cup selections on our Keurig Coffee Brewer<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a>. People who prefer extra bold coffees would need to use two of these K-cups to make one extra large travel mug of coffee.<br />  That said, we have found that mixing this flavor with other flavors to make an extra large serving is a most enjoyable pastime at our house. The most popular combo's so far are Jamaica me Crazy with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00395DVQS">Van Houtte French Vanilla K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, Hazlenut<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00395574M">Van Houtte Hazelnut Decaffeinated K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> or Costa Rican<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ4I">Van Houtte Caf&eacute;, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>. In the end, This is one of the most versatile flavors for those of us who have frequent visitors and several palettes to please.

review/text: First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.

review/text: I have tried many brands of medium roast coffees however, this is my favorite. Some I've tried are bitter; some are too light; some are too strong; but this one for me is just right! Some brands more than others come in all puffed up and when punctured, the grounds filter out into the needle of the Keurig coffee maker and has to be cleaned which isn't difficult, just annoying. Never had a problem with these.  Breakfast in Bed k-cups are smooth, not too light and not too strong, right smack in the midddle. No bitter after taste either and perfect any time of day. Enjoy!

I'm not some crazy "gotta have my jet black sludge to get<br />through the day" coffee drinker - I'd say my favorite (and my wife's) is<br />Caribou Blend.  This blend is WEAK, it can't hold half-and-half or even<br />just whole milk without being wiped out.  Now, I will say I brew it on<br />the "large cup" (9.25 oz, I believe) setting on our Keurig, so maybe it's<br />a bit better on the 8oz setting, or even the small setting.  But Caribou (we<br />also like Donut Shop, Green Mountain Kona Blend 10%, etc.) can be easily<br />brewed on 9.25 and hold a good bold taste.  This coffee doesn't<br />hold a CANDLE to any of those.  Now I'm stuck with 40+ of these. Blech...maybe<br />the guests won't mind it! :)

review/summary: Not Bad! Smooth, Not Bitter, Plenty Strong But Not Too Strong.
review/text: NOTE: This one is better for me at the smallest cup setting, which makes it stronger.<br /><br />This is my first time to try Wolfgang Puck coffee. I have mixed feelings about it so far. The Rodeo Drive Blend is a little more 'bland' than I'm used to, which is great for people who prefer that. It's just a different taste, which is good or not-so-good, depending on each person's preference. Personally, ever so often I take a sip of Rodeo Drive Blend and think that it almost tasted like dishwater. Then that goes away and I enjoy the rest of the cup of coffee. I think that reaction is because it isn't as strong and bold as I'm used to, but it's pretty good. I can see that some people might make this their favorite because it is different.<br /><br />Will I buy this again? No. It's good, but it's not my preference, and I might as well buy the ones that make me rave on and on about how good they are, usually Tully's French, Kona, Italian, and House. Those may be too strong for some people, and the Rodeo Drive Blend does have its own unique taste which may really appeal to some coffee drinkers. As with most things, actually a little more than in most things, with coffee, it's a matter of taste and probably a matter of what you are in the habit of drinking. You may want to try this one, especially if you can find it in a sample packet, or do like I do, keep the rest for guests to try.

review/text: This is my favorite so far amongst the Wolfgang Puck K-Cups. The word that comes to mind when i sip it is "Bright". It has a natural sweetness and good flavor, without being overly heavy. The packaging lists it as a Medium Roast, but i'd put it more towards the light end of the spectrum. It's a very enjoyable cup, and i'd recommend if you are looking for something to switch up with Green Mountian's popular Vermont Country Blend or Breakfast Blend.<br /><br />I generally haven't been impressed with the Wolfgang Puck flavored varieties (Vanilla Francaie, Jamaica me Crazy), but this regular cup is quite good.

review/text: This coffee was not what I expected but enjoyed it greatly.  I was looking for a stronger vanilla flavor but after trying it I enjoyed it a lot. It was light and smooth and left no aftertaste.  I would recommend this to others.

review/summary: A bolder Columbian
review/text: I like Columbian coffee and this is above average with a good dark color with a nice smell.  The taste is bolder than average but not unpleasant or bitter.  This is my "strong" Columbian coffee combining all the good things of the type with a bolder taste.

review/summary: Above average K-cup coffee
review/text: We have a Keurig coffee maker. One of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different K-cups. I have already tried half a score. Some seem pretty tasty at first--until one taste something that is even better. Some early K-cups that I graded highly don't compare too well with later brands that I have tried.<br /><br />Wolfgang Puck's Columbian Dark Roast Noir is one of the better products that I have tried. It has a bold taste, although not strongly so. It is also smooth tasting.<br /><br />It is now on my short list of possibilities for my first morning cup of coffee. So, I am pretty happy with Wolfgang Puck's product here.

review/summary: Nice rich flavor, good cup of coffee
review/text: We've only been using the k-cups about 2 months.  Both my wife and I like our coffee bold.  I've been guided by amazon reviews and started out with Coffee People's Jet Fuel.  Although that is still my favorite, I got this French Roast on a Friday sale and would say that it's my new second choice.  I have also tried Coffee People's Black Tiger (a close third) and Kona (not a fan).  This is a nice, well-rounded every-day cup, more on the bold side but not wincingly so.

review/summary: Good flavor, but bad pod quality
review/text: The flavor of this coffee is good, it has a nice balance of Vanilla without being too strong.  It's not the boldest coffee, but it's a nice afternoon treat.<br /><br />That being said, I have had problems with several pods.  When you hold them up to the light, you can see that there are grounds outside of the filter portion of the pod.  This causes a cup full of grounds when you brew the coffee, and also clogs up the pin at the bottom of the pod chamber.  I'd say about 1 out of every 5 or 6 pods has this problem.

review/summary: Grounds for not ordering again
review/text: I love the taste of this coffee but in my last order of four boxes about every other K-cup has a tear or rip in the internal filter and thus the grounds flow through into the cup of coffee which wastes the value of the coffee as drinkable.  Wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging.  I will not order again because of the waste.

review/summary: Not as sweet as other French Vanilla coffees
review/text: I admit, I like my French Vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side.  This isn't.  It's a much stronger coffee brew, meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor.  On the other hand, it's a reasonable alternative if my preferred brand (Van Houtte) isn't on sale or when it's occasionally out of stock.  I like that it comes in a 2-pack because our family goes through a lot of k-cups and I don't have to order quite so often.

review/summary: What I've Been Looking For
review/text: I was very excited when I received a Keurig coffee maker as a Christmas present, & couldn't wait to put it to use.  However, in the three months since I've had it, I have struggled to find what I think is a good cup of coffee.  Most of the brands I've tried have either been too weak or too strong.<br /><br />I am not a "Starbucks" kind of coffee drinker, or fan of fancy flavored coffees.  I just like a regular cup of coffee that smells good when it's brewing, & tastes smooth when I drink it.  Finally, just like Goldilocks said, this one is "just right".

review/summary: Very Good Coffee
review/text: I got this with the purchase of 24 different bold coffee k-cups to find the ones I like best, and so far this is my favorite. It may not be bold enough for some, but it is not supposed to compete with the 'extra bold' varieties. This was smooth and not nearly as bitter as many bold coffees. So many bold blends have a 'burned' flavor, leaving a bad taste in your mouth, this one was strong without the bad aftertaste, perfect for me!
