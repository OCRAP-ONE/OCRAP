review/summary: So happy to find this here!
review/text: We had a Moonstruck chocolate shop at our mall a few years back, and that's where I first tried this cocoa. It's very rich and chocolately, with a nice hint of almond and spice. I was really disappointed when the store closed down, but quite glad I can order it through amazon now. It's a little pricey as far as cocoa goes, but it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />I usually cut down the amount I use by half, so the chocolate isn't too thick. You can cook this in the microwave like swiss miss, but I recommend doing it the old fashioned way on the stove, as it does take a bit longer to dissolve than a few other cocoas I've tried. Their dark chocolate cocoa is also pretty amazing.

review/summary: Good gluten-free flour
review/text: I buy most of my flours from Bob's Red Mill in the 4-pack boxes, if only because having all the bags and boxes the same size makes it easier to store them.  It's good flour, and the bag's a good size for baking for a small family - also a good shape that will stand up on the counter while you scoop flour out of it.

review/summary: Tapioca...beyond the Fish Eye Pudding
review/text: Tapioca starch is a very handy item to keep in the kitchen. It is a thickener, but a very delicate one. There is a very slight sweetness to it that I think adds considerably to duck, chicken or goose gravies, or pork gravy.  The smoothness is like that of cornstarch, and and it gives sauces the same sort of sheen.  Tapioca flour is a good fast fix if your sauce is too thin and you don't know where you went wrong. I have even added a tiny bit to a runny Hollandaise and it worked perfectly. But be careful. Add it in pinches. It thickens quickly and under low temperatures. Don't overdo. And you can freeze sauces or gravies made with tapioca starch. If you use flour, they tend to break down and the texture can be a little grainy.<br /><br />I've bought this under the names Tapioca Starch, Tapioca Flour and Tapioca Powder. So far they are all identical. Bob's Red Mill is reliable. The texture of some of the asian imports is even better, but they're hard to find and not all equal in quality. Bob's Red Mill is a nice go to brand for anything from sorghum, amaranth, coconut and almond flours to fava bean flour. I haven't experimented with most of them, but plan to try the more exotic ones and see what happens.<br /><br />If you read James Michener, you probably remember his recipe for Oyster Stew in "Chesapeake."  The description was so mouth-watering, it sent me searching through a one hundred mile radius for an Asian market that sold the "secret ingredient." (This was back in those sad, dark days before the internet put the entire world within reach of our credit cards).  Here's how Michener's oysterman, Jimbo, made his He-Stew (a she-stew, fit for ladies, is not, to this lady, worth bothering with). I've reduced the number of onions from 8 to one, oysters from 48 to one dozen (to serve four) and celery to one stalk. If you are cooking for a crew of hungry arstermen, feel free to use michener's proportions.<br /><br />Start with a mess of bacon, one large onion (chopped fine), 1 stalk of celery (ditto), 12 oysters or more to taste (and pocketbook), oyster liquid, tapioca powder, milk, saffron, butter.  Jimbo fries the bacon until it's crisp, sets it aside and tosses the chopped onion and celery into the sizzling bacon fat. He cooks them quickly, so I'm thinking it's just a sweating, not a browning. Anyway, whisk them out after about a minute and add the oysters to the hot fat. You want to put a light browning on them...not cooked, now, just browned.  When the oysters are a lovely golden shade, lower the temp to barely simmering and pour in their liquor; let them simmer until the gills start to wrinkle.  (You want about 1/2 cup, give or take, of oyster liquid. If your oysters come up short, you can add bottled clam juice, chicken stock or water. Clam juice is best. Now throw in a small, and I mean small like 1/8 teaspoonful, pinch of tapioca powder. Remove the pan from heat and you should be able to see the tapioca powder start to thicken into what looks almost like a thin jelly. If this isn't happening, add another 1/8 teaspoon.  Let it bloom for about 3 minutes.  In a separate saucepan, simmer about 2 cups of milk (half and half would be gilding the lily. Don't be tempted. Just plain whole milk is going to be plenty rich). Pour the pan of oysters into the hot milk (Big Jim doesn't drain any of the bacon fat, but it might not be a bad idea to drain all but about one tablespoon of the delicious heartstopper). Then toss in the sauteed onion and celery. You can pour this into a big tureen or individual bowls, and crumble the bacon on top.  Big Jimbo gave it the added blessing of a sprinkling of saffron and, right before serving, a big hunk of butter. I like to serve from a big tureen, so guests know there is plenty and they can ask for more, but I add the butter to each individual bowl, so that melting gold and the buttery fragrance are the first things to hit the hungry crowd.<br /><br />This is so amazingly good, all conversation stops. People just slurp up their soup and their oysters.  Since this is a soup, find the smallest oysters you can. You don't want guests wrassling to swallow an animal as big as their palm.  After everyone has eaten to repletion, those with whom you shared this feast will kiss your hand in humble adoration. I usually serve this with ale, because I think you need something bubbly and tart to cut through the richness and I just like ale and oysters. But something flinty in a white wine, like a steely chardonnay, might go down very nicely.<br /><br />When I make this, I double and sometimes triple the recipe (because everyone wants seconds and, frequently, thirds) and make it a main course with lots of good bread and sweet butter.  Sauteed mushrooms and onions are a nice starter, a leaf or two of salad to follow. This is a good dinner to end with a cheese course, because it's rich, but not heavy and if anyone has any extra room to fill, the cheese hits the spot. Since the meal was creamy, you could jack things up with something sharp like a nice aged Reggiano, and some pears. No dessert is necessary, but if you skip the cheese, poached fruit is nice. If you have port, serve it with the cheese, or use it to poach the pears. It's a killer of a final touch.<br /><br />This is so easy to fix, a last minute dish that takes five minutes to prepare and another ten to make, and it's better than some concoctions that take an entire day of fussing and feuding to get on the table.<br /><br />(My other favorite non-recipe from a non-cookbook is from Peter Freuchen's Arctic diaries. He cooks up a mean Giviak, which is fermented seal stuffed with whole unplucked and uncleaned birds. You don't cook it exactly, you just bury it in the ground for about a year and let everything molder away until the birds taste like gorgonzola. You have to debone the seal without cutting it, so, what with all the hunting involved, there's a lot of prep time even if you don't do anything with the birds but catch them. The only beverge I could recommend is Alka Seltzer, but Freuchen recommends hot boiled moss water. Mmmmm. Moss water.)

review/summary: Good food and my dogs love the taste
review/text: There are a number of dry dog foods that are nutritionally similar to this. We've tried several of them. My dogs like most foods, but they get bored eventually so we try something new. They love Dogswell Vitality! In fact, I bought this and two other new foods. They immediately preferred this one. No corn/wheat means my dogs won't have digestion problems. Also, one of my dogs needs more bulk, and this food has more fiber than others we've tried.

review/summary: Dogswell Products.....
review/text: We have a Lab/Retriever Mix that we rescued from a shelter about six years ago.<br />Baxter (the dog) developed an allergy to the food he was eating and began to lick and chew on his paws incessantly.  It was beyond annoying.....keeping us up at night..  We were given a suggestion to try Dogswell Vitality.  This was the best advice we had ever been given.  The licking and chewing stopped.  We were not feeding him cheap dog food to start with, but he did develop an allergy to it.  We have been using Dogswell for about 3 years.  I wish we had known about it sooner.<br /><br />Dogswell Vitality did cost more....however it lasts longer...considering the fact that you feed your dog less per meal.  I am very happy with Dogswell products.

review/summary: EXCELLENT FOR DOGS WITH ALLERGIES
review/text: This food is wonderful for our Shar-Pei mix.  He suffered from terrible skin allergies until we pinpointed the source as a food sensitivity.  The Dogswell food doesn't contain the ingredients (wheat, corn, etc.) that other foods contain that tend to be an irritant for sensitive dogs.  Not only has this alleviated his skin allergies - he seems to love the taste too!  Our other dog who does not suffer from allergies eats it too and she loves it. Being able to order this directly from Amazon has been wonderful and is SO much more cost effective than in the specialty pet stores!  Thank you Dogswell and Amazon!

review/summary: One happy dog
review/text: This is great food, quality ingredients and apparently delicious. Sydney, our Aussie mix usually struggles when we change her food, however that was not the case when we switched to Vitality, she loves this stuff.  The best thing about this food is how it is processed by her body - the resulting poop is small, solid and easy to pick up - while all poop stinks there is a huge difference between using a quality dog food like Vitality and something of less quality that you pick up off the grocery shelf. The other advantage to a higher quality food is I don't have to be overly concerned when my toddler decides it would make a yummy afternoon snack.  Overall we are very happy with this food.

review/text: My dogs LOVE this food.  They had a lot of intestinal problems before we started feeding them this food and all of those problems seem to have cleared up.  It is VERY expensive, but it is healthy and rated as one of the best dog foods.  Our boys love it and they seem to be doing better now that they are on a better diet.  The only complaint I have is with Amazon because the subscribe and save price has risen $5/bag since I started ordering the food from them 5 months ago.  But the price is mostly worth it because my boys are happy and healthier.

review/summary: My Husky's favorite food
review/text: We love this dog food. When our Husky was adopted, he was underweight, had a dull coat and was lethargic.  After some trial and error with getting him to eat, and all the dog food recalls, we found Dogswell. Now his coat is absolutely beautiful, his weight is perfect and he has a ton of happy Husky energy. We get compliments all the time about how soft, shiny and pronounced his coat is. We also notice less year round shedding and just deal with the seasonal coat blow. He is a finicky eater, but always excited for mealtime on Dogswell food. He also used to scratch and lick his one leg raw in spots. Once we started Dogswell,his itches and rashes never came back.  He never gets an upset stomach, poops less often because there is no filler. I cannot recommend this food enough. We've tried other brands such as Blue Buffalo, AvoDerm, Organix and nothing has compared to how well our dog does on Dogswell foods. We go back and forth between Vitality and Happy Hips, depending on what Amazon has available with no ill effects.

review/summary: The only dog food my dog eats without salmon oil on top
review/text: I've had dogs my whole life and I've never seen such a picky eater as my pooch Sofia.  She's now 2, as healthy as can be, but won't eat.  I've tried tough love, going 5 days taking her bowl away when she refused food and I sorta believe she didn't like her food du jour for a reason (allergy, taste, something...).  I've tried at least 20 different kinds of high quality and expensive brands.  I had taken to squirting Salmon oil on the top of her kibble to make it more appealing and that generally worked for the types she was 'ok' with.<br /><br />However, Sofia eats this Vitality product without Salmon oil, days of starvation or visiting dogs which would sometimes prompt her to action.  For me and really for Sofia, this is the best food made.  Honestly I really can't believe a dog won't eat but she loves this!!!<br /><br />**2/20/12:  Updated Review<br />The picky dog is back, I had to buy more salmon oil so I can finish the bag.  Oh well it was nice while it lasted....It seems she liked the smaller bags much more than the large (22.5 lb) bags.  She didn't even give that food a second look but always ate the 4 lb bag food.

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: We just recently added a corgi to our family, and I started researching different types of wet and dry foods for our pup. After trying different raw diets, we eventually settled on the Weruva brand of dog food. Our local pet store recommended it to us, and the girl working actually opened up a can and started eating it! It's processed in Thailand, and before that scares anybody, you have to realize that the food processing laws in Thailand are MUCH more strict than in America (read it up online!). They are not allowed to process by-product in their pet food, or use filler product. Weruva definitely does not have any of that--you can actually eat the dog food and it'll taste just like dinner.<br /><br />Our boy has a sensitive stomach and he's a very picky eater. The first night we got him the regular Chicken with Gravy he ate that whole can up. He loved it, and when we tried feeding him anything different he refused. Then we ordered him the Kobe Master flavor and it quickly became one of his favorites. I'd definitely recommend this brand, especially coming from a very concerned dog owner. I won't feed my dog anything else.

review/summary: Yay~
review/text: My dog is picky with food, I mean PICKY!!!  She is not big on eating.  No biscuit type treat has worked on her.  She even refused a stranger trying to feed her real meat!(She doesn't trust strangers I guess...)  After months of trying every type in the market.  I'm saying all of this to say that she is super pickyk.  She'll only eat real chicken breast jerky, dingo brand bone with chicken in the middle, and the weruva brand wet food.  (And fresh vegies and fruit... mystery)  Anyhoo, of all the dog food/treat in the market, she LOVES this one the best.  That says a lot.

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: Please ignore the 1 star review.  That's an Amazon mistake and this terrific dog food doesn't deserve a one star because of an Amazon tagging error.  Weruva is one of the only genuinely human grade dog food products available.  My three pugs had totally gone off their food for days until I tried this brand .... I was going to buy Merrick (which they don't like very much) and found this instead.  It is spectacular.  Doesn't even smell like dogfood.  And, Amazon's price is very reasonable compared to my local retailer.  THIS IS A GREAT DOGFOOD PRODUCT and really worth trying out if you are an animal lover.  BTW - I now give it to my cats too and they are the fussiest eaters in the world -- they love it too.

review/summary: She'd stand on her head for this!
review/text: I ordered both this type and the Paella for our Akita, and I have to say hands down, this is the only food that she gets excited about about EVERY time. She is a picky eater, and sometimes the other food, has to be put in the refrigerator because I don't want it to spoil. I don't give her this "flavor" all the time though, because I want it to be more of a reward type meal. Have not tried the Kobe flavors yet, but am looking forward to...am waiting for the economy to pick up a bit more to try these ones just in case she is not as crazy about these as she is the pork version.

review/summary: Makes my dogs sick
review/text: While the ingredients look good (though the water content is 80% while most of the better brands have 78%) this food has managed to get two of my dogs sick!  Vomiting and uncontrollable bowel movements.  One dog is 17 yrs old and the other 4 yrs old.  I stopped feeding the older girl this food some time ago but discovered I still had cans so I gave a can to the 4 yr old.  After two days on the food he became sick.  He is now on rice and chicken for the next few days.  I cannot recommend this food to anyone.

review/text: I switched my kitties to Weruva a few months ago, and I'm so happy with this product. The food looks/smells/feels like actual chicken a human would eat, and the kitties love it. While they've always been healthy cats, their coats have gotten even shinier since I've started feeding them an all-wet diet (including Weruva), and they're maintaining a healthy weight and activity level. I'd highly recommend this food to other pet owners, and Amazon's price (with the free shipping) is the best I've seen.

review/summary: decent dog food, but Fromm's is better
review/text: This brand is not bad, the ingredients are all good. However, compared to Fromm's canned dog food, I was not impressed. There seemed to be more liquid in the can and the can was not as full. Also, my puppy's stool turned more runny after eating this. I did not have this problem with the Fromm's canned food which definitely was more solid and less liquid. I give the company credit for using quality ingredients but the food truly looked more watery and filled with liquid. Maybe that is good for cats but I tried their dog food for our puppy.  I will go back to Fromm's and exchange the remaining cans of Weruva.

review/text: I love Weruva for my dogs, let me say that up front. I ordered 2 cases of this food, and out of 24 cans FIVE were usable. The rest were so badly dented that they were opened and molded. When I tried to return it, I found that This food has a NO RETURN policy. I ended up paying more than $10.00 a can for those 5 cans. NOT ACCEPTABLE. I have been ordering my dog food through Amazon for some time, and this shipping problem is getting worse. Much of the product arrives dented, but unopened. Instead of throwing money away like this, I will pay a little more and pick it up myself! Buyers, please be aware of this NO RETURN policy!!!!

review/summary: Good food, easy delivery
review/text: I have two small-ish dogs (both should weigh about 12-15 pounds each), who are 9 and 11 years old. Feeding them never used to be an issue; we used a nice quality dry food, and they ate out of one bowl together. A few years ago, though, one of them became dangerously ill, and is now diabetic with heavy cataracts in both eyes, so being sure she gets enough to eat at the right times has become much more important. I mix a quarter of a can with a half cup of our dry dog food for each dog twice a day. This gives both of them the right calories (the other dog is more plump because when food falls, she is the only one who can see it!), and the wet food ensures that my diabetic pup eats everything in her bowl. Amazon's price is better than what I pay locally, and it arrives sooner than what the delivery-by date is.

review/summary: My pup's favorite brand of canned food
review/text: My pup, a corgi/chi mix who rarely gets people food yet somehow is so very picky, LOVES weruva. He has tried other very high quality brands and has now been turning his nose up to those after he has tried this. He has so far tried and loved the paw-lickin chicken, grandma's chicken soup, and wok the dog.  These are especially great if you like to have something to mix in with kibble because they have a good amount of sauce in it, though not too much in my opinion to feel like you're getting jipped.<br /><br />I have not yet purchased them from amazon so I cannot comment on the shipping quality.  Although I have bought online elsewhere and it arrived via fedex, some a little dented but all cans still useable.  Glad to see weruva is on amazon, will have to order from here next time I need to purchase.

review/text: My Cavaliers absolutely love this product.  I give it to my nursing moms to keep weight on them.  Some of them tend to get picky when they're nursing, but this brand of food is always more than appreciated by my little mamas.  :) I would like to explain just a bit further.  My largest expense with my show dogs is for their top quality food, even more costly than our vet expenses!  If my spoiled fur family loves this food, I, for one, am convinced it's a top-notch product. I wish it were cheaper, but all things considered, it's an acceptable price for the quality.

review/summary: Gross! Try before you buy!
review/text: I bought a package to try and it ended up in the garbage. The crackers themselves weren't so bad, but they had a powdery coating like the cheddar flavoring had been sprayed on, and the flavor was very sour, like spoiled milk left in the car. (if you have kids you know what I'm talking about). And not just in a "sharp cheddar" kind of way either.<br /><br />The cracker itself was much thicker and more firm than I expeted, so it would probably work for dips, spreads, etc.<br /><br />I recommend Blue Diamond nut chips which taste like their smokey nuts in a can.<br /><br />I am going to give the regular Brown Rice crackers a try, But I do not recommend the cheddar.

review/text: This is the salt you want for your popcorn.  In the Air Force Squadron I was known and Captain Popcorn, now I am known as Dad Popcorn.  This salt is ground fine which is perfect for popcorn.  The bigger granules on table salt are to large and will make your popcorn to salty tasting.  With this salt and my Great Northern Popcorn machine, Orville Redenbacker corn (yes more expensive but I have yet to find a popcorn which pops up fluffier and with fewer 'old maids') and Louanna coconut oil you will be all set.  I have also found alternating batches  with coconut oil and vegetable oil seems to make a nicer overall taste as well.  I also salt each batch as it finishes with this salt and mix it around a bit with the scoop.  If you really want something special fresh grade parmesan cheese on your corn, I guarantee you will love it.

Your home popped popcorn will taste so much better with real popcorn salt instead of regular granulated salt. Normally I wouldn't want to buy a pack of 12 (after all, each one lasts quite a while) but I have taken to giving them to friends who can't believe how much better popcorn is this way. (Also, I *highly* recommend Trader Joe's organic popcorn to put this on - if you have a Trader Joe's near you, it's way less expensive than Redenbacher and even better.)

review/text: I bought these for my wife actually because she can eat Almonds but not Peanuts. THESE HAVE PEANUTS IN THEM!<br /><br />Fortunately I was able to eat them. But my wife was out of luck. If you suffer from peanut allergy beware, the name of the product is deceiving.

review/text: These are unbelieveably good!  I've been indulging in them for 6 months now.  I'm glad Amazon is carrying them now b/c I previously had to have my sister buy me a ton (she lives in Portland OR where its trendy and I live in middle of nowhere MN where we have nothing good! LOL) and mail them to me.  Just now I was bummed to see that I am down to my last pack of them, but I'm happy that I can order them from Amazon now.  Amazing product - give em a try, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Good, but not great.
review/text: Dark chocolate and almond butter--two of my favorite foods.  When I found out that Sunspire makes these dark chocolate almond butter cups, I was so very tempted to buy the 24-pack.  I refrained, though, because I wasn't sure it was worth paying $40 for a large package of edible items I had never even tried.  Instead, I happened to come across individual packages at the local food co-op, and was extremely jazzed to give them a try.  Unfortunately, they left me a little disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, the dark chocolate was really delicious, but that was about all I could taste.  There was hardly any almond butter within the cup itself, and that was what I was really excited about.  I would estimate that by volume, the cup is 80% chocolate and 20% almond butter.  So, in the end, it's not your Reese's-caliber cup, with a light covering of chocolate on the outside and a generous helping of nut butter on the inside, but it will definitely satisfy a sweet-tooth in a pinch, and the product appears less processed and even a bit healthier than the more popular alternatives.  My suggestion: don't blindly buy the 24-pack: see if you can find an individual pack to try first.

review/summary: Rice Thins
review/text: I love Sesmark Rice Thins!  I have intolerances to wheat, dairy, soy and eggs.  So, finding a cracker that does not contain either of these are hard.  So, I found out about Sesmark about 5 months ago and every since then, I have been hooked.  So, if you have intolerances but still crave something crunchy, slightly salty, then the Sesmark Rice Thins are for you.

review/summary: white rice IS brown rice...just naked...
review/text: To the two-star review that has decided to eschew this product because the ingredients are "white rice with rice bran" instead of brown rice, that's a difference without distinction. Brown rice is unpolished white rice. For manufacturing/cooking or some other reason, the manufacturer decided to use polished brown rice, i.e. white rice and then add back the bran. I see no downside.<br /><br />To go further, they're crackers, not your main source for anything. If you eat rice as a staple or because you can't have wheat, then by all means serve brown rice, but like I said, they are a snack. Ok, beat that to death... now on to the review.<br /><br />I didn't realize that Amazon sold these, so I've been buying them in the supermarket. Just ordered a 12-pack. I like that they have no after-taste, have lots of crunch, will stand up to dip (or salsa, although they are a little small for that) and that they are relatively low in calories compared to other crackers like Ritz, Triscuits, etc.<br /><br />There is only one negative. I have a very difficult time eating just a couple. I have to put the package back in the fridge, less they all disappear while I am doing the bills, watching tv, etc.<br /><br />...and my dogs love them, too...

review/summary: Do they use sea salt?
review/text: I love the taste of these rice thins alone or with taboule. I have one issue with these "natural" crackers that I just realized, though. It does not say if they use sea salt or processed salt. Most products that use sea salt will say so. I would like to know if it's natural salt or not. If it isn't and I find out about it, I will not eat these again. If I am not able to find out, again I probably will not eat them anymore. I can find no info on their website about it. Not even under FAQ. Processed salt is a chemical poison and should not be considered natural. If it is sea salt, they should say so on the package. My lower rating is for the fact that they may not be using natural salt and/or they don't clarify if they do. Natural salt=healthy  Commercially processed salt=very unhealthy<br />I am concerned about it because I know how dangerous Morton salt and crap like that is for you. When Morton first developed their "no clumping" chemical salt, they gave it to the farmer's cows in place of the natural salt they were normally given. In a very short time the cows developed health issues. As soon as they got them off the Morton "crap" the cows health were restored. Leave it to man to screw things up that God made perfectly.  This can't be a natural product without natural salt.

review/summary: Crunchy Carbs for Gluten-Free Folks
review/text: When I found out I was gluten-intolerant I had a lot of functional foods to replace. As I began to search out and try what the health stores and groceries had to offer I ran into a lot of truly unappetizing products - and no really great ones.<br /><br />When it came to crackers, breads, or other easy-to-use holders of spreads and dips and sandwich makings, I quickly learned that the bread choices were worse than eating cardboard. So I began to explore the various crackers.<br /><br />Most were rice based. Some were spiced up with flavorings that tasted like chemicals. Others were limp or crumbly. Some were terribly bland.<br /><br />Then I discovered Sesmark Rice Thins.<br /><br />They are quite crunchy, with a satisfying snap to them, and while the Brown Rice flavor is not an exciting taste, it serves very well with all sorts of other foods: sesame tahini or nut butters; babaganous, hummus, olive tepenade, caponata, etc; also with butter or cream cheese. They are not too salty, but do have a some sea salt that is just right for me in these settings.<br /><br />I also like them by themselves. A snack of 5 of these (about 40 calories, half a gram of fat) is satisfying for the odd moment of feeling like eating carbs.<br /><br />In fact, their blandness keeps me from wanting more than I 'need'. Limiting myself to 5 works very well.<br /><br />I really love the taste of the Sesame flavor of these Rice Thins, and could eat a full package at one sitting. They don't need any toppings, though they take them well. Their crunch is slightly less snappy, still great. If you like sesame, these are a great choice, gluten-free or not.

To add insult to injury, the shipping on 1 single 3.75 oz container was another whopping $8.99, for a grand total of $18.98, which works out to over $5 per ounce of salt.<br /><br />Again, it was my mistake, but you can easily find a whole case of salt on the web for what I paid for 1 container.

They had my brother and I, and were happily married for almost nineteen years before we devastatingly lost him to melanoma when I was only ten, my brother twelve. My mother and father were 42. Our lives, changed, but were always wonderful because my mother is so loving, nurturing, and attentive. I have wonderful memories of the 4 of us opening a package from my Mem'ere, (my grandmother), and my uncle, who is my mom's brother.<br /> The chocolate was always delicious of coarse, (they don't add wax to their chocolate like we do in the states), but I was always quick to find the Bergamot candy! When I was little the candy came in tins, and there are some sites that sell them in the tins still which are almost identical to the old ones. They used to break the pieces, so they were all different shapes and sizes, but all of them delicious! The sweet, light floral flavor and easily dissolving pieces just seem to melt away. They now come cut, and individually wrapped, so if you want to take a few in your purse you can! :)<br />We also visited France the year my father passed; my mother needed to be with her family for help and support. We stayed for a month, and got to visit Nancy, as well as many other amazing places. We even got to see the home my mother grew up in. My Mem'ere passed away a few years ago at 88 years of age, but my uncle and his 4-year-old son still live there, and we miss them so much. My uncle still sends us packages when he can, and we still open it together as a family. It's still as exciting to me as it was when I was 8. :)<br />I hope everyone enjoys these as much as I do! Best wishes!

review/summary: Great pick-me-up
review/text: Sugar for the office!  Great tasting product, made in the USA!  Not the best price I've found on the internet, but still less than ordering directly from the manufacturer.  This is a semi-soft candy that has a great flavor (lemon) and everyone seems to like it very well.  It is not chewy, just melts slowly in your mouth.

review/summary: Not a good flavor. Tasted like chemicals.
review/text: I was poorly surprised at how bad these taste. The after taste was horrible. This is just my opinion.<br /><br />Gave them to workers and they ate them up. To each his own, I guess.

review/summary: My favorite company for bully sticks hands down
review/text: I have seven dogs ranging from 40 to 120 lbs and they LOVE bully sticks.  I am always looking for the best deals and the best quality - particularly ones that are long lasting.  I love this company, Best Bully Sticks.  I think they produce a high quality product with a fair price.  This is obviously not a cheap chew toy, but their price is one of the best around and definitely the best for the high quality of the item.  I buy them because my dogs love them, they are safe (unlike Greenies or rawhide which can cause blockages), and the smell on this is very mild.  Size is as stated.  Buy with confidence!

review/summary: Meiji Choco Macadamia
review/text: These were absouluty delicious.  American chocolates have alot more parrafin or other substance that is just not chocolate leaving the mushy or waxy tasting and these are from Japan and have great texture and taste far superior than anything here in the states.  Try at least one box of these before you kick the bucket and you wont be disatisfied.
