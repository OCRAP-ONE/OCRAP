review/summary: This is the best canned meal I've ever eaten, YUM YUM YUM!
review/text: Annie's canned meals are our "go to" when our body cars feel lazy and out of juice.  Just pop open a can and feel it's organic goodness work it's way through your system.  The soy meatballs bring good karma protein to the table that gives you strength. Great for those days when you just don't feel like cooking but still want the kids to have something you know is good for them. In my opinion this product is the future.  Goodness and convenience is the new trend that has to stay :)<br />One Love,<br />The Phillips Family

review/summary: Get Fired-Up with "Satan's Blood"!
review/text: "Satan's Blood Chile Extract" is a high quality product and I highly recommend it. The bottle is nice but be careful when opening it because the nature of the latch makes it easy to get a small amount of the extract on your finger (which can be dangerous if you wiped your eye). The extract looks like real blood and is VERY HOT... especially if you're not conditioned to using TRUE hot sauces / extracts. When I say conditioned to using TRUE hot sauces / extracts, I don't mean weak sauces like Tabasco, Louisiana, or other so called "hot" sauces from your local grocery store. If you think grocery store sauces are hot then "Satan's Blood" more than likely will be too extreme for you...even one drop.<br /><br />To put things in perspective...the original classic red variety of Tabasco pepper sauce measures 2,500-5,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU). "Satan's Blood" measures 800,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU)! The means it's up to 320 times hotter!! It's best used as a food additive. I like how I can put just a drop or two in a bowl of chili and it makes it hot but does not change the overall taste like weaker vinegar based sauces will.<br /><br />As a hot pepper enthusiast, I rate this product as VERY HOT...but not extremely hot. Remember though, like beauty, hotness is in the eye of the beholder. Most people WOULD rate this as EXTREMELY HOT...but I've been a fan of hot foods for decades. I've grown many different peppers including but not limited to jalape&ntilde;o, Cayenne, and Haba&ntilde;ero. Plus, I use extracts like "The Source Collectors Extract"...which is rated at hell fire level 7,100,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU)!!!<br /><br />Five Stars!

review/summary: Five stars for sure
review/text: I would second everything stated in the review by J. Eisenhauer, except that I would definitely rate the product EXTREMELY HOT.  Mind you, that is not meant as a complaint, but rather a compliment.  Even when cooking a potful of food, you generally do not need more than one drop of Satan's Blood added to the mix.  (And heck, if you then find you do want more heat you can always add another drop!)  The result will be a very robust level of hotness that will enhance the flavor of the food.  Just watch for any redness on your fingers after handling the bottle, and if you see any, wash thoroughly and NEVER rub your eyes first!  This is VERY serious stuff.  Handle with care, and enjoy the results!

review/summary: Great googley moogley!
review/text: First off, let me read the label to you:<br /><br />"Conceived on Friday the 13th in October 2000, during a full moon. WARNING! EXTREMELY HOT.<br />NOT A HOT SAUCE. FOOD ADDITIVE ONLY. AVOID ANY AND ALL CONTACT WITH SKIN AND BODY<br />PARTS. KEEP AWAY FROM CHILDREN"<br /><br />I might add that you should not use this to wash your cat with either.<br /><br />This warning should be enough to get your attention, then you've got that cool picture of the<br />Devil on the other side, that usually means bad news. However, the glass bottle and the novelty<br />makes this a must have for any pepperhead's collection.<br /><br />The label also advises that this stuff rates out at 800,000 Scoville units.  For comparison, that's<br />3 times hotter than your typical habanero and 300 times hotter than your average jalapeno. Like they<br />say, THIS AIN'T A SAUCE!<br /><br />So don't put this on your tongue, it burns. However, this makes a great addition to chili, salsa, and<br />other sauce that need to be jacked up....in a big way. Leave it out on your counter as a conversation<br />starter, but if you have deregulated beer intake, make sure nobody gets too bold with this stuff<br />knowhudahmsayin?

review/summary: Super hot, but good.
review/text: I got sick of my hot sauces, and thought I'd try some of the hot stuff. I bought a few Ghost Pepper hotsauces from Amazon, and saw the Satans Blood. I decided it looked like someting I'd like so I picked some up. As soon as it got here I put a dab on my finger and tasted it (Not recommended). It tastes OK, but it is not hot sauce that you'd put in your Burrito. The heat lasts a while, so be prepared. Satan's Blood is more an additive that you'd put one (And I do mean one) drop in a bowl of chilli. It will heat up the whole bowl with just one drop. I also put it in a big Wok of Stir Fry, or in some Risotto if you like such things. I really like this product. You can make anything you want hot, and it does not change the initial flavor. That is what I use it for anyway.

Drinking these instead of normal drinks is a great way to shed a few hundred calories from your diet a day.

review/text: It seems hard to find great muesli these days. I think this is one of the better ones, and I do buy it. However, I wish those making muesli would heed the latest nutritional advice. For example, nutritionists say that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is important and that we generally get too much of the omega-6 fatty acids and not enough of the omega-3's. This muesli would be a lot more nutritious if it replaced the large amount of sunflower seeds (high in omega-6 fatty acids) with walnuts (high in omega-3 fatty acids) and almonds. And to me that would make it taste better too. I also wish they would make a version without all the raisins and dates, allowing one to add fresh fruit (e.g., raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, etc.) instead of dried fruit.<br /><br />I was in Australia last spring and found great muesli there not only meeting these nutritional criteria but tasting better than this or most other muesli. To me nuts are an important part of good muesli. But I'm being a bit of a purist, I know, and a friend tells me I'm a food snob, so take my opinion with that in mind!

review/summary: deelish AND good for you!
review/text: I ordered this through Amazon because it was such a good bargain. I can't even find the muesli at any of my usual stores here in San Antonio, so I was excited to find Amazon could ship it out. I anticipated it would be a good product, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />It's not overly sweet; the dates and raisins take care of any sugar cravings you might have, but they're not so sweet that you feel like you're getting a kids' breakfast cereal. Instead, what you get is a very nutty flavor enhanced by a delicate sort of sweetness. If you want more sweetness, I suggest you add a dollop of honey. That would just put this over the top. I guess you could also use some artificial sweetener, but I'd not do that. Why mess up a wonderful "natural" product with something artificial like aspartame or the like? Yuk.<br /><br />I love the addition of sunflower seeds and flax, and the oats are especially healthy choices for this mix. YOu can eat this hot or cold, with cold being my preferred mode, but I like the hot version, too. I make mine with evaporated skim milk, which allows for a richer milk flavor without any of the fat. It's a hearty breakfast food, but I think you could also use it for dinner on especially cold evenings when you want something that will "stick to your ribs" and be all-around healthy as well. Oats--good for your heart. Flax--ditto. Sunflower seeds--good source of protein, I think. Dates and raisins--can't go wrong there, but don't ask me to pinpoint a body part they particularly benefit. Heh. Let's see--lots of whole grains here, so you will get your servings of the stuff that will keep you healthy, happy, and "reglar." :-)<br /><br />I love that this is so healthy a food and that it also tastes great!<br /><br />I plan to order more Bob's Red Mill products as a result of my good experience with this product.

review/summary: Quality muesli, but could use a little doctoring up
review/text: This is a great product. It's full of whole grains, impossible to eat without letting it soak, and completely delicious.<br /><br />To really improve the flavor, I do the following: put in 1/4 cup of plain yogurt, 1/4 cup of skim milk, 1 cup of muesli, a handful of crushed walnuts, and a handful of raisins. Let it soak overnight, and you'll have a couple perfect bowls of muesli. I think it gets even better after another day, too.

review/summary: Great, if you LOVE sunflower seeds!
review/text: I am impressed by the overall quality of the ingredients that go into this product.  Very healthy, and I prefer to eat it without soaking as recommended.  However, there are an overwhelming amount of sunflower seeds, so much that they overwhelm all the other great ingredients.  I know it is an inexpensive filler and prices are skyrocketing, but after a few days, it gets really boring to eat when it tastes like nothing but sunflower seeds, bite after bite.

review/summary: I Love Red Bob!
review/text: Finding Red Bob was one of the best things I have ever had happen to me in regards to food. My family as a whole has been trying to eat healthier and Red Bob has a mind boggling number of tasty offerings that will ultimately improve your diet. I am fairly new to Red Bob so I am really still in the experimental phase. They have so many offerings that its going to take some time to try them all out. I ordered the Muesli as I am constantly on the look out for new things I can eat with my yogurt. I started making fresh yogurt last year and to say its one of my favorite foods is an understatement. So again, I am constantly looking for new and healthy ways of spicing my yogurt up and improving on its nutritional contents. Well, to make a long story short, this was easily one of the best mixes I have had yet with my yogurt.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects to this mix is its much softer than granola, which is what I usually eat with my yogurt. I usually have to wait a few minutes for granola to soften up a bit but that isn't necessary with this mix. It has a great texture right out of the package and it ultimately gives it a fresher quality. As for the taste, its absolutely spot on. The raisins and dates add a perfect amount of sweetness and the flavor of the walnuts, almonds and sunflower seeds really shine through. Of course, with Flax Seed and 100% whole grain oats it quickly becomes apparent how healthy this mix is for you. All in all its easily one of the best muesli mixes I have ever had and I have tried quite a few. Its important to note that I actually add Manuka Honey when I eat it with yogurt but that is only to help sweeten up the yogurt itself. Again the dates and raisins add a perfect amount of sweetness if your eating the mix by itself, which I have done now on multiple occasions and its just as good on its own as it is in yogurt.<br /><br />I also have to mention what Red Bob did with his company recently. After receiving a massive amount of buy out offers over the years, many from the monster sized agri-food corporations, Red Bob finally decided what he was going to do with his company and he made his announcement at his 81st birthday party earlier this year. He turned down all of the offers (most of which had to be for HUGE amounts of money as a 2004 estimate put the companies yearly revenue at roughly 24 million dollars and the company is estimated to have seen 20-30 percent growth each year since then) and decided to simply give the company to his employees. Yes, that's right, he gave it to his 209 employees. I cant even begin to tell you how much respect I have in Red Bob for making this move and ultimately it just makes me want to support his company just that much more. He basically gave away hundreds of millions of dollars so his employees could own the company he started. That's just a level of class that you dont see very often in modern society. I became a customer for life when I read that story. Red Bob is just an amazing guy. Oh, and by the way, happy 81st Bob!<br /><br />Bottom line - Again finding Red Bob was easily one of the best things that has ever happened to me in regards to food. Now that I have found Red Bob....well, lets just say I couldn't imagine my cupboards, or my diet for that matter, without him. I have only tried roughly 10-12 items from Red Bob's catalog but out of those items this Muesli Mix is definitely in my top 3. Its great by itself, both hot and cold, and its ever better on yogurt. If you haven't tried Red Bob then this would be a perfect place to start.<br /><br />5 Stars!

review/summary: Absolutely the Best Ever!
review/text: I didn't have high hopes for this but thought I needed to be eating something super-good for me and quick and easy.  Many of the reviewers liked it hot or soaked so I thought it must be hard chunks of dates and raisins, but ALAS, no it's not!  The nuts and seeds have crunch and the dates and raisins are moist and soft and will not send you to the dentist in any way.  It really is delicious right out of the bag and don't think that you have to cook it or soak it in order to enjoy it.  Would also be great with yogurt of course, and ice cream and incorporated into cookie dough.

review/text: I have hot cereal every morning. I mix muesli and oat bran together and cook it in unsweetened almond milk. You can add fruit and nuts if you like. Use some sweetener other than white sugar. The Red Mill Muesli gives it a great taste and texture. It's hard to find this muesli anywhere. I'm glad it's sold on Amazon. By the way you get more than enough fiber if you make it like I do.

review/summary: way too many sunflower seeds
review/text: This cereal is fresh, healthy, and beautifully packaged. There are just WAY too many sunflower seeds! Sunflower seeds are listed as the 3rd ingredient after whole grain wheat and date crumbles. Every bite is a mouthful of sunflower seeds and the taste overwhelms the other ingredients. If you like sunflower seeds a lot, this is the cereal for you. But I don't care for how prominent the flavor and texture of sunflower seeds are in this product.

review/summary: Awesome :)
review/text: Bought this because our local supermarket doesn't seem to know what good muesli is. It arrived within days on the east coast, despite its apparent origins in the Northwest (I suspect Amazon has it warehoused in Philadelphia). Packaging was strong and protected the merchandise, which was fresh, in 4 smaller bags, and stayed fresh in an airtight container. I mixed it down to about 30-40% total, using plain old fashioned oats and Kellog's All-Bran to get just what I wanted. I love it. My wife loves it too. Add a banana, pour on some milk and leave it sit about 10 minutes. The perfect breakfast.

This is my first hot cereal and I admit I bought it thinking it was just regular-cold cereal~~ a mistake that turn out good though!<br /><br />I don't mind using only water but I add a little bit of honey to add some flavor.

review/summary: Everything I expected
review/text: For those of you who says this cereal is dry and hard to chew or any similar comments, and for those of you planning on buying this cereal, you must remember that you HAVE to soak the cereal in your liquid for at least 10-15 minuteS! (up to overnight) Whether that liquid is milk of any kind,yogurt, water, whatever. The rule for servings is a 1:2 ratio of cereal to liquid. Other than the slight preparation time needed, this cereal is surprisingly good for a healthy cereal. A little more calories than your sugary Kellogs or General Mills cereal and takes a tiny bit of getting used to, but those calories come in more GOOD carbs and fats instead of nothing but bad carbs and sugar like other types of cereal.<br /><br />I also like the fact that it is very versatile. I haven't tried the chocolate chip cookie recipe on the bags yet but I've heard that it's good. And it would not hurt at all to add any kind of fruit of your liking to this cereal, chopped apples, blueberries, cherries, bananas etc. And you can eat it hot like oatmeal or cold. I would NOT buy this cereal however if you do not like sunflower seeds because, as others have said, there is a very noticeable amount of them in it.<br /><br />I did not expect this cereal to be good at all so honestly I bought it planning on it to be horrible. (was going to bear it out anyways due to the fact that I'm on a diet and want to have as a filling yet quick breakfast as possible without breaking my calorie consumption bank)I do add about 2 teaspoons of sugar or honey to mine, but Turns out that Bob's Red Mill Muesli is nothing that has to be borne. Don't get me wrong, not close to as good taste-wise compared to my oldtime favorites cinnamon toast crunch and captain crunch, but if you're looking for a healthier cereal that gets you through to lunch time without hunger at less than 350 calories including WHOLE milk and the optional honey or sugar,(so it would be even less if you're using 2% or fat free/skim/soy milk) then this is definitely the cereal for you. I'm about to purchase an order of the larger bags myself on subscribe & save. Those 40OZ bags are more than twice the cereal at less than twice the price so it is a better value but if you're not sure if you'll like this cereal, then these 18OZ bags will do as a trial order, as that's what I did.<br /><br />**Also I would like to add that the one serving size on the bag of 1/4th of a cup of cereal is ridiculous. My calorie counts in this review includes technically (2) servings at 1/2 a cup of cereal to one cup of liquid for each meal of eating this cereal.**

review/summary: As good as the best I've had in Europe
review/text: I make several trips a year to Europe and always have yoghurt, fruit, and muesli for breakfast (as well as cheeses, preserves & croisants, etc :). Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli is at least the equal of the best I've had. In my opinion, it is a far better value than the imported Familia Swiss Muesli that has a lot of broken-up and powdery oat residue that turns to glue in milk or yoghurt.<br /><br />I just finished my 4th bag that I ordered a few months ago and just ordered my next 4. I highly recommend this if you're in to European style muesli cereal. Just freeze the bags you aren't using and defrost for a few hours before you need it. This keeps it fresh and has no negative effects on texture since the moisture content is extremely low - feels and tastes the same as it went in.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDSES">Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 18-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: A nearly perfect cereal
review/text: For many years my cold cereal of choice has been Grape Nuts.  It has a decent flavor, unbeatable crunch, no added sugar, no "chemistry" ingredients, and an excellent nutrition profile.  (My hot cereal of choice has been old-fashioned oats w/ Raisins and Brown Sugar.)<br /><br />Well, after a trip to Europe I am now a convert, and this has displaced those faithful Grape Nuts for a permanent place in my pantry.  This remarkable cereal is made of simple ingredients; rolled whole grains (wheat, barley, and oats), dried fruits, seeds, nuts.  (Think granola without the sugar or the baking)  No added sugar, binders, starches, preservatives, oil, flavor enhancers, salt, etc.  For those concerned about processed food intake, take comfort that the only processing this has undergone is that the grains are steamed (which is done during the rolling process; this makes the grains edible), and then the drying of the fruit.  While it doesn't qualify as a "raw" food (grains are largely indigestible completely raw) it's much less processed than just about any other cold cereal out there except Granola.<br /><br />While it obviously has no crunch, it has a pleasant chewiness instead after soaking in milk while you take your shower or wait for your coffee to brew.  I usually chop up a banana or toss in some berries if I have them on-hand.  (I tired soaking overnight, and thought it got too mushy)  It has more flavor than the Grape Nuts, and two "servings" (2 x a puny 1/4 cup) of this make for a similar nutrition profile.  (The fruit displaces some of the starch for sugar, and the seeds add a trivial amount of fat.)<br /><br />I considered giving some genuine European Muesli a try, but the ones I looked at (Familia) have either sugar and/or a large amount of dried fruit, which, after having this stuff, is totally not necessary.  (Of course, as a Grape Nuts replacement, just about any cereal with sugar in it tastes sweet.)  The amount of dried fruit in this cereal is enough to give it a little flavor, without overwhelming you with cloying sweetness.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the Kellogs "Mueslix."  They started with traditional Muesli, and then they added unsweetened flakes (corn?) to it.  This introduces soggy nastiness for no particular reason.  I guess they thought suggesting the cereal soak for a few minutes (and leaving out the flakes) would be too complicated.<br /><br />The only "drawback" of this cereal is that it feels expensive for the little bag.  However, you can get eight hearty servings out of it, and you'd have to resort to some fairly pricey major-brand products to get something this tasty, unprocessed, and healthy.

review/summary: A nice additive to my yogurt
review/text: I got a sample pack of this at my weight loss seminar, with the suggestion that I add it to my yogurt.  So, that evening, I added a couple of tablespoons to some yogurt, let it sit for about 10 minutes and ate it (the yogurt was homemade, plain).  It really added something to the yogurt.<br /><br />Next, I tried another suggestion, and added the yogurt and let it sit overnight, and had it with lunch the next day.  Very good.  I often add Bob's Red Mill flaxseed meal to my yogurt, but that's now changed.  I'm adding this muesli instead.  (I'm still using the flax seed meal in other options though.)<br /><br />Now, I'm also adding some fruit, like blueberries or strawberries in with the muesli, which really makes the yogurt tasty.<br /><br />I've also tried heating milk and muesli, as per the instructions, and find it to be a very good hot ceral for breakfast.  I'm going to try the cookie recipe, as I'm sure that will be very good.  I will experiment with other uses for this, but I, and my girlfriend, are really enjoying it.  We're going to try adding honey, or agave nectar to see how that works too.<br /><br />And, with the subscription service on it, it will be coming regularly.<br /><br />Highly recommended

review/summary: Tasty and Filling But Soak It First
review/text: I didn't know what Muesli was until I happened to read an article extolling its virtues. Since this brand was readily available, I gave it a try. Others may disagree, but I discovered that just pouring milk and eating it like cereal doesn't work well. It was tough and tasted like forage. Soooo, I followed the label's suggestion and soaked it in low fat milk for about 10 minutes. Big difference. It softened the grains and reconstituted the fruit bits (I added some extra raisins, too). It tasted good and, as that original article said it would, kept me satisfied for many hours. I understand why some people soak it in yogurt, but I can't stand the stuff.

review/summary: Muesli & Yogart for a great morning
review/text: Muesli is hard to find in my area so was very please to find it on Amazon.  Great deal for a great product.  I actually bought this in part because of the reviews I read while searching for healthy breakfast foods.  Muesli and yogurt sounds like a great morning on the go breakfast.  And it really is!  I'm not a huge yogurt fan, but love whole grains.  This mix makes yogurt good!  I also got some freeze dried Acai berries on Amazon.  Here's a great boost: mixed a little under 1/2 scoop of Acai berries, 1/4 cup muesli and 3 oz or so of yogurt (I used Danimals smoothie last night), put it in the fridge and grab-n-go the next morning.  Wonderful!  My only complaint is that it didn't make enough for me, though it was perfect amount for the kids. This will now be part of my morning routine.  How did I manage without Muesli before now??

review/text: Bob's Red Mill Cereal Muesli is an excellent alternative to the typical breakfast cereal. I find it easy and fast to make using the stove-top cooking method, which is to use a little bit of water boiled in a pot of water and simmered for about 3 minutes. This would be good for people who are "on the run" in the morning.<br /><br />I also like it because it is low calorie, crunchy, and healthy.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDSES">Bob's Red Mill Cereal Muesli, 18-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>

review/text: i was hoping this was good, natural muesli. i didn't want anything similar to something i could purchase in a grocery store. bob's red mill did not disappoint. this is a chewy, tasty, very slightly sweet muesli. delicious. healthy. very filling. great cold w/ milk, or served warm. if you want sweeter, add a little honey or a banana. when you eat healthy, you will feel it. your body will thank you. a huge plus - the price is very good. health food stores charge a lot more for less quantity, and less quality. thanks amazon and bob's red mill. great partnership that benefits our health. happy, healthy new year.

review/summary: A Fast Decent Meal
review/text: I've eaten these on and off for a long time, probably more than 10 years at this point, and although Knorr has undoubtedly been a detriment to the product in its efforts to cut down on costs, the chicken and broccoli variety holds up quite well to this day.  I keep these around for nights when I don't feel like cooking, and they're very easy to make, particularly if you use the microwave.  A bit of water and butter, 12 minutes in the microwave, and dinner is ready.<br /><br />A few things to note:<br /><br />-This side dish is now half rice, half vermicelli pasta these days.<br /><br />-If you leave it in the microwave for even a few minutes after it's finished cooking, whatever sauce might have been left to moisten the dish WILL dry out quickly, leaving you with an edible, but not ideal meal.<br /><br />-While the dish has enough salt in the seasoning mix to make most people cringe upon looking, it tastes much better if you add some fresh pepper to it after cooking.  It gives a bit of an extra note where there is otherwise a pretty heavy chicken flavor throughout.  The broccoli does not come through all that great, but it does cut the chicken enough to merit buying the one with broccoli over the plain chicken variety.

People's reactions to it are equally strong.<br /><br />Second, a thank you to the tea-gods:  YAY for decaf!  This is excellent for those of us who want delicious genmai without the shakes.<br /><br />Third and finally, you're giving up a bit of flavor when you give up the shakes.  This is still a very good tea, but it loses that edge of mind-blowing deliciousness.  I like this, but if I haven't hit my caffeine limit for the day, I'll always reach for the fully caffeinated version first.

Although I have both caffeinated and decaffeinated, I drink the decaffeinated in the late afternoon or evening to keep warm and not having to worry that I won't be able to sleep. It works great when we have guests over too :) I drink the caffeinated tea in the morning. And, it goes great after dinner or after a meal...A Nice Warm Cup of light tea :)<br /><br />Price:<br />Buying this pack is like buying each for $.24 cents each, very worth it. If you bought it at stores, it is more expensive per bag. Regular store prices are about $10 for a pack of 6 bags. Buying this pack is well worth the money.

I debated on purchasing this 1# bag or the 200 ct. container and went with this size for easy transportation as we live overseas and I'll pack these in my suitcase.  The price comparison is negligible, with this 1# bag being slightly cheaper. These are very difficult to find in stores. I searched Costco, super walmart, smart & final, with no luck till I decided to just check and see if Amazon carries them. Bingo.  Can't go wrong with Amazon.

Honestly though, it makes me wonder if the beans sold in these bags are the same beans used at Starbucks.<br /><br />The coffee seemed weak and astringent, and while certainly not without merit, it just doesn't seem to be worth the cost.  The 3-pack sold here averages out to almost $10 a bag -- for $10, you can get something from Atomic Cafe or the Roasterie that will have you jumping out of bed every morning in anticipation of that first cup of TRULY excellent coffee.

review/text: I like this coffee, but you can find it at a Walmart for less and cherry pick the stock for the freshest packs; really important for these oily dark roasts.  Costco also sells the 2.5lb. bag for significantly less than amazon and a fresh bag makes a quite acceptable espresso so there's no need to stock a separate blend.  The only downside is you have to clean your  grinder much more often as the beans have a high oil content.<br /><br />Brew it strong as it doesn't like to be shorted in either espresso machine, french press or drip maker.  Enjoy...<br /><br />1/12/12<br /><br />I'm starting to see this varietal along with other whole bean Starbuck's coffees show up in different packaging WITHOUT A VISIBLE "GOOD BY" DATE (at least in my So. CA location).  Starbuck's claims ignorance, so if you value buying only fresh beans, start complaining to them via email at their "contact us" section on their web site.

review/summary: Old beans
review/text: My beans were not fresh when thery arrived. The oil was gone from the outside and they didn't have that wonderful aroma that they normally have when I open the bag. I think its best to buy your beans locally if you want them to be their freshest.

review/summary: Nothing wrong here
review/text: Why is Amazon reviewing this item? I purchased this in March and found it to be unchanged from 2 years of previous purchases except for new packaging. The beans were nice and oily indicating extreme freshness.

review/summary: Superior Coffee
review/text: This coffee is indeed robust.  Unless one wants Turkish, it is probably wise to use less than ordinary coffee, especially in a French press.  The price is a little high (Target sells it for almost $2 less per pound), but, given the smaller amount needed to brew a strong and delicious cup of coffee, the price is worth it!

review/summary: Full flavored, bold, and predictable!
review/text: Starbucks French Roast Extra Bold Coffee is a tasty, bold, and predicable brew.  And when I get it from Amazon on sale, it's a good buy.  In addition, Starbucks has been adding a coupon printed right on the bag for a free "tall" (12 ounce) coffee at a retail store.  So if you buy brewed coffee at Starbucks, then you get these three bags of coffee (try to get them on sale) plus three coupons.  The coupons are the same as taking another $1.60 or so off the price.<br /><br />With that said, I'd still rather get one larger bag than these three 12 ounce bags.  The bulk price should be cheaper, and there would be less waste.<br /><br />Peet's Coffee & Tea is another very predictable coffee company, and Caffe Ibis is tops for organic and fair trade coffee.

review/summary: Coffee is good, BUT
review/text: This coffee is Good.  BUT, I can buy in at Walmart for less than online. Also Walmart has a good selection of Starbuck and other brands.
