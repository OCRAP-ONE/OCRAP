review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I liked the variety and it tastes good and is very easy to make. This is awesome for college students who don't have access to a kitchen but it's also good because it's such a quick snack.<br /><br />The downside is that the bowls are very small. It could probably be a meal for kids but for adults, it's more a snack unless you decide to eat more than one but if you decide to, the box disappears quickly.

review/summary: Delightful Revival of an Old Favorite (if wrapper is all wrong)
review/text: I definitely remember buying Turkish Taffy in all four flavors (Vanilla, Bananna, Chocolate, and yes, Strawberry) for $0.05 at our local drugstore when I was a wee lad. I took a bit of a haitus because I became an adult (sort of), and because the Bonomos stopped making it. But I never forgot the wonderful flavors and consistency of the taffy; my favorite was the bananna.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when I saw Turkish Taffy for sale at our local County Fair last week! It was for sale for $1.59 almost 32X more expensive than it was thirty five years ago. But the flavor is right on (bananna and vanilla), and the consistency is excellent. I was able to break it up into nice pieces at room temperature with a few well placed whacks! The secret is to hit it several times at different places along the length of the bar against a hard, rounded or "blunt" object, such as the edge of a curb or a stair railing. Don't smack it against a flat surface. I was willing to overlook the incredible inflated price (Note; its cheaper here on Amazon - $1/bar if you get a 24-count box) and I enjoyed several bars.<br /><br />The only thing spoiling a very nice effort by the folks currently distributing the product is that the wrapper is all wrong. Either they didn't bother to do their reserach, or more likley, they are hoping we will overlook what is probably a large cost savings and manufacturing efficiency. Today's product is wrapped in a plastic sleeve that has a seam running down the back and is sealed on both ends. As millions of people my age know, this kind of wrapper makes it very difficult to get at the chunks, particularly the small ones, that you have just created inside the covering.<br /><br />The old wrapper was foil with the color matching the flavor on the outside (yellow for bananna, etc.), and silver metallic color on the inside. The metallic wrapper could be gently unfolded first on the ends, and then along the middle to expose 100% of the marvelous, freshly broken taffy...and then folded back up and stuffed into your pocket!! Very important for those quick getaways on your bike. (That might have had a bananna seat...)<br /><br />EXPLANATION OF STARS AWARDED:<br />**** for the effort to reintroduce Turkish Taffy + * for nice flavor - * for lousy wrapper + * for outstanding breakability = ***** Basically, the product quality trumps the lousy wrapper in my opinion, although I discovered its not a good idea to stuff a half-eaten bar wrapped in cheap plastic into your suitcoat pocket. So if you're listening Bonomo People, please bring back the foil wrapper. With the 20X price increase (based on Amazon's price for a box), there's got to be a little profit margin in there for the original, authentic foil. Really.

review/summary: I've Been Waiting 36 Years!
review/text: The last place I bought a Bonomo's Turkish Taffy bar was at a 7-11 convenience store in Orlando, FL. It was 1974 and I was 14 years old. Devastating, I know!<br /><br />As a military brat, service member and spouse, I have looked for genuine Turkish Taffy in nearly every corner of the earth only to discover that the recipe had been sold and then shelved without a single batch being made. I've made several attempts along the way to find something similar but all fell way short of satisfying. Plain salt-water taffy was okay but it was always too soft and airy. Then there was Doscher's French Chew taffy bar that purportedly is as close to Turkish Taffy as it gets. All I can say is, "ICK!"<br /><br />Now, before we get to the bottom line here you need to know that unlike so many others folks, cracking a Bonomo's was not necessarily an option in FL unless you took it home and stuck it in the fridge for a while (longer than the recommended five minutes). I suppose that might work if you lived next door to the 7-11 but who could wait that long? So, before leaving the store, I would already be peeling back the wrapper on my taffy bar and sinking my teeth in only to find that my teeth would be locked shut in the thick gooey taffy. Mmmm - Heaven!<br /><br />Back in the present, I finally received my box of Bonomo's Vanilla Taffy today - the ONLY flavor worth sinking my teeth into. Unfortunately, there was no way I'd be able to do so. Living in the Blue Ridge Mountains in NC, my taffy had apparently been sitting on a truck stuck in the snow for several days before they finally were able to make it up to our house. To my great disappointment the first bar out of the box was already cracked. I had no choice but to rip open the wrapper like the 14 year old I wish I still were and slip the very first cracked piece ever into my mouth with much anticipation.<br /><br />I was not disappointed!<br /><br />It's funny how the taste of certain foods remain with you, no matter how long it's been since you last had them. Like the original Liege Belgian waffles we used to get in the market a few blocks from our home in Brussels when I was eight years old. I returned to Brussels and that market several times in the late nineties and sure enough - those waffles were just as sweet, sticky with syrup from the partially dissolved "perle" sugar.<br /><br />And so it is with the new Bonomo's vanilla flavored Turkish Taffy. Thirty six years later and still, unmistakably genuine Bonomo's Turkish Taffy. Now to find a way to soften it just enough to get my teeth stuck in it again.<br /><br />I am now contemplating whether I should buy several cases of this stuff - enough to last 36 years perhaps. You know, just in case they stop making it again.

review/summary: fun candy
review/text: It is always fun to experience nostalgia and that is what happens whenever I eat one of these bars. I searched for them for years, they were a favorite of my mothers in the fifties and mine also. I found out they stopped being made in 1981. What a letdown. Then I discovered them in a catalog that deals in nostalgia. I don't know when they started making them again.Of course, I checked on line and found them much cheaper at Amazon. The price is right and the candy great. You smack the bar on a counter to crack it up to eat. It comes in other flavors, too. Only problem for me is that I would prefer to buy a box of assorted flavors instead of one box of 24 of one flavor, but since it's vanilla it's okay for now.

This is made with artificial flavor, mono and di-glycerides, and egg albumin - it's soft and tastes fake.  Any wax wrapped taffy that you buy in the store (although not the Bonomo style) wil probably be much better quality than this.  Don't waste your time.

review/text: This was my favorite candy as a child; thus, I remember it well. The present product isn't the same. The flavor is very artificial, in comparison to the rich vanilla taste that the original had. Today's manufacturer is likely using a lot of cheap, synthetic flavors, synthetic components, and a rapid manufacturing turnover process, all of which make it the end result inferior to the original.<br /><br />Those hoping for the real thing will have to continue hoping. New tasters will wonder what the [harsh artificial tasting] fuss is all about.

review/summary: Expensive, but very good. Intriguing... makes you get a second cup!
review/text: Never having bought REALLY expensive coffee like Kona, I was hesitant to spend the price on this one. However, I have having a hard time finding a light roast decaf coffee that had the flavor that I wanted, so I reluctantly decided to spend the money on it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was how SMOOTH my cup of coffee was... very creamy.  I LOVED that.  Then the aftertaste kicked in; a strong, intriguing flavor that was not at all unpleasant. I don't know how to exactly describe it, but it did make me go back for a second cup; I wanted to try it iced too!  It was top notch iced with some chocolate; it has a strong enough flavor but in a light roast so you don't get that burnt flavor, but it REALLY stood out with the chocolate flavor with it.  It seemed to be very low acid as well, it didn't eat at my stomach the way that the Sumatra coffee I had been drinking lately had.<br /><br />I'm still not sure if I can justify the price of the coffee for the flavor, but I suspect I will be back for more!  The more I write about it the more I want to go brew up a cup... and although it's 8:30 in the evening, it IS decaf, so I can, right? :D

review/summary: TASTES GREAT but overpriced
review/text: On one of my "we've got to start eating more healthy" days, I saw this product.  I, personally like brown rice, etc., but I have a family that for the most part thinks anything healthy doesn't taste good.  I ordered it and served it and everyone liked it.  Even my most staunch "I hate healthy food" critic, my teenaged son admitted he liked it.  My only complaint would be the price which I think is too high and when you add shipping it becomes a luxury item. Healthy, complete grains that haven't been processed should be cheaper than their processed counterparts, or at least closer in price.  It's so much cheaper to eat unhealthy.  Still if you want something good for you and tastes good, try this.

review/summary: Amazing, good tasting and healthy!
review/text: I've been eating Nishiki (?) jasmine white rice for many years, and thought I'd try this as it is healthier. I was very pleasantly surprised - it tasted great. I was concerned it wouldn't cook properly in my programmable Zojirushi 3 cup rice cooker but it comes out great on both the regular and quick cooking settings. (I haven't tried it in my bigger neurofuzzy cooker but assume it would be as good or better). It does seem a little more sensitive to amount of water than regular white rice - adding too much makes it mushier.<br /><br />I think it's the wheat and rye berries that make it delicious, so getting the brown/wild rice mix at Whole Foods and mixing in some wheat and rye berries would probably be just as tasty and less expensive.

review/text: I wish I could buy this rice blend in my local store.  RiceSelect Royal Blend rice is for those of us who like flavorful mixed grains, with the firmer consistency only possible with long cook rice.  The nutrition in this grain combo is phenomenal and the taste is fabulous.  I buy the 4 jar package and it comes out cheaper than if I could actually talk my grocer into carrying it.  The flavors complement a gumbo, spanish rice,  a bacon/ham and pecan casserole, or anything with a stronger flavor even oriental and indian dishes.  For milder dishes like Indian Butter Chicken, you might like your regular white, basmati, or jasmine rices, although I generally use these whole grains for almost everything.  Jars were package very well, packed for shipping very well, and shipped promptly.  Rice lovers will love this product.

review/summary: Say goodbye to boring, plain, white rice
review/text: Let me keep it short and to the point.  This rice is wonderful and I highly recommend it.  I use an automatic rice cooker so there is no work or guessing involved.  Put in 3 cups of rice, add water to the line, and 45 minutes later it is done perfectly.  I think what I like best about this rice is the texture.  It has a lot of "crunch" left in it after cooking.  The Soft Wheat & Rye Berries add to that crunchy texture as does the wild rice.  And this rice has a lot more flavor than plain, white rice.  We also know that this whole grain product is much more healthy for you than the plain white variety.  I have occasionally found this rice in some of the stores where I shop but far too often I search for it in vain.  Thankfully, I can count on Amazon to have this in stock!!!<br /><br />I also like the Rice Select Royal Blend with Brown & Red Rice with Pearled Barley & Rye Berries.  I alternate between these two varieties to keep things interesting.

review/text: This is a great blend for those who do not like just the brown rice by itself. It is also tasty when you cook it with salt and butter. I've also tried adding dried cranberries and peanuts to give it a different flavor...yummy! It is a healthier alternative over the regular white rice. Although it is pricier than regular white rice, buying it from Amazon in bulk reduces the cost per container. I've seen it in the standard markets for over $7 each. My only gripe about cooking brown rice is that it takes longer to cook than regular white rice. However, I do recommend this mix to anyone looking for a healthier way to eat!

review/summary: Never thought I'd be buying groceries from Amazon.com
review/text: My store stopped stocking this rice for some reason.  It is a far superior blend than anything else I've tried and so I Googled it and was surprised to find it here.  Great texture and flavor (I cook it in chicken stock).  The best thing about this rice is that it is ready to cook, no rinsing required.  With other rice blends it takes so long to rinse that sometimes it's not even worth the effort for little reward.  This rice has it all...flavor, texture and no rinsing.  A lazy cooks dream.

review/summary: Best Damn Rice in the World!
review/text: Updated (12/20/2011): When bought in bulk--pack of 4, Wegmans is 4 cents more expensive; *BUT* for the first time I signed up with Amazon's 'subscription' that takes off 15% when automatically ordering every 4 months, which I have found this to be very reasonable.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />Buy it from Wegmans (best grocery store according to Consumer Reports in the U.S., or the world); it's cheaper there.<br /><br />Also, this has less sugar, since it's whole grain.

review/summary: I want to give it 8 stars!
review/text: I usually do not like rice, and I have a husband who does. He has tried to feed me several types in the 7 years we have been together, to no avail. I do not like rice, I never have.<br /><br />That is, until he came home with THIS rice... I LOVE it, I need it, I want it every day... And, whatever sticks to the pot a little, or what is left over, we feed to the dog, and he is used to good stuff too.<br />The dog eats it with as much gusto as I do.<br />Our 10 year old son who would eat white pasta with ketchup if he were allowed loves this rice too.<br /><br />We won't buy any other anymore.<br /><br />It has tons of flavor, it has a bite, it is wholesome and nutritious. BUY it!

review/text: I'm going to have to go against everyone else's reviews here so far, because I found this rice to be both dry and very bland. It's certainly not delicious, and I was extremely disappointed, particularly because I bought it on the strength of the other reviews here.<br /><br />For those curious, I made this in my Zojirushi (made in Japan) rice cooker, which makes perfect rice every time.<br /><br />On the plus side, it certainly is healthy, and other people seem to like it, but I didn't at all.

review/summary: ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE, VERY DISAPPOINTING :-(
review/text: I love this time of the year (Autumn/Fall) and love the immense variety of pumpkin food products that are available.  To name a few: Pumpkin Ice Cream, Pumpkin Bread and Muffins, Pumpkin Pie, Pumpkin Spice Latte (coffee), Pumpkin Cheesecake, etc. etc.  I recently started adding canned pumpkin to our Sunday morning pancakes, and was delighted with the results; however, I wanted a stronger pumpkin taste/flavor.  I found this product and excitedly ordered two bottles.  It arrived very quickly (within 3 days), and I just tried it this morning in our pancakes.  The flavor DOES NOT taste like pumpkin whatsoever.  It tastes like a chemical and leaves a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  I dumped both bottles down the sink and had to throw away the pancakes.  I was not able to eat them, they were terrible.  I was actually nauseated after trying to eat them.  I'm not a picky eater and have no allergies whatsoever.  I'm the type of person that will eat nearly everything, and cannot think of any food that I don't like.  I'm going to continue my search for a "NATURAL" TRUE pumpkin extract; however, this is definitely not it.  I hope this helps you, especially if you're as passionate about pumpkin flavor as I am. Happy Holidays to You and Yours.  Sincerely, Tim

review/text: I am so excited Amazon sells this!My husband brought this coffee, among others, back from a backpacking trip to Costa Rica. By far this is my favorite. It is complex, nutty with a toasty, chocolate like finish. It is not too dark, does not have that burned bean Starbucks taste, and has a nice body and mouth feel. I am very picky about coffee and like Kenya AA, Kona and Costa Rica Tazzaru. If you like any of these, you might like this coffee too.

review/summary: Beats Jennies Coconut Macaroons!
review/text: I have been a bit disappointed with one of my favorite snacks the last year or two- Jennies Coconut Macaroons.  For some reason they just have not been as good as I have experienced for the last decade or more that we have enjoyed them. I was disappointed as so many companies have compromised the original purpose of making non sugar laden snacks, including using carob in place of chocolate.<br /><br />Jennies used to have both- using honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />Well, this past Christmas I got a package of Oskri Coconut bars.  I was not sure what to expect as the ingredient list is pretty simple- Brown Rice Syrup and Coconut!<br /><br />When i opened the first bar, it was complete excitement.  These bars are DELICIOUS.<br /><br />Not as overwhelmingly sweet like Jennies, these have a delicious sweetness that is subtle but fulfilling.  The bars are wrapped and very easy to eat.  Moistness is wonderful and the flavor is delightfully simple!<br /><br />I liked these so much that not only did I end up getting a subscription of them, but I found out my mother did so too!<br /><br />These are wonderful simple bars if you want a nice snack that is not overly sweet yet satisfying.  I highly recommend them.

review/text: These bars are just the right balance between the flavor of the coconut & the sweetness of the rice syrup. Unfortunately, although the expiration date is in 2013, about a third of mine went bad, or perhaps started life that way. They had a funny, metallic taste, & one even had some black substance on it, which may or may not have been mold. I'm wondering if refrigerating would have prevented this. I highly recommend these bars, but beware of the keeping quality!

review/text: My 17 yr old son loves these.  He eats the entire box of bars in two weeks.  Literally.  I like them too, but they rarely last long enough in the house for me to get one.  Chewy, just sweet enough, yum.  Kiddo is gluten free and refined sugar free and these are among his favorite snacks.  I love that they give Mr. 5% Body Fat with the metabolism of, well, a 17 year old boy, enough carbs to get through his school day (33g) in a form that is convenient enough for him to eat between classes.  Lunch alone is not enough, he has to eat between classes.  Yes, I know, if I could get some more protein into his snacks that would stick with him longer, but I also have to send what he will eat, and he eats these, whereas the other bars came back home.  Also, buying in bulk like this is a significantly better price than buying from the co-op.

review/summary: A Favorite Snack!
review/text: I have been consuming these coconut bars for several months now after having purchased a small box at HomeGoods. These bars are delicious! They taste like the inside of a Mounds Bar. Only 2 ingredients: shredded coconut & rice syrup. I have purchased the 20 pack box through Amazon a few times. One of the latest boxes contained bars that tasted odd. They were darker in color and did not have the fresh coconut taste I was used to. Perhaps they were in a delivery truck that was hot and the oil in the coconut started to go rancid? Anyway, I contacted the company (Oskri) and their quality department was great. They provided a return shipping label for the unconsumed bars and shipped out a brand new box of 20 bars plus some additional samples to try. I have read some other reviewers that said they didn't like the taste of the bars. It's too bad they didn't try to contact the company because I'm sure they would have sent out a replacement product. I did notice though that the nutrition information has changed even though the weight & contents of the bar are the same. The calories, fat & sugar have all increased (180 cals vs. 246 cals, 11 grams vs. 14 grams, 14 grams vs. 29 grams). That is unfortunate, and I will have to cut down on my consumption. However, these bars really do taste yummy! They are soft, chewy, sweet & fresh. My husband and I love them, and I have gotten a few friends hooked on them too!

I think the shipper did not ship them properly based upon the heat of the summer.  When I took them out of the box they were really warm.<br />Even my children who love most things wont eat them.  So either this is a terrible product or the company shipped these in the heat of the summer and it changed them.

review/summary: Meh
review/text: Not impressed at all.  I guess if you are vegan or hippie then you might enjoy these, but to be honest, they are almost bland tasting and I am stuck with 19 more.  1 gram of protein? I wasn't buying these for the protein content, but seriously, 1 gram and they are gonna brag about it on the package?  Having lived in Thailand for a few years, I really miss good tasting coconut and not these impostor "healthy" coconut bars or overpriced coconut water drinks.  Not even sure why I'm giving them two stars, except maybe because of their box and hyped up packaging.<br /><br />**Updated** After a few more bars, they seem to taste better.  The first one I had looked yellow and I noticed some small oily stains on the box in which they come in.  The rest have been white and have taste.  Therefore, I am assuming the first one I ate that sucked, the packaging was not sealed properly and air was allowed in and oil out.  I've decided to not be so harsh on the grade now after consuming a few more bars.

The chocolate coating is thinner than a mounds bar, but perfect balance for the taste of the coconut. I often only eat half of one these at a time.

A careful review of the contents of the Hershey's Mounds Bar :NGREDIENTS: CORN SYRUP; SEMI-SWEET CHOCOLATE ( CHOCOLATE; SUGAR; COCOA; MILK FAT; COCOA BUTTER; SOY LECITHIN; PGPR, EMULSIFIER) ; COCONUT; SUGAR; SALT; NATURAL & ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR; HYDROLYZED MILK PROTEIN; SODIU, M METABISULFITE, TO MAINTAIN FRESHNESS; SULFUR DIOXIDE, TO MAINTAIN FRESHNESS; CARAMEL COLOR; MILK  followed by  the contents of the Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar<br /><br />Ingredients: Coconuts, Rice Syrup, Dark Chocolate (Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Chocolate, Soy Lecithin, Natural Vanilla)<br />clearly<br />exemplifies the purity & quality of the product.<br /><br />Though the visual is not as attractive as the Mounds Bar, the absence of garbage ingredients makes the contents of the Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar  far more nutritious, &  its taste far superior. Any time I find myself licking the wrapper,  it's an Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar!  I seriously try to eat only one a day.  I say try!

review/text: I agree with the other reviewers that the chocolate can be a tad crumbly, but this only occurred with my first order, and the taste of these bars is still absolutely AMAZING!!<br /><br />These bars are gluten free, have three basic ingredients (coconut, rice syrup, dark chocolate), and are a wonderful treat that I don't feel terrible after eating.  Try a box and you'll soon find out how incredibly delicious they are.

review/summary: Not better than Mounds
review/text: I only rated this item as a 4 star because it is not Dark Chocolate as the label says. It's more like a darker Milk Chocolate. I happen to love "Dark" Chocolate.<br /><br />This bar gets the 4 because since I am a recovering sugar addict it is just right for me today because I am being good. I don't think I will purchase this item again because it is not Dark Chocolate, which is what I love.  I will go back to the SunSpire Dark Chocolate Coconut bars because I don't want to feel deprived and their bars are truly Dark Chocolate and Coconut!!!!  I have cut out over 90% of sugar in my diet and I these bars will be my reward.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006K02VJC">Oskri Coconut Bar, Original with Dark Chocolate, 1.9-Ounce (Pack of 20)</a><br />In spots the covering has a whitish look. I don't know whether that is because it traveled across California during a heat wave or because the bars are old. The company needs to adjust/edit their label to be accurate.<br /><br />10:50p.m.<br />Update - I have decided to return this product for a refund. Oskri charges more for Dark Chocolate than for their regular Coconut Bar. I did not feel it was right for them to charge extra for Dark Chocolate when that is not what they deliver. They may not even have a Dark Chocolate Bar, judging by what they shipped to me. It is Milk Chocolate. Anyone who sees these bars will immediately know they are Milk and not Dark Chocolate.<br /><br />I am very disappointed since I no longer eat Milk Chocolate. I am totally addicted to Dark Chocolate.<br /><br />Update 4/25/2012<br />I was wrong about the Chocolate. I opened a second bar and it was Dark Chocolate. I believe some of the bars were melted during the time the package traveled across California during a heat wave. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone loving coconut and Dark chocolate.

review/summary: Disappointed with this box of bars
review/text: The concept is good. I love the plain/original Oskri coconut bars. They have a nice texture. I like Mounds and wanted a slightly healthier version. These could be that, but this box was way below quality. It seems like it is old because most of the bars I have tried have discolored chocolate and the coconut is dried out. One of the bars even had a bad seal so that I didn't even have to rip it open and it was completely dried out. The plain bars are not dry at all, so these really did not meet the standards I was expecting. Won't buy these again, but that is probably best because the sugar content is high, even though it is superior to corn syrup.

review/summary: Fruit, brownies, and meat?
review/text: What do fruit, brownies, and meat have in common? Yep the answer is they all go amazingly well with this chile lime seasoning. Sprinkling this stuff on top of wip cream is also a surprizing treat. Its great in a brownie batter, and is a wonderfull marinade for grillables. Its also perfect if you need to add a tart zing to a dish without adding any liquid. Toss french fries, chips, or any other fried foods immediately in this seasoning, after it comes out of the oil. It adds the acid that fried foods so desperately need, while still keeping them crispy. Who wants to mush up the batter with lime juice, well I use to, but not anymore?<br /><br />This seasoning will make you explore the boundaries of savory and sweet combinations (since it labeled itself a fruit seasoning), some will be delightful and others will be horrible failures. However, the experiences you will gain and the palette lessons you will learn from this magical seasoning are priceless.I liked the 8 pack because I saved on shipping with the amazon prime discount and also got to hand out 6 of them as gifts/party favors.

review/summary: Remarkable, Best Seasoning for Everything!
review/text: I was recently in Mexico where I sampled this for the first time.  Not quite sure why I'd never tried it before as I go there every year...but, WOW, this was an eye opener.  It's all the best flavors of the Yucatan in a bottle!  Lime, chili (but not too much) and salt, with a few others thrown in for good measure.  It's tangy, zippy, salty and wicked good on almost anything.  We roasted chicken with it, put it on the guacamole, stirred it into black beans and even used it to rim Margarita glasses.  I'd call it the best seasoning ever.

review/summary: Addicting!
review/text: Lived in California for several years and was introduced to Tajin via Mexican cuisine.  I used to limit only to fruit, I loved especially on apples, pineapples, and watermelon.  After moving to the midwest I couldn't find in any store (I now live a very small town.)  So spoiled being able to buy at Walmart or Target when we lived in Cali! I ordered via Amazon and thought an 8 pack would be too much.  But after reading reviews here I was convinced to go beyond fruit and sprinkle onto savory items.  WOW, all the reviews were right, I literally use this on almost everything now!  I love it on pizza, sandwhices, spaghetti, chili, beef stew, mac and cheese, steamed veggies, it really adds that extra "oomph"!  I introduced co-workers to it and gave two of them one bottle each and now they're hooked, too!  I leave a bottle in our common kitchen at work and pretty much use it daily at lunch.  The 8 pack is a great deal and received lightning-fast with my Amazon Prime membership.  Thank you so much, Amazon, for making this available!

review/summary: A hit with friends as a gift
review/text: A close friend who loves great food and seasonings introduced us to this seasoning, and we fell in love with it.  It takes fruit to a new level for your taste buds, and almost everything tastes better with the lime, chile pepper flavor.  It's not too spicy for those who are not chile heads -- but gives food a 'pop' and 'zing' we like.<br />We had a casual evening with other friends and brought along our personal bottle for a dish we planned to share.  They flipped over Tajine too and immediately began trying to find it in their home state, Colorado!  After hearing that they had been unsuccessful, we shipped a small case to them as a surprise gift -- and it was a hit.  It keeps well in the pantry and is a delightful lift when slicing an apple for an afternoon snack.  Can you tell we like it?

review/summary: They have definitely changed things!
review/text: I used to drink Crystal Light over 10 years ago.  The choices were minimal:  Tea, tea with lemon, lemonade and pink lemonade.  At my job we have an area set up so employees can buy snacks and this variety pack.  Tired of soda, I opted to try the Crystal Light On the Go Wild Strawberry-Energy.  I instantly LOVED it.  This is coming from a person who really doesn't care for strawberries.<br /><br />Unlike another poster I didn't find it too strong.  I DO find the Cherry Pomegranate a tad powerful, but still yummy.  The last two-lemonade and raspberry lemonade- are also delicious.<br /><br />Having tried the Wild Strawberry at work I thought I'd see if Amazon had it and it did.  While I know purchasing an item this way is more expensive per serving, I prefer it this way.  When I make a pitcher of a drink I tend to get tired of it and it ends up going down the drain.  Now THAT is a waste of money!<br /><br />If you like Crystal Light then I'm pretty sure you'll like these flavors.  None of them are my favorite (I prefer fruit punch and pink lemonade) but I really like this product.

I make sure my water is absolutely cold before I mix in the crystal light and it is SOOOOO refreshing. My favorite is the wild strawberry. It reminds me of the strawberries my mom used to grow.

review/text: I ordered this product because I have enjoyed Crystal Light since it first came on the scene. I was really looking forward to enjoying all the packettes of drink. I have high blood pressure and imagine my dismay when I discovered the Strawberry (which I was very much anticipating) was an "energy" drink with caffiene added. I had always relied upon Crystal Light because I did not have to worry about getting ingredients which would be harmful to my health, however if I had not noticed the caffiene in the packettes and drank them my blood pressure would have shot up and I could have had ill effects from it. I threw all the Strawberry packettes in the trash so I did not feel I got the value that I paid for because in the discription there was nothing about caffiene.

review/summary: Nice assortment of flavors ...
review/text: I purchased this tub as a way to try out some new Crystal Light flavors.  I was told I had to cut back on caffeine, and I don't need the calories associated with sugared soft drinks.  These work well, for the most part.<br /><br />My favorite flavor is the raspberry lemonade.  I like the hint of raspberry flavor, and find that I can drink quite a lot of it during the day without getting bored.  I mix up a 32-oz water bottle of the stuff, using 2 packets of mix.  This seems to work well, especially when i down 2-3 bottles of the stuff per day.<br /><br />I also like the lemonade flavor, and the cherry pomegranate.  The strawberry - not so much.  It's their "energy" formulation, so it contains some "extras" that I think add to a slightly bitter "sharp" flavor - and it contains caffeine, which sort of defeats the purpose of my drinking Crystal Light in the first place.<br /><br />I've managed to lose 23 pounds in a little over 3 months using this along with cooking everything from "scratch" - no processed foods, lots of fruits and veggies, fresh meats and fish.  I do understand the controversy about aspartame, but given the choice between carrying WAY too much weight and consuming something that may or may not kill me eventually, I'll choose the latter.  Plain water just doesn't do it for me, and this stuff IS tasty.

Sugar is not harmless either, for some of us.  I can't afford the sugar and calories in real fruit juices as a beverage choice more than once a day.<br /><br />Crystal Light "Natural" Leomonade flavor is delicious.  What I don't understand is why all of the other flavors have a bad aftertaste.  I suppose it must have something to do with the  tartness of the lemon-like flavor that disguises it.<br /><br />"Natural" Lemonade: aside from the ridiculous use of one of big fake food's favorite BS terms, "natural" (good grief, just look at the ingredients list!), this, for my taste, is the best Crystal Light flavor.  Though it's not what most people would consider natural, it does "taste" remarkably like real lemonade. However, I do use nearly twice the amount of powder and loads of crushed ice to get that taste.<br /><br />Raspberry Lemonade: Artificial tasting, slight bad aftertaste, you can improve this by adding half a real squeezed lemon. This used to taste better, but about a year ago it changed.  It still has less of the aftertaste than most of the other flavors.<br /><br />Wild Strawberry: Too fake tasting and terrible, strong, bitter, fake sugar aftertaste.  Almost as bad  as saccharine.<br /><br />Cherry Pomegranate: ditto<br /><br />My final complaint is the cost. I think there's a good deal of corporate greed involved here. I imagine the profit margin is astronomical. (Yeah, I know, I don't "have" to buy it.  They don't "have" to be greedy ba$t@rd$ either.)

review/summary: Bitter
review/text: I'll admit I'm a coffee snob. I drink only organic, and I grind my own beans w/ a burr grinder.  I only bought this coffee ground because my husband isn't quite as picky as I am and doesn't want to be bothered grinding the beans every time he wants a cup (We drink a lot of coffee---going through about 2 lbs. a week).  I love my coffee REALLY strong, but there's a difference between rich, strong coffee and bitter coffee, and this coffee unfortunately falls into the latter category.  I took a chance w/ this one, and although the first time I had it, it seemed "okay," the second time, it was just bitter and with a weird aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm finding it more and more difficult to get a decent coffee at a decent price. Lately, every coffee I get is either stale tasting or bitter.  I would love to find a decent, whole-bean organic coffee that is freshly roasted and that doesn't cost more than $10 a lb.  Any suggestions, anyone?

review/summary: Holistic Select Dog Food - EXCELLENT!
review/text: We switched to this dog food after our 12 yr old mixed breed dog started losing weight and developed severe dermatitis, itching, scratching and shedding! For 12 yrs, we had been giving her a name brand dry product we purchased at local pet stores.  She is a completely different dog these days!  She has gained back all her weight, is happy, and does not itch,scratch or shed.  I HIGHLY recommend this dog food!  It is made of natural, good ingredients.

review/summary: Great dog food for dogs with allergies
review/text: We have giant breed dogs who are allergic to corn, wheat, and soy.  This food is perfect and even better that I can now buy it on-line instead of going to specialty dog food stores around town.

review/text: Honestly, it's good food. My dog eats 1/4 of a can with each meal (mixed with kibble) and he loves it. He's a 3-year-old male Ridgeback, and he looks great. He's healthy, has a nice coat, and eats well.

review/summary: Plantabulous!
review/text: Beautiful plants, great value, well cared for and packaged perfectly. The only thing I would include in the future is care instructions. I'd like to know how they are cared for by the seller so that I can continue the care at home. Some people mist these plants while others soak them in a bowl of water; which method do these prefer? I will be making this my exclusive go to guy/gal for ordering these plants and others in the future. Super impressed! Thank you.

review/summary: No better creamer out there
review/text: I am addicted to this stuff. Price wise, I can buy this at WalMart for $3.50 a package, and using coupons I can get that down to $2.50 a bottle. So now I just buy 6 or so at WalMart when I start running low. I have bought a hundred of these and they are always in good condition with no lumps and alway filled completely. What can I say about a creamer except I love the taste!

review/text: I've never tasted a creamer I've enjoyed as much as the Coffee-Mate Vanilla Caramel Creamer. It makes every cup of coffee I drink seem like a special treat. It doesn't take a whole lot of this creamer to get a whole lot of flavor. I love it!

review/summary: Vanilla caramel Coffee-mate is TOPS in my book !!!
review/text: Vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate makes for an excellent milk or cream substitute for people who want a cup of coffee, cocoa or even tea when they don't have access to a refrigerator to keep milk or cream on hand. Coffee-mate therefore comes in very handy in many workplaces, naturally, but it adds so much extra flavor to your beverage that you just might wind up using this instead of milk or cream even if you do have access to a refrigerator with milk or cream in it!<br /><br />Coffee-mate is easy enough to use--just add three or four teaspoons full of it into your cup of coffee, tea or whatever beverage you want to sweeten with this wonderful vanilla caramel taste.<br /><br />I would use vanilla caramel Coffee-mate by the expiration date on the bottom of the plastic container; and the container gives you simple instructions for turning this powdery substance into liquid just in case you want to do that.<br /><br />The nutrition label claims it contains no trans-fats but I notice that it contains partially hydrogenated oils. This may indicate that the trans-fats in Coffee-mate are present but very negligible.<br /><br />Have further questions? Just give them a call or surf on over to their website. They provide you with the website address and a toll free number if you have more questions about vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate.<br /><br />Overall, vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate provides an excellent, sweet tasting substitute for milk, cream and anything else that contains lactose. You may want to use it to sweeten your coffee, tea or cocoa even if you have access to fresh refrigerated milk that you can use. It's THAT good.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!
