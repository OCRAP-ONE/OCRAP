review/summary: Taste's like.... Water.
review/text: Essentia Drinking Water tastes like (drumroll please) clean, filtered (public RO) drinking water.  Having used an alkaline gadget with my water in the past, I expected it to have more of a slightly different "flavor", but that wasn't the case.  It tastes like water.<br /><br />But taste isn't everything.  The bottle boasts of a silkiness to the water within the bottle.<br /><br />The silkiness made this less refreshing for me and I, frankly, avoided the rest of the bottle for a day and tried it again and still, the mouth feel made it seem like a thicker beverage with some sort of starch in it.  According to the label of the bottle I have on hand, there is no starch, but still it feels that way.  Like cornstarch- soft, silky, but not something I would seek out in my quest for hydration.  The silkiness killed it for me and sent me in pursuit of a bottle of Smart Water.  (Note:  please read the other reviews.  The silkiness might not be an issue for everyone, but I am very sensitive to texture and flavor variations. This might be a non-issue for you. YMMV)

review/summary: Taste is perfectly fine, don't know about the PH thing
review/text: This water has a nice taste and the bottle is nice and sturdy to hold. What else to say about this water? Oh yes, the PH. I did not feel any different after drinking this water than I do after drinking any other water. It did absolutely nothing to even try to blow my socks off, and the asking price is too high for it to be so mediocre. This water didn't come from some rare source so the price tag is unwarranted. So why the 4 stars? Because it tastes like good water, as it's supposed to. If it were sold for the same price as Sam's Club water then I'd buy it.  Also, I think I'll stick to Gatorade as opposed to expensive filtered tap water when I need electrolytes.

review/summary: Love the taste.  Other issues??
review/text: First, I'll discuss what I like most about this bottled water (the taste), then address some of the other issues I read from other reviewers:<br /><br />I love the taste.  Most bottled waters taste like most tap waters . . . bland. I have preferred Dasani (by Coca-Cola Co) due to its light mineral additive package which gives it a pleasing taste.  Likewise with this Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water. Very pleasant taste. No taste negatives and in my judgement, no aftertaste.<br /><br />I like the 1.5 liter size in the durable smooth clear bottle.  2 liter bottles are a little too big for packing around.  Other smaller sizes are often not very economical, or because of limited size require carrying more than one bottle.  This 1.5 liter weighs about 3 pounds when full and is a nice size in my estimation.<br /><br />The price is admittedly higher than the no-name bargain bottled waters, but neither is this Perrier-priced, and I do not find the price to be excessive for a quality, tailored water.<br /><br />I really can't speak much to the "magic elixer" claims regarding the pH. If I did, I think I'd be just making stuff up. I do, however, experience some infrequent heartburn, usually depending on what I've eaten. I had no such digestive problems after drinking the Essentia 9.5 pH. Maybe coincidence, or maybe the water helps. The idea of a basic pH water to balance an excessively acidic stomach situation has some merit. It would take longer for me to develop a more sure opinion.<br /><br />I like this water. I'd be willing to buy it regularly.

review/summary: Good Water But I'm Not Convinced it's Worth the Price
review/text: According to the Mayo Clinic, insufficient research exists to support manufacturer claims of any health benefits from drinking alkaline water.  Furthermore, the Mayo Clinic also disputes claims that bottled water is superior to tap water.<br /><br />That being said, I drink bottled water because I prefer carbonated to flat water.  So taste certainly has an influence on what kind of water to drink and any water is preferable to soft drinks.<br /><br />I couldn't detect any difference in the taste but my daughter and grandson (both with ADD) could.  They preferred the clean taste of Essentia to our well water but didn't find it to be significantly better than our filtered tap water.<br /><br />If the claimed benefits are scientifically to be true, then it may be worth the purchase price.  But individual testimony (anecdotal evidence) isn't enough to convince me.

review/summary: Good water, wins local taste test, but just barely.
review/text: This water is good, it is possibly the best tasting of the water we had in our taste test which included several well knows brands, grocery store distilled and filtered, as well as in home reverse osmosis. But this was a side by side comparison. All the water we tasted is exceptional on its own.<br /><br />I don't personally believe any health benefits, the small difference in pH from other water seems it would quickly be equalized in the acid digestive environment.<br /><br />I did find some change in baking but it was not a improvement, the high ph seemed to interfere with yeast and pizza dough did not form a quality skin as if the gluten formation was negatively impacted.<br /><br />Conclusion, the water is good, but seems expensive without any appreciable advantage.

review/text: These candies are hoppy without being bitter.  They satisfy the craving for a sweet, hard candy, but add a wonderful kick of hops, as in a hoppy beer (a la Sierra Nevada Pale Ale) giving them a wonderful semi-tart, slight "grapefruit" style flavor.  I have put them out on a candy dish for company, and everyone loves them, gushing "what are these?" and "these are great!"  Everyone wants to know where to get them, so I direct them to the beercandy.com website, where you can easily order them, along with their other wonderfully beer-flavored (real beer, yet no alcohol) chocolates.  My favorite of these is the Dark Chocolate Lambic...ooooooohhhh lala!  Great for gifts!

Once I had a bad batch (turns out that the lot was missing an ingredient which made them super dry) and contacted both the company and Amazon.  Amazon refunded my money and the company sent me a new box, in 2 day, that was great and both Oskri and Amazon were very apologetic.

review/summary: Nice taste and lighter on sugar than some
review/text: I ordered a box of these with a bit of trepidation as I had tried the coconut mango and found it was loaded with sugar and light on mango, but a great coconut taste.  Not exactly food for a diabetic.  This one both tastes good and has a much lower sugar content.  It is generously filled with cranberries and nuts so it is a satisfying snack.  The crispy binder is different, but actually a nice complement to the fruits and nuts.  The bar doesn't feel overly processed like some protein bars.  It actually feels as if it were homemade, which is nice.  Its a bit sticky, but not gooey.  These are good enough that you always risk wanting more, but you just gotta stop yourself as they are not low in calories.

review/summary: These are sooo good! -- but....
review/text: This is an add-on to my recent review...<br />I do like these bars, but in the news recently there has been a lot of talk about high levels of arsenic in rice, particularly rice syrup. Unfortunately, the first ingredient in these bars is just that. I emailed Oskri, and while they were extremely quick in replying to my first email to them asking about their sugar ingredient as indicated in my post below, they have never replied to my inquery about the rice syrup and what, if any, testing had been done. So, until they do that, I will stop purchasing (and eating) this product.<br /><br />I have tried almost every type of protein bar there is. Normally, they have a ton of added sugar. (I am a label reader...) I bought my first Oskri bar in a local Health Food store -- a fiber bar. I was surprised that the ingredients didn't say "sugar," yet it had a sugar content. So, I was curious and checked with the company to see what exactly was holding it together and what the sugar was -- chickory root. Someone actually figured out how to make a completely natural product?? I then had to find what other flavors they had. The almond and cranberries are my favorite. Nothing else can compete! I am buying them by the box now (thank you, Amazon!).<br /><br />I also bought the fig bars. I made the mistake of not checking the ingredients first, though. But, was pleasantly surprised to find that the bars were 100% fig. That is unheard of! How more natural can you get?? If you like Fig Newtons, you will love the figs.-- They just don't have the dough wrapper! And, they come in a mini size, which are perfect and hit the spot. Great job Oskri

review/summary: Pretty good...
review/text: I was impressed by how quickly the jerky arrived, and the free sample (1.75 oz of teriyaki beef jerky) was great!  The venison jerky was pressed and formed into rectangular strips and was fattier than I expected.  It had a very oily/greasy feel when I left it at room termperature.  One of the ingredients in this jerky was Monosodium glutamate (MSG), which is the subject of a health concern controversy.  I would definitely order from this company again, but I will not be purchasing this venison jerky again.

I was pleasantly surprised by how very good it is... moist and tasty with a rich hickory smoke flavor. Even the hunters in the family enjoyed this one! The 7" strips are the perfect size for a healthy and satisfying snack too. Low carbs, low calories and good taste - I know I'll order these again. I can always count on Choo Choo R Snacks for quality products, quick shipping and excellent customer service.

review/summary: Wondeful flavor
review/text: This is a wonderfully flavored jerky.  It's a fairly smokey flavor with maybe a hint of soy sauce flavor along with the natural flavor of the venison.  It is a bit expensive compared to let's say their "country cut" line of beef jerky, but well worth trying at least once.<br /><br />I do enjoy their "Country Cut Teriyaki" flavor a bit more, but this one is still worth the five stars, and will be something I order when the Teriyaki flavor doesn't appeal to me at the moment.  For the record the Teriyaki has a fairly strong soy sauce flavor, with some smokey flavor, a hint of something else I haven't placed yet (Onion perhaps?) and a very slight sweet flavor.  I've also had the Barbeque flavor via a free sample they sent with my last order (I've placed two orders with them so far, and they always so far send a small sample pack up and beyond the normal order) and although I enjoyed the Teriyaki and this flavor more, the BBQ is very much worth trying at least once as well, the BBQ sauce flavor was very nice and smokey/sweet.<br /><br />The only product I felt wasn't quite up to the same level of quality so far was their mild "short shot" beef sausages.  They weren't bad, and I did rate them four stars but I didn't enjoy them quite as much as the jerky products by them I tried.  I'd suggest just getting a small sample of their snack sausages to try first before placing a large order.

review/text: I got this tea to have the 'STANDARD' tea, not just the celtic breakfast tea.  Its fine, not as strong as I would have expected, goes slightly bitter if overbrewed.  All in all, I prefer just about all the other teas from this brand, this one was ho hum.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Unlike the other "Think!" products, this one is smaller, has a bland taste, and has a partial sugar coating. This is the first product I've bought from them that I regret purchasing. It's particularly disappointing since the company is supposedly using this product to raise money for cancer research. If you're going to sell one of your products to benefit people with cancer, it's adding insult to injury to choose one of your worst products.

review/summary: Easily my favorite snack cracker. Mmm Pepper-Jack!
review/text: These crackers have tons of flavor and just enough kick. They are very crispy which is nice. What I really like about these is that the flavor is in the cracker itself, not a powder they coat the crackers with (like many other flavors). I can't stand the flavor powder, it gets all over your hands and makes the crackers less crispy. These are crispy and not greasy. They really are a great snack (& highly addictive, I can down a box VERY FAST) and the real cheese flavor is very apparent. Highly recommended... I only wish I could buy these in bulk via Amazon Prime... Till then, Wally*World will be my place to buy.

review/summary: Wholesome Raw food without any fluff
review/text: OK...if you're looking for pure flavor, this is not the kale chip for you. There is no flavor "fluff." If, however, you are searching for a wholesome, raw food sans other foods used as flavor enhancers that may cause a digestive problem or exacerbate inflammation (i.e., the nightshades), then this is the chip for you. This is not for the faint at heart when it comes to flavor as there is a predominant vinegar taste. It has a strong, raw flavor that reminds you you're eating something pure and simple. I happen to love them and find my self craving them! Great job, Kaia!

review/text: I am obsessed with kale chip lately so I thought I would try these. They were inedible. I was so dissapointed. I could do wonderous things with Kale Chips but apparently Kaia missed the mark. What I didn't know when I ordered them is that they were topped with what tasted like bird seeds. I tried to give the bag away to several visitors but no one would take them!!! They left a terrible taste in my mouth. The only good thing is that they sent me a free apple fruit roll like they knew they had to make up for the chips.

review/summary: barely tolerable
review/text: I was excited to find the Kaia chips, because normally I make my own kale chips and it's somewhat time-consuming. Maybe my homemade chips have spoiled me, but these are just not pleasant at all.<br />First of all, it's not leaves (which I understand would be fragile to package), it's like leaves thrown in a blender to make a green paste that's then dried and cut into circles. It has sesame seeds and sunflower seeds on top.<br />And the flavor (so far tried "cheesy" and "sea salt & vinegar"), well, I can swallow them without getting nauseated, but that's about it. Won't be having them again.<br />I will say in their favor that it's relatively healthy (if high in fat), so compared to potato chips these are better for you. But for satisfying a yen for something yummy -- which my homemade kale chips definitely do -- these are disappointing. And expensive.

review/summary: Best raw chips
review/text: Kaia kale chips are not for everyone. Raw food tastes different from processed food so many people who are used to processed food will not find raw chips tasty.<br />In addition, kale in general has a very specific taste that some may find unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable (bitter).<br /><br />But if you appreciate raw food and like kale these chips are for you. They taste great and they are crisp.<br />The only downside is the price but it must be fairly expensive to prepare raw and organic food.

If your taste buds are no longer desensitized by typical, non-organic, junk food then these will delight your palate. Each chip is like taking a shot of delightfully healthy, nutrient-packed kale along with a variety of flavors (the sea salt/vinegar is my favorite).<br /><br />Do not believe the negative reviews!!<br /><br />Now, I just need to find out how to order these in bulk..

She weighs about 20 pounds and one of these 3" bones will occupy her for an entire night and at least part of the next day.<br /><br />Hartz calls these chews "Dentist's Best" because the raw hide has been coated with a chemical called Hexametaphosphate which is supposed to block tartar formation on the dog's teeth and freshen the breath. This ingredient was developed by researchers at Indiana University's School of Dentistry specifically for dogs.<br /><br />These bones, manufactured in Brazil, contain the following ingredients: Beefhide, Maltodextrin, Gluco-Delta-Lactone, Sodium Hexametaphosphate, and Natural and Artificial Flavors.<br /><br />A significant benefit of these treats is that they do not stain, splinter or leave a gummy mess. They sort of slowly disolve as they are licked and chewed.<br /><br />They also come in a smaller, 2" size <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OX6JDU">Hartz Dentist'S Best 10Pk 2In.

review/text: I bought the madagascar vanilla beans for a creme brulee recipe that I wanted to make. I was skeptical before buying them because of how affordable they were compared to the vanilla beans I found at grocery stores like whole foods & fresh market ($10 for 2 vanilla beans!). However, once they arrived I was more than satisfied with my purchase. They came in an sealed airless bag but the vanilla smell was so strong you could even smell it before opening the bag. I'm very satisfied with the super fast shipping thanks to Amazon and the excellent quality and price of the vanilla beans.

review/summary: Poor Quality
review/text: I have bought vanilla beans for several years for making homemade ice cream.  I always buy from Amazon because the supermarket vanilla beans are usually old and expensive.  I just received my order of these and was very disappointed.  The beans were stiff, not pliable as a good vanilla bean should be.  They did not have an oily feel to them, which is another sign of quality and freshness.  Also, there were less of the seeds that you get from the inside of the bean, which is where most of the flavor comes from, compared to previous purchases I have made. Finally, they did not have a very strong vanilla aroma - no where near as strong as other vanilla beans that I have bought in the past.<br /><br />I just used beans from the last order I bought (well over a year ago) along with these vanilla beans that I just ordered.  The old ones were MUCH better in quality than these new ones despite being quite a bit older.  I always vacuum seal the beans after I use them to help keep their freshness, but the other vanilla beans are still well over a year older than these new ones and were far better in quality.

review/summary: Wow!!!
review/text: I've been making my own vanilla extract for more than 20 years, obtaining my vanilla beans from various sources.  When I needed more vanilla beans, I checked Amazon and was amazed at the price for 1/4 pound of vanilla beans. It was less than I paid 20 years ago.  I ordered and hoped for the best and was extremely surprised and happy when they came.  The beans were soft and extremely fragrant.  Now, my vanilla extract is ready for use and the smell is beyond what I could have hoped for. In fact, all my previous batches now seem inferior to me. The fragrance of my extract makes me want to swoon. I would definitely recommend this product.

review/text: I haven't even used them yet, I've only had them 5 minutes. They were so stinky (in a great way) that another package it got delivered with even smelled like vanilla. Smelling inside the bag itself is actually overwhelming, I do not recommend it. They also came in a nice resealable bag. I will keep that inside an airtight container. These also arrived crazy fast - ordered them on a Friday right before a holiday weekend and got them Tuesday. I'm actually surprised the drug sniffing dogs don't freak out on these in the mail.

review/text: I received my vanilla beans within days of ordering.  They smelled so good, even from the package.  Although I haven't used them yet, I'm looking forward to making creme brulee with them.  The price for these beans was fantastic.  In stores, you usually pay about $10-12 for a bottle of two.  Before I purchased these beans, I couldn't even find them in a major grocery store.  I'm thrilled to have them, and I plan to use this vendor again.<br /><br />Great service!  Great product!

review/text: I was really pleased with the quality of these vanilla beans. They were well packaged, plump and aromatic. I will be using the bulk of them to make homemade vanilla extract, but having filled my booze bottles with 12 beans apiece, I still have 5 left over...so I ended up with 29 beans. Compared to the grocery store, an enormous savings! If you're on the fence, give them a shot- plus, there were coupons included for $$ off your next order!

I keep them in the ziplock baggie that it came with in a air-tight glass container and it is still fresh.  I would not recommend buying them at full price as they are a bit expensive.  Also, [...] started carrying vanilla beans so it you can, buy it there for less.

review/summary: INCREDIBLE!
review/text: I received my beans in a day because I live in Boston and the company is located in Charlestown. I've ordered from Olive Nation (JR Mushrooms and Specialties) several times and have yet to be disappointed. This time was no different. The beans were so plump, juicy and beautifully fragrant. I couldn't be happier with them or more excited to use them. Look forward to doing business with them again. Oh, and the price! You're not going to find better. With the 20 percent off coupon code, they're 12 dollars on their website and you still get free shipping! I'll buy more beans today with the code. Only down side is that I used to be able to find Tahitian Vanilla through them as well, but there seems to be some kind of a shortage or problem with getting them from, not just olive nation, but a lot of places now. Not their fault at all. I was just saddened about not being able to find the quality beans I've been spoiled with by Olive Nation in both Madagascar and Tahitian varieties.

review/summary: Premium Bourbon-Madagascar Vanilla Beans - 1/4 lb. - Approx. 27 beans
review/text: I ordered this product hoping that I would get a great product, and was not disappointed.  The vanilla beans arrived before the first day of the estimated date of delivery!!  When I finally got them un-boxed and could get my first look & feel, I was not disappointed.  Nice long, plump, and juicy.  Upon opening I got a wonderful hit of vanilla and knew I was in for a real treat.  Once I had the ones out I needed I noticed they had a nice black glossy color and nice plump feel to them.  Slicing them open was extremely easy, and revealed copious amounts of gooey black seeds.<br /><br />As of right now they have been halved lengthwise, then cut into 1/2 inch sections, put into a stoppered bottle with 80 proof brandy, and are being left in a cool to moderate temperature completely dark cupboard for the next 6 months.  I'll shake it up every 1 or 2 days for the first month, then twice a week for the next month, then once a week for the last 4 months.  Sounds involved but it only takes a few seconds each time to shake it.<br /><br />I am extremely happy to have made this purchase!  I will definitely be buying from this seller again in the near and far futures.  Great product guys, keep up the excellent work!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CR1ELU">Premium Bourbon-Madagascar Vanilla Beans - 1/4 lb. - Approx. 27 beans</a>

review/text: I ordered the vanilla beans since I was looking to make some home made ice cream.  I absolutely love the style of ice cream where you can see the vanilla caviar (black specks) in it.  I used a basic sweet cream base recipe.  That recipe is fine but it was taken to another level when I added the bean pod with the caviar scraped into the mix.  This vanilla is very tasty.  Regular vanilla extract from the store can't come close.  I'm so glad I found them on Amazon.  I'm sure I would have paid a lot more at the local gourmet grocery store.  Do not hesitate to order this vanilla.  You won't be sorry.
