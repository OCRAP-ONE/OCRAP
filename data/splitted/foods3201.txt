review/summary: Wonderful tea!
review/text: I was mostly a coffee drinker (Peet's) for decades.  When I drank tea it was loose leaf Darjeeling, but on a whim I ordered some of this tea.  I'm surprised to say that I've given up coffee altogether and only drink this tea in the mornings.  It is a great start to the day, enough (but not too much) caffeine -- I feel better, less jittery and I absolutely love the taste.  If you're looking for an everyday tea, give this a try -- it's better than any American tea I've tried.

review/summary: Good taste, but way too mushy
review/text: For the taste, I'd give 4 or 4.5 stars. Pretty good, tastes a little bit like raspberry cheesecake (thought I mostly think it's like a yogurt flavor).<br /><br />Problem with this bar is that it's way too soft. It gets crushed/flattened in my pocket, bag, or anywhere else. Even when I'm unwrapping a new bar, it falls apart in the wrapper as I'm opening it! This doesn't affect the taste much, but it does hurt the portability of this snack item.<br /><br />Also, being a 90 calorie bar, it's not the greatest for satisfying hunger.

review/text: These bars are my least favorite of the Special K bars. I usually eat a bar in the morning on the way to work and figured I would try this flavor. I think it tastest horrible. I think Special K is grasping at straws with this flavor and I don't think it will do well. The combination of raspberry and cheese flavor they put together makes you barely want to finish the bar you started.<br /><br />I recommend not trying this flavor and sticking to the flavors you like.

review/text: Its sometimes hard to find good gluten-free treats, let alone wonderful ones.  This particular cookie is one of the wonderful ones and well worth the cost.<br /><br />If you served these and didn't tell anyone, they'd never know these delicious lemon wafer cookies are gluten-free.  They are just the right balance of not being too tart or too sweet and, though I enjoy the chocolate flavor wafer cookies, the lemon ones remain my favorite.  I've taken them along to potluck events and parties and people love them.<br /><br />Eat them as is or garnish a bowl of ice cream with them and you won't be disappointed.  And in a world of disappointment over what items you can't eat if you're going gluten-free, its nice to find something yummy that you can splurge on.

review/summary: Bengal Spice for Iced Tea
review/text: Both Bengal Spice and the very similar Celestial Seasonings product, Gingerbread Spice are my faves. I make sun tea in my backyard then pour the tea over ice for a very refreshing herbal 'tea' drink that doesn't need sugar, or lemon to quench a thirst. Here in the Southwest where summers are long, hot & dry, it's important to stay hydrated & this is a great pick-me-up.<br /><br />* This is a non-caffeinated tea<br /><br />(There's one other thing I do with Bengal Spice that might surprise you. When making jam or jelly, I sometimes swirl a bag or two in the hot jam a minute or two before pouring it in the jars. It adds a delightful exotic tone to some plain-jane jam recipes.)

review/text: This is just the best "herb" tea!  It's actually a sumptuous blend of a few exotic spices, with a kiss of vanilla.  It's yummy as a delectable pastry or dessert but it can be brewed up in a few minutes, smells divine, and can be consumed without guilt (read zero calories, fat, sodium, etc.,).  If you love cinnamon, you HAVE to try it.  The hint of cardamom, ginger, plus a few other all-natural flavors, simply pushes this tea to the top spot on the delight-o-meter.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it can be a bit hard to find outside Colorado.<br /><br />I hope you keep it in stock Amazon.  Thanks.

review/summary: This tea holds a prominent place in my cupboard!
review/text: For a bagged tea, Bengal Spice is packed with fresh flavor.  When I selected a box at my co-op, I thought the flavor would be deeper and spicier.  When I brewed it, I was pleasantly surprised with the sweet notes that it had.  This is the perfect drink for the holidays.  The rich smell and sweet flavor is something I would drink while reading a book next to a fire or after an evening of sled riding with family and friends.  Additionally, I would consider Bengal Spice to a perfect dessert tea that would pair well with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M1V8ZM">Matiz Andaluz Torta de Aceite, Sugared, 6-Count (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />I love chai.  When I bought the box, I didn't notice that the manufacturer was calling this a caffeine-free interpretation of chai.  While chai was not the first thing that I thought of when I first drank this, I would find Bengal Spice to be an acceptable substitute for the real chai; Bengal Spice has all the right flavors and maybe with some coconut milk, it might be more in line with my vision of chai.<br /><br />I mostly drink loose teas because I find them to be fresher and more environmentally friendly.  As noted, this is a very fresh tea and compared to other bagged teas more green in its packaging.  The Bengal Spice tea bags not individually wrapped, which reduces waste.<br /><br />I will note that the unbrewed tea bags have an incredibly intense smell that I did not find pleasant.  Thankfully, once brewed, the scent changes and is quite nice and comforting.  Another potential negative for some will be the settling that occurs with this tea.  There is a progression of tastes with this tea.  As one might expect, as you get closer to the bottom of the mug, the spiciness increases due to settling of the various ingredients.  This may not be to everyone's liking and a good stir may be needed midway through the mug.<br /><br />All in all, a very fine tea.  I really like the flavor.  I see this as my go-to winter comfort beverage.

review/text: Not that I despise or even dislike the benefits that caffeine brings, but sometimes, we just want something that allows us to relax. This is an exclamation mark in the herbal tea market and I have introduced many a friend and family member to the complex flavors and balance that Bengal Spice offers.<br />  No matter the season, this blend carries its own weight, on ice in the summer, warm in the winter, it dares to be disliked. The simple packaging lends to the good-feeling of this treat and always makes me wonder why I ever buy the cheap stuff. Enjoy, this is truly a nectar of the gods, you won't be disappointed.

review/text: Alright, I'll admit, I wasn't expecting much when I picked this box up off the grocery store shelf for $2.34.  I used to drink my favorite loose leaf green teas at night, but when I started working earlier, even the green kept me up. I needed to lose the caffeine. I love spice, so I went with the kitty box here, Bengal Spice.<br /><br />I can't believe this is less than 12 cents a cup.  Right when you open the pouch you're overwhelmed with this amazing sweet smell of cinnamon and spice.  It only gets better.  The whole room ends up smelling like a bakery while you're steeping it, and it tastes as great as it smells.  Now I've got all my jars of fine loose leaf green teas, and one jar with the kitty box attached to it filled with Bengal Spice tea bags.  It has carved out a spot in my collection for years to come.  Forget dessert, it's in the cup.

review/summary: Good alternative to Good Earth's product
review/text: Tried this tea for the first time recently, and was pleasantly surprised. Found it to be a good alternative, and similar in taste, to the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Caffeine Free variety, which seems lately to have had both a packaging change and a price increases at least via Amazon.<br /><br />One difference between the two is that the Celestial Seasonings tea bags come bulk packages in each box, with the tea bags group in tear-apart two-bag pieces. No strings and no individual tea bag packaging. Whereas the Good Earth varieties come with both string and tag attached to each bag, and then each bag individually packaged.<br /><br />But actually, since I use these teas for making homemade pitchers of iced tea, I don't really care about the packaging or wrapping differences. And I found the taste of the Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice to be pleasing and enjoyable.<br /><br />That and, unlike the Good Earth varieties lately, I don't have to worry about getting the caffeinated tea variety by mistake with Celestial Seasonings. It's clear that their product is just herbal tea.

One of the few brews I don't add sugar to, it's naturally sweet, making it a fantastic iced tea you can drink all afternoon without worrying about caffeine overload.<br /><br />It's also a pretty good herbal chai alternative, with classic chai ingredients such as cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, black pepper and cardamom. Just add a little milk to your cup once it's done steeping and you've got a rich treat that feels indulgent, but without all the calories. Now my husband is hooked, so we buy in bulk.

review/text: I buy this amazing tea by the Amazon case and am sure to have it in the house at all times.  For a truly decadent and easy Chai, mix up a tall mug of Big Train, then add a Bengal Spice tea bag.  Wait 3 minutes as you savor the steam.  If this isn't what heaven smells like, then god isn't perfect.  Yes.  It is as delicious as its aroma.

review/text: This is a really intense tea with lots of flavor.  You can make it with just water or 1/2 milk.  A bit of honey sets it off and if you want a dessert, just add whipped cream.  No caffeine makes this a great after dinner treat. Very good price and I got free shipping!

review/summary: Bengal Spice Roars!
review/text: Bengal Spice by Celestial Seasons is my favorite herbal tea.  I drink it in the summer and inhale it in the winter.  I love the overwhelming cinnamon taste and I enjoy all the flavors.  To get the really full bodied flavor that I like, I only get one cup of tea to the tea bag; for that reason I have this on subscription so that I will not run out.  Great product.

review/text: Bengal Spice tea is rich with cinnamon and a hint of sweetness.  I drink it with or without honey- it's great either way. The aroma is fantastic!  My nine year old daughter likes it too- though she doesn't steep her bag so long, as the sharp "spice" can be a bit overwhelming for her if allowed to become strong.<br /><br />I have to add that we love the artwork on this box as well.  All the Celestial Seasoning boxes are nice, but this one is exceptionally beautiful.

review/summary: Best tasting tea - better than Chai
review/text: I've been a Celestial Seasonings fanatic for about 3 years now.<br /><br />Their sleepytime, tension tamer, chamomile, honey vanilla chamomile, and mint magic teas all were pretty pleasant.  Oh, and around the holidays the local stores get the Sugar Cookie, Candy Cane Lane, and Gingerbread blends.<br /><br />This tea closely resembles the Gingerbread blend they currently sell, however, it tastes so much better.  There is an added ingredient or taste that just simply is missing from the gingerbread tea.  Bengal Spice tea is my new favorite tea.  I love the spicy initial taste, and depending on the cream you use, the after taste following is very uplifting.  It is a very rich tea and tastes very good with a sweet treat like some peanut M&Ms, or any other milk chocolate.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings, hats off to you again for making such a great tea.<br /><br />Tea drinkers, you have to try this.  I'm a bengal spice-o-holic.

review/summary: Best tea I've found...
review/text: I can't get enough of this tea.  I use a boiling water kettle that I purchased here on Amazon to boil 32 ounces of water.  4 bags of this tea, with 3 packets of stevia goes into each pot.  I make two pots at a time, fill them half full with boiling water and let them steep for a couple of hours.  Then each pot fills one half of a liter 'bormoglio' canning bottle, fill the rest with filtered water and in to the refrigerator they go.  It keeps me out of serious trouble with diet colas :)  It's wonderful iced or hot, but this time of the year the refreshing cold tea right from the fridge is perfect and tastes sooooooo good.  No caffeine so great for those of us that are sensitive to caffeine too late in the day.  I finally have something good to offer friends that drop by and they have all commented on how good and refreshing it was.  No aftertaste left when using Stevia as opposed to artificial sweeteners or sugar.

review/summary: A good spiced tea, but...
review/text: I used to love this tea, until I bought my most recent box. I had used a few bags of tea and they were good - you could taste the other spices in the tea. However, when I brewed some tea at work this morning all I could taste was cinnamon. It was horrible! Perhaps some of the bags were from a bad batch? The cinnamon oil flavour was just overwhelming and I poured the tea down the drain. I'm now reluctant to use any more bags from this box. Not impressed with the lack of consistency in the quality of this product.

review/text: I like sweet foods and I add at least 2 tablespoons sugar to regular leaf tea, but this is so sweet I don't need to add sugar. I also don't add milk because I prefer the strong herbal taste and milk makes it more bland but creamy. For me personally it helps prevent and reduce headaches and stave off appetite. Highly recommended for people who want to reduce sugar in their diet.

review/summary: As a person who HATES Tea
review/text: I LOVE Bengal Spice.  I think my problem with most teas is that I always have to add a sweetener or cream or something to it to make it tolerable.  This is perfect the way it is.  There's a definite cinnamon taste, but there's a subtle sweetness as well.  Kind of like a cider.<br /><br />This was suggested to me since I love Chai lattes so much (focus on the latte, not the tea). And it serves as a great, cheap, calorie free substitute.<br /><br />My only issues are:<br /><br />1. It seems to have stopped up my regularity, if you get my drift.  I've basically had to supplement my diet with more pure fiber.<br /><br />2. I can NEVER find it in stores.  They either don't carry Celestial Seasonings (odd), don't carry this flavor(odder), or are completely out of stock (not odd at all...but frustrating!). Thank God I can load up in bulk via Amazon. Note to Celestial Seasonings, please feel free to use this review to push more sales in grocery stores.  As it is, I've changed my shopping locales to (the few) stores that carry it.  So there!

I found it on Amazon and I was delighted.  The tea was not in that wonderful box with the tiger sprawling, not that a box makes a difference.  The boxes and bags were smaller.  I used to be able to make two rip roaring cups and if I left my cup overnight, I would be greeted by that aroma next morning.  Not so much this.  I couldn't get much flavor from even the first bag and I have six boxes.  I am on a mission to find one of the old boxes to see whether my palate has changed or whether I just got a weak batch.  I want my old Bengal Spice.

review/text: Celstial Seasonings makes a wide variety of excellent teas, of which Bengal Spice is my favorite.  Naturally caffeine free - it contains no tea leaves but rather is totally herbal - I like it with milk and a bit of sugar.  It is very aromatic and very much like a true India "Chai" tea.  We serve it often to friends who all love it too.  Ingredients are cinnamon,roasted chicory and carob, natural spice and vanilla flavor, ginger, cardamom, black pepper, cloves and nutmeg.  Wow!!  It is especially convenient to purchase from Amazon, as I typically find it hard to find in local - even large - supermarkets.

review/text: I bought this after reading the fine reviews for it.  I was looking for Morning Thunder because it had caffeine and yerba mate.  Six boxes Thunder and six Bengal... by and far Bengal has been my favorite.  It's interesting how the black pepper mixes in with the other flavors... definitely a huge wow factor.  I've never really been into tea, but this has been so sweet to start each day at work.  No caffeine too!

review/text: I have been drinking Bengal Spice for thirty years.  It is hard to find Bengal Spice in the grocery stores, so I was thrilled to see it here on Amazon.  Bengal Spice has concentrated spices in it, which give it a warm, sweet flavor and is highly aromatic.  I have put a bag to "brew" in warm applesauce which gives the applesauce a great flavor.

review/summary: The only Celestial Seasonings tea that I like
review/text: I bought this tea last year and was surprised at how much flavor it has -- it literally burns your throat with all the cinnamon if you keep the teabag in, and has a sweet flavor without adding any sweetener. I equate it with the candy Fireballs. I forgot about it until now when I just got a cold and none of my other teas were doing it for me. Great stuff.

review/summary: Surprisingly good, but could be a bit better
review/text: I'm not usually a Celestial Seasonings fan.  I find many of their offerings decidedly below par.  But Bengal Spice is actually pretty good.  It's perfect for cinnamon fans, as that is undoubtedly the boldest taste in this blend.  And it's true that you don't need to sweeten it; the cinnamon takes care of that itself.<br /><br />In terms of strength it's nice and bold.  The vanilla smoothes everything out though...it's not too strong, unless you let the bag steep for an inordinately long time.  But Bengal Spice does have one notable weakness....for those looking for a great chai, you might be disappointed.  Because while it's strong and has a nice flavor, the ginger, cardamom, nutmeg etc. is hardly noticeable, masked by the strength of the cinnamon.  It's a shame, because this blend is definitely better-tasting than some, such as Yogi's classic India Spice.  If the other "chai spices" in this blend had been stronger, this would be a 5-star tea.

review/summary: Better than Chai
review/text: The negative reviews for Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice Tea are from people who were expecting chai. This company does imply this is their VERSION of chai, but NOT that it is suppose to BE chai... it is not a decaf version of chai... if it was, it would say that and I'm sure the taste would be different. This is a SPICE tea, that is decaf. That's all. Upon giving up caffeine, I turned to this to REPLACE my chai tea, and it did NOT disappoint! It is excellent, but like other reviews good or bad, that is MY opinion. My kids love it, and prefer it over hot cocoa when we add a touch of almond milk. Needs no sweetening in my opinion and I wouldn't change a thing! Again, it IS NOT CHAI! But it's a GREAT way to replace chai and the caffeine in it, if you're concerned about that.<br /><br />Although cinnamon is the predominant flavor, I have to BEG to differ on the thought that it taste like Big Red or Red Hot candy boiled in water... NOT SO. The taste is lovely when combined with the other flavors. I suppose you would need to taste it to form your OWN opinion. To us, it's FANTASTIC. Would recommend and would order again and again.

review/summary: Change in Recipe, But Still Pretty Good
review/text: I had one of the "tiger" boxes of Bengal Spice tea for quite some time, but never tasted it.  When I finally tasted it, I was delighted.  It was superb. (Bengal Spice is, by the way, a combination of spices and of roasted chickory.)<br /><br />I don't care much for green tea.  But Bengal Spice was so good that I was able to steep it with bags of green tea, producing an excellent combination.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to order a six-pack of Bengal Spice. But one of the recent reviews that I had read was correct.  The formulation is dramatically different.<br /><br />The tea that I just received is pretty good.  I only found it to be "good" by adding a bit of apple juice.  Unfortunately, it's no longer superb.<br /><br />On well, I guess I'll buy more anyway. I just don't care that much for the taste of green trea.

review/summary: KHAPHA DOSHA
review/text: I didn't like this at first. It was too hot (I like spice, including food, aromas and perfume. Hot and spicy aren't necessarily the same thing).  It did not taste sweet to me unless I used two tea bags.  Unfortunately this seemed too sweet for me this way and the smell was somewhat annoying.  Meanwhile, I ordered Jasmine tea around the same time which is an EXTREMELY bitter green tea if you steep it too long or with too hot water(found this out the hard way).  Then it hit me. Since I didn't like either of them, why not brew the two together and see what happens.  PERFECT EUREKA!!  They seem to balance and compliment each other.  The combination brew is neither too bitter nor too spicy.  It's delicious together and I feel good after drinking it.  The spices used in the Bengal Spice are all given as balancing to the Khapha dosha, as is Jasmine tea (did not know this when I ordered the teas).  I think I stumbled across something good here. I sweeten the brew with a touch of raw honey.

review/summary: 3.5 million pounds, really?
review/text: This is a very tasty tea - nice and spicy, plenty of cinnamon and the ginger gives a nice bite, and no caffeine.  Every box I've gotten has been fresh.  My gripe however is the lack of strings.  The box claims they save 3.5 million pounds(!?) of landfill waste every year by not using individual wrappers or strings/tags/staples.  That seems like an exaggerated claim, and the lack of strings and staples is a real annoyance in my book.  It means I always should use/carry a spoon in order to agitate the bags a bit while steeping, and remove them from the hot tea.  It's so annoying I even considered only 3 stars.  Mostly I drink tea at the office, and bringing a spoon around with me to meetings is odd, so instead I tend to wait until tea is cooler and use my fingers, which also is odd.  Individual wrappers I can do without because I drink frequently enough the tea doesn't go stale, but please give me strings and staples.

review/text: If you are looking for something comparable to the Chai at you-know-where, skip this tea.  I bought some after reading the reviews, but felt they really missed the mark.  This tea should be simply called "Cinnamon Tea"--that is the ONLY flavor I taste, and not at all like Chai.  Imagine melted Red Hots dissolved in water, and that is about what this tea tastes like.  I love Celestial Seasonings tea usually, but this one is really overpowering with the cinnamon flavor, which should be better pointed out on the box.  I am going to try their India Spice tea based on other reviews, and will hopefully find something more complex like what I am looking for (and will hopefully be a nice substitute for the expensive Chai from Starbuck's).

Now that I am back and have finished brewing a cup of this tea, I find that there has never been such an on point review! A cup of red hots brewed in hot water is EXACTLY what this tea tastes like- I could have boiled some cinnamon sticks from the cupboard and got the same taste. Where are all of the other flavors? Um, not here in this tea, I tell you that much! I am NOT sure if this has anything to do with this being the decafe version, but I will NOT be buying this again. I got through the cup by adding some agave and rice milk, but  I  feell like I just finished a pack of wrigley's red hot gum...what a hot mess!

I have tried different strawberry flavorings, ones that are made with better ingredients and/or are organic, since that is my preference, but my kids hate them.  I wish this wasn't made with HFCS, but it is the only thing in my home that has high-fructose corn syrup in it, so I kid myself that it's okay.  The fact that is comes in a three-pack is very handy.  I may just run out of it one day and "not be able to buy it anymore."  But, for now, to keep the morning peace in my house, I will carry on with Hershey's strawberry syrup.

review/summary: Picky Papillons Love It
review/text: My Papillons (ages 8 and 9) have been the pickiest damn dogs I have ever met.  You know when the vet says "they will eat eventually, they won't starve"?  Well, no.  These damn dogs would starve if they didn't get to eat something they liked.  I have been struggling for years to find food that is not made in China, not made from chicken from China even if manufactured in the USA.  Finally, I found Halo.  I integrated the Halo Spots Stew kibble and the Halo Spot's Stew chicken canned into the Paps diet over 2 weeks.  Week one they ate half of the Halo and by the end of week two they were eating ALL of the Halo product and the small amount of the old brand was left in their bowls.  Their skin is fantastic, their poops are a perfect consistency (not too hard or too soft) and they are energetic and just happy and excited for meal time now.  I also feed them the Halo LiL Bits freeze dried chicken treats.  All of the ingredients are from USA and made solely here.  And, I am thrilled that my favorite TV talk show host, Ms. Ellen Degeneres is a part owner of the company.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for offering this here as it is hard to get in my somewhat small town pet stores who seem to cater to gross China food that will make all our dogs sick.

review/text: I have spent 2 years trying to find some sort of dog food that won't break the bank, that's made with dog health in mind, and that my dogs actually like. having said that, I was truly skeptical about buying this, simply because of the price. I mean, it's dog food, they all look the same. But. it's. awesome. I started off by mixing in a spoon full of it into their regular food, and for the first time ever my dogs were cleaning their plates. its got chunks of real vegetables in it, and in combination with the dried food (also Halo, I mix the salmon with the lamb) my dogs are eating like kings and queens: 3 types of meat, 15 types of veggies & fruits...wow.<br /><br />I'm totally in love with this brand. I have switched over EVERYTHING, their treats, their dry food and their wet food.if halo comes out with a flavored water supplement for dogs, I'll probably buy that too. its just a great brand, reliable, and with a conscience.

review/text: After reading horrible reviews about dog food and with the onset of my puppy having seizures, I made him only home cooked meals specifically for dogs.  He was having stomach problems and went through many different recipes always consulting with my Vet, but then I found Halo dog food.  My dog eats this and looks for more, his stomach problems have subsided and he's doing very well. This was such a relief due to his seizures and stomach problems and I tried so hard to make him well.  He's been on Halo canned chicken Spots Stew now for 2 months and I am so relieved.  Now if only I could do something about the seizures, all would be well.  However, I give very high recommendations for Halo food.  A bit expensive, but worth every penny.  I need to add that I know how much Ellen Degeneres loves dogs and put my trust in her advocating Halo food.  I'm not sorry. Thanks Ellen.  Thanks Amazon for carrying it and offering monthly subscriptions.

They responded right away to tell me that the product was coming from the UK and that it doesn't usually take anywhere near that long.  It arrived the next day.  I am very pleased with the service and the product. I HIGHLY recommend both and will be ordering again in the near future.

review/summary: Wonderful Cup of Tea!
review/text: After trying a lot of different Decaf teas, PG Tips is absolutely wonderful.  Over the years, I have been brewing different caffinated English brand teas because of the bold flavor.  When it became necessary to start using decaf instead, the one of the only teas I was able to find that still proved that strong, bold, smooth and yet not bitter taste has been PG Decaf. I would highly recomment it to anyone who drinks tea.  You can not tell that it is decaf.

review/text: I drink only pg tips tea. It is hard to find decaf locally and pg tips is the only kind of decaf I like and I need to cut back on the caffeine for health reasons. The product arrived in a timely manner, only thing is it is expensive, over $9.00 for a box of 80 bags,therefore I shall continue to try to find a more reasonable source.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I like plenty of tea at night, but want to be able to sleep so first I tried Tetley's decaf and it was OK. This, however is the best. It's darn close to the regular PG Tips which I drink early in the day. Worth any extra price.
