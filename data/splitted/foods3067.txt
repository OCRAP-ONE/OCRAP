review/summary: Sorta like Sunshine Golden Fruit...
review/text: I have been looking for a Sunshine (Keebler) Golden Fruit Raisin Biscuit alternative, and these were listed on a Facebook page dealing with Golden Fruit.<br /><br />They are Golden Fruitish; definitely not what I was hoping for.  However, they are good in their own special way, and their consistency makes them perfect for a coffee/tea accompaniment.  They are crispier, dryer, and have a hint of graham cracker flavor...with raisins!  I found myself eating one after the other...but then I am a Golden Fruit lover.  I have no idea what the calorie count is of what I am consuming as there is no info on the label.<br /><br />At this price, these biscuits are a bargain.  The ingredients are somewhat healthful and they aren't laden with a bunch of unpronounceable chemicals.  Using subscribe and save makes them even more of a deal!  I say TRY THEM!  I am sticking with my subscription, and looking forward to my next delivery.

review/summary: Nutty Marshmallow rocks
review/text: I just tried the nutty marshmallow and it is awesome.<br />I have problems with some bars due to acid reflux and also gallbladder problems, but this hasn't bothered me yet. Plus at 150 calories it is a pretty lightweight snack, though a little small. Vegan too for those who want vegan treats. It's not made from real marshmallow root (which I was hoping for), but then almost no marshmallow snacks are.

review/text: This tastes so delicious. It's about the size and texture of a Larabar--maybe a little bit bigger. Especially if you enjoy other PROBAR bars, you will like this taste and blend of goodies. There are big chocolate chunks in it and marshmallow patches, too. I just wish the ingredients were all organic and that the marshmallows did not contain "soy protein" (AKA hexane-rinsed soy protein concentrate/isolate). However, it is really, really good.

review/summary: can't taste the "smore's"
review/text: I eat a lot of nutrition bars and I like this style of chewy whole food bar, but I think the packaging and name of this bar is very misleading. It tastes exactly like every other ProBar and I cannot taste any of the "Smore" elements. It also is smaller than the Fruition bars which have the same number of calories. I was very disappointed because I thought this would have more of a dessert-y flavor.

review/summary: I like that it is vegan, but hate that it has a boring flavor
review/text: I tried the Rocky Road flavor and while it is not awful, it is nothing to rave over.  When something is described as a "sinfully healthy snack", I expect it to taste magical and leave me in awe that it only has 140 calories.  These small bars are not decadent or sinfully healthy.  They taste like unsweetened no-bake cookies to an extent and have a slight vitamin aftertaste that frequently accompanies protein and nutrition bars.  Inside the bar, I found a couple of nuts but everything else melded together and if it were a blind taste test, I would never guess them to be rocky road inspired.  Nutritionally, I don't think this bar is great.  For a small 140 calorie bar, it has a good deal of fat (8g) and sugar (9g).<br /><br />If you insist on trying these and they are out of stock here, you can get your halo bar fix on iherb.com.  You can use code LEK375 for a discount.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.

review/text: I have tried many healthy bars and this is probably the one that I would never get sick of it.  All the infredients used does not leave any over-powering taste. I also like Lara bar which I also eat everyday, but I some time got sick of Lara bar specific flavor .  Lara bar though is healthier due to the raw ingredients with no sugar or other processed food.  Based on the taste and the ingredient, I some time treat the rocky road bar as healthy desert. Try eating it with vanilla or chocolate ice cream..... Yummy!

review/summary: honey graham is excellent
review/text: This review is for the honey graham flavor. I have not yet tried the other flavors. These small bars are very tasty and not overly sweet (even though rice syrup is the first ingredient). The nutrition profile is as good or better than most bars although a single bar does have 8% RDA of sodium which means this is not a low sodium snack. These bars are small, compared for instance to kashi go lean bars and cliff bars, but very satisfying. I find these bars are great for overcoming a craving between meals when fruit or veg is not available or won't satisfy. I would not rely on these bars for performance events or in a post-apocalypse survival kit, but the Halo honey graham bars are a nice alternative, especially if you're burnt-out on other bars.

review/text: I'm a such sucker for sweets. So when I saw these "candy bar alternatives" at REI during their labor day weekend sale, I just couldn't resist! I snatched up a few flavors (honey graham, smores, and rocky road) along with some other bars to try out. I couldn't believe how delicious and low in sugar these bars were. The fact that almost all their ingredients are organic and recognizable ingredients (no crazy chemical names) was a major plus. It's also vegan and dairy-free, but does have peanuts and wheat.<br /><br />These are definitely a great little afternoon snack that's between 150-160 calories each. Now, I'm on Amazon searching for a cheaper way to get more of them!

review/summary: Chocolate Coconut Zing Bars are Fantastic!
review/text: I bought my first Chocolate Coconut Zing Bar at a Whole Foods Store while on vacation in New York City.  I absolutely loved it!  It tasted great, and best of all, it is Gluten Free and has the exact amount of protein to balance out the carbs that it contains.  This is very important to me, because I am gluten intolerant, and because I am following a carb-counting food plan to lose weight and to prevent myself from developing type-two diabetes.  These bars make a great quick breakfast if you are in a hurry; they are also good whenever you need a quick pick-me-up during a hectic day or while traveling.  When I came home from NYC, I tried to find Zing bars in my local Whole Foods Store, but it doesn't carry them!  Thank goodness for Amazon.com!

review/text: We've been buying hooves at Costco (when they had them) and Petsmart.<br /><br />The problem with the Petsmart ones we bought the last two times is that when the dogs were chewing on them, the hooves admitted a horrible stench.  We thought that the dogs were passing gas.<br /><br />No such problem with these.  In fact, the only problem with these hooves are the same with any hooves we've bought.  Give one to each of four dogs and one dog ends up with four, chewing on one and guarding the rest. LOL<br /><br />I believe I paid a whole lot less for this box of 30 than I paid for a few at Petsmart.

review/summary: We Choose Choo Hooves
review/text: We have tried several types of chewing treats for our four dogs.  Our dogs lose interest in the Nyla products, rawhide treats make them puke, and cow hooves available in bulk are brittle and reappear from one end or the other in sharp pieces.  The first time we bought Pet Carousel Choo Hooves from Petco we noticed a big difference. Our dogs keep working at them until they're almost gone. Instead of being brittle and reappearing later, they seem to break apart efficiently with no digestive problems.  They also help keep our dogs' teeth clean, although they are a bit stinky.<br /><br />All hooves seem to smell, but these have proven to be the best all around chew treat out there.  Be careful when shopping for these.  Make sure that they are "Pet Carousel Choo Hooves".  Many other brands have similar names but are very different products.

review/summary: Great Green Tea Experience, Tazo's Best
review/text: *****<br />Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent "natural flavors" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!<br /><br />The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these "natural flavors" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor." This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as "grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey". Tazo describes the aroma as "vegetative, popcorn".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.<br />*****

review/text: Beautiful, perfectly tight little capers arrive in clear glass jars when you purchase the Roland Organic Nonpareil Capers.  For all their beauty tho, these are some of the saltiest capers I've ever had, and that's of course allowing for the fact that capers are indeed supposed to be briney.  Will try other varieties next  time, perhaps the Roland organic capers in sherry vinegar.  In the meantime, these are quite serviceable when rinsed thoroughly before use, but the subtle flower flavor noticeable in other caper brands is just a bit obscured by the salt, salt, and salt.

review/text: when comparing the cheap Ceylons on amazon, this tea is weaker and blander than the more malty full flavored <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112GBO0">Dilmah Tea, 100% Pure Ceylon Tea, Loose Leaf, 4.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> but this loose leaf is more visually appealing and less caulky than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZMY">Ahmad 500g Loose Ceylon Tea, 1.23-Ounce Packet (Pack of 4)</a>.  my advice is if you use a paper filter, get the Dilmah since it can be occasionally dusty, but if you use a pinhole or strainer steeper, then this Coffee Bean Direct Ceylon may serve you better if you use 50% more leaf than usual.  for example I only need 1g of Dilmah leaf bits per 8oz cup, but to match the color and flavor with Coffee Bean Direct, I need to use 1.5g of this regular leaf.

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: High quality Ceylon Tea. Superior to anything else I have tried. It's very good as iced tea too. I add little honey and lemon juice. Plain, the best temperature is around 40-45f, when you can actually taste the flavor while it is still refreshingly cold. Once you try this, you will never buy bagged teas. If you need baggies, they can be purchased separately.

review/summary: Excellent tea, great price
review/text: My wife is an avid tea junkie. She literally can not live without it for a day. The "bag" type they sell in supermarkets is completely useless for all intents and purposes, and brands like Lipton make her laugh. I can relate, I myself used to drink leaf tea back when we lived in Europe years ago, but have successfully kicked the habit since :), Well, we were forced to look for good loose tea, preferably Ceylon, after she moved here, and found Coffee Bean Direct. We've been purchasing from their website on and off since 2008, and the tea has been of consistently good quality and utterly enjoyable. The downside to it was the inconvenience of ordering from rather far away, the wait and the shipping charges. To my excitement, I recently stumbled upon the same product on Amazon, and immediately ordered, somewhat worried, as it's been a while since our last direct order. Well, the fast and free shipping, excellent packaging and superb product were our biggest reward. This tea in our opinion, supersedes the (still pretty good) Dilmah and Ahmad we've been able to find locally in the past year. You just need to see its leaves to believe it, and at this price, you just can't go wrong. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Very good tea. Excellent value for money
review/text: The product is a huge bag of whole-leaf Ceylon tea. Ceylon is subtler than, say, Lipton's Brisk, and may seem weak until you get used to it. This is a big leaf tea. For a first class cuppa and you'll need at least a heaping teaspoon per cup.  And steep it for five minutes. Not to worry, it won't over-extract and turn bitter. CBD's teas are middle-grade generics. If you're a tea snob who requires single-estate leaves, look elsewhere. If you want good varietal tea for not a lot of money, CBD is pretty hard to beat. I have enjoyed their Wulong and Orange Pekoe too. I was glad to find their tea here on Amazon where it's cheaper than on CBD's own website and qualifies for free shipping too.

review/summary: Good stuff, good price
review/text: I am a tea-o-holic. I don't drink coffee and I prefer black teas. I have gotten Ceylon teas from a number of sources. The Coffee Bean Direct Ceylon is not the best I ever tasted but it is close. It brews up a rich brown-red and has enough "kick" to get me going a bit. It can be over-brewed and get a little bitter. As soon as a nice rich color forms during steeping, pour it off through a tea strainer.<br />2 pounds is a lot of tea, so I put it in well sealed glass jars in a cool dark place after opening.<br />For the price and quality, I will buy this Ceylon tea again. I have a number of the Coffee Bean Direct teas. I hope they continue to offer good teas in bulk and hope that Amazon continues to carry it!

review/summary: Extremely delicious-- the best sweet barbecue sauce I've ever had
review/text: I am not a bona fide cook, nor am I a barbecue expert. Most of my sampling of authentic down-south barbecues has happened on business trips, and I've sampled most of the types of barbecue sauces available at the local grocery stores. I happened to luck on this one at the grocery store the other day when shopping for something that wouldn't be too spicy for the chillun. We brought it home that night and used it to dunk pieces of chicken, and I was blown away.<br /><br />I am at a bit of a loss as to how to describe the flavor. It is sweet and tangy, and slightly spicy but just enough to be pleasant-- I don't think people with even sensitive palates would dislike this sauce. In a way, though of course they have some different ingredients, this is like a much more refined, more delicious version of the Sweet Chili chicken nugget sauce from McDonald's, which we also like. (No, this is not the creme de la creme of food connoisseur reviews, but you knew that going in.)<br /><br />The ingredient list on my bottle includes these items in order: water, vinegar, sugar, tomato paste, molasses, and honey, with less than 2% of salt, aged cayenne pepper, natural smoke flavor, modified food starch, dextrose, spice, corn syrup, caramel color, garlic, xanthan gum, onion, sodium benzoate as a preservative, maltodextrin, tamarind, autolyzed yeast extract, and natural flavor. Ingredients may of course change over time, so make sure to read the ingredients on whatever you buy.<br /><br />I've only used it for dipping, not actual barbecue. As a grilling sauce I'd say it's ever so slightly on the thinner side of normal, possibly due to vinegar content, but would still work for grilling, especially with extra basting.<br /><br />ETA: During the writing of this review, I had to go heat up some chicken so I could have some of this sauce.  Mmmmmm.

Thank goodness I'm able to access Amazon and find those items again without wasting many hours and much gas traveling to every store withing 50 miles to locate an item every grocer used to carry.  The price I was paying isn't much different from the Amazon cost thanks to super saver shipping.  This is a smooth coffee with a perfect hint of vanilla.....just right.  Glad I could find it again.

review/summary: In a word..........YUK!!!
review/text: I'm only giving these 'truffles' a one star rating because there is no ZERO star rating...  I am a lover of chocolates of all kinds, I am always looking for a tastier candy experience, which is why I tried these.  If you judge by the majority of reviews, you'd think these are pretty darned good - but I ate one.  Only one.  I threw the entire pack in the trash - all 2+ pounds of it.  I have never done that before, but these were just gross. They were all melted together into a brick, and the taste, once I got one free, was just, well... disgusting.  I read the ingredients, and then I knew why I hated them - the number ONE ingredient in these 'chocolates' is vegetable oil.  And Palm oil, at that.  I HATE palm oil!  It tastes greasy and unpleasant, even when it is NOT the primary ingredient in a snack.  PLEASE save your money and buy Ferrer-Roche (sp) or Godiva, or even Linden - all of those are yummy, if overpriced, tasty treats.  I wouldn't even give these to people I didn't like, let alone my own family.  Save your money, just because they are 'French', it doesn't make them good - take it from me, I say 'C'est tres YUK!"  Yuk-a-doodle-do!

It is rich but not overly sweet, which makes one or two pieces perfect after a meal or with a cup of espresso. Yes, during the holidays Costco sells them for half the price for a 2-box pack.  However, if you want these luscious morsels throughout the year, Amazon is a good place to get them.

review/text: These truffles are delicious and a great value; even more with free shipping [with additional purchase]! Not being individually wrapped saves waste; and one...or two...etc., certainly isn't enough! I didn't realize that the chocolate was covered with cocoa powder [and would've preferred without-which should be in big print]; but, as they say,'that is neither here nor there'[and, admittedly, once I saw 'truffles' I was totally distracted and filled with anticipation. They arrived within the timespan given, in fine shape and as delicious as anticipated. Vive La France!  In my previous review re: Kirkland Chocolates where I pointed out the ridiculous rise in price [despite the extraordinary deliciousness of the product]; I noticed that the price has been reduced somewhat. But it is still high...going from $19.99 to $49.99 within a few months! I will keep an eye on this item; it being another exceptionally delicious treat, with variety and wonderful tastes, within.

review/text: At first I wasn't sure about ordering these, but decided to give it a try.  The weather here is getting warmer and I did not want a chocolate blob arriving, thankfully these are on prime and I was able to get them in 2 days. These arrived nicely packaged, there are 2 bags inside the box shown here. I was happy to see this is a nice amount of truffles for the price and they are pretty good.  Its hard to just eat one, or two, so thankfully there are 2 bags because in my house one bag already "walked off".  I have these ready when company comes to visit and for those occasions when I am craving chocolate.  The taste is of dark chocolate, and the consistency is like someone else said, a little oily when the truffle is all done.  Overall I do like these and so do my family members! I would recommend these to anyone who enjoys a piece of dark chocolate every now and then.

They were incredibly good. I found these truffles and decided to try them. What luck! They had the same, supple flavor that I was looking for. The cocoa powder on the outside starts the taste out a bit bitter, but as you bite into them, the sweetness takes over. OMG. Just don't look at the side panel of nutritional info. Five of these little truffles will dominate your daily intake of saturated fat. Yes, only five.

review/summary: Ahhhhhh Mmmmmmm Truffles!!!!*****
review/text: This was a great delight to have such a large quantity of truffles.  They came in perfect condition.  They are covered in cocoa.  They melt in your mouth!  They are very strong chocolate flavored and sooooo good!  Defnitely recommended for chocolate lovers everywhere!  :)  They arrive in two boxes as shown within one packing box.  This keeps one box fresh while you have the other opened.  They will melt in your mouth!  The cocoa coating is not overwhelming either.  Very good taste!<br /><br />Thanks

review/summary: Duh-Licious!
review/text: I had these a while ago, and they had me at first bite! not too bitter, nor too sweet, and if you jst set it in your mouth it melts into a thick, creamy colloid. i thought of taking it further and use it as a sauce. for those of you who ever had nutella know what i'm talking about. i set a piece of bread and one truffle in the middle of said bread into a toaster oven. afterwards, i spread the  now warm and gooey chocolate on half of the bread and fold it over. very good! try it, and this is definitely the best chocolate I have ever tasted!

review/text: I sent these as a holiday gift to someone, and they RAVED about them. The price was right, and I got the reaction I wanted. I also got to sample some myself when I came across them at a local warehouse store, and they are in fact super delicious. Messy, melty, extremely chocolatey and rich, but super delicious! I liked this product because it gives a lot of bang for the buck, which is always a plus when giving a present. As for the candy, they are smooth and creamy, but extremely chocolatey, so make sure whoever you buy them for is a true chocoholic!

review/text: We got a box of CEMOR DARK TRUFFES 1 lb 12.2oz not the 2.2Pound of French Truffles we ordered. they were good but did not have the same smooth melt in your mouth quality of the Truffles we ordered.  They were a Birth Day gift for my 13 year old daughter who knew I had ordered Truffles for her, so when she saw the box delivered and opened it she did not know that they were the wrong type, and started eating and sharing with her friends.

review/summary: No problem eating these
review/text: I've been buying these for myself and others for over a year.  Price seems to be have become elastic from my previous orders (from about $8 to as much as $45, that I've seen).  At $8, the price is good.  At $45, I'd have serious reservations.<br /><br />These are Not like "See's" or other high-end flavored truffles.  These are basic (ganache-style?) smooth deep chocolate truffles, no frills.  Not as sweet as others.  Have plenty of chocolate punch; but, are not what I originally expected.  Very nice at the end of a meal; a good chocolate 'hit' without breaking the bank (at least at previous pricing).  It is a different chocolate experience which I now anticipate with a smile.  I suspect that some will be disappointed at first; but, I will definitely continue to enjoy them (as well as other styles).  If this is the French-style of chocolate truffle, I like it!<br /><br />The posted prices I've seen on Amazon have confused me.  If these are still at $8 or so, good to get.  If at $45 (which has also come up), I wouldn't buy.  Don't forget S&H.

review/text: These are just like Trader Joe's seasonal truffles they put out at the holidays; the box is similiar but of course lacks the Trader Joe's logo; the maker must be the same, however, as the taste is distinctive.<br /><br />The truffles are sweet but not too sweet--silky smooth solid chocolate truffles with a light dusting of cocoa powder--i put them in mini muffin papers and they look very festive.<br /><br />I often get headaches from chocolate but not from these; i bought 4 boxes to give as gifts.  Note, there are two pouches in the 2.2 lb box so you could get 2 gifts from one box.  They are very rich so a few go a long way.<br /><br />Wouldn't be the holidays without these truffles.

There was a bountiful number of dark chocolate 'kisses' coated with cocoa, and though I ordered them in October, I still have plenty left, and that's after sharing a pretty good sized baggie with a friend.<br /><br />However, I only give it 3 stars because it's not by any means the best chocolate.  I would have been very disappointed if I had paid full price for them.  However, at the bargain price I paid, they are just fine, and very nice to let melt in the mouth while sipping good coffee.

review/text: I ordered multiple packages for holiday client gifts and placed my order early because the estimated shipping time was 7 to 10 days if I recall correctly.  Part of my order was shipped directly to the recipients and I grouped a dozen or so in one shipment to myself to be given personally.  The whole order was shipped the next day, which was way too soon...  When I received the one big box, I was very disappointed to see that due to insufficient padding inside the box the contents had shifted and every single individual package was damaged.  Thank goodness, once you opened the package, and I made sure there was one for me too, you could slip into chocolate heaven.  These are good!!!!!

review/summary: There is no accounting for taste!
review/text: I don't mean to be disrespectful to the other reviewers - and we are all wired a bit differently, I know, especially the taste buds - but these truffles are substandard and quite nearly inedible.<br /><br />You people are simply not chocolate connoisseurs or, simply put, you have never had "proper" truffles. How could ANYONE imagine that these are the best chocolates they have ever eaten? It staggers the mind.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor and try some real, well-made truffles - you will be surprised. These are NOT it - even though these are made in France - that was the reason I bought them! The person for whom I purchased these candies said "these things are a triumph of quantity over quality." How true, how true.<br /><br />How can one champion a truffle that lists as its very first ingredient PALM OIL - followed by SUGAR and Reduced Fat Cocoa Powder and then WHEY? Palm Oil, Sugar and Whey do not, in this case, contribute to a quality product. These things taste as if a third-grader whipped them up - they are leaden, oily, and, yes, A TRIUMPH OF QUANTITY OVER QUALITY. Triste!

review/summary: Same brand ONE QUARTER the price
review/text: I can understand paying for the convenience of not having to leave my sofa when I want delicious truffles. But you can buy exactly this brand at Trader Joe's for $5. One quarter of the price! That's a bit much. You can also get one's that are very similar, but not the same exact brand, at Whole Food's for.... $6.50.<br /><br />All of that said. I love these truffles, not so much for eating straight, but for cooking with. Add them to brownies or your chocolate cake recipe for a killer death by chocolate experience. If it's brownies you're making, add some good quality macadamia nuts, halved, and there's nothing better.<br /><br />However, I will be getting these at Trader Joe's. I can drive 20 minutes and stock up.<br /><br />Warning: store these in a COOL PLACE. A box once got put on top of the fridge and there was a solid block of truffle in the morning.

review/text: They charged me $10.00 for shipping and handling.  I figured, okay, it is in a temperature secure package and they rush it because it is perishable, but no, it came in a regular box, and it was sent out before a holiday weekend, so it spent extra time floating around.  Once it arrived it was not 'individualy wrapped', but two large bags in one box.  The main ingredient if vegetable shortening and the flavor and texture is about the same as frosting off the baking shelves at my grocery store.  Waste of time and money, but if you aren't picky the flavor is okay.
