review/text: This is my least favorite flavor, I find it bland.  But these small bags are great for kids lunches, and a nice alternative to fattening chips.  The chips have a great texture for not being fried.

review/summary: If you like black pepper and you like potato chips...
review/text: Pretty much can't go wrong with these. Very peppery. Good potato flavor. Cruchy, but not mouth-injuringly so (you know how some brands of chips can be). Plus if you are extremely fastidious, you will undoubtedly enjoy the uniformity of size and shape that these chips have.<br /><br />Like Pr*ngl*s they are made from potato starch rather than actual sliced potatoes, but unlike those and other similar brands, they do not leave me feeling like I ate spoonfuls of vegetable shortening after consuming half a bag.<br /><br />The only other flavor of Popchips that I like are the plain original flavor. The other ones have poorly constructed flavor profiles in my considered opinion. Sometimes if you want to go lowfat, you really need to go simple with the seasoning, and it doesn't get much simpler than salt and pepper.

review/summary: I see why they're called POPchips!
review/text: First and foremost, shame on me. I thought these were going to taste like dry, boring, bland chip replacements. Imagine my surprise halfway through the first bite. It has the tang of a regular chip with BBQ flavor, but has the light and non-salty taste of a healthy snack. I literally had to hide the bag to prevent eating them all in one sitting. With a nice glass of sparkling water, they are a true treat and a great alternative to the usual processed chips we've all come to know, love, and mindlessly consume. I truly suggest you open your mind and buy a bag. These were absolutely wonderful to have as a late night snack, a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, and something to share with the children in my life. After one bag, you might not want to share.

review/summary: Delicious low fat treat.
review/text: Popchips are the best find I have found in a long time.  You want to eat healthy, and at the same time sometimes, you want something yummy.  Regular chips are high in fat, low fat chips give you stomach problems, baked chips taste not good to me, Popchips a little bit of heaven.  4 grams of fat vs. 10 of regular chips, they use sea salt, they crunch, and to me taste like regular chips minus the grease.  As usual, things that taste good and are made healthy cost more than the high fat item, that is just the way it seems to work.  However, this treat in my opinion is worth your money, as so many other healthy treats are expensive and taste not so great.  I hope you will enjoy them I do and my family does too.

These are by far, the best "healthy" chip in the biz! Parmesan Garlic has got to be the best flavor, but sour cream n onion come in at a close second. I order these, box after box, and have never been disappointed. If you are on the fence about whether to try them, go for it!

review/summary: This picky eater loves them!
review/text: I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is "sweet" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account.

WOW ~ very tasty!  around $1.25 a bag with 3 servings (I open the bag and immediately put them in snack bags), it's about 50 cents a bag.  Well worth it with a weight watcher points plus value of 1 !  These are also fantastic by crumbling them on top of casseroles after cooking.  They have a lot of flavor to offer!  I can't say enough about them.  Buy and find out for yourself ~ give yourself a treat!

review/summary: Popchips are amazing!
review/text: An entire bag of the 3-ounce Popchips are only 360 calories and are very low in fat. I can snack on this or even replace lunch with some of them. There is just the right amount of salt and, despite being produced very unlike traditional chips, the expected crunch is still present. The only complaint I have is that the material of the chip is actually fairly coarse and if you're eating them quickly, I find the roof of my mouth gets a little raw.

review/text: I have tried all of the flavors of Popchips and the Original is my favorite.  You know those chips Munchos that you get at convenience stores?  Well, these kind of remind me of them but they are: 1) tastier, 2) less salty, 3) less processed tasting and 4) better for you.  These are great snacking chips, good with dip, but definitely great on their own.  Crunchy and delicious!  If you like potato chips, you will definitely like Popchips.  Only thing that is weird is that some of the bags are saltier than others - I am not sure why.

review/summary: Healthier alternative for chip fix
review/text: In the last 8 years or so, there's been a potato chip Renaissance in the US.  I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a "sometimes" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer.

review/text: As any dieter knows, it is difficult to give up one's favorite snacks, especially if you crave salty, crispy chips.  I have kept 40 pounds off for 2 years, and these Popchips have been my go to snack; in fact I EAT THEM EVERY DAY!!  They fill my craving for salty chips for very few calories.  One small bag does it for me.  I like the original, but the other flavors are also good!  Without these, I may have had to eat regular chips and had difficulty keeping my weight off.  Popchips are a dieter's dream!

review/summary: YUMMY, YUMMY a little bit of love for your Tummy
review/text: Hey!!  these things taste good. At first I thought they would be like Pringles," which I don't care for " but they are not. Hard to explain since I don't know what to compare them too. I guess I would call them light and fluffy and yet nice and crisp with a great natural flavor.<br /><br /> These have taken some of the guilt out of eating this type of snack for me. I love potato chips but they are loaded with lots of unhealthy things. I'm not saying these are healthy, just a lot less unhealthy than chips.<br /><br /> For starters these are all natural with very little fat and fairly low in carbs for a food of this type. My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.<br /><br /> Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide.

review/summary: Extraordinary Chips
review/text: Popchips are no ordinary chips. What's in them is as good as what's not in them.<br />No preservatives. No artificial flavors. No saturated fat. No gluten ingredients.<br />Popchips are thicker than ordinary chips. They're crunchy ,zesty, tasty, and not overly salty. I like that there's no greasy residue on my hands after eating some.<br /><br />The chips are uniform in size, strong enough to dip, and small enough to make double dipping unnecessary.<br />After sampling these for the first time, I'm looking forward to enjoying these great tasting and satisfying chips again.

review/summary: So much better than "baked" chips
review/text: About 3 months ago I stayed at a hotel in Los Angeles and these chips were in the room, offered comp to hotel guests. I am not sure I would've tried them otherwise, but I am glad I did and now I'm addicted. I am a thin person so it's all about the taste for me, calories are not an issue. I've never really liked the taste of greasy chips, but baked chips seemed so bland. These chips are the best  and you should give them a try. They are tasty and not greasy. My personal favorite is the original potato flavor, but they are all pretty good.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I don't normally review food products but these were so good I wanted to share.

review/text: I tried these chips looking for a healthy snack and they are quite tasty.  The packing/shipping however leaves a lot to be desired.  My box came completely smashed up and all the bags are crushed, with only about 1/4 of the chips in each bag actually intact. The rest are crumbs and dust.  VERY disappointed in the packaging.  There should be a box within a box and some type of protection..ie packing peanuts.

review/summary: The Barbecue are my favorite chips!!!
review/text: PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down. The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy. The calories and fat are very low. No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip. You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem. But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case and get to save money to boot.  These chips are not like regular chips - the texture is different, I assume from the "popping," but once you taste them, you will become addicted, too! One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!

Because if you buy in bulk you save. Having to buy a box of 24... all that extra packaging is going to cost you.

I kept the bag and found them on Amazon and started buying them by the case. Not as salty as regular chips, they also have considerably less grease, more of a tasty rice cake experience than a greasy Lay's chip. I have bought cases of the single-serve bags, and end up giving them to friends and coworkers, who turn around and order them for themselves. Yeah, they are good.

review/text: I loved these chips.  Even my teenager loved these things.  I only got the Salt and Pepper in my first order, but I have now ordered a variety package. I am really looking forward to trying the others.

review/summary: Not for everyone!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE popchips!  So far, I have tried the plain (really don't like these - no flavor at all), BBQ (very nice, rather sweet - I do like these) and Salt & Pepper (by FAR my favorite).  The Salt & Pepper are VERY peppery.  More Pepper than Salt, but I really enjoy the savory bite these have.  I really enjoy the texture of these as well.  Of course I really enjoy rice cakes as well and these are similar in taste "weight" but the texture is more like maybe a thick (yet still light) Munchos, or maybe like a flattened out pork rind.  Like I said however, these are not for everyone.  My husband really doesn't like them much.  So far he only sort-of likes the Salt & Pepper.  I would suggest going on PopChips website and see where they are sold locally, around me they are sold at Target Stores.

review/summary: Warning: will cause bad breathe (but oh, so delicious)
review/text: These chips are very very good. The flavoring on them is the perfect bbq flavor. Unfortunately they leave you with terrible breath (maybe don't eat them before going in for a kiss or talking in someone's face!).<br /><br />They have an odd crisp that's unsettling at first, but if you give it a try, you get used to it, and will most likely enjoy it. You eat them expecting that crunch of a potato chip, but are greeted by something more airy. It's a pretty unique texture that's not much like what I've eaten before.<br /><br />They are not baked or fried, but popped. Which means less calories and fat. They also seem to have the ability to fill me up even though the bag is small (smaller than most I think). So that is a double win.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend trying these in store before investing in a big box of these unless you are adventurous (or generous enough to give away if they displease you)...but DO try them!

review/summary: LOVE these chips!
review/text: I was lucky to have ordered chips on a Virgin America flight and was so excited to see them on Amazon!  They are light and crispy and they do not have MSG or anything bad in them.  They only have about 100 calories per bag and around 3 grams of fat.  I love them!  If you are a chip lover, try them!

review/summary: Much better than I thought
review/text: I only had the BBQ flavor since the variety pack was OOS at the time I ordered. This was the first time I ate these and they are much better than I expected. I read the reviews and saw that it got a lot of praises, but still skeptical since people's taste buds aren't the same. Once I received it, tried a bag and these are great. They aren't greasy at all and pack a lot of flavor. I rather eat these whenever I feel like I need a snack than original potatoes chips or something that's a bit greasy.<br /><br />Either way, these are great. Go to their website and see if you can find a vendor near you. Buy a bag to try out and if you love it, just keep getting more from your retail store or buy 'em cheaper here on Amazon!

review/summary: Great introduction to these chips
review/text: Okay, I personally loved how these chips taste. They are super crunchy and flavorful. I chose to take away one star because the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor was way too salty. BBQ was my favorite. Next time I order, I am getting just the BBQ. They taste just like the greasy unhealthier versions made by other brands. The Cheddar was good but you can tell it was a healthy version of this flavor chips. The rest of the flavors I would say taste as they normally do, nothing special or out of the typical range of those flavors.

review/text: Popchips are quite yummy and 5-star product! They have the baked potatoe crisps' texture, but the mini rice cakes' thickness and size. The are healthier than most snack foods, especially in the single serving packs.  My favorite flavors are the BBQ, Cheddar, and Orginal. However, all the varieties are worth a tasty and worth a try.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: Can't say enough about these chips.  They are only 3 Weight watchers points and are very satisfying.  Hard to believe they are healthy.  I like the portion control of single serve bags for myself and they are quick to pack in a lunch.  One of these bags is a lot more filling than a small bag of chips and taste even better.  I also bought the 3 ounce bags since my entire family loves these. Try these once and you will be hooked.

review/summary: These things are sooooo addictive
review/text: These things are great. I have tried most of the flavors and each one is great. When you open your first bag and put a popchip in your mouth and start eating it, it has a very different texture than you would expect, At-least for me, I did not know what to expect for the texture, and the first few I ate I was I was not sure if I would like it, but then the flavors started to do a happy dance in my mouth, and I got use to the texture and now I cannot get enough of these. They are very addictive, like a legal drug.. They are filling, low in calories and fat. They are my new favorite chips.<br /><br />I recommend going to the website and sending the company an email to let them know what you think of the chips. They are excited to hear what you think and may send you some coupons just for emailing them.<br /><br />If you have never tried these, do it, they are worth it. This variety pack is worth it, good price, great chips. I am eating a bag of bbq while I write this and have a bag of plain popchips waiting for me later. For a chip like this, I didn't have high expectations for the plain chips. Some low fat chips and foods that don't have seasoning taste bland and not work it, not these, even the plain chips have great flavor.

review/text: I dislike most "diet" snacks -- like baked  potato chips. But the barbecue pop chips taste as good or better than most non-diet snacks. I did not care for the vinegar and salt & pepper varieties -- and haven't tried the others yet -- but the BBQ chips are great. I make sure I always have these in the house.

review/summary: The best chips EVER!
review/text: PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down.  The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy.  The calories and fat are very low.  No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip.  You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem.  But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case.  One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!

review/text: After reading the positive reviews about the variety packs, I picked up a bag at my local pharmacy.<br />At 100 calories per bag, this is a great snack that has a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Like their bag states, they are not fried (bad for you),  they are not baked (no taste),  but "popped",  which gives them a slightly thicker but lighter and crispy taste.<br /><br />They really are good.  Try a bag when you get a chance...if you haven't fully kicked all your junk food habits, you'll be glad you did!!

These taste great and have a decent amount in the bags- there enough to satisfy me. They are not bland tasting like some baked chips.  I regularly order these and the BBQ flavor.  I have tried many other Popchip flavors (in the big bags) and these are my personal favorites! I don't know how them make them taste so great for so little calories- but thanks Popchips!
