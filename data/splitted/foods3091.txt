review/summary: Best K cup for coffee lovers!
review/text: My husband thought the Keurig coffee maker was just another gadget, only to be used when guests wanted to make their own choice for flavored coffees.  When I purchased a small box of this  extra bold coffee, he said it was the best coffee he has ever had...home or in a restaurant!  I purchased this larger box, and he said, "Why don't we put the Keurig in the kitchen, and put our 12 cup coffee maker away"!  He is now having less cups of coffee...enjoying it much more...and absolutely no waste!

review/summary: Excellent In Cereal Or A Smoothie..Dairy Free!...
review/text: Westsoy brand soy milk(in choices of Plain and Vanilla at Ralph's grocery stores) is one of the only brands so far, that I have found that has an unsweetened choice.If you have a Trader Joe's market near you, you may also find their own brand in the unsweetened variety. I try to stay away from sugar and I have a really really bad relationship with dairy products, and started using this several years ago. I have found that almost anything I used with milk, I can use this instead. The only time I prefer milk is in my coffee, and even then I use "Lactaid", which is a lactose free milk. Coffee-wise, I like the creamier consistency better, and the soymilk tends to break up in coffee and it's not pretty.<br /><br />I use Soymilk in my cereal, both hot and cold, and it's a wonderful replacement for milk or ice cream when used in a smoothie, with some ice and fruit(or any flavor you want to add.) Works great as a glass of soy with any meal.A refreshing taste, that, after a while you may even think is better than milk. The Vanilla, which is naturally flavored, gives just a hint of flavor to make it a little different then the plain for a little variety. But the Plain is good too.<br /><br />Ingredients are simply: Filtered Water and whole organic soybeans(vanilla flavored has also natural flavoring added)<br /><br />Nutritional Info:- It's a a great source of Protein, with 9 grm. per 8 oz. serving,and 46 mg isoflavones, it also supplies 4% calcium and 10% iron in each serving. Per serving it supplies 90 calories(original flavor), 4.5g Fat, 0.5saturated fat, 0 g of trans, 2.5 polyunsat fat,1g monosat fat. NO cholesterol(this is always a big plus for me),30mg sodium 300 mg potassium 4 gr dietary fiber and 1g sugars (not added but coming from the ingredients). The only thing it lacks is the Vit D that is added to milk, so you may have to check around and find another source for that of something you like.<br /><br />Packaged in a carton with an easy pour recloseable spout, it has a pretty good shelf life(several months at least), and should be refrigerated once it's open, at which point it is usually good for about a week to 10 days. At the time of this review,I thought these 64 oz cartons were a really nice deal, but then I saw the shipping cost- yikes!. But prices change and a better deal may come along so compare at time of purchase. I'll still go to Ralph's for the 32 oz cartons for now.<br /><br />For dairy free diets, Westsoy is a good, healthy choice.<br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy....Laurie

review/summary: Product quality and packaging not worth exorbitant increase in price.
review/text: This product was last on the shelves of local markets for less than $4.00 per 64oz box. When I last ordered through the online vendor, other than Amazon, the quality of packing was not sufficient to withstand the direct order of smaller units (4) for the 64 oz box. The product arrived with boxes leaking or the seal no longer air-tight.<br /><br />When picking up at the stores , it had leaked on the shelves, the boxes were often dented and damaged, no longer airtight and did the same when shipped to my door.<br /><br />Finally, I made a larger purchase locally of as many as 6 boxes of 64oz, however today as I opened the last box well within the freshness date, it had begun to form 'skins' of yellow soy, most likely the fatty portion of the bean.<br /><br />This has been really disconcerting since the original product, Westsoy Original Organic Unsweetened Soymilk, was delivered without any additives, at an affordable price with a quality that was excellent. Now, it appears that Amazon has become one of the primary, if not exclusive distributors of the products, without managing the quality.<br /><br />While the price is going out-of-site, the quality and packaging is not keeping up with that price.<br />This company Westsoy.biz and Amazon for that matter, need to take a better look at their market and meet the demands for quality co-measurate with price.

review/summary: Good deal
review/text: My wife and I have been looking for a box of inexpensive Shabbat candles.  Our local shul didn't have these Neriot candles and other places online charged as much for shipping as the cost for the candles.<br /><br />These were a great deal, 4 boxes here for the price of 2 elsewhere, plus free prime shipping.  They arrived quickly and the box we opened look good - no noticeable broken candles or other damages.  The boxes look a little different from the photo, but the brand is called "Menora - The Candles Word" with a PO Box from Tel Aviv, which I assume is where these were made since it doesnt list any place of manufacture.  The box lists the candles as kosher.<br /><br />You need to burn these in a special glass, and we haven't lit any of these to confirm the 4 hour estimate, but will report back if the time is much less than 4 hours.<br /><br />So far, very glad to have found these on Amazon.  4 boxes will last us at least a year, probably 2.

Perhaps it is best to order this during cold months where nothing will melt? Or maybe they fixed the issue, either way it arrived perfectly, with minimal damage to the popcorn.

The bottles come in a tin filled with generous straw material for padding/aesthetic appeal.<br />Though the tin isn't all that well-crafted and can be squeezed, quite flimsy, the oils stand by themselves, excellent taste and aroma. None of the infusions are overpowering and will add a nice dash of flavor to anything you could use standard olive oil for.<br />Be aware that these bottles are very small, only containing 100mL of oil each but because they are pungent with flavor, a little bit should go a long way.

review/summary: Great for people with liver problems!
review/text: Ever since I was diagnosed with Fatty Liver( a very painful condition where the liver is so filled with fat that it stops functioning right and can not process sugars, fats, and carbs correctly. So when you eat it causes a horrid cramping pain under your right ribs) I stopped eatting...anything. Which is pretty bad too. Then I started trying different bars and found that many cause my Fatty liver to hurt bad until I ran onto these. Many of the bars are based in chocolate which is not my go to food even before I was diagnosed. So I am always looking for tasty bars OTHER then chocolate.<br />The Orange Smoothie Nugo bar and the Vannilla Yogurt Nugo bars fit that bill well. The round rice things are softer and smaller then most bars which is better for me. They have a light sweet flavor that is very tasty and not alot of sugar substitutes/fat(which a low functioning liver can NOT process well). I think they are marketed to diabetics and I would totally reccomend them to anyone with that condition as well.<br />I wish they sold them more locally and maybe at a better price but hey you can't have everything!!<br /> It is good with coffe in the morning(VERY hard for me to eat in the am but have to if I want to keep my blood sugar balance and metabilizum going all day) I add a piece of fruit or as a snack with water....or to replace a weak moment where you'd break out the candy bars...you just break out the orange smoothie bar!!<br /><br />So if you are looking for a tasty nutritonal bar that is fruity vs chocolaty then this IS the bar to buy!!<br />I thank you for reading and I hope you have a happy healthy day:)

He has tried the chocolate and chocolate peanut butter - and various dark chocolate flavors. And he's tried many other major brand protein bars. It's tricky because he has braces, but he seems fine with these. They are - like others have said - like Rice Krispie treats! They are healthier than a lot of similar products on the market, too!

review/summary: It's good
review/text: When the Senseo's first came out, we started receiving free ones to test various coffees. I admit I'm a bit of a coffee snob and come from a long line of coffee snobs. My Dad roasts his own beans and when you've had fresh roasted? From a high end brewing system? Heaven. We have the latest model and for Senseo coffee having tried everything out there, honestly this flavor is very good. But that's with the qualification of it's Senseo coffee most of which kinda is on par with crappy diner coffee or instant. This is about the quality of Starbucks. Mass produced and flavored, but drinkable. I bought this because we have relatives in town visiting our baby and honestly, they just want a cup of joe when they crawl out of bed and don't seem to mind what it tastes like as long as it's fresh. I don't have the time or patience with an infant to wait on them so this was an easy solution that each person visiting can do themselves when they wake up at various times throughout the morning without risking anyone messing up the fabulous coffeemaker my family gave me over Christmas (these relatives have broken two similar machines in the past....sigh!). I do like the greener pod factor over the plastic k-cups and with going through so much of these, I'd feel terrible filling my recycle bin instead of our compost pile. So an easy fix and a win-win. If you love the Senseo coffee, this is worth it.

review/summary: Doesn't work with my Senseo
review/text: I can't seem to make a strong cup of coffee with these pods, even using two at once. The pods fit perfectly, but I think the problem is the pods are packed too tightly or the filter paper does not allow adequate water flow. They seem to swell into a ball shape and the water then flows around the pod and not extracting a lot of coffee. I'm going to try to engineer a fix and will update the review.

review/summary: Robust and strong....like coffee should be
review/text: If you like weak, wimpy coffee, then this coffee is not for you.<br />  But if you like strong, robust, tasteful coffee, with a soupcon undertone of bitterness, then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V2SUU4">Java One French Roast Coffee, 14-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a> is the best choice that I have found. I used to use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026VJI9K">Senseo Kona Blend Coffee (10% Kona Coffee Blend), 16-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a>; it was good, but then when Amazon's inventory was temporarily exhausted, I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBJ3U2">Senseo Colombia Blend Coffee, 16-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a> which was stronger. But now, Amazon doesn't seem to carry Senseo brands anymore--or Senseo doesn't sell thru Amazon (which is the former's loss). In any event, I needed coffee that featured pods that would fit my Senseo machine, and I serendipitously stumbled upon Java One French Roast, and I'm glad I did!<br />  Further, the Java pods--unlike the Senseo pods--are individually sealed in air-tight wrapping, which means the coffee stays fresher, longer. Java pods contain a bit more coffee so I have to use the two-cup holder because it's deeper. Java costs more than the Senseos, but, in my mind it's worth it! Try it--you'll like it!

review/summary: Ruining world's best beans
review/text: Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee is one of, if not THE best coffees in the world.  Because of it's unique (and therefore valuable) flavor it is roasted very lightly.  It is one of the few coffees in the world that is smooth, when roasted lightly.  They should be almost cinnamon in color.  To my dismay when I opened the bag of Magnum, I saw oily over-roasted beans.  As expected, from their appearance, what I tasted was that over-roasted smokey/charcoal flavor overpowering any qualities of the beans.  IF these are truly high quality Jamaican Blue Mountain beans (which for the price they should be) it's a crime against nature to ruin them like this.  Leave this level of roasting to starbucks, to cover up the horrid quality of beans.  I bought these for less than half what they are listed for and even at that price, I give them a 1-star.

review/text: Well just received my Jamaican coffee.  The aroma upon opening bag was incredible!  It permeated the house! Brewed some using a French press.  I immediately noticed a nice buttery smooth full body taste but the more I drank it the more I noticed this slight burnt after taste.  The coffee was supposed to be a medium roast.  All I can say is for my taste preference a medium-dark roast is a little bit to strong for me. It unsettled my stomach,  I could not even finish my cup of coffee.  O well I guess its back to "Country Traders" Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee!.

review/summary: Underwelmed
review/text: I was quite interested in drinking this coffee after reading the label. I was so interested I spent 1 hour cleaning out my coffee machine to make sure that I was not going to contaminate the taste with any previous beans I had used. I bought this from costco, as far as I can see it was roasted 5 months before I received it. The beans I have received have been over roasted and do not have that super smooth subtle taste, in fact its a little burned with a hint of bitter. I am drinking this coffee as I write this review to make sure its accurate to the taste I am getting.  The coffee I have received does not match the description of "The best coffee in the world". If this is as good as it gets I would not bother drinking coffee. Fortunately there is much better. I'm generally disappointed with this batch.<br /><br />In fact I just threw my first cup away and remade it turning the water temperature on my machine to medium (previously high) to give it the fairest possibly chance. No difference.<br /><br />I usually buy my coffee from an outlet that roasts my beans on the day I order them. If you didn't know fresh beans lose their best after 2 weeks unless carefully kept out of sunlight, air, moisture and other strong smelling products as the beans absorb other aromas. This could account for some of the loss of the subtle flavor but does not account for the hint of bitter/over roasting.<br /><br />My advice is buy from a supplier where you know they treated the coffee correctly.

review/summary: IMHO, the best dry cat food out there
review/text: Innova Evo is bar none the best dry cat food out there and believe me, I have tried them all.  I have had multiple cats all my life and I do try to feed them a good diet, okay, better than my own in a lot of respects.<br /><br />Evo is strong in natural ingredients and low in grain, which I believe has caused a lot of problems with obesity and diabetes in our domestic pets.<br /><br />The improvement in my household is pretty dramatic.  My three cats have more energy, better coats, less throwing up, and more solid stools than ever before.  The girls, who were pretty much 'furniture with fur' are demanding to play at least half an hour a day.  So far, no weight loss, but they are eating a smaller portion (about 2.5 ounces per day for cat) and are not demanding a lot more.<br /><br />One caveat:  do not start this food abruptly.  Evo is rich and you will need to introduce it gradually.  So, start with 3 or 4 parts your current cat food to one part Evo and gradually increase the amount of Evo as your cats will tolerate it.  If you go much faster, you might give your cats diarrhea or other stomach upset.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, September 2008

review/summary: Great food, feed sensibly
review/text: This is great food; it has natural ingredients and is formulated to be as close as possible to a cat's natural diet. I switched my kitten to this food with NO issues, not even the smelly stools others complain about and I'll explain why. I am into body building and diet and I know that when you switch from bad food to good food, you actually need to eat less and adjust from there.<br /><br />The smelly stools occur when there is undigested (unused) protein in the stools. Thus you need to balance your cat's food intake and exercise so that he's getting enough food for his or her energy needs. Too little and your cat will definitely let you know, too much and the stools will let you know.<br /><br />I feed my cat Innova Wet and Dry food, leaving dry food out all day with one serving of wet food in the morning or at lunch time. Unless my cat has finished all his food early on in the day, I don't feed him any more of either; no matter how much he meows (it took about a week or two to change his routine). Also, if he's finished or nearly finished his food by the time I go to bed, I don't refill his bowl till morning.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend consulting your vet and watching your cat closely while adjusting his feeding. Watch for energy levels, alertness, responsiveness and overall demeanor.

review/summary: Tastes Great!
review/text: Ok, i'm not really sure about that one. In January I adopted my very first cat. I haven't had one since I was 10! This is mainly due to living in apartments and allergies. My cat is a 2 1/2 year old Maine Coon. It's REALLY fat and weighs about 14lbs. He has a belly that hangs down to the floor almost.<br /><br />After hearing about all those bad pet foods a few years back, I did some research into what pet foods were the best. Decided to try this. I'll admit that it's NOT cheap at all, but it doesn't bother me. Why? It costs me the amazon price, but one bag can last me months!<br /><br />I did some research into weight loss for cats and tried to feed him the correct amount, but unfortunately after nearly a year, he hasn't lost any weight on this food. I think he just doesn't get enough exercise. He does have a ton of energy and is always running around it seems, but he still likes to sleep a LOT. Due to this food (i'd imagine) his fur is shiny and soft. Other than the weight problem he seems like a healthy cat.<br /><br />Sadly, I had to switch pet foods. This might sound really silly and gross to admit, but this food makes his poo extremely stinky! It stinks up the entire house when he "goes". No cat litter on earth will stop it. I've tried different litters and boxes, not even thinking it was the food. It most definitely was. I clear the litter box every single day, but being "bombed out" is not fun. Somedays it really made me ALMOST not want a cat!<br /><br />I switched to Wellness Healthy Weight Cat Food (which seems even more expensive) and the problem went away.<br /><br />I also did a taste test on my cat. I sat out a bowl of EVO and Wellness Cat foods and he preferred the wellness brand. He actually told me this. Seriously though, he would eat the Wellness, take a few bites of the EVO and then leave it alone. This doesn't really mean anything. The best tasting cat food is not always the best for a cat.<br /><br />The EVO food is probably of a higher quality, but i'm not sure. I'd imagine either brand is good.

review/summary: Wonderful!  Absolutely worth the price and effort to find!
review/text: I began purchasing this food after moving into my own apartment with my cat Lily.  I had been buying her store bought cat food, but started researching the different foods to try to find the best one.  I found this, and started her on it.  After a few weeks/months, I noticed a big difference...more energy, shinier and softer coat, less poop.<br /><br />I now have two cats (Lily and a stray I adopted off the street)who are living with another family member for the time being.  I still buy this food and take it up to them, it's just worth it that much!  The difference in the stray's appearance is amazing, he has gone from a slightly dirty looking black cat to a silky, shiny, super soft black cat.<br /><br />This food is absolutely worth it.  You are feeding the cats a VERY good diet, they actually eat less (my 2 cats get one cup of food per day, they may not even eat all of it), they poop less, and the poo is firmer and less smelly.<br /><br />The price seems high, but when you factor in the economy of the food, it is not bad at all.  One of these big bags will feed my 2 cats for over 2 months!<br /><br />I have no doubt that if I continue feeding this to my 2 cats, they will live long, healthy, and happy lives.

review/summary: Great cat food
review/text: My last cat became diabetic because I didn't understand the damage that most commercial dry foods inflict. By switching that cat to a canned food diet and monitoring his carbohydrates, I got him off insulin and he lived another five years after his diagnosis.<br /><br />When I got my current cat I was determined to never go through that again. Imagine my dismay upon realizing that this new cat gives a whole new meaning to the word "fussy"...and that he'd cheerfully starve to death rather than eat something just because I decided it would be good for him. Unfortunately, most canned foods were on the list.<br /><br />I eventually did find some excellent canned foods that he would eat, but I also discovered this dry food. As others have mentioned, it's grain-free, which is my highest priority in a cat food - canned or dry. After researching the other dry foods out there, I've come to the conclusion that this is the ONLY one I'll feed my cat. (It's a good thing he likes it!)<br /><br />I hope others get to the same place I did and realize that too many of the foods on the market today are downright toxic. I also hope others realize this before their cat's diet turns into a chronic health problem. Because sure, this food is more expensive than Meow Mix and even the "premium" foods like Iams and Science Diet...but it's still far, far cheaper to choose a more expensive food than it is to battle a chronic health problem.<br /><br />(That said, I would recommend doing some comparison shopping and find places where it's on sale. You may be able to find it cheaper elsewhere.)

review/summary: Excellent food for cats
review/text: This is an excellent product for cats, it came highly recommended from a vet about 6 or 7 years ago when I had an immune compromised cat. It was the only food that she could eat and keep down, causing her to finally gain weight after losing enough to be life-threatening. That kitty has since passed on, but I put my kitties back on it about 6 months ago and their coats look great, they are more active, and my kitty with sensitive stomach throws up much less. I even received the product from the seller a few days earlier than expected.

review/summary: 3rd eyelid problem
review/text: I have 2 cats that I slowly introduced Evo to.  One cat does fine with increasing percentages of Evo, while the other cat, even with small amounts of Evo, had terrible diarrhea, flatulence, and she started showing her 3rd eyelids.  So I've slowly switched her back to greater concentrations of her original food, and her intestinal problems are resolving along with the appearance of her 3rd eyelids.  Weird. Has this happened to anyone else?

review/summary: Healther Cat due to this food
review/text: My 14 year old cat was doing somewhat poorly.  We switched her to EVO Turkey and Chicken Dry Cat Food and she has done so much better.  It is a bit costly, but for her it is well worth it since I truly believe it will extend her life a bit longer.  She loves this food and her weight has been more even since she has been changed to this cat food.  We hope they never change the formula because so many cats have benefited by the better ingredients in this food.  Cats don't need all the Carbs and this cat food is exactly what agrees with my cat, Molly.

review/summary: Good for diabetic cat.
review/text: I have 2 eleven year old cats.  One is diabetic.  After feeding EVO for 2 weeks my diabetic cat has more energy and is acting more like normal.  He has even started going outdoors again which he hadn't shown an interest in for 6 weeks.  The only bad thing is that his stools sometimes have a strong odor.  However the stools of my female cat do NOT have that strong odor.  Both cats like EVO and I would definitely recommend it, especially for diabetic cats.

review/summary: Excellent food for cats
review/text: I bought the large bag because my cats had been on it a few years ago, so I knew they would eat it and enjoy it. Their coats are better, I'm not finding kitty barf all over the house, and they have much more energy. One of my cats who was formerly fat and lazy is now running around the house and playing more. It's expensive but it's worth it. I think the dyes in the store cat food were causing my cats to throw up so much, and again, that hasn't been happening with the Evo.

review/summary: A great, grain-free choice.
review/text: I recently adopted two kittens after the death of my 16 year old cat from kidney failure. Like many cat owners, I knew nothing about cat nutrition, and I assumed if I bought food from my vet, or if I stayed away from the "bottom shelf" brands at the grocery store, I was doing well by my cat. I don't think I'd ever bothered to read the ingredients on a bag of food, and I certainly knew nothing about the issues of feeding cats corn, brewer's rice, by-products, etc. But a volunteer at the shelter recommended that I feed the kittens a mixture of dry Chicken Soup for the Kitten Lover's Soul Dry Food, Chicken Formula, 15 Pound Bag and canned Wellness Canned Cat Food, Kitten Recipe, 24-Pack of 3 oz. Cans, and she encouraged me to read Pet Food Ratings (Google it - it's the first result) for information on nutrition and dry food recommendations. After research on that site, as well as others, I decided to switch from Chicken Soup to Evo, in order to keep my cats on a grain-free diet. They made the transition to Evo with no problem, and I'm continuing to mix it with Wellness canned, and they seem to really enjoy it.<br /><br />I know that not everyone can afford to feed their cats these high-end brands, and it's really unfortunate that the cheapest brands are absolute garbage. But I do hope that others who are just unaware of the vast nutritional differences in these products will see the light as I have!<br /><br />To hopefully save others the time on some research, I'll suggest a few other highly recommended, nutritious options you may want to consider:<br /><br />Grain-free dry:<br />1) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019QIXW6">Orijen Regional Poultry and Fish Grain-Free Dry Cat & Kitten Food, 5.5lb</a><br />2) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O2APH2">Wellness CORE Grain-Free, Original Formula Adult Cat and Kitten Food, 5lb.14oz</a><br />3) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001709GF2">Merrick Before Grain #1 Chicken Dry Cat Food, 11.1 Pound Bag</a><br /><br />Grain-free canned:<br />1) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7A5X0">EVO Cat & Kitten Canned Cat Food</a><br />2) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ANCEI6">Wellness Grain-Free Canned Cat Food, CORE Chicken/Turkey/Chicken Liver Recipe, 24-Pack of 5-1/2-Ounce Cans</a><br />3) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P8JNG0">Merrick Before Grain #1 Chicken Pat&eacute; Style Cat Food, 5.5 Ounce Can (24 Count Case)</a>

review/summary: The best cat food!
review/text: When our cat became diabetic our Vet recommended this food b/c it is the best for this illness.  Have had a hard time getting it lately in our area so I started searching online.  The price was amazing, reviews good with the company.  For $20.00 less I was able to get the big bag and when it was shipped it was here within 2 days, about a week less than was quoted.  Was almost out of food so it was great.  Would order again from this company as long as price, shipping (free) and quality is acceptable.

review/summary: Best food you can buy for your little carnivore.
review/text: So far, this is the best cat food money can buy.  Cats are carnivores, which means they gain very little nutrients from grains. vegetables, and such.  Evo cat food has absolutely no grains and very few vegetables and fruits, perfect for a carnivore. In the ingredient list, almost everything is comprehensible to the general public.  But if you are unfamiliar with an ingredient, research it online so you know what your cat is eating.  In comparison, the next time you go to the grocery store, have a look at the ingredients in their cat food.  All of the brands will have crap that can be quite unhealthy for your cat. Not to forget to mention that grain is often the first or second ingredient! This is such a high quality food, you cat will have to eat less to get what he/she needs.  This 15lb bag lasts me over 3 months for my 17.7lb cat.<br /><br />- A veterinary technician with a beloved cat

review/summary: Wonderful cat food
review/text: My last cat became diabetic because I didn't understand the damage that most commercial dry foods inflict. By switching that cat to a canned food diet and monitoring his carbohydrates, I got him off insulin and he lived another five years after his diagnosis.<br /><br />When I got my current cat I was determined to never go through that again. Imagine my dismay upon realizing that this new cat gives a whole new meaning to the word "fussy"...and that he'd cheerfully starve to death rather than eat something just because I decided it would be good for him. Unfortunately, most canned foods were on the list.<br /><br />I eventually did find some excellent canned foods that he would eat, but I also discovered this dry food. As others have mentioned, it's grain-free, which is my highest priority in a cat food - canned or dry. After researching the other dry foods out there, I've come to the conclusion that this is the ONLY one I'll feed my cat. (It's a good thing he likes it!)<br /><br />I hope others get to the same place I did and realize that too many of the foods on the market today are downright toxic. I also hope others realize this before their cat's diet turns into a chronic health problem. Because sure, this food is more expensive than Meow Mix and even the "premium" foods like Iams and Science Diet...but it's still far, far cheaper to choose a more expensive food than it is to battle a chronic health problem.<br /><br />(That said, I would recommend doing some comparison shopping and find places where it's on sale. You may be able to find it cheaper elsewhere.)

review/text: I settled on EVO after researching the healthiest available dry foods.  Tried to give them Wellness, my cats didn't really like it.  When I switched them to EVO, they did have loose stools at first.  However, being on a low carb diet myself, the low amount of grains can cause this initially.  Now, they not only love the taste of EVO, they are both regular and have beautiful, thick coats that everybody immediately praises when they see them.  I wholeheartedly recommend this.

review/summary: EVO caused my cat to lose her fur
review/text: I had been feeding both my 11-year old cats EVO for at least 5 years. About a year ago, my black and white tuxedo started developing bald patches on her belly and she would lick constantly. The fur loss gradually spread to the inner parts of her hind quarters and the sides. I knew she wasn't affected by parasites, since my other cat wasn't experiencing any issues (they both stay indoors in a 2-bedroom apartment). When I found out EVO had been sold to another company, it clicked with me that perhaps the formula changed and the ingredients were being sourced differently. I switched to another cat food that also doesn't contain grain, and sure enough, her fur started growing back within a few weeks. Whew!

review/summary: Gave my cat bloody loose smelly stools
review/text: I normally feed a quality canned food, but I was going away for a week so I was seeking a quality dry food for the cat to eat during this time. I switched the cat over by mixing the old and new foods in increasing ratios for a week prior (this was not a sudden food change). Things seemed alright at first, but after on 100% of this dry food, the cat developed loose, bloody, horrid smelling stools. However, I think this cat may have a fish allergy, so it might be the herring in this food. After switching the cat back to the canned food, the stools went back to being their normal firm and virtually odorless within a couple days. Also the cat seemed to start getting fat eating this dry food, whereas she maintains a fairly normal weight when free fed the quality canned food.

review/summary: Great quality food for your cat
review/text: I have two cats, one who is almost 4 and quite overweight and the other almost a year. I've been feeding them what I thought was decent food until I really educated myself on what a healthy cat needs to thrive and what's inside most cat foods...lots of grain fillers that have no business being in a strict carnivore's diet. My main goal was to get the older heavy cat healthier and start the young guy off on the right foot, so after reading about the quality ingredients in this food, I was ready to give it a shot. First things first, they both eat this food at will, with no hesitation. They also had no issues switching to this food, and their stool is firm and less smelly like others have mentioned too. To my amazement, I found that within a week or two on EVO, the older cat seemed to have gotten a new spark in his activity level and was becoming more friendly and wanting to be handled more, like when he was a kitten. It's now been about a month and both have an amazing silky smooth coat, they're playing like crazy, and overall they just appear to be so much healthier and happier....definitely will stick with EVO and will recommend it to everyone who wants a healthy, happy cat.

I bought a case of Evo cat food at Petfoodirect and my cats refuse it it it, absolutely.  No matter what I do, they will not budge. Even when they are obviously very hungry and start actively demanding food (like throwing things off the shelves and tearing up packages), they will not touch the freshly opened Evo in their bowls.  I am not sure what's in that food that turns them off completely, but it upsets me that I now have to throw out cans of unopened cat food.  Advise to those of you who are thinking of purchasing Evo -- try one can at a time first and see how it goes.

One of my cats did fine on this food, and the other had very bad diarrhea for over a week until I switched to another food. My vet said that this was not uncommon and that, like people, all digestive tracts are made differently. If your cat has a problem on this food for more than a couple of days, it's probably best try another.

review/summary: My mom said this was not as flavorful as other "Extra Bolds"
review/text: This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:<br /><br />Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.<br /><br />There! Now you know.<br /><br />My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and she's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups she's tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. She's tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.

review/summary: Weak, even on small cup setting
review/text: This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chef's reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and it's 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.  Stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee.

review/summary: Really Disappointed
review/text: I wanted to like this coffee, I did. We've tried other Wolfgang Puck K-Cups and have been pleasantly surprised. This just did not impress us. Bitter aftertaste, and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor. Smells great while brewing, but just does not live up to it in the cup. I'm really disappointed because I now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink! Great price though.

review/text: I purchased these for my mom and she loves them!  She does not like bold coffee flavors, but is more into the sweet and more flavorful varieties.  This one combines the taste of the islands with a smooth, nutty flavor.  Amazon had a GREAT price on these and this is something that I can actually recommend!

review/summary: Great taste, lousy cup
review/text: This is a good decaf coffee, but I've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. It's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess.

review/summary: Island Escape!
review/text: I tried this flavor within a variety pack and LOVED IT!  I usually add cream and sugar to my coffee.  With this k cup I added coconut creamer and found that I did not have to add any sugar!  It was so sweet and light and tasted just like a pina colada.  I absolutley love this k cup and am planning to sign up for subscribe and save on this one!

review/summary: Just Right and you will love it!
review/text: This Wolfgang Puck coffee tasted great. The vanilla flavoring is just right. Some reviews said it was not so good, not enough flavoring, etc. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here. I have never posted for a product and I have tried many different k-cups. This is a good k-cup and don't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback. I almost hesitated and didn't buy it and then I figured I would give it a shot. It was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor. You will enjoy it. It tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor.

review/summary: Good coffee, but lets clear up the flavors?
review/text: I saw the good reviews of this Jamaica Me Crazy coffee, but the reviewers all seem to wander around whether it has coconut, vanilla, caramel, rum or coffee liqueur flavorings.<br /><br />First off, I'm not getting any coconut from it at all.  Some vanilla, but it mostly tastes like coffee with baileys irish cream in it.<br /><br />In fact, after I drank a cup I had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think I was drinking spiked coffee while we waited for the class to let out! :)<br /><br />But its good.  I recommend it to anyone who likes flavored coffee.  Not really anything else like it and I've tried about 20 different k-cup flavors.

review/summary: Very Smooth Not Acidic
review/text: I used to do the subscribe and save with the Timothy's World Kona, but due to the fact that the price on Timothy's jumped so high, I went to Wolfgang Puck Breakfast in Bed.  Pleasantly surprised, and I must say that I like this one much better than the Kona!  It seems much more smoother, but the taste still retains a nice warm mellow-bold flavor.  Great way to start the day!  Oh, and I love the name of this coffee ;)

review/summary: Too Mild for Me
review/text: I bought this because Amazon had DRASTICALLY increased the price on what I usually buy, so I thought I'd try something new.  I normally drink Coffee People Donut Shop, which is a nice, strong cup of coffee.  This was a little disappointing.  It's called a Medium Roast, but when I brew a large cup (my Keurig has 3 size options), it looks like strong tea - very light in color.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  When I brew the smallest cup possible, it's a tiny bit better, but I prefer a large cup of strong coffee.  Think I may try the Rodeo Drive or Sorrento, but this one is just too weak and light for me.  (Oddly enough, the first time I tried Donut Shop, I thought it was too strong...as I had been used to weaker coffees.  Now that I've started drinking the stronger varieties, it's hard to go back to "brown water.")

review/summary: A must have on my carousel!
review/text: I wasn't expecting this one to be so rich or full!  Yet it has a smoky finish that is typical of a French roast but doesn't taste burnt.  I think alot of times a French roast tastes thin and yet bitter instead of full and smoky, but not this one! Very pleased with it and will definitely order again.  If you like a stronger cup in the morning, without being bitter, give this one a try.

review/summary: A strong yet bitter brew
review/text: As a French Roast fan, I bought this brand of K-cup with high expectations, considering the name attached to it. I was disappointed. It has a hearty aroma and full-bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />If you're a lover of the more robust roasts, I would recommend trying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L41Y8A">Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> instead. It is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick you're likely looking for.
