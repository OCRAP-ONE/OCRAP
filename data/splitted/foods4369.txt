review/summary: SIMPLY THE BEST--BETTER THAN ALL THE REST!!!
review/text: I'm one of the fortunate who for many yrs have lived near the So. San Fran See's factory 'n store and enjoyed that pure goodness that is uniquely See's.  It really is the best!  Unfortunately, my first order thru Amazon arrived damaged and not that mega freshness that I know so well.  At no cost to me, a replacement order was sent immediately and w/ no requirement to return the damaged order.  Replacement order was indeed, that pure 'lit'l slice of heaven on earth' that all See's lovers know so well -- quality, goodness, customer service extraordinaire and total class act the See's way!

review/summary: Yummy candy sticks
review/text: While I didn't purchase these from Amazon, I did purchase them from a local candy shop and I love them.  They taste just like you would expect a candy stick to taste like.  I came on Amazon to find some more because they were SO good!  It's unfortunate that the other reviewer experienced broken candy and wasn't a fan that they were imported.  Regardless of the country of origin these things taste great and are very well made.  Please don't let a country of origin color your feelings on this item.  It's well worth your money.  My favorite is the orange-pineapple flavored sticks.

review/summary: Be warned imported item
review/text: To start all of the sticks arrived broken, which kind of defeats the purpose of ordering stick candy.  I tasted a couple of the broken pieces and they tasted "off."  Upon closer inspection of the tin and wrapping, I learned that this candy is made in Mexico.  That would explain the "off" kind of glue-like taste.  I don't want ANYTHING made in Mexico because products are not regulated as they are here, and there is always something just left of center where stuff from Mexico is concerned--looks pretty to the eye but is horrible tasting, etc.  I feel that this should have been clearly stated upfront that the candy is Mexican so consumers can be aware.

review/text: I have had both of our indoor cats on this food for the past two years.  It was recommended by one of the staff at Petsmart.  It is great for keeping their coats shiny and soft....plus Ginger and Oliver love it.  One of our cats is prone to really dry skin and this food has really helped.  (I'm thrilled to find I can order this on-line, because it's sometimes difficult to find (or sold out of) in the petstores.

review/text: I've tried all of the flavors of this rub, and they're all delicious! Decaf Ginger is no exception: it's so flavorful, and really brings a new dimension to anything I've used it with. I love using it on fish, vegetables or pita. Anything with a subtle flavor really soaks up the flavor of the rub! It's so easy...just sprinkle it on, drizzle with some olive oil and throw it in the oven or on the stove. It's the quickest and easiest way to have a delicious meal that I've found! I'm so happy it's on Amazon now so I don't have to search my local stores for it! I highly recommend it!

review/text: *SAMPLE SUPPLIED BY MANUFACTURER*<br /><br />I love this product. I've been down South and have had true 'Southern sweet tea' and this comes extremely close.  As a matter of fact the tea I used to get down in Georgia and Tennessee was somewhat too sweet for my taste and I used to have to cut it with some unsweetened to keep my New England taste buds happy.<br /><br />This product is a robust tea with just enough sweetness to keep most people happy.  Oddly enough the taste is almost that of a honey being used to sweeten the tea.  Rich tea flavor and bold enough to withstand the watering down that can sometimes seems to  happen when you use the Keuring.<br /><br />You may be able to find this elsewhere for less but I've been finding that these places are usually sold out during the height of the summer and don't carry the iced teas in the winter.  With Amazon it seems that you may be assured to be able to get it whenever you're craving it.

review/summary: Perfect complement to freshly ground coffee and spicing teas
review/text: I first acquired a taste for cardamom when I lived in the Middle East. Both Arabic coffee and Turkish coffee are made with cardamon. The Arabic coffee is difficult to brew because it is made from green coffee beans and green cardamom pods ground together. I have not found a source for green coffee beans where I live. However, Turkish coffee with cardamom is both easy to brew and delicious to my taste.<br /><br />For regular coffee beans I grind a few pods when I am grinding the beans (a little of this goes a long way), and the brewed coffee has a wonderful flavor (not to mention a wonderful aroma while brewing.) Friends find the taste ineffable. I find it familiar and delicious.<br /><br />Another way I use cardamom is to make spiced chai (masala chai). I grind a pod with a part of a stick of cinnamon, clove and a single black peppercorn. I mix it in a half and half water and milk mixture that I bring to a boil, add black tea and grate a piece of ginger (or, when I am lazy, use powdered ginger.) For the chai, a nice touch is to sweeten it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F5K5N2">Goya Panela Brown Sugar Cane 1 Lb - Redonda</a>, known as "jaggery" in India. Or, for convenience, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050IM27Q">Turbinado Sugar - 1 box, 1 lb</a>.<br /><br />To be honest, I sometimes substitute powdered cardamom for pods, such as when I am making a quick Turkish coffee or chai, but when I want to treat myself, I use the pods. Frankly, there is not a ground cardamom I've tried that comes close to grinding the pods right before using them. And for company I never cut corners - these are an essential ingredient that is sure to impress and delight.

review/summary: Lazy, poorly flocculating yeast.
review/text: I loved the price. You can find it for $2 at most stores. Which is a really solid price for a yeast made by a reputable company. Depending on the literature you read, you'll find this described as a "belgian-type" yeast. I don't get that at all. It seems like a very plain, average yeast without any significant character except breadiness and yeastiness.<br /><br />Other than the price, I don't like this yeast. I tried it in a cider and a brown ale. It ferments fast and furious and when its done, that's it. This is a work hard play hard yeast. Mega krausen for maybe 36 hours and then that's it. The cider went from 1.056 to 1.008 in about 36 hours. The brown ale on the other hand started at about 1.060 and stuck at 1.030. I tried the usual stuff, swirling the tank, warm temp, nothing.<br /><br />It finishes at a pretty high OG. It left very little apple character in the cider. Easy drinking but not anything special. I've heard people get good results with this. But I think it's a bit tempermental and in all honest not worth the price. When I have to spend $3.50 to pitch a pack of Nottingham to finish was the $2 pack of S-33 didn't, my yeast cost went to a price where I could have just gotten liquid.<br /><br />Not a great combination -- yeasty, bready, poorly flocculating, inconsistent, tempermental.

review/text: I'm a repeat customer for several years, though I usually buy directly from their website (virtually no difference in price). This is Canadian-grown wild rice, not quite like the U.S. version, even though the species is the same. The grains are considerably thicker and longer than the U.S. kind, but have equivalent or better flavor. It is a bit twitchier to cook, insofar as the "window" between "just popped" and "mush" is somewhat shorter. But, as long as you carefully watch the cooking, you'll be rewarded with an exceptional taste treat. Enjoy!

review/summary: Drinkable, not great
review/text: This coffee is ok, but nothing great, at least in my opinion..  I will not throw it away, but neither will I order any more.  It has that sharp aftertaste that I don't care for.  It isn't as strong as I expected it to be, which could be one reason for my disappointment.  If you like mild coffee and just drink coffee for effect this is a decent and well priced product.  I enjoy coffee and drink it for taste as much as effect.  The packets are easy to open, which I appreciate.

Order it!<br /><br />You can thaw out the slices the way I did if you like.  At 30% power, heat 4 slices in a regular microwave for about 55 seconds.  Don't cover them while you are doing this.  Plus, there are slips of paper between each slice, so you need not cut anything or worry about adhesions.

review/summary: Creamy & Delicious...but...
review/text: Cheesecake arrived within a week of ordering.  Packing was amazing, ice in the pack was still frozen, and so was the cheesecake. We let it thaw to room temperature.  It is delicious, creamy, crust is perfect...but for me personally, it is super-sweet.  Typical of my taste, I just don't like super sweet anything. So, if you have a love of cheesecake that really is 'New YorK' style and really love super-sweet, then this is perfect for you.  For those of us who love creamy cheesecake with a nice crust but are more reserved on the super-sweet, think twice.

review/summary: Update of previous review
review/text: This is a resubmittal of a previous review.  Originally, when I received my cheesecake I was very disappointed with the careless way it had been packaged and delivered - and I said so in my review.  I NOW say that if anybody ever says that Omaha Steakes doesn't care about their product feedback, do NOT believe it.  After submitting my original review, I was contacted by Mr. Sendgraff of Omaha Steaks who apologized for their poor packaging and inormed me that Omaha Steaks has a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all their products and, that he was refunding my entire purchase price, including shipping.  Even after I told him we had eaten the cheesecake, and it was really quite good, he insisted that my experience had not met their 100% satisfaction guarantee standards and my refund would stand.  I say, THANK YOU, Mr. Sendgraff, you are a credit to Omaha Steaks Customer Service and have restored my confidence completely.  I'm looking forward to my next purchase of an Omaha Steaks product.

review/text: This is my first experience with antioxidant-rich white tea.  Also, I like the fair trade and organic labels.  Since I prefer mild teas, the subtle, honey-like sweetness and floral, fruity notes of white rose tea are immediately pleasing.  A stronger brew intensifies the rose flavor, but the tea remains smooth without bitter tannins often found in green and black teas.  The white tea and rose blend is exquisite - a wonderful, soothing treat by itself or with dessert.<br /><br />This has become my favorite tea!

review/summary: Romantic, Natural, Unique Tea Experience
review/text: *****<br />White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is an exciting and unusual premium Numi tea. It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: "Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair." I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: Despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here (see the ingredient list on the Omaha site), but.... that is not a bad thing in this case. They are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious. Our kids just love them. We serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal. 1 piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering:<br /><br />Calories: 120<br /><br />Fat: 4.5<br /><br />Trans Fat: 0<br /><br />Sodium: 270<br /><br />Carbohydrate: 17<br /><br />Protein: 3<br /><br />For our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under 5 fat & 25 carb. This fits perfectly & the taste is superb. Baked in the oven, they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. All with no grease. We now keep these on hand instead of french fries. I know they cost more, but they taste better and they are so much healthier. We wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time.

review/summary: Over Rated (way over priced)Frozen meats
review/text: For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!

review/text: I received 4 of these in my first ever Omaha Steaks order that I received today. I wasn't sure what to expect, but so far, I've been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients.

review/summary: These are the best hash browns!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I got these in the mail today, i know right, sounds so weird to say i got hash browns in the mail, haha.  Come in dry ice cooler and were in box all in their own lil plastic bags.  Just stick them on a baking sheet for 35 min. at 400 degrees.  when you get them out of the oven you smell the cheese and it has nice crunchy outside with creamy potato inside, if you want the best side dish to your steak or other meat, hey could even use for breakfast with some eggs and sausage, your choice, this get a 5/5 for taste, 5/5 for presentation, buy these now, great price too, thanks for your time, and thank you omaha steaks, the best at great prices.

review/summary: Au Gratin Potatoes
review/text: January 3, 2011<br /><br />I purchased these potatoes from Omaha Steaks online last week. I was not sure what to expect ... The au gratin potatoes I had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce, and by the looks of them, this certainly wasn't it ... I opened the box and got out my skillet. The first thing that I noticed is that these things were huge ... like a gigantic tater tot. I browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each. To my surprise, they were very tasty. Texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh .. not frozen or freezer burned. I liked them alot. I think these are perfect for kids ... none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture ... I give these 4 stars.

review/text: These mint patties are absolutely scrumptious! The chocolate coating is really good... the minty inside is a tad bit less "gooey" than a regular mint patty, but just as yummy. I eat 2 patties every night as a treat to myself.  The only problem I can see here is that the price is much too high.  I pay $1.99 a 3 oz pkg at the grocery store - that's $24 for 12 3 oz packages.  But, they really are good!

Not necessarily bad just different then regular chocolate.  The mint is delicious but as one reviewer pointed out they are harder than regular mint chocolates.  The problem is the price.  I pay 1.50 to 1.99 at the grocery store so these are completely out of line.  You can get them from Russell Stover website for 1.99 a bag!

review/summary: AWESOME ON THE GRILL - Need to order more now, or a recipe!
review/text: I was given Omaha Steaks Marinated Salmon Fillets #1417 4pcs/6oz as a gift.  I grilled these indirectly over high heat for just over 4 minutes per side exactly and was TOTALLY blown away by just how good they were.  I was not a Salmon fan at all and never ordered Salmon when dining out.  I now may have to alter that theory when we go out for fine dining to try to compare those events against this item.  Awesome on the grill!  Moist and very flavorful.  I would please ask someone to please invent or advise a copy-cat recipe that attempts to mimic this product since it could get pricey to buy these often otherwise!  BUT OH SO GOOD in my opinion!  Hope you agree.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient deck:<br />Atlantic Salmon, Marinade(Canola Oil, Olive Oil, water, salt, spices, dehydrated garlic, paprika, dehydrated onion, dehydrated red bell pepper, autolyzed yeast extract, natural grill flavor, natural smoke flavor, citric acid, and natural flavor), color added.<br /><br />I posted a picture showing the nutrition facts and recommended preparation methods too.<br /><br />Take care.

review/summary: Convenience and Quality
review/text: My son has always loved these. We feed him prunes any time he seems to be getting constipated and like magic, these resolve the issue. I have made my own baby-food food for other things, but the convenience and quality of these organic prunes have made them a staple at our house. The prunes always arrive in good shape, packed with lots of bubble wrap to prevent breakage. We use the subscribe and save option to save money, so we get a shipment once a month.  This is currently the only baby-food item we still purchase since my 20 month old has been on solids for a long time now. At this point, I am trying to find recipes that use pureed prunes once my son stops eating these.

review/summary: Good babyfood company
review/text: I like buying the 1st prunes for my grandchildren. They love the taste. It is sweet and tastes like prunes. It is a good bulking fruit. It gives bulk to their stool so the babies are not straining to go to the bathroom. Also if the baby is constipated it will help to soften the stool. Have had good reaction with my grandchildren when their stool started to slow. Fed them the 1st prunes and they softened up by the next day. This is a small jar and I feel it is a good amount to use for my grandchildren. I don't use this every day, just when needed. Amazon delivered them promptly, and packaged them very well.

review/text: I gave this product 4 stars because<br />1) it's organic<br />2) it passes the mother taste test-  It actually tastes like dried prunes<br />3) there isn't a whole lot of waste<br />4) it comes in a glass jar (yes there is BPA in the lid, but what can you do?)<br /><br />The reason I say buy 1 first is because it turned up that my baby has an allergy to prunes (birch pollen allergy including most pit fruits).  We didn't find this out until giving her prunes and she broke out in hives and had pretty bad vomitting episode for the next 3 hours.  So now I have 11 jars of prunes that I have to give to the closest Mother and Child shelter as opposed to being able to feed them to my child.

review/text: I wasn't expecting much of a microwavable rice, and this still really disappointed me.  I wanted something quick, since I frequently get home from work late and don't want to wait 20 minutes for rice to cook.  I figured it was worth a try since it was inexpensive, but it was just plain horrible.  The smell was not appetizing, the texture was hard and the rice clumped together.  I ended up taking one bite and throwing the rest away.  I ended up spending more than 20 minutes in the end since I had to make something else.  I definitely won't be buying this again, and recommend anyone looking at this product to go with a traditional Spanish rice from Near East, Rice-a-Roni, or Carolina.

review/text: We love this rice.  It is a very quick and tasty side dish.  Depending upon the package it may be a bit dry- that seems to be hit and miss.  If it's dry, I just dump it in a bowl, add a little water, zap it and let it sit for an extra minute or so to get it moist.  In spite of that, the flavor is just delicious to us.  We love it.<br /><br />Tip- Squish the package around as much as possible prior to microwaving as it gives the best 60 second results.
