review/summary: Handy for travel, backpacking and drinking carb, calorie and sugar free!
review/text: Mio works great if you want to sweeten water, especially as a substitute for soda.  For people who choose to eat low carb, such as the Atkins method, this provides a way to enjoy a sweet tasting drink without the carb or sugar penalty.  I wanted to avoid diet soda and anything sweetened by Aspartame too (as suggested in the Atkins book). MIO is just the ticket (it's sweetened by Splenda). This stuff is small, easy to use and tastes good to. It helps me to drink plenty of water and provides easy travel options. I also use it to flavor water when camping, hiking, at work and on weekend trips. The bottle is so small and light and sweetens 24 cups worth of water.<br /><br />When I first started using this, I would over flavor things. After just a few times it's easy to determine about how much to squeeze into the size of container you are using. The fluid is very concentrated so be careful not to splash or spray it on your clothes. 1 bottle lasts me several days and I drink it all day long. It dissolves instantly, just a little stir and your drink is ready. If you really crave the Soda fizz, you can add it to plain soda water too.<br /><br />Mango Peach is my favorite flavor.  I rank the flavors about like this:<br />1. Mango Peach<br />2. Fruit Punch<br />3. Strawberry Watermelon<br />4. Orange Tangerine<br />5. Berry Pomegranate<br /><br />The price varies wildly, check your local stores too. Give it a shot and you'll be happy you did.<br /><br />5 stars for a great product, providing a carb free option.

review/summary: Great Stuff for Water
review/text: I use MIO with my SodaStream dispenser.  It makes the best carbonated flavored water.  Much better than the flavors that you can buy that are made solely for the SodaStream (and a lot cheaper)?  If you are not big on drinking plain water, like me, then try this stuff!  My favorite is the Orange Tangerine, but I'm pretty fond of the Berry Pomegranate too.

review/summary: Great for traveling
review/text: Did you ever travel to another area and not like the taste of the water?  A squirt of MiO can be the solution.<br /><br />Mango and Peach are 2 of my favorite flavors and in my opinion MiO captures them nicely.<br /><br />My mother stopped drinking water because it tasted awful to her.  We all need to be hydrated - especially our SENIOR Seniors. (Especially the stubborn ones who insist on living alone!) Now, she doesn't have to make a heavy 2 quart mix.  MiO is convenient - ANY glass size that's comfortable to hold.  She can make it the strength she likes.<br /><br />Lot's of us don't enjoy the carbonation of soda.  MiO is perfect for us.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying other flavors.

review/summary: It works. Period. Arm & Hammer "Fridge-N-Freezer" saved my car's interior.
review/text: In one overnight application, this product saved my car's interior.<br /><br />Almost a year ago, my car lease ended and I bought a new car. The old car was a luxury sedan with full leather seats. The new car is a compact hatchback with cloth seats. (I can't afford luxury anymore.) Both cars had a carpeted trunk.<br /><br />Whether because of the difference in the cars' interior materials and/or because of a change in my use patterns, a few months ago the new car's interior developed an unpleasant, sharp chemical odor. I could not remember the old car ever having this problem. It got so bad that my girlfriend commented that the odor was affecting some of my outwear. Though I think that certain materials were more affected than others, the problem was undeniable.<br /><br />I looked for a livable solution: something inexpensive, Earth-friendly, and easy to use. Baking soda is the classic natural odor remover, so yesterday I checked the supermarket and found that "Fridge-N-Freezer" seemed to be my best bet. On sale at 99 cents a box, I gave it a try.<br /><br />Last evening, I activated two 16 oz. boxes of "Fridge-N-Freezer" (peeled off the perforated sections on their outer cardboard case, front and back, to reveal the inner spill-proof, breathable cloth panels.) Then I placed one box in my car's trunk and one in its cabin. I closed the car's windows, doors and trunk, then waited.<br /><br />This afternoon, I checked the car's interior. The air in there was sweet and clear. There was no trace of the chemical odor. Amazing.<br /><br />Anyone would have noticed the chemical odor in my car. But I am very sensitive to scents (I collect perfume; I like coffee, wine and distillates for their aromas; etc.), so the problem was making me nuts.<br /><br />At two dollars a month, and since it is so easy to use and is ecological, Arm & Hammer "Fridge-N-Freezer" is a perfect solution for me. I give it my highest recommendation.

review/summary: Buyer Beware
review/text: I ordered this item from this seller based on their good customer rating. With that being said, I recieved the order within a reasonable time. However, the items recieved were not as described. I got 12 boxes of regular baking soda, not fridge n freezer which is described. Worse yet, all 12 boxes were expired by 1 year. Stamped on the bottom was hh 2011. The order was in June 2012.<br /><br />To be fair, the seller appoligized & issued a refund without need of a return. As luck would have it, I found the item I wanted at just .89 cent a box at a local retailer! Just be aware of what can happen.

review/text: This is the tea I measure all other teas by, the "gold standard" if you will. Prepared properly, it makes _excellent_ iced tea. (Do_not_ boil_bags! This makes a _bitter_brew.) Hot, it's a wonderful alternative coffee, unless you're like me (I don't drink coffee) and it is my hot beverage of choice.<br /><br />It's great to have a hot cup of tea first thing in the morning (or any time).  I have tried other teas - flavored, herbal, Earl Grey, even sage tea. Nothing tastes as good to me as Lipton Tea.<br /><br />So if you're a tea lover, I'd suggest you try this full bodied tea.

review/summary: Quite Good for the Toddler.
review/text: We have a three-year-old toddler and feeding him properly is always a problem. He seems to love junk foods and we tend to restrict them. Take the matter of beverages, for example. He loves all kinds of soda pop. We supply 100% juice drinks instead. He doesn't seem to mind and the juices disappear in short order.<br /><br />One that proved to be quite successful was the Apple and Eve Fruitables Juice boxes. They come in large packets of 6.75 ounces boxes and the large container holds a variety of flavors. Grandma brought over about a half dozen boxes and I believe she probably got them at Costco. In any case, they are a mixture of fruit and vegetable juices. I like the mix because the little dear doesn't seem to particularly like vegetables and this is a way of getting him some of the nutrients. I also like the no added sugar. He loves these things and will seemingly drain one in an instant. We try to keep about a half-dozen boxes stored in the fridge and ready to go. I tried them and they are quite good. I'm going to have to pick up another large container.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Our yellow lab was very itchy this winter. She could barely do anything without stopping to scratch. She had a very red, angry patch just above the base of her tail. Our vet mentioned cortisone but suggested we try an oatmeal shampoo first. I found this at our local pet shop and the proprietor recommended it, so I tried a bottle. So glad I did! Our dog has no more itchy spells, her raw patch is all healed, the shampoo has a very light scent, and we use about half as much as we did of the cheap stuff we were using before. This will be our dog shampoo from now on. High quality product that does just what it says.

review/summary: I'd Give This Ten Stars if I Could!!!
review/text: What caught my attention to this shampoo was where one of the reviewers said that she could get by with using less of it when bathing her Yellow Lab. I was hesitant to buy it because of the price. I thought that it may just be cheap shampoo in a fancy bottle. It turns out I was wrong and she was exactly right. You really can use less soap.<br /><br />My dachshund has sensitive skin along with an allergy to fleas.  We use a Frontline type flea treatment but she still gets the occasional flea bite. The hot dry weather here was wonderful for producing a bumper crop of fleas. It also caused my poor little dog's skin to be extra dry. She was constantly scratching, even losing sleep because she'd wake up and have to scratch.<br /><br />We used the Tropiclean shampoo today. We followed the instructions to the letter making sure we left the soap on for 5 to 10 minutes. Our Doxie does not like being wet so like always she fought us and tried to escape. Then a funny thing happened. She quit fighting and raised her head up in her "Oh this feels so good." manner. She stood and let us wash her with no problem. Like the reviewer with the Yellow Lab said we used less soap than with other brands. My former brand was the Petco generic brand soap. As soon as i got it on my hands I could even feel the difference in quality. This soap had a thicker, richer, finer feel to it. It also had a good smell.<br /><br />The Tropiclean had an immediate effect on my dog. It was three hours ago that I washed her and she has not scratched yet. In fact after we were done she had a lot of energy. Watching her frolic was well worth the money I paid for this shampoo. One last thing... Before the bath I could scratch her back and she would raise her back paw involuntarily and scratch like dogs do when you scratch just right. After the bath she quit doing that. Try as I might I could not get her to do that.  That proved to me the shampoo did it's job very well.<br /><br />We have used oatmeal based shampoo before but the Tropiclean has a form of tea in it and apparently that boosts the effect of the oatmeal. Whatever is in it it is absolutely the best dog shampoo I have ever used. Just be sure and follow those instructions. I also found out that the company that sells this stuff is located not very far from where I live. The next time I am in that town I'll be stocking up.

review/text: I was a bit sceptical about this shampoo due to the name.  I was worried it would be too tropical scented.  The shampoo lathered nicely.  The scent is very mild.  Best of all, it relieved my dog's itchy skin.  I use no more than half as much of this shampoo as other, less expensive brands.  I am really sensitive to sulfates.  This one doesn't have any so it didn't bother my skin bathing three dogs twice a week.  I would definitely recommend this to others!

I wish there had been a bit more variety in the package, but oh well. I liked the orange the best, and I'm not a big orange soda drinker - it had a bit more bite, more of a "tangerine" flavor. The black raspberry was also good and pomegranate berry was the sweetest one. They're sugar free, zero carbs, have B vitamins and green tea extract in them, so they are sort of like an energy drink, but not so heavy on caffeine that you get jittery. Very nice ice cold on a hot day.

I agree, it's the best sparkling water I have found to date and it's fortified with vitamins and green tea and it's sweetened with Sucralose (not Aspartame).  An 18 pack was purchased for only $9.99.  Went back the next day and it was sold out.  It's been restocked and now I purchase a few cases each time I shop.  I've told many of my friends about this beverage and now they are all drinking it.  Yes all of them - Hoping San Diego Costco(s) keep Sparkling Ice in stock.  You cannot beat their price.

review/summary: EXCELLENT product, but this price is excessive
review/text: Cascade Sparkling Ice is fantastic!  It has zero calories and zero salt.  In fact, the only thing it has is a ton of flavor (people have "taste", food has "flavor").  I detect no after taste at all.<br /><br />However, you can buy this exact same variety pack at Cosco for about $11.00...and no shipping. Supermarkets in my area frequently have it on sale for .88 a bottle and, a couple of weeks ago, as low as .67 a bottle. That makes 18 = $12.67.

review/summary: Love the ICE
review/text: I was buying IZZE at BJ's, but they stopped selling it.  I found ICE at the grocery store and decided to find my replacement for IZZE....I loved it.  Light, refreshing, not sweet, no aftertaste and I like the Black Raspberry, Lemon-Lime,  Grapefruit, and Orange Mango.  Added bonus - no calories. I love the carbonation.  As with any carbonated drink, I take caution in opening; so far no problem.  They are a little pricey in the grocery store at .99 each, but BJ's have them for $9.99 a case which includes the variety above (except for Grapefruit).

review/summary: Very good healthy drink
review/text: A couple weeks ago I went over to my mom's house and she offered me one of these ICE drinks. I was surprised how good they were and instantly went on Amazon to look for them. I was able to get the box for $15 (now finding our local Costco sells them for $10) and have been periodically drinking them. All of the flavors are actually pretty good and typically I don't like drinks like lemon lime or any sort of apple just because it seems almost tart to me but this one was surprisingly good. I think it's because it doesn't have carbonation that it tastes quite good. Anyways, long story short, they are very good drinks and the fact that they have 0 calories and pretty much no harmful stuff in them means that I can drink a tasty drink without feeling bad.<br /><br />In fact, I am a HUGE dr. pepper fan and have been substituting that on a regular basis. Pretty good!

review/summary: Artificial sweetner in product
review/text: I bought this believing it was an all natural product.  When I took my first sip I thought it tasted artificial and after researching discovered that it contained sucralose. It is deceptive  not to include this information prominently on the packaging when claiming all natural flavoring. In fact I did not see it mentioned anywhere unless you read the ingredient list, where it is easy to confuse the 'sucralose' with 'sucrose' -a natural sugar.<br /><br />The advertising on the package claims to be unsweetened.  Not true, it is sweetened with an artificial sweetner.<br /><br />This is the product description on Amazon:  "We start with pure, natural water, add carbonation and 100% fruit essences to create 10 distinctly thirst-quenching flavors." Very misleading.

review/summary: A Great Grocery Product From Canada
review/text: YUP-these are made in Canada. The company web site says they're based in Preston, Washington in the foothills of the Cascade mountains. All of the ones I've purchased say Made in Canada. So be it.<br />I saw these in my local grocery store. Being naturally curious, I read the ingredients and was elated to find that they use sucrolose, otherwise known as SPLENDA, as their sweetener, not aspartame, which leaves a horrible aftertaste and NO SUGAR ADDED and no carbs or calories. I took a few home and really like these. They are a nice alternative to regular water and the other things I normally drink. They also add a little extra to the meal, being 17 ounces instead of the popular 12 or 16 ounce drinks.<br />Because they are no sugar, no calorie and nicely flavored, I recommend these to anyone who wants a little variety in what they drink without worrying about the sugar. Be sure and check the web-prices are all over the place. I reported to Amazon a cheaper price on another web site and they lowered the price within a few weeks. They also come in 12 and 18 packs AND in single- and variety-packs. My preference is the orange mango, black raspberry and kiwi strawberry. I have so far been unable to find the coconut pineapple, lemonade and lemon lime flavors but am still looking.

review/text: I purchased this on a whim based on a co-worker's comment about how much they like this brand.  It's not the best value at $1.25 each on subscribe & save but I was interested enough to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did!  All three flavors were great and each time I picked one up I was saying, "This is definitely my favorite flavor" but then I'd say the same on the next one and let's just call it a vicious circle!<br /><br />I did want to point out, and why I deducted 1 star, the picture of the product listed shows "Pomegranate Berry, Orange Mango and Black Raspberry".  However, the package that was received had Lemon Lime in place of Pomegranate Berry.  While it was a great flavor, I was looking forward to trying the Pomegranate Berry.  I'm hoping maybe my next shipment is what is shown on the picture.

review/text: I purchased the Orange Mango flavour on a Lightning Deal and liked it. So when I saw they had lots of different flavours, I wanted to try them. There aren't any places locally to buy it, so when I saw variety pack, I though that was a great way to try them all.<br /><br />When I opened the box, I was very disappointed. There are only three flavours in this pack: Orange Mango, Black Raspberry and Lemon Lime. I quickly put them in the fridge, because while they are OK at room temperature, they are better cold. So I tried them out. They all have a fresh taste, and it pretty good while you are drinking them. However, the taste last for hours after. This is actually not very pleasant, and made me feel reluctant drinking these. I cancelled my subscription, and will go back to buying water from my local stores, they are cheaper and taste better.

review/text: My wife introduced me to this drink.  My favorite are lime and black raspberry flavors.  We bought them at Sam's Club and enjoyed them a lot.  However after about a week consuming 2 per day I noticed that I had begun to feel very depressed and had suicidal thoughts.  I do not take any medication at all and I started to see what is it that I have been consuming lately outside of my routine.  The only thing different was the Sparkling Ice drink.  So, I did not share this with my wife but I stopped consuming it to see if these feeling would go away.  WOW. They stopped.  I have not had another since.  It has been 2 months and no depression here.  I feel great.  So, out of the blue I shared with the wife about my weird feelings.  To my surprise she told me that she has been feeling the same since she started to drink this beverage.  I feel weird about sharing, but I wanted to see if any other people felt the same.  My wife cannot quit them.  They are good indeed however for me did not work right.  I shared my story with a local distributor and he laughed at me.  Okay maybe I am crazy.

This drink, sparkles all over the place...uhhh. What i'm saying is that it is so carbonated that you have to make sure you open the same bottle with caution everytime you want to drink it, otherwise it will explode all over your clothes, books etc, which I experienced. I was so mad I thought I may like the taste but lm not going to be on the edge each time I want to open a bottle I have already been drinking from. Its like you cannot afford to be distracted if you want to drink Sparkling Ice that's for sure....

review/text: I try new hot sauces as often as possible and Melinda's has done it again with this particular sauce. It probably goes without saying that this is extremely hot, but what is impressive is that there is an equal amount of flavor. As other reviewers have pointed out, there is a significant difference between a sauce that is just simply chemically hot with extracts and concentrations of capsaicin and one that is naturally hot without the chemical bitter taste you get with some other sauces.<br /><br />Long story short, this sauce is packed with flavor and certainly packed with heat, it isn't the 'hottest in the world' but if the novelty of insane sauce heat has worn off and you're looking for a flavorful heat, this is for you.

What is amazing is that there are no "hot pepper extracts" in this. All natural ingredients. There are some flavors that remind me of the Habanero pepper, but this sauce is in another galaxy as far as heat is concerned. I will need to dilute it down or mix it in some BBQ sauce or something, it is that hot. Putting a dime sized drop on a sandwich was tasty at first then the heat comes, and keeps coming. My mouth and tounge hurt for many minutes afterwards, then came the endorphin rush and all was well. Bottom line, if your looking for an all natural hot sauce that is truely hot, look no further.

review/summary: One of the best hot sauces I've tried
review/text: As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of hot sauces, I would have to say that Melinda's Naga Jolokia is my absolute favorite.  While not as hot as some of the other sauces made form the Bhut Jolokia (Ghost Pepper), it definitely has the best flavor of the ones I've tried.  That said, it is still very hot and there have been times my digestive system has hated me for using too much.  As far as Melinda's sauces go, I would consider this one of the best ones, and as a fan of Melinda's, that's pretty good.  As for heat, I would consider Dave's Jolokia sauce a little hotter, but I'd choose this everytime, just because the flavor is better.  But then again, that's just my opinion. Get both and try for yourself...and get that whole milk ready.

If you are someone who appreciates flavor and heat, Melinda's Naga Jolokia is definitely worth trying.

review/text: THis sauce lives up to its name and the reputation of the Ghost Pepper.  It's more than merely hot, though, because it has flavor  and<br />when it's used judiciously, will not overpower the taste of the food.  It provides more than augmentation like, say, Tabasco, because the Ghost Pepper is<br />undeniably hot, and if you use it too liberally no doubt it will render your sauce, your sandwich, your potatoes more molten than you may like.<br />But a few drops, strategically placed and swirled around, will give you a short burst of intense heat and a lingering taste that, while hot, makes good food<br />even better.  Highly recommended for pepper devotees.

review/summary: Now I know why they call it the Ghost Chili
review/text: Like most Melinda's hot sauces, they aren't the hottest around. You CAN find hotter sauces made from the same pepper... but whether you taste the pepper is a different story. What I've noticed with this brand of sauce is that you can actually taste the pepper. Now to this particular sauce... I tried dabs of this sauce on omlets or pizza with no particular note or notice. It seemed no hotter than any other habanero based sauce I've had in the past. All hype.. right?<br /><br />One day I decided to use it for a dipping sauce for french fries... not such a good idea. This sauce is fine in small amounts, you get a good dose of the taste of the pepper. But try to use it like a habanero sauce is a mistake... it's painful. Slow, constant burn really sneaks up on you, just when you think it is not that bad... it's too late. Have respect for the Naga Jolokia!

review/text: I should of bought two bottles of Melinda's and saved on shipping because I have been putting this delicious sauce on everything.  Not as spicy as I thought it would be, but it taste great with a good burn.  It burns much more than any store bought sauce I have tasted.

review/summary: AMAZING
review/text: This hot sauce is GOOD!<br /><br />I am a chili head with over 30-40 different "active" hot sauces and much more used and in storage. This sauce is one of my favorites. The sauce really works off of the heat and flavor of the ghost pepper and does not try to mask it like many other naga jolokia sauces. It is very spicy though and would only recommend to serious chili heads who like a great heat and great flavor.

review/text: I sought this one out because I like Melinda's and I like that it contains peppers, not extracts.<br /><br />It's good - first jolokia sauce I've tried. I've had a few of Melinda's habanero sauces and like them very much - definitely my favorite brand. But I think Melinda's carrot, etc. blend matches much better with habanero than jolokia - they seemed to clash a little bit. Seems the jolokia overpowered the other flavors rather than blending.<br /><br />Definitely hot. Worth a try. Melinda's fans may be a bit disappointed.

review/text: A very good and very hot sauce...a few drops will do.  Not overly hot like the Dave's Insanity where all they use are extracts.  You actually get some flavor with this one.  It does take some getting used to if you are moving up from Habanero sauces...take it a drop at a time until you develop your toloerance. Once you do, you'll not go back!  I started with a couple drops, and now use this as my go-to sauce of choice on eggs, in chili, on my breakfast sandwich....it's just so good.

review/summary: Expected more
review/text: Ok...my husband had me purchase this sauce as he is a big pepper fanatic and could not wait to try the Naga Jolokia pepper. He was sorely disappointed in this sauce. We live in the Caribbean and are accustomed to really hot peppers, although I personally am not a pepper person.<br /><br />After the first tentative taste of this sauce my husband sighed in disappointment and proceeded to literally drench his food in it to get that "eye burning, choking" sensation that apparently all pepper fanatics can't wait to experience.<br /><br />I have not tried the sauce, but he says that in addition to the heat being just mild to moderate, there is not much flavour there. Anyway, heat level is a subjective and relative thing, so as far as my review goes...thumbs down on expected heat and flavour.<br /><br />I think his next step is to try the raw naga jolokia peppers. Good luck to him!<br /><br />I would just like to add to the above review and state that it is now 5 months later and I have since tried the naga jholokia sauce, as my spouse did not seem that impressed. I found it hot and spicy, but nothing that made my eyes water. The heat from the ghost peppers has been tempered with carrots, papaya and passion fruit. Still maintain the 3 star rating.

review/summary: Fresh Stack Honey Grahams
review/text: HoneyMaid's Fresh Stack Honey Grahams are the classic HoneyMaid graham cracker in new packaging. In the old box, the grahams came in sheets of nine crackers to a package. Each cracker a sheet consisting of two cracker squares. In the new box each package contains eight single squares. The squares are close to being the same size. However, when I placed one on top of the other, the new crackers were just a smidge smaller than the old.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, it is important to note that the new Honey Made Fresh Stack Honey Grahams contain two servings to a pack. One serving of four squares contains 130 calories, 3 grams of fat, 1 gram of fiber, 8 grams of sugar and a whopping 24 grams of carbs. The crackers contain 4% iron, 0% Vitamin A, 0% Vitamin C and 0% Calcium. Overall, the crackers lack in nutrition and should be viewed as more of a treat than a staple. If you eat the whole package you will need to double the calories, fat etc.<br /><br />The new packaging is certainly nice at keeping the crackers fresher. And one could argue it is better packaging, because though more material is used, fewer crackers are most likely being thrown out because they are stale.<br /><br />Overall the crackers are not all that nutritious so eating them along with a variety of other nutritious foods is important. For a more nutritious cracker, regular whole wheat Triscuits are satisfying and delicious. But for s'mores and homemade ice cream sandwiches, it is HoneyMaid Graham Crackers for sure.

review/summary: Why didn't they think of this sooner?
review/text: There's not much reason to review the actual graham crackers here. If you like graham crackers, then there's absolutely nothing to dislike here. This is the same classic, sweet, wholesome snack you've been enjoying from Honey Maid for years, just packaged in a way that's better for you (and the crackers). Every time that I've ever bought graham crackers in the past, the larger packs will end up being halfway eaten while the remaining crackers always (and I mean ALWAYS) end up stale. By changing the packaging and giving you six bundles instead of two, your crackers will stay fresh, crisp and tasty until you're ready for them. Throw in the added convenience of the smaller packs (much easier to throw in a bag, purse or lunch box) and this is truly one of those ideas that leaves you wondering why it hadn't been done years before. Honey Maid Fresh Stacks are now the only way to buy graham crackers.

review/text: I like graham crackers, so how can you not rate them 5 stars? And they ARE Honey Maid.<br />The only difference is this box has six packets, with 8 crackers to a packet. The only advantage I can see to this is taking them in your lunch or a picnic or something. I actually think 8 is a bit much for lunch. 4 or 6 and you could easily send them in your kid's lunch. So that is my one question to Honey Maid. What were they trying to accomplish?

What they've done here is to change the sleeve size inside the box so now instead of two large sleeves, the crackers are wrapped into several smaller ones so that you can worry less about the product becoming stale.  As long as the price is the same either way, I would vote for this product over the traditional.

review/text: This is one of those "What took them so long?" products.  The large/normal package of graham crackers is always too much - too often, crackers go stale because we can't finish them all.  So this new "half" packaging is much better.<br /><br />That said, they could STILL stand to shrink down the amount of crackers in each package.  It's too many for lunches.  Kids only eat about 2 crackers (which is one whole one) at a time.<br /><br />It's great for picnics and campfires (S'mores), though!

review/text: The Graham Crackers here are the same ones I've enjoyed as a treat for the better part of my life.  The difference here is that they're already "separated" into single squares.  They're also packaged into smaller groups.  You're getting the same number of crackers over all, but there are fewer of them grouped together in the wax paper bundles.  So if you just want one or two crackers, you don't get as many sitting in an open pack getting stale between snacks.

Packing these in a hard lunch box or being careful with your packed lunch is the way to go.

Each box has 6 packages and each package contains 6 single squares of cracker, half the size of the original Honey Maid cracker.

review/summary: Great idea - Smaller package stays fresh longer
review/text: This little change makes all the difference in ensuring that your graham crackers stay fresh longer.  There are 8-squares in each sealed package.  I often found that after opening a traditional package, all the crackers would not be eaten in one sitting and when the kids would go back for more a few days later, they would already begin to taste a bit stale.  Since each package can easily be a snack for 2-kids, I no longer have this problem.  The smaller package also seems to travel better with less crumbs getting scattered when I'm serving them.  Although I prefer the fresh stacks when traveling due to the smaller size, the packaging certainly isn't "crush proof."  Frankly, it's the same type of waxy wrapper that contains the rectangular graham crackers so you need to handle the package with care or many of your crackers will be crushed.  In other words, this package isn't something you'd throw in your kid's book bag for snack unless they like a lot of crumbs because they'd be pulverized to dust before they got to school.  Overall however, I really like the packaging idea and I'd definitely always buy the square stacks over the rectangular packaging providing there is no price difference.

review/summary: A Taste of Nostalgia And A Good Treat
review/text: It's been years since I've eaten Honey Maid graham crackers, and tasting these brought back all the nostalgia of my childhood! What kid doesn't love these?? And in convenient, on-the-go, pack 'em in your lunch sizes? It can ONLY be win-win, right? Well...maybe.<br /><br />This box consists of 6 individually wrapped packages of 8 crackers. By having them individually packaged, it does make for a much more convenient way to pack them into a lunch, or an on the go snack. And having them individually packaged also means the crackers stay fresh and crunchy. No more stale, soft crackers - although, I do remember that I enjoyed those as well as a kid. Go figure.<br /><br />For some reason, I had always assumed graham crackers were healthy. I guess that's because moms were always feeding us kids these crackers when I was a kid. When I read the ingredients now, as an adult, I'm not sure I would feed my kids these crackers on a regular basis - especially covered in butter, as we used to do when I was kid! However, as an occasional treat or snack, I really don't see any more harm with these than I do with the occasional cookie.<br /><br />What disappointed me the most (and the reason I subtracted one star), is the deceiving packaging, in my opinion. Most people will assume that one "fresh stack" is equal to one serving of graham crackers, and perhaps feel okay with putting one stack in a child's lunch. NOT SO!! Each "fresh stack" consists of TWO servings. So, the combined calories alone, equal 250. That's not including the fat, carbs, etc. I really do wish Nabisco had packaged these as single servings. For me, eating 4 crackers was enough (a single serving). Attempting to eat all 8 crackers would have been too much, but there is no way to re-seal the "fresh stack" packaging once it has been opened. It was really disappointing in a product I otherwise found totally satisfying.

review/summary: Great taste and texture from an old standard, but....
review/text: These are pretty much the same honey graham crackers from long ago, with that great grainy flavor with a hint of honey. They are in a smaller size. Fine, I never had much of a problem with the original size, but whatever makes us happy. I guess this size will help keep portions wrapped and fresh. I just wish Nabisco would dispense with one old custom: using partially hydrogenated oil(PHVO). Yes, if they do use it, it is a small enough quantity to meet the requirement of being listed as zero grams of trans fats, but it adds up. In this case, this product may or may not contain PHVO. So, it is obvious that PHVO is not absolutely necessary to produce this product, nor is it an economic necessity. So, we should ask ourselves, since we know it isn't good for us(that is why the amount present is listed on the nutritional panel)and is totally artificial, why does Nabisco have to deal with it? Don't they CARE?<br />Let's keep in mind that the CEO of Nabisco make lots and lots of dough(sorry for the pun), so maybe they should be replaced with someone who can manage to pay attention to producing the best possible product for the best possible price. I would be happy to take the job.

review/summary: Snack sized & fresh
review/text: I've always liked Honey Maid graham crackers--they' just delicious. These snack stacks make them easily portable in snack sized portions. This is especially valuable if you have kids, or if you don't eat graham crackers in large quantities. These are a win/win in my book.

review/summary: Perfection in a single size pack.
review/text: Love, love, love Honey Maid Grahams and this is the perfect thing for my household since I'm the only one who eats them.  The small packages are great and perfect for the one sitting without having the rest of the package get stale.  It will work lovely this summer when it's humid out.  Nothing worse than soft soggy grahams cause of the humidity.<br /><br />These are also perfect size for lunch boxes.  Great healthy snack for the kids and adults alike in perfect size pack that doesn't need to be stuck in a baggie getting all mushed up.  I don't know what else I can say to being lucky enough to live in an age where things are making life so much easier.  You gotta try these.

review/text: The little portion packs were great for smores at a campout and for putting into lunches without the need to open up the box and reseal it to keep the crackers fresh. I would definitly buy this again

review/summary: Good packaging
review/text: OK, these are graham crackers.  Same ones you've always had, they're fine.<br /><br />The good thing about these is that they are packaged as squares, not the larger two-square rectangle. What's the big deal?  They are easier to take a few to snack on.  No more breaking the big cracker in two and letting the rest of the package get stale.<br /><br />I just wonder why it took so long to package these correctly.<br /><br />If you're using a recipe -- use the old box.  If you are munching them straight, buy this package.

review/summary: Not Bad for a mass Produced Product
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEN3GK">Honey Maid Fresh Stacks, 12.2-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a><br />Honey Maid Fresh Stacks: Honey Grahams<br /><br />I have not had a Graham Cracker in years, maybe not even in decades. As a kid I liked to eat them in several ways; dunked in milk, or broken up and placed in a bowl with milk poured over them like a cereal, with fruit; strawberries, raspberries or grapes, but especially eaten right out of the box and spread with butter. My other graham delight was chocolate covered Graham Crackers.<br /><br />Given all of that nostalgia, I decided that of the various products offered me to review on the Vine Program, I would try the graham crackers. I had stopped eating packaged cookies years ago, except, now and then an all natural cookie product from one of the all natural bakeries or grocers. I made that decision because everything else seemed to have a multitude of questionable, unsavory or toxic sounding ingredients, and because one of my standards with baked goods is, I usually eat nothing that contains more than four or five ingredients.<br /><br />I was not happy about the Cotton Seed oil, let alone this partially Hydrogenated Cotton seed oil. However, 15 or 16 ingredients for a prepackaged, mass produced, eatable product and with only three questionable ingredients, is not bad at all. Usually, the ingredients on bakery goods number as many as 30-50 many of which sound more like solvents or gasoline derivatives than healthy food products. Normally, I avoid eating any product which has more than four to five ingredients.<br /><br />The Grahams also had fairly decent Nutrition support for a high volume manufactured product. There was no Cholesterol, minimum fats of all kinds, and 25-30 grams of dietary fiber, along with 300-375 grams of carbohydrates.<br /><br />The ingredients in the making of the Grahams were: Unbleached enriched Flour,  (Far better than bleached flour), a variety of vitamins, Graham Flour-Whole Grain wheat, sugar, (Far better than High Fructose Corn Syrup) Soybean or, and here is an ingredient I was unhappy about - Partially Hydrogenated Cotton seed oil). There was also honey, leavening (Baking soda and/or calcium Phosphate), salt, "artificial flavors"- (Another of my least favorite things to eat). Thus, there were only a few ingredients, which did not meet my standards<br /><br />I opened the box of Honey Maid Fresh Stacks: Honey Grahams and tried one right out of the box, and three with spread with butter, washed down with a glass of water (I no longer drink milk). The one without the butter tasted well but was a bit dry, hence the butter. In both cases, the crackers were as crunchy as I remembered them to be. I am a sucker for crunchiness in almost every product made with any sort of flour or potato product; pizza crusts, toast, French Fries, etc.<br /><br />The taste of the Grahams, was surprisingly good. They were crunchy, flavorful, and when spread with a thin layer of butter, you wanted to keep eating them.<br /><br />So, if the few ingredients I mentioned as downers does not alarm you and you like Grahams, I suppose you could give them a try, or you could buy an all natural graham cracker at an all natural bakery and compare taste and ingredients<br /><br />For a widely distributed, mass produced product, I give it a 3.5 out of 5, on the overall cookie Rating scale, and a 3.75 on the natural ingredients scale. As far as taste goes, I would give it 3.75 - 4 stars. Not bad for such a product.

review/summary: great idea!
review/text: What nice about these is that the crackers are in six nicely portioned packs so that the rest do not go stale so quickly. They of course tasted great as well but then I am not a graham cracker afficionado so my opinion in this case may not be the valuable here.

review/summary: Honey Maid Fresh Stacks
review/text: Well, the crackers are the same as you get in any package, but this is suppose to be a more convenient, "fresh"er way of using them. They are wrapped in brown plastic wrap and all the corners are broken, some of the crackers are in pieces. I think there are too many in a pack anyway, 8 crackers is too many to put in a lunch box for a 4 year old. I'd like to see a little sturdier wrapping so the crackers don't break up so easily in the box; and in the lunch box they become a total mess. I'd prefer to buy the regular box of crackers and put the amount I think is right into the divided plastic lunch container I use for his lunches.<br />I even think it's too many for us grownups to enjoy at one time and sort of forces you to eat all 8 crackers in the pack, by suggestion, or risk putting a couple back to get even more broken up.<br />As for the product itself, I love them.

review/summary: Pretty good snack
review/text: Tasty, not too bad on health, and great for a snack to throw in your bag. I particularly liked how the crackers came in little packs with small strips of 8. They were a great snack to munch on while I was at work and I didn't feel guilty about it. I would definitely recommend to others to try.<br /><br /> Filling, lightly sweet without being overly-sugared (I hate when foods are loaded with sugar since I'm into healthy eating), portable, and scrumptious.

review/summary: Deeeeelicious!
review/text: "Mmm, mmm, good" may be the copyrighted slogan for Campbell's soups, but it could also apply to Honey Maid's delicious crackers. They are a perfect snack with coffee or milk, and these Fresh Stacks are very convenient if, like me, you usually skip breakfast because the time you might spend eating is devoted to getting a few extra winks of sleep instead. These crackers are just the right size for those whose stomachs just can't tolerate a big breakfast, anyway. Of course, like almost any good food, Honey Maid Fresh Snacks are good at any time of the day or night.

review/summary: Wonderful packaging idea!
review/text: One of my pet peeves about buying graham crackers is how fast they spoil in those big wrapped packages. These "fresh stacks" packs take care of that. Still a little much to pack for a snack or in a lunchbox, they still are smaller amount. No need to break these in two, creating piles of crumbs.<br /><br />These packs contain smaller sized pieces, smaller stacks and a fresher product. Its totally worth the change.

review/summary: ON THE GO FAVORITE
review/text: I wasn't sure about this product. I figured it was a way to reduce the portions / increase the price. Well, actually, we like the smaller packets. No more open packets stuffed in ziplock baggies, stacking up in the cupboard. My husband actually went out and bought his own supply for his office.<br /><br />Same great taste; updated, convenient, on the go packets.<br /><br />As my 3-year-old grandson says: Good job!
