review/summary: The best KIND bars!
review/text: This is far and away my favorite of the KIND bars. They aren't sticky like some of them, and they don't just seem like another combination of almonds and fruit, like many of them seem to be. The peanut butter taste makes these really different from the others, and the drizzled dark chocolate is such a great addition. These are prone to becoming melty, though, so I keep them in my desk instead of a backpack or pocket. These are also hard to find in stores around me, so being able to get a box at a time is nice.

review/summary: The Best Gluten Free Bars!
review/text: I bought a box of the Mango Macadamia KIND bars from Amazon, since I had not seen that flavor at the stores.  They have a really delicious fresh fruity tropical sort of taste.  You can actually recognize what you are eating.  There are whole macadamia nuts in the bar.  They really do not taste like any other gluten-free bars that I have tried.  The KIND bars are so much better!  My absolute favorite is the Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew!  I buy several of those every time that I go to Kroger or Whole Foods.  I highly recommend these snack bars!

review/summary: Dark Choc is the dominant flavor; lots of crunch and chewiness
review/text: While the bar does contain a lot of peanuts, the peanuts are not the dominant flavor and neither are the cherries. Each ingredient is noticeable, but in the same way that one instrument is noticeable in an orchestra--they all play well together. What I like most about this bar is the dark chocolate and the texture. The bar is satisfyingly chewy with crunch from the peanuts and macadamia nuts, etc.  I was leery of this bar because I don't like chocolate covered cherries and thought it might have that flavor, but the cherry isn't overpowering and the bar isn't sickeningly sweet. It comes across like a somewhat healthy but flavor-rich treat for adults, not a bland granola bar or a kid's candy bar. Just ordered more on subscription.

review/summary: Delicious, but wait until fall...
review/text: These bars were delicious. The nuts were great, the honey flavor came through, and the dark chocolate was spot on. The only problem was the texture - I ordered these in the middle of summer & the chocolate had melted & wandered around in the wrapper. I hope to have better results ordering these in winter.

review/text: These bars are absolutely delicious.  I have steered clear of any of the so-called fiber bars, snack bars, etc., because honestly they all tasted like stale cereal to me.  These are completely different--no cereal similarities at all.  They are all nuts and fruit.  It's hard to stop at one!  Try them; you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Not as good as they used to be
review/text: Agree with previous reviewer -- these used to be fantastic, now just OK. Still my favorite energy bar, but as with others they have added cheap peanuts to most of the flavors. For those of us with peanut allergies, that's a real problem. I used to be able to eat most of the flavors, now there are just a few without peanuts. Last few months bars taste much more cardboardy than before -- they used to taste like fresh nuts & dried fruit.

I was looking for a bar that has a low sugar content, and this one fits the bill better than the others. I eat one of these bars each morning! They are packed with whole nuts, and are absolutely delicious. I chose to receive these through Amazon automatic delivery because it is less expensive than what I was paying per bar in the "Organic" section of my local supermarket.

Have tried a few of the other flavors, but they all had coconut, which I'm not a fan of.  This has a nice sweetness to it and therefore, some real flavor even though it's good for you.

review/summary: High Protein, Low Carb + Delicious
review/text: I was looking for a low carb bar that tasted good and had a higher protein content. This KIND bar was perfect with 10g protein/bar and only 15g of carbs and it tastes absolutely delicious! I like the fact that it has a lot of nuts (which their good fats) which helps it break down slower and more evenly so that you don't get hungry as quick and your body gets to absorb the nutrients more evenly. I bought the high protein KIND bard with the dark chocolate as well but this Almond Walnut Macadamia one tastes better. I highly recommend it!

review/text: My nearby Fresh and Easy Market has a display of Kind Plus bars and I find it difficult to pass without picking one up. I like the nutritional specs and the low sugar content of the bars. Plus they're quite good tasting. I often have one as desert with my evening meal, as is the case tonight. This one was Almond Cashew with Flax. It was good, but I didn't care for it as much as several others. The chocolate one is my favorite. In any case, this is a good bar with good nutrition.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Good for you, tasty, but gooey
review/text: I really like these KIND bars. They're tasty, they're light, and they're good for you.<br /><br />The bars I'm reviewing are Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio. They really don't taste like any of those, they taste like an almond bar with various bits of indistinguishable fruit bits. Here are the ingredients, with the titled ingredients in all caps: Almonds, blueberry pieces (BLUEBERRY, apple, and plum puree), raw sugar, glycerol, citrus fiber, cashews, honey, raisins, glucose, POMEGRANATE, crisp rice, chicory fiber, PISTACHIOS, soy lecithin, natural flavors. The ingredients are always listed in descending order of how much is included, and KIND pulled a fast one by calling their "blueberry pieces" a separate ingredient, since it's really just apple puree. By my math guesstimate, there is less than 5% of Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio in the whole bar.<br /><br />Basically, this tasted like an almond bar. My advice is to read the ingredients, and expect it to taste like what's in the ingredients, and not go by what the title is on these bars.<br /><br />They're also really gooey. These are probably the stickiest bars I've ever had. I never pick them up with my hands, but I eat them out of the plastic.<br /><br />Also, I've ordered about ten of these boxes off of Amazon, and one box was rock hard. Not this one, but another kind. So if your box is hard as a rock, then just order another one, and odds are it will be okay.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Good for you<br />+Lots of natural ingredients<br />+One bar is a good snack (not too sweet, not too small, just right)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The ingredients on the title of the bar misrepresent the actual ingredients<br />-Very gooey and sticky. You won't be able to touch them with your hands<br />-From my experience, 10% of the boxes have bars that are hard as rocks

review/text: I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.

review/text: I must admit I like them, and they are a healthy alternative to a candy bar.  But at about $1.50 each for a very small light bar, they're too expensive for most.  Honey, nuts, and a few pieces of dried fruit shouldn't cost that much.  A competitor may come along hopefully with a better value.

review/summary: Reminds me of Christmas time when I was a girl. . .
review/text: I couldn't believe my luck. This little nut bar was included in my variety pack of these yummy Kind bars that I had ordered from Amazon last month. The taste and texture of this nut bar is the exact same taste as the beloved "no bake fruit cake" that my Nana made us when I was a little girl back in the 50s and 60s. It must be the dates and the particular kind of nuts because it tickles my taste buds in just such a way as to send me back years ago. I thank you Kind bar makers as being genius in your combinations of ingredients. I love these things... Love, love, love. I have just recently made an order with Amazon for a box of 12 of these things... and just when I remembered a book I wanted and decided to add that to my order... gosh, well, I goofed up and I hope that Amazon figures it out for me just in time because if I get all 24 of these nut bars I am in real trouble. I will eat them till they're gone. So, please, cross my fingers Amazon does their usual magic and gets my order just right! I have been invited to "Like" them on my Facebook page, but then I don't go there often and... well, if I tell everyone, then they may become hard to find in the future... sorta like telling everyone where your favorite fishing hole is and then not being able to go there because it's so crowded.<br /><br />Computers are so picky!  I offered to write a review of a different flavor of this Kind bar and it told me that only one review per product per customer... but I could edit my review! So, here I am. Back again to further praise and describe what has become my favorite snack food. They are so filling though, you have to watch it because it becomes a meal substitute and then your friends think you're no fun cause you won't eat with them! You're already full! The protein in these bars make them ideal for trail food, however, if you don't have the teeth for nuts, stay away. This last bar I decided I'd praise is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNANSO">KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>. I found them in my local grocery store but they often run out and that's what sent me to Amazon for a check on their availability. Yum! Lucky me! So, I'm out. I ate all I ordered last month and I'm daydreaming of them right now. Should've ordered them a week ago so I wouldn't be out now. These dark chocolate bars are so delicious I can conjure up the taste and sensation right now because. . . now here's the heaven part of this daydream. . .they taste like Baby Ruth candy bars from when I would a youth!  Yum, yum, yum.<br /><br />Gotta love it, guilt free candy! But, wait, everyone, it is NOT guilt free if you make it an extra snack, but instead make it part of your meal planning day. The nutrition and calorie info is printed on each bar and if you buy them in the carton, then the info is even easier to read.

review/summary: Very Good!
review/text: I've had the other Nana's No Gluten Cookie Bars in Berry Vanilla, and they aren't that good. But, the Chocolate Munch flavor is good. They are more moist, have a good flavor and a little crunch. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the texture is a little bit crumbly. I will be buying these again.

review/summary: From a person with a very limited diet
review/text: I agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review.  I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick.  This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy.  Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants.  So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be.  Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies.  It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious.  If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are  a very welcome addition to that diet.

review/summary: Not a Gluten Free Product
review/text: I am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten-free diet for over six years, and was excited to learn about this product.  After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten. Nana's also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product.

review/summary: Good taste, but texture takes a little getting used to.
review/text: I actually tasted the Berry/Vanilla flavor.  If you've ever eaten a fig newton, then try to imagine a fig newton, minus the fig center, with rice crispies mixed up in it.  It tastes a little grainy at first, but once I read the ingredients and realized that the grains were puffed rice, I was more at ease.  Really a good taste.  One of the better gluten free/casien free/egg free cookies I've eaten.

review/text: Like other reviewers, I rarely eat cookies because I have an anaphylactic response to wheat/gluten. Therefore I generally 'love' any cookies I'm not allergic to. These are an exception. The taste is mild and fleeting. The texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth. The only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting, because they are simply inedible. Blah.

review/text: I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are "No Gluten" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again.

review/text: We have a gluten free household of 5.  No one in our family likes these.  My children (9, 7, &5) are begging me to throw the box away - I think they are afraid I'll sneak one in their lunchbox.  The cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth.  Have a glass of water nearby if you try these.  I hate to leave a bad review, but there are way better gluten free options out there.<br /><br />(I won't throw the box away.  I'll pass it on to another gluten free family I know and let them form their own opinion.)

I find it better to cut the plastic open with scissors to avoid breaking the cookies.<br /><br />If you want the cookies crumbled, just break them up in the packaging and then cut open with scissors to dispense neatly.<br /><br />I like to cut up strawberries and crumble a Nana's cookie over them.  With a little whipped cream, it's just like a good strawberry shortcake.  They are great crumbled over bananas, too.<br /><br />Despite being somewhat fragile.  Nana's cookies from Amazon usually arrive intact.

review/summary: Nana Banana - a delicious gluten-free treat for kids or adults!
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the "glue" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar.<br /><br />At only 130 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, and 7 grams of sugar (natural fruit sugar), the Nana Banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults.  The amount of banana is just right, and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside.<br /><br />Each cookie measures approximately 3.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide...perfect for a light snack or dessert, especially for kids.  Amazon has the best price around on Nana's Cookie Bars, so rest assured that you are getting a good deal, even though they are pricier than "regular" cookies made with corn syrup and sugar.<br /><br />Good cookies aren't cheap, and cheap cookies aren't good!  Give Nana's banana cookies a try.  (No, I don't work for Nana's but am a happy, loyal customer!)

He calls them "chocolate treat," if that gives you any indication of how good he thinks they are. I would definitely recommend this flavor to everyone.

review/text: It is close to impossible to find a cookie that is both soy free, wheat free, and the only sugar that is used is from natural juices: apple, etc. That is the only reason I gave the cookie such a high ranking...<br />As for taste, the chocolate flavor is pronounced, I enjoy the "crunch", however, the texture of the cookie has a lot to be desired. The cookie needs to either be crunchier or more moist. As is it wants to stick to the roof of your mouth, and is just odd. Making it unappealing. If I had tasted the item prior to ordering, I wouldn't have bought a whole box full.

I don't have any gluten issues so I can't speak for that, but I really enjoyed the real banana taste of these cookies. Some people complained about the drier texture, which I will admit is a little different than an actual cookie, but it I always have it with something to drink anyway so the drier texture is not a problem for me. The cookies are nice and soft and there are little delicious crunchy bits in the mix. I bring them to work for a nice afternoon snack :) I will definitely be buying them again soon!

Well low and behold (with the help of my husband and 6 year old daughter) they are gone quickly and we are ordering more.  If you are adding more whole wheat to your diet, these work.  If you are looking to get rid of refined sugar in your diet, these work.  If you order them and don't like them: you must have been one of those really picky kids that grew up to be a picky adult!  They are fabulous!  To eat them is to love them.

review/summary: My son loves these cookie bars!
review/text: My 8 year old son has numerous allergies plus autism and these cookie bars are a life saver!  They're made with fruit juice as opposed to cane sugar, so I don't feel bad about giving them to him.  We've tried many gluten free cookies, these are by far his favorites!  Unfortunately the local stores don't keep them well stocked, so I'm glad I found them here.  If you're not used to gluten free products, you probably won't like them.  The texture is very different than wheat, but if you haven't had wheat in quite a while, these are very tasty and not as crumbly as other gluten free products.  They are fabulous cookies and I'm so glad Nana's makes them...don't ever stop!

review/summary: Cookies you don't have to feel guilty about eating!
review/text: I was excited to find Nana's line of gluten-free cookies, and have tried all the varieties that they offer. Of the various flavors and styles of cookies, these are my favorite. I find their individually packaged cookies (the large, round ones) to be way too heavy for one meal and end up splitting them for two snacks. These 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse. I can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste, and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals. I happen to like the berry crystals, and it's nice to eat a cookie that you don't have to feel dietary guilt over! A great "hearty" cookie that goes well with coffee or tea.  Also, I am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever. In my opinion, a good product. However, because it is natural and doesn't have preservatives, the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging, the better. I have noticed that Nana's cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around, even sealed. Probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it, because I have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the Nana cookies.

review/text: I love Nana's GF lemon cookies, so I figured I'd try these berry vanilla bars too.  They're a nice, soft texture but I am not crazy about the taste.  I feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries, just little dried crunchies sporadically in the cookie.  I think I will try the chocolate bars next time around.

review/text: I know what you're probably thinking: They're vegan, they're gluten-free...they're a dream come true! The taste of these bars is very banana-y<br />but I doubt you'll be able to ignor the texture long enough to enjoy that. The texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt (I'm no dirt-eating pro...but when I was trying to chew that's all I kept thinking). Please...if you're thinking about trying these...go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first...while you're at it you may want to get some of your favorite soymilk...and lots of it!<br /><br />PS<br />If you're in the market for a yummy vegan bar...try the Betty Lous brand...The strawberry is super good!

review/summary: My kids LOVE them
review/text: When I found out two of my children were allergic to dairy and eggs, it was quite an adjustment.  Fortunately, we found Nana's Fudgy Wudgy Bars fairly soon after their diagnoses.  The kids think they are delicious, and I love them as a parent because they are a bit healthier than most "treats".  They are also conveniently packaged so that if we go to a birthday party, the kids can just grab a bar, and take it with them so they aren't left out when cake is served.  I give a package to their teachers too at the beginning of the year so that if there are any special occassions celebrated at school, my kids still get their treat.  The fact that my kids consider them a special treat, they must really be yummy, although I have yet to try them myself.  BTW, we tried a few other flavors of Nana's bars and cookies, but this one is the only one my kids like (or should I say love).

review/summary: NOT GLUTEN FREE!
review/text: After eating this product, I had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet. Those of you with a gluten intolerance and Celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean... somehow this product is contaminated with gluten! It is NOT gluten free! Please spare yourself the pain and suffering. These cookies are not worth it.<br /><br />For those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free, please keep these facts in mind:<br />1. If you eat gluten, it damages your intestinal lining.<br />2. If you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms.<br />3. If you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption, increase your risk for intestinal cancer, and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility, autoimmune disorders, oteoporosis.<br />In other words, cheating on your diet is not worth it!<br />Don't eat Nana's products!<br /><br />Instead, I suggest you buy something like Pamela's chunky chocolate cookies. They are one of my favorites.

review/summary: Fabulous osmanthus tea
review/text: This is a very low-oxidation or green oolong. The tea is full of tightly coiled leaves and tiny yellow osmanthus flowers. The addition of osmanthus makes for an exotic but easy to like crowd pleaser of a tea. It has a bright, slightly floral, slightly apricot-fruity citrusy flavor. The flavor is very balanced, the osmanthus flavoring is beautiful but the green oolong tea flavor still has room to shine through. It has a natural sweetness and is not vegetal or grassy like a lot of standard green tea. Easily good for two infusions. One of my favorites!

The previous reviewer said there were tiny osmanthus flowers in the tea. I received osmanthus scented tea, which is what I prefer. There are no flowers, but the flower taste is very much present. It's also more cost effective to receive 8 oz/per bag of tea leaves without flowers taking up weight. The bags are lined with a plastic film in case you accidentally lay it on a wet counter. Just let it dry before storing. One tablespoon steeps four cups in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NG0WUG">Bodum Bean 34 Ounce Tea Press in Purple</a>.

I was first introduced to this tea when traveling in China a few years ago but have been unable to find it here in the US until recently.  Try it, and I think you'll like it.

review/summary: Beware - Kellogg's has reformulated this
review/text: At the suggestion of my doctor, I have been eating Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus cereal for breakfast every day for several years now. A few days ago I opened a new box and discovered they have made changes in this product.  What a shock. I absolutely hate the new product.  I do not like the taste, I do not like the color, I do not like the slimy texture in milk. I loved the old Special K Protein Plus. I liked the taste.  I Liked the color.  I liked the texture.  I looked forward to it every day.  It was a great way to begin my day.  Now I am in misery.  It's as if my best friend is no longer here.<br /><br />And I looked at the nutrition information and see that they have reduced the fiber from 5 grams to 3 grams per serving, a reduction of 40 percent.  And they increased the sugar from 2 grams to 7 grams per serving, an increase in dangerous empty calories by 250%. I do not need more sugar in my life.<br /><br />And the front of the box states "satisfies hunger longer--see side panel for details. I looked at the side panel and it says "Special K Protein products are designed to promote a reduced feeling of hunger by increasing daily intake of protein and fiber".  So they added this statement to the new box while at the same time they reduced fiber by 40%.  And they also reduced the amount of protein in the box by about 10% because they changed the serving size.  The old box had 13.2 servings and the new box only 11.96 servings.  Fool me once.  Shame on you. Fool me twice.  Shame on me.  I will not be eating Kellogg's products anymore.

review/text: I didn't expect this cereal to taste very good, so I wasn't surprised when it didn't. If you want that extra kick of protein, I suggest mixing it half and half with a better tasting cereal. The protein did leave me feeling more full throughout the morning, but I took no pleasure in eating it. To make matters worse, the flakes are very thick and large, which makes them even harder to swallow. If you're going to make a bad tasting flake cereal, please have the courtesy to make the flakes smaller so they don't scrape my throat while I'm gagging on them. For some people, the ends justify the means. If you are one of these people, go ahead and buy it. I like a little more flavor in the morning, so I don't think I'll be buying it again.

My nine year old daughter even likes the plain flakes. Yes, I eat more healthy food than average people so I enjoy non-sugared cereals. I LOVE the nutitional makeup of Special K protein plus! LOW CALORIES, HIGH PROTEIN, MED/HIGH FIBER!! My mom doesn't like the taste, but it grows on you if you let it.

review/summary: WAS - Best Low Carb Cereal - Hands Down
review/text: I have a feeling that the bad reviews out here are from people who are impossible to please. No, this is not the greatest tasting cereal ever but it blows away anything else on the market claiming to be low carb. A low carb cereal is sort of an oxymoron anyway. After 30 long years, I finally found the key to losing weight and it was a low carb lifestyle. Do yourself a favor and do a little research on carbs and how they affect your body...it's rather alarming and why doctors and dietitians don't make you aware of this is even more alarming. I have eaten this cereal everyday for the last 3 years and I look forward to it every morning. If your store does not carry this item, just ask. It's a Kellogg's product and they can get it.<br /><br />Update: 9-24-2012<br /><br />Well, they went and screwed things up. The 'New and Improved' version has been ruined by them adding tons of sugar. It's almost sickeningly sweet now. I will quit buying it and try and find something else which won't be easy. Very, very disappointed. Changing a 5 star review to 1.

review/summary: I've been waiting for this for a long time!
review/text: Since I'm constantly trying to get enough protein (it's recommended one has at least one gram of protein per pound of body weight), finding a good breakfast cereal has been an issue for quite some time.  If I'm limiting my caloric intake, making certain that such a large proportion of that intake is from protein is very difficult.<br /><br />So many cereals deemed "healthy" aren't as healthy as they would have you believe.  My husband, for instance, bought some Smart Start cereals, but if you look at that label, it's clear that the cereals just aren't that good for you.  That one has over 200 calories per serving, almost 20g of sugar per serving, and only 5g of fiber.  Of course it tastes good. So does Frosted Flakes!<br /><br />Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus, on the other hand, is actually GOOD for you.  Don't be fooled by the plain Special K cereals-- they are missing the protein they need to make those cereals balanced meals.  This cereal, though, has it all. INCLUDING TASTE!<br /><br />Only 100 calories per serving, 5g fiber (proportionately better than the aforementioned cereal), ONLY 2g sugar, and-- here's the kicker-- 10g of protein!  And, that's what I'm always looking for in the foods I choose-- at least a gram of protein per 10 calories.<br /><br />And, what is really surprising is that this cereal is delicious.  I like cereal with flavor, and this has it. The texture is crispy, but nicely soggy in my skim milk, and there's a hint of nuttiness to it.  Additionally, it's sweetened slightly.  Sometimes, though, I sprinkle a packet of Equal on it if I am really craving something sweet.  Either way, it's very very good!<br /><br />Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus is perfect for breakfast and it's perfect for an evening snack.  It's great any time of the day.  Finding a low cal, low sugar, high protein cereal that is moderately low in carbs was impossible before this came on the market.  I can't praise this highly enough!

review/text: If you can find Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus that looks like this package, buy it! It's the perfect answer: low carbs, high protein and very filling.<br /><br />But avoid the new "tastes better" package. Kellogg's ruined a terrific product by making it "better tasting" and in doing so doubled the carb content and tripled the sodium. I used to be able to satisfy my doctor-imposed 60-carb-per-meal quota with a cup and half of cereal, cup of milk and half cup of fruit. With the "better tasting" version I have to cut back to a cup of cereal, half cup of milk and quarter cup of fruit. As a result I'm hungry before lunch and wind up snacking -- which does nothing for my health. Thank you, Kellogg's!

I tried giving it to hubby, without telling him I hated it, just to see if I could get rid of the box, but he won't eat it either.

review/summary: Great cereal
review/text: This cereal offers more protein which helps compensate for the carbohydrates for those who are sensitive to sugars. The cereal has a surprisingly sweet flavor, instead of the chalky or cardboard flavor you would expect from anything that has the name 'protein' branded on it. Absolutely amazing, too bad they dont sell it locally.

review/summary: The only cereal with enough protein for the Zone
review/text: I love cereal and couldn't have it on the Zone diet. This was a great find because I also like the taste--no protein powder yuckiness. None of the grocery stores carry it where I am, so I was happy to find it--at a better price!--here.

review/summary: I love this! I have also been waiting for this one!
review/text: This is an awesome cereal! It is very high in protein and low in carbs. Not to mention the 5 grams of fiber per serving and all for 100 calories! I was really surprised at how tasty this cereal is. Very crunchy and a great taste and texture overall. Makes a great breakfast or a great snack!

review/summary: Excellent for low carbbing
review/text: I'd have to agree with the others.  When I first bought it my expectations were low because other brands of low carb cereal (like Hi-Lo) were bland and did taste like cardboard.  I've been using it for about 4 months and have not yet gotten tired of it.  I liked it so much I tried out Amazon's subscription for a delivery every two months.

review/summary: A Great Disappointment
review/text: Unfortunately, this cereal is almost tasteless and what's even worse is that it gets soggy far too quickly. Now I'm stuck with over 3 and 1/2 boxes of cereal that I just have no desire to eat. Yuck! Big waste of money.

review/text: This is the best low-carb cold cereal on the market.  Most of them taste like the cardboard box, but this one is actually crunchy and flavorful.
