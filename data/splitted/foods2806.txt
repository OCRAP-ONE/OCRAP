review/summary: Might be working?
review/text: I am an anxiety ridden person who just needs to calm down, so I tried this.  I think it has helped a little with restful sleep.  It also impacts bowel movements, so watch your dosage.  Read the directions: it needs to fizz in warm water before you drink it.  There's a raspberry-lemon flavor I would probably have liked better but didn't see it until after I ordered.  The flavor is bitter but it's such a small drink (2-3 oz) that it's acceptable.<br />I think valerian root works better for immediate relief.  This needs a longer time period to work well.

review/summary: Great Magnesium suppliment, sweet dream lie ahead!
review/text: Was turned on to this product at a local store. This company makes excellent products, and this keeps the quality going. I feel more refreshed and feel like there are some recovery benefits as well. Tastes like bitter lemonade, but it is passing. As always do not take magnesium with calcium as is negates its effects.

review/summary: Don't want to live without this
review/text: My daughter (who worked at a natural foods store as the supplements specialist) recommended this to me to help with muscle spasms, and it's really been of great benefit. After going through two 8oz packages, I was unable to afford it for a while. I really felt a difference without taking my Calm Plus Calcium twice a day. I found it much harder to relax and sleep at night, and started having spasms in my leg and back again. Recently purchased this 16 oz container thru Amazon, and have been taking it regularly again, and finally the spasms are mostly gone again. I hope they never stop making this product - I suppose I could live without it, but I would rather not!

review/summary: one of my favorite supplements
review/text: Magnesium deficiency can affect all aspects of health. I have tried various magnesium supplements, and this is my favorite. I feel, as the label says in bold letters, more CALM when I take this. There is less muscle tension in my body. I enjoy the taste as well, mixed with just 3-4 ounces of hot water, for a soothing warm lemon drink. I often take this with my calcium hydroxyapatite supplements, since both will work better together.<br /><br />Down sides: Need to be careful when making it, or it will fizz itself up and out of your cup. Also, if you get loose stools, adjust your dose down because it means you are taking more than you can absorb. Unfortunately, this is also a sign that your body isn't ABLE to absorb magnesium properly, in which case you may need to look into temporary IV or topical formulas until this is addressed.

review/summary: Great for sore muscles, helps with sleep, helps with menstrual cramps.
review/text: I've been using Natural Vitality Calm magnesium powder for years. It helps me get to sleep at night, especially after a stressful day or when I'm worried. I use it after I work out at the gym; or if I've got sore muscles from other activities such as gardening or heavy lifting. It is great for "that time of the month." It helps with cramps and mood swings. Calm comes in a few different flavors such as lemon, raspberry-lemon, and orange. I like the orange flavor the best. It's easy to use. Just mix a teaspoon or more of the powder with hot water. Then add a little cold water or cold juice and drink.  A hint: If you have trouble sleeping, try taking Calm and also take Vitamin B1 about a half hour before bed, to help with sleep. My chiropractor recommended that and it works for me. The magnesium in Calm has been formulated to absorb into the body and take effect quickly. There is a little booklet that is usually attached to the canister of Calm that gives more info on all of the benefits of magnesium in this form.

review/summary: Love it! - helps my stress and anxiety, sleep, and blood pressure
review/text: I'm so glad my doctor told me about this stuff.  I was having high blood pressure, anxiety attacks, just stressed out.  Also losing my hair but I haven't been taking it long enough to tell if that will help with this problem.  But, I'm not on blood pressure meds anymore, and I just feel calm, just as it is called.  Work has, and still is, very stressful, but this stuff helps me get through the day without the need to go home and have a glass of wine, or something stronger, every day.  It does not make me sleepy (I was afraid of that happening at work), but it does help me sleep better through the night.  I'm now hoping that this, in addition to some other things I'm taking, will help with my hair loss.

review/summary: The best for bran muffins
review/text: Bran muffins have been a breakfast mainstay at my house for years now, and Kretschmers is by far the best brand of bran to use for bran muffins.<br /><br />Sure, you could buy bulk bran at a health-food store, but there's too much moisture in bulk bran.  Your muffins will end up chewy and gluey.  There's no substitute for Kretschmers toasted wheat bran to make your muffins light, crumbly, and slightly crunchy.<br /><br />The problem is that many local stores simply don't stock it, so it can be very hard to find.  Our thanks to Amazon for making this product available, and at a reasonable price, too.

review/text: I have used this product for many years. When I went to my local Harris Teeter, was told that the company went out of business and I couldn't get anymore. Duh...go to Amazon.com when someone tells you that..they have everything.<br /><br />So I called Quaker Oats who was the vendor in charge of selling this to grocers. They gave me the website of suncountryfoodinc.com<br />I contacted them, they for sure do still make it..the lazy vendor at Harris Teeter told them that the product has been discontinued.<br /><br />So I just ordered from Amazon, where it was cheaper by almost a dollar a jar and paid no postage. It came within a very few days.<br /><br />The product is excellent and healthy. I put it in everything, even shakes and cottage cheese so that I will get my fiber, bran in each day.<br />I think it deserves an excellent rating!

I also try to search out candy made in the USA, as I find candy from Mexico and Canada to have a strange, off taste to the sugar.<br /><br />The Claey's Cinnamon Drops are perfect! Not too large, not too sweet, and a true cinnamon flavor. The one pound bag is actually not that large. I plan to buy another bag of a different flavor, plus will buy my husband a bag of lemon flavor as a gift.

review/summary: Mild, not wild, about GMC French Vanilla
review/text: Green Mountain Coffee's French Vanilla has a nice taste, one that is not synthetic and the vanilla tones are subtle.  I would prefer a slightly more robust coffee roast and/or a stronger sense of the vanilla.  It is a good medium blend and certainly shouldn't offend.

In some coffee's that say they have flavor you can barely taste anything other than the strong coffee flavor. With this coffee you definitely get the vanilla flavor. It's perfect for me. Now I can barely start my day without having some Green Mountain French Vanilla.<br /><br />I've tried a few different brands and a few different flavors but I always come back to this one. It's delicious. Not too sweet, not too strong but still super flavorful and doesn't remind of me coffee. Which is perfect for me. So if you like French Vanilla you'll really love this coffee.<br /><br />Great price and fast shipping!

review/summary: Green Mountain Coffee French "Chemical" Flavor
review/text: Having tried other instant Coffee/K-cups I'd have to say so far this is the worst attempt at French Vanilla that I have encountered. From the other reviews you either like it or dislike it and those that dislike it all have one thing in common, the "Overwhelmingly" artificial chemical taste. It's more like 90% Chemical, 10% Vanilla flavor and it does not taste better after a few weeks of drinking it.<br /><br />While not a k-cup, one of the better instant Vanilla brews is Nescafe's Taster Choice Vanilla packets. You'll need 2 packets of the tasters choice for the best taste, but it's a lot better tasting than this Green mountain k-cup.

review/text: We have purchased Emiril's Vanilla Bam coffee for years. I'm not a big Emiril fan, but the vanilla coffee was excellent. Now I find that it's been discontinuted, so we had to find a replacement. Thus we tried Green Mountain French Vanilla. It has an almost overwhelming, fake vanilla smell and a bit overpowering taste. We will continue to try other brands until we can find something close to our favorite.

review/summary: This is by far my favorite chocolate.
review/text: Cadbury's is by far my favorite brand of chocolate. I've tried all different types of chocolate from organic stuff, to imported stuff, to exotic stuff, to domestic brands to the very expensive stuff so it's funny that it's the proletariat everyman's Cadburys, which is in my humble opinion the best tasting.<br /><br />In their fruit and nut bar you get hard and soft. The nuts are crunchy and the fruit (raisins) is soft. Together you not only get gustatory pleasure but you get a textural pleasure from the mixture of something crunchy as well as something soft in your mouth. I have to admit that Cadbury's, which is tailored to the American sweet tooth is a mite too sweet and it isn't dark chocolate, which is "good" for your health. But who wants to live forever anyway? Chocolate is for pleasure, it's a hedonistic pleasure, if you're into health you should be eating sprouts and doing yoga, not eating this.<br /><br />But taste is in the end subjective, all I can do is to ask you to try it. For me, it is the best.

review/summary: Excellent Balsamic Vinegar at an amazingly low price.
review/text: To be honest, for the price, this is very good Balsamic Vinegar.  I know that the price is rather low for quality vinegar and I was a bit leery of that aspect being a firm believer in that you get what you pay for.  In this case that old saying just did not apply.  As inexpensive as this is, the quality is actually quite high.<br /><br />I use quite a lot of this stuff in my cooking and a very large number of my salad dressings have this as an ingredient.  It would take an extremely sophisticated taste to tell this product from the more expensive vinegars and for everyday cooking I find that this Manicardi #12 more than fits the bill. Frankly, I was rather amazed at what I got for my money here.<br /><br />Like all Balsamic Vinegars, it takes a bit of experience to know where the cut off point is and where too much is too much...this product is no exception to that rule.  A light hand at first is the best policy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this.  You get the taste  you want, the essence, without having to sell off an expensive piece of jewelry each time you cook or whip a salad into being.

I knew by the price that it wasn't actually aged, otherwise it would have cost four times more. Unfortunately, there was no similarity between a good quality Balsamic Vinegar and this product. I even had a blind taste test to prove it.<br /><br />There is a chain of stores called Oliviers & Co. that sells a $35 bottle of Balsamic Vinegar that is ten times better than this product. I would also recommend Colavita's vinegar over this brand for 1/3 the price.<br /><br />Finally, it is customary for fine vinegars to have the number of years aged on the label or in the name. For these guys to call the Balsamic #12 is rude and misleading. For that reason alone I would add caution to your purchase..

review/summary: It's not the quality you might expect
review/text: I enjoyed my Manicardi #8 vinegar I bought in Italy. I thought I was buying and even better quality with this product as it is advertised as #12. I was able compare them side by side and this #12 is not close to the same good flavor. I did some research and found that it is actually a lower quality cleverly described by the manufacturer as a 3 barrel formally #12 to confuse the buyer. The description is correct per the manufacturer's label so I can't say that olio2go has a deceptive advertisement. It points out that it is actually "grape must" and a condiment quality. But including the #12 designation does mislead. So I gave it one star based on the easily confused product. It was not what I was expecting so I am unhappy with the result. Others may enjoy the flavor but the real thing is much better.

review/summary: Hershey's Unsweetened Cocoa 23-oz.
review/text: Have been using Saco unsweetened cocoa for several years but when the price even via Amazon skyrocketed I ordered Hershey's, which was less expensive. This Hershey's has a slightly more sharp and somewhat more bitter taste than Saco. I have rated Hershey's at four stars because of that taste comparison, since I prefer Saco - purely a personal preference evaluation.<br /><br />The order was shipped very promptly by the seller Mollie Mall and arrived quickly.

review/summary: Jaffa Cakes (cookies)
review/text: My husband heard of these and really wanted to try them. I thought they were a bit pricey for a small box of cookies (7.99) but we don't have them in my area so I thought we would try them.  They did arrive in record time. I can't complain about the shipping however they tasted stale and when I looked on the side of the package it said best if sold by 7/11/12. Today is 10/23/12.  It will be too much aggravation to send the unused portion back so I am not going to bother, but we are rather disappointed.

review/summary: Not the same
review/text: I had been using Cambell's Select Harvest as a low calorie supper as part of a weight loss program.  The can had only about 100 calories for the complete can and, yes, it was light, but filling.  I loss weight steadily using this.  The last order for this however, I received Campbell's Southwestern Style Vegetable Soup ( no "Select Harvest" in the title), and it had 20 more calories in the can.  I didn't like it.  I wanted as few calories as possible.  Perhaps it tasted different because I saw the additional calories; maybe it was psychological.  I gave the remaining cans away and will not order again.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029TEH72">Campbell's Select Harvest Light Southwestern-Style Vegetable Soup, 18.6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>

review/text: great soup, veggie base without the crap. about 40% sodium when i eat the whole can but since i dont use sodium much in my other cooking its great. what is also nice is if you cook fresh chicken or get a cooked one from the store, the fresh chicken just tastes that much better. i like to add red pepper flakes, garlic powder and turmeric.

review/summary: good brand, disappointing product
review/text: Upon serving myself a hot bowlful, the striking feature was the wonderful aroma of hot tortillas. How did they put that into a soup? But, once I bit into it, the soup was rather bland. Overall, I'm disappointed. My kids dislike it too.<br /><br />Fortunately, Campbell's has better varieties, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014EQHZ8">Chunky Beef Barley</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014ET1TW">Select Harvest Minestrone</a>.

review/summary: Best Lemonade made
review/text: I have been buying Lemonade in the 2 quart bottles and at 1.25 to 1.69, it was getting too expensive. So shopping one day I saw Kool-aid on sale at 15 cents a packet, at that price I bought 3 packets, looking at the ingredents it had real lemon pieces in it. So I bought 5 pounds of sugar at 2.19, as you have to add sugar to the contents.<br /><br />My Recipe is<br /><br />pour contents of one packet in a 2 cup glass measurer, add 1 1/4 cups of sugar enough water to make thin syrup, save a couple 2 quart bottles, pour contents in to bottle and add water to about 9/10 full, cap and shake. Add about 1 ounce or 2, of fresh lemon juice, to add a little tartness. I use however Sicilia lemon juice which is not from conentrate, and to me better than lemon juice, (I add just a squirt), because they also add the oil of the lemon. WOW! now you have great lemonade 10 times better than any bottle stuff or condense powder stuff. If you want pink lemonade, I just add a squirt of Strawberry syrup. Your cost for 2 quarts of the best lemonade you can drink is just about 30 cents. I just couldn't believe that KOOL-AID, made such a great product. Please try it, I find that a added quarter<br /><br />of cup of sugar, makes a big difference, and so a squirt of lemon juice. The only lemon juice I use now is Sicilia, which you should fine in the produce section, I advise not to use Real lemon(in no way is it real lemon) as it is from concentrate and has that preservative taste. Enjoy you won't be sorry!

review/text: Does it taste more like honey or more like mustard?  I change my mind every time I use it.<br /><br />Until I bought this stuff I had never tasted honey mustard that had a distinct honey flavor.  This absolutely does, and it is completely delicious.  I enjoy both honey and mustard and could not be happier with the combination in this jar.  The blend is perfect for my tastes.  It's sweet but still tangy - I could eat this out of the jar it's so good.

review/summary: Think sawdust...
review/text: This is the most flavorless granola I have ever tasted. It's not so much 'bad', per se, as it is just tasteless. Oddly, honey is the second ingredient yet there is not even the slightest hint of sweetness. No hint of cinnamon either. The only occasional flavor comes when you are lucky enough to get a raisin which are few and far between. Even at the current S&S price of $2.59 a bag, this is overpriced and not worth it. Sorry BOM, this is a big, big miss!

review/summary: Not Very Good, But a Good Price
review/text: First I must say that this is not my kind of granola. I love crunchy granola, not soft, and this one is definitely soft.<br /><br />Cons: The oats had a burnt flavor that tended to overpower the cinnamon and raisin flavors. There were very few clusters.<br /><br />Pros: The price is very good for granola. Typically granola costs more than $4 per bag but with Subscribe & Save you can get this one for under $3 per bag.

review/text: Soooo disappointing.  The granola ingredients sound fabulous, but were misleading. The granola is NOT crunchy, but soft.  One bag was visibly molded and not worthy of even opening.  So much for "good things coming in small batches".  I purchsed this thru subscribe and save..that's been discontinued. Looks like KIND brand at Amazon gets my business.
