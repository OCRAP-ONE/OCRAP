review/summary: Good price
review/text: My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed "stuff". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!

review/summary: My cat loves this, and even I think it smells good!
review/text: I've bought several flavors of the b.f.f. line for my cat, and she chows down on every one of them! Even my roommate's cat, who is extremely picky with wet food (to the point that there is literally only one brand he would eat at all) has been caught sneaking tastes out of her bowl now! This stuff is very high grade - if you check out the b.f.f. site, they make all of their items in a human food processing facility, and there is no grain filler in the food. When opening the cans, it really smells like something you'd open up to eat yourself! I love this product and I will continue to buy it for my baby.

review/text: I have 2 picky eaters at home and have bought many of the other very expensive popular brands of cat food without luck. I was thrilled to find these, and thrilled to know that my cats love all the different flavors that they offer. Yes it is on the spendy side, but at least I'm no longer giving away the other expensive brands that they wouldn't eat (because I misplaced the receipt or didn't return them on time). I love bff! And very cool that there is a veggie option to throw into the mix.

review/text: I was looking for a cat food without grains, and read the reviews on this line of cat food. So I took a chance and ordered it hoping my cats would like it. YES they do. I have 2 male cats one 12 yrs and one 7 yrs. The 7 year old has IBS and vomits most cat food up. He has not vomited this up once. (YEAH!) My older cat eats this and leaves most of the Fancy Feast I put in their bowls. I am so glad I found this as I believe that the grains and fruits they put in cat food is not good for them.

review/summary: A winning combination
review/text: Two of my cats are very picky eaters most of the time and will only eat kibble or straight up canned tuna. They even turn their noses up at canned salmon and sardines. Even though this food is all fish, I was afraid they might snub it, too, and they normally don't like canned cat foods at all. But they love this. The food has a lot of tuna, but you can tell it has the chunks of tilapia in it. My cats didn't hesitate to eat all of it. I intend to try the other flavors to get some variety in their diet.<br /><br />And I liked that this canned food is very densely packed, not soupy. I just add a little water if the cats need it wetter.

review/summary: Extremely high quality cat food at affordable price
review/text: I love BFF by Weruva because it's incredibly healthy, with only quality meats and supplements and no grains or by-products, but is so much cheaper than any other "premium" brand of comparable quality out there.  I don't even know how they manage to keep the price so reasonable.  The difference in quality is obvious when you open the can, as the food hasn't been ground into unrecognizable oblivion but still has identifiably shredded meat and looks a healthy flesh color, not some unsatisfying 'blah' brown.  I'm a student, so I'm on a very tight budget, but it's worth it to me to purchase BFF for my cats because I believe in preventative care.  Feed my cats well from the beginning and they'll live long, healthy, happy lives with less health problems that will leave me with expensive vet bills.  As for now, my cats and kitten gobble it up in a second flat.  It's obvious they love every flavor I've tried with them (and one is even quite picky).  Their fur is like silk, too.  This is clearly a great food.

review/summary: BFF Tuna and Bonito Be Mine, 5.5 oz. 8-pack
review/text: I recently upgraded to higher quality canned food, first trying the standard Weruva offerings and now the BFF (a Weruva sub-brand?) I like that BFF offers flavors with gravies and others with aspic, as it increases feeding time variety. BFF is certainly a good value compared to the other high-end natural and grain-free products, and even my pickiest senior guy enjoyed the tuna and bonito variety. I will continue purchasing the standard Weruva in Paw Lickin' Chicken since my boys love it, but we are happy to mix it up with BFF. The inclusion of the skin on some fish pieces is certainly a confidence-booster that my cats are getting real food, not mystery meat. I also appreciate the 5.5 ounce can size, as we can share a can each feeding and both cats get their fill.

review/text: Out of all of the various types of cat food I've bought, the Tuna and Bonito is definitely the best for my cat.<br />He likes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken</a> more, but given an equivalent amount of this BFF vs the Chicken, he tends to stay happier longer.  He tends to beg for food, and after eating this, he won't beg for almost the full 12 hours between feedings (vet's orders!), while with many other foods, he'll start begging way before that.

review/text: I did place an order with Amazon for this particular item, but it was canceled because the supplier at the time was not able to provide it (it was not PetFoodDirect - I have had excellent service from them through Amazon).  I managed to order the 4Eva through another source, and the kitties like it.  It was something I wanted because the majority of BFF (and Soulistic, made by the same company) are tuna based (other fish added too, but mostly tuna and fish).  Once in a while it would be nice to have something else;  we get tired of the same thing every meal too!  In general the BFF foods are a good choice - better quality, not outrageous prices.

review/summary: My Cats Refuse To Eat It
review/text: My cats have rejected Tuna and Chicken Chuckles, but I'm only docking it one point for that because I don't think it is the food's fault. It looks just fine, mostly red tuna mixed with shreds of chicken, (there is way more tuna than chicken, the chicken shreds are almost like a condiment). My cats like other flavors of BFF, they just wolfed down a plate of Tuna Too Cool for dinner, but they do not like this one. I've tried feeding it to them several times and they just don't like it. One of them ate a bit of Tuna & Chicken Chuckles and threw it up and the other just refused to touch it. My cats are really picky, though. I'll donate the rest of the case of this to my local shelter where I'm sure the kitties will find it a glorious treat and get my feline food critics something else.

review/text: Read the labels before you buy. All the flavors of BFF list the following two ingredients at the top of their lists: Tuna & water. Every can is just low quality, dark gray, shredded tuna.  The company adds a trace of other ingredients so they can claim to have several flavors, but don't fall for their tricks! Rather, when you want to give your kitty some tuna for a treat, just feed him/her some regular tuna--the good kind humans eat.  Not only is it far superior quality, but it's cheaper, too!

This stuff may be good for cats but if they don't even want to eat it, whats the point? Here's some advice save your money and buy your cat what is good for them but at the same time something they enjoy, that's what your best feline friend deserves, not this stuff.

This product costs a little more than the traditional dog snack, but its got none of the bad ingredients that will make your dog sick (note: its a one pound bag so it lasts a long time). Its all salmon and organic brown rice. They don't smell like traditional dog snacks, they Smell So Good that you may want to try them. Best of all your pup will love them and you're doing something good for him. My pup recognizes the bag and knows that a treat is coming. Note: these are also great for training, they are easily broken into smaller pieces.

review/summary: Quality Product That Dogs Will Love!!!
review/text: My dog will do anything for these Salmon Treats.  I love that they are made in the USA!!  I would  not hesitate to try these treats as I am certain your dog will love them as much as mine does.  The fact that they are all natural is a huge plus in my book.  I also give my dog the duck treats from Plato and he loves them as well.  The duck ones are great if your dog suffers from food or skin allergies, the duck treats will not induce itching!  I will purchase another variety of these treats the next time I place an order.  I am sure he will love anything Plato makes!!!

review/text: My dogs love Salmon Strips. They wait at the door each night for their treat. Two of my dogs came to us with serious skin problems that I keep in control by feeding them high quality grain-free food. These treats don't cause any problems and my dogs love them so much that they will do anything for an additional treat: even take a bath.

He LOVES these Salmon Strips and, truthfully, they smell good enough for human consumption.  Thanks for making a very nutritional snack/treat.  My dog gives you a 5+ paws!

review/summary: Out dog loves salmon strip treats!
review/text: The Plato salmon strips are a healthy treat. We use them for training and rewards. They are a good value from this  supplier. Also, the strips contain oils, which are good for our young dog's fur and skin. I also give them to my daughter's three dogs when I take care of them for her, and they look forward to seeing my and my package of treats.

review/text: I purchased a similar product at Costco but they discontinued so found Plato Salmon on Amazon.  They are kind of pricey, smell terrible, and you pretty much have to buy online.  However, my Lab absolutely loves them above any other treat and you will notice, within days, that their coat gets soft and shiny.  That they are made in America is the iceing on the cake.  This is a 5 star product!!!!

review/text: My Boston Terrier LOVES these.  He can be asleep in the upstairs bedroom and come running if he even hears me even touch the bag!  They are smelly, but totally worth it because he loves them so much.  He is normally picky about treats because he is so spoiled, and I make him so many homemade ones (milkbones? he won't put the things in his mouth), but he cannot get enough of these.  It is a plus that they are made in America and healthier for him than other treats.  My boyfriends family also has two Dachshunds and they go insane over these as well.  Also, my roommate's Shihpoo goes crazy when he smells them.

review/text: These are by far the worst smelling dog treats EVER. They have a strong fishy smell (hence the use of real Salmon), however, my dogs LOVE them. They were actually recommended to me since I have a Husky and he has skin problems, as most Huskies do. They don't seem to cure the problem areas of his skin, however, they do help a little. These are probably my dogs' favorite treats!

Left it on the floor where I gave it to her.  Glad the "best by" date is a year out - there are a lot of treats in a 16 oz. bag.  Should have bought 8 oz. bag.  Strong smell (expected with salmon), but odor does not transfer to your hands too badly.

review/text: My dogs have severe allergies and can only consume duck, salmon, white fish and potatoes. Needless to say, finding treats they can eat is challenging. We bought these and the duck strips and I believe it is fair to say that they would jump through burning rings to get to these. My female leaps two feet off the floor when these are offered. I just re-ordered these treats. They are pure salmon with no filler, no corn product, no beef/chicken product...very healthy and they have nice shiny coats from the salmon oil.

But what gives this chocolate bar the unique, fantastic flavor is the small strawberry bits.  I've never had anything like it, and the formula works bigtime.  I ate the whole darn bar in one sitting, thinking I was only going to have a few small pieces!  It's THAT good!

Romney, though, who passes actual fecal matter (on a rather regular schedule, I'm sure), the doll empties its bowels of candy! (it should be noted the candy, thank goodness, is not fecal flavored). This will share a treasured space with my NASCAR toilet seat and my mounted rubber fish that sings Roy Orbison tunes.

review/summary: Contains MSG - very disappointing
review/text: Well, so much for finally getting around to reading the fine print. These Ybarra olives are packed using MSG (monosodium glutamate). I thought that I was getting an exceptional tasting product, only to find that the taste is enhanced using the chemical MSG (to which many persons are sensitive.) The Peregrino Anchovy Stuffed Olive supplied by La Tienda also contains MSG.<br /><br />My opinion is that a superior product should not require artificial flavor enhancement. Unfortunately, the competition (Roland - American Roland Foods) contains MSG. Evidently, the anchovy stuffed product is not tasty enough without the addition of MSG. I can find no other olives at La Tienda or at Roland that contain MSG. So, I guess that my future martinis will no longer be graced with anchovy/MSG olives.

review/summary: Best Falafel Mix on the Market!! :)
review/text: I absolutely love falafel, and have tried a number of different falafel mixes, including Casbah, Ziyad, Swad, Nirav, and Manischewitz.<br /><br />Until I tried Casbah, I liked Ziyad brand the best.  Ziyad cooks well and tastes good, but is not as flavorful as Casbah (which has a stronger flavor than any of the brands I mentioned).<br /><br />Swad and Nirav are good (they taste good but are less flavorful than Ziyad), but do not purchase the Manischewitz.  It does not taste the way falafel is supposed to.  The ingredients indicate that it is made with matzo meal, which is probably why it tastes so vastly different.  It's not that it tastes bad, but it just doesn't taste like falafel.  The packaging is nice... the mix is divided into two separate sealed pouches.  Good for single people.  Quantity wise it is less than the other brands, though.<br /><br />I have not tried Near East or Fantastic Foods brand falafel mix, so cannot comment on the quality of those mixes.<br /><br />Casbah tastes *perfect*.  Spicy, crunchy, very flavorful, just the best.  If you eat this brand you will never eat any of the others again.<br /><br />UPDATE: September 2012: Ziyad has reformulated its falafel mix, and it tastes really yummy now!  So try a box of that if you don't want to spend the big bucks to buy Casbah.  Personally, I felt that Ziyad was so improved that I didn't need to spend the extra energy to hunt down the Casbah packages, or order in bulk from Amazon.  Try it, and see what works for you. ^^

review/summary: Just OK, in my opinion
review/text: I bought this on Amazon because my supermarket doesn't keep the falafel stocked, and most of the time it is sold out. The Casbah 10-pack is a good value and now I have enough falafel to last awhile, and the 10-ounce bag means you can easily cook a up a big batch without having to open multiple packets. But I have to say that the flavor is just OK, not as great as the other review would indicate in my opinion. Actually less spicy than the brand from my local store. Still, it is good. I may buy Casbah again, but probably I will try one of the other brands first.

review/summary: Family's Favorite Falafel Mix
review/text: This is our family's favorite falafel  mix, that which comes closest to the best falafel's we've had in local restaurants.  The flavor is nutty and spicy, and very consistent, box-to-box.  They cook up a nice golden brown-to-brown and have an authentic crunchy consistency on the outside.  When prepared as directed - add water and let sit for ten minutes - it produces a thick batter that holds together well and stays together through frying.  We use a spring loaded falafel patty maker, though I think it would work just as well forming the patties by using a tablespoon.<br /><br />The main reason for a five star review is for flavor and consistency, which are among the best I've found in a mix and - surprisingly - better than what I've had in more than a few restaurants and stands.  It also doesn't hurt that these meet with my Jordanian father-in-law's approval when I do the cooking.  (which, for me, is something akin to a French chef earning a Michelin star...)  Taste is subjective, however, and I've seen arguments arise between falafel aficionados on which ones are the best:  Lebanese, Israeli, Syrian, Greek, etc.  So, before going out and getting a whole case of the stuff, I'd suggest trying one box first.<br /><br />My preference is to fry these in peanut oil (about 1/2 inch in an iron skillet) as I feel peanut oil has a higher burning point than some other oils and think that it produces the best flavor.  Naturally, this is not for the peanut-allergic among you.  I've read that falafel can be baked and the box also gives instructions on this, though I've never tried it.  For serious shoppers, the ingredients list unbleached wheat flour and does not indicate that it contains fava beans.  (It does, of course, indicate garbanzo bean flour as the primary ingredient)  This may or may not matter to purists, but I've gotta go with the taste buds on this one and will be sticking with Casbah.<br /><br />The last point for me is price, or more accurately, value.  While I would prefer to have the option of getting this mix in bulk so as to do without all the packaging, I've only found it by the case:  12 boxes of 10 ounces each.  Still, the cost comes to pennies-per-patty for each falafel versus over a buck-per-patty at our favorite restaurant.  Granted, this does not include the necessary goodies (pickles, tomatoes, onions, and hummus for this particular family) but it's still a fraction of the cost of having our family falafel extravaganza eating out.  If you plan on making this a staple of your diet, the subscription plan saves you even more.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Flavor, consistency, and value are all tops with Casbah falafel mix:  Five stars from this reviewer.

review/summary: Good crunch but CANNOT pass off as homemade
review/text: I bought this with the intent of eating it straight from the box when I'm busy at school and thought it'd be stovetop stuffing quality.  In other words I wasn't expecting the world and that I'd know it would be a bit dry.  I also knew that the recipe for making falafel was dead easy.  But reading all the positive reviews I felt, "well why not".  I need to be  brutally honest and say the only thing worthwhile about this mix is the crunch.  Otherwise it is similar to eating glorified sawdust when prepared as instructed and will never pass as homemade falafel as per another reviewer's commentary.  Honestly homemade isn't hard if you have the kitchenaid hand blender, but the convenience factor was something I was really interested in.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Crunch<br />Convenience<br />Ease<br />Can be baked<br /><br />Cons:<br />Flavour and texture is like sawdust (must soak at least 30 minutes though that won't fix it)<br /><br />Because I had the version from Mediterranean Cafe east of Los Angeles (Pasadena to be specific) one might think I'm picky, but honestly they could have at least tasted what they created and said that you needed to add fresh cilantro, parsley and onion to compensate the texture of the dry mix.  I actually had to guess what was missing then, with a receipe online, and make a brand new batch of falafel from hand in order to fix the flavor and inside texture of this one and my family and I still think it's weird.<br /><br />Simply put if this is the best of the box falafels I'd stay the heck away from all else.  If you feel the same way and you're stuck with 12 boxes, what you can do to fix it is to add some cilantro, onion and garlic until it develops the falafel greenish hue.  I did this and it was definitely much much closer to the falafel I had.  Perhaps I should also add breadcrumbs but a part of me goes "is this honestly necessary!?  Why am I REMAKING falafel?"<br /><br />IMO if convenience is ruined by forcing one to remake the item they're supposed to imitate the product fails.  I am therefore giving one star for the crunch only.

review/summary: Naturally brewed is the only way to go...
review/text: So tasty and savory on just about every vegetable/meat/fish you can come up with!<br /><br />Naturally brewed soy sauce tastes so much better than the 'other' type of soy sauces.<br /><br />From the Kikkoman website:<br /><br />The color of naturally brewed Kikkoman Soy Sauce is a clear reddish-brown, and it is well-balanced in terms of flavor and aroma.<br /><br />By contrast, chemically produced soy sauce usually has a cloudy, dark color; its taste is unpleasant and strong, and its chemically produced aroma is obvious.<br /><br />During the natural brewing process, soybean proteins are naturally dissolved by enzymes. Hydrochloric acid is used in chemically produced soy sauce: it does not undergo any form of the brewing process and is generally manufactured within several weeks.<br /><br />As a result, the color, flavor and aroma of chemically produced soy sauce are not natural--they're created artificially using corn syrup, salt, caramel coloring and other additives. It's no wonder that this completely synthetic soy sauce is inferior in every way to naturally brewed Kikkoman Soy Sauce.<br /><br />Kikkoman Soy Sauce and Chinese Soy Sauce<br /><br />Here we explain the differences between Kikkoman Soy Sauce and Chinese soy sauce.<br /><br />Types of Chinese Soy Sauce<br /> There are two types of Chinese soy sauce: dark and light.<br /><br />Chinese dark soy sauce is very deep in color with high viscosity, and it contains additives such as caramel coloring and monosodium glutamate (MSG). Chinese light soy sauce has a lighter color with lower viscosity. In general, this soy sauce contains MSG and other additives used to control its strong saltiness.<br /><br />Differences Between Kikkoman Soy Sauce and Chinese Soy Sauce<br /> The major differences between Kikkoman and Chinese soy sauce can be found in their ingredients and brewing methods. In terms of ingredients, Kikkoman Soy Sauce uses wheat, which creates the aroma of soy sauce. Chinese soy sauce utilizes wheat flour and bran, and when these are used, the aroma of the soy sauce is significantly weakened. Wheat is indispensable to the rich aroma of Kikkoman Soy Sauce, which stimulates the appetite.<br /><br />During brewing, Kikkoman Soy Sauce utilizes microorganisms such as lactic acid bacteria and enzymes in the fermentation process. These are the elements that produce the full-bodied flavor and rich aroma unique to Kikkoman Soy Sauce.<br /><br />Chinese soy sauce undergoes very little fermentation; it has both weak aroma and flavor owing to the lack of this fermentation, and to cover these defects, MSG and other additives are used.<br /><br />Both of these products are called soy sauce--yet the two are completely different, not only in flavor and aroma, but also in terms of their ingredients and production processes.

review/text: I have had my Keurig for ten days now.  Since I was waiting for my Amazon-ordered Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf to arrive via Fed Ex, I was using the free variety sampler pack that came with the machine.  I was certain that the whole Keurig thing was hype.  The coffee was weak.  The coffee was fruity-winy, just what I dislike in my coffee mug.  I had even tried the hot chocolate and thought it was about the same as Swiss Miss in an envelope:  crappy-tasting and limpid.  Last night, things started to look up:  I had a Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Spice herbal tea, and that was verrrry good.  And today, my Dark Magic arrived.  Just had two cups.  It's dark.  It's rich.  It's bold.  It's smooth.  It accepts my half-and-half and stands up to it.  It's a heckuva cup of coffee.  Maybe I'll keep the Keurig after all.

review/summary: Rich, Full-Flavored and Non-Acidic
review/text: Recently my cardiologist forced me to give up my beloved coffee with caffeine. I have always been a coffee addict drinking up to 7 cups a day of Green Mountains darkest, richest blends. Sometimes for added oomph I would add a shot of espresso. So imagine my chagrin when forced to give up my beloved coffee? You may ask yourselves why was I giving up coffee? Why wasn't I switching to decaf? Well, lets say that what I remember from the past was that decaf coffee wasn't delicious. It was rather nasty to my taste buds. Sanka Instant and Postum...blech.<br /><br />Since I had been drinking Green Mountain Dark Magic WITH caffeine, I decided to try it in the decaf form. And WOW. What a difference from those weak wanna be coffees that taste like warm water that a brown crayon was dipped in and called coffee.<br /><br />Testing Dark Magic against the French Roast decaf...well thank god Dark Magic is even better since the French Roast Green Mountain will no longer be available.  At least according to Keurig when I asked them.<br /><br /> I had previously thought that the French Roast was the best and that the Dark Magic rated a distant third, but I have a feeling that I had gotten a bad batch since what I have been drinking is excellent.It is surprisingly rich, full flavored, non-acidic and with none of the aftertaste that some coffees can have. I don't think for one minute that I would be able to tell the difference if I was to be served this in a blind taste test.<br /><br />Well this just goes to show that sometimes the past and how we remember things can come back to bite us on our you know whats. I would have been truly suffering had I not found this product!

review/summary: A way for a coffee drinker to enjoy decaf
review/text: I'm a coffee drinking fiend, but the caffeine ups and downs were really starting to wear on me.  I've been hesitant switching to decaf coffee becuase I thought I had to give-up the bold taste that I enjoy so much.  Green Mountain's Extra Bold decaf was the answer.  I still enjoy that bold coffee taste, but without the sluggish affects of the caffeine lull later.  It's a win-win!

review/summary: Impressive Decaf
review/text: I managed to taste this before purchasing and I have to say, in taste and character, it is easily equal to its non-decaffeinated counterparts. It makes a hearty cup with no bitter aftertaste. My sister in law likes to mix it with flavored coffee for strength (as the Green Mountain flavors tend to be on the light side), I like it on its own. An impressive decaf.

review/summary: Extra Bold Decaf is fantastic
review/text: I gave up caffeine September of 2011.  Dark Magic Extra Bold decaf tastes like a caffeinated coffee.  It's hard to drink any other kind (except Starbucks decaf at a Starbucks location).

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: I am happy to have ordered this coffee. It is a strong dark coffee with a bold taste. I would recommend this to all people who like coffee, and worry about going decaf.
