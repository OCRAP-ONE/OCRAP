review/summary: Forget Cookies & Milk, Try Wine
review/text: I host wine tastings for a living and I was looking for something different to pair the wines with other than Cheese and Chocolate. I came across these Cookies that are specifically made to pair with wine.  I decided to give it a try.  I got my friends together for a Wine & Cookie Party.  We first tried the Zesty Lemon with some Sparkling. One sip, one bite, another sip and OMG it was perfect. Then we tried the shortbread with the Pinot Noir and again it was amazing. Next time you want cookies and milk, try with some wine instead. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YVPXQW">Cookies & Corks Wine Pairing Variety, 6.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>

review/text: I haven't tried the cookies yet but loved the idea of buying this to have on hand for hostess gifts.

Still an awesome collection and very creative, they were delivered quickly and look great -bring on the parties and I'm set.

review/summary: Too expensive
review/text: I had these cookies at a local winery in a cookie wine tasting.  The idea was so different, I bought these to host a wine tasting at home.  But I wasn't really sure what I was getting for the price.  Turns out not very much.  There are just 3 packs of from 3-5 small cookies in each box.  The 3-cookie pack is actually 3 sandwich cookies, so it isn't really less than the packs with 5 cookies if you look at it by weight I guess.  Overall, you are paying quite a bit for a few small cookies.  You could do better baking something yourself or buying a few similar varieties like shortbread, lemon,  and peanut butter chocolate and maybe some savory cheese crackers or something.  I won't buy again -- price is just too high.

I was only spot treating, to help obtain an even skin tone but it did not help at all and caused more problems. I stopped using this tube long ago.

review/summary: EXCELLENT-I'M BUYING MORE
review/text: Both of my feet were swollen for months, and I can't take diuretics. My acupuncturist suggested I drink dandelion tea, so I bought this product and gave it a try. In less than two weeks my left foot was back to normal, and now after using almost the entire box my right foot is about 97% there. I follow the instructions for a "decoction," which means I boil the teabags for 20 minutes. I make two cups at a time, drinking one hot and refrigerating the other and drinking it cold later on. I drink one to two cups a day, sometimes skipping a day. I'm not sure what else dandelion tea helps with, but for this alone it's worth it.

review/summary: Best Ever - Want To Try All Of Douwe Egberts Now
review/text: I was looking for a decaf coffee as the Eight O'Clock Decaf whole bean I have on subscription was not available. I found this brand & so glad I ordered it. I totally love the flavor of Douwe Egberts Real Coffee Decaf and am seriously considering switching from my usual Eight O'clock Coffee. Just wish this decaf was available in whole bean like the Eight O'clock. This Douwe Egberts coffee is so tasty, slightly bold yet not bold, very flavorful and not acidic. It has a flavor that is hard to describe - definitely not sharp,  it's slightly sweet but real coffee flavor. I've been adding it to my other coffees not so much for less caffeine, but for the wonderful flavor that's lacking in my other 'favorite' coffees. Douwe Egberts Real Coffee Decaf is tops.

review/summary: Excellent coffee at a good price!
review/text: We started drinking Douwe Egberts coffee over 5 years ago after we had it served at a local restaurant.  It was so good we asked what kind it was.  (It tasted like Kahlua and Cream, but without any alcohol!).  We learned that their coffee was made from a frozen concentrate, called Douwe Egberts, a Dutch company.  I searched online for a place to purchase it, but apparently you can only buy the frozen concentrate through a food service supplier (in huge quantities), so I began purchasing the Douwe Egberts ground coffee.  It's not as good as the frozen, but is still an excellent coffee.  I have been buying it now for several years and to get the best price, I signed up for the automatic shipping, every couple of months.  I've been very happy with the service as well as the coffee.

review/summary: The best coffee yet!!
review/text: I've compared sooo much decaf & 1/2 caf coffee. I almost felt like throwing in the towel. I began drinking k-cups (can't go wrong) but they're very costly over time. I happen to spot Douwe Egberts Decaf, read the positive reviews & decided to give it a try. I'm very very pleased! I couldn't tell it was decaf either, tastes as strong as many other caffeines I've tried! Plus it's tastes like a high quality coffee! I not only love the coffee, I now will save money on k-cups & it tastes just as good!! Trust me, I've tested them all & I'm sure decaf & caffeine drinkers alike will be pleased. Note: consider using the brown paper filters (Melitta is great) You can't go wrong - it separates any left-over grind residue. Two (2) tablespoons of coffee + 3 cups of water = Perfect large cup of coffee!!

review/summary: ekobrewers beware:very fine grind
review/text: this is too fine of a grind to work well with the ekobrew for Keurig machines. It takes forever to drip out and seems to strain the machine. I will either have to break out a French press or mix this with a coarser coffee to use with the ekobrew. It seems to have a good flavor but really can't compare since I really wasn't that successful with the ekobrew. I will also try using half as much in the ekobrew and make a smaller cup to see if that works. The Coffee Tea and Bean company's grind along with Starbucks works great with the ekobrew adapter. I may wind up just using their coffees. Experimenting via Amazon can become expensive. I am not saying this is bad coffee.....just that it is a very fine grind.

review/summary: tastes better than store jerky
review/text: The flavors of the spices are right on for what I expect from jerky we've bought at the store, but making it ourselves made the taste much better because it wasn't stale and hadn't picked up any off flavors from being stored with other products. One seasoning packet flavors an entire pound very strongly. Used with 2 pounds it was a bit too weak, so I wouldn't try to get more than 1 1/2 pounds out of 1 packet. The instructions indicated the jerky could be stored in a cool dry place and did not need refrigeration. Also, it was very informative on how to store the jerky, how long it would last, and what containers it could be kept in.

review/text: No complaints...good seasoning...I used the same batch several times with good results...the material was hardened in a couple of packs...which didn't defer from the quality....I make my own marinade...and the original and Teriyake were OK..the spicy was VERY VERY good which I can't duplicate...forget the variety pack...if you like a kick go for the spicy which is really awesome...

review/text: Prompt arrival of product. I haven`t actually used any of it yet, but, it is the same as the samples that came with my dehydrater and that made good tasting jerrky. I only made 2 batches. One batch with 97/3 burger and one was sirloin no fat i striped into slices my self. Burger has the spice mixed in it at the start. The meat strips had to be marinated in the spice mixed with water to soak up the spice. marinate in refrigerator for 4-6 hours. I did put far more water than it called for per pack of spice to have enough to liquid to be above the level of the meat in the marinating bowl. I thought it would be a waste of the liquid left over after marinating, bit I just put the remainder in the freezer to use/add to, next time. I don`t think freezing the left over liquid spice will hurt it one bit. I will see next batch of jerky, and may remember to update this review.

review/text: I bought this Nesco jerky seasoning kit, and we enjoyed all the flavors a lot.  They are just salty and spicy enough without going overboard.<br /><br />However, it quickly becomes an expensive way to make jerky if you check the shipping costs!  It pays to shop around online, and check out outdoor supply stores too.

It had never occurred to me to build a shed out of it, as suggested in the product's description.  One must have to really overdry the meat for it to hold up structurally.  What happens when it rains?  And how many pounds of sliced beef would be required?  It seems like wood would be a lot less expensive building material.  But not nearly as tasty!

I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****

review/summary: Didn't like the taste; High protein/grain free = issues
review/text: My family recently adopted a 15 lb. Chihuahua mix who was found abandoned... we didn't know what she had eaten beforehand, but I'm guessing it wasn't anything high-quality due to the condition of her teeth and coat.  My goal was to get her on a high-quality diet (a "6/6" rating), and researched high protein/grain free diets and the benefits of them.  Additionally, I read up on Innova/Evo and understood that their products are extremely high quality, and someone else on a forum recommended we try the Red Meat Small Bite kibble with her.<br /><br />Even at first sniff, my dog indicated she didn't like it.  Of course, I figure it would take some time, so I worked on transitioning her off of the other kibble she was on.  It basically came down to the fact that she would only eat the Innova Evo when it was mixed in with some wet food, and oftentimes only with a bit of cottage cheese mixed in.<br /><br />Shortly after being on this high-protein diet (we didn't even finish her small bag of food), she began to urinate around the house, which she hasn't done in the 5 months we've had her.  It turns out she had urinary crystals, which the vet attributed to the high protein levels of her diet.  We had to put her on Flagil, and the vet recommended I put her on Hill's Science Diet c/d (which I know is full of corn and grain fillers).  After politely declining, I changed her diet to something more holistic that DOES have grain (a "4/6" rating).  She's fine now...<br /><br />Innova/Evo is an extremely high quality brand... perhaps it's better for larger and very active dogs.  I know not ALL dogs may have this reaction to a high-protein diet, but I really think people need to understand that high-protein/no grain isn't always the smartest choice in terms of your dog's health.  In our case, it turned out to be much more costly for us and more stressful for our dog to make this switch.

review/summary: Great Dog Food
review/text: I love this dog food. I was looking for something that was higher is protein to help my dogs fur and one that had higher quality ingredients with no by products. This works well for my dogs ( Maltese/ Yorkie mis and a Maltese/poodle mix). I had read reviews that higher protein was not good for smaller dogs so I called my vet and was assured that it would be good for them. My Morkie has always had stinky breath but I have noticed a slight increase in it but that is taken care of mostly with teeth brushing and puppy breath strips. My Maltipoo's breath is unaffected and fine. The only downside to the food is the cost and being able to find it. We currently order it online but are trying to get a local private pet store to carry it.

My Maltese and my Golden Retriever maintained there ideal weight and their coats were beautiful.<br />The food is a bit more expensive than the junk food with all the fillers but my dogs are worth it.

review/summary: Not for my Miniature Schnauzers
review/text: First I will say I love most Innova Evo products and feed my three Miniature Schnauzers the chicken formula which was the original recipe.<br /><br />Before I had found Evo, my Miniature Schnauzers were fed a RAW diet (aka BARF)which was great but unfortunately one of the girls started getting sick on raw chicken because of the fat content.<br /><br />Innova Evo's red meat recipe came out much later than the Innova Evo's chicken formula and I decided to try it to give them a change of taste. Unfortunately two of my dogs couldn't take the change even though I did it on a very gradual reduction of Innova Evo's chicken formula to Innova Evo's red meat formula.<br /><br />Any little amount of the Innova Evo's red meat formula (10% Innova Evo's Red Meat to 90% Innova Evo's Chicken) gave two of my Schnauzers bad diarrhea after eating it and after a week of trying to convert them all gradually I decided that it wasn't worth it and took it to back to the store where I purchased it from and they allowed me to trade it for the chicken formula. I placed all of my Schnauzers back on Innova Evo's chicken formula and they were fine.<br /><br />I don't know why Innova Evo's Red Meat formula caused two of my Miniature Schnauzers diarrhea (each time I fed them this) but I don't think it's the red meat, I think it's what ever else is mixed in with the red meat which may have caused it or perhaps I just had a bad batch.<br /><br />The reason I believe this is because I have given all three Schnauzers meaty beef neck bones before in the past and they were fine.<br /><br />Whatever it is I'm not going to try Innova's EVO Red Meat formula again and take my chance.

review/summary: Great Product But Not for Every Dog
review/text: It totally makes sense that dogs are carnivorous so we should be feeding them a meat type diet.  However, one must look at what their dog was bred for.  Many of the toy breeds were bred to be companions and fed foods from their owners plates and pantries, so the meat theory doesn't really apply to such breeds.  Such was the case with my Scottish Terrier/Chihuahua mix.  I was all for the meat theory and tried to feed her this food but her little stomach just couldn't handle so much protein.  It just seemed too rich for her.  Also, her breath began to smell terrible!  I've switched to another all natural/fit for human consumption type of dry puppy food and her stomach and system are back to normal.  That being said, my daughter has an Airdale Terrier and feeds her the regular Innova dog food, is very pleased, and would never use anything else.  This manufacturer certainly seems dedicated to producing all natural pet food with no by-products.  So- good brand, high quality, but each dog is different and so are their dietary needs.  I suggest always purchasing the smallest available size bag and testing it first (with any brand of dog food).

(caused puking, muscle spasms) So I clipped the proof of purchase and mailed in my receipt as the guarantee asked. I got a coupon in the mail for a small bag of food! For one, the coupon is for a smaller bag of food. Two, I requested a refund....why would I give the same food to my dog and make him sick? I called customer service and they said you can only get refunds from the retailer! Ok, now that you took my receipt how do I do that? The customer service for Evo was unhelpful and was not able to help my situation. Apparently it is not a true satisfaction guarantee.

review/text: Have a Pom and Pom-Chi that love this food.  Most food they fight over it for about 2-3 days, then grow tired of it.  This one they can go considerably longer without tiring of it.  Also, foods of this quality you can change every few days so they do not tire of it and it does not effect their stomachs like the cheaper foods.  Funny thing is the price usually dictates how much they like it, which is true in this case.  At the end of the day, a 6.6 lb bag goes a long time with toy dogs, so price is not an issue.  Besides, I would rather they have something they like and will eat and is healthy for them.  I buy this in our local pet store at a comparable price, with no shipping cost obviously, just state tax.

However, I found the candy to be on the oil-rich side as apposed to creamy.  One or two and you don't really object.  I bought these on sale and would not have bought them at the suggested retail.  For what I paid, I am pleased enough.

review/summary: Only one of the 6 types was was good
review/text: There are six different types.  Some are terrible such as the vanilla honey (those two flavors don't belong together).  What I use as a standar for good chocolate is the Ferrero Rocher and Lindor truffles that are found for $3 at walmart.  Of the six types from the package only 2 were better than those chocolates, the rest didn't even come close to $3 dollar chocolate brands.  That's why I give them 2 stars out of 5!

review/text: I've been purchasing Switch through Subscribe and Save for more than a year now.  My family loves it - all flavors and specially Hardcore Apple.<br />My last shipment of Hardcore Apple came damaged with smashed cans.  The box that these cans came in was slightly damaged too.  The box was smaller than my previous shipments, with not enough padding.  I am assuming that the box was damaged during shipping but if the box was bigger with enough padding, the cans could have been safe.  Contacted the Amazon customer service and the problem was solved in less than 10 minutes.  Thanks Amazon!!!

So I really enjoy the option of the delicious red tea, especially at night. The health benefits are also a reason. This is a wonderful tasting tea. This tea is also easier to prepare than some because you just use boiling water. Some like white tea (which is also good  should be made at a lower temp, and as far as I know oolong teas are the same. I just boil a glass of water in microwave til boiling then drop tea bag(s) in the cup.  I use two bags in 12oz cup.

review/summary: Doesn't taste as good as it sounds
review/text: I love white teas and have really enjoyed experimenting with different flavors through Teavana.  Youthberry, White Ayurvedic Chai and Spice of Life are a few of my favorites.  The description of ingredients for Frutto Bianco pearls seems heavenly: kiwi, coconut, and tropical fruit bits.  I read several customer reviews that equated their experience of drinking this tea to lying on a beach in Hawaii (which definitely enticed me!)  However, after thoroughly enjoying most other Teavana white teas, this one was a disappointment.  The aroma (one of my favorite things about these teas) was very mild and not altogether pleasant.  Once brewed, the flavor was just blah.  I only bought a few ounces of it, but it is still here 5 months later.  I am now mixing it up with my other teas just to use it up.  If you prefer a more mellow taste, this may be more appealing to you (and my 7 year old daughter does enjoy the aroma of this one).  Once nice thing about this tea are the "pearls," these white tea leaves are even more unprocessed than other forms and present as lovely round spheres which slowly unfurl once they are brewed.

review/summary: Great for ailing senior cats
review/text: My Molly is 18 years old and has chronic renal failure.  Because of the renal failure, it is very difficult for her to maintain weight.  Catsure is the only thing that does it.  I recently took her to the vet and he was impressed that she had actually GAINED weight (she's always losing)!  I told him about this product and he said the company that makes it has been a highly respected company with veternarians for years.  And our cat LIKES it!  She will eat this on days she won't eat anything at all.  If you have a cat with renal failure, you know how hard it is to get them to eat.  You have to try this, it's been a lifesaver!!!

review/summary: Good for Old skinny Cats
review/text: I bought first bought this product from PetSmart (where it is $8 by the way) for my 15 year old cat who had been mysteriously losing weight.  She loves it, but I cant give it to her too often or she stops eating it.  It turns out that she is hyperthyritic and thats why she lost weight, but since shes only 5 1/2 pounds I still feed it to her a couple times a week even with her thyroid medicines working quite well.  Not all cats like it though.  My other cat, a 7 pound long-hair tuxedo, wont even taste it.  So it depends on your cat.  I would get a can from PetSmart or PetCo first to see if your animal is willing to eat it.  If they are willing to eat it, it does help get needed calories and nutrition into underweight or finicky cats.

review/summary: Finally A Nutritional Product for Seniors
review/text: My cat, Mollie, is 19 years old.  With the exception of a thyroid problem and joints that seem to be getting stiff, she is pretty healthy.  I attribute much of her health to better cat food products over the years.  Many of those healthy foods that she had no difficulty digesting often cause an upset stomach and up it comes.  When I saw Cat Sure on the shelf and read that it was for senior cats, I had to see Mollie's reaction.  She loves it.  I have a separate dish for Cat Sure (she doesn't mix milk with meat; she's kosher) and she will sit next to that dish meowing for me to fill it up.  It does not upset her stomach and now I feel confident she will get the nutrients she needs when her regular foods don't agree with her.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: My cat will be 16 years old this year.  She suddenly started losing weight and acting ill about four years ago after one of my other cats died.  I took her to the vet and was told that her liver was failing and there's nothing that could be done.  While shopping at a local grocery store a couple years ago, I stumbled upon Cat Sure in a bargain bin for $1 a can.  I bought a couple of cans even though they had many just to try it out.  I was desperate at that point to try anything since nothing else worked.  Within two days, my cat showed MAJOR improvement.  She had her spunk back.  Well, I ran out of Cat Sure and she settled back into not feeling very well until recently when I ordered this product from Amazon/KV Vet Supply.  I have been giving it to her daily twice a day since last week.  She is loving it.  I was having a problem with her having diarrhea and throwing up also everyday all day (before giving her the supplement).  As a result, I have had to keep her confined to the kitchen.  Cat Sure has gotten rid of her diarrhea and has almost kept her from throwing up.  My goal is to have her keep food in her belly so that I can have her come out of the kitchen and lead a normal cat's life again.  KV Vet Supply has the lowest price that I have seen for this.  I have seen it elsewhere recently for $8.  It's worth it, but I would rather get two for the price of one here.<br /><br />If your cat is ill, don't hesitate taking them to the vet, but if the vet says there's nothing they can do...don't give up!  Try this stuff!!

review/text: As a huge fan of Keurig brewing, I was delighted to discover Solofill cups!  I have been using mine for a couple months and love the versatility and the ease of using this Kcup replacement.  Unlike the "My Kcup" holder that you can use with most Keurig machines, this little gem pops right in without having to remove the pod holder from the brewer.<br /><br />The Solofill takes about 2 tablespoons of coffee and that's the main appeal of this.  You can use your own ground coffee instead of always having to buy the pricey pre-filled Kcups.  It makes a great cup of coffee and allows users to buy any kind of coffee they please.  Some users have complained about cleaning the Solofill.  I find it easy.  Just tap the cooled coffee grounds on the edge of your trash receptacle and most will fall out.  Then rinse it out and it's ready to go again.  I keep two handy so I can be using one and cleaning the other.  I see this little invention as a great way to save money and have options as to the kinds and types of coffee you want to use.

I didn't think it was difficult to clean using the spray nozzle on the faucet.  Also, be careful not to use super fine grounds (as suggested on the package).  They will plug up the mesh and result in a half brew of coffee so strong it can not be consumed!  Kirkland 100% Columbian-fine ground works well, however.

review/summary: great coffee with no environmental impact
review/text: I love my keurig coffee maker, don't get me wrong, but I don't love adding all those little plastic cups to the land fill. The Solofill allows me to end the conflict between convenience and my concern for the environment.  I can use any coffee I like, or as I frequently do, I can use a pod.  One of the things about the Keurig I love is the ability to choose daily between varieties of coffee.  Buying a pound of one kind of coffee is boring to me. So I buy locally 1/4 bags and store them in a vented airproof (airscape) container. And I buy pods (frequently on sale so the price is the same as ground beans per cup) and dump the grounds into the Solofill. I use 10 gram pods, more is too much, less is not enough. With pods, the coffee remains fresh because it's nitrogen packed. I don't have to drink all the same kind at once to use it up =)  So i balance between my locally purchased fresh ground and the pods. The Solofill brews a much better cup than the K cups provide. Much richer mouth feel, and slightly stronger than an extra bold k cup.<br />I drink mostly dark roasts (k cups: dark magic, double black diamond) and I'm very satisfied with the cups from a Solofill with 10 grams ground coffee, either from a pod or fresh.  The device self-tamps when you close it so the water flows evenly throughout the grounds. No dry spots. I pop the Keurig open after I brew and come back to dump the grounds after I drink; that gives the solofill time to cool off.  The only caveat is to make sure you flick off any grounds on the rim before you close the solofill so it makes a solid seal. I bought two so I can always have one ready to go......
