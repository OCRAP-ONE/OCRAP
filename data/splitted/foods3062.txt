review/summary: Burned beans make for bitter espresso
review/text: This "roast" is absolutely horrible. My first thought upon opening the bag and smelling the beans was, "Akk! These smell like charcoal!"  These beans are not simply dark roasted - they're completely burned. Dreading the results, I attempted to pull a few shots on the espresso machine, There was virtually no crema and the espresso itself was bitter and disgusting. I've tasted better espresso pulled from 6 month old ESE pods! Maybe these beans work better for regular coffee in a percolator machine with a fine paper filter to keep the charcoal out of the decanter; for espresso, they're a horrid failure.

review/text: Starbucks Espresso Roast is my favorite so I was happy to find this on the gold box savings, although I'm sure it wasn't much cheaper than anywhere else outside of Starbucks.  TBH, I didn't do the math.  What influenced me was perceived savings, plus a $20 Amazon gift certificate credit.  I'm happy.

review/summary: Just what I needed!
review/text: I go through whole bean espresso rather quickly, and I was sick of having to stop by Starbucks just to grab a bag (I prefer to brew my own). Having a 3-pack of espresso delivered to me is wonderfully convenient and I hope that Amazon will continue to stock it. Thank you for the free shipping offer, it is even more incentive to re-purchase. In terms of the actual coffee: it is bold, it is delicious, and it is a pretty good value.

review/summary: Agree, This Stuff is Horrible
review/text: I agree with the woman from Arizona: Starbuck's Espresso Roast is burned and bitter. I already knew this but, like her, purchased a bag of whole beans when I ran out of my favorite (Black Cat from Intellegentsia). Starbucks beans were burned (black and oily) and the Starbucks espresso from my Expobar was terrible (virtually no crema, bitter, sour.) I can not believe Starbucks gets away selling this crud. Anyway, shipment of Black Cat came in a few days later and the difference is night and day. If you have a good machine and you are using Starbucks in it, then do yourself a favor. Seek out truly good coffee and give it a try.

review/summary: Dense, Caramelly Sweetness? No. Just bitter coffee.
review/text: First of all, I didn't buy this product from Amazon. We ran out of our favorite "Colombia Bellavista" and ended up buying Starbucks' Espresso Roast at our local store.<br /><br />After we opened the package, we smelled the beans and thought that they were burnt, but it didn't stop us from brewing 2 cups. Well, it was indeed burned and tasted very bitter. Actually, it was disgusting, and I don't remember the last time when I was so disappointed in a product. We couldn't believe that Starbucks would sell such a horrible coffee, so we double checked the expiration date to make sure we didn't get some old batch. Oh well, according to the label it was good till March 2010, but in reality it should have never passed a quality control (if there is any).<br /><br />If it makes any difference, we have Jura-Capresso Z5 machine, and I don't know how this coffee tastes if you pass it through a regular coffee maker. Anyway, this was not a quality coffee by any standards. Bitter doesn't mean bold/strong/dark roast; bitter means poorly roasted coffee. The stronger you roast the coffee, the more harsh it tends to get. There is a chance we got a bad batch, who knows, but for now I have to say goodbye to this Starbucks product.<br /><br />P.S. If you really love coffee, go to your local Target and try Archer's Farm coffee in a silver tin which has a label "2009 Cup Of Excellence Winner". You will have to pay $14 for 10 oz of coffee (2d place winner), but considering Target paid $13/lb for it at the Cup of Excellence Coffee Auction, they are not making that much money on it.

review/text: I was originally purchasing this at Petfood Express in San Francisco. Then I saw it was cheaper at Amazon and started buying from there. The food that came from Amazon was lighter in color and had more dusty/small particles of food throughout. The food is currently back-ordered at Amazon. So I purchased it from the store again, and noticed the difference again.<br /><br />Has anyone else noticed the product varies depending on where it is purchased?

review/text: I received this item as a birthday gift recently.  The outer box with decoration and bow is lovely, and the outer wrappings of the items inside are nice.  However, the actual items themselves were nothing really special for what this box cost (plus shipping!)  3 of the cookies were crumbled and all were on the dry side; the picture frame was NOT the nice gold-gilded victorian frame that is shown in the picture. Instead, I got a heart-shaped white cermanic frame (made in China).  All in all, the outer wrappings & box out-did the actual items inside each wrapper.  I would not have paid anymore than [...] for this item.  Cannot believe it cost [...]!!!

review/text: We sent this basket to my mother in law for Mother's Day and she loved it.  I was worried because she will definitely let us know if she doesn't like something and she really raved about this.  I didn't see the basket in person, but she said the items in it were all very nice.  She was most excited about a package of soap petals that was included.  She said they looked just like dried flowers, but you use one petal at a time as soap.  She'll be using those in her guest bathroom.  The food items were all really good quality and there was a really nice picture frame in the box too.  She also raved about the box itself and plans on using it on it's own.<br /><br />This is the 3rd Art of Appreciation gift basket I've sent as gifts and I always get good responses, so I'd feel confident about sending this as a gift.

review/text: At first bite, the dusting makes these guys a bit bitter, but they you enter a world of a miniature version of a lava cake in terms of a dark chocolate richness that cannot easily be beat! These truffles are so very good without being addicting (so, given a serving--5 pieces--is 19 grams of fat, you won't engorge). They are great to bring as a treat to social gatherings because the box has two packages, so you kinda don't want to keep them at home and risk that they go bad if you don't eat them quickly or that you do eat them all and have a gluttony attack! But, do try... Great quality.

review/text: Really, Amazon states that in the warmer months you should not buy chocolate. But really, what kind of moron buys chocolate by mail in September or August? Have they never seen a postal truck, or UPS.....they drive with their doors open in the warm weather....because they have no AC. Let alone the same two company's tracker trails, you see on the highways....do they look like refrigerator trails to you???? If you even once got a package in one of the summer months....of anything, lets say Books, and felt how warm it was straight from being handed to you from your carrier, would you even dream or ordering chocolate? Now think if you were not handed the package, and it had too sit out in the sun until you found it and brought it inside. So, why blame being a moron on the chocolate. Now I got a box of theses as a Christmas present last Christmas, They were great. I have seen some one star reviews for the 3 box set of these truffles.I think they are from people who do not know what a French truffle is. It's bittersweet chocolate and cream rolled in unsweetened cocoa powder. They are rich and dark...not sweet. These are not like Lindt Lindor's truffles. These are dark and rich....try them.....but not in the summer.

Just make it according to package directions, but leave out the clams and add chicken (from a deli rotisserie chicken if you're in a hurry) and a package of frozen white corn. Delish!  Toss in some of the frozen OreIda hash browns or some diced cooked white potatoes for a whole other soup.

review/summary: Zero mango or chilli taste. Pure sugar.
review/text: I got this because it was the only "chilli mango" with free shipping. A mistake. Sugar is<br /> overwhelming, hiding the mango taste. Chilli and lime are barely and distantly detectable. If you are looking for an expensive generic sweet, this might make you happy. If you are looking for the exotic, multi-layered taste of mango and chilli, look elsewhere.

review/text: Why is it so hard to find Mars bars in grocery stores these days?  Do they just not ship to southeast Pennsylvania anymore?  Am I shopping in all the wrong places?  They used to be really popular 20 years ago.  You'd walk in and there they'd be right next to the Snickers and 5th Avenue bars, but now... I guess they're being pushed to the side for other candy bars.  This is an outrage!  I'm not paying more than 5 bucks for a few candy bars either.

review/summary: Mmm... Mars Bars! :-P~
review/text: I'm guessing you probably already know what a mars bar is, so let's just assume you like 'em. Not a whole lot else to say. If you haven't had an English style mars bar before, I would say that they're one of they're one of the nicer candy bars out there. Well worth trying for anyone who considers themselves a connoisseur of fine junk foods! Do be aware though that judging by some of the other reviews posted, they're NOT quite the same as the mars bars that some buyers may have been expecting.<br /><br />While prices do fluctuate, as of the time of writing this package of 6 will wind up costing you just a fraction over $1.99 a bar. Amazon does sell these bars in packs of more than 6, and bigger the pack you buy, the better deal you get. So if you are able to find a deal that translates as good value from where you sit (and especially if you qualify for free shipping), this seems as good a place as any to buy your chocolate fix. If not, hey, look elsewhere.<br /><br />I took a star off because... Well, just the obvious. Mars bars are bad for you, duh! So please, enjoy in moderation ;-)<br /><br />Theo.

I could've spent that 60 dollars and bought salmon at Sam's Club and smoked it ourselves with 10x the amount of salmon.<br /><br />Overall, the gift box was nice and could be reuse for other purposes, but the overall food package was disappointing. I expected more out of a gift basket such as this. Should be called crackers and fish spread gourmet food gift box, salmon was more like a side.

review/summary: all right by me !!!
review/text: Kraft's Light Balsamic Vinaigrette with Extra Virgin Olive Oil Reduced Fat Dressing (whew, what a long name) helps people like me who are on a diet. The taste is indeed bold but I think some of that "taste" comes from the sodium in this salad dressing. On the other hand, it is indeed made with extra virgin olive oil and that's wonderful. It has just 1 gram of fat in a 2 tablespoon serving (or 32 grams) and just 4 grams of carbs per serving. There are no artificial preservatives and that's a bonus.<br /><br />This is probably even better for your health than Amazon's nutrition facts would indicate. I don't think that Amazon got it quite right when they quoted the caloric content in the nutrition facts table above. On all of the bottles I have of this product (and yes, I matched it up with the picture--it's exactly the same product), the nutrition facts label on the bottles I have indicate that there are only 25 calories total per serving; and a serving consists of 2 tablespoonfuls. In addition, the nutrition facts label on the bottles I have indicate that the amount of calories that come from fat total only 10 calories per serving and not 25 calories as Amazon notes above. I would like to think that the Kraft nutrition label is correct; perhaps Amazon accidentally made a misprint or two above. Unfortunately, the amount of sodium indicated above on this webpage is accurate.<br /><br />Overall, this is great dressing. It tastes great; and it adds a punch to any salad. I simply can't find any salad dressing with fewer calories than this although you might have to watch it on the sodium if that's an issue for you. If you are on a salt-free diet check with a nutritionist or doctor first to make sure that this dressing is something you can enjoy on your salads. I use it on salads that have a mixture of romaine and iceberg lettuce with some carrots thrown in; and I'm sure it would go with a spinach salad as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!

So easy! On those days when I just want to stick something in the oven and settle in front of the TV until it's done, this dressing makes fixing the night's entree so very, very easy. Thanks Kraft!

review/summary: this is marshmallow-y texture
review/text: I've had a lot of different types of curds; different flavors and different companies.  Diickensons', I know from previous experience is a very good company.  Their product is always scrumptious. Typically, the curds that I have had in the past are of a thick smooth consistency, no matter what the flavor.  This coconut curd is not like the typical curds that I've had so far.  It is of a lighter and marshmallow consistency with pieces of coconut throughout.  This was not what I was expecting at all.  I tasted it and it was delicious.  There's a few recipes attached to the top of the jar.  You can mix this with whip cream and use it for a dessert. That would truly be decadent. Use it for the top of a banana cream pie or inside a truffle, if you make candies.  In fact, it reminds me of the middle of a "Mallo Cup", only better, more refined.

review/text: I wrote this review initially as part of an online conversation. I actually bought these at Whole Foods rather than here on Amazon. Anyways, here is the text:<br /><br />"We kind of binged on the crackers yesterday though. They are of the harder variety of cracker, with a very nutty taste and just a hint of residual sweetness from the tamari. I bought the Original flavor, although i saw they had a few different ones. The individual cracker crunch is less a whole bite experience and more a lot of individual texture crunch, which i imagine comes primarily from the sesame and flax seed. Anyways, i like them. They are listed as having saturated fat, and at first i was wondering how that could be, but then i read further, and they actually explain that it is naturally occurring due to the flax, sesame, and quinoa."<br /><br />A great vegan option without the transfats, hydrogenated oils, GMO's, and are both whole grain and gluten free. I recommend them highly.<br /><br />Enjoy!

To get away from all the popular soft drinks and their high sugar content or dangerous artificial sweeteners, I use this product to produce a safe lightly sweetened summer drink.

review/summary: Fresh with great taste and aroma coffee
review/text: I have been drinking the top brands of Turkish and Greek coffee, but the first time I tried the Albanian Coffee Skenderbeu and I love it. It has great taste, aroma, it is fresh coffee and makes more foam that the Turkish or Greek coffee. Unlike most of the Turkish and Greek coffee that are imported from overseas, I found out that the Albanian coffee beans are imported from Brazil and roasted and grind in Canada. When you order it is shipped directly from the manufacturer. This is fresh. If you are Greek or Turkish coffee drinker, I suggest Albanian Coffee Skenderbeu.

review/summary: Disappointing to awful
review/text: Of the other Lavazza coffees we've tried our opinion of them goes from very good to excellent so I did not hesitate to buy a can of Lavazza "drip coffee" when we needed a can of coffee in a hurry. A mistake.<br />The first thing you notice when you open the can is the color of the coffee - it's more of a cinnamon color, has an uneven course grind and looks very, very dry. After brewing a pot we found the flavor to be just awful. The flavor would best be described as sour.<br />So glad that this wasn't the first Lavazza product we'd tried as I would not have taken the chance to try the other, much more enjoyable coffees produced by them.

review/summary: Not what it used to be
review/text: I used to buy this coffee a lot a few years ago and it was hands down the BEST coffee I had ever had. Recently though I bought a can and the taste was god awful. Like some other reviewers said, sour is the best word. I thought I had gotten a bad can so I tried it one last time and again I got a can of sour, disgusting coffee. They must have changed their blend. I have been reading lately that coffee producers are now mixing lesser quality Robusta beans into their blends as a cost cutting measure. I think it must be true because I have found that in the last two years all of the brands I used to love have a completely different taste than they once did. Another one is the Allegro brand. None of their blends are what they used to be. The Allegro Breakfast blend used to be fantastic. Now it is just gross. I haven't had a decent cup of coffee in a good two years now. Do they think people won't notice? I've noticed!

review/summary: The Best Corn Chowder. Period
review/text: It looks like Amazon is no longer stocking this product. That is a shame. It is probably the best corn chowder I have tasted. The label says it will serve 8 to 10 people per package and I can confirm that it does. However, you will need to supply some additional fresh ingredients, like corn, celery, onions, and garlic. Also, the beans need to be soaked for at least 4 hours prior to cooking. Still, the wait is worth it. If Amazon ever brings this back, I would recommend it wholeheartedly. And if not, you can always go directly to the Purely American website to order.

For years, every evening at around 8 pm, she will begin a show for our attention so that we will ask her to perform her repertoire of tricks.  She loves this, and her reward is a half of one of these goodies.  It is a nightly ritual of enormous importance to her, and if we try to reward her with any other treat, she looks at us in amazement and will have nothing to do with the replacement.  It has to be "Happy Hips."  She loves them!  We are also pleased that she loves a healthy treat because, at 2.75 pounds, every ounce she eats has to be good for her.

review/text: Something is wrong with the packaging. The pizza crust was horribly smelly, slimy packaging and inedible crust. Uck! The brand is excellent and I know this because I had it before when I bought it in a store where I used to live. Unfortunately, I moved and I do not have access to a wide array of food products here. So, I bought it online and that was an awful mistake but thankfully the amazon team was good to me once again and it graciously refunded me for this terrible item as I will work on getting that smell out of my head.

Some of them are just fine though.  Also, refrigerating them immediately after receipt did not help.<br /><br />I prefer Boboli pizza crusts.  I can buy both brands locally, but Boboli is easier to find and because the back side of the packaging is fully transparent, it is easier to check for damage before buying.

review/summary: Good value organic white tea
review/text: I found this product at a local Marshall's and was surprised at the pricing (less than 8 cents per bag).  It is a good white tea though others used to Stash or Bentley's will need to make adjustments.  First of all, this is white tea - period. No blackberry, no acai, no mango or other additions for flavor or aroma.  Touch Organic white tea, however, is a milder version of (gunpowder) green tea (milder in color, milder in taste, but still with a smoky hint or aroma). The individual tea bags are wrapped but (unlike Stash) are not sealed in foil. Tea bags --- hence has the usual "tea bag floating" symptom. Water temperature to 190F,  brewing for 90 seconds delivers a good cup of white tea.<br /><br />Since I drink 6 or more cups of tea a day, I have green tea in the morning and white tea (less caffeine) in the evenings.  About two days a week, I also do "fusion" --- one part roobios to two parts white tea --- very enjoyable.

review/summary: False advertising
review/text: This product is falsely advertised as white tea.  On the Amazon website under Important Information it says:  "Ingredients: Organic White Tea."  I opened 1 bag and it did not look or smell like white tea.  I looked on the side of the box and in very small print is says: "Slightly fermented green tea blended with silver buds and silver tea leaves"  This product is listed as non returnable item.  If you want white tea do not get sucked into ordering this by false advertising.  I wanted white tea as it has less caffeine and I do not like the taste of green tea.  This is probably not even organic either.  On this date 8/6/11 this product description says Ingredients: Organic White Tea."  If you see the above green tea anywhere under this product...the 100 count box pack of 4, you'll know they changed the description as I found the green tea ingredients listed for the 24 count box pack of 6 of the same tea.  Someone screwed up.

review/text: They sell these things at trader joe's, which is where I got mine originally. These are decent, IF you don't already know about "Mama Lupe's" low carb tortillas. At only 3 carbs per tortilla, and with the closest consistency and taste of a tortilla you won't find anywhere else-other than in a regular flour tortilla-"La tortilla's" get their behinds handed to them by that brand. Unfortunately (because I love me some Amazon so much), you'll have to buy them at Netrition, where you'll have to pay a flat shipping fee of four dollars and ninety-five cents. In other words, it becomes very well worth it if you end up stocking up on them; which you will. Like this brand, you have to keep Mama Lupe's refrigerated or frozen. Note to Amazon: It breaks my heart when I have to purchase something that can only be bought online, from another website. Bring Mama Lupe's to Amazon, and show the people what a real low carb tortilla taste like. Do it for us. Do it for...America.

They make great breakfast burritos using Soyrizo and 2% cheese. A large wrap with Eggbeaters, .5 oz of 2% cheese and 1 oz of Soy Chorizo comes in at about 270 calories. Some large wraps alone are about 200 calories.<br /><br />The great thing about these wraps, is that even the family members who are not concerned with the nutrition think that they taste great.

I have been on (and occasionally off) a low-carb diet for a few years and I wish I had had these several months ago to help curb any craving for breads.  You really can't get this low of a carb count in regular breads (at least not for a reasonable price) anywhere I have looked.  They hold up well when wrapped with lunch meats, cheeses, etc.  When used as a soft taco shell, there is some tearing as they absorb any juices, like most soft taco shells.  I will be a return customer for these tortillas.

Like all whole wheat produces, they were alittle dry.
