review/text: I've bought many packs of various types of the Crunchies brand dried fruit and they are all excelent in my oppinion. This type of Crunchies is not quite as 'crunchy' as some of the other ones they make but as I sprinkle these on my brakefast cereal, that realy doesn't matter to me. Will buy more of these delicious Crunchies brand snacks!

review/summary: My One year old LOVES them!
review/text: My one year old doesn't eat much fruit, besides bananas, however he can't get enough of these crunchies!  It's a great way to incorporate fruit into his diet, and also makes for an easy "to-go" snack.  Keep a package of wipes handy, because little fingers get mighty bright red/blue with these and will leave you and anything they touch stained.  My husband loves them too, which is why we have a recurring order with subscribe and save.  Not to mention, they are nearly half the price on Amazon vs the grocery store - score!<br /><br />Now, if only there was a way to prevent them from turning to powder after a couple trips in the diaper bag, or from allowing them to get totally soggy with the slightest amout of heat or moisture, then I'd have rated them a 5 star.  But other than that - they are great!

review/summary: Tea India Assam Tea Blend
review/text: I received a box of this tea as a gift from an executive of Tea India after sitting next to him at a dinner party. I have been drinking teas from Assam, India for many years and find this to be one of the richest and smoothest teas I have ever tasted. I normally prefer loose tea but the Tea India company doesn't use bags that become over-bloated with water, as do so many tea companies. The Tea India bags are generous enough in size so that the leaves have room to turn over and porous enough so that water can circulate through the leaves, allowing them to release their full flavor. Sorry Twinings Irish Breakfast and all of Barry's wonderful dark teas, you're going to have to move to the back of the cabinet as soon as my order from Tea India arrives.

review/summary: Alas, not good
review/text: First of all, this was a LOT of tea.  Two large boxes (each over 10" x 6" x 4") that contain a ton of tea bags, each round and filled with a generous amount of tea.  The boxes weigh about 28 ounces each, more than listed.  That's 3 and a half pounds of tea.  And the steeped tea is a nice rich orange color.  And, with regret, I just threw out one unopened box and and the remaining 2/3 of the bags of the other.<br /><br />Why?  Because although the tea starts out tasting rich and good, it turns foul and bitter after several minutes.  At least it does when mixed with moderate amounts of sugar and fresh milk.<br /><br />Although Orange Pekoe refers to a GRADE of tea, having to do with the size of the broken up leaf particles, in North America it is generally thought to refer to the COLOR.  Orange color in tea is a result of oxidation of the tea.  And this tea must be really oxidized, because it does have a rich orange color that appears remarkably quickly, after steeping for as little as 45 seconds.  I've never run across a tea that steeped more quickly.  In an effort to avoid the bitterness that develops, I tried quicker and quicker steeps, and even experimented with cooler water.  But nothing helped.  If steeped too quickly, it just tasted thin and yucky.  I guess there is such a thing as TOO oxidized.<br /><br />Too bad, because the initial taste is good and you sure get a lot of tea.  But unless you drink a full cup in about two minutes, you won't like the taste that develops.

review/summary: Poor quality of product (old/hard) and poor customer service
review/text: Received product within the 4 days; however, tried two pipes and they were hard and tasted old.  Being a black licorice fanatic, that is totally unacceptable!  I emailed them and was told a replacement box was on its way.  Waited over a week and still no replacement.  Emailed them again and inquired as to status and wanted a response....where is replacement and finally if not sent give me a refund.  Finally after no response, Amazon refunded my money.  I usually buy my licorice pipes locally but decided to order thru this company due to it's good rating.  However, I would not recommend them after my experience -- two weeks to not receive my licorice and then have to go buy it locally anyway.  Next time I will save myself the inconvenience and frustration and just go buy it locally....at least I know it will be fresh and not a stale, hard handy that has been sitting on a shelf for who knows how long, plus poor customer service.  Who needs to be treated this way?????

These cookies... not so much. The brownies are so rich and chocolatey that I raced back to amazon and ordered these cookies. There aren't many chips and the ones that are there look like chocolate chips but they don'r taste like them. I gave it 3 stars because this does make an easy base for gluten/dairy free cookies, just add more of your own dairy free choc chips. The choc in the brownies is the premium Ghiradelli chocolate, so Bob... make the chips in these cookies out of the Ghiradelli too and you'd really have something.

review/text: I was told to minimize my gluten intake, so I bought this cookie mix but with very low expectations for how they would taste.  They are YUMMY though!  The mix calls for margarine, but I used butter.  The next time I make them I might add in some more mini chips, but they really are delicious as is.  I think they were even better the day after I made them -- they have a rich texture which was almost like a peanut butter cookie.  I think even people who don't restrict their wheat/gluten intake would really like these.

review/summary: Variable results, great to YUCKY - Quality control issues???
review/text: So, I made these cookies a few weeks ago and they were really good.  In fact, I got an upset stomach from eating so much dough and only ended up with a few fabulous cookies.  So I bought some more.  I smelled the beans as soon as I opened the package, that beaney smell that some GF flours have, and while I didn't remember that from last time I figured it would go away when mixed and cooked.  So I mixed in the rest of the ingredients, and the smell got a bit worse, and the texture seemed all wrong.  I tasted the dough (you must be thinking that I'm an idiot by now doing this, but I really wanted some cookies to go with today's snowstorm!), and YUCK.  5 minutes later I still have a bad, metallic taste in my mouth.  Seriously, like these are contaminated with metals or something.  I am going to throw away the cookies that are baking.  They look all wrong... like meringue, not like chocolate chip cookies, nothing like the batch two weeks ago.  It's really weird.  Two completely different experiences with the same product in less than a month.  This batch of cookies is a failure of 4 of 5 senses: smell, sight, taste, and texture.  I'm glad I can't hear cookies.  There are some serious quality control issues here, that are probably the root of the range of opinions in these ratings.  I think I need to contact Bob.  Too bad for him I didn't review this product two weeks ago.

I personally like a very chewy chocolate-y cookie and this was not that.  However, I played with the recipe and my non-GF family and friends like these now as well.  To the mix, I add TWO sticks of butter, TWO eggs (instead of the one each the bag recipe calls for), 1/3 cup of cocoa and more chocolate chips.  I cook them at the same temp for the same length of time and they come out great.

review/text: I bought these for my mother-in-law as a special treat for her on Mother's Day. She cannot have gluten in her diet and that makes meals for family get-togethers difficult to plan-- especially when it comes to desserts. I mixed up a batch (using real butter instead of margarine) and was a little worried when the batter stayed dry and just looked like loose crumbs in the bowl. But like the package says, it sticks into balls when you press together in your hands. I also have to admit that I tasted the raw batter ( I can't resist!) and it tasted funny, so again I was worried. When they came out of the oven they looked a little dry (worried again) but when they cooled off and I tasted them I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor. My mother-in-law will definitely be pleased.

review/text: I have to say "WOW!" to Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix. My order just came in today and we couldn't wait to try them. My son has been put on a gluten-free diet for his allergies so we thought our world had been turned upside down. Since we had been so happy with Bob's Red Mill GF Wonderful Bread Mix, we decided to try this cookie mix. As I was mixing the ingredients it just didn't look right (compared to a regular gluten cookie mix) and the batter tasted very strange. But once they were cooked I couldn't believe how delicious they were! So I guess the moral to the story is "don't judge a cookie by its batter" -- heehee! This mix will certainly be a new favorite for both the gluten-free and gluten eaters in our home! And boy am I glad we ordered 4 of these from Amazon--I have a feeling we'll be making more this weekend. Heehee!

review/text: Surely there is an egg hiding in there somewhere, right?<br /><br />And heaping cups of wheat flour? Yeah? ....no??...wait. WHAT?<br /><br />These cookies! I have been gluten-free, dairy-free, and egg-free for a year now after finding out I'm allergic to basically everything on earth, and I hadn't allowed myself to try these yet because I'm also watching out for too much sugar. But I gave them a shot last night and I swear to you, I ate four. FOUR, bing bing bing bing. I was just going to eat one, maybe two. Then I was like okay one more. Okay ooooone more. (I didn't make them as large as the package I don't think, but honestly I don't care. I have no shame, I ate four cookies.)<br /><br />And each one was so delicious. They were chewy in the center, crispy on the outside. No disgusting aftertaste (I read some of the other lower reviews and can't figure out where that was coming from. Maybe it was a few years ago and they've since improved the mix?), no gritty or beany texture...I kept going back and re-reading the ingredients and looking at the packaging to make sure I wasn't completely delusional. Had I bought a non-gluten-free mix? This couldn't be this delicious, it just couldn't.<br /><br />My husband is not gluten free and he was flipping out about how good they were. I didn't even use an egg! I used the Ener-G egg replacer, and there was such a lovely chewiness and richness to these cookies. I was sure they'd be crumbly and gross as I was forming the dough together. I was afraid they'd taste weird, or be gritty and unappetizing like store-bought gluten free 'cookies' that I've tried (I've just given up trying new brands at this point).<br /><br />I could weep at how happy I am to have found this cookie mix. A true treat amidst repetitive failures this whole year trying to find great gluten-free alternatives. Bob's Red Mill, keep rocking on with your bad selves.

I hoped that the cookies would be good after being baked, but boy was I wrong. They were so bad I couldn't even eat a whole cookie, honestly! If you gluten-free folks haven't yet found the perfect gluten-free cookie, check out the line of cookie mixes from Colie's Cookies ([...]). It's a new business and the products are only available online. I tried the sample pack consisting of 6 different flavors.. and all 6 were super yummy! Even my non-gluten-free friends and family said they were EXCELLENT and couldn't taste the "gluten-free" aspect! If you haven't yet tried them, you are in for a real treat!

review/summary: Really great, with some adjustments
review/text: These cookies are really great and I bake them for all my family, which is a mix of gluten-intolerant and intolerant of gluten free. And they ALL love them. But I made a number of adjustments to the mix instructions to make them great.<br /><br />The instructions call for 1/2 cup (or 8 tablespoons) Margarine (cold) which gives you a mix that is the texture of wet sand, not so good for cookies. And a pain to pat and form into something that looks like a cookie but keeps falling apart.  I almost double the margarine, I put 13-14 tablespoons of margarine. More or less depending on how the dough looks.  This gives you a cookie dough texture that is just right for scooping.  I also add a shake or two of cinnamon (chocolate and cinnamon YUM!), a teaspoon of vanilla, more chocolate chips (I like the enjoy life, soy free, dairy free ones) and walnuts or pecans (optional).<br /><br />Now here's another very important new step.  I make the dough and then I wrap it in parchment paper/plastic baggie and leave it in the fridge for at least 5 hours of even overnight, or freeze it for another time.  Somehow this step really makes a difference in taste and texture of the baked cookie.  Then scoop it up and bake as normal.<br /><br />I know it seems like a lot extra to do but when you have to stay GF in a G world you find ways to make things work.  I make adjustments to just about all the mixes I buy. And these cookies (with my tweaks) have a great, look, taste and texture.

review/summary: Ewwww! Low on chocolate, high in bland/bean flavor
review/text: I love the Betty Crocker chocolate chip cookie mix, but I can't have it anymore due to the milk in it. I also tend to like Bob's Red Mill products. I was excited to see this was a mix I could have. Despite other reviewer's advice to not try the dough, I did. It tastes just like a bean. I decided to add some vanilla and a little brown sugar. I tried the dough again, EW! Still awful. Unfortunately I was out of my allergy-friendly chocolate chips because this mix desperately needed some more chocolate chips! I cooked them hoping the flavor would improve. Taking other reviewer's advice, I cooked them a little long because the reviews said that is what makes the bean flavor go away. (Why not just use beans to begin with Bob's Red Mill??) I just ate a warm cookie, and while it wasn't so "beany" anymore, it wasn't good. They are very bland.

review/text: I made these cookies today for my daughter who has a gluten allergy and the rest of my family.  The kids were so excited to try these and boy...were we disappointed!  The substitute for flour in this mixture is garbanzo bean flour.  Really?  There are so many flour alternatives on the market and they put beans in this recipe.  And the dough really does have a bean aftertaste.  It starts off sweet and then the lasting effect is garbazo beans.  Not what I want in a cookie.  To make them better, we added more vanilla and then rolled the cookie dough in sugar.  It was the only way to cut the bean flavoring. Also I think they only add 25 chips so be sure and add more to your own recipe.  Betty Crocker's gluten free version is so much better!

review/summary: Great cookies!
review/text: We have made these twice now for my son who has several severe food allergies. He loves them! They did turn out different both times, but then both times were good so we didn't mind (my husband, who has no food allergies, eats just as many of them as my son). First time they were puffy and soft and never really 'settled' while cooking but tasted great. Second time they looked just like a stiff store-bought cookie and were crispy on the edges while gooey in the middle. The dough also looked different the each time - dry but combined well the first, and almost sticky the second. It seems there may be some kind of consistency issue but so far that has no hurt the quality or taste at all and we've been very pleased with this mix.<br /><br />Note: We made the cookies each time with Ener-G egg replacer.<br /><br />And yes, the dough smells awful but that hasn't hurt the taste of the cookies in the end!

review/summary: great cookie mix
review/text: A wonderful alternative if you are going gluten-free. Cookies bake up just like in the description, but I bake them 4 minutes longer for a really crispy cookie. This also helps tame the bean-like texture. I don't have a problem with gluten, but have been slowly ridding it from my diet, and this is a quick, easy and delicious way to enjoy cookies without the gluten.

review/summary: Gluten free choc chip cookies
review/text: My son was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease. So now were on a quest to find good alternatives to wheat products. A hard job at that. Just baked these cookies today. Be warned DO NOT TASTE THE DOUGH. It tastes awful. Also, do not bake these cookies to be soft. They need to be baked through. You'll understand if you taste the dough. He's nine he'll eat just about anything if it's sweet. I will be trying other brands in the future with 5 stars and better comments.

review/summary: So yummy and so easy!!
review/text: My son is allergic to wheat, dairy, eggs, soy, rice, and oats (plus more). It is nearly impossible to find cookies he can eat as almost all wheat free cookie recipes call for rice flour or oats. We were hesitant to try these because the Bob's wheat free brownies are pretty bad, but I'm SO glad we did! These were delicious and free of all of my son's allergens (the chocolate chips contain soy lecithin but his allergist said that does not contain enough soy protein to cause a reaction)! Not to mention so easy to make! It has directions for substituting the egg right on the package, and we used Earth Balance Soy Free Buttery Spread instead of butter. I did have to cook them for about 21 minutes instead of just 15 as the package states, but they outside is nice and crisp while the middles are still soft and delicious. I will definitely be buying this mix again!!

review/summary: A Good Buy With Some Additional ingredients
review/text: I just got finished baking these cookies. I tasted a chocolate chip before the bake and it tasted like no chocolate chip I have had before so that made me skeptical. They baked nice and round, had a good chewy consistency, and tasted just okay.<br /><br />I will do what others suggested and with the rest of my batch in the fridge, add the brown sugar and additional chocolate chips...I might even add the Andy's bits just to give it an additional minty kick. I think that will do it.

review/summary: Loved them!
review/text: We've been gluten free for awhile and I've experimented with different mixes and making from scratch.  Everyone has their own definition of the "perfect" chocolate cookie, this one is pretty close to mine.<br /><br />I absolutely love them.  They were chewy, had a nice rise to them, and the finished cookie tasted great.  As other reviewers have said, there aren't a lot of chocolate chips in them, so you could always add your own.<br /><br />The dough does feel differently, but when you start in gluten free baking, you have to get over the expectation that recipes will mix up the same as the ones with regular flour.  I did smell and taste the fava bean in the dough, but once they were baked I couldn't at all.  I don't think someone could tell these were gluten free at all if I didn't tell them.

review/summary: OK if you don't mind the bean-flavor
review/text: These cookies are easy to make, and maintain a nice shape during baking.  However, the flavor is not so great.  Gluten-free baking has come a long way in the last few years, and you can find good recipes and mixes that don't involve bean flours.  The bean flour flavor is pervasive and lingers in your mouth long after you eat the cookie.  Since we gluten-free eaters are sometimes desperate for baked goods, we tend to overlook slightly off flavors, but this was too much for me.  I will not buy the mix again.

review/summary: first time trying, wont be last!
review/text: I made these for my sister in law who has a mild/medium gluten sensitivity who was staying with us.for the weekend. As a person who typically eats gluten, I was impressed.<br /><br />First I made the amendment of adding an additional egg and stick of butter. The butter I use is Smart Butter blend. An additional half cup of chocolate chips. Also I let the dough rest in the fridge for about a half hour.<br /><br />It was very sticky, and my husband taste tested the dough said it was 'iron' like in taste. We baked for 15 minutes and let them cool a bit before eating. Everyone liked them and said the taste was 'normal'. Texture is different, more grainy, and they fall a little flat but that didn't matter to me. The next morning I ate one and it had a slight banana flavor. I had my coworkers try them and said the same about banana and thought they were decent without having known they were gluten free until after trying.<br /><br />Since I only made a few cookies I left the dough in the fridge overnight. The current batch I'm making rose up quit a bit more. They handled a little better too. My only complaint is the need to have 2 sticks of butter in relation to fat content.

review/text: We recently chose to go GF to help clear up our daughter's eczema.  She was a little bummed, thinking she would not be able to enjoy freshly baked cookies anymore.  I picked up a pack of this mix at Whole Foods, and WOW!  These are very good.  I did modify the recipe a little bit, and added 1 tbs. organic canola oil, and about a 1/3 cup organic smooth peanut butter.  I think the extra oil and the peanut butter helped to make the cookies more doughy and less crumbly.  They are so good, we can't stop eating them!!

review/text: Like another reviewer, we tried the brownies first and were in heaven, so we assumed the chocolate chip cookies would be just as good.  Boy were we wrong!  I had to add tons of vanilla to the dough to get rid of the bitter taste, but even that just slightly masked it.  Once they baked up they tasted better but they were still a far cry from a good chocolate chip cookie.  They can hardly be called chocolate chip cookies with how little "chocolate" is in them (carob).  Don't waste your time with this mix and make Alton Brown's gluten free cc cookies instead! [...]

With the butter, and more chocolate chips these taste exactly like the classic tollhouse cookies I used to make.

review/summary: Not So Great for Other Types of Restricted Diets
review/text: Honestly, I'm more than a little surprised by other reviewers who say these cookies taste "just like regular" chocolate chip cookies. I don't know what cookies they were eating before but these in NO WAY taste or look like the homemade ones I make, nor did I expect them to.<br /><br />They are very easy to mix up but the dough is odd both in taste and in texture. After mixing, it appears quite crumbly but if you smoosh it together it will form a ball and then can be placed on cookie sheets. The taste of the dough has this....well, quite frankly yucky after-taste but thankfully that mostly goes away after they are baked.<br /><br />I got these mixes for my husband who was diagnosed with type II diabetes because some of the other gluten free products we'd tried were diabetic friendly but after reading the label found that not to be the case. In fact, if you are on any other kind of restricted diet, you should read the label before buying. Per every 2 cookies there is 180mg of sodium, 24g of sugar and 41g of carbs. Had I seen the label prior to buying, I would have passed. My bad.<br /><br />Bottom line: If I were gluten sensitive/intolerant, I would be thanking the God's above for these but since I'm not, I can't really say they are as good as regular cookies and if like me, you are thinking these will fill the bill as a healthier alternative if you are on a restricted diet of some other kind then the answer to that is no and they don't claim to be. I just want to save someone else from making the same assumptions I misguidedly made and is in NO WAY the fault of the maker but just my own mistake.<br /><br />I didn't give them 3 stars because they don't fit in with the diabetic diet but because they just didn't taste that good to me, my husband or either of my parents. Not horrible, just not what I would describe as "tasty".

My five year old son says he wants me to put in the review that these cookies make "super horrible cookies and dough". I bake all the time and have made many gluten free desserts.  I like the Bob's Red Mill brownies but these cookies have a horrible aftertaste that does not go away after they are cooked as one reviewer stated. In fact, after making the first batch and reading the glowing reviews here I bought another bag and made them again because I figured I must have had a bad bag but the second bag was just as bad.  We threw the cookies and the rest of the dough away after tasting them. I made some other chocolate chip cookies with the Gluten Free Pantry all purpose flour (using a regular recipe)and they tasted much better.

review/summary: The Finest, Strongest Aroma, Best flavor, Longest Lasting Bag Chai Tea!
review/text: Just read the title, seriously. I am a tea junkie and love my Chai. After purchasing many from the local supermarkets and whole foods. I was sold on Stash brand for the powerfully good aroma and flavor they seem to provide in their teas. If you like very watery tea you may not like this Chai as much as I do. For me, one tea bag makes a quart of good tea!

review/summary: A worthy and welcome replacement
review/text: I don't know what has happened to formulation or processing of the "big name" Earl Grey teas in the past several years, but the quality of those had degraded to such an extent that I went looking for a replacement. I am happy to say that I have found it in spades in this brand!  The bergamot comes through not only in the aroma but also the taste. (I also really like the color of the box!) This company also makes a "double bergamot" Earl Grey but I actually prefer the regular (this one) to the double. If you have become unhappy with your current Earl Grey, I recommend that you give this one a try.

review/summary: Perhaps Brewing Wrong?
review/text: I find that most (not all) people in North America brew their tea for too long a period.  When I first visited China I was amazed at how quickly after pouring the boiling water into the pot, they poured out the "finished" tea.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Keurig machine and have it perfect for making this tea.  I only drink it iced, perhaps that is the difference?  Two bags in the permanent filters and run through twice (using the large cup setting).  Poured over ice with a bit of milk.  I use Stevia for my sweetener.<br /><br />No bitterness.  Just perfectly brewed aromatic Chai Tea.  With the double spice, it gives my tastebuds the perfect "kick" that I desire.

review/summary: This chai tastes very good but should include more black tea leaves.
review/text: This chai has good flavor but needs more black tea leaves to make a fully satisfying cup of tea. It leans on cloves but not overly, to my taste. The Tazo chai has more tea leaves and tastes very good if used properly -- 2 mugs of tea or an extra large mug from each tea bag. I've gotten used to the Stash spicing now (have enjoyed 6 boxes) and like to drink both the Stash and the Tazo (also finished 6 boxes), which I drink straight, in succession, in the morning. Then I switch to decaf Tazo chai which is very good and makes 2 mugs per tea bag.

review/summary: Stash tea can vary batch to batch
review/text: I have, in the past, positively reviewed other Stash flavors, Ginger Lemon and Holiday Chai.  Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once, but then a second shipment was excellent.  But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices.

review/summary: Best of the Earl Grey teas
review/text: A classic tea, great by itself or with a large chocolate brownie drenched in dark chocolate syrup. Earl Grey seems to be a difficult tea to blend properly: without the proper proportion and quality of bergamot, the tea is either astringent or overly flowery. In my opinion, Stash gets the blend just right with their standard Earl Grey (the decaf version is also terrific, but to my taste the double bergamot drowns the tea flavor). I've tried several other brands, and can hardly drink the others. Don't say you dislike Earl Grey before trying this blend!

After trying Twinings, Bigelow and a few others, I discovered Stash and found it to have a fresher, cleaner taste with a more pronounced bergamot fragrance. It costs slightly more than the others but seems well worth it to me. Also, buying it in quantity through Amazon brings the cost down significantly as compared to local grocery chains.

review/summary: stash peach
review/text: I fell in love with Stash Peach Tea in about 2005 when I had it at the Hobnob Tea Room in Loveland CO. Not only can you select it for your lunch but you can buy a box from the stock they keep on hand. Because it's a family owned restaurant (not a chain) naturally they have to charge enough to pay for s/h. I found it a little cheaper at Vitamin Cottage. I always had a big cup after lunch at my desk at the post office where I worked in the passport office. Every time customers or other clerks would come in they would say "wow what smells so delicious?". It began to happen that I would make a trip to Hobnob or Vit Cott and they would be out of my tea. That flavor does not seem to be carried even in stores that carry Stash. So I found it by accident on Amazon while looking for something else entirely. I was so happy. If I purchase enough at a time it saves me nearly a dollar a box over all. I drink it every day so VOILA I found a great deal on Amazon. Thank you!!!

review/summary: Earl Grey of Earl Grey +++
review/text: I already liked regular Stash Earl Grey and so dared to try this doubled bergamot variant. This Earl Grey variant is the best I have tried out of many. There may be ones stronger in both aspects of the black tea and bergamot or more balanced -- but I only know that this "Double Bergamot Earl Grey" is a very balanced rich black tea with bergamot -- and it is organic like other Stash teas. This doubled bergamot Earl Grey is great hot with milk and brown sugar -- or icy with just a tad lemon or lime to add to the bergamot -- or without such additions. Also it is so rich someone can add it to other plain, even modest, black tea [bags one-for-one] for a more mellow bergamot tea. I even found it interesting with black mint tea [bags one-for-one] as this variant is not overwhelmed by other teas +++

review/text: I was introduced to Stash a few years ago when I sampled their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG89Y">peppermint tea</a>, which was so powerful you could smell it through the packaging. It was so delicious I decided to get a box of each of their tea samplers, including black.<br /><br />Now I have another Stash favorite. After running out while on vacation I had to try a number of different Earl Grey teas (Bigelow, Twinings, Generic Grocery Store brand), and though adequate, they lacked the extra bergamot kick I'd grown to love. With Stash you get a fragrant, excellent quality tea, and they know how to package it for freshness.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite morning hot drinks when I want to start my day with a nice jolt. And if you have a sweet tooth like me, serve hot with sweetened condensed milk.

review/summary: Tasty Tea
review/text: I used to spend a fortune on good Chai Tea at the coffee shop.  Then, I discovered the double-spice tea.  We both loved the stronger flavor of the spices.  To my dismay, on my next trip to the grocery store, the double-spice tea was nowhere to be found!  It was one of those items that apparently wasn't on their regular ordering schedule.  I looked it up on Amazon, and, there it was...six boxes at a time, on subscribe and save, a decent price, and quick delivery!  This tea is great with a "sweetener of choice" (I generally use stevia or agave in mine) and some milk or cream, hot or cold.  My hubbie drinks it with no additions at all and it is his "pre-sleep" tea of choice.  I've also used 5-7 bags in my iced tea maker and the result is yummy iced tea (or, add just a bag of this tea to regular tea for a hint of spice).  Stash teas are great overall.  I like the fact that they are individually wrapped in a "foil" wrap that holds together well and can be taken to the office or wherever without dissolving in one's pocket or purse!  It IS black tea and contains caffeine!  If this is a problem, try the Good Earth Original Caffeine-Free tea.  Also available on Amazaon, it is a delicious, slightly sweet, cinnamon-y tea!

review/text: I have been a tea drinker all my life, and Stash has some wonderful flavors! I think I got primarily hooked on the finer teas when my parents drove us to Canada as children every year.  I primarily drink Earl Gray teas because they are a deep rich teas, but not overpowering.  When you drink Earl Gray, you feel like you drank a fine cup of English tea.  The Double Bergamot added to the Earl Gray is even more superior!  Bergamot is also relaxing.  This is a wonderful blend and very difficult to find in stores.

review/summary: Too much cinnamon!
review/text: This cinnamon flavor in this tea is overwhelming. It really hides any tea taste. Would not buy it again.

review/summary: Gets me out of bed in the morning!
review/text: What can get me out of a cat-warmed bed on a chilly morning?  A pot of Stash Double Spice Chai tea.  The spices are enticing and warm up you up down to your toes.  I find the best way to drink it is with a splash of vanilla soy milk in the bottom of the mug, then pour in the tea.  The vanilla soy adds just enough sweetness to counteract the bitterness of the tea (I like to brew it strong), but not so sweet that it overpowers the spices.  Yum!

review/summary: Ahhh finally truly spicy chai in a tea bag
review/text: I once had a soy chai latte that blew my mind. I was driving through Missoula Montana. I have yearned for years to capture that taste again. I have tried chai after chai with no luck. This chai comes close. If you like spicey chai but without all the sugar and milk in the premixed, this may be your chai.

review/text: Stash is the best on the market as far as I am concerned.  I have been a fan of many of their teas but the Earl grey Double Bergamot is my favorite.

review/summary: Tea Devotee from Way Back
review/text: I've never been a coffee drinker.  I've only drunk tea since I was a child.  I've always brewed my tea as strongly as I could then added half & half.  I first saw this Irish tea fairly recently and bought a box.  It is the most delicious tea I've ever drunk.  I drink it very strong with half & half and love it.  However, unlike the Irish, I can only drink it in the morning.  I heartily recommend this full-bodied, wonderfully flavored tea.  It's everything a good breakfast tea should be.
