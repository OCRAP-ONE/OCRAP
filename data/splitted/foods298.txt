review/summary: untruthful ingredients. Don't be fooled.
review/text: Unlike the ingredients listed on this website, this Good Earth Caffeine Free Sweet & Spicy tea has artificial flavor added -- and it's the third ingredient, meaning that there's more artificial flavor than all the other ingredients except for rooibos and chicory root.<br /><br />I feel ripped of by Amazon's dishonesty of listing ingredients from another, completely different product on the page describing this artificially flavored tea.<br /><br />Even worse, I received this rubbish as part of my Subscribe and Save subscription. They replaced my original subscribed product, which wasn't artificially flavored, with this junk, and didn't have the balls to mention the COMPLETELY DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE.

review/summary: Stimulating Even Without Caffeine
review/text: This tea is probably my very favorite tasting tea ever! It is delicious hot or cold, and has a sweetness all its own so it does not need added sweetener.<br /><br />So why only 3 stars?? Because I have discovered that, for me and some others I know, panax ginseng is a major stimulant. Knowing that it is caffeine free I had a small glass of this tea iced one evening. That night I barely slept a wink. At first I didn't make the connection, but then I remembered that my husband has the same reaction to ginseng (and he's a person who can drink full-caf coffee at night and have no trouble sleeping).<br /><br />I now drink it only before noon, and that seems to be okay. Ginseng may not be stimulating to everyone, but I just wanted to mention it for those who may be like me.<br /><br />I notice that Good Earth's *Organic* Original does not have ginseng listed in the ingredients, so that may be a viable alternative.

review/summary: Best Tea ever
review/text: I am not a tea person, I dont drink coffee either.  I do drink juice and soda, etc.  The reason I have never really liked tea is that most dont have enough flavor for me.  Most tea to me taste like you made a drink and then devoted it by 100 to 1.  This tea has a very powerful flavor which can always be thinned down with more water but is not needed. I have had plenty of people try this tea around my office and they all love it. My wife has switched from her tea's to only drinking this one.

review/summary: A spicy, sweet, strong blend... good anytime!
review/text: I normally only drink tea when I'm sick. This tea is the exception! There's nothing like it. I drink it whenever and gladly serve it to guests.<br /><br />Back in the late 70's and 80's I always enjoyed this tea at Good Earth Restaurants in California, which was their signature drink, served hot or iced. The tea is obviously one of the only things that remains from that restaurant.<br /><br />The tea is incredibly sweet, needing no sugar or sweetener and it's strong enough that two bags can easily make a carafe of 4-5 cups. You can find it in supermarkets in California, but not in Florida. I have it delivered to Florida then bring it back with me to Germany.  It's great that I can order it in quantity from Amazon. I buy more than I need because I like to give boxes of the tea as gifts. Now I've got more than a few friends hooked!

review/text: NEW<br />Updated 1-6-2012Yes I to received a shipment from Amazon on this tea and had the same problem stating no artificial flavors and then the new box says on the front natural and artificial flavors. I called Amazon and they refunded me and were suppose to correct this. Still they have not. The company still makes this tea as before with no artificial flavors, caffiene free although a new box. If they would call the company as I did then Amazon is selling the wrong box listed and pictured. I have called Amazon who said they would fix this but has not. Amazon needs to correct this problem.<br /><br />BEFORE<br />Wow if you love a good tea that is flavorful and sweet. This is the tea to enjoy. Went on vacation and happened to find this tea that has no caffeine. Tried it and a real pleasure to drink. I do have mine with soy milk. Its like having a latte. I was glad to find another tea that I can enjoy for years to come and to find this at Amazon was a plus!

review/summary: Good Earth..Great Tea
review/text: This is a very tasty spice blend, that needs no augmentation (sugar etc).<br />It's a 'spiced' blend but quite nice. It's caffeine free, so it won't keep anyone up at nights, but also feels FULL BODIED so it's a good breakfast tea for those of you trying to break the 'habit'. Try it at your local store first, then buy in bulk, 6 packs, (you'll be surprized at how quickly it goes). Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: Caffeine free and delicious!
review/text: I first found this tea when I was pregnant and on a desperate hunt for something decaffeinated but hot to drink.  Thank goodness I found this at Trader Joe's and tried it! They've since stopped carrying it so I'm thrilled to see it here<br /><br />The flavor is actually as described: sweet and spicy.  I don't have a big sweet tooth anyway but I don't like a bland tea.  This has inherent sweetness and I don't need to put sugar in it.  My husband, who won't drink anything not sweetened actually finds the undercurrent of sweetness to be enough for him too so it's a great way to get him off sugar!<br /><br />The spiciness isn't overwhelming as long as you don't let it steep too long.  I find 2-3 minutes to be enough for a 6-8 oz mug.  I love it iced too in the summer.  Can't say enough good things!

review/text: I'm not a tea connoisseur, but this tea is the best tea I've ever tasted! A friend of mine got me hooked on it and since we can't get it in the stores where I live now, I had her send me a box. I'm glad to find that I can order it online! I think the best way to describe the flavor of this tea is that it tastes like Big Red gum (cinnamon gum). It is super sweet when left to steep very long. Usually I put honey in my herbal tea to sweeten it a bit, but this tea is PLENTY sweet without any honey. Also, it has a spicy, hot bite that can tingle your tongue just like Big Red gum. It's SO yummy that everyone I've ever shared it with has to know where they can get some, too!

review/text: We LOVE this tea!!!<br /><br />It is wonderful to heat a cup of it for a spicy comfort on a cold night.  And it is also wonderful as a cool sweet treat (but without the sugar or calories) on a hot day.<br /><br />It does however have a stronger flavor than some might be wanting.  This is my case for the iced version.  So, I make a big pitcher of tea using 5 bags of this spiced tea along with 4 bags of a natural decaf green tea.  This makes a WONDERFULLY refreshing blend that is perfectly spiced without being over the top.<br /><br />Try it!!!

review/summary: A little lacking
review/text: I love sunflower seeds, chocolate, and cherries, so you can imagine my delight when I found these Chocolate Cherry Sunflower Seeds available on Amazon.  When the packet arrived, I tore it open and downed the entire contents into my eager mouth, expecting an explosion of chocolate-cherry-sunflowery sapidity.  Instead, I got a mouthful of hard shells.  I crunched through the tough, outer hulls, wondering at the inventiveness of the manufacturers who had somehow injected chocolate and cherry flavors into hard, unopened shells, but then as I macerated both hull and softer kernel into a splintery mash, found that the chocolate and cherry flavors had somehow gone missing.<br /><br />When my wife came home, I mentioned to her how I was ripped off by the Chocolate Cherry Sunflower Seeds which lacked both chocolate and cherry flavors and, in fact, were barely edible.  My wife picked up the empty packet, looked at it for a moment, and then hit me over the head with a dining room chair.  "You idiot," she said, "these seeds are for planting."  She then clobbered me with an antique, oak coat tree.  "I don't know why I ever married you," she continued, "you are always doing stupid, embarrassing things, and no matter how hard I hit you, you never learn."  She then whacked me with the coffee table for emphasis.<br /><br />Maybe I had gotten a bad batch of seeds.  I think I will order them again, and the next time, the manufacturers had better not forget the chocolate and cherry flavors, or someone is going to get a beating!

These are a nice option in addition to the regular Eden beans, which are the very best beans.  Not to mention they are BPA free.  These are very good, as are all Eden products.

review/text: I use these chili beans with a can of Eden's pinto beans and a can of organic corn, tomatoes and finally a couple of small cans of jalpeno peppers to give the whole meal a lift ( fo course all purchased through Amazon.com subscribe and save).  I saute onions, celery, carrots and then add ground turkey before I add the canned goods but the end result is successful.  I have tried this dish on my neighbor (who so kindly blows my snow) and on my two grandsons.  They all requested more so that is how I determine that success.  To make it even better you can add a layer of cornbread on top as well as insert a piece of cheese in the middle and bake until the cornbread is done.  Its a real winner.

review/summary: Wheat/Gluten made beans inedible
review/text: Why on Earth Eden felt it necessary to include wheat flour is beyond me; I've never met a can of beans that had flour in it before. When I read the Amazon description (kidney beans cooked in spices, japaleno etc.) there was no mention of flour. When the cans arrived...there it is at the bottom of the label -- wheat flour. I have celiac and I am unable to eat these beans. Very disappointed that wheat flour was not mentioned on the product page as it is such an unusual addition.

review/text: Another great addition for your food storage by Eden organic. I've found these chili beans to be the most filling I've ever had. Perfect for making batches of chili in a crock pot mixed with veggies, onions, peppers, etc. I would have given 5 stars if there were more jalepenos in the cans. I also like Edens spanish and mexican rice and beans. They all have excellent flavor while providing the body with a good amount of sustenance. For anyone concerned with price inflation now is a good time to stock up on clean organic bpa free rice and bean canned foods while you can.

review/summary: Not that great at all
review/text: I bought this tea as a gift for someone who had it at a tea and liked it. Since it came in six canisters, they gave me one.<br /><br />I was expecting white tea. This is not a white tea. It is not a good Ceylon tea either. It is easily overpowered anything you add to it. The tea tastes like water with a very sight hint of pomegranate. Even though the tea liquor is very dark, no flavor. This is advertised as a white tea but it isn't. When you brew a decent white tea, no matter how much tea you use, it still stays light and has a grassy, nutty taste. This is a Ceylon but not in the English Breakfast sense because it did not have enough edge like a good Ceylon or Assam have.<br /><br />When brewing it, I brewed it like a white tea. 160 degree water. It turned dark brown immediately so i knew it wasn't a white tea. The next time i made it i brewed it like a straight up black tea. No flavor. Tried two bags. Still not great. Watery with a very, very sight hint of a fruity taste in an 8oz cup.<br /><br />It comes in a round canister like Republic of Teas but inside is a vacuum sealed aluminum bag with all 50 of the tea bags smashed together. Inspecting the bags found very ground up tea powder. After brewing, no leaves in sight, just a lump of tea dust. I guess this is why it turned color so fast.<br /><br />I take tea with no sugar or milk. I guess if you add enough sugar, any tea can taste decent. This tea just didn't work for me on any level.<br /><br />You may want to try the Rishi or Bentleys. They are more expensive but they taste better. You may be very underwhelmed by this tea compared to them.

review/summary: Take DISCLAIMER seriously!!!!
review/text: I recently ran out of our home-prepared blend of Berbere spices, and hoping to find a fairly good blend pre-pared, I ordered this based on the list of ingredients and the fact that it's pictured in a spice container.<br /><br />Although I received my order quickly, my first disappointment was that the spice blend (I hesitate to refer to it as "Berbere") arrived in a plastic, resealable pouch. Ugh! Everyone knows that "resealable" pouches are seldom resealable after one or two openings - especially with a powdered product. I'll have to find an alternative way of storing it - perhaps when I have some other spice container that is empty.<br /><br />My greater disappointment was over the fact that the ingredient list on the package did not match the ingredient list on amazon AT ALL!!!<br /><br />The ingredients on the site are listed as including: "nutmeg, cloves, fenugreek, ginger, ajowan seeds, coriander, cumin, black pepper, allspice, cardamom, Ethiopian chili peppers..."<br /><br />The ingredients on the label of the package I received reads as follows: "cumin, paprika, New Mexico chili peppers, cayenne pepper, de arbol chili peppers, nutmeg, ancho chili peppers, Ajwan seeds, cardamom, turmeric, garlic, salt and other spices".<br /><br />I'm sure I'll get some use out of this spice blend - it should go great in chili, but it barely resembles authentic Ethiopian Berbere seasoning. I'm an amazon prime customer so was snookered into purchasing this over another product that showed up in my search b/c this one was sent w/ free shipping.<br /><br />I may order the Ethiopian Berbere seasoning (also known as "Berber Spice" from Nirmala's Kitchen here on amazon, even though I'll have to pay for shipping. For those interested, there are many other exotic spice blends and recipes available at nirmalaskitchen dot com

This is great for my family since I am not a big chip eater, but, my 8 year old son loves chips with a hot dog or a sandwich.  Now, I don't have to worry about a "big" bag of chips going stale before they are eaten, or having to buy chips every time I go to the grocery store!  They are great for school snacks and family picnics, too.  When the grandchildren or my son's freinds come over, they love them.  They can grab a bag and go outside to munch and play!  Good thing I ordered the 60 count box of Funyons, also!!!

The display of the blooming tea is not extremely attractive, but it's a novelty and the most important part is that the tea is actually good - with just the right amount of jasmine flavor that is not at all overpowering.

review/summary: Beautiful, good strength, & great iced, too!
review/text: I started drinking this tea after the same company took half the tea out of what had been my favorite teabags (their white silver needle).  These fun blooming tea balls are strong enough for more than a cup of tea.  But a tip: the little flowers that blossom on the string come off and float around in the tea the second time around.  So you either have to strain the second cup, or do what I usually do: make a small pot and get 2-3 cups of tea from each blossom.  I make the tea for myself and guests in glass mugs to take full advantage of the pretty blooms.  Although it's a bit of a waste of the decorative bloom, when I don't have plain jasmine green on hand, I also like to make iced tea from these.  The flavor has enough zip for a really refreshing change of taste.

review/summary: The budding gourmet will swoon!
review/text: This is my first experience with specialty sea salts.  I thought, salt-was-salt, unless it was infused with my favorite flavoring ingredient, truffles.  Was I ever wrong! These finishing salts are guaranteed to elevate your meal to the highest level of---well, delectable.<br /><br />We couldn't wait to put this trio to the test. On their arrival, we immediately prepared some luscious grilled steak and veggies, tasting the finished products, first without the finishing salt, then experimenting with the different salts. We were truly amazed at the degree of flavor enhancement. The flavors simply popped! And, you actually are taking in less sodium with sea salts, so there is an added health benefit.<br /><br />This trio would make the ultimate holiday gift, or anytime hostess gift.  And, purchasing all three at once is a great opportunity to experiment and identify your favorite.  These are not small trial sized containers, either.  You will receive generous portions of each salt, and since such a small amount is required, I can see them lasting quite some time. You also needn't fear breakage, or spilling during delivery.  They were packaged carefully, and the containers are not glass.<br /><br />I found it fascinating to research each salt---the locations of origin, the harvesting and the mineral contents. This certainly would be an intellectual conversation starter, for any table with those unfamiliar. There are also endless recipes to be found spotlighting the product for guests---like an appetizer of hot, crusty bread, drizzled with olive oil, grated fresh Parmesan, and the Black Lava Salt. I've not tried that yet, but I sure will.<br /><br />The Fleur de Sel is a hand harvested product from France.  It is recommended for grilled fish, salads and crusty bread.  The Black Lava Salt is a product of Hawaii, recommended for sushi, grilled chicken, fish and steak.  And finally, the Alaea Sea Salt, also a product of Hawaii, is excellent on salads and grilled steaks (it certainly was on ours).<br /><br />Treat yourself, or a budding gourmet friend.  I can't really see anyone disappointed with the experience.  I know, I'm already counting the hours until supper preparation tomorrow. Guess you can see I'm having fun, here. Isn't that what life is all about.

review/summary: An excellent product with excellent customer service
review/text: I have just placed my third order for finishing salt from Das Salt.  Ms. Das provides an excellent product that I find myself using time and again in much of my cooking.  I am far from a gourmet chef, but I do like to experiment with different spices and flavors from time to time, and her salts do often add just a bit of subtle flavor that helps just about any meal.  Finally, with my first two orders and I'm sure my third I just placed, customer service has been excellent.  Each time a card or invoice signed by Ms. Das has been included, along with a sample of another product she sells under the "Das Food" line, like some of her caramels.  Packaging is always excellent too, the jars are well protected without using excess packaging.  This is a product I fully recommend if one is looking for a gourmet finishing salt.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I love salt! In my kitchen right now I have around 10 different kinds of salts. I don't tend to use a whole lot of salt in cooking, but salt is one of the most important tools in any kitchen, and it pays to have the right tool for the job. These were my first finishing salts other than homemade smoked sea salt, and I have been very pleased with them.<br /><br />The Fleur de Sel is just the most amazing salt. Its fine texture just melts on your palate with a light taste and a mildness that makes the basic table salt that many of us are used to seem harsh in comparison. It enhances lighter foods wonderfully, and would go great with just about any dish.<br /><br />The Black Lava Salt is probably my favorite of the three. The large crystals of this salt give it a nice crunch, and the lava residue gives it a very light smoky/earthy flavor. The flavor imparted to it by the lava is very light, and isn't really something you notice right off the bat, but it is very noticeable when compared to other salts. This salt is wonderful sprinkled on top of breads before cooking. It gives a great dramatic look to homemade pretzels or bread sticks. It is also very good on most meats and vegetables.<br /><br />The Alea Sea Salt has a similar crunch and texture to the black lava salt, but in comparison it has a distinctive mineraly flavor. The flavor to it is very subtle, but adds a depth and complexity that you just don't get otherwise. I absolutely love this salt on baked chicken, fish, and most vegetables. It is the perfect finishing touch to give your dish that extra pop.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned about the small packages these come in. I don't use a lot of salt, but 6 ounces doesn't seem like very much. The thing I hadn't considered is that this isn't something I use every day, and when I do it's not the hefty four fingered pinch I would use in pasta water. I really only use a small pinch at a time to enhance flavors, so this salt has lasted quite a while for me; certainly longer than I first expected.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned that this salt seems a little damp, and if you look at the customer photos above, you can see that it is. It does have a very small amount of moisture in it, but it's not enough to cause clumping. In fact, other than appearance in the container you would never even notice it at all. Specialty salts like this are just that way. That's normal.<br /><br />All in all, I have been very pleased with these salts, and when I run out I will certainly buy the same product again.

These just taste so yummy, very different from one another - salt isn't JUST salt! The Black Lava salt was the saltiest in my opinion, but it was oh so very yummy in very small doses! I highly recommend just getting the entire set, it's well worth the time to try something new!

review/summary: Wonderful addition that makes meals special!
review/text: I ordered these after noticing the difference in the taste of foods I prepared using sea salt. The difference is rather subtle. The sea salt has a mellower taste, not as strong, but more flavorful. I had also tasted salted caramels that had black salt and pink Himilayan salt on them, and was interested in the contrast of the salt with the sweetness of the candy. I tried the black salt on filet mignon, sprinkling it on lightly just before serving. My husband was a little skeptical about trying "gourmet" salts, but he was very impressed by the difference using the black salt made in the taste of the steak. We don't normally add a lot of salt after cooking food and we don't use a lot of salt during cooking anyway, at least not as compared to many people we know, so now when I plan to use the salt from Das Foods, we use even less salt during cooking and then sprinkle on a little of one of these salts just before serving.  This is a fun way to add a little something special to your cooking.

I recommend Das Salt and will buy from them again. The only reason it doesn't rate 5 stars is because of price.

When giving a gift I want it too look as nice as possible considering how much I spent on it.  Next time I will just go to TJ Maxx and hand select one of their many nice quality gourmet items, many for less.

Wider noodles or the large flakes are easier to cook properly it seems. They go ok with tomato based sauces as well. Over all, a pretty good product.

review/text: I love these rice noodles. I make pad thai all the time, now that I can get them for so cheap on Amazon. I do live at high altitude, so I have to cover the pan on the stove after I put the noodles in, and let it sit for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. If I don't cover the pan, the noodles never soften.

review/text: Annie Chun's Pad Thai Noodles are versatile. They cook quickly and well. When I've made my own pad thai,they've proved useful. They have a good neutral flavor,and soak in sauces easily. They're also durable,and hold up good in stir frying. Annie Chun's Pad Thai Noodles are a must for Asian cooking! ESPECIALLY stir fries!
