review/summary: So Satisfying
review/text: These peanut butter bars are my latest addiction.  I actually don't usually like bars, but I started eating these to slim down post babies.  I eat half for breakfast with an espresso and have the other half for an afternoon snack.  While I don't feel stuffed/full after eating half, I am satisfied and can make it 3+ hours to my next snack or meal.  It tastes great, not too sweet like a candy bar but sweet enough to curb my afternoon cravings.  Also, the subscribe and save deal on Amazon can't be beat!

review/summary: really, they're not too bad
review/text: I typically loathe protein/nutrition bars, but these are a little different. They taste pretty good, they are low in sugar and very high in protein. I am not a fan of sweets, but sometimes I need a quick, convenient "meal" and these do the trick. I like them best with a glass of unsweetened soy milk to cut the sweet taste a little, but I can stand to eat them with just water. Considering cost, taste, and nutrition, these are some of the best protein bars I have tasted.

review/summary: Great Product but don't buy it here
review/text: These are the best protein bars that I've ever eaten.  It's a huge plus that no sugar is added and they are gluten free.  LOVE THEM.  I've purchased them twice from Amazon and was very disappointed (both times) in the condition of the product.  The chocolate looked dull and old like they had been in Grandma's freezer for too long.  Further the taste and texture were also a bit off.  My 4 and 5 year old boys love these.  They will split one before a soccer game or a mid afternoon snack. My advice is to buy them elsewhere and you will be pleased.

review/summary: Meh.  Not overly excited by this product
review/text: When I first saw the reviews for this product, I got very excited and purchased two boxes.  When I got them, I was disappointed to realize that at least part of the protein was from soy -- in general I tend to stay away from unfermented soy products -- and I found the taste rather meh.  They weren't awful but overall, I don't think I'll buy them again.

review/summary: Great Product, Great Price!! (bars are fresher than Whole Foods too!)
review/text: I'm very happy with these bars and Amazon's great price & quick shipping!!!!  I wanted a good, healthy, high protein, low glycemic, etc. meal replacement/ snack bar to eat on the go that I can keep on hand to help me reduce my caloric/ fat intake and stop me from eating unhealthy, fatty foods so I can shed a few pounds.  I went to Whole Foods and asked the employee working in the health bar area and she told me that this brand was a favorite for high protein, no sugar, and pretty good tasting.  She also told me that Chunky Peanut Butter and White Chocolate Chip were the favorite flavors.  I bought them both and liked them and saw that Amazon has them cheaper so I bought a box of each.  I was concerned when I read the reviews on here and someone said the bars were stale/ old/ not fresh, so I was prepared to send them back if need be. I checked the expiration date and they expire in a little more than a year.  I checked the wrapper of my bar from Whole foods and it expires 11 months from now.  Amazon's is fresher, go figure!!  With subscribe & save I'm saving like 60%...LOVE IT!!

review/summary: Nice protein bar when you're craving something peanuty...
review/text: I really like this thinkThin bar but was surprised when I first tried it as it's not especially crunchy...at least not crunchy like "crunchy peanut butter" crunchy. The inside of the bar is soft with pieces of crisped soy to serve as the "crunchy" bits and the outside has a thin chocolate flavor coating. The peanut butter flavor is not overpowering - just yummy - and I find the bar very filling. I could never eat two in a row! I recently ordered these from Amazon for the first time and am quite pleased with them - they arrived via USPS within a weeks time and were fresh and in perfect condition. I'll keep these tasty & satisfying bars on my Subscribe & Save schedule.

review/summary: Poor Taste (and not fresh)
review/text: Amazon clearly has stacks of these just sitting around at a warehouse for months! These bars were chalky, so they tasted old. Besides that though, I don't know how much I would've like these bars anyway. I mean I love anything peanut butter, but these bars just didn't cut it. They tasted like cardboard. Sure, the box I got was old, but I can't imagine the taste being much better when fresh. Allow me to suggest a couple of other bars that I do like, 'pure protein' bars or my favorite 'supreme protein' bars.

At 20G of protein with no sugar, they're perfect.  The taste is pretty good - while the flavor is listed as "chunky" peanut butter, it's not really that chunky or crunchy.  However, I've never had the "creamy" one to compare.

review/summary: Relaxing Zen Experience in a Tea
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Zen Green Tea with Lemongrass & Spearmint has a subtle, mild, light green tea taste, not bitter at all. I don't taste any of the additional flavors Tazo puts into this tea; maybe my palate isn't developed to this point. However, it still is one of their better teas, and has less of an artificial taste than the others I've tried. Maybe the flavorings are just too mild in this tea, but when it comes to flavorings, I prefer them this way; I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. It is not a strong green tea, so it would definitely appeal to people who enjoy herbal infusions and milder teas.<br /><br />The ingredients in Zen  are: green teas, lemon verbena, spearmint, lemongrass, and natural flavors. Zen contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "an enlightening blend of the finest green teas and rare herbs available in this world." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Zen as "smooth, lemony, earthy, refreshing". Tazo describes the aroma as "lemon, mint".  The web site also says, "Select pan-fired green tea from Zhejiang province in China, artfully combined with lemongrass, spearmint and a hint of lemon essence. Zen's distinct green tea flavor accented with lemon and mint is impossible to express in words. Best simply to experience its sweet, lingering aftertaste." I don't taste the lemon or the mint or the sweetness; still, it is a nice green tea. It is relaxing and enjoyable to drink.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Zen gets only four stars.<br />****

review/summary: My first Tazo tea
review/text: One of the most unique teas I've ever tasted. I first started drinking this tea because I wanted to start substituting green tea for coffee. So one day I ventured into my local Starbucks and order a green tea. The barista then served me up this wonderful cup of tea. Curious I read the label hanging out of the cup and began my mission to purchase some of this Zen tea. After a few misses I found a Tazo box at my local pharmacy Duane Reade (which is less of a drugstore and more of a supermarket). The tea that brewed was wonderful and flavorful, but I have to admit, I was a little disappointed. I mistakenly thought that the box of Tazo tea housed the sachets like those I had tried at Starbucks. I would later discover the `tins' (as I call them), which are sold locally at Starbucks (duh).<br /><br />In my opinion both the filter bag and the sachet taste strikingly similar. However, I still favor the sachets as they were my first experience with Tazo.<br /><br />Whoever is the Tea Master at Tazo is doing a superb job at keeping taste very consistent.<br /><br />I brew the Zen tea piping out and let it sit for a while longer than usual. I find that if I let it steep for to short I get too much lemon grass, as it takes a while for the green tea flavors to steep out. It's really an art to balance the complex flavors of this tea, yet well worth the mastery.

They are more fuller and these are more ground. Now I realize why the tin box (Tazo Zen Green Tea) at Starbucks could be twice as expensive as this (the tin box has 15 bags for $8.00 at Starbucks). If you want the rich experience of the Zen Green Tea, buy the tin box from Starbucks. And of course, 'You get what you Pay'!

It is strong with the green tea (It's not a gunpowder green like the type I enjoy best, but it's not a grassy taste which I find is often the other end of the spectrum from Gunpowder) and it is strong with spearmint taste.

review/text: This was the year I decided to break a few bad habits, one of which was drinking soda. For most of my life soda was one of my major sources of hydration, which recent studies have shown is not the healthiest of drinks even if it happens to be the diet variety.  So, I bought this tea and it has become my favorite tea.  All summer long I made a big pot, let it cool, and then refrigerated it for the next day.  I filled my Klean Kanteen with ice, poured over the green tea with lemongrass, and was good to go for the entire day.  This tea has a clean and refreshing taste.  No sugary coating of the teeth, just a delicious drink that leaves you refreshed, and possibly even with a better breath since it has some spearmint flavor too.

review/summary: Fabulous Green Tea
review/text: Tazo Zen green tea with lemongrass is an absolutely wonderful tea. The lemongrass moderates the slight bitterness that is common in plain green tea. I've experimented with adding a twist of lemongrass to a plain organic green tea, and the flavor is similar. The lemongrass complements the green tea flavor, deletes any hint of bitterness, and contributes a very faint lemon scent and flavor that can't be duplicated with ordinary lemon. I drink other green teas (for example, Tazo's decaf Lotus at night, or Tazo's jasmine when I'm in that flowery jasmine mood), but Zen is far and away my favorite. And, no, I don't own stock in the company!

review/summary: A quality product at a good price, but not what I was looking for
review/text: I was looking for an inexpensive way to get pure hibiscus tea, as I'm a big fan of it.  A pound of it at this price seemed like a good deal so I gave it a try.  Upon receiving the tea, I discovered some other ingredients in this tea, particularly orange peel and cinnamon, that overpower the hibiscus (the eponymous and most important ingredient, as far as I'm concerned) and made it more like potpourri than hibiscus tea.  Fortunately, the components are in recognizably large pieces (which I see as sign of high quality) that I can pick out the undesirable bits.<br /><br />So if you're thinking of buying, be advised that this tea has cinnamon and orange peel.  I wasn't able to find that description anywhere on the product page.

review/text: I bought this tea after hearing about reported health benefits and because herbal teas have never really worked for me and I wanted to give another go at it. This tea really blew me away with it's complex melody of flavors, lack of bitter overtones and ability to steep for a long period only making it for the better. I'm actually surprised at my response and feel fortunate to have come across this product (thanks Amazon!).

review/summary: A great hibiscus based tea!
review/text: I originally purchased Davidson's Pure Organic Hibiscus to test it's affect on my blood pressure.  Since that tea is not available at the moment, I decided to give this one a shot.<br /><br />Note that (as others have pointed out) this is not a pure hibiscus tea, and does not claim to be.  It also has orange peel, lemon myrtle, and cinnamon.  The tea IS predominantly hibiscus.  The aroma is very different from the pure tea, but the hibiscus taste and color are still very much there.<br /><br />To me, the additional ingredients compliment the hibiscus taste quite well.  I believe the ratio of hibiscus to other ingredients is spot on, and I personally have no problem drinking this tea as an alternative to pure hibiscus for blood pressure purposes.  You can always strengthen your brew!<br /><br />Just like all other Davidson's bulk items I've purchased, this is a great tea at a great price.

I've never tried hibiscus-based teas before, except as a minor ingredient, and picked some up to help with a relative's blood pressure (there's now a lot of evidence of benefit from human clinical trials) and gave it a try. Absolutely lovely! And remarkably, I even the used leaves are edible, and taste good: try mixing them up with yogurt or fat-free ricotta and a little Walden Farms Chocolate Syrup (Low-Carb) 12 oz or other sweetener.

review/summary: Intense and tasty
review/text: I purchased this as a less expensive alternative to Tazo's Passion Tea and am very pleased with it. This tea brews up with a very intense flavor and the hint of orange and cinnamon are a perfect compliment to the hibiscus.  Be forewarned that this is a very tart tea and you may need quite a bit more sweetener than you are accustomed to using.  I am still working out the exact ratios for a perfect cup, but it seems like a teaspoon (or a teaspoon and a half) to 14 oz of boiling water steeped for 5 minutes will produce a very strong brew that can been poured over ice and still remain very flavorful.  (I prefer mine iced.)  I know that sounds like a small amount of tea, but this is very concentrated and therefore a terrific value for the money.  Another great perk is that you can let it steep for as long as you like and it will not grow bitter like some other teas do.

review/summary: Three Great Reasons to Purchase
review/text: There are three great reasons to buy bulk hibiscus flowers for tea:<br />1 A cup a day reduces high blood pressure (see more below)<br />2 It tastes great, with nutrasweet and/or a few drops of apple juice<br />3 It's a cheap zero-calorie replacement for expensive juice like Cran-pom that still provides Vitamin C<br /><br />I began to look into bulk hibiscus tea when I found that my blood pressure was high and read in Mother Earth News (and other sources) that hibiscus tea could reduce high blood pressure.  It worked for me.  We make two � gallon jugs from 5 tablespoons, add nutrasweet and drink hot or warm.  It has replaced juice in our household.  There are probably 50 gallons in a 1 pound bag, so it's very cheap (about 25 cents a gallon)!  It has a citrusy floral taste.

review/text: I expected 100% hibiscus, but was very happy with my purchase and now have it on auto-delivery. I paid big bucks in the past for a blend of hibiscus tea at Teavana. This tea is just as good, if not better. Hibiscus, orange peel, and cinnamon lower high blood pressure. I add a small piece of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VVHIJ6">Needle Ku Ding Tea</a> to the mix and a dash more cinnamon when brewing. The needle ku ding has a very bitter taste so a little goes a long way. I am 100% pleased with this product and the results I have gotten with my customized blend.

review/summary: Makes a great iced tea!
review/text: I really enjoy Davidson's Te De Hibiscus for iced tea.  The brewed tea is a deep pomegranate-red color and it WILL stain, so you have to be careful not to spill it!  This tea is a good substitute for lemonade.  Why?  The taste is lemony-hibiscus-cinnamon.  The hibiscus lends quite a sour/tart flavor and the lemon myrtle gives a good lemony kick.  As such, I find that I need more sweetener with this tea than with most others (I use stevia or artificial sweetener, so this doesn't add extra calories).  Hibiscus can lower blood pressure, so don't consume too much!

review/summary: Saucy and hot for a moment or two
review/text: I purchased several assorted jars of Mrs. Renfro's Salsa products and will review them as we go through the jars.  The first one we've opened is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LG2AW0">Mrs. Renfro's Habanero Salsa Hot -- 16 oz</a> and it's better than average but not knock your socks off jarred salsa.  Initially, the sauce was very thin in consistency, but after refrigeration, it thickened a bit.  Nevertheless, this is definitely not home-made fresh type salsa, it is a jarred and prepared in large batch salsa product.  At the cost of a couple dollars at the store, we were not dissatisfied, but I wouldn't pay more for this.  There are a few mushy tomato chunks in the product, so it's not totally smooth.  The heat is intense but lasts only briefly, so if you're looking for lingering heat, I'd recommend another salsa.  For a quick jolt of habanero, this is very good and worthy of a four star review.  I'll compare it to the other Mrs. Renfro salsa products as they are tasted.

Though I am still the most devoted of Amazon customers, the prices are definitely trending upward and no longer is Amazon automatically the least expensive option. I will have to do due diligence in the future.

By purchasing the 1 lb. size, I have been able to refill my little supermarket spice jar at least four times with plenty over.  I am grateful to Wholespice not only for offering the paprika in bulk for an extremely reasonable price, but for their fast shipping.<br /><br />If you've never tried smoked paprika, please give it a try.  If you enjoy using it as much as I do, please buy it from Wholespice.  I truly believe that you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Rich Flavor, Low Calories
review/text: Lately I've been really getting into espresso, and this small espresso-based energy drink comes as close to the taste of the real thing as is possible for a drink of this kind. It's very light (only 10g of sugars, no fat, no dairy and only 50 calories), and it's very bitter as compared to some other similar beverages. For instance, the 6.5 ounce can of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BZODI">Starbucks DoubleShot</a> contains 17g of sugar, 6g of fat, and 140 calories. Even the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005W4AF3G">Starbucks Doubleshot Light</a> has 6g of sugar, 4g of fat and 70 calories. In terms of caffeine per serving, illy's espresso drink has about 155 mg as opposed to 130 for the Sturbucks drinks.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: if you want a strong, light, European-style espresso drink than illy's issimo is a great choice. However, if you enjoy smoother, more filling taste then check out the Starbucks' DoubleShots.

review/summary: illy issimo caff&egrave;
review/text: Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel. It's not as good as freshly made espresso but it's not bad at all. I do prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo cappucino</a> as a treat.

review/text: Tried this through subscribe and save so pay about $5.50 per bag shipped. Normally big Starbucks fans here and prefer the darker coffee, but we were perfectly happy with this given the price point. The flavor mixes well with our regular caffeinated coffee and is not bitter or stale tasting. Just keep in mind these are only 10oz packages so smaller than you would buy at grocery (usually 12oz) or Starbucks shop (usually 16oz). Anyhow, no complaints here.

review/summary: Yumm!  Nutella and Nestle chocolate combined in a Kit Kat!
review/text: I've always been a fan of Kit Kat bars, but was stunned at how differently the ones I tried in Europe tasted compared to the ones I've been used to here in the good old U.S. of A.  Turns out the difference is largely that the U.S. bars are made by Hershey, and the European fare is made by Nestle.  (Go figure!)<br />To each their own, but once I sampled Nestle's milk chocolate, I no longer cared for Hershey's.  So that explains why I prefer the standard U.K. version over the standard U.S. variety.<br /><br />But, these bars include another European touch called Hazelnut Cream.  To those of you familiar with Nutella, you'll immediately be able to imagine the new taste combination.  It's not an overwhelming application of Hazlenut Cream, just enough to get your attention, but man-oh-man, are these Kit Kat's good!<br /><br />Pricey as they are to get here at Amazon, it's still cheaper than a flight to England to get these, so go for it!<br /><br />Try em, you'll like em.

However, I've been using it for years as an additive to my made-from-scratch (almost) meatloaf. It is not heavily spiced, and it makes a perfect meatloaf. Also, I've never received a stale package. With the shelf life most packaged foods have these days, something would have to be really ancient to be considered stale.

review/summary: Fabulous Low Sodium Bouillon
review/text: Edward & Sons Low Sodium Veggie Bouillon is one of the best that I have tried.  There are actual tiny bits of veggies in the cubes--obviously not enough to prevent you from adding your own.  When I cook rice, I love to toss either one or two of these cubes into the rice cooker.<br /><br />One correction to the Nutritional Information posted on the product page:  The actual sodium content is 135 mg and not 920 as indicated on the product page.  This is a huge difference.<br /><br />05/31/2011 Update:<br /><br />I am saddened to say that I will not be purchasing these bouillon cubes from Amazon.  I don't know if it was a fluke but the last box that I purchased came complete with bugs.  Unfortunately, I discovered this after it was too late to return the package.  It may be because a "case" of these will last me for nearly a year.<br /><br />That said, if I can find them at a local grocery store, I will buy individual packages.

review/summary: Not Your Average Bouillon Cubes!
review/text: If you buy these bouillon cubes thinking they will be like the salt-filled cubes you buy at any grocery store, think again. The texture is different. Solubility is different. Taste is different.<br /><br />First let's discuss texture. The texture of these cubes is a lot like firm butter that was just taken out of the fridge. You can cut it like butter, so dividing is not a problem the way it is with salty, powdery cubes. It does tend to stick to the foil wrapper, but comes off easily using a knife, fork, or even spoon.<br /><br />We will go on to solubility. When you put these into hot water or put them in cold water then heat in the microwave, they do not break down as quickly as you might be accustomed to. The pieces that come apart in the water need to be stirred momentarily and pressed against the side of the container with a spoon. This does not take more than a minute.<br /><br />The taste is different, too. It has an inviting aroma and tastes like actual vegetable broth.  There is no overpowering salty taste, and these can be used to make a stronger tasting liquid than high-sodium cubes.<br /><br />This bouillon makes a great gravy when you use the whole cube in 1-1/2 cups boiling water. Stir 3 tbsp of corn starch into 1/4 cup cold water. Stir cold cornstarch water into boiling liquid till thickened. Add a little pepper and serve.<br /><br />I've also used it to flavor soy based textured vegetable protein (TVP) for use in meatless meatloaf and other dishes.  I just use it in place of the boiling water.  I like to use a bit stronger broth for that purpose.<br /><br />I give this product very high marks. Buy with confidence. Whether you are vegetarian or not, whether you are salt-restricted or not, this bouillon does not disappoint.
