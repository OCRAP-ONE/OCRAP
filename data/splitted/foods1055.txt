review/summary: Awesome Cookies and great package size!
review/text: My daughter tried these cookies at a celiac camp she was at and fell in love wih them.  In addition to her loving the cookies, what is great about them is their grab bag type.  Being gluten/dairy/perservative/dye free often she feels different (and a little embarrassed) with the types of foods she eats.  This size is like having something most of her peers eat but it's healthy.  Another benefit is her non-gluten sensitive brother also loves them.  That is the real test, if the gluten eating kids like it!

review/summary: I was pleasantly surprised at how good these cookies are
review/text: I have Celiac Disease and have tried several brands of gluten free "bought" cookies as I call them.  I have always been disappointed and resorted to baking my own.  Although baking my own is fine, sometimes I would like the convenience of being able to have cookies on hand when the urge strikes, or to grab when I'm on the go.  I ordered a "case" each of the oatmeal and the sugar cookies and was very pleased with both of them, although I slightly favored the oatmeal.  I purposely tried to detect the usual "off taste" that I've found in other cookies - there is no "off taste" to either of these flavors.  Both cookies are crisp, just the way I like them....I have just one word for them "yummy"!

review/text: These are pretty darn good cookies!  I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00213IAUQ">Lucy's Cinnamon Thins, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a> but these are a close second.<br /><br />The cookies are crunchy, not chewy.  They do have a lot of sugar on the top but it is only noticeable if you have several at a time.  Seemed sweeter  to me than the cinnamon thins.<br /><br />Not crumbly or cakey.  No funky taste.<br /><br />Only 8 in the package, not very many at all.  Putting that in a positive light, you can consider it built-in portion control.  Handy if you're like me and sometimes happen to snack without actually paying attention to how much you are eating.

review/text: As someone who has been at this for a very long time...wheat free that is... I have tried dozens and dozens of gluten free cookies.<br />A cookie-a-holic I have to have my morning coffee with a cookie.<br />Up until this point most of the gluten free cookies have been huge disappointments..<br />I have thrown more practically full boxes of cookies in the trash than I care to remember...they were just not worth the calories, they were that bad.<br />I do like Pamela's brand Biscotti cookies...but they are the only other cookie I've found good enough to spend the money on.<br />And lets face it prejudice abounds in the gluten free aisle...everything is outrageously expensive.<br />But these..they are lovely, crunchy, no grainy texture, no strange after taste, vegan, low calorie and low fat...actually a miracle of a cookie.<br />Most gluten free cookies are loaded with fat...and as I limit fat content that was another big draw back.<br />No problem here though, only 1.5-2 grams of fat per 4 cookie serving.<br />I have tried all 4 flavors and each is excellent, I don't think any would disappoint.

There are so many additives in today's food, that it is nice to know that there is a product that is completely natural.  You also have the feeling that you can trust this product, since you know that she created this for her own child. The calorie count is less than other cookies, and it also does nto affect diabetics as significantly as regular cookies do. I highly recommend this product, as well as her other cookies. While I do love chocolate chip, my absolute favorite would be the cinnamon.  Enjoy!!

review/summary: What a Treat!
review/text: I have a son who is allergic to milk, eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts; however, he can eat wheat.  We have tried lots of allergy-friendly products and are sometimes disappointed with the wheat-free ones as the texture and taste is often very different from products made with traditional ingredients.  That is not the case with these cookies.  They are by far the best allergy-friendly cookies that we have tried yet!  They have a nice, crisp (but not hard) cookie texture.  I was also impressed with the shelf-life on the cookies that we tried.  Many allergy-friendly cookies have a very short shelf-life, but the Lucy's cookies that we tried today didn't expire until October.  Way to go Dr. Lucy on creating an excellent allergy-friendly product!

Not only are they super safe for children (or anyone) with food allergies, they are delicious.  I find myself purchasing some just when i get a cookie craving.  they are hands down the best line of cookies I have ever had....Great flavor (you would NEVER know that these were produced with safe products rather than traditional cookie ingredients).  I think one of the hardest thing for parents and relatives and friends of people with allergies is finding GOOD, tasty foods...especially sweets.  If you have a loved one with a food allergy, i think you should stock these in your pantry (but beware, you will find yourself craving them as well!!!)

Since a lot of the gluten-free foods I've tried have left (IMHO) something to be desired, these were a very pleasant surprise. The grandkids love them too - a true test of cookie goodness.<br /><br />I can buy these locally for about $3 per 5.5 ounce box. I offer this info so that buyers can decide if Amazon's current price, whatever it may be, is a bargain.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: As a mom with Celiac disease with one son that has a tree nut allergy and another that has a soy allergy, I really wanted to like these cookies.  We are used to cooking everything from scratch to ensure the safety of our food.  Wouldn't it be great to have a cookie that my tree nut allergic son and I could grab on the go?  I paid a visit to my local Starbucks to pick up a 1.25 oz. pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package.  The smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off.  The bag had a synthetic odd smell inside.  I took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness-a good thing about the cookie- but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste.  It almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor. A very odd and unpalatable taste indeed. I was so disappointed.  I really liked the story of Dr. Lucy and the idea of the cookie, but most definitely did NOT like the cookie. Although I would classify myself as a bit of a food snob with high standards, I put that aside when reviewing this cookie.  I do not think even the less discerning customer would enjoy this cookie.

They are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale, and then they leave an awful aftertaste.  They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.<br /><br />There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.<br /><br />Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies.

review/text: The first time I made the Dixie Carb Counters Country Biscuit Mix, I thought they were dry little sand biscuits.  It came with a second bag so I tried the suggestion on the back to add shredded cheese (I also used some garlic powder to taste).  It really reminded me of the Red Lobster Cheesy Biscuits you get at the restaurant.  My husband couldn't believe it when he saw me eating the biscuits again since I almost choked the first time!  The biscuits came out moist and tasty when I used the shredded cheese so I really warmed up to them after I made them a little differently.

I have been doing low carb for a long time, so I understand that even though something is advertised as something such as a "country biscuit" that it wont have the same consistancy or taste that a regular biscuit would.  However, this was NOTHING even resembling or tasting like a biscuit.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product.  Every last bit of this went into the trash, along side the money I spent to purchase it.

review/text: I saw a show about this product. The way it was made, the uses for it and everyone concerned had only good things to say about the company and the product and since I do like the oriental twist, if I may, I decided to buy it. Already used it and the results were very decent and everyone seemed to enjoy my version of Shrimp Lo Mein? (have to learn chinese one of these years) and that is good enough. Tried to shop for it locally but since I reside in an area that shies away from most things of culinary value I had to resort to my good old friend Amazon.com. I see a day not too far off in the future when Amazon might step up and become the reigning champ on the gourmet category. Hopefully when that day arrives they will be the ones selling the products, so us happy Prime Members can rejoice and stop paying 3rd parties fees. A person can dream, that is for sure! 4 Stars for Lee Kum Kee-Premium Oyster Sauce 18 oz (accept no substitutes!).

review/text: I like Special K, but this product loses its crunch very quickly. It turns starchy and is like eating sweet mush. I won't be ordering this again. In fact, I will probably throw away the few cups I have remaining.

review/summary: Not an old world recipe
review/text: There were no ingredients listed, but since it was advertised as an "old world recipe", I bought them. I expected butter and sugar, not corn syrup and coconut oil. Very odd taste, not at all like a traditional caramel.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: Having bought these as stocking stuffers, I thought these caramels were a great value.  I saved a box for myself and was very pleased with the flavor.  I found it interesting that depending on what I had just eaten, or not eaten, previously to the caramel affected the saltiness I detected (sometimes salty, sometimes not).  The only mild complaint would be that the wrapper is slightly sticky and difficult to remove...but hey, they are caramels afterall!  And this may actually help to slow down the consumption!

review/summary: Could be saltier, not gourmet, arrived melted
review/text: I agree with one reviewer that I'd like a little more salt. Mine arrived very melted, in one giant clump. They are very sticky so it was quite messy to eat them. I do live in a warm climate so I kind of expected to have that issue. They taste pretty good but if you are looking for a gourmet sea salt and caramel candy, you won't be thrilled with these. I tried a sea salt caramel in a wine store and was amazed, it was delicious but a package of only 5 candies was very pricey so I ordered these. Next time I think I'll just spend the money for a smaller amount of really good quality caramels. These are much better than the caramels you can buy in a grocery store, just not quite salty enough for me.

review/summary: Very Disappointing
review/text: As another reviewer said, these salted caramels are full of unpleasant ingredients such as coconut oil, making them unhealthy. If you're going for healthy, caramel isn't your best bet anyway,  but traditional ingredients would be better. Not only that, but these taste processed, and have an unpleasant mouth feel.<br /><br /> I have tasted Bequet salted caramel; it's soft and chewy with well developed (and yummy) traditional buttery flavor. The sea salt is in discrete peices, crunching slightly when you chew or blooming on your tongue. By contrast, the Carosel caramels  taste like someone boiled up vanilla coffee creamer and stirred in some normal table salt.<br /><br />GAH! Do yourself a favor and go for the Bequet.<br /><br />.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00376ZEY6">Bequet Gourmet Celtic Sea Salt Caramel - 8 oz bag</a>

I know one reviewer thought they were too salty, I actually would have liked them to be just a little saltier.  The combination of sweet and salty is just soooo good in general and these were pretty darn good.

review/text: I bought these caramels based on the customer review. Mine were very salty and somewhat melted together. The caramel was very smooth and nice sized pieces. There were no more available so Amazon is giving me a refund. I like to try new things. So I will continue this practice based on the fact that Amazon backs what they sell! Thank You very much!

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I purchased after reading many reviews.  Use on face, chest and hands.  The first application was not dramatic as far as results go; but I use daily and the results are fantastic.  It took me about a week to get the impressive results.  I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look.  Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating.  My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking.  I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes.  Remove  in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture.  The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it.  This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant!  My hands were looking rough.  My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help.  I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion.  Finally my hands look very nice.  I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out.  I also use the eye treatment, spray toner (use throughout the day to freshen up makeup), body polish and body creams. Sometimes I can get lucky and find this product line in stores; but not very often.  Finally a product line that works!

review/text: This product is amazing. It works great, smells great, is all organic and is about 4x cheaper than any other enzyme peel on the market (because it is half the price and twice the size). You can also get it almost anywhere. It made a huge difference on my skin and I would recommend it to anyone who has acne or a dull, bumpy complexion. The one down side is that it stings quite a bit, but it's supposed to do that. And afterward it feels great.

review/text: I'm really happy I tried this moisturizer, it is amazing. At first I didn't think 3oz of this stuff would be enough to last me very long but a little really goes a long way. My skin soaks it right in but you only need a little bit of it. I think I use less a dime-sized amount to cover my entire face. It's not greasy at all and just leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft. The first time I used it at night, I used it before going to bed and when I woke up the next morning, my face was noticeably clearer. It even helped diminish my pimples.

review/text: This seems to be a good all-around moisturizer.  I use it at night, as I like my day products to contain an spf.  It sinks in well and leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.  It doesn't cause breakouts (which is easy to do with my sensitive skin).  My luck with Alba products has mostly been great with one exception.  The Sea renewal cream was way too oily and harsh on my skin.  Other than that, I've never been disappointed.  If you are looking for gentle, oil-free moisture, this is your golden ticket.

review/summary: Mild but effective!
review/text: I don't know how I will ever use any other face wash ever again! This cleanser is amazing! It's very light but very effective at removing my makeup (I wear Bare Minerals). Unlike other cleansers, my skin doesn't feel dry and tight after I rinse. Instead, it feels soft and moisturized so I know it's not stripping my own natural oils.<br /><br />The cleanser is clear, with a fantastic scent, that works up into a rich lather. I have not tried the Pineapple Scrub, but when I want some exfoliation, I lather up my face with the cleanser and dab on some plain white table sugar. After some gentle massage, I wash everything off and my skin feels great!<br /><br />I have combo skin with acne around the chin and cheeks and this cleanser never hurts, stings, or irritates my blemishes (unlike a lot of other products). Since my acne is mainly from resting my chin/cheeks on my hands, until that habit stops I will always have breakouts. Luckily, this cleanser works so well and now that my skin feels so good, I don't want to touch my face anymore!

review/text: When I bought this I was really going out on a limb. I like to read reviews for all skin care product before purchasing. This cleanser has a surprisingly cooling effect on the skin. Reminds me of a mixture between Noxzema's foaming face wash that was discontinued and the Clean & Clear Morning Burst (which dries my face out beyond belief). I love the smell, and it cleans my Mac foundation off way better than Cetaphil. Great product!

review/summary: Fantastic exfoliator
review/text: I bought this because exfoliants with small granules were too rough on my dry skin. I got a professional facial to help with my dry skin and they recommended a fruit enzyme peel that will dissolve dry skin without being so rough. Of course they wanted me to purchase an incredibly expensive product, but I decided to do some looking on my own. I settled on this product and have been very pleased. I can use it daily without it being too harsh on my skin and it dissolves all flaky, dry skin on my face. Even using it daily or every other day, the product has lasted a while (bought it in mid-August and still going here at Thanksgiving). It smells pleasant and feels soothing on my skin. Also, I think that Amazon had this listed as a liquid, but in reality it's a thick gel.

review/summary: Love the smell, how it feels, skin looks refreshed after!
review/text: I am usually critical of skin care product that doesn't come from a dermatologist's office.  Mainly because those products and brands can have more active ingredients than store product getting better results.  This stuff is so great! I love the smell, it feels really cool and refreshing on my skin (almost like aloe), and my skin really does look shinier and refreshed after I use it.  Also, it only has to stay on for 5 minutes so it's something I can do more often than masks that require 20-30 minutes.

review/text: This cream is more for normal to oily skin rather then dry/mature skin.  It goes on nicely and gets absorbed quickly.  It leaves a nice smooth feel on your skin like the more expensive creams do.  However this cream has an overpowering sweet jasmine smell.  The smell does not fade.  People will only smell your face cream.  This could be used as face cream/cheap perfume. I thought I can get used to the smell but it's too strong and rather unpleasent.

review/summary: Amazing product for what you pay for it.....
review/text: I've used this product considerably since I've moved to a different climate.  In this climate I break out along my t-zone, which I never had an issue before, but using this product enables me to help minimize and control the breakouts.  I also notice that this product helps fade away old acne scars.. not completely, but it does help minimize the appearance.  I have combo skin, therefore I only dab it on the affected or broken out areas rather than putting it all over my face because I noticed it did dry out my dry areas.  I also use it everyday on the affected areas without any issues.  I can't answer in terms of pores, but I do feel like the next morning after applying this product my skin tone looks more even.

review/text: I bought this product because I was looking for something more natural for my sensitive skin.  Says its "gentle for all skin types" but it's not.  Literally 2 seconds after I put the first dab on my face it started burning. I could see my skin turning red and getting a rash under it.  I had to wash it off immediately.  The spot that had it does feel softer than the rest of my face, but the burning and rash is SO not worth it.  My second complaint is that it's a gel mask versus a clay mask.  I should have read the ingredients better for that one though.

review/text: I love this product.  I have sensitive skin, & this is really gentle & soothing.  I also try to avoid wearing foundation, but this moisturizer wears well under Physician's Formula Organic Wear Foundation.  (I haven't tried it with any other foundation products).  I exfoliate every other day & apply this afterward, as well as after getting out of the shower.  The fragrance isn't too strong, and I love that its oil free, because I have extremely oily skin.  (I obviously wash my face on a regular basis as well in addition to exfoliating.)  This is a hard product to review because people's needs, opinions, & skin types are so different.  I was initially hesitant to pay so much for it, but in comparison to other oil free moisturizers, this one is about the same cost, & isn't full of harsh chemicals, fillers, & other crap that clogs your pores up.  Just my two cents.

review/text: I've been using this face mask for years. It is much cheaper buying it online than at your local drugstore. I use it about twice a week on my entire face, but almost daily just under my eyes. I apply it there when I wake up, pre-shower. It does a nice job of tightening the baggy skin under my eyes. It's not surgery so the effect doesn't last forever but it does help. I've had no adverse reactions from using Alba Botanica Papaya Enzyme facial mask.

review/summary: Oily dilemma...
review/text: I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  A word of caution if you already have oily prone skin... This created more oil.  I only used it at night and when I woke the next morning I was shoked at the sheen of oil covering my entire face.  I was disgusted.  Granted, it didn't appear to clog pores, nor make my acne worse (I am an unfortunate sufferer of that infamous adult acne around the mouth and chin area).<br /><br />A nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  Especially those nights following a toner that can sometimes leave that sting behind.  I love the smell of it too.  I have since switched to only applying it outside of my t-zone, and while I still discover oil the next morning, it isn't near as bad as before.<br /><br />I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won't continue to use this.  Unfortunately there just aren't a lot of moisterizers with green tea, which is what I was looking for.

review/summary: Papaya Mask
review/text: Just started using this and the smell is a little odd at first but its not too bad. I got some on my lips by accident and my lips started feeling numb. Not sure what that was about. I like that its not a mask that you have to scrub off. This one just rinses right off. After I rinsed it off I instantly saw my skin look a little more brighter and glowy after the first use.

review/summary: Long lasting lip balm
review/text: I've been using blistex for decades, burts bees for years and I just found this in the organic section at wal mart.  I like coconut and decided to give this a try.<br />Seriously, in my pockets always are my wallet, keys and lip balm.  I've worked outdoors for years and depend upon it's protection from the elements.  Blistex is fine, but I wanted something more organic, Burts Bees is great, but I don't like their tube as much 'cause sometimes I keep this in my bra (when I don't have pockets)and it's scratchy and the peppermint is annoying at times.  (I have yet to try the others)<br />But this Coconut Cream lip balm is really amazing.  It last for a really really long time.  I put it on before bedtime and in the morning there's still some on my lips, protecting and smoothing them.  I like the feel and the flavor and will be purchasing this product for many years to come now that I have discovered it!  Invest the 3 bucks and see for yourself if it isn't better than what you're using.

review/text: After recently having a professional facial, I have been interested in finding an OTC enzyme mask for use at home that isn't as expensive as the $60/jar product the facial was selling.<br /><br />The scent of this product is quite lovely.  After 3 uses I can feel a slight difference in my skin.  The only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars is that I wish it were stronger!

And, a second application before bedtime prepares my face for shaving in the morning.  I have used the product successfully for 3+ years.

review/summary: I always come back to this product
review/text: I have really sensitive skin; it reacts poorly to almost everything (including hard water), it is dry in spots and oily in others, and it definitely sees a blemish from time to time. I've tried just about every product out there because I am easily swayed by advertisements for new organic facial products, but I always come back to this line. Unlike most products for 'troubled' skin, which contain harsh salicycle acid, this product doesn't make my break-outs worse at all. It's oil free, so even after a long day my nose doesn't feel slick, and it's nice and light so it goes great under make-up. The scent is fantastic and a little jar goes a long way because you need so little of it. If your skin is like mine, I recommend the pineapple enzyme cleanser, the habiscus toner, the papaya mask, and this moisturizer. That regiment keeps me clear, soft, and smelling like the tropics. The only thing I don't use is the eye gel, which is a bit too light for the eye area.

review/summary: Deep Cleansing Fruity Face Scrub
review/text: Alba's Pineapple Enzyme Facial Scrub is deliciously pineapple with hints of orange juice and dreams of coconut drinks on beaches somewhere very far from home. The tropical escape factor is very present all while the scrub works overtime to remove dull surface cells. Lavender, Aloe, Jojoba, Pineapple, Papaya, Awapuhi, Bromelain and Vitamin E are the base for this creamy cleanser enhanced with a botanical fragrance. The exfoliating granules are very mild and the aloe makes this extra soothing. After one use you can see results in tone/texture and moisture balance, after three uses, you may find yourself ordering a second tube. It is that impressive. Looking forward to trying the travel kit because the products have amazing summery scents that remind me of warm days at the beach.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Not for Sensitive Skin - Read Ingredients First
review/text: I love the Alba products because they contain lots of natural ingredients and are a great value for the price, plus I've always had good resutls with them.  I use the sea kelp products and really like them but decided to try something different for the summer, so I ordered the Jasmine moisturizer and the hibiscus facial toner.  The jasmine cream is wonderful and works great on my dry skin but, unfortunately, the hibiscus facial toner caused severe burning to my skin. After I read the entire ingredient listing, I was shocked to find this toner contains sodium hydroxide which is used in such harsh cleaning products as oven and drain cleaners.  I do have sensitive skin which, I am certain, caused the reaction.  I don't think this product is for sensitive skin, but be sure to read the entire ingredient list before you decide to purchase it, and if possible, try a sample of it first.  I went back to the sea kelp facial toner and have had no further problems.

review/summary: Great Moisturizer, Overpowered by Scent
review/text: This product moisturizes very nicely. It goes on very smooth and stays on for awhile. I really wanted to love this cream, but the smell is just so overpowering. I was expecting a soft, light scent, but this is just so strong and overpowering that it almost makes you dizzy. The smell does not diminish the longer you wear it; I put the cream on before bed, and woke up the next morning smelling like I had just put it on. It's very unfortunate, in my opinion the smell makes the cream unwearable.

review/summary: WOW
review/text: I actually ended up buying this from walmart because I was in need of an oil free moisturizer for my face...BADLY and didn't want to way 4-5 days for my order to process on here. So I purchased it (and I cringed at the thought of spending 15 bucks on a small container of moisturizer), and applied it to my clean face in the morning and before bed. Let me tell you...<br /><br />THIS THING ZAPPED MY PIMPLES LIKE NO TOMORROW!!!<br /><br />Not only did it feel nice and silky on my face, and it soaked in, but it just cleared my face up! I was so surprised. I thought it was too good to be true and maybe it happened to be one of those days that my skin decided to clear uyp on it's own. But no, I was wrong... and thank goodness. I continued using the moisturizer twice a day for a week and my face just stayed clear for the entire week. I was so happy!<br /><br />This stuff is definitely worth the money, and it WILL last you quite a long time since a little DOES go a long way. How little you ask? Just lightly, and quickly tap your finger onto the surface of the moisturizer and that's all you'll really need!<br /><br />Five stars, baby. FIVE STARS!

review/summary: Great cleanser...but watch the eyes!
review/text: I have very sensetive skin (and very hard water!) so it's hard for me to find a cleanser that doesn't irritate or dry out my skin. Albas Pinapple face wash is gentle, cleans my face very well and has a wonderful, refreshing pineapple scent to it. A small amount worked into a lather in your hands will do the job. Why only 4 stars? It's VERY thick and needs a little extra time to wash off. I've opened my eyes in the shower a few times thinking this was rinsed clean only to find excess pineapple enzyme wash in my eyes...and it stings! This is the only face wash I've used like that which is very odd. I attribute it to its thick texture and the fact that I have very hard water. Be careful with this! Make sure it's rinsed really really well before you open up your eyeballs. Other than that, it's a great product and my favorite facial cleanser :)

review/text: I have always like Alba brand products from the standpoint that they use plant-based ingredients which are far better for the skin than the other more expensive brands found at Macy's and the like. One only needs to use about a peas-size for the face as it can be a bit oily. Overall, it's a good product that I can use right before applying my make-up and use again after washing my face. This jar will last me quite awhile, so I can appreciate that. Pleasant smell too, not overwhelming with fragrance like most facial creams.

Inevitably some lip balm is going to get inside the mouth when using it, and this is fine as it tastes like coconut which I love! Not only that but the ingredients are safe - its not loaded up with chemicals like most.  Its the perfect lip balm and I hope it never gets discontinued.... I simply cant go without it, and have never found a lip balm as awesome as this one!

review/summary: It's alright
review/text: It smells nice, and has a thick consistency, but rather than call it a scrub, I'd call it a cleanser ; the particles meant to be scrubbing your face aren't big enough to do much scrubbing; if you want a very,very,very gentle scrub then this may be for you, but for those of you who have used the St.Ives Apricot scrub, and want something more effective then you should look elsewhere. On the plus side, it is partially organic, and natural, and as I mentioned earlier it smells nice. I just saw a review about how it smelled like rotten pineapples, and how it caused a pimple outbreak on the reviewer-I'm guessing it was either expired, or had gone bad so don't let that scare you away from trying it-you might like it. As for me,I need something with bigger particles so maybe I'll just do a homemade scrub with sugar-or better yet, I can add a little sugar to the scrub to make it more effective. Oh, and before I forget, my face did look a little brighter after I used the scrub. It isn't allthat bad, but it's just not what I was looking for in a scrub.

review/summary: Best facial product
review/text: This has turned out to be one of the best facial products I have ever used.<br />I have bought some products for a much higher price that did not work as well.<br />It also has a very pleasant smell. I will try more of this manufacturer's products in the future.

review/summary: Powerful punch
review/text: This coffee will burn off the fog.  It gets me going in the morning and I feel like doing a Marathon run.  Genuine real coffee. I try other Espresso's and like a few, but always come back to Medaglia D'Oro.  Sometimes when I drink Illy I spice it up with Medaglia D'Oro for more down to earth real coffee flavor.
