review/summary: Lots of Flavor
review/text: On a gluten free diet, the selection of normal side dishes is limited to rice, potatoes or rice noodles.  Overall, this spices up the rice alternative a bit.  I have tried different flavors of the Lundberg Risotto, this one is the most spicy with bounds of flavor.

review/summary: Great unsweetened cocoa powder that doesn't make you break out
review/text: I've been using this cocoa powder very regularly for about 4 weeks now (I mix it with a denatured whey that I drink in the mornings), and I really, really like it.<br /><br />First of all, it adds a great chocolate taste to my whey drink.<br /><br />And secondly (and of equal import!), it doesn't make me break out.<br /><br />All other chocolate that I consume makes me break out, so, of course, I can't eat/drink it very often.<br /><br />Thanks heavens this isn't true about this Nestle Toll House Cocoa.<br /><br />I can only hypothesize as to why this is true, and have two possible reasons:<br /><br />  1.  It isn't Dutch-processed (hasn't been alkalized); or<br />  2.  It's a purer form of chocolate that doesn't have some of the additives that<br />  are often added to chocolate.<br /><br />Regardless of whether either of the above hypotheses are true, it simply doesn't make me break out (hooray!!!)!!

review/summary: Good Salt!
review/text: I was at a health and wellness conference-- of all places-- when I was introduced to this salt by the manufacturer at the exhibitor's hall.  However, I had to agree with him that salt has taken a bit of a bad rap lately.  It isn't that salt is bad, it is the tons of salt dumped into most prepared foods that is bad!  Anyway, I was a bit skeptical at first about a better salt.  Isn't all salt the same?  The exhibitor gave me a bag to try when I got home.  Now it is all we use!  Maybe I am fooling myself, but this salt just seems to have so much more flavor!  And unlike bleached out white rice or white bread or washed out white salt, this naturally pink-colored salt has all the minerals nature originally put into it!

review/summary: The Best Salt EVER!
review/text: We first found this salt on a trip to Utah in the 90's and  brought some back home.  Used it, loved it, and at that time, was able to find an obscure online store that sold it so we bought some more but ran out long ago. Fast forward 7 years. We are SO happy to find this on Amazon.  This is the best salt...all of the trace minerals make it taste fabulous, we are actually using the salt more and really enjoying it but there are no side effects like puffiness or swelling hands.  I buy the large crystals so I can use it in my salt grinder.  It is really pretty and pink!

review/summary: TOO MUCH GRIT FROM SAND, BLACK PARTICLES
review/text: I purchased this product from Follow Your Heart natural food store in So. Cal.  I noticed big chunks of black particles in it.  I then went online to Amazon and found some people complaining about maybe chipping a tooth from hard substances.  Pre-preemptively, I pulverized this product in my mortar and pestle.  Have you ever been at the beach and you get sand in your food, and it is grinding in your teeth?  This has been my experience with this product, and I am returning it today and will never purchase any salt from this manufacturer.  Going back to Himalayan salt, and might try Celtic Salt for the first time, but not just now, I need a rest.

review/summary: DELICIOUS & healthy
review/text: Found this salt in a Utah cafe on a road trip in 2003-ish. At that time I could only get replacements from the company on line, but I'd bother ordering a bunch it every couple of years because I can tell my body really responds well to this salt. The taste is delicious, and I don't bloat or feel puffy from it. I have since tasted many other sea salts since they are now so trendy... This is still my favorite! Now they sell it in nearby grocery stores, but not the course grind that I love in the salt grinder. So I'm on line to buy again!  Introduced it to a lot of friends over the years....

review/summary: Hard to find, but delicious
review/text: As a 'Brit abroad' I have been receiving shipments of stem ginger via visiting friends from the UK but now I see it's here on Amazon!  Stem ginger is distinctly different from crystallized ginger or any other types of chopped ginger that I've found here.  When I described it to a co-worker she had no concept of what I was talking about.<br />In England we use stem ginger for a variety of purposes - making ginger cake with 'bits' in, in savoury cooking e.g. with chicken and with melon balls as an appetizer.  I even used to have stem ginger sandwiches as a child!  Stem ginger also pairs well with rhubarb if you're making a pie or crumble.  BTW if you are going to try the melon idea make sure you chop the globes of ginger really small - it's strong stuff!  Even the syrup is nice poured over icecream.

review/summary: Elegant and unique food item
review/text: I truly love the Stem Ginger in Syrup most particularly, during the Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays.  For those of you that like to provide a dish that is different from standard fare this is the foodstuff to use.  My main reason for purchasing the Stem Ginger in Syrup is for a sweet potato recipe.  I shall put my recipe below.<br /><br />Take one to two pieces of the stemmed ginger and "mince" into many tiny pieces.  Be patient and do this.  In a frying pan, put a quarter pound or one stick of butter.  Sautee this mixture until good and hot and let the flavor infuse the butter.  One family size can of sweet potatos, yams, however they are called.  You can find them at holiday time already spiced most specially with cinnamon etc.  Take your casserole and place well drained sweet potatos and mash them with a fork lightly.  Pour your mixture of stem ginger/butter over the potatos and add about a cup of brown sugar.  Stir to mix well, but do not do it so heavily that you no longer have chunks of the sweet potato.  Pop into the oven at about 325 degrees and let bake until the dish is very hot.  You might even see a little bubbling around the pan.  A marvelous side to any holiday meal.  This is intensley sweet, almost like a desert.  It is clearly high in sugar and butter, but once or twice a year will do little harm.  Enjoy!

review/summary: This cured my corgi's arthritis and helped his allergies.
review/text: I have an eight year old corgi who is my security system and my baby.  He has had allergies all of his life, but recently they had gotten worse, with him having open sores on his underbelly, and bloodshot eyes, despite bi-weekly baths and benadryl.  In an attempt to help his allergies I put him on these treats and the corresponding kibble.  Six weeks later, his eyes are clear, he has stopped scratching, and his skin is much less red.<br /><br />However, this dog food did something else, something that is amazing.  Corgis are very prone to arthritis and hip problems.  My corgi had also developed what looked like fairly advanced arthritis in all four legs, with a limp that seemed to move from hip to hip, depending on the weather. Aside from an occasional limp on one paw damaged by rolling his entire body weight over one shoulder from three feet in the air in a bad frisbee catch, his gait is entirely normal.  I never thought I would see him move like this again.  Amazing stuff.

review/text: I feed my baby organic baby food from several different brands.  I must say that Sprout tastes the most like real table food.  If you look at the ingredients, you can tell that a lot of thought is put into making these taste like real food.  Plus, they are extremely filling and nutritious.  I have tasted this one, and if salt were added (of course I wouldn't want that in my baby's food), it would taste like a very delicious canned soup.<br /><br />If these are available locally, I would suggest buying one pouch of several different varieties before investing in 12 pouches of a flavor that your baby may or may not like.  My local grocery store carries them as well as Walmart.<br /><br />ETA:  I just noticed that amazon doesn't list the ingredients.  The ingredients for this flavor as well as all of the others can be found on the Sprout website.  I will copy them here.<br /><br />Organic Ground Chicken, Filtered Water, Organic Yukon Gold Potatoes, Organic Corn, Organic Peas, Organic Cream (organic cream, carrageenan), Organic Carrots, Organic Onions, Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Organic Garlic, Organic Vegetable Base (organic carrots, organic onions, organic celery, organic canola oil, organic carrot powder, organic potato flour, organic onion powder), Organic Sage.

He likes the minestrone but the other two are a completely different story.  First, they smell absolutely disgusting.  It's like herbaceous cat food.  Worse than cat food... I feed my cats canned food every day and it does not make me want to vomit like this stuff does.  But I thought I'd let my son give it a try... He hates it.  He spits it out and then he tries to scrape off all the ground meat that sticks to his tongue, poor thing.  In contrast, he has loved all of the Happy Baby meals I've given him, as well as my homemade meals.  He is by no means a picky eater.

review/text: When I first started to buy VitaGravy, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.

review/summary: chiles.  chiLES.  CHILES!!!!!!!
review/text: I "love" to eat cajun and creole cuisine.  I have eaten at K-Paul's restaurant in New Orleans and own a time-share on St. Charles street.  Got the time share because I knew I'd be going back for the fun and (especially) the food!!!<br /><br />Since then, alot has happened.  My (insert ugly adjective here) wife took my beloved children and left and, suddenly, I have to (amongst other things) cook for myself.  Well folks, I've learned alot from this.  For one thing, I am a much better cook than she ever was!!!  These wonderful chiles are one of the reasons why.<br /><br />I have acquired several of Chef Paul's cook books and so many of the recipes call for these chiles.  At first, I didn't know about this chile pack and would buy dried chiles from my local farmer's market (when they had them).  Unfortunately, they only had two or three types and "never" the others that Paul uses (like the ancho - Chef Paul seems to favor this one rather heavily).  On top of that, the chiles that I did get would need to be prepared (i.e. de-seeded and grinded).  This process would take me forever - I mean "hours" - to do.  By the time I would have the chiles ready, I no longer had the energy to make the darn recipe.<br /><br />I know, I know, I know.  I could always buy a spice grinder.  Well folks, I've used them before (I think the "burr" grinders are - head and shoulders - the better type; Kitchen-Aid has it "workin"), but to me, they are more trouble than they are worth.  For 25 bucks, I can "get the spices" (and I mean "all" of them) and have them already grinded!!!  This, folks, is a no-brainer.<br /><br />Get these folks.  Then, you can be "true" to the cajun and creole recipes you choose to recreate in your own private kitchen.  There is no way that you can end up sad if you choose to get these wonderful spices!!!  They are endorsed by the master, himself!!!

review/summary: A good starter set for those who want to "Kick it up a notch!"
review/text: I love hot peppers, hot sauces and ground chili peppers.  I grow peppers, roast them and grind them myself, but I also like to collect and use a wide variety of store-bought products such as this one.  Since Chef Prudhomme was one of the first (if not the first) to bring Cajun food into the mainstream, fine dining scene, I felt confident in trying this ground chili assortment that bears his name.<br /><br />Over all I like it and would recommend it to someone who is interested in spicier food.  One thing to bear in mind it that "Spicy" does not necessarily mean hot.  Most of the chilies here are mild to medium.  As a matter of fact, each jar has a heat level rating for each pepper.  They break down like this:<br /><br />*  Anaheim (California Beauty) - Heat Level 2-3<br />*  New Mexico (Perfecto) - Heat Level 2-4<br />*  Guajillo - Heat Level 2-4<br />*  Ancho - Heat Level 3-5<br />*  Pasilla - Heat Level 3-5<br />*  Chipotle - Heat Level 7<br />*  Arbol - Heat Level 7.5<br /><br />Personally I think that both the Chipotle and the Arbol are milder than listed, but that's just an opinion.  Each bottle contains 1.3-1.5 ounces which is a fair amount for most people.  Bear in mind that ground chilies are best when consumed within 6-12 months after purchase (I have known people that keep the same jar of ground chili in their pantries for 10 years, but they will be far from their best.)<br /><br />Replacement bottles are sold separately but to be honest I just buy my ground chilies in bulk and then refill these bottles with that.  Again, a real nice starter set.

None. These are phenomenal!  First they have that enormous crunch that Royal Oak peanuts consistently provide.  Second is the GREAT seasonings they have added. The spices and flavorings are well balanced and create an "in your face", taste. But the real treat is the pepper bite. Light burn on the tongue and lips. Just the right amount. You will be hard pressed to put the can down before it is empty. These are FANTASTIC!!

review/summary: Good choco flavor; otherwise lacking
review/text: As a gluten-free chocoholic, I will say that these are the best mass-produced, gluten-free chocolate chocolate chip cookies I have found.  The quality of the chocolate is very good -- a nice, rich, bittersweet flavor.  The rest of the cookie, however, is disappointing.  The cookies are very thick (more than 1/4"), dry, and brittle.  That's rather surprising given their fat content:  a whopping 9g per serving.<br /><br />If you're a baker, you're better off making your own.  But if you're not a baker and you love dark chocolate, these might be right up your alley.

review/text: I used to have an allergy to wheat products.  I still try to eat a relatively gluten-free diet.  Therefore, I have been looking for a good cookie alternative.  These cookies are delicious.  They are slightly buttery-flavored and do not taste too grainy.  While they are slightly crumbly, they are better than any gluten-free cookie that I have come across.  Definitely a recommend buy for any gluten-intolerant person.  They have a great aftertaste too.<br /><br />One complaint: They are VERY addictive.  :D

Shame on Amazon. I love Amazon and order from them frequently every month and love their service. But regarding this issue I think THEY ARE WRONG not to voluntarily do the same thing. The government requires manufacturers to list ingredients in the order of largest content first. I had ordered this as part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save program because it sounded like a great product after reading the ingredient list on the site. Wrong. I had to relunctantly cancel it.<br />They taste great. No wonder with sugar as the largest ingredient.

They seem to be for the discriminating palate as they are dark chocolate. To me they seem to have a sophistication other cookies do not. I find them more convenient and delicious than others. Especially since I rarely bake. I hope amazon keeps these cookies on forever. Yes, it is true they are crumbly but it is easy enough to clean the mess. 170 calories per 2 cookies which is good if you're on a diet. Organic is a plus in my book. I'm using these to keep calories in me cause I ain't on no diet and need to gain weight due to health issues that have caused a major downfall. So, yes please, keep the cookies coming. - Smiles -

I ordered this from Amazon because it is a dollar less per box than in the Martin's store in their gluten-free aisle, and these are the best chocolate GF cookies we have ever eaten. BUT! The cookies arrived totally broken into very small pieces and loads of crumbs. Guess they would be great for a pie crust, tho. What a dissapointment. They are somewhat tender to begin with, and I don't know how Amazon can package them in a special way to prevent such destruction. We all know how packages are treated by the carriers who deliver them....not delicately, that's for sure. So, will never order these by mail again and must pay the exorbitent price the go for at Martin's. Pooh!

As they are, they are more sweet than chocolate, and shouldn't in any way be considered a "dark" chocolate.  They aren't bad, they just aren't what is expected by the product description.  They also arrived more crumbled than intact, a problem classic in gluten-free baked goods that can be easily corrected by tweaking the recipe.  This is not one of this line's best offerings.

review/text: Paula's cookies are my first experience with gluten-free products - and it was a great one. I think these are delicious, filling, and satisfy even the strongest chocolate craving or sweet tooth. When they arrive in crumbs it kinda stinks but I just eat the crumbs with a spoon or dump them in a baggie and use to sprinkle over my tofutti or fruit. I must admit the shortbread cookies are my fav but these are great when I need chocolate.

review/text: You do not have to be "Gluten Free" to enjoy these RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS cookies! They are Rich, Decadent and Divine. Even my wheat-eating boyfriend can't get enough of them. They are dangerous. A chocolate lover's dream. Just be warned: they're addictive and won't last very long in the cupboard unless you hide them from yourself! Not only the best GF cookies I've ever had, but the best cookies--period.

review/summary: Scrumptious, organic and gluten free!
review/text: I adore dark chocolate and found these cookies to be ultra-satisfying.  Their flavor was superb, as was the texture -- crisp without being hard, and the yummy chocolate chunks...of course, it was nice to at least pretend to be virtuous by purchasing and consuming them ("I'm supporting organic foods!")!  Let's face it, some cookies (and other foods) that purport to be healthier for you than others taste like cardboard.  These aren't like that.  In fact, my only complaint is that it's hard to stop eating them once I've opened a box!  But then, we all know that dark chocolate is a good source of antioxidants, so...

review/text: When these cookies are fresh and not overbaked, they are delicious.  They melt in your mouth, and the chocolate and chocolate chips are very chocolatey.  Recently, a shipment that we ordered was apparently not manufactured correctly.  The cookies were too hard and dry and the amount of chips seemed to be less than normal.  I'm hoping this was just a bad batch.  I hope Pamela's doesn't ruin a great product by inconsistent preparation processes.

review/text: These wheat-free, egg-free treats are tasty. I have bought the espresso ones, but I have to say these are better. It has a lot of chocolate chips its soo yummy, but it isnt sickeningly sweet. Its good to have with a nice cup of coffee.<br /><br />The only thing is I would suggest is they should give 2 cookies instead of 3 by making the cookies a tiny bit thinner. Somehow 2 was a little unsatisfying, and the cookies were like too thick for my taste.

I used to be a O*** cookie lover until I discovered the white sugar, regular salt, wheat and hydrogenated oil was "doing" me in. These cookies made by Pamela top the O*** cookie by miles.I have tried a few others also but always come back for more dark chocolate. Thanks for a new chocolate enjoyment.<br /><br />D<br /><br />PS if chocolate is not your "thing" the ginger cookies are excellent too, with bits of real ginger in each cookie.<br /><br />D

review/summary: Ridiculous Cookies
review/text: These cookies are ridiculous. I don't know what kind of chocolate is in these chunks, but it's got to be the richest, most decadent dark chocolate I've ever tasted. I thought it was just me, so I asked my sister if she'd like a cookie. She said, "Wow! These are SO good!" I didn't realize that they were gluten free until I read the label. I've never had a gluten free anything before. Maybe it's the organic chocolate. These are crispy little cookies that are so delicious that I think I may have addicted not only myself, but my sister too. Like other people with reviews here, I  ordered them to round out an order to qualify for free shipping. This is a "re-order" item now for sure.

review/text: I bought these cookies as a dairy free treat.  The flavor is good, but almost every cookie is in pieces with some reduced to crumbs.  They came in a sturdy box, but they were destroyed somewhere in the process.  I'm still eating them, I'm not crazy, they taste great, but I probably wouldn't buy them again.<br /><br />I found Divvie's cookies at a local store.  They were super-good and not crushed.  They are dairy, egg and nut free.  I would probably try ordering from Divvie's to see how their cookies hold up during shipping.

review/text: Very disappointed in these cookies - I was hoping for a something great and ended up with extremely dry cookies, some were already broke on arrival and others broke by just opening the individual bags. The cookies are small - the image here makes them look a decent/normal size but they really are a bit smaller. Case they are shipped in is great for storage, in fact that was probably the best thing about the purchase. Look elsewhere for Dark Chocolate chunk cookies though...unless you like dark, crumby hard ones.

review/text: Pamela's dark chocolate chocolate chunk cookies are delicious thick crisp cookies that will give you a sugar high.  They are very sweet.  If you are wanting a chocolate cookie that is as sweet as candy, look no further!  This one tastes great!  Amazon has them at a great price to sell too as my local Jimbo's sells them for $3.85 for the 5.29 oz box.  They keep fresh a long time.  I have ordered them several times from Amazon and it has been hit-or-miss for fresh unbroken cookies or something suitably to make a pie crust or so stale they are garbage, but Amazon stands behind the order and either replaces or refunds!  Way to go, Amazon!  Thank you!

review/summary: rich flavored chocolate cookies
review/text: These cookies are rich and creamy with a wholesome taste. They don't have a bitter taste like most dark chocolate does, so if you're looking for a traditional bitter taste this is not it. They aren't as soft as bakery cookies, but not crisp as crackers either-they are a medium softness.There are 9 cookies about 1 3/4" in diameter.<br /><br />The cookies are placed in a plastic container wrapped in a plastic bag within a heavy paper box. I opened a few boxes and looked in the window of the other boxes and none were cracked. I had bought them as Christmas gifts mostly because the current picture shows a red and green box, but I was disappointed that the box was actually orange and pale green. Nevertheless, one of my relatives liked them a lot and so did I.

review/summary: I like them, my 11-year old loves them and my husband dislikes them
review/text: When I got home from work, my cookies were waiting for me at the front door; baking in the sun on a 113�F day, probably for 2 or 3 hours.  Inside each pack, the two cookies melded together and would not separate.  They are about 2 inches in diameter and break/crumble easily.  They can actually be quite messy to eat, so beware giving them to a child or while wearing white.  ;)  They are not soft, moist or chewy at all, but not brittle either.  The center of the cookie has a small pool of dark chocolate that kind of oozes out when you partially bit into it.  The expiration date on the cookie wrappers were about 2 weeks from the date of arrival, so I store them in the freezer to keep longer.<br /><br />My 11-year old son, my husband and I tried them while they were still hot.  My husband (a junk-food-junkie) only ate half a cookie and threw away the rest.  He prefers soft cookies, so these were just too hard and bland to him.  He'd give these 2 stars.  My son, on the other hand, loves them and would give them 5 stars!  In fact, he chooses these over fudge popsicles and other favored deserts, which kind of surprises me.  He prefers the typical American child's diet, like pizza and hamburgers, so I was expecting him to throw his away too.<br /><br />I think the cookies have a rich DARK-chocolate taste (fringing on being too rich) and almost tastes like there is a hint of alcohol in them (like rum or something like that).  I don't know why I taste that, but I do every time.  I'm not a milk drinker; however, I usually need to drink it with these cookies.  It's easy only eating 1 package because they are too rich to want more.  I think these are good cookies, not great, and would personally give them 4 stars.<br /><br />I suspect that the unusual circumstances of waiting in 113�F weather tampered with the cookies texture and perhaps taste too.  I have never tried this brand of cookies before, so keep in mind I don't have any reference to compare these to.

review/text: These are good tasting cookies if you enjoy chocolate. Have a nice gooey chocolate center. They also have nice texture. I ususally enjoy best chewie chocolate chip type cookies, these are harder but not too hard.<br /><br />But that also does lead to their one drawback, they do tend to crumble and with the chocolate in the middle that can get a bit messy. One last positive point though. At least for the 2-count pack of 50, 2 is a great snack size. Enough to feel full but not too much. Recommended.
