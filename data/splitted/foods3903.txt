review/summary: Expensive
review/text: I've been trying to lose weight and have been using a meal replacement shake that comes in sweet cream flavor.  To jazz things up, I've been adding fruit, peanut butter, coffee, etc.  When I heard about PB2, I decided to give it a try.  The 6.5 oz sizes allow you to give the product a try before committing to a large quantity.  PB2 is very light and powdery.  It takes 2 Tbsp. (45 cal) to give a good peanut flavor.  The regular PB2 is better than the chocolate variety.  The chocolate flavor isn't very intense with more pronounced PB flavor.  It mixes well with the shake mix and tastes good.  The price is high considering the small number of servings you'd get per jar.  This was an ingenious way to make the by-product of pressing peanuts for oil into a valuable commodity!

review/summary: YUM!  And great for dieting
review/text: I LOVE PB2!!  It has replaced peanut butter in my morning oatmeal and saves me 50-100 calories and still tastes great.  I also mix it with greek yogurt.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I wish it came in bigger containers.  I know you can buy the shrink wrapped packages but those are hard to open/keep clean.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: I have a problem with willpower. I had to stop buying regular peanut butter because it was too easy to grab a spoon and go to town. But I do love a PB&J sandwich from time to time, so this stuff is a perfect compromise. It makes a good sandwich, but it doesn't taste quite good enough that I'm tempted to eat it by itself (maybe because the texture is slightly off as well). Also I tend to be lazy when I'm satisfying my cravings, so I'm more likely to grab something that doesn't require work (i.e. mixing). As a result, I'm only halfway through both of these jars after quite a few months. The price is probably a little high, but it's so much more healthy than regular peanut butter...it's definitely worth it to me, hence the 5-star rating. For taste and texture, I'd give it 3.5 stars (compared to real peanut butter).

Taste is actually a bit better to me than normal peanut butter and I can use more than a trace amount without feeling guilty! I do prefer the straight peanut butter flavor over the chocolate. Finally a nice PB&J sandwhich on whole wheat as a nice snack.

review/summary: Okay candy box, but too much filler
review/text: This candy box has a good number of sour candies. However, they have included alot of non-sour filler candies. I don't like this since it detracts from the reason I got this, to get lots of different sour candy. I would rather have cheap sour candies that the filler candy they put it here.<br /><br />Overall, not bad for the price, but there is too much filler candy that is not sour.

review/summary: Decent mix
review/text: I am not sure if every sampler contains the same candy, so I will be reviewing the candy I received in the box.<br /><br />Sour Power Strips<br />Just ok texture, decent sourness for a few seconds. I thought the flavor was really "plasticy" or something. My least favorite.<br /><br />Shock Popping Candy<br />Fun popping noise and sensation. Mild sourness. Just OK flavor. I thought the black packages had a weird flavor.<br /><br />Cry Baby Extra Sour Bubble Gum<br />Pretty good sour kick on the outside. Gives about 10 seconds of sour, then a good sweet flavor. Can't chew for more than a few minutes or so.<br /><br />Warheads<br />Great sour kick on the outside, then only sweet hard candy after that. Good flavor.<br /><br />Toxic Waste<br />Almost exactly the same as Warheads, except these have sour liquid in the middle. Good flavor. I like these more than Warheads, simply because of the sour liquid inside.<br /><br />Lemon Head<br />These are really not sour at all to me. Pretty good flavor. It is a hard candy.<br /><br />Matlow's<br />Also not really sour at all. Pretty good flavor. Hard candy.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I guess their attempt was to give a good mix of sour candy, from very sour to not very sour. That's great, but as a sour candy lover, I would have rather had all very sour candy. I mean, this is a "Super Sour" sampler, not a "Sweet and Sour" sampler. But for the price, it was good to buy once. Probably won't buy again.

review/text: I ordered this because I wanted to try out the toxic waste candy and it was about the same price for a package of that vs this product so I chose this one to get some variety. This was a good mix, I did not get any sour skittles in mine but that is alright. I did order the one without the magic berries but there are no reviews on that one yet. I think it is a great mix with all kinds so some super sour candy and some not so sour but still good candy. It is great for someone like me who wanted to try out some different things but didn't want to have to buy them all.

review/summary: Still My Favorite
review/text: I used to love these cough drops when I was a kid. I haven't seen them in stores for a while, so I decided to order them from Amazon.com. They definitely have a slight medicinal taste, so it's obvious that they aren't just candy. Luden's drops contains 1.7mg of pectin, which, according to the box is an "oral demulcent" (mouth/throat soother). The only thing that would make these drops better would be the removal of red dye #40 and blue dye #2. They're the only drops that my son won't spit out, so I would recommend them for kids over three years of age, as well as adults.

review/summary: Tonkatsu Wa Oishii Da Yo! Daisuki!
review/text: I learned to love Bull Dog Tonkatsu sauce while I was living in Japan. There was a small deli/grill just outside my local train station that sold set meals of tempura and tonkatsu. (For those who may not know, tonkatsu is a breaded, deep fried pork cutlet. The sauce is designed to garnish this delicacy.) I used to pick some up on my way home from work, stamping my feet to keep warm as I trudged up the interminable hill that led to my apartment. I bought this sauce at the local grocery store and kept it on hand for just such occasions!<br /><br />To the previous reviewer who compared the flavor to that of nutmeg: Bravo! you almost nailed it:) I have a home made version of tonkatsu sauce I cobble together as a clone. It calls for a significant amount of allspice and clove, as well as a generous splash of sake. If you Google for recipes you can experiment yourself, if you're so inclined. But then, the good folks over at Bull Dog may object to my counter productive views--sorry folks! :)<br /><br />In closing, I want to urge you to visit Japan and try tonkatsu for yourselves! I had a wonderful time during the two years I lived there! Here's a treasure hunt for you: there is a restaurant specializing in tonkatsu to be found on the top floor of the mall that encompasses the bullet train station in Kyoto. Give that place a try for an unbeatable taste of Japanese cuisine; the view is fantastic! I recommend it highly. Bon appetit!:)

review/summary: Classic sauce for all poultry
review/text: I pretty much grew up using bull dog sauce in Japan.  Has a consistency of salad dressing with teriyaki like taste but little more zing.  Kids love it and everyone that tried this sauce was amazed at how good it is.  It goes well with steak, chicken, pork or tonkatsu (breaded fried pork cutlet) and just about anything you can imagine.<br /><br />It does go very well with tonkatsu; panko breaded fried pork cutlets.  It's amazing.  The Japanese will eat with Bulldog sauce but also if you like curry rice, you can use tonkatsu and make it into katsu-curry which is another classic Japanese dish.<br /><br />I know I know, it has HFCS but it sure beats plain and boring A1 steak sauce (though I do use it sometimes but mix different sauce!).  Not to mention like I said, you can use this sauce like teriyaki (or BBQ) sauce with anything so definitely try it out!

review/text: My first exposure to Bulldog was when first meeting my future husband's family in NH. Went for dinner to the local Japanese restaurant & everyone raved that I had to try the Bulldog. Not being a sauce fan, I hesitated, but finally put some on my rice. It was very subtle & not overpowering. Didn't take long to become a fan!<br /><br />Every visit we make to his family, we have to buy more Bulldog (sometimes 3 & 4 bottles, not knowing when we'd get to visit again..would be horrible to run out). For whatever reason, we can't find it in our local stores.<br /><br />It's really good as a marinade - I've used it with chicken, beef & pork. It works when cooking on the grill, on the stove, or in the crockpot.  It's my "secret ingredient" in beef stew, and it's really good on plain ramen noodles too. I'll have to try putting it on mashed potatoes, as another reviewer mentioned. Sounds good!<br /><br />I'm so happy I can buy Bulldog at Amazon...Huge savings over what it costs at the restaurant, and it's delivered to my door...gotta love it.<br /><br />I'd seriously be surprised if someone were to try this & not like it.

The name means "head of the shop"--it's a blend of up to 100 spices and every place has a slightly different formula. With all six, we got a mild, aromatic, subtly perfumy seasoning with a tremendous depth of flavor. We love it on steamed lamb shanks. It has an outstanding affinity for whole roast chicken: brush melted butter all over the chicken, then coat generously with ras el hanout and a little salt and pepper. Roast at 365� for 1 hour and 45 minutes, turning it over after the first hour. Fabulous! Ras el hanout is about the same color as cumin. (See the article in Wikipedia for info on the main ingredients.)<br /><br />We were sorry to find out that this product is nothing like the real deal. We bought it because our Morocco stash is running out. It looks and tastes like ordinary curry powder, including a fair amount of hot chili pepper, not at all like ras el hanout. We threw it out. Don't waste your money.

review/summary: Has a powerful effect on the brain.
review/text: After listening to the commercials I bit and bought the 5 Hour Energy drink. I tried it out just last week. Believe me, this is powerful stuff. It's not just the caffeine that has an effect on you. There are other ingredients that also alter the chemistry of the brain.<br /><br />We've mentioned caffeine. Big deal. You drink a cup of coffee and you'll get the equivalent amount, which is about 100 mg. Compared to a lot of energy drinks that's relatively mild. 5 Hour Energy makes a decaffeinated energy drink too, so we have to assume that the real effects don't rely on the caffeine. And it's about time. All caffeine really does is substitute one state of poor concentration (sleepy) with another (jittery). Other ingredients help to increase concentration and some even act as mood stabilizers. Still others are nutrients and vitamins.<br /><br />But that's theory. The real world effects are another story. I tried 5 Hour Energy after a sleepless night. After taking just one shot, which is really the maximum recommended dose, I felt awake, alert and ready to face the day. BUT as the day went on there were other effects. I noticed that my concentration was improved using this drug even more so than with Adderall. (So if you're ADD like me, you could possibly self-medicate with 5 Hour Energy. Just make sure none of this gets out to Big Pharma.)<br /><br />Unfortunately it had some unwelcome effects. I felt as if there was a dynamo spinning constantly in my head. My thoughts started to race. I was worried, briefly, but convinced myself that the sensation would go away, and it did after just 15-30 minutes.<br /><br />I now think that 1/2 to 2/3 of a bottle may be the best dose for me. I'm not a fan of inebriation, but I could clearly identify a brief "high" and a slow letdown period that has surely gotten plenty of twentysomethings addicted to this drug.<br /><br />My advice? Use it wisely. Don't underestimate it because it's small. Whatever you do, don't drink more than one in a 3 hour period or two in a day - so says the label, probably for good reason. And get your sleep if you can. Energy drinks aren't an excuse to not sleep.<br /><br />And again, let me be clear. This is a drug!

review/summary: Great Flavor and Energy
review/text: I really love the 5 hour energy drink in the berry flavor because not only does it give me the energy I need, but it has a great tasting natural flavor. I like that it is low in calories and the shot is easy to drink. Many energy drinks I have had taste terrible, but this drink has a nice and fruity berry flavor. I first used this at work during the afternoon when I needed a boost of energy to get through the day, and I am glad I chose it because it gave me the energy I needed without an energy crash at the end. I like that I get a mental boost from the drink, it helps me wakeup in the morning and be more alert. I use this in the afternoons, mornings and when going out at night with friends. It doesn't give me the jitters or big caffeine crash like coffee or soda and the energy lasts a few hours. This is my new favorite energy drink and I love the flavor.  I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360.

review/summary: Great flavor - great for chili and clam chowder
review/text: Where I live, this is hard to find at the supermarkets.  But, trust me, its well worth the added expense to buy on-line.  It should last a long time as just a few drops is very potent but not too hot.  I was first introduced to these flavors added to clam chowder.  Clam chowder should never be served without this!!  Now I add it to chili, or other dishes for extra hot spice occasionally.  Best to add it just before serving as the sherry flavor dissapates relatively quickly.

Amazon should require sellers to have an at least minimal reasonable description of the product being sold.

review/summary: Wonderful but pricey
review/text: I've been using white truffle oil as a healthy alternative to butter for about a year. I also like to buy organic products. This product has the delightful mild flavor of a fine Italian white truffle oil, with the added benefit of being organic. I use it to heat up rice, cook fresh or frozen vegetables and it's great on popcorn. Fortunately, because of its high cost, a little bit goes a long way. Once you open it, be sure and keep it refrigerated as it will spoil quickly. refrigerating will cause it to thicken but that's easily resolved by microwaving it for 20 seconds or putting the closed bottle in hot water. If you microwave it, be sure and cut off the little metal ring that the is the bottom of the bottle cap. It's easily removed with scissors. I also, for environmental reasons, like that it's packaged in glass and not plastic. For some ideas on how to use truffle oil you may want to check out the book "Truffles: Ultimate Luxury, Everyday Pleasure <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E97X0M">Truffles: Ultimate Luxury, Everyday Pleasure</a> by Rosario Safina, the owner of the company that makes this particular truffle oil. I've not read the book or even looked at it but it's been reviewed byt 12 people at Amazon and ten people gave it five stars. The two people that gave it a bad review can be considered as outliers. One reviewer gave the book one star because he or she never got it from Amazon. That's a merchant complaint and not a product complaint. The other negative review stated that there were spelling and typographical errors and that was the sole purpose for the bad review. The ten remaining reviewers all give the book five stars so it's probably worth looking into if you're looking for ideas as to how to use truffle oil in a wider range of recipes.

review/summary: Fabulous Pizza Sauce
review/text: Hi Folks, I'm very surprised that no one has tried this sauce and felt moved to write a review.  I'll try and do it justice.  First you will notice the texture, it is lite, with chunks of tomato.  You get the feeling that you are the one making it, reducing the sauce but you stop before it goes too far.  The texture is unlike any other I have ever experienced.  Being use to the industrial blender smooth and heavy feel of typical commercial sauces I knew I was on to something when I first spread this one.  Once you've baked it up with you favorite topping you will absolutely melt when you taste it.  I said to myself, "where have you been all my life"?  Again the taste is lite and zesty, definitely say "hello, how do you like me now"!  I hope you will give it a try.  I plan on hunting down and trying their other sauces.  Good Luck and Enjoy!

Overall, this is an excellent product.

We make a dressing from 1 part Fini Red Wine Vinegar with 2 parts of Good quality Greek Extra Virgin Olive Oil (we are currently using Tasso), add a small amount of Agave sweetener, salt and pepper to taste.  It is delicious, especially on heirloom tomato and cucumber salad.

review/text: I love cider, but after a friend told me about this mulling spice I was hooked.  I tried to find it at my local store, but all I ended up getting was the kind you use like a tea bag.  It made the cider taste better, but it was nothing compared to the perfect ratio and consistency of Aspen mulling spice.  It will produce the same great tasting cider time after time, whereas the tea bag style varied too much in it's taste and strength.  I won't go another holiday season without Aspen mulling spice in my cider and of course a dash of bourbon.

review/text: I have celiac disease and must adhere to a very strict gluten free diet. I routinely travel the extra distance to shop at the area health food stores which carry this item.  I am thrilled to have finally found this item on line at a more reasonable price. This oatmeal is fantastic and now I am able to eat it daily with no problem. I was at first suspicious that it might not truly be a gluten free item because it is so tasty and is the exact consistency of the traditional Quaker Oats, so I called the company to check the lot number of the package. The company rep was informative and assured me the lot numbers were their product. She even told me that they had recently improved their milling process to make this product easier to microwave and cook with. I am so thankful for this oatmeal as a gluten free diet is very restrictive and I had not eaten oatmeal for 12 years  because there was not a gluten free oatmeal on the market.

The oats come inside a resealable plastic bag inside the box, so there is little risk of cross contamination in the pantry.  (I've had problems with another gluten-free oat brand that sells on Amazon, where the boxes were quite leaky with oats floating everywhere, and there was no plastic bag.)

Before these oats, we were eating Bob's Red Mill gluten free oats; however, we found the Cream Hill Estates to have fewer hulls and cooks to a smoother texture, overall.

review/text: I am a coffee fanatic, but I recently gave up caffiene (even decaf) so I was looking for an alternative. A friend recommended Teeccino and I will NEVER go back to regular coffee again!  This stuff is AMAZING! It satisfies all the cravings I had for coffee and it is rich and smooth enough to drink black. The TEE bags are so convenient, but if you prefer to brew your coffee the bags of coffee work just as well.  I highly recommend for those who love coffee, but need to cut back on caffeine.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: One of my healthier decisions was to cut down on coffee. I'm a tea drinker, but sometimes I just want something more coffee like. I ordered a sampler pack of Teeccino tea bags awhile back and found my favorites, Hazelnut and Vanilla Nut. The tea bags make it super easy to take this anywhere or use at home with easy clean up. I steep mine for 5 minutes and sometimes add almond milk or just drink it black. There are dried dates in Teeccino so it does have a slightly sweet flavor and 12 calories per bag (according to my box). This is a really great value, you're getting 50 tea bags!

review/text: I had to kick the caffeine addiction due to headaches I was having within 18 hours of not having any. I love strong coffee and can drink it black. Teeccino isn't that strong. It is not acidic. But I do love the taste and can drink it plain or with a dab of cream and sweetener. The individual bags are great. All the flavors in a sample pack I got were good, but Vanilla Nut, Hazelnut, and Chocolate are what I'm back for today. I can still enjoy a warm comforting drink with the same feel as coffee without worrying about the addicting qualities.

review/text: I ordered this wonderful coffee last night through my Prime Amazon two-day shipping, so I was more than pleasantly surprised to see the package already waiting for me at home when I came back from work today. I immediately brewed a pot, and I cannot describe how delicious it smells and tastes!!! I was planning on using it with almond milk, but after having a sip I decided to have it pure black - it is that good!!! I agree with the other reviewers that this is not a coffee substitute for people addicted to syrupy coffee drinks from Starbucks. It is really much better and healthier for you. I follow the alkaline diet, and was thrilled to find this product. I can honestly say it exceeded my expectations. I love the price too. I will definitely be ordering more of this flavor, and will try new ones as well. Thank you Teeccino and thank you Amazon! :)

review/summary: Easy to make and smells great
review/text: I like to drink Yogi Tea- Mayan Cocoa Spice Tea, and I went to a different natural food store and asked about it but they no longer stock it, so I was recommended this brand instead, the mint one or the mocha, but they were out of stock of that too, but I was interested so she recommended this and it comes in a convenient tea bag for single serve cups, (no over priced pod machine needed) which I like a lot because I would rather make a mug than a whole pot but I might buy some of that too to make bigger batches for iced drinks in the summer. The smell is amazing, its very smooth, tastes great (though I can't taste a coffee taste its a good hot drink) and isn't irritating on my stomach, I don't do the greatest with real black hot coffee, I do better with cappuccino or iced coffee drinks (I've always assumed it was because its diluted down some with milk and stuff) but it still has a tendency to give me stomach cramping but this didn't.

My poor sis was so embarrassed by the quality of the items she went to Bath and Body Works to supplement it.  It needed more items like shampoo, bath oils or even bubble bath.  A body scrub with the two loofahs would have been nice.  I could have done without all the aromatherapy stuff they put in the CARDBOARD "basket" - really, for $40 bucks?  Cardboard?  Overall, I'd rate this a poor buy and I would never give it as a present - well, maybe I would if they priced it at $5.00 and it was a Secret Santa gift!

review/summary: Better than any commercial oatmeal cookie
review/text: After hearing about these legendary cookies and being unable to procure them in my benighted corner of the US, I finally located fresh stock at "All Things Bright and British" in La Mesa, California (near San Diego). I now wish I had also bought the non-chocolate variety for comparison and will since the shop is nearby.<br />Let me say that for my taste these are truly excellent. Certainly they may be too sweet for some tastes, and I agree with another reviewer that for dunking into hot beverages the coating will melt. (But dunking into cold milk might be interesting.) In fact, keep them out of hot weather as the type of chocolate coating is not hard.<br />But for taste these are far superior to any Keebler, Nabisco, etc. cookie of this style and only cookies from small, quality bakeries can compare. If you can get your hands on a package and enjoy a crunchy, oaty, delicious cookie by all means give these a try.<br />What's most amazing is that even with the chocolate coating, the calories and fat are very low for a fairly large cookie, and each has 1 gm of fiber. I don't have all the numbers to array, but I am sure that the Hob Nobs would beat their commercial equivalents in all categories (not, of course, that you eat cookies for health!)<br />For price comparison: I paid $4 for a 9 oz tube in early 2009. Definitely not something I'm going to buy all the time, but a worthwhile treat.

review/text: Do you like McVitie's digestive biscuits? If you do, you'll love this. It's a rougher and fuller version of it with chocolate on one side. McVitie's digestive biscuits already come in chocolate form, but the Hobnobs biscuits seem to be a more intense version of them. If you want a less intense flavor, then choose the regular digestive biscuit chocolate version. It's filling and just tastes great. There is no American counterpart of these kind of biscuits so you'll be in for a real treat if you like intense biscuits. I just love them.

review/summary: A coating too far
review/text: This jumped-up cookie-wannabe really is taking things a little too far. McVitie's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VJD5LQ">Hobnobs</a> are already a mite sweeter than many British biscuits and many believe that they already pander a little too much to modern American-influenced tastes ever to truly qualify as a proper biscuit. To add a coating of milk-chocolate (which melts as soon as you try to dunk one) to such a confection is really taking things altogether too far, producing a sickly mismatch of tastes and textures that will appeal only to the young of pallet. Or, perhaps, to the glutton (who will want the 12-pack).<br /><br />Perhaps the final clue that this was never intended for a British market is to be found in the fact that McVitie have here dispensed with the modest paper wrapper of a "proper" packet of biscuits and chosen to sell these items in a plastic tube.  Hmmm...

review/text: Thinking these would be good for an upcoming backpacking trip, we gave them a try. At the first bite, we were overwhelmed by the chemical taste of artificial butter flavor. We hardly ever throw food away, but we scraped these potatoes off our plates into the trash and sliced some bread to fill the resulting empty space.<br /><br />Years ago we had a wilderness culinary debacle involving freeze dried beef stew that reminded us of vomit. These potatoes weren't quite that bad, but I'm still glad that we didn't get stuck eating the whole package on some mountaintop because there was nothing else.<br /><br />If you've always wished you could have movie popcorn for dinner, you might like them.

The glass is really sturdy and can take many falls on the ground, no breaking yet. I don't think you need to hassle with bottle sleeves either. Be sure to get extra nipples, especially for level 1, since in time the hole may open wider to release too much milk.

review/text: We bought the Born Free glass bottles after much research. I knew that I absolutely wanted to use glass over plastic, as glass is non-porous and non-reactive, and I am concerned about the levels of chemicals that our children are consuming through the leaching of plastics--even "safe" ones. The bottles arrived (we bought both the 9oz. and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COBH5A">Wide Neck Glass Bottle 5 Ounces</a>). I boiled them to sanitize, and we introduced bottles at 5 weeks. Baby took to them right away, without a problem, and four months later is still able to switch between bottle and breast very easily. The bottles come fully apart and are easy to clean, and he has never had a problem with gas or colic or ear infections related to the bottle. I even froze breast milk in them for a little while when I ran out of storage bags. These were a great purchase.

Level 2 is too slow for my 7 month old, but level 3 is way too fast causing him to swallow a lot of air and choke. I am beginning to hate these bottles even more. Also, there are a ton of different pieces to wash and they are over priced. This is the one time buying things based on the rave reviews didn't work out.

Fortunately her caretaker was quick enough to get her out of the way but not before a piece of glass cut her foot.  I am so angry, something much worse could have happened.  I filed a report on this brand of glass bottle with the National Consumer Safety Commission.

review/summary: Old Fashioned Comfort Food
review/text: I bought 2 dozen cans when it was on sale at my local natural food store.  I wound up eating it every single day for 24 days in a row!  It is very creamy with tons of chunks of mushroom soup.  I also chop up some fresh mushrooms, parsely and a little garlic to "pump it up".  The soup is just fine as it is from the can, but what can I say but that I am totally addicted to mushrooms since they are very low calorie, high in fiber and are a good source of Vitamin B! The soup has quite a high ratio of little mushroom bits, but I like to add some of my own fresh mushrooms to add to the texture.<br /><br />  On a cold winter day it makes a great "comfort food" Reminds me of homemade soup - very healthy ingredients.  This is a stape in my house and I order it regularly through Amazons "Super Saver" - can't beat this deal, 15% DISCOUNT plus free shipping - why bother to go to the market when it can be delivered to your door?<br /><br />Although the directions on the can say to add milk or cream it isn't at all necessary.  The soup in the can is really creamy already.<br /><br />I like to eat this soup with some whole wheat toast.  This makes a nice little healthy snack.

review/summary: NOT gluten free and not really soy-free
review/text: I am allergic to soy. I bought a case of this soup, thinking I could share the case with two friends who are gluten intolerant. WRONG! The description says "Contains no soy, Contains no GMO's, Contains gluten", and I simply read it wrong, adding a 'no' in front of the gluten. Looking through the reviews, I'm not the only one who made this mistake. Luckily I can keep the rest of the soup for myself, so it wasn't a total waste. It's not an amazing soup, I don't know that I'd want to eat it by itself, but it's good for what I need it for - a soy-free cream of mushroom soup that I can use in casseroles, etc. For that, it's great!<br /><br />IMPORTANT EDIT: After using this soup for a few months, I started having a reaction to it. The Amy's brand is vegetarian and uses a lot of soy in their foods, and either through cross-contamination or a change of formula, I can no longer eat it (or any of the Amy's soups) without having a bad reaction. If you are very sensitive to soy, be aware!!

review/summary: I feel it's too good to waste in recipes
review/text: I got these to use in recipes.<br /><br />I was really hungry one day, and didn't have time, so I just poured a can in a bowl and microwaved it. I didn't add anything (I didn't read the instructions that say to add 1/4 can milk).<br /><br />It was unbelievably good (it smelled great too, smelled like a whole meal). Now I feel bad using it in anything because it's so good by itself.
