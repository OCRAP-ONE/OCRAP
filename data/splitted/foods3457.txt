review/summary: Very good.  Also, they smell like potatoes.
review/text: I really shouldn't complain:  the world would be a sadder place without these.  They are like gluten-free Kitkats, which is wonderful.<br /><br />However, they also smell like potatoes.  The chocolate covers the potato taste and smell, for the most part, but, it's still a little bit like eating chocolate-covered crispy potatoes.<br /><br />However, as you are probably aware, there are variations in what people can taste and smell.  Personally, I can tell what vodka was made from--potatoes, wheat, whatever--even though it's so finely distilled that there shouldn't be any way to distinguish that.  If you're not super-sensitive to tastes and smells, you probably won't notice the potato at all, in which case, these would be fabulous.

review/summary: It's good junk food.  They also smell like potatoes.
review/text: First, let me say that I love this company.  They have somehow managed, with very difficult flours, to make normal junk food.  (These kinds of cookies are sold in American supermarkets in packages that are three times the size.)<br /><br />The packaging is pretty;  the cookies are crispy, light, and very appealing in your hand.  They are an exact duplicate of the wheat version.  However, once you get them up to your nose, you can smell the potato flour they are made from.<br /><br />Pull them away from your nose, and you have a very pretty cookie.  Bring them back in to your nose, and it's a surreally icky potatoey experience.  Cookies like this shouldn't smell like potato vodka.<br /><br />They do have a chocolate-covered version of this that you can't really smell, because the flour is covered. It's such a sugar rush that you may not care what it tastes like, particularly because it has an excellent chocolate-sugar-bomb wafer cookie texture.<br /><br />Just hold your nose.

review/summary: Beware of Glutino
review/text: My son and I who are both Celiacs loved Glutino wafers in both chocolate and dark chocolate varieties. We were on our 3rd box when I opened one of the bars and went to bite into it. It was the equivalent to biting into some sort of spongy rock. I immediately spit out what chocolate had fallen into my mouth while biting it. The bar itself seemed extremely stale to me. I went ahead and opened the remaining 3 bars in the box and the rest were normal. I also noted on the package that the product is made in Israel then processed in Canada, then sent to USA to be bought. It seems to me like one of the bars I had floated around a facility for quite some time before it was actually packaged and sent. Or worse who knows. I'm glad it was me and not my 3 year old son who bit into it.<br /><br />I tried contacting Glutino about what happened. I tried calling several times as well as sent messages via the internet. But no response. It went from being suspicious to down right scary, what are they hiding and if this is how they treat their costumers- how do they treat their food?<br /><br />Please be forewarned. Going gluten free isn't easy and Glutino is a big brand on the celiac's grocery list but since our incident we avoid Glutino at all costs.

review/summary: Delicious cookies, but not single serving packs
review/text: Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid. I don't feel that I can do that with these.

review/text: These don't taste like cardboard, thankfully; they have a pleasant, subtle almost nutty flavor, as if peanut butter is in them. However, the texture, even in the center of the cookie, is not moist at all!! I was hoping the outside would be slightly crunchy while the inside was softer and moist. They also crumble easily. They are alright but nothing I'd purchase again.

review/text: This was another great find on Amazon Grocery!! They are very tasty, crunchy little cookies.  My family has really enjoyed these, they have a great mild chocolate taste and quite the crunch.  Most of the animal crackers/cookies that I've purchased for my family have become dismembered sometime before my children get them out of the package, these are mostly whole and you can really tell what the critter is before you pop it in your mouth ... Extra fun snack time for the little ones.  All in all, the box of cookies is well worth the price and I feel good about packing healthier snacks in my children's backpacks for school.

review/summary: THE Best Healthy Cookies Out There!
review/text: These chocolate chip cookies are addicting! They are the best tasting cookies out there, and they are healthy for you too! They are crisp, fresh, and have an even amount of chocolate vs cookie flavor. They are not animal crackers by any means.<br /><br />The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you have them delivered to some place cool (not to your door step on a hot July day!) as one batch came out a little not-so-crisp, and I'm pretty sure it was because of that.<br /><br />These cookies are almost twice as expensive in the stores where I live if I buy them by the bag. Forget that! I'm sticking with them here on Amazon!<br />Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Did the recipe change?
review/text: I notice that the most positive reviews are from a few years ago, and the most negative reviews are more recent.  We used to buy these in larger containers at the local "healthy supermarket," and my family really liked them.  That was a few years ago.  Now, they sit in the back of the pantry and no one touches them--either the recipe changed or my family's tastes changed.  They are dry, about half of them are broken, and they taste like sweetened cardboard.  (We have the vanilla variety.)  The individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks, but I've noticed that they frequently come back unopened.  Guess I'll look for an alternative.

review/summary: VEGANS BEWARE - These contain milk.
review/text: These are delicious and actually have pieces of peanut butter in them. Crunchy but still creamy, and so yummy. However, I didn't check the ingredients before purchasing and assumed that - like the Vanilla, Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal - these would be vegan. They're not - they have whey and milk powder in them. For a non-vegan, these taste great and are a more healthy choice than your standard cookie.<br /><br />For the calorie counters: these have almost 50% more calories per serving than the other Snackimals flavors. Most of the other flavors are 110 calories per 10 cookie serving, and the Peanut Butter are 150 calories per 10 cookie serving.

review/summary: So good!...........
review/text: One of my carry-over faves from childhood is animal crackers.  I love them.  I'll have to admit I am a big fan of organic items and also am a sucker for clever/cute packaging, so I brought these home tonight to give them a whirl.  Delicious!  These are not a thick animal cracker like nabisco, but a thin crunchy one.  The peanut butter tastes just like a peanut butter cookie should and is not overly sweet.  The package is 7.5 oz and carries 7 servings of 10 cookies for 150 calories (25 from fat).  1 g saturated fat, 2g fiber, 10 g sugar, 3g protein and 2% calcium, and 4% iron.  All natural ingredients, with natural peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils, artificial flavors, additives or preservatives.  I would feel fine eating these or giving to a kid for a sweet snack.  The first ingredients on the label?  Organic unbleached flour and peanut butter.<br /><br />I'm very happy I tried these and will definitely try more of the other cookies in this brand's line.<br /><br />Overall a delicious product, well packaged in a convenient resealable bag.  Perfect for car trips, home or office.  Now you can indulge and feel slightly better about it!

I'm leery of having snacks around and I'm not too fond of having the kid eat a lot of snacks, but my wife assures me that these are relatively healthy snacks. Hmmmmm. I suspect that these are just as much for her as for the boy. Well, what can you do? We already have them and the bag is open. I might as well try one just to see what they're all about. Mmmmmm. Somewhat dry and crunchy. Nice chocolatey taste, but not too heavy. Sweet, but only lightly sweet. Nice snack or treat! Of course, the boy loves them! I'm going to have problems staying away from these.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I like the ingredients and packs are big enough to share with another person.  I bought based on good reviews and found them to be crispy and delicious.  They taste like those little animal crackers you find in the small, red, zoo-like boxes with the string handles I had as a child but these are crispier and better ingredients.  I didn't sense the chocolate chip in the flavor but they are good. Recommend! :)<br /><br />EDIT:  Tried the Oatmeal flavor and was sadly disappointed..2 stars from me. The taste was bland and nothing exceptional for the over-the-top cost.  PLUS...Amazon only lets you review ONE FLAVOR even if you try others.  Obnoxious and deceptive...makes all flavors look 5 star when they are NOT.

review/text: My son has a ton of allergies and there are so few things he can have that are not homeade.  These cookies however have made the list for snack food he can eat being that they are free of peanuts, wheat, soy, treenuts and more.  I have not found an animal cracker on the market that is free of all those allergens.  usually they at least have soy. the bigger deal for me though is that these things are GOOD! I tried them and love them.  I don't eat them of course but the majority of the allergy free food I try of my sons, i dont' really like.  I'd never eat them more than once. these though I coudl definately.  My other son loves them too. It is so great to find a snack food for a small child with allergies that he can take to school and be like every one else.

review/text: These cookies are amazinggg. Theyre like 10 times tastier than the regular wheat animal crackers that come in the little boxes.<br />The animals they make are the elephant, the lion, the bear(my favorite), the zebra, a camel, a furry cat, a circus cart, something im pretty sure is a fox, a monkey and a hippo.<br />The cookies are a lovely snack and there is just the right amount in the bag. I will definitely buy these again.

review/summary: Really tasty cookies despite confusing reviews
review/text: I'm not sure if there was a bad batch of these sent out in 2011 or something, but the bag I bought for my son on 5/27/12 was really quite good. If you're familiar with the Nature Valley Oat and Honey granola bars, the oatmeal Barbara's Snackimals taste almost exactly like those, only they're much neater to eat and easier to chew since they're thinner and smaller. Yes, the cookies have a tendency to break, but they taste *great*. My son (2 1/2) loved them, and even his two cousins (6 and 2 1/2), who get more sugary treats than he did, helped to demolish the bag. All the adults were a bit jealous, I think--the Snackimals were much tastier than our potato chips . . .

review/text: The Barbara's snackimals are an unexpected surprise.<br />These cookies come in a 2 servings per bag package at 2.25oz each which in perspective is more mass than a 99cent bag of chips at Subway et al. So relatively satisfying portion if eating as intended, 1 bag at a time.<br /><br />Delicious oaty flavor, tasting of molasses and vanilla, 2 of their few ingredients, these cookies are crispy.  Yet they chew down to goo just like the old-fangled animal crackers with the carnival packaging.<br /><br />I feel good about buying them, relatively snacking, and I feel good about consuming them, again, relatively speaking.<br />Recommended in all ways, no drawbacks that I have discovered yet.

review/text: Being a natural, somewhat healthy cookie, I expected a carob-y cardboard flavor.  Not so!  While you can see very small specks of chocolate, I think most of the chocolate flavor comes from the pale brown swirls throughout the cookie.  The chocolate is far more flavorful than you would imagine.  They are simply wonderful, cute little cookies.

review/text: These are great animal crackers. My kids all love them. It's great to have a portable snack that my chemically-sensitive kids can eat. These are going to be great to bring on picnics, to the park, on car trips, etc.<br /><br />The biggest quibble I have is that the "snack-size" bags are a little too large for younger kids (pre-schoolers or kindergartners) to finish at one sitting. If I send a bag in with my kindergartner for snack time, even though he loves them he can't finish them all. About 1.5 oz would be plenty for young kids.<br /><br />Ironically, they are cheaper per ounce in the snack size bags than in the larger boxes. You'd expect it to be the other way around.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of these.

review/summary: Good quality product, but the flavor is not what I had hoped
review/text: First, this is a good quality product: they use quality ingredients and the crackers have a nice "animal cracker" crunchy texture. Flavor is such a subjective thing that I hate to down-rate a high quality product too much just on that basis. But I won't be ordering any more of these.<br /><br />My oldest son says they don't have enough cinnamon to achieve a strong cinnamon flavor, but too much to achieve just a hint of cinnamon flavor. I think they actually have the right amount of cinnamon, but aren't quite sweet enough, especially on the exterior. They just come across a little bit bland. I know a lot of people say that is just because people are used to over-sweetened foods, but I think the chocolate chip flavor Snackimals have just the right amount of sweetness. In any case, my kids don't like them - but they do like the chocolate chip flavor.

review/summary: Best Animal Cookies!
review/text: I've been eating these for a couple of years now as they used to sell them in an organic supermarket I worked near.  They're extremely tasty and way better for you than most other cookies.  You would never know it was a healthier choice.  Now don't get me wrong, it's not replacing your veggies for the day or anything but it's definitely a smart snack choice when you're craving sweet... and the kind of snack you get hooked on!  It's also a great option for kids and even comes in snack packs for their lunches!

review/summary: Great snack, good ingredients, healthy alternative
review/text: So far we have tried vanilla, oatmeal and chocolate chip varieties of Barbara's Snackimals and like all of them.  Ingredients are quite good and per bag price is very reasonable--even more so on auto-delivery.  Large 2+ ounce single servings are quite satisfying when you want something slightly sweet and crunchy with only 120 calories and modest fat content. The only change we have made to our auto-delivery schedule is to have them shipped more frequently.

review/summary: Flavor Not What I Was Expecting
review/text: I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor.

review/text: Look, each pack contains two servings of 120 cal each, yet those servings serve up exactly zero taste.  They should make it one serving of the same number of calories but inject some taste.  They taste like someone forgot 1) salt and 2)sugar.  Wow.  Super bad.

review/summary: dissapointed
review/text: not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money.

review/text: planters has this NUT-rition line of nuts for everything from heart health to men's health.  i'm not sure all the different options make all the differences they claim or if this is a marketing scam to charge more for something that is "specialized".  either way, the nuts are very good.  i enjoy the combination of almonds, peanuts and pistachos.  the ratio seems about equal, maybe with a bit more peanuts than anything else.  low carbs at 5g and there is sea salt added.  overall, very tasty and recommended even if you're not a man.

review/summary: great cereal
review/text: I'm totally addicted to this cereal, and have been eating it for years. It has just the right level of sweetness, and none of the non-oat filler that I hate (puffed rice, flax seed, etc) that are common in "grocery store" brands.  The raisins are generally soft enough to not feel like pebbles, unlike some other brands.<br /><br />However, beware: As of this review, it is far cheaper to get this product elsewhere.  I wish Amazon would start selling it again at a competitive price, as I would much rather buy it from Amazon.

review/summary: Been loving this cereal for over 35 years!
review/text: When I was in my early teens, I discovered Heartland granola cereal with raisin.  It was the only cereal of its' type at the time.  I absolutely loved the taste of the granola and molassas in this cereal, and there were always plenty of sweet and plump raisins in the box.<br /><br />I haven't seen this cereal in any of my local grocery stores in over 20 years.  I have eaten many other "natural" cereals over the years that I enjoyed, but none as much as Heartland.<br /><br />I decided to Google it the other day.  I was pleased to see that this cereal is still made today.  I purchased a case on Amazon.com and received it today.  I opened it immediately and ate a huge bowl right away.  The cereal tastes exactly like I remember!  I still love it and am so happy that I can enjoy it once again!

review/text: Im becoming quite a granola connoisseur, and this granola was not the best but not the worst. From the cover it looks like you will be getting nice golden granola, but then when you open the box it didn't look golden. It does have an ok taste. Not sure though really what it is im tasting. All i know is its a little sweet. It has more sugar than even the chocolate granola i use to have, dont know how they managed that. To me it is just an ok granola nothing real spectacular when it comes to taste and looks. Raisins aren't that bad either.

review/summary: Kitten chow gets gobbled up
review/text: This is one of two canned kitten food I feed my kittens. Boy when I put this down, one of my kitties nearly inhaled it. Both are rescues, and one I'm sure has been given table scraps. They are only two months and six-weeks old respectively. Hard as it is to believe, their numbers were up at the pound so I took them both.<br /><br /> My first time with this food was for my now-year-old rescue kitty. She was so fussy and I suspect from being fed table scraps. But she ate this. Her tastes have since outgrown it. But for my two new rescue kitties, this is a tasty and healthy meal. It is an expensive food, but is made well, with nutrients and like all good cat and kitten food, filling with staying power. I figure I'm saving money because they're eatig it, licking the bowl clean and nothing is going down the garbage.<br /><br /> I like they come in two kinds: one for baby kittens, the very young. And one for kitten a little older. The one with the chucks got gobbled down. Glad to find this at Amazon.

review/text: There are many reasons I'd love some kind of cat-human translator. Hearing their food preferences sits pretty low on that list, since I imagine they love all food. This food in particular, they seem to really love. Coming from the 'baby' version of this brand, we've upgraded from mush to chunks, which must make them feel like real cats. Our fat kitten devours his, while our skinny skittish kitten eats most of it, then tries to bury the rest with imaginary dirt he scrapes together from around the bowl.<br />2 paws up!

review/summary: Really good food
review/text: We adopted a 5 week old abandoned kitten from our local vet and they were feeding him canned Royal Canin kitten instinctive.  Though pricey it was manageable.  His orange coat was silky and he was thriving.  A month later I  rescued 2 other kittens from a shelter. Honestly, 3 kittens take up a lot of space in our smaller home.  And trying to afford this food for 3 ravenous kittens at $1.39 a can was a big hit to our limited budget. They were scarfing up 5 cans a day and begging for more. Out of necessity to our budget, I tried putting them on Friskies consoling myself with the thinking that at least they have a good home and are fed...Wow, big mistake!  Within hours the awful smell coming from the litter box was overwhelming.  My husband was not pleased and I was scooping the clumpable litter from the box 2-3 times a day. After a week and their loose stools not getting anybetter better I went back to Royal Cannin. I've just adjusted our budget so that our kitten clan can eat as well as their human folk. I pay more in food but worth it in my opinion since my house doesn't reak, the kittens love it, and their coats are like silk.  I've been able to save alittle money by getting a big plate and mixing 2 cans of kitten instinctive wet with 1/4-1/3 cup kitten instictive dry and sectioning it in 3 piles so each can have their section.  I do this in the morning and then again at night and have the Royal Canin dry left out during the day for snacking.  I also save money in litter since it is easier to clean with firm stools (not runny like some lower quality foods produce).
