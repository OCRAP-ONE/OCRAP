review/summary: Slightly fewer calories--much less flavor
review/text: These are for people that cannot tolerate sugar. They are not low cal, just slightly lower cal. The regular Coffee Rio Original Coffee Caramels made with sugar average 15 calories per piece or 60 calories per 17.3 grams, which is 4 pieces. The sugar free version averages 12.5 calories per piece or 50 calories per 16.5 grams, which about 4 pieces. Thatt's 20% fewer calories per piece.<br /><br />They are slightly softer as the regular Rios and much less sweet and much less flavorful. In terms of flovaor, there is no comparison -- the regular are rich; the sugarfree are bland, emphasis on the "bla". Eating these is a big sacrifice for 20% fewer calories. If you want to reduce caloric intake, the if you can work up the discipline to skip one piece for every 4 you eat, you total enjoyment might be much greater with the 20% fewer calories.<br /><br />They are made with real coffee and milk and Splenda sweetener, and other things.<br /><br />If you have partial fillings or crowns or braces, etc. you will want to avoid chewing these even though the are sotftler than the sugared version.<br /><br />For more general review on the Rio coffee candy, se my review of Coffee Rio Original Coffee Caramels.

review/summary: The Perfect Chai
review/text: I'm really picky about the chai tea I drink, and Yogi is the perfect cup of tea. I was very pleased to find it here in bulk - Trader Joe's seems to have ceased selling it. Apparently it was "too spicy" (this is what I found out from a friend's husband who works at one of the TJ's warehouses). To me, it's a perfect blend of heady spices, and it's not too overwhelming.

I would recommend you buy a single box at Whole Foods or some other store before you buy 6 boxes here.  You will appreciate the price at Amazon more and not get 'stuck' with tea that isn't to your taste.  Sweet Thai Basil is also good, as is the green tea chai from Yogi.

review/summary: Great
review/text: This will be short one, as most of Kristian Reg&aacute;le stuff is (delightfully!) similar.<br /><br />After finding a hidden cache of Kristian Reg&aacute;le we've been pounding through them, and I actually went back get another set!<br /><br />My wife made "My Dream Greek Pasta" (which was quite yummy) when we decided to try this. The color is similar to a light apple juice or some of the more translucent Chardonnays we've tried, with small bubbles just slowly trickling up. I noted both pear and apple on the nose.<br /><br />My first impression was positive. The pear taste is not as strong as the RW Knudsen's sparkling pear, and the carbonation is on par with the other Kristian Reg&aacute;le drinks I've tried, though it's a bit more mild than the Pomegranate, and much more mild than the Lingonberry. It's light bodied and the citrus acid gives it just a tiny acidic kick. Comparing only the taste, and not the carbonation, it's terribly dissimilar from Martinelli's.<br /><br />The mild, yet pleasant taste makes this easy to pair with. It'd go with many, many different foods, though especially with cold, light foods, like salads, pitas and hummus, or cheeses.<br /><br />Did I Like it: Yes, 7 out of 10. It will be a regular (or table drink) in our house now.

review/summary: best of the Wabash I tried
review/text: Went to the store in downtown Lake Placid. Bought a large bag of the extra-large caramel style, the red, and the purple. My wife and I agree the purple is the best. It is more dense and not chewy at all. It has a richer flavor. The red was second place, great but just not quite as good with poor popping. The extra-large was third. The extra-large was large and popped great, but it lacked the flavor and was slightly chewy. You could see that it would be great for caramel popcorn, but not for simple butter and sea-salt popcorn like we prefer. Still, they were all good.<br /><br />The correct way to pop: High heat on canola oil in a pot. Add 3 kernels. When they pop, add rest. Cover with spatter shield, this will keep the kernels in but let the steam out.<br />Enjoy!

It is the same variety as that sold as Fireworks brand Orchard Harvest, but seems to be a bit crisper after popping and the taste is better.  It is nearly hulless, smallish kernels, good flavor.  If you prefer "Orville Redenbacher" type flavor, this may not be the popcorn for you. Pops beautifully in a hot air popper.  We'll buy this again.

review/text: It pops into large kernels, but the flavor and texture of this popcorn just isn't as good as the Baby White from Amish. If you're looking for the perfect movie theater style popcorn, get the Baby White and skip this one. However, this popcorn isn't bad and I would prefer it over the grocery store Orville crap. I didn't have many unpopped kernels but this popcorn has fairly large hulls.

review/summary: eye popping results
review/text: This is excellent popping corn with a light rich flavor, it pops well, has significantly less hulls than most other popping corns we have tried, tastes great, and holds flavorings and cheese well. The popped corn is smaller than many other brands and we like the flavor better.<br />Cons:<br />The un-popped kernels are lighter than many other popping corns, so a few more get blown out un-popped by our hot air popper... towards the end when the number of kernels remaining to be popped in the air-popper gets low. If you don't mind having a few un-popped kernels it's works just fine in the air-popper.<br />The quantity of each order is bit large - twelve pounds at a time (you get six two pound packages per order) which  makes this premium corn price very competitive with lesser popping corns (when buying through Amazon.com).<br />We find the quantity not to be problem though, as we like this corn better than other corns we have tried, so we use it up faster. Of course dried corn keeps very well, and we have found that our friends love receiving a package or two when we visit, and it also makes a great remembrance gift for soldiers overseas, or college students away from home.

review/text: I bought this gourmet popping corn believing I was getting better than I can get a my local Trader Joe's... Wrong It was over priced, the shipping cost almost as much as the corn did and most of all the quality of the corn was terrible. The kernels were tiny and not fluffy when they did pop ...mostly they didn't pop. We could not wait to be done with this product! Also I asked to cancel the shipment before it was shipped because the shipping price was too high and still I got it.

It come in a plastic bag that is opened at the top, they closed it with a twist tie and nothing else to ensure a sealed closure of the popcorn, anyone can open it at anytime and then reclose it and you would never know it. I tossed it because I would worry if I let my 3 little one eat it that it was contaminated/tampered with.

Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original "Chips Ahoy!" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes.

review/text: Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.  If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these.  I'll stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie.

review/summary: Are We Reviewing Our Mistakes Or These Cookies?
review/text: Wow.  So far, two two-star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of "calms" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not "crispy" cookies, or the blurb would say "crispy," rather than "chewy."  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order.

Thank goodness for Amazon!<br />This seasoning mix is awesome with ground beef, chicken or my favorite, buffalo.  It's spicy enough for my husband, yet I like it too, even though I generally don't like hot food.  To me it has a very slight sweet taste and is like nothing I've found anywhere else. If there is any meat leftover after tacos, I'll make a taco salad for my lunch, which is just as good. Try it-you'll like it!

review/summary: Just GROSS...
review/text: I really wasn't expecting much. Just something relatively tasty and quick to make. I would normally steer clear of Chef Boyardee but the reviews were good as well as the price so I thought I would take a chance. I have no idea how this could have a 4.5 star rating, and I have to wonder what the culinary standards are across the US.<br /><br />Let's start with the sauce. First of all it's brown, thin, insipid, and lacking any tomato taste. There's some tasteless gristle in there that I guess is supposed to pass as meat. The ravioli themselves have a texture I've never before encounted in pasta. I have no idea how they hold together being that soft. I wasn't expecting al dente, but this is at the other extreme. It's mushy and slimy. It didn't even know there WAS a stage of pasta like this. It has no texture to it at all and becomes a gummy, pasty mess in the mouth. There looks to be generous filling but I have no idea what it's made of. The generous 'meat' filling shown got me to buy it but it has no taste of meat at all.<br /><br />I don't know how any mother with a conscience can feed this to her kids. I don't know how anyone with taste buds can feed this to themselves. There HAS to be better options than this for quick ravioli. There certainly can't be any worse ones!!!

Our kids our between 3-6... 2 out of 3 agree that it's a good product.  The other one?  Well, that's just how it works with multiple kids in one family. If we wanted 100%, we'd have had to have had only 1 child. At any rate, portion size seems good for our kids' ages. Only thing to watch, this things can literally hop in the microwave when cooking, so don't over cook.

review/summary: Just right for a light lunch or snack on the run
review/text: I really like these small bowls - they are the perfect size to toss in the overnight bag for a short trip. Pop it in the hotel's microwave for a small dinner and you've saved $5 to $10 that you would have wasted eating out. At home in 60 seconds you have a snack or meal on the run that tastes good and requires zero effort with zero cleanup afterward. I have just gotten into the habit of always keeping some of these around for visiting kids as well.

review/text: I have been buying this product for a few years so that my daughters could have a hot lunch at school. Though we could do without a little of the processed nature of the food, this has been really convenient to have on busy mornings. They love the raviolis. I love the price through Amazon and the ability to buy in bulk.

review/summary: Too Good to be microwave Ravioli
review/text: I bought these to try to get my girls to eat them instead of sugary junk food.  To set a good example I ate one first.  wow!  My girls never got a chance to try them.  I blew through them 2/day.  they are great the way the are, or add some parmesan after you cook them and they are even better!  I had to increase the cooking time to 1 minute to get them hot.  My new order is for 2 double sized and 2 single sized (still hoping my girls will try them)

review/text: I bought this product just because of the good reviews, while I was not expecting it to be the same as when making it 'from scratch', I thought I would be able to save some time from not having to cook.<br />Half of the bowl is sauce and the beef tastes really bad. Only good thing is the packing, ie the easiness to just put it in the microwave and eat. Not recommended from my taste.

review/text: If you need fast food, fairly decent food, then grab these by all means! They are absolutely great in a pinch and taste even better with a dab of butter melted on top.  Kids can toss these in the microwave and have a fairly decent lunch.  They taste great, hubbies love them too, although they probably need two to fill them up, along with a sandwich, and they're a decent value.  Recommend!

review/summary: Outstanding Tea
review/text: This has become one of my favorite teas - it is a delicious, smooth blend that requires no sugar. My husband even likes it. We've also found it to be an exceptional immune system booster. We've tried many different brands of echinacea capsules many times over the years, but this tea seems to be especially potent and quick-acting - maybe because it's a blend of 3 species of echinacea, and also includes astragalus & elderberry. It's a very enjoyable way to do something good for your body!

review/summary: Great Immune Booster, Yummy and Unusual Tasting Tea
review/text: *****<br /><br />This Echinacea Immune Support herbal tea from Yogi Tea is for the natural boosting of the immune system. It's an all natural tea made from organic peppermint leaf, organic ;lemon grass, organic Echinacea root (angustifolia, purprea, pallida), organic licorice root, organic cinnamon bark, organic spearmint leaf, organic fennel seed, organic lemon flavor, Echinacea purpurea root extract (phenols 12%), organic cardamom seed, organic rose hips, organic ginger root, organic burdock root, stevia leaf, organic mullein leaf, organic clove bud, astragalus root extract, organic black pepper, European elder berry extract (30% anthocyanins), natural cinnamon oil, natural cardamom oil, natural ginger oil. Whew! Lots of good ingredients!<br /><br />The taste is unusual and hard to define, probably because there are so many interesting ingredients. It is slightly tonic-y but very pleasant. I love all the things that these herbs are purported to do!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with Echinacea Immune Support and with Yogi Teas in general. Echinacea Immune Support comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Echinacea Immune Support tea is a superior blend of several species of Organic Echinacea Root (Echinacea angustifolia, purpurea, pallida) designed to boost your immune system. Each tea bag is made with organic Echinacea Root and Echinacea Root extract, containing the equivalent of 1,400 mg of Echinacea. Health practitioners for centuries have respected the powers of Echinacea, an herb that supports the body's natural defense system by stimulating production of immune system proteins, interferons, that regulate normal immune response. Furthermore, Echinacea supplies certain naturally-occurring plant compounds known as caffeic acid derivatives, including cichoric acid, alkylamides and polysaccharides. These work together to stimulate the body's immune system. The blend is complemented with Astragalus, a stamina-enhancing tonic that also boosts long-term immune function, and European Elder Berry, which is immune-enhancing and supports respiratory function. To support sinus function and promote clear breathing passages, Organic Peppermint and Organic Lemon Grass are included.* Finally, Organic Cinnamon , Organic Fennel, Organic Spearmint, and Organic Rose Hips add a wonderful fragrant essence to this delicious herbal supplement."<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. The box says, "When your immune system seems a bit down, drink 2 to 3 cups per day. For increased immune stimulation, drink 4 to 5 cups per day."<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal. Note that this review is for the six-pack of 16-count boxes, an excellent value overall. Compare it to other six-packs of this same tea on Amazon to make sure it's the best value, though, as they are always cheaper than buying the single boxes, but some are better deals than others.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: THE BEST I have found!
review/text: I have used this product for several years. I am diabetic and needed the additional immune system boost especially in the Winter time. Nobody wants cold or flu and I found that if I used this if I even thought I was getting sick it almost stopped it in it's tracks.  Sometimes I got a little achy from a cold but the cold did not last as long  nor was it as severe as it was without the tea.  My BF uses it now too, he has had the same experience with using it when you have just a beginning of a cold or flu...this stuff either knocks it out or at least deminishes it.  I thought the flavor was very good, almost sweet. It smells wonderful too :) I am not a sweetener user but this was good drinking hot or iced regardless if you sweeten.

review/text: I am not a doctor, but any time one of my friends starts to feel poorly, I tell them to go buy a box of this tea. I suffer from chronic sinus infections and since I've started drinking this I've noticed that the number and severity have decreased. It definitely helps with immune system support. The taste is pleasant, but if I want something sweet (or to coat my throat when it's sore) I add a little eucalyptus honey and it's divine. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!

review/summary: New Love
review/text: I had been reading about echinacea for ages, but I finally decided to try it when I got sick. In addition to drinking tons of water, resting and taking vitamins I've been drinking this tea and I feel tons better. And I read some reviews about the taste - personally I love the taste! It tastes so good I want to start drinking it on a regular basis. It's a nice hot drink to have in the morning instead of coffee and it's tons better for you!<br /><br />I always make my tea with sugar and cream. I don't know how others make it - but adding sugar and cream makes it taste more like a drink than a tonic (which most teas taste like).

review/text: i had a terrible cold and a patient of mine had given me a yogi tea for colds --- took me days before i tried it and when i did i absolutely loved it! so i went on their website and found a whole array of teas they offer. i didn't have an idea where to find it first so i checked out whole foods just because i know that the tea is organic and we all know that whole foods only sells organic stuff. i bought a box of triple echinacea for more than $4! i didn't care at that time for the price but as i googled this tea i found out great websites where i could order this from and lo and behold i just subscribed to amazon's auto-delivery. although now i only drink this particular one twice a day --- one in the morning and one before i go to bed --- not only it supports my immune system but it also warms my tummy in the morning! i highly recommend this tea to anyone who is a tea drinker and even for those who have not tried it...it has a wonderful aroma and its very soothing to the throat as well...

review/text: I just had to write in after reading a few negatives on the taste.  I've tried a couple yogi teas and wasn't impressed with the taste until I met this one.  I LOVE the taste of this tea.  It also really feels excellent on a sore throat.  I am not a fan of licorice and found that flavor in all the other yogi teas I've tried thus far.  This one does not have any licorice flavor.  It leaves a minty, menthol aftertaste, which I love.<br /><br />Taste is so subjective...if what I've written entices you, I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Only reason I give it 4 stars is because I haven't yet been able to attest to the immune boosting properties yet.
