review/summary: damaged K cups rec'd
review/text: I order 100 Kcup each month and this is the first time I rec'd them and found that more than half of the K Cups are not able to be used.  When the water tries to go through, it fills the K Cup with water and then only the ground come down and fill my cup.  I took the cup apart and see that the filter is not attached inside of these cups.<br /><br />I tossed the packing slip as I had never had a problem before and didn't expect that I would have a problem with them.  I am very disapointed in this shipment and wonder if I should try again and accept my next month's order???

review/summary: A smooth, non-bitter coffee for every day
review/text: It's been hard for me to find K-cup coffees that have a smooth, mellow, yet flavorful taste with which to start my day.  Most dark roast coffees taste burnt and bitter to me and must be greatly diluted before drinking.  Timothy's Breakfast Blend breaks that rule and provides the best cuppa I've had other than Green Mountain, and at a much lower cost.  Amazon's big box packing adds value and their delivery is super fast!  I'll buy this one again and again.

review/summary: FINALLY a milder cup of coffee for my Keurig!
review/text: I just received a Keurig coffee maker for my birthday & a package of 12 different varieties of K-cup coffees. Every one was much to strong & bold for my palate! What they consider medium is still very strong.<br />I ordered the Timothy's breakfast blend from Amazon & was delighted at the flavor! Milder with a slight hint of boldness. I like the flavor & it's not too mild,either. Just right as I am not a fan of strong coffees.<br />Very satisfied with this product. :)

We make an 8oz cup and it has a great aroma, mild taste-not bitter, not acidic.  He drinks it black and says it is the best he has tasted.  Hope others feel the same way

review/text: We have been purchasing Breakfast Blend K-Cups for about 1 year.  The flavor is excellent, but during the last 2 months or so, we have been getting a large quantity of grounds in the brewed coffee.  After the last 4 or 5 "grounds" instances, I carefully opened the K-cup and found that the internal paper filter was pulled loose from the rim of the cup, allowing a full load of grounds to pass into the coffee cup.  Until this problem is fixed, we will no longer purchase Timothy's K-Cups.

review/text: I was wondering if I'd ever come across a Kcup I didn't like. It appears I have. I brewed this in my B40 @ the 7.25 mug size. Tasted it and almost spit it out; wish I had.<br /><br />I can't explain the what it taste like for the fact their hasn't been a coffee I ever drank in my all my coffee drinking years that came close to this.<br /><br />I drank this right after having a cup of Timothy's Midnight Magic. Was there a reaction to my taste buds for drinking the Midnight Magic first? Possibly, did I get a bad Kcup? Again that is possible.<br /><br />I received this in a trade from one of our members in our Yahoo group that included this in their "Variety Pack" they created for me. I just glad I didn't buy a full box of it.

review/text: We're hooked. My wife and I have had our Keurig for a year now and absolutely love it!  The Breakfast Blend is a fairly mild delicious brew.  I can't keep them stocked at home.  The 50 count box is convenient and you'll get the best price if you buy in bulk. check it out.

review/summary: Bit watery
review/text: The coffee tasted a bit watery and rather had a weak taste to it, which is what you get with mild coffee. I enjoyed Coffee People Donut Shop K Cups more. I would only recommend you buy this if you think the Donut Shop coffee is strong.

review/text: I love my coffee, and really enjoy Timothy's Breakfast Blend, its mellow yet full bodied.  I also like to keep Timothy's Decaffinated K Cups coffee for later in the day or, when I have company who cannot have caffine.  I have tried them all and for me (and I would suppose  most middle of the road coffee drinkers) I have found this one best.<br />I have just signed up for auto delivery of this product once a month so I will have to wait see if that amount will work out for me. Enjoy!

review/summary: Clean crisp and light, best K-cup breakfast blend so far!
review/text: Timothy's K-cup Breakfast Blend is the best morning blend I've found so far.  I don't care for dark roast at all and I have found many of the K-cup varieties to be too acidic and acrid for my taste.  That is not the case here, this is a clean, crisp, light and smooth coffee.  It's perfect for drinking everyday...  I alternate between this blend and Timothy's Italian (later in the day or with desserts).

review/summary: Good Product
review/text: I own a Keurig coffee maker, and it requires the K-cups for use.  I tried a couple different coffee brands, found them all to be good, but Timothy's is by far the best value.  Its cheaper to make your own coffee, but convenient to use the K cups.  I'm for convenience since I live alone, and don't need a whole pot of coffee in the morning, and making just 1 or 2 cups never seems to taste as good.  Will continue to make this purchase.

review/summary: Timothy Breakfast Blend!  Love it!
review/text: I recently purchased a Keurig coffee pot for my husband.  When purchasing the pot we received several samples of coffee.  Breakfast Blend was one of them!  I do not like the smell or taste of strong coffee and this suits me just fine.  Buying in the 50 count size was the most economical!  I have tried local stores and internet websites.  Amazon has the best bang for the buck.  Will be re-ordering!

review/summary: Mild
review/text: It's a good coffee and the only reason for 4 stars is that it is not Green mountain Breakfast Blend which is stronger. I have to admit that I bought the name of the blend based on price hoping that it was more of a medium roast like Green Mountain's Breakfast.<br /> The coffee is weaker and probably tastes more like a maxwell house or something between a weak gas station coffee and a McDonald's regular coffee - which does not make it bad, it's just not for me.<br /> 5 Stars if you like a slightly weaker Breakfast Blend.<br /><br /> If you like GM's BB, then don't change. I'll bring this to the office.

review/summary: Mild but not Bland or Tasteless
review/text: Currently, this is the only K-Cup 50 pack listed as "mild" on Amazon. I was expecting something with only a little flavor and bitterness, but these K-Cups surprised me. They're not as strong as the bold or extra bold flavors, but the difference is reasonably subtle. They're certainly not bland or tasteless. Also, they do taste to me a little sweet and smoky - just as they are described above.<br /><br />A note about packaging: when I bought a Coffee People 50 pack from Amazon, the K-Cups came in only one box - a thick, corrugated cardboard Coffee People box. Amazon just stuck the mailing labels on the box and gave it to USPS. When this coffee arrived, the K-Cups were in a thin Timothy's cardboard box, which Amazon had put inside one of their standard corrugated cardboard boxes. The upshot is that these Timothy's 50 packs are mailed double-boxed, unlike the Coffee People 50 packs, and so it seems less likely that the Timothy's 50 packs will get damaged in the mail.

review/summary: Great Value Coffee for Keurig
review/text: I have bought several variety packs and specific roasts from various producers through Amazon, and I have settled on this Breakfast Blend for my primary use.  Most of the roast you find for Keurig are bold/dark roasts, and I really do love me some dark roast!  Sometimes, though, you need a lighter, less intense brew.  For those who are searching for this balance - search no more.<br /><br />When brewed with the large cup setting, this is a medium bodied consistently good drink.  When you want a little more flavor, just brew it on the small setting.  It will still be more mellow than most of the palate pounders available right now.<br /><br />I have bought this breakfast blend in bulk several times now.  It is a great value and a great brew.

review/summary: mild coffee, easy on your stomach
review/text: After drinking 1 cup of coffee daily for 30+ yrs, suddenly it seemed to eat my stomach up, even with the large amount of cream I add to it. I discovered breakfast blend by researching the available k-cups at the Keuring website where they give complete descriptions of each blend.<br /><br />Breakfast blend does not bother my stomach. I can't rave about the coffee and say it's the best cup I have ever tasted but it serves it's pupose.<br /><br />I believe Amazon has the lowest price you will ever find. The best deal for any K-cup is the box of 50. If you subscribe to it, you can choose to recieve it automatically at one or serveral months intervals and save 15%. You can cancel the subscription any time. It comes in a nice sturdy reuseable box too!<br /><br />I also buy Green Mountain's Half-caff coffee, also sold at Amazon. If you have a sensitive stomach or are sensitive to caffeine, this may also be a good choice for you.<br /><br />ps....Everyone loves our Keurig. Most people have to buy one after experiencing ours. We even have to take it with us in our RV. If coffee drinkers in your household prefer different blends or flavored blends (which linger in the pot) or you entertain, or just have a very picky coffee drinker who must have his coffee just brewed and then throw the rest out (my husband) this is the pot for you!

review/summary: Was it worth it?
review/text: I purchased 50 Timothy K Cups, Breakfest Blend.  Although we very much enjoyed the taste/quality of the coffee, half of our K-Cups were defective and released so many coffee grounds as to make those cups of coffee undrinkable.  In other words, we only got half our money's worth.  This is very problematic because although we enjoy this particular blend of coffee we can't afford to discard half our purchase because of defective K-Cups.  It would be nice if Amazon.com/Timothy's made good on this purchase.  At least then it would be worth our while to make another order and presume that this was an "isolated" defective batch of K-Cups. Otherwise, it is not worth the risk to make the order again.  That's a losing proposition for the customer.  Customers ought to get what they pay for. Seriously, this just isn't right.

review/text: Timothy's Breakfast Blend does not work in my coffee maker.  Only the Breakfast Blend clogs the system and the coffee overflows and grounds end up in the brewed coffee.  I thought it might have been a bad batch so I purchased another supply and it happened again.  Other Timothy products work fine but for some reason this coffee blend does not.  I've cleaned the system thinking that might have been the problem and I also shake the cup  before putting it in the system to make sure that the grounds are loose.  Oh well, I guess I'll stop buying the Breakfast Blend from now on, I kind of liked the taste.

review/summary: Timothy's Breakfast Blend
review/text: I purchased the Timothy's "Breakfast Blend" k-cups for my wife.  "Breakfast blend" is her favorite coffee choice, one of the coffee selections her employer supplies for their Keurig brewers.  She does not judge the taste of the Timothy's brand as good as the Green Mountain brand provided by her employer.  Having tried both, I concur.  The taste is not bad - just not as good.  However, the price per k-cup for the Timothy's brand is attractive.  For us, this is a case of one gets what one pays for.

The foil comes loose from the cup and causes the grounds to squirt out the opening. This leaves you with a coffee maker to clean up and grounds in your coffee.<br />Thinner foil covering or better sealing is needed before we would buy this product again.

review/summary: Always a hit.
review/text: Have been receiving the Timothy's World Coffee pods for a few months now (using the automatic shipment option) and have nothing bad to say!  They always are shipped in a timely manner and have not received an boxes with damaged goods inside to date.  They fit perfectly into the Keurig Brewer and are best when used with medium-small cups for coffee (for richer flavor).  The only comments that have been said at the office (many people use one machine and these pods) are that some people ask for a different variety of blends - but that not something negative against these pods.  People enjoy the coffee and flavor and they will continue to be ordered!

review/summary: Well balanced delicious cup
review/text: More than 1/2 way through the box already and taste and quality of cartridges has been great.  I prefer a bold tasting coffee and this is a great match.  The Keurig brewer is great for a quick fresh cup and these cartridges work perfectly in the machine.  The aroma is terrific and fresh during brewing.

review/text: This is our favorite coffee of all time...and everyone we serve it to also loves it!  We haven't bought any other coffee in almost a year since first purchasing the Keurig brewer.  It has a fresh mild flavor with no bitterness.  Highly recommend it if you aren't a big fan of strong, bold flavors.

review/summary: Knock off version of Timothy's
review/text: Does anyone realize that this coffee is not from THE REAL Timothy's? I have purchased Timothy's from Keurig and now have purchased it from Amazon and the packaging is different. It looks like they have knocked off the packaging. It is close put there are definitely differences which makes me wonder about how safe this coffee actually is to drink. I ordered the Breakfast Blend and the Pumpkin-which tastes fine but I am just a little leery. I think I will call Amazon to find out what is going on. If anyone has any thoughts, please let me know. Thanks.

review/summary: Bitter to the last drop.
review/text: Since I like dark, full bodied coffees, I thought "Jet Fuel" would be right up there.  While it is a dark roast, I think the roasters went a bit tooo far, as I find this blend bitter and acidic.  I'll finish the box, but I probably won't reorder since there are just too many good coffees out there.

review/summary: This is NOT coffee.
review/text: Do you enjoy the taste of a well-brewed cup of coffee, made from high-quality, freshly ground Arabica beans? If your answer is "Yes", then do not, for any reason, be persuaded to purchase any single cup brewing system nor any brand of pre-packaged coffees, teas, etc. If you enjoy the taste of instant coffee, then you might be satisfied with the mediocre results obtained from these unbelievably popular and overpriced brewing systems.<br /><br />I have tried them all: Keurig, Tassimo, Illy, along with pre-packaged coffees from Timothy's, Green Mountain, Tully's, etc. I have even used my own freshly ground high-grade coffees in these machines. The results are always the same: insipid, dull drinks. How these systems continue to sell is a mystery to me. All the "high-tech" design that goes into making these systems easy to use and convenient cannot overcome their one common fatal flaw - they all rely on vacuum-packed coffee which has lost all of it's aromatic oils and is essentially stale when it is brewed. And the brief time that these machines allow heated water to contact the coffee simply does not constitute "brewing".<br /><br />Einstein once said, "Perfection of means and confusion of ends characterize this age." He could have been talking about these brewing systems. They're great in concept, and well-designed and fabricated... But they can't produce a decent cup of coffee. Isn't that the point? (It reminds one of the futility of creating life-like stereo sound equipment, so that people can play "Rap" on it.)<br /><br />If you really love good coffee, forget the convenience temptation of these systems, and brew your cup the old-fashioned way. You'll save money, and you won't regret having wasted it on something that will wind up in your next garage sale.

review/text: (updated) I have the K-Cup brewer at http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Coffee-Powered-Brewing-Technology/dp/B003XPHG06 and this is the third box of K-Cups I've purchased.<br /><br />I have some from prior boxes but this Timothy cup at the end of the cycle explodes and sends grounds flying all over.  It looks like the cover is slightly thinner than the Donut Shop cups which leads to the failure.<br /><br />-> It looks like the K-Cup technology isn't quite there to me.<br />Bob<br /><br />UPDATE.  Called Green Mountain and they were nice enough to ask for the product details such as codes that tell about where and when this box product was made but could not replace the product.<br />Called Amazon and Amazon issued a full refund which is very nice but does not address my concerns about how to be sure the next batch is going to function correctly.

review/summary: Just Right for Me
review/text: As I've gotten older, I find that really strong coffee just doesn't agree with me any more.  I've searched for a milder blend that would work for me in the morning on an empty stomach.  This is pretty perfect for me.  It's got enough punch to give me my caffeine fix without feeling that my stomach lining is burning.  I also like the breakfast blend by Green Mountain, but Timothy's is more cost effective.  I love that I can order this coffee from Amazon and have it in two days (thanks to Prime).  It always comes in a sturdy box that I can store easily in my cupboard.  I just wish I could have an automatic order for this.
