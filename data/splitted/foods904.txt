review/summary: Tastes like Pure Alcohol
review/text: I feel bad writing a bad review, but I feel cheated and I don't believe other people should buy this product based on my experience with it. Maybe other products of theirs are good, but this one is exceptionally bad, especially since it is supposed to be gourmet. The small bottles of vanilla that you can buy at Walmart taste much, much, much, much, much more like vanilla than this product, which tastes to me, like vodka with a dash of vanilla in it. I feel like I have been cheated, even though for the price it should be a good value. I am actually scared to purchase vanilla now on the Internet in bulk other than from companies I can find and try out in the stores. I can only speak about the bottle I purchased. I would recommend something else. Most vanilla is gluten free although many have corn syrup in them. This one has sugar in it. I really don't understand positive reviews about this product. I bought it because it was cheap (for the amount) and gourmet. It (I think, tastes worse than the imitation). Imitation at least tastes like vanilla. I apologize for writing such a review but other people need to be aware of this product. If you want to buy from this company try something that will have more vanilla in it.

review/summary: REALLY  SMART  PEANUT  BUTTER  CHOICE
review/text: This peanut butter is a really, really great choice!  It has greatly reduced and preferable sugars used in its production and yet has a wonderful peanutty taste!! I would say that the lack of extra sugar actually makes the peanut taste much stronger and more enjoyable. I would highly recommend this peanut butter to EVERY peanut butter lover!! The price on it as sold here is highly comparable to store brands and who doesn't need to try to reduce the sugars in their diets??? MOMS - really think about this item for your household and for your kids!!!

review/summary: Great Peanut Butter
review/text: --Love it. Tastes so good, natural. And I mean no sugar added.<br />Great supplement for any vegan diet needing additional sources of healthy protein.<br />--It's oil does not separate which is a plus. I'm sure many of us have stirred some peanut butter up once before, that's a workout in itself.<br />--Can't see a mention a mention for "refrigerate after opening", so I'd imagine it doesn't need it. If anybody knows please tell me. I'll check with the company too.<br /><br />The above is from my review for the Crunchy variety.  Both have the same great taste and quality so I felt it a service to provide a review for the creamy.  I just so happen to prefer the Crunchy because it's just more fun to eat. ;)

review/summary: Nifty Nifty!
review/text: This is the only peanut butter I will eat!  Often, natural peanut butters have a gritty texture and must be repeatedly stirred to reblend the settled-out oil. Fifty50, however, has a natural taste, free of salt and sugar, and a smooth, uniform consistency.  Occasionally, a little oil will have risen to the top on first opening of the jar, but it can be easily mixed into the body of the product.  (As far as I know, it remains blended, but I never have the unit around long enough to know!)  When my local grocery stopped stocking Fifty50, I was determined not to do without it.  By ordering over $25 dollars, I paid no shipping fee and received a deal at least as good I got purchasing it from a nearby store.

This product has the full flavor of those carb-loaded peanut butters I used to scarf up, but is much better for me as I descend the backslope of the mountain of life. Try it on celery sticks instead of Wonderbread; it helped me lose about 12 pounds before my Alaska mountain goat hunt in September.

review/summary: The way peanut butter is supposed to taste!
review/text: Wow, what a surprise. Fifty 50 peanut butter tastes absolutely wonderful! As a diabetic I have to control my carbs and definitely appreciate products with no added sugar. Fifty 50 has an excellent creamy texture, doesn't separate and requires no stirring. I love it by the spoonful right out of the jar. Whenever I want a sweeter taste I just stir in a little Equal. Please give this a try as a healthy alternative to all those popular brands (Jif, Skippy, etc.) that include sugar. And as an added bonus, you can't beat the price on Amazon!

review/summary: I wish they had some with a sweetener
review/text: I realize lots of folks want a peanut butter that's as minimalist as possible, and this should make them happy -- the only thing it has other than peanuts is some oil to hold it all together. (And, really, who wants some separated, goopy stuff they have to whisk together every time they want a little peanut butter?)<br /><br />But, honestly, what I'd love would be a peanut butter that tasted just like all the familiar store brands, but which replaced the sugar with something like stevia extract. I actually make do using fifty50 and adding in my own stevia -- but then we're back to the whisking every time you want a little peanut butter situation :-)<br /><br />I'm terribly disappointed that, lately, Amazon doesn't seem to be able to stock fifty50, and a bit puzzled at that, as well. Fifty50 has their own site, and you can buy it from them directly with no problem -- which makes me think it's a money thing. Please, Amabamamazamabazon, wouldn't you consider putting it back in rotation? I wouldn't mind a price hike. But if I have to buy it from them, it costs a *lot* more than it cost when I bought it from you.<br /><br />On the whole, I found fifty50 to be great stuff. But unless Amazon lists it again, or it becomes cheaper to buy direct, I'm going to have to figure out something else to do. I'm becoming priced right out of the diabetic-friendly peanut butter market, I'm afraid.

review/summary: Perfect for a healthy lifestyle
review/text: First of all, what I loved about this was that it had no sugar & no sugar substitutes. I didn't notice when I first placed the order than there is also no added salt in the ingredient list. This is perfect for people watching their sugar and sodium intake. I am into fitness and exercise and I love peanut butter because of its protein and healthy fat content. I spread it on whole wheat bread for an even healthier snack throughout the day.<br /><br />About the taste, it's a bit bland at first (I spooned it!) But you will most definitely appreciate the all natural taste of peanuts, unlike other brands that taste too salty or too sweet. When I put it on some bread with jam, it was even better. I have finally found the perfect peanut butter that suits my taste and healthy lifestyle.

review/summary: It's good, but not exceptional
review/text: Honestly, it's not bad at all, but most commercial peanut butter does have some sweetner in it and if you are going from some of those types to this peanut butter, your first impression may be that it doesn't have the taste that you are expecting because the sugar isn't in there.  If you want the sweeter taste, btw, you can put a stevia in the peanut butter and mix it in.  That sounds messy but you can simply do it a bit at a time to the top layer of the jar.<br /><br />I also do not like the fact that it does have hydrogenated oil in it, which means trans fats.  But again this is something else most commercial peanut butters have.  They can get away with saying "0" trans fats on the label I'm assuming, because it's under 1/2 gram per serving.  Trans fats can occur naturally, however, and if you don't eat the peanut butter hand over fist, you really aren't consuming very much of it.<br /><br />I REALLY like the idea of their company to give 50% of profits to diabetes.  I like to support a company that is socially responsible.  All in all I'd buy it again.

review/text: Amazon delivers this product very quickly -- two or three days (to Philadelphia).  The peanut butter is for my mother, who has diabetes.  She's tried one or two other sugar-free peanut butters, but oil seems to rise out of them.  A small puddle of oil is at the top (of those other brands) when the jar is first opened.  FIFTY-50 SUGAR-FREE PEANUT BUTTER DOES NOT HAVE THAT PROBLEM.  (I have no financial interest, direct or indirect, in the Fifty-50 company.  I'm simply very pleased with the product.)

review/text: All the good stuff is left here in this peanut butter. The main drawbacks stopping me from eating more peanut butter which is rich in monosaturated fat and high in protein are a thing of the past with this product. The high salt content and carbs that would cause water retention and thirst are not present here, and this allows me to enjoy the positive aspects of peanut butter with great taste. It also mixes very well with products like nutella, coconut oil, and even cottage cheese if you need a nonfattening and healty late night snack.

review/summary: Excellent Taste -- Wildly Fluctuating Price
review/text: I bought this product in December using  'Subscribe and Save.'  It truly is the best peanut butter I have eaten.  It has a very nice consistency and was formulated for adult tastes, full and rich without being too sweet.  I would gladly buy it again.  But there is a catch.  When I purchased the 6 pack in December the price was competitive with the usual grocery store brands. However, on February 15 I noticed that the price had approximately DOUBLED, making it outrageously overpriced.  I will check again nearer to my subscription's cycle time.  A word to the wise: monitor your 'Subscribe and Save' items carefully, so you are not blindsided by a spike in the cost.

I'd argue Skippy (which has the most saturated fat - 18%) is clearly the best tasting and Fifty50 (which has the least saturated fat - 10%) is bland and the worst tasting, with Simply JIF in the middle (15% saturated fat)...so take those numbers and figure it out on your own my friends...

Now I have notice since December our dogs have really started shedding. There fur also is not as soft as it used to be. I just thought maybe they were shedding their winter coat. Well I finally remembered to check the ingredients on the bag this week. Boy was I shocked when I read the first ingredient now. It is no longer chicken on my bag. It is ground whole grain corn. Now if I wanted to feed them that I would buy the much cheaper dog food. So check your bags for the ingredients. I will no longer be using Science Diet.

They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise.

review/summary: Bait and Switch? I think so!
review/text: I shop carefully, comparing products, sizes of packages, and who fulfills the orders. Somehow this time I was taken for an expensive trip down the pet treats aisle.<br /><br />I like Nutro. This review was written on the page of and about the vendor "eeLe LLC" selling the product.<br /><br />I was certain that when I clicked "Proceed to Checkout" that I was ordering two 60 oz boxes of Nutro Natural Choice Sensitive Stomach Adult Dog Biscuits. They were a good price (within reason - I thought this was $13.95 for a 60 ounce box). I normally pay ~ $14.95 for a 60 ounce size box.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when a small Amazon box arrived and two 23 ounces boxes of the dog biscuits were inside. This makes these very expensive - I can buy 32 ounces at my local Petsmart for $10.99. Of course to return these would cost as much as I overpaid in the first place, so I'm stuck with overpriced biscuits from "eeZe LLC" aka "lindasproperties."<br /><br />The only thing I can figure is that the weight was wrong in the listing, or it was concealed in such a way that I didn't realize this was a little box for the big price instead of a big box for the reasonable price. And since I've looked at the seller stats, this makes bad review number three in a row. It looks like I'm not the only unhappy customer who expected better service through Amazon and feels put upon by the inability to simply send it back and make it right. Fool me once, Shame on you, eeZe LLC and lindasproperties. I won't make that mistake again!<br /><br />However, I will happily share this review on my twitter feed and on my facebook page, and perhaps place it a couple of other sites, just to get the point across to Linda that gouging by bait and switch isn't a nice thing to do.

review/summary: Good for sensitive dog stomachs
review/text: Have two Shi Tzus that will puke up anything that isn't in a very specific range and one of the dogs gets a very acid stomach, so we have to constantly give her small treats to keep the acid down. These treats work great and don't upset their stomachs. The dogs never have a problem with them and they like them. They are semi-easy to break into bits, but it would be nice if they were manufactured with notches. For treats, we've also found that Bil Jacs work good for their stomachs.

review/summary: Too much Salt
review/text: Was so looking forward to this product,  I really enjoyed the regular snack mix and thought the extra cheese would be even better.  I was wrong.  Everything was coated with this cheesy SALTY powder.  Took one bite and was shocked.  I put them in a salad spinner to get some of that salty dust off.  I would not encourage anyone to buy these unless you love a lot of salt. I guess I should have checked the sodium content before I bought them-totally my fault.

review/summary: Tuscan Oil at Its Finest, but....
review/text: Badia a Coltibuono olive oil is a legend, deservedly so. But be forewarned -- if you are used to the bland olive oils sold mass market in most supermarkets, the strong assertive character may come as somewhat of a shock. As noted in the Amazon product description, "according to Deborah Krasner in "The Flavors of Olive Oil", this oil "...is strongly and pleasantly bitter, with a pronounced burn....'It made my face scrunch up.' Very green and grassy, this is an oil made for drizzling."" I would tend to agree with that. In my opinion, this is really at it's best drizzled over grilled meats, vegetables and salads almost as a condiment. For dipping bread and most cooking (it's too expensive for most chefs on a budget like mine anyway) you might prefer an oil from Sicily, Spain, Australia or California, which are softer and more buttery. That said, for purists, this may be the right olive oil even for bread dipping. It's flavors and aromas are remarkably complex and powerful.

review/summary: 5 for Frank, 1 for Amazon
review/text: There is nothing better for a pick-me-up than a Virgin Mary with V8 and Kraut juice.  little horseradish is also good for a bigger kick. My favorite is a 3-1 V8 to Frank's. I gave some friends a 5-1 without telling them, and they really enjoyed it. Salt the rim with celery salt.<br /><br />If you like a "Cincinnati" (beer and tomato juice), throw in a splash of Kraut juice.<br /><br />I have found it in one local chains store (Lowe's Food in Raleigh, NC) but that was it. Cost about $2.45. Then I learned I could get it from Walmart online for about $22/12 cans with a small shipping cost. So the total is about $2.20/can.<br /><br />And Amazon is selling for $3.33/can? Even with free shipping, this is high.<br /><br />Enjoy no matter what you pay.

review/text: I am very choosy with picking green teas. I have tried a few before I came across Lipton's Green Tea. I always felt that Lipton makes tea more along the lines of "mass production" and misses on the exclusivity. But this tea beats my expectations. It has a nice flavor - very subtle - no coloration to turn the tea into a PINK liquid, a nice flavor and very light aroma. Really like it - This is going to turn into my favorite.<br /><br />the only downside, if you like variety and happen to buy this pack alone- then you are stuck with 120 berry flavored green teas :) But of course this is not even a negative :)<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: The best tasting green tea in my opinion
review/text: I've been drinking green tea for over 5 years now, pretty much daily. In my opinion this is the best tasting of all the flavors I've tried, Lipton and other brands included.  It does not have that overwhelming, dark, berry flavor that most of the berry flavored teas have.  It does not turn purple the second you drop the bag in the water.  Very subtle, with just a hint of berry flavor and it takes the edge off that little 'bite' that green tea has.

review/text: I wasn't able to find this product at any grocery stores near me, so I took a chance and ordered a few boxes from amazon.  I drink this tea everyday, and I like it, but it's just not strong enough for my taste.  One bag for one cup seems a little more weak than other green teas I've tried, and I don't like having to use two bags per cup as it doubles the cost per cup.  It doesn't have a very strong mixed berry taste.  I prefer the Lipton Superfruit Acai Blueberry and Yogi Blueberry green teas over this one.  I'm still looking for a good mixed berry flavored green tea with a little bit stronger taste than this.  If you prefer a more mild tea with only a slight berry flavor, this would be for you.

review/summary: Aromatic
review/text: I purchased these fresh curry leaves to make a South Indian Stew and it was a wonderful (and needed) addition. Once added to the tarka (tempering)along with a few other spices, these leaves immediately give off a strong yet aromatic citrus like aroma. Although most commonly used in curries, leaves from the curry tree can be used in many other dishes to add flavor. In Cambodia, Khmer toast the leaves in open flame or roasted it to a crunch and crushed it into a soured soup dish called Maju Krueng. These leaves are NOT related to curry powder and you should purchase these fresh not dried for the best flavor for your dishes. Although it is nit advised to store these in the refrigerator, I have found that if wrapped properly in several paper towels then placed in a ziploc bag, they do last for a few days and up to a week. Discard the leaves that are black.

review/summary: BEST MATZOS WE'VE HAD IN YEARS AND THEY'RE HEALTHY TOO!
review/text: EXCELLENT:<br /><br />These "Streit's 100% Whole Wheat Matzos" are excellent and very good for you. Being Kosher, they may not have all the additives that crackers normally contain to prevent staleness on the shelf. Avoiding food additives is one of the reasons we eat kosher products, the other is we like whole wheat matzos, especially when they are not stale, which is too often the case.<br /><br />WHY WE LIKE Streit's 100% Whole Wheat Matzos:<br /><br />The box we just had was quite fresh and the matzos did not break when we buttered them. They were crisp and tasty and had no added salt. We are getting another box tomorrow.<br /><br />WHERE WE FOUND Streit's 100% Whole Wheat Matzos:<br /><br />These types of ethnic foods are traditionally found on both coasts nearly everywhere, but here in southern Indiana things are different. Oddly enough we found them at a Wal-Mart in Clarksville Indiana, that had a larger ethnic food department. I spoke to the department manager who told me that when they expanded their ethnic food offerings they automatically got these matzos because of their sales rank nationwide. Because they only get a case at a time they rotate their stock frequently, thus avoiding staleness which is the bane of many fresh kosher products.<br /><br />BUYING TIP:<br /><br />Find a Wal-Mart with a large ethnic food department and you will find fresh "Streit's 100% Whole Wheat Matzos" everyday. If not, buy them here at Amazon.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/text: First off, I had no idea what kind of food this was for my cats. I purchased it as a blind guess based on affordability. It came in the mail quickly and surprised me when I received it. The bag is heavy duty and the amount of food is substantial especially if you have one or two cats. My cats loved this food and ate it with no ill effects. The bits are triangular with a hole in the center, which made them easy to eat for my cat-children. I would definitely buy this again. Also, I had no idea what kind of brand this was as I'd never heard of it before. I'm an average chain-store type of shopper and I noticed that at a fancy retailer they carried this brand. I think it's top notch stuff!

That's what you are feeding me?"  This is a good price on a food that they like, I like the convenience of having it shipped to my door as opposed to lugging it from the store.  Now that I know I have their approval, I will be buying larger size bags in the future.  It seems to be more satisfying or filling than most brands I have used because they clearly go through it slower than other brands I am used to.  They dance around the empty food bowl to let me know they want more and then dig right in once it's out for them.  (No disapproving looks!!!)

review/text: I have started making my husband smoothies with a bottle of this ginseng, maca powder, and yohimbe since he was complaining his energy levels and sex drive were low. Well...not anymore! The very first day he drank one of the smoothies I made, I kept hearing from his friends at work that he was flying around that day, asking other people to do THEIR work because he had so much energy! He also did not crash, and had plenty of energy left over for me at the end of the day. ;D

review/text: If I would have known this product contained sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate I wouldn't have purchased it in the first place. I didn't even open it. As soon as I read the ingredients I logged on here to return. I ended up going to a health store China Town before this package arrived and found a variety of different ginseng's that came in a pack of 30 and all of them were less than $10! Some had preservatives and some didn't. Not only did I save money but I purchased a safer product compared to this one. I'm not saying this product doesn't work, but the preservatives it contains will do more harm than good over a period of time. Do the research for yourself.

review/text: I had this tea in England this summer and wanted to order some because I found it to have an excellent flavour. Strong and malty. The tea that I ordered here was very slow in arriving; a month in the mail. When it arrived I found it to be slightly stale and not as strong as what I had in England. I don't know if the North American version is different but this isn't how I remembered it. Still not a bad flavour but not great either.  I won't order it a second time.

I found the taste I remembered from eating peaches that were at their prime right off the tree.  I use this syrup with Sprite to make a wonderful flavored "Peach Sprite" one of my favorite natural flavored sodas.<br /><br />I found this flavor to be great for making peach iced tea.  Again, this is a natural flavor mixer for lemon-aid.  Your imagination is the limit for its flavor uses.<br /><br />Five stars for a real ripe peach taste.

I don't want to keep going to coffee shop and spend 3ish bucks everyday to pay for something that I could make by myself. It is really simple to make TASTY peach iced tea at home. I just use some grey or green tea bag, this syrup and some honey<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO616S">Ambrosia Pure Honey From Colorado's Western Slope, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)</a>. Personally I don't want to use sugar because that's not as healthy and tasty as honey. So I use this honey which makes my peach iced tea taste so good.

review/text: A nice, medium-strength black tea.  Not as strong as 'breakfast' teas, good any time of day. I drink it black, either by itself or with food. To my taste, this stands alone better than Twinings' 'English Afternoon' blend tea, which is of similar body.<br /><br />This was a better unit price than the Twinings I can find locally. I didn't give this the highest rating simply because there are other brands that I think are higher quality, but this is still a very nice, high-end tea. (And easier to find.)

review/summary: It's back to being terrific after a, what, blip? Beautiful color, great taste iced or cold. Best iced orange pekoe!
review/text: Twinings Orange Pekoe has for years and years been my go-to tea for iced "regular" tea (and by regular I mean not fruity or herbally or flavored). It has a gorgeous, gorgeous color and a flavor that seems to brighten with ice. And it's great hot with some milk or cream. When I'm sick, I go through boxes of this stuff and it's a comfort beverage for me.<br /><br />However, I stopped buying it for a while. After the box design changed, I twice got batches that were, no other way to put it, tasteless. I mean, nothing. Watery tea. Crappy iced tea. Flat, not rounded and rich. I was heartbroken and went in search of other teas. Even went back to reliable old Lipton.<br /><br />But recently, I went to an Italian market, saw it on the shelf, and on impulse tried it again. It was back to being great. So, I got this 6 box supply here for a decent price. I'm back to my happy, happy iced tea experience.<br /><br />I don't know what the heck went wrong with the tea that put me on a Twinings hiatus, but that was weird. I see someone else on here (Rebecca Bryant reviewer) had a similar experience. Huh.<br /><br />Well, it's good now. :D Yay.

review/summary: New taste for old tea or bad lot?
review/text: I've been drinking this tea every morning for several years so, needless to say, I love it. Strong, mellow, rich, well-rounded. Typically, I would give it a 4 star.<br /><br />Just recently, however, I purchased several boxes at a local grocery store and was shocked to find the taste completely different and largely tasteless. 1 star at best. I don't know if something happened to one particular lot or if the company has changed the formula.

review/text: This tea is one of my favorites. It is light without tasting like murky water, and the flavor holds up well to milk.

review/summary: A Pleasant Taste, a bit mild for me.
review/text: I can appreciate the gentle, subtle mildness of this Pekoe, but I suppose I prefer the ballsy kick of a nice Breakfast Tea. Even a harsh Irish type. The price jump up to this mid level premium brand just isn't justified by its marginally superior flavor. A teaspoon of sugar almost always balances the playing field with any decent commercial tea. Even Walmart generic tea suits my morning ritual just fine, at a tenth the cost! So there ya go. Cheerio...
