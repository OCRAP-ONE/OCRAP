review/text: This is our favorite K-cup coffee.  It is the most flavorful decaf and is water processed, which is hard to find at a reasonable price.  It is still a little higher in price than most decafs but it taste great.

review/summary: Caribou Decaf - Good Choice
review/text: Finally a good decaf.  I have tried several decaf coffees that were "OK" at best.  I had just purchased the Caribou (Regular) blend and was ready for disapointment when trying the decaf version.  I was extremley pleased to find it was very similar.  What a great concept, a good decaf coffee that isn't bitter or watered down.

review/summary: Excellent Decaf
review/text: We drink coffee regularly and searched for a Keurig decaf that we could comfortably drink ourselves and be happy to serve to others.  We like a good, hearty, cup of coffee, and we drink the Caribou Blend in caffeinated coffee; Caribou Blend satisfies both my wife and me.  I like a strong coffee, and she likes the coffee more mild; this is an excellent compromise; the decaf tasted the same as the regular, so we are happy.

review/text: I have been using a keurig brewer for just over a year now and tried just about ever brand of k-cup/coffee that is out there and never had a problem with cups opening up....until I bought a box of Caribou Coffee decaf from Amazon.  I am about half way through my box of 24 and THREE cups have split at the top seal when brewed. I have never had this happen with any of my k cups and now 3 from one box.<br />Hopefully it was just a bad box but still felt like voicing<br /> my opinion

review/text: I am an enthusiastic coffee drinker who could pass a blindfold test to identify regular vs. decaf . I have always HATED the taste of decaf, but not any more!  Caribou decaf blend is simply the best decaf I have ever tasted. For me to be satisfied, it needs to taste like regular coffee. Caribou decaf does. And for that reason, it has earned a permanent place on my pantry shelf, next to Black Tiger, Jet Fuel and Rev, my favorite regular K-Cup varieties .

review/summary: My favorite decaf K-Cup - Akin to Kenyan Coffee
review/text: Of all the K-Cups I've sampled (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033HGLTG">Donut House Collection Donut House Decaf, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I0N2">Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf Coffee, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047726E0">Green Mountain Coffee Decaf Breakfast Blend,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> just to name a few), Caribou Coffee's Decaf is by far my favorite.<br /><br />Bright, bold but not bitter flavor and light texture are hallmark characteristics of Caribou Coffee and this decaf K-Cup doesn't disappoint.  I'll be so bold as to say that it's as good as "being there" in a Caribou Coffee shop.  If you're a fan of a more Starbucks-y dark roast, this may not appeal to you.  While the Caribou Coffee's K-Cup flavor is not nearly as wimpy as Green Mountain or Donut House, it lacks that nearly burnt flavor that often pervades Starbucks' darker roasts.  If I had to guess, I would say that the primary bean in this blend is Kenya.  If you like Kenyan coffee, this is going to be a winner for you.

review/summary: Best tasting decaf!
review/text: After purchasing a decaf k-cup variety pack, I was really disappointed in all of them.  The after tastes were horrible and I never enjoyed a single cup... neither did my husband.  We've never drank decaf before, but were making the switch as we no longer want caffeine in our diets.  Our friend mentioned that it was probably the chemical process used for decaf coffee's that was making everything taste bad and suggested Caribou decaf as it's processed chemical free.  I was literally jumping up and down after my first cup of this, it was delicious!

The texture and flavor is better than other instant oatmeals; it is not mushy and has the perfect amount of sweetness--not too sweet but not bland and boring. The price is great, especially considering it is approximately the same as Quaker but with the added benefits of being yummier and organic!<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer to ask if it is gluten free. They emailed me: "Our light oatmeals that come in the boxes are gluten free. The ones in big cups are not gluten free." However, I do not think they use certified gluten free oats. I have a gluten sensitivity and do not have any symptoms after eating this. However, if you have celiac, this product is probably not for you.

review/text: This oatmeal is the best! I've been eating Quaker maple & brown sugar since I was a kid and and this blows Quaker away! If you order McDougall's through subscribe and save the price is exactly the same as Acme store brand maple and  brown sugar. The consistency is different than Quaker. Probably the biggest difference I noticed is with Quaker I've always noticed a grainy type texture with every spoonful. Guess I just got used to that over the years. With McDougall's, all you can taste is the real oatmeal flavor with a nice touch of maple and brown sugar.  Subscribe and save has made going organic much easier on my pocketbook too. There is no dollar amount on the fact that it gets delivered to my front door, saving me precious time and gas from going all the way to the nearest Whole Foods for a healthier chioce in eating. It's delicious, cheap and so good for you. Thanks Amazon for your subscribe and save program!

review/summary: Excellent Maple-Flavored Oatmeal
review/text: I risked buying a case of this oatmeal, even though I'd never tried it, because a competitor stopped making the flavor I'd been eating for years. It tastes great, with a pleasant maple flavor that remains for awhile, and it's lower in sugar than most (6g). If you like it sweeter (as I do), just add a packet of Equal. Each packet is well sealed, making ant infestations less likely (a problem with my former brand). One caution to those on a low sodium diet: it does have 180 mg sodium. If you like oatmeal and maple flavoring, you can't go wrong with this.

review/text: I was first drawn to this oatmeal because I love that it is vegan, its so hard to find vegan oatmeal that has flavorings in it.  I also love maple flavored oatmeal so this was a no brainer, I had to buy.  Not overly sweet, just the right amount to let you know what the flavor is, perfect.  Some oatmeal you get and its just so sweet you feel as though you are eating a bowl of hot sugar with no nutrition.  I feel healthy when I eat this oatmeal, and it tastes wonderful as well.  Every once in a while I think about adding more maple syrup though just because the maple flavor isnt that strong, but most mornings I like it because it isnt overpowering and it is easy going down.  Some monrings it is hard to eat certain foods because the flavors are so much more pronounced, I have no idea why that is.  So this is a great wonderful healthy oatmeal that will not dissapoint.

review/text: Usually at home I fix 'real' oatmeal in a pan. But, when I travel that is not possible. This is great to take along. Just a packet for each day and I can fix it with hot water from the coffee maker in the hotel room. Tastes good and is just what I want. Grab a fruit from the lobby (if they have any) and I'm ready for the day.

review/summary: NOT GLUTEN FREE
review/text: Amazon has this item in the gluten free section, but it is NOT GLUTEN FREE.  And you can NOT RETURN the item.  Amazon needs to fix this immediately.  No buyer should be given incorrect information and then made to keep the product that is not what it was sold as.  I make several purchases a month from Amazon and this is the most disappointed I have been with a purchase.

review/text: As instant oatmeal goes, this one tastes very good.  However, a warning if you're gluten-free...this is not certified GF.  I was shopping the GF section and this item came up so I bought it.  It is organic, but nowhere on the box does it claim to be GF.

review/text: I usually find instant cereals to be much too sweet, so I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this. It truly is instant - add hot water and it's done. Nice fine oatmeal texture and great flavor. Most of all - not too sweet! If I were serving it to a child, I might add a touch of maple syrup or brown sugar, but it's perfect for me.

review/text: My son loves this oatmeal and I find that it's a great, low sugar, healthy breakfast that's easy to prepare while traveling.  Since he was a baby (he's now 11) I've always made it with unsweetened almond milk and I add 1/4 cup of whole grain oats to the bowl too, just letting it set for a minute before serving to soften the whole grain oats.  It's still slightly sweet and wholesome.  I can't imagine how sickeningly sweet the mainstream instant oatmeals must be.  It's so nice to see a "light" product that does not have artificial sweeteners.  This product has great flavor without all the sugar.

Lots of cardinals, blue Jays, woodpeckers wrens, little gold colored finches, House finches, warblers and now a HAWK.

review/summary: The food is great... but don't buy it here!
review/text: My son loves Sprout Organics baby food... especially the Roasted Pear.  As it can be hard to find in stock at local stores I have tried (5 times) to order Sprout Organics from Amazon.  Unfortunately, the twelve packs come in a manufaturer's point of purchase box that only has the name of the baby food on a label and 3 of the 5 boxes I have ordered have contained expired food! And lets be real - you are not going to feed a baby expired food.<br /><br />It is very frustrating and I cannot really blame Amazon because as far as I can tell you have to open the manufacturer's box to get to the expiration information.  So - the food is great but buyer beware.  Check the expiration date because more than half of my orders have arrived to me already expired.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have never updated a review but I feel compelled to do so now.  I contacted Sprout and let them know about the expired food.  The customer service rep who I spoke with told me that I "wasn't the first person to call them about this problem" but they seemed to listen to the feedback and even promised to replace the food.  Unfortunately they forgot to send the replacement food so I am now 3 weeks from the date it was received in the mail... no money back... no food.<br /><br />Here is hoping next week brings me better luck.

review/summary: A good organic option...
review/text: My 6 month old enjoys the Sprout Roasted Pears. It was the first baby food we tried with him and the consistency is perfect for a baby who is new to solids. The consistency is pretty runny, so you are able to get most of the product out of the package. (This is my complaint with other Sprout products: While the food is good, it is very hard to get all of the product out of the nooks and crannies of the package, so a lot goes to waste, especially with the thicker foods).<br /><br />I'm not sure that the site mentions it, but Sprout is actually made by Tyler Florence, the Food Network personality.  Not sure if that makes a difference, but it does have a nice story on the back of the package.<br /><br />While others mentioned the price being high, I found it to be cheaper than in the store. My local grocer offers it for $1.55 a package, so it's actually a bit cheaper to order it through amazon. That said, I always try to find a single packet in the store to make sure my son likes it before I'm willing to purchase a box of twelve.<br /><br />Of note, the product does come in a nice shipper and I was able to rip off the front and use the shipper in my cabinet. It was nice to be able to use that to keep the food organized in my pantry. An unexpected bonus for me!

review/summary: Awesome Baby Food
review/text: I found this brand in my local grocery store.  I was having trouble making my own baby food for when we went out for dinner, so I purchased Sprout as a back up.  My son loves his food.  He gets excited seeing the packaging.  I started him with Sprout when he was 5.5 months.  When Sprout went on sale at the store, I bought everything they had for stage 1 and a few stage 2 items.  The sale made it cheaper than the non-organic baby food.<br /><br />The food smells wonderful.  And, I can honestly say, it really does taste fresh and yummy!<br /><br />I have bought Sprout for many of my friends who have babies to try.  And now, they are buying it for themselves.

I was told by my Veterinarian one of the main reasons (besides no soft food) the have great oral hygiene. these natural bones are the right size and the dogs never leave them alone until they are gone or I take them away. Dont give these to them before bed time (crunch crunch crunch). I notice they develop a thirst after chewing for awhile. No digestion problems as a result of eating on these. a great bang for the buck as far as dog treats go. Strongly recommend for dogs that have good teeth.

review/summary: CAIRN TERRIER HEAVEN!
review/text: I recently purchased these bones for my 4 Cairn Terriers. All my dogs absolutely LOVE them ! Even the 11 year old enjoys chewing them and getting off a "little crunchy bit " . The one review stated that they are a little  " messy" . That is true as there are some loose pieces of grizzle  when you open the  plastic wrappr ( that itself is a GREAT feature to be INDIVIDUALLY  wrapped). How I have solved this problem is  that I wash each bone  under running water and then towel dry it before I give to the Cairns . That way there are no loose crumbs. The dogs  enjoy chewing these and it keeps them busy for a long time. When all the the crunchy tendons on the bones are gone , they still enjoy chewing at the  marrow. I have not yet seen any diarrhea or  even any large pieces  chewed off the bones.  They dont seem to splinter either. THUMBS UP for this  product !  They are all natural and  even my Male Cairn who has multiple allergies can enJOY  them!!

They got right into them, but you must supervise as the knobby ends break off and they are about the size of a large marble so could cause some trouble.

I threw the entire pack away, along with the pack of smokehouse knuckles I bought at the same time.  GROSS. I would not recommend these.  Ask the meat man has way better quality products.

review/summary: Popular at my house
review/text: I have given the knee cap bones to my 75 pound chocolate lab and 11 pound miniature dachshund for years. When we added a 5 pound miniature chihuahua to the mix I wondered if she could hold on to her bone with the larger and more savvy dogs in the house. No problem! She is quick and limber and gets to chew whichever bone she wants. She likes to get hold of a bone the older dogs have been chewing on because they have softened it up a bit. Then she chews it for all she's worth. The older dogs are indulgent with her, and she always leaves one nearby as a trade. I take the bones out of the mix when they get small enough the lab could choke on them. The little ones get put in the crate with the chihuahua when we go in the car. All my dogs have great teeth and I credit these bones. They never splinter, but the dogs can chew off smooth bits, which they eat. This brand of knee cap bones are huge and provide many hours of chewing enjoyment for my animals. I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Not for strong chewers, part II
review/text: My 5 lb. Pomeranian was able to chew off the large knobby end of the bone, and then managed to chew off a a smaller 1" knuckle-shaped piece from somewhere (by this time I had already taken the larger knob end away from him), getting it stuck in his throat.  Luckily, he threw it up while we were rushing to the vet.  Even small/toy dogs who are big chewers should not be given this product.

review/summary: Do not buy!
review/text: I would not recommend these to ANY dog owner.  First, they are package very poorly.  Most bones are wrapped in plastic with no air inside, these come in loose plastic and therefore lose the freshness that you expect them to have.  They don't smell like regular dog bones..they smell OLD and just gross.  I bought the knee bones as well as the regular dog bones from smokehouse.  Both were gross.  Splintered very easily and were way too brittle for a dog to chew on. Sometimes cheap things---are really just CHEAP.

review/summary: Upset my dog's stomach
review/text: Got these for my chocolate lab and it gave her diarrhea.  I also have a black lab mix and she can chew on them just fine.  To be fair though, this chocolate lab has a very sensitive stomach.  I have to take her own food when I board her at the kennel and I don't have to do that for my other dogs so if your dog doesn't have that sensitive a system, I think these will work just fine.  My black lab loves them.  (I just have to keep them away from my chocolate lab.)

review/summary: A BIG Hit
review/text: Our 3 dogs love Dingo bones.  But these peanut butter flavor bones are an obsession of our smallest rat terrier.  He's only 5 pounds, so bones tend to last several sittings for him.  Give him one of these and he's occupied for as long as it takes to finish.  He'll still play with other bones, but he loses his mind when he sees me go for this bag.  I just wish they were priced as well as the other Dingo products and less difficult to find.

review/text: My doberman went nuts over this bone.  He tried to devour it rather quickly.  My only complaint about this bone is that it left a mess on the floor; the red color of the bone rubs onto the floor.  It did wipe up fairly easily.  Just make sure when you give the bone to your dog he's not eating it on a carpeted floor.

review/text: I have two 70 lb. dogs. One chews on anything but the other chews on almost nothing. Both will immediately attack this bone and have a ball chewing on it. The one dog usually ignores regular rawhide but I didn't have to wait and see with this, he took to it right away. The price fluctuates wildly with these kinds of bones, so watch for a sale. I paid about 3 bucks.

review/text: Just wanted to warn any potential buyers that I received an open package buying from Amazon LLC.  I think that's pretty disgusting since this is a product that's intended for consumption by your pet.  Also, there were portions of the red "meat" that looked like it had been chewed on and the white bone portion was stained red all over.  Basically it looked as if a dog had chewed on it for a little and then repackaged up and sold on Amazon.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Too big for my dog
review/text: I have a labrador retriever. He weighs 82 lbs. He loved the bone, but I made the mistake and allowed him to eat the bone in one sitting. It was too much of a shock to his digestive system.  The next morning he developed diarrhea. I' m not sure if the bone is the reason the diarrhea lasted so long, but to be causious I will not buy the bones again.  To be fare about the product, I bought three of the bones and the last one was the one associated with my dog's problem, but of course that last bone is the only one he eat in one sitting.  I believe the product would be best for larger dog's than mine, or for smaller dog if the owner regulator the amount of the bone that is eaten at each sitting .

review/summary: the most "straightforward" of the Earl Grey K-Cup varieties
review/text: This is my favorite of the currently (1/2007) available K-Cup Earl Grey teas.  To calibrate this review to your tastes: (1) I like *tea*, plus this one flavoring, not herbs with a little bit of tea -- I'm even finicky about how much Bergamot gets put in.  (2) I prefer Twinings to Stash (in bags, not available in K-Cups) for that very reason.  Twinings is sightly less expensive than Gloria Jean's or Celestial Seasonings, and has the "cleanest" taste of the three.  If you like a "brighter" or more flowery taste, go for the Celestial Seasonings; or if you like a more "complex" or "spicy" taste, choose the Gloria Jean's.

review/summary: Week flavor and leaves tea "powder" in the cup.
review/text: I really enjoy tea, and especially Earl Grey. I do not drink coffee, soda or anything else other then tea and water. So I find myself drinking lots of tea.<br /><br />When I purchased my Keurig, I also bought a selection of teas from Celestial Seasonings, which included their Earl Grey and English Breakfast. After using them up, I decided to try the Earl Grey from Twinings for K-cups but was disappointed. The flavor was quite weak, not to say everyone likes a strong tea, but those who enjoy the sophisticated taste of Earl Grey, often like it to have a bolder taste then what this produced. Also it left a lot of unpleasant tea powder at the bottom of the tea cup which gave the cup of tea an unappealing appearance of being dirty.<br /><br />I would have just assumed that this was the best a Keurig maker could do to produce a cup of tea if I hadn't already had 2 boxes of Celestial Seasoning teas that produced stronger tea with no muddy appearance. I was quite surprised with this result because I ordered the Twinings tea with the assumption that it would be better then the Celestial Seasoning.<br /><br />Not my favorite K-cup tea for the Keurig.

review/text: While these K-Cups worked fine in the system, our tea drinkers found the result to be much too weak to be enjoyable.  "Tea-colored water," was what one person said.  We don't know if this is really a problem with the particular product, or simply that the duration of the water flow through the cup is too short to allow the tea to steep properly.

review/summary: A Good Cup of Tea
review/text: Twinings Earl Grey is my favorite tea, and I drink it almost daily.  I've tried Bigelow, Harrods, etc. and I like Twinings best, either loose or in bags, so I know exactly what this tea is supposed to taste like.  I was a bit concerned that the K-cups would disappoint, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I tried the 3 smallest brew sizes before I found a trick that works for me.  I double-brew one K-cup on the smallest setting.  By this I mean that I run the water through 1 K-cup twice, both times on the smallest size which makes a large cup that for me is about the right strength and flavor.  When you factor in the convenience and speed of using the Keurig, this makes getting a good cup of tea a breeze.

review/summary: Great Earl Grey, Now Available for Your Keurig Brewer!
review/text: Earl Grey has been one of my favorite teas since the first time I tried it (roughly 2 years ago).  I like the taste of bergamot, though I can understand how some might find it strange or overpowering.  This product was, to me and contrary to the opinion of others, just right in terms of strength.  I always use the lowest water setting on my brewer and am able to clearly taste the tea with no trouble and without feeling as though it should be diluted.  Of course, I should clarify that I drink my tea like my coffee (that is black with no sugar).  As a result, the tea may be too dilute when mixed with milk, but I can't say I've tried it that way.  I also haven't found it to leave "tea dust" behind, like another reviewer claimed, but that could be due to luck on my part or bad luck on that person's.  If you're looking for a delicious earl grey tea for your Keurig brewer, look no further.

review/summary: Tastes good, but...
review/text: This tea tastes good, but it is very finely ground and some of that ends up in the cup.  I like to use the same tea k-cup 2-3 times to make iced tea and with Twinnigs it doesn't work because there is so little tea in the k-cup (I suppose that's why it is so finely ground - so they can use less) that it ends up too dilute.  With Timothy's Earl Grey, on the other hand, there is much more tea in the k-cup which allows for my reuse of 2-3 times and the grounds don't end up in the cup.  The taste is about the same except you get more for your money with Timothys.

review/text: I was skeptical when my husband brought home the Kuerig coffee machine.  I don't drink coffee--my preferred beverage in the morning is tea; specifically, Earl Grey.  He told me that Twinings Earl Grey K-cups were available, but I was worried the tea would taste just like it does when you try to make tea using a hotel room coffee maker--like really bad coffee.  So it was a great surprise to find that the Twinings K-cups were so delicious.  Using the K-cups is also a time-saver, obviously.  Only down side is the environmental impact of all those plastic cups.  I'm hoping they come up with a solution to that soon.
