review/summary: Perfect for the beach
review/text: When I told my friends I had ordered 4 lbs of Red Vines for our beach house they thought I was crazy but the package arrived a few days before we left for the beach and the licorice never made it. I guess I should have ordered two so we could have one for the house and one for the beach. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five was that it didn't seem totally soft and fresh. The best thing about the bucket is that it keeps the Red Vines soft, but they were still great.

review/text: Ok, we go thru this stuff pretty fast! Everyone at work(10 of us) agrees that red vines is the best! We like to keep a tub on the desk, it can be a subject of conversation. But I like to have it there to offer visitors.<br /><br />However I was just looking at the Nutrition Facts and per serving you are eating 48 calories in fat. But it says right on the front lable they are always fat free???? Granted it doesn't show any under total fat or any of the fat types, but none the less it does say "Calories from Fat 48"?? Makes one wonder. I just thought I would point it out, but that wont keep us for buying it and keeping it at work!

review/summary: Different from Twizzlers
review/text: I purchased this item about 6 months ago and have eaten about 2/3 of the tub.  I grew up on Twizzlers, but the Red Vines taste more like the thin red licorice ropes I also had as a child and have a mild flavor.  After 6 months in the tub, they are still fairly soft.<br /><br />Reading the other reviews, you either seem to love or hate Red Vines depending on what you grew up with.  To me, the Red Vines are OK, but I prefer Twizzlers.

review/summary: Unpleasant Chemical Taste and Sensation
review/text: In reading the other reviews for Red Vines, it seems to be a product one either loves passionately or hates passionately, with very little middle ground. My order from Amazon is my first time trying Red Vines, and I'm not particularly loyal to any other brand, so here's my honest opinion on them.<br /><br />I'll typically have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> because that's what's readily available in the supermarkets around here, or occasionally I'll have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7NJ2">Lucky Country Licorice, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 4)</a> when it's available at the local Costco. I'll basically eat the Twizzlers because they're convenient, and the Lucky Country stuff because it's really good.<br /><br />I was looking for a good deal on licorice to have some on hand, and the Red Vines brand was recommended to me by a friend, so I decided to give them a try after reading the reviews on Amazon. So, with an open mind and hoping for the best, I placed my order with Amazon.<br /><br />The consistency of Red Vines is completely different than what I'm used to. They come out of the package with a grainy, dry finish, which is a contrast to the smooth, glossy finish of most other licorice I've had. Also, while Twizzlers and Lucky Country are somewhat thick and chewy, Red Vines are relatively thin, almost hollow. They have a lightness to them that the licorice I'm used to doesn't. They stay chewy in your mouth, but the grainy finish gives a somewhat different texture in your mouth. It's neither good nor bad... just different than what I'm accustomed to.<br /><br />In terms of taste, this is where I was most sorely disappointed. I don't know if it's the packaging or some other issue, but they have a chemical, almost menthol-like taste that isn't at all pleasant. The immediate aftertaste is brutal because it feels like you're breathing chemical fumes (almost like the air inside the individual vines is infused with this chemical taste/odor) but when this wears off (after about 3-5 minutes), there is a somewhat pleasing fruity licorice aftertaste that lingers. I don't know if it's a positive that there's still an aftertaste more than 5 minutes later, but it's certainly not enough to rescue them from the chemical taste.<br /><br />I'm now left with a 4lbs. tub of licorice, minus 4 vines, that I will likely throw out because I cannot return a food product to Amazon, and I honestly don't feel safe ingesting them. I wasn't expecting a health food or a natural or organic food product when ordering licorice, but I certainly wasn't expecting the sensation of breathing and eating something not only artificial, but chemical in nature.<br /><br />UPDATE - My parents came by for a visit, and they've previously had Red Vines, so I had them taste it to judge if there was something wrong with the batch I received. They found that it tasted like what they'd had previously, and did not have an issue with it.<br />So their input confirms that there was nothing wrong with my package of Red Vines, and it seems my problem with them is purely that I find them offensive to my palate, and not any fault in the product.<br /><br />So I didn't have to throw them away, and my parents are enjoying them thoroughly, but I wouldn't buy them again, and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone without having tried them first. Like I said initially, it seems to be a product you either love or hate, with no middle ground.

review/summary: Dye, tough package, decent taste
review/text: I haven't had licorice that tasted like this in years, and I still can't decide if that's a good thing. The Red 40 is a bit disconcerting, and the package can be frustratingly difficult to open (maybe that's good to curb cravings). Couldn't pass the price up as a gift for a licorice fanatic, but promptly cancelled the S&S subscription because halfway thru the 4lbs, we've had more than enough. They're addicting, but they just don't feel like food in your hands.

review/text: The actual product is a childhood favorite of mine. Of course, you can't really eat too many of these at a time, or too often. At least I cannot as I would sicken of it quite quickly. I purchased this in the hopes that I would get a fresh tub. Unfortunately, while not stale, they are not the freshest red vines I have ever had. A tub from Costco would easily rival Amazon's supply. They are a bit hard and very chewy. It's simply not fresh enough.

I was hoping for a light and refreshing orange/bergamot tea and this is so far from it that no where on it's label should it "mention" orange.

review/summary: best salad dressing ever
review/text: This is the best salad dressing ever with tons of flavor and not that many fat calories.  it's reasonable if you are on a diet or watching your fat/calories.  it's quite tangy tho so there's a little bite to it.

review/summary: Excellent Salad Dressing
review/text: I eat salad a lot at least 4 or 5 times a week. So I have tried many different dressings. I came across this by accident as a friend gave it to me to try out. A new unopened bottle that ended up not lasting long.  As far as Vinaigrette's go this one is one of my favorites.  There is little I can say besides buy this you will love it. Their website has more flavors and cheaper prices so I recommend going there.  I just ordered the Zesty French and I have no doubt it will be as good as all their other dressings.

review/summary: Fantastic Coffee
review/text: I grew tired of Starbucks coffee and other "big" brands out there. They would be okay for a while and then the taste started to be all the same.<br />I decided to give Moka Joe a shot; I was hesitant at first because nobody had left a review and I'm picky with coffee...<br />I've been ordering this coffee for more than a year now and so it was certainly time to leave them a good one.<br />I love this coffee more than any other; the only downside is that now I can't buy coffee when I'm in the city because I know they'll all taste like *#$& compared to this.<br /><br />Use this coffee with a french press and allow yourself to fall in love all over again with your coffee experience!

review/summary: What a rush!
review/text: I contacted the seller about the quantity for the order. When i ordered this product the item was $19 and change plus $1.99 shipping. I was sent 5 of the Mild Flavor with an added incentive gift of 1 Spicy Flavor and a cool ice cube that changes colors. I would describe the taste as a weak strawberry soda flavor for both mild and spicy(red can). The spicy just has a .... spicy kick to it! I like it. The energy boost is excellent! Do not drink after 5pm unless you need to stay awake past midnight! Better than coffee i would say!<br /><br />Drink 1/3 to 1/2 of the can right away. Drink the rest slowly, preferably on ice in a rocks glass! (**Caution** effects of caffeine are stronger with an empty stomach)<br /><br />I have cases of R3D Bu11 sugar free in my pantry, but cocaine energy drinks take the cake! Now I am waiting for this company to sell by the case! :oD

review/summary: AlsoSalt Salt substitute
review/text: In my humble opinion, AlsoSalt is the best salt substitute on the market. I use no other as it has no bitter aftertaste. I often need to cook from scratch to keep my sodium count low. AlsoSalt makes that extra work worthwhile as it is a great help in making the food taste good.  It does have extra potassium which is not appropriate for all. It also comes in little packets to throw into your purse or pocket to bring to a cafe or a friend's home.

review/text: I'm trying to reduce sodium in my diet and saw this at the grocery store on sale, so bought two kinds (the regular and butter-flavored kind; there's a garlic-flavored one but I couldn't find it).  When I first opened one, I tasted it, just put some grains in my hand and licked it.  It tasted horrible.  Then I read on the bottle that it shouldn't be eaten directly, and tried it on food.  The food tasted saltier.  It's not exactly the same as table salt, but it works, especially if you use it with something you're cooking.  Just don't taste it on its own.

review/summary: Worth buying in bulk so you never run out of tea...
review/text: "There are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea." -Henry James, Portrait of a Lady<br /><br />This "English Breakfast" style tea is quite satisfying and has a darker color than most teas I've made. "Awake" will definitely encourage you to feel invigorated and inspired.<br /><br />I'd like to say that their teas are best steeped for an extra 5-10 minutes to draw out all the delicious flavors. I use my coffee maker to make tea. Simply put the loose tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot, then allow the boiling water to drip over the tealeaves.<br /><br />When you drink these teas you can transcend reality for moments at a time and that is all the truth I need about these teas. Some of these teas even evoke a sense of wonder.<br /><br />Of all the black teas I've tried, Awake truly will keep you AWAKE. When I'm in the mood to write, this tea can jumpstart a very productive day.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great black tea
review/text: I finally bought the 6 pack of 24 of this tea as it is one of my favorite Tazo black teas on Amazon. They are really convenient to use and easy to take along in tea bag form. I also get the loose leaf version at (which is bolder) at Starbucks for under 7 dollars a tin. It is a nice mixed flavor of English Breakfast (Twinings brand is best for English Breakfast in my opinion) and ever so slightly Earl Grey and other black teas. The Tazo Awake black tea is not as strong as some but bold in flavor or aroma, the loose leaf version by Tazo is even more so. I don't drink caffeine in the form of sodas or coffee but I do drink lots of tea and I don't ever feel wired or caffeine'd out after a few cups of tea each day. Tazo has impressed with both their loose leaf and tea bag versions. Seep it long enough to get the bold color, flavor and aroma but don't over do it as the tea will have bitterness if you leave it seeping too long.

review/summary: Calming - Not Sure If It's An Awakener
review/text: I found that this tea really had calming effects. It also helped to clear my mind and slow down my thoughts. I'm not sure if it's a good substitute for coffee like other customers mentioned but it does help to relax you (not in a lazy way). I found myself speaking clearly and feeling more patient about an hour after I drank my first mug. High caffeine, such as in a Starbucks all black, makes me very anxious and I just can't have that anymore. Tazo's awake may be a good substitute, though. I feel more focused. Caffeine just puts me on the wrong path sometimes. I may feel more awake, but caffeine has too many negative side effects. Maybe this Tazo tea might do the trick. I'll have to try it out on a work day.

review/text: I've been trying several black teas recently because I'm trying to lower my coffee intake while still getting some caffeine to jump start my day. In terms of flavor, Tazo awake and stash black were both really nice and clearly more flavorful than the generic lipton type black tea, but I feel like Tazo has a bit more caffeine to get my day going in the morning or if I need an afternoon pick me up. Overall a very nice tea and a pretty good deal versus the close to $5 starbucks sells it for in store.

review/text: Tazo teas are a quality brand that I was introduced to at Starbucks coffee shops. I love getting a black tea lemonade during the summer on hot days and they use the Awake black tea to make the drink. I bought these tea bags to use in my Keurig brewer and just pop a bag in, let it brew and then remove the tea bag and place it in my cup to let it steep a few extra minutes for maximum strength and flavor. I add some sugar and drink it hot. It is a nice caffeine punch when I need a hot drink and am in the mood for tea instead of coffee. I love ordering in bulk from Amazon as the price is great!

review/summary: A Delectible Coconut Oil
review/text: There are lots of good coconut oils to purchase, but this one in particular has a body to it that is unlike others.  The price is very good for the amount you receive, but the fact that it is in glass containers is exceptional, as many companies do not do this.  Also the container has a wide mouth opening, which makes for easy access.  The other product you may want to compare it with in my opinion would be Garden of Life's which is also in glass and just pennies difference.  They are both great, but I am partial to Nature's Approved as it is richer in body.  Enjoy this delectible product to moisturize and heal your face and your body...excellent in privates for women, as well as to consume in smoothies or use to gently saute.  Great for hair if you have very frizzy, curly hair, but not for those with fine hair. If you are new to using coconut oil, a fabulous desert is sauteeing sliced ripe bananas in coconut oil and cinnamon...delish!

review/text: Originally I bought these to be used at my wedding for when guests entered the hall they were offered champagne, so I asked that the sticks be put in the glasses. They didnt use them for this as they gave our guests cocktails. But at the end of the night we had a coffee hour, where they put them out as the sugar. A nice touch.

review/summary: Finally - a bag of heart-shaped jelly beans that taste like different cherry flavors!
review/text: I saw a smaller bag of these at the store and went for it.  Boy, was I glad.  There are, like, 6 different flavors of cherry jelly beans in this assortment!!  The next day (when the small bag was gone), I was thrilled to find a larger tub on Amazon.  It could be, like 3 times bigger for the same price and that would be OK with me, but whatever.<br /><br />Texturally, they're a great jelly bean.  Nice crunchy shell, tender inside.  I don't really know why they're heart-shaped, but they are.  Kind of.<br /><br />The flavors are delicious, except for the chocolatey one.  You might like it.

review/summary: Worst I've Ever Had
review/text: My wife got me started on jelly beans a year or so ago.  Love `em.  The jelly belly's are good but Gimbal's were good too.  And since they are usually cheaper, I usually buy them.  No more.<br /><br />These cherry-flavored beans from Gimbal's are, sadly, incredibly bad.  They are about 4 times larger than a normal jelly bean... in the shape of heart, and some very odd non-robust flavors.<br /><br />A huge waste of money; a huge disappointment.

I emailed them to tell them how much I loved the chips and they sent me a hand written thank you note and a free sample of all their flavors. Now that's how American Business should be run.

review/summary: Really yummy tasting-I was pleasantly surprised!!!
review/text: I'm not big on chips period, however I do like salt and vinegar chips when they are not greasy and thick.  My husband brought home a bag of salt and vinegar Pop Chips and I tried them and loved them!  Especially since they are NOT fried and don't have that un-tasty "healthy" baked lack of flavor.  I wanted to try the other flavors so I bought the mixed flavors on Amazon.  I have to say, my favorite is the salt and vinegar-but I'm vinegar mad.  The black pepper and sour cream and onion come in second, then the cheese and plain.  My least fav is the bbq as the flavor is just too strong for me.  I like that its a kind of "junk food" product I can have in the house and not feel guilty about because it only tastes like its bad for you!

review/summary: Awesome Alternative to Chips!
review/text: I was skeptical from all the bad reviews and the warnings that these would never replace real chips (my one real dieting weakness) and I was worried my boyfriend wouldn't even try them. But, I got a box of 2 of each flavor to check them out.<br /><br />I was very surprised at the amount of flavoring on each chip, and although it's not the traditional crunch of a ruffle, it's perfect for tricking yourself while still maintaining a better food habit. The serving size is about 22 crisps, which is a lot if you actually count them out, and it's easy to portion out 3 servings per bag. My boyfriend even likes them now and we are impressed that the barbeque flavor (one of our least favorite varieties of regular chips) is still extremely tasty and satisfying.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about these and don't want to waste $20 in case you don't like them, pick your favorite flavor and buy just one 3 oz bag. I don't regret it since I haven't been depriving myself completely of my favorite cripsy snack, even when I go to parties I'm not overly tempted to stuff a handful of salty, greasy chips into my mouth. Since I've been bringing the bags into work, I've gotten coworkers hooked as well :) Overall, a really good find.

I almost ordered two since they were such a good price, I am so glad I didn't! We don't care of these AT ALL! The concept is nice, chips that are crunchy and better for you than most, BUT they taste funny! They have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable. We have been slowly making our way through the 12 box so they are not so horrible that you can't eat them, its just like forcing us to eat them so we don't have to throw them all away! If you haven't had them before, I suggest trying them before committing to 12 bags of various yucky flavors!

The pepper and the vinegar are both quite strong and have to be washed down with cold beer.<br /><br />But other than that, the chips are crispy and fresh and don't leave a greasy trail on your hands.  No other lingering chemical aftertaste whatsoever.  It's hard to eat just one of these; expect to finish off a bag in one sitting!<br /><br />The package arrived with contents whole.

If you are looking for low calories definitely continue on your way!

review/summary: Best Potato Chips Ever!
review/text: These are the best potato chips i've ever had! It's like i'm eating a real piece of potato instead of a greased up fried version with all kinds of additives in it. It's flavored with natural flavoring so it's complimentive to the potato and not fake and overwhelmingly greasy like other potato chips. I've tried them before from a store and loved them so much I wanted to try other flavors (which my store didn't offer) so I bought a varitey of them online. They were perfect, no shipping issues and they arrived pretty quickly. My most favorite flavor is BBQ. Next time I may buy just a whole case of one flavor :)

review/text: I really, really love Pop Chips. They are much lower in fat and calories than regular potato chips, plus the texture flavor is much more enticing. I would say the BBQ is far and away the best. The Sour Cream, regular potato, and cheddar are in the "good" category. I don't care too much for the Sea Salt / Vinegar and Salt / Pepper flavors, I usually end up giving them to friends or family. Purchasing in this bulk size means saving at least $1/bag over the chain stores though, which is definitely a plus. If you haven't had them yet, give them a try, almost everyone I've introduced them to loves them. If you're already a fan, consider these bulk packs from Amazon, they're convenient and inexpensive.

review/summary: A healthier alternative to the regualr potato chip
review/text: I wanted to try these chips because of all the good reviews and I enjoy trying new things. My first reaction when trying these chips was they're very good as a healthier alternative to a "regular" potato chip BUT in terms of taste they're not as good. A regular potato chip is fried, it's slightly greasy, and has a lot of fat and saturated fat and tastes great. Yes it's not the healthiest thing to eat but that's not the point - I'm talking strictly taste. Just to give a comparison a 1 ounce serving of Popchips has 120 calories, 4g of fat, and 0(zero) saturated fat. A 1 ounce serving of Kettle krinkle cut potato chips has 140 calories, 9g of fat, and 1g of saturated fat. A 1 ounce serving of Lay's Classic potato chips has 153 calories, 10g of fat and 3g of saturated fat. So you can see the Popchips numbers are a lot lower.<br /><br />As for the taste of the Popchips given what they are - they're pretty good and do satisfy my salty snack cravings I get a lot. But when I want to indulge a little more every once in a while I'll go for the greasy and fatty potato chip.

Personally I don't care for normal potato chips and I tend to each healthier than the average person. Pop chips are still empty calories, but they are much better alternative than other chips you might buy at a super market.  An entire bag of pop chips is around 400 calories, as opposed to a serving size of normal chips.  My favorite is Sour Cream & Onion, but they all are pretty good. Take my word for it, try them and you won't be dissapointed.  And you will be eating healthier!<br /><br />Happy eating!

review/summary: Blah, healthy but not tasty
review/text: I bought this because it seems to be quite popular amongst people so I decided to try it and see for myself. The flavors that came in this six flavor variety package were Original, Barbeque, Cheddar, Salt & Pepper, Sea Salt & Vinegar, and Sour Cream & Onion. Although I tried all the flavors, the last three mentioned flavors have dominated my taste buds to create the impression that Pop Chips is mostly of salty or bitter flavors. The Original flavor was okay, gives you an idea of what the original Pop Chips is supposed to taste like. It's cool that it's not baked or fried so it's healthy. When I think Barbeque flavor, I immediately think of Lay's Barbeque Potato Chips. If you can't match or surpass Lay's Barbeque flavor you fail, and Pop Chips fails. You can taste the barbeque flavor but it is very subtle. The same goes for the Cheddar flavor; the cheddar flavor is very subtle. I like the cheddar heavy on please. I'm guessing Pop Chips is trying to make healthy chips so additional flavorings like barbeque and cheddar are moderately laid on. As for the remaining rest (Salt & Pepper and Sea Salt & Vinegar), they're not very tasty and somewhat bitter to boot. If you like bitter than those flavors are for you. I prefer sweet flavors. My mom tried an unfinished bag of Salt & Pepper that I had laid on the table one day and later told me the chips were not very good and to not buy them again. Sour Cream & Onion I like when I'm really hungry or in the mood for sourness and have sweet liquid around to neutralize the sour. When I first received this package, I had touted to my mom about all the good reviews. Needless to say I was disappointed after I tried these chips out. I don't think I would buy these chips again unless I was seeking to eat a little more healthier.

review/summary: I love the Popchips!!!
review/text: For years, my weakness has been chips in particular. As I got older, I've tried to quit the chips but was unable to do so. So I've been looking for a healthier alternative for years with little success. I've tried organic, low sodium, baked, even forayed into the sweet potato chip.  Taste was always a compromise, but when you compare nutrional value, there just seemed minimal benefit to switch from regular chips..., until I found these Popchips! I'm not saying the taste is an exact replication, far from it. However it's leaps and bounds ahead of the other options I mentioned. And nutrionally, forget about it; a fraction of the fat and calories! I can pound a 3oz bag of these without any remorse. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a healthy alternative to chips like I was.
