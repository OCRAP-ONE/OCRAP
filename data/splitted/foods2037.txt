review/summary: NOT A BIG FAN!!!
review/text: I did not like this tea at all.  I enjoy tea from time to time.  My wife drinks it more than me, she has a cup after work everynight like clock work.  We bought a box of this tea a while back and it is still sitting in the cuppboard, missing maybe 4 at the most.  I like English Breakfast tea and drink it by the bags but these cups are horrible.<br /><br />If you have the K-filter you can brew certain loose tea in it.  My wife uses it all the time and it comes out pretty good.  There are decent teas available through k-cups, this is not one of them.

review/text: I LOVE Earl Grey tea. Somehow I ordered English Breakfast by mistake. Unfortunately, I ordered in bulk, so I'm stuck with this bitter tea until my next order.

review/summary: Maybe the greatest soft drink EVER!
review/text: Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The orange flavor reviewed here tastes a lot like a lighter version of Orange Crush, without the cloying sweetness. It's hard to put my finger on it, but there is enough of the original flavor's lemon-lime backbone to make an impression on the taste, in other words you get a distinct Ramune-brand flavor with this drink. It's incredibly good and not heavy on the palate like a lot of Western sodas.<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.

This tea contains Dandelion which is beyond exceptional for liver detox and skin health. I have also noticed a caffeine like feeling after just one cup because of all of the nutrients.

review/summary: Wonderful and at the Right Price SPECTACULAR!!!
review/text: This Extra Virgin Olive Oil is just like the excellent imported stuff I grew up on. It's fragrant and has the good bite that makes you want good foccacia or crusty artisan bread for dipping, don't forget the fresh ground pepper. OMG the aroma of the onions and peppers sauteeing in it before you scramble in the eggs and a little grated Parmesan cheese, like dying and going to heaven. Drizzled on sliced tomatoes and mozzarella cheese, yummy. Healthy, tasty and a great entry into the Mediterranean Diet for a longer life.<br /><br />Of course this is NOT for standard frying. It will burn and smoke then taste like hell when you're through. Plain Olive Oil is better suited for that. I bought this direct from Carli for 30 bucks including shipping & handling AND a bonus European Tea Towel and Apron.  It'll be interesting to see if Amazon keeps this in stock and at an equally competitive price.

review/text: My family did not like the garlic butter rice as the directions state to cook it.  My 5 year old daughter who loves rice and garlic would not eat this rice the first time I made it.  The garlic flavoring is way too strong.  I made it again, but cooked one cup instant rice to mix in with it.  Everyone in the family then ate it.  From now on, I will cook one cup of instant rice to mix into it to use up the rest of the packages I bought through Amazon.  But, I will not buy this again.  Knorr/Lipton has much better rice flavors than this.

It cooks sooo much faster than the Maggi brand & tastes just the same.  I love this this spaetzle!  Everyone loves this brand better than the other & I would definitely buy this again.

review/summary: Disappointed in this one
review/text: I've been trying out teas for the past few months, since I quit coffee. Teavana has my favorites, but it's really pricey, so I thought these might do, and I ordered a couple. First of all, the tin arrived seriously smashed, not sure if that's the fault of Amazon.com or the original seller, but they weren't insulated at all, just rolling around in a big box with some other stuff I ordered. I could ask for a refund, but they'd want me to return it, and it's not worth the hassle.<br /><br />As for the tea itself, I'm not impressed with the flavor. I added flax milk and agave nectar, and those are the only flavors I can taste. Brewing good green, white or black tea is a delicate process, and I have an electric pot especially made for this, but next time I'll try doubling the amount of tea, which would make it even more pricey than Teavana.

This seems to be a common problem too, because in the latest "Bengals Illustrated", they gave Wellness a very low rating in terms of desirability to cats (i.e., how much they like it).  Too bad. Also, one must consider the recent recall of Wellness food (their canned food actually, but same company).  Can we trust them?

review/summary: Great kitten food!
review/text: This dry food is great!  My kitten (5 mos. old) has been eating it since I brought her home when she was just 8 weeks old.  I bought it because it is a good quality food that I feel safe feeding to my little one.  She eats this along with Wellness wet food.  Her coat is beautiful and she's had no health problems.  She is not overweight so I think this is a good food to control weight if your cat is self-fed.  It is of course pricier than other brands but I am willing to pay that to know that my kitten is eating healthy, high-quality food.

review/summary: Good ingredients, reasonable price, kittens tolerate it
review/text: I did a bunch of research on cat foods, and realized that although wet food was recommended (no grain, more moisture), I was not available to provide my kittens the frequent feedings they would need throughout the day, so I decided that leaving out wellness kitten health dry food and supplementing that with wellness canned food for breakfast and dinner was a good compromise.<br /><br />Why Wellness in particular?  It has more quality muscle meat and less grain than most dry cat foods, it is one of several dry foods that are recommended by cat dieticians (do your own research on the web, you'll see), it's not insanely expensive, and it is widely available, both online and in local pet shops.<br /><br />This approach has worked well so far.  The kittens were used to an exclusive diet of Royal Canin dry food (which is awful stuff) when I took them home, so it took a few weeks of mixing the wellness dry food with Roayal Canin dry food to get them to accept it.  Wellness has *much* better ingredients than Royal Canin though, so it was worth the effort.  They actually got to the point where now they were sifting through the mixture of both foods to pull out just the Wellness bits, so I knew it was time to stop mixing.<br /><br />Now I've got them on an all-wellness diet things are going very well.  Their poo's are firm (which is not the case for many bengal kittens), they enjoy the food, and I have the satisfaction of knowing that I am giving them something of really good quality.

review/text: I have both my Kitten and Adult cat on Wellness formulas. I've noticed that the product is always fresh, because it has a nice smell and a crispier crunch than any of the other brands we'ved tried in the past. They also prefer the the taste over past brands. My older cat also tends to have digestive issues, but her movements have been normal and less stinky with Wellness.

review/text: Gives my 6-month-old cat diarrhea. I even slowly introduced her to it, mixing with other foods, then only giving her Wellness kibble by itself. I think it's "too healthy" for her with all the fiber(she was a stray when I took her in). At least now I can feel better about giving her the less-expensive brand of cat food!(Going back to Iam's, which seemed fine for her at the start.)

review/text: I've been using Wellness Kitten Health dry food for about 3 months now and my little kitten loves it. I use a Petmate Le Bistro with scheduled feedings and he always finishes his meal. He seems to be growing nicely, is not overweight or underweight, and was healthy at his last vet checkup. This food is a bit pricier than other brands but the premium ingredients and guaranteed nutritional content make it worth it in my opinion. Also a plus is that it doesn't have a strong odor. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Pros:<br />My kitten loves it<br />Premium ingredients, nutritional balance<br />Minimal odor<br /><br />Cons:<br />Slightly expensive<br /><br />Bottom line: A premium dry food designed for kittens that my kitten loves. What more could I ask for?

review/text: My 6 month old male Tuxedo cat likes Wellness Kitten Health Dry Kitten Food which is a round pellet shaped kibble. It contains no meat by-products, corn, corn gluten, wheat soy, artificial preservatives colors or flavors.  Based on the stated ingredients and nutritional information, I award Wellness Kitten Health Dry Kitten Food "5 Stars," and would think that this kibble should be applicable to cats of all ages, even though the bag seems to designate it only as kitten food.  The plastic bag is one of the nicest kibble, dry cat food bags on the market, featuring a resealable strip, which is a nice feature that some other kibble cat food bags, that are seemingly more paper based, do not have.

review/summary: Very Dissappointed wtih recent Wellness company news
review/text: Today, I discovered that the Wellness company (Wellpet) was recently acquired by Berwind [...], an investment management company with a portfolio primarily consisting of coal mining and chemical corporations. My personal beliefs are very much centered around conservation, the environment, and supporting clean and sustainable energy industries so to find this news out is quite a blow. I actively try my best to avoid supporting the dirty industries of this world, therefore I'll no longer be buying Wellness products as difficult as it may be:<br /><br />For the last 6 years I have fed my cats Wellness dry & wet cat food with excellent results.  Last year, my cat Isaac passed away. He was a special needs cat since a kitten and as an adult cat, many vets told me repeatedly that I should probably put him to sleep due to his condition (various over the years: arthritis, megacolon, leg paralysis, neurological issues, & urinary tract infections). Isaac wasn't supposed to live past 16 years old but thanks to a Wellness diet and lots of love, he lived to the old age of 22.

review/summary: misses the mark
review/text: I switched our 10 week old kitten from Science Diet Kitten to Wellness Kitten because she had the runs from the 1st day we adopted her. The shelter first said she never had diarrhea, then admitted she got the runs when she was spayed 2 days before we picked her up. So we are dealing with the unknown. Two stool tests were negative so we feel this might be food-related. This kitten was also being fed wet food with the kibble (Purina Pro Plan Kitten) I did some online research and decided to stop the dry food as it contained grains which is very bad for the runs. And I also stopped the Wellness dry as it has grains. The diarrhea has lessened, but it's been 2 weeks now & I'm still stumped. I did add some dry baby rice cereal into her canned food, and also include a capsule of probiotics (spread out over 4 daily meals). She had a more formed stool today, so maybe she's turning the corner.<br /><br />I also question Wellness putting vegetables/fruits in this kitten food! These are NOT foods cats would eat in the wild. Is this just another company trying to make a buck off us by putting in things we know are good for human health? That would be the ultimate con job. I truly don't think cats need to eat fruits & veggies, so Wellness is fast going to the bottom of my feeding list of good foods for cats.<br /><br />In fact, almost all cat food companies put out junk food for our beloved forever friends!<br />I will continue to try to find something more appropriate for this kitten, and another kitten, adopted a week later, from a different litter (and w/no digestive issues - she was/still is being fed Petsmart brand Authority wet & dry - the dry contains grains/corn, but I won't switch her as her digestion works great on it)<br /><br />Wellness came highly recommended to me, but my search for a grain-free/veggie/fruit-free/wheat-free kitten dry kibble continues....so Wellness Kitten kibble is off my list. I will try their canned Kitten formula but not easy to find thus far.

review/text: I drink coffee everyday, and subscribe to the theory that life is too short to drink bad coffee.  I've taken gambles on coffee in the past and have thrown it away.  This coffee brews up a good, dark, rich cup which I drink black.  It has a subtle smokey background, but is not bitter.  As with all coffee, it should be brewed (or pressed) with the proper grind and in the right porportion, but when done right, it's good coffee.  I also like the fact that it's organically grown and traded fairly.  If you enjoy dark roasts, you will not be disappointed.

These beans are very oily, very strong, and has some complex flavors including spiciness. If you just love smooth italian espresso, then this could be too strong for you. It doesn't have so much of burnt flavor or bitterness, though espresso could get bitter sometimes if you grind them too fine or tamp too hard. I've never tried these in french press or drip, but my guess is that if it is brewed for correct amount of time, it will produce very nice coffee.

Superior to beans I've paid more than twice the price for.  My only caution is that you will need to step up your cleaning routine for both the grinder and the pot - all that oil gums up the works with residue and will eventually lend a bitter taste to everything, and may well clog your burr grinder.  But the extra work is completely worth it - coffee excellence at this low price is worth extra effort.

review/text: I really like this protein because its low-calorie and has extra fruit and vegi antioxidants in it. Its only 90 calories for 15 grams of protein, made from sprouted rice protein and has some heavy-hitting nutritious foods like quinoa, amaranth, beets, bilberry, cranberry, pomegranate and tons of other good things. Its organic but its affordable and has that great protein-powder taste I love. Really, I can't say enough good things about it.<br /><br />As far as critiques go, the only thing I can say is that this stuff is REALLY THICK. The powder itself sort of sticks to things, and I usually have to go in and scrape the side of the blender a couple times before I'm done making my smoothie, but it ends up making it almost ice-creamy.

I was very surprised after trying a different protein. The Vanilla is Peruvian vanilla so it doesn't hit you over the head with vanilla like some powders do. Like another reviewer said it is very thick- you probably don't want to make it too much before you drink it because the longer you let it sit the more thick it seems to become. I tried mixing w/out a blender and I had many many clumps in my glass.

review/text: I think this is a good powder for people who don't like stuff that is sweet - I couldn't really taste the vanilla or sweetness much at all, so for me this doesn't work as a standalone protein powder. Instead, I mix it with other powders that are too sweet (I'm looking at you, Vega Berry Flavor!). It's not bad, but there are other powders I like better - the main advantage this one has over those is that it is pretty low in calories.

review/summary: The most delicious hot chocolate from home that I've tried...  I love it!
review/text: Like I said in another review, I'm a confirmed hot chocolate snob.  I'm addicted to Dunkin Donuts hot chocolate and own a Keurig just to brew hot chocolate.  That's how hardcore I am.<br /><br />And this hot chocolate is, hands down, the best, most reasonably priced at-home hot chocolate I've ever found.  The variety is amazing, and while some tastes are better than others, there's not a truly awful flavor in the batch.  When I make it, I make it on the Keurig setting for 7.5 ounces, which makes it slightly more watery than is suggested (they suggest 6oz of water), but the result is still fairly creamy, rich, delicious, richly colored, frothy on the top, and well-flavored.  One of these days I might try brewing at the 5.25oz setting and making up the difference with half-and-half, but I don't know that my mind or tastebuds are prepared for how amazing that would taste.  But even when done with just hot water, this is just delicious hot chocolate.<br /><br />My breakdown of the flavors is as follows (my box is apparently a little different, but I got it at a different place):<br /><br />Caramel ~  There is a very pronnounced caramel flavor.  Almost like somebody poured caramel right into the cup.  The smell is amazing and the taste is just delicious.  The caramel does tend to overwhelm the chocolate a bit, so if you're not a fan of caramel you may find this too sweet.<br /><br />Supreme ~  Not a flavor I was initially excited to try, but the taste is very good.  By far and away the most chocolate-tasting hot chocolate in the batch, it's simple and just your typical, very chocolaty hot chocolate.  I really can't tell a difference between this and the hot chocolate at Dunkin Donuts.<br /><br />Hazelnut ~  It tasted like hot chocolate and it wasn't bad, but I didn't get any real flavor difference out of this than, say, your typical hot chocolate.  It tasted like a weaker version of Supreme.  Still very excellent, but no pronnounced unique flavor to speak of.  Nice though for when you want a good hot chocolate that doesn't blast your brain with chocolate overload.<br /><br />Mint ~  I would knock over my own mother for a cup of this.  It tastes EXACTLY like a Thin Mint cookie in liquid form.  While some may find it ever-so-slightly too minty and in need of maybe a little watering down, I think it's amazing.  Quite probably the best hot chocolate flavor available anywhere, and I'm not a minty person at all.<br /><br />White Chocolate ~  My least favorite flavor.  It tasted fine, though slightly off.  I guess it resembed white chocolate very well which is why it tasted so different (because yes, we all know, white chocolate isn't really chocolate...), kind of like sweetened milk.  I don't know...  Not bad, but not great.  Just different and not my favorite flavor.<br /><br />Raspberry ~  I expected the most out of this flavor and it is certainly very good, though unlike the others which seemed to have a very pronnounced flavor of chocolate along with the other taste, this one really didn't.  It did have a sweeter, berry-like taste to it, but more like artificial berry, Kool-Aid berry, which was good, but not quite the berry experience I wanted.<br /><br />Aside from the odd tasting white hot chocolate, this is darn near the perfect collection of delicious tasting hot chocolate available that is both easy to find and not painful to your wallet.  I wish the Irish Cream flavor was in this set, because that one is amazing too.<br /><br />I have nothing but great things to say about the Land O Lakes line of hot chocolate and I hope it's around to stay.  The price cannot be beat and the quality certainly makes you think you bought a far more expensive brand of cocoa.  Lindt taste on a Swiss Miss budget so it's darn near impossible to go wrong.

review/text: The assorted cocoa classics arrived in time for Christmas. Some flavors were amazingly good, but some were sooooo bland. I prepared the cocoa with half water and half milk, a good trick with packaged mixes. I'd buy some, but not all, flavors again! (The packets made great stocking stuffers for kids.)

review/text: I love Land O Lakes Cocoa.  I love shopping via the internet, especially on Amazon.com.  This seemed like a good deal, especially since I am willing to pay a little extra for the convenience of shopping at home. (Don't tell me that a product is cheaper at Costco - it takes me an hour travel time and another half hour just standing in line at that store.)  However, I got no Chocolate Mint and no Dark chocolate in my variety.  I enjoy all the flavors I received, so I see no need to return anything.  But I won't order from this seller again.  If they ship one order different than what was advertised, what might I get next time?

review/summary: Salt of the Earth
review/text: Actually it's the 'earth' in the salt -- traces of red clay -- give Alaea salt its warm-ember color. Claims are made for the nutritional value of trace minerals in sea salts, but I can't confirm any of them. What I like about this salt is its generous color, which stays red (because the salt is ground coarse and quite dry) and sparks the visual presentation of all sorts of dishes. Perhaps it's "subjective," but I think I can taste the difference also, on a simple soft-boiled egg for instance. If it's an illusion, at least it's an allusion I enjoy.<br /><br />Three 9.5 ounce jars is quite a lot of salt, so don't fret about the price. This salt also works wonderfully for sprinkling on the tails of goony birds and for salting the sidewalks of doll houses in the frozen north but is not recommended for absorbing red wine spills on heirloom tablecloths.

Some of my jerky has actually gotten to former football great, Derrick Thomas (RIP) and  country singer, Hank Williams Jr. The price on Amazon of $9.00 a bottle is 3 times what you can get it for in the local grocery store. I was simply looking in here because I have run our local store out of stock because I give a lot of jerky away for Christmas. The marinade is awesome - the price is theft!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Very nice - high quality chocolate
review/text: The Schladerer Fruit Brandies chocolates are much MUCH better than anything labelled "Very Special Chocolates".  These fruit brandy candies taste like they are made with high quality chocolate while many of the other bottle-shaped candies taste waxy and low-quality.<br /><br />The fruit brandy fillings are nice, and while very sweet they do not seem overly sweet for the candy balance of flavors.  Of course the fillings are not very fruity but you definately get a little whiff of liquor when you bite into one (nice!)<br /><br />On my personal review scale of liquor-filled chocolates:<br />The "Very Special" ones are terrible and not worth the time and money (or the calories)<br /><br />The Schladerer are lovely and made with high quality chocolate, a winner<br /><br />The Ausbach brandy chocolates are the best I have ever tried, with even nicer (darker) chocolate and a stronger whiff of liquor in the filling

It would be fine if I was using it in prepared dishes, but, I use it in cookies such as pizzelles and the chafe would have been very noticable in these cookies. I would still buy it again, as now I know I have to sift it through a fine strainer to remove the hulls and stem pieces. Like I said, the flavor was very good and I would use it again.

review/summary: A fine and sturdy everyday tea
review/text: This is a very drinkable blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips, one of the UK's most popular brands. Although some California grocery stores (and Cost Plus World Market) stock this tea, I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag (that is available in the USA). As expected, PG Tips makes a stronger brew. Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag. I drink my tea black, but PG Tips is clearly robust enough to maintain character with milk or sweetener.<br /><br />PG Tips is a sturdy, straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton's. It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands.<br /><br />PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. Does it make better tea? I don't know, but it is a point of differentiation.<br /><br />HINT: PG Tips also makes a Special Blend black tea that is only slightly more expensive in stores. I much prefer the Special Blend to their regular black tea. The PG Tips Special Blend is a very hardy and rich breakfast tea. The Special Blend is more sensitive to longer steeping times (I usually steep mine less than 3 minutes), but I find the taste more complex and satisfying.<br /><br />Cognoscenti typically prefer loose tea. Tea bags contain the less expensive "fannings" or "dust," remains from processing loose leaf tea. And with some others brands of tea (not PG Tips), many people can taste the paper used in the bag.<br /><br />If you (like I) sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags, I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea. And, I more strongly recommend their Special Blend as a hardy and rich breakfast tea.
