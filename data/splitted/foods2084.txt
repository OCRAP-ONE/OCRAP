review/summary: Great for curbing hunger
review/text: These are fantastic for curbing hunger throughout the day.  I eat one for breakfast every day, and I even use them as substitute for lunch sometimes as well.  I've tried the peanut chocolate, chocolate, apple, and these.  This is my favorite flavor of the four varieties I've tried.  My girlfriend eats them pretty frequently as well.  We have both lost a few pounds since we started incorporating them into our diet.  I am very pleased with these bars.

Since these bars are designed to last 9 hours, I tried it. I eat one before going to bed. I was skeptical, but it worked! I sleep through the night now. Great solution for me.

review/summary: I like them enough to mail order them.
review/text: With 11 grams of protein and five grams of fiber, I find these bars to be a good deal.  The taste is robust, they have enough chewiness to them to make them last and, maybe most importantly, they make me feel satisfied with just one bar. Nutritionally, I think they compare or exceed every other bar on the market.

review/text: This product is a total rip off - it is just one pouch of food.  I ordered this with a bunch of other baby food products all of which were around the same price but contained multiple units.  I guess I didn't read this one carefully enough.  I can't even believe amazon would sell one pouch much less at this price.  Of course, now I am worried about ordering again because food cannot be returned.  Most expensive baby food i ever purchased!

review/summary: Yummy!  But Can Be Found Cheaper
review/text: I got one of these kits at Walmart for under $5.  That being said, the pretzels are so delicious!  The first time I made them, I got as far as kneading the dough and letting it rise before I had to leave for an event.  I refrigerated the dough for a couple hours while I was away.  When I came back and resumed making the pretzels, they were really difficult to roll and form.  They tasted good when finished, but it took quite a lot longer.  The second time I made them, I rolled and baked them right after the dough had risen, and it was so much easier.  Both times, everyone loved them!  The first time, I got about 9 pretzels per box.  The second time, I got 12.

review/summary: convenient and tasty!
review/text: I was throwing a baby shower, bridal shower AND a going-away party within a very short period of time, so I bought a box of Baker's dipping chocolate and also another brand called SF foundue chocolate from amazon. I did use both brands so I get to compare them to each other. I have to say I love love love Baker's! It's really very easy to melt and the milk chocolate isn't as sweet as the other brand (which I like). The consistenncy is also not as runny as SF's. Now, I would have to caveat this: I didn't use any for a chocolate fountain and instead I used both as fondue chocolate, so it isn't fair to judge SF's runny consistency in this instance, since it is for chocolate fountains which need runny consistency. I just find chocolate fountains somewhat tacky while chocolate fondue somewhat sexy! I will definitely buy Baker's again and again and again.

No mess to clean up afterward either. I have had a hard time finding this in the grocery stores though, which is why we recently ordered a case of it online.  We keep ours hidden in my husband's workroom!

The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because even with 2 hours of set up time,the chocolate began to melt instantly within a couple of seconds between my fingertips making them messy to eat.

review/summary: Quick, Easy & Delicious!
review/text: I picked up several of these on clearance at a local store. They've been sitting in my pantry for a couple months now, but last night my daughter asked if she could use one to make chocolate covered strawberries. I told her that was fine as long as I got to have a sample. In less than 5 minutes she brought me a beautiful chocolate covered strawberry that tasted better than expected - this was REAL chocolate, not the "flavored coating" we are sometimes tricked with.<br /><br />The instructions say to heat it up in the microwave in small increments, stirring in between and once melted completely, start dipping! Although we only did strawberries I know it would be wonderful on many things.<br /><br />We look forward to trying out the other versions: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012IS402">Baker's Dipping Chocolate, Premium White, 7-Ounce Cups (Pack of 8)</a> would be great with pretzels and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00110GBII">Baker's Dipping Chocolate, Semi-sweet, 7-Ounce Microwavable Tubs (Pack of 8)</a> which I think might pair well with bananas?

review/summary: So Good!
review/text: These dates are wonderful!  They are moist on the inside and deliciously sweet/complex/creamy/caramelly in flavor. I've bought dates in the past that have a "papery" outer layer that is unpleasant; these do not have that issue.  These are NOT the dates you find in the baking section of your grocery store - nothing wrong with those for baking, but these are much better & good for snacking or eating as they are.<br /><br />I like these for dessert.  I have a 1/2 Cup of plain Greek yogurt (Fage 2% is my favorite) & 1 or 2 of these dates.  My sweet tooth is completely satisfied by the dates and the yogurt is like eating pudding; delicious and healthy.  Also great as an appetizer: just make a slit in the date, take the pit out & put in goat cheese, blue cheese, mascarpone or any creamy cheese.  Warm them under the broiler for about 3 minutes or skip the broiler & eat at room temp.  Or go all out & wrap bacon or prosciutto around the stuffed date & broil for about 4-5 minutes, turning them after about 3 minutes.  The combination of salty and sweet is delicious.<br /><br />The package has the "Packed Date" and the "Best By Date" on the back.  I received my dates on 5/22/10....they were packed on 3/15/10 and will be best by 9/15/10.<br /><br />I have not found it necessary to store the dates in the refrigerator and I prefer to eat them at room temperature.  I just store them in an airtight container in the cupboard after opening the package; of course they aren't lasting long in my house!<br /><br />The plastic container is recyclable:  1 PETE<br /><br />UPDATE 10/2010:  I've now ordered these dates 3 times.  This last time, I noticed the dates are not as nice as the first 2 times...not bad, just not fabulous.  They are a bit more papery skinned & there are dry "lines"/patches on some.  Also, the packer has stopped putting "Packed On" dates on the packaging.  Now there is just a "Best By" date.  I prefer the old way because then I know how old they are when I get them.  The inside of the date is still very good, creamy, delicious.  Perhaps these dates are older?  Or maybe weather conditions have been poor for the grower?  These are an agriculture product grown organically so weather can be an issue.  I'll order another batch when I finish these & let you know how they are.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/2011:  I ordered again & this batch was similar to the previous (10/2010) batch - several (maybe 25%) dates in each package with papery skins & dry line/patches.  However, I still enjoy these eating dates.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/2011:  I decided to order the non organic version of these dates to see how they compare & maybe save a couple bucks.  I concluded that the organic version is superior but the non organic is good too.  FYI/ I reviewed them on their page:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NWIQQI">United With Earth Medjool Dates, 16-Ounce Containers (Pack of 4)</a>

review/text: I bought these dates based on the ratings. Initially, I was very pleased with the product, however, since I use them in my VitaMix, I decided to remove the pits ahead of time. Well, it's a good thing that I did because the second package of four that I opened had 4-5 dates that were literally black inside and had the odor of mold. Just be careful if you decide to order them. I threw mine out because I didn't want to take a chance.

review/text: It's such a pity that for the price they didn't taste better.  Costco medjool dates (though not labelled organic) are far far superior in taste and better in price--- I'd give those 5 stars. Even my husband wasn't impressed with the taste and said the Costco dates were much better. The taste of the United with Earth dates is not consistent.  One might be quite nice and then another might have an odd bitter after taste.  I bought these from Amazon because Costco is about 70 miles from where I live otherwise I wouldn't have bought them at all. I gave two boxes away and I have one and a half boxes left.  I'm thinking of making a cake with the remaining dates because I don't feel like eating them straight out of the tub. I am disappointed.

review/summary: Terrific Dates!  Can't find any better anywhere.
review/text: I used to buy my dates at Whole Foods when they sold them in bulk and I could pick and choose.  They were pretty soft and plump,  depending on the batch/age I guess.  Well they stopped selling them like that,  and began to only carry packaged dates.  I stopped buying them because they were too hard and shriveled for my taste,  and seemed old.  Basically I stopped buying dates all together,  as I had been spoiled from the good dates Whole Foods used to carry,  and couldn't find dates anywhere that could compare.<br /> I'm happy to report  that United With Earth Organic Medjool dates are by far the best dates I've found to date!  (no pun intended)  I am truly a "date snob",  so I am very picky.<br /> We use these dates in our smoothies which we make with plain Kefir and frozen berries.  (4 dates per serving)  They add just enough sweetener to our sour berries and sour kefir to make a delicious smoothy.  Dates are excellent to add to oatmeal, cereal/granola, breads/muffins, or to just eat on their own to satisfy a sweet tooth after a meal.<br /> I am thrilled that Amazon carries these dates.  I'll be a loyal customer!  You won't be disappointed!

review/text: Cliff Bars stopped making my FAVORITE foodbar - Organic Nectar Cocoa & Walnut.  Dates was one of the main ingredients.  I have multiple food allergies and this was one of the only foodbars I liked and was ok for me.  I wrote to Cliff expressing my sadness about discontinued item and was even more disappointed to not receive any response.  So, thanks to the internet and bloggers, I was able to come up with a receipe to make my own Cliff Bar knock offs :)  Thank you!!  I have bought these dates several times and have always been pleased.  Hope Amazon.com continues to carry!

review/text: These are very nice dates although somewhat pricey. I soak them in hot water and once the water is cool, simply keep them in the fridge and have a few a day. After a few days the water that the dates were soaked in becomes very sweet and tasty and it can be used in all sorts of recipes (e.g. muffins, smoothies, etc.).

review/summary: Tasty -- even my kids and husband will eat!
review/text: I got a coupon from a ...well known bulk store... and thought I'd try them out instead of Cape Cod chips. Very pleased! They are like a cross between pita chips and kettle-cooked chips. They have this dry powder flavoring (I assume its a powdered sea salt base) which enhances the taste but doesn't stick to your hands. When we first tried them, they tasted familiar. That Friday we got Chinese food and realized -- they kind of taste like the wontons on a crab rangoon! Dry flat crunchy chip, not greasy, a little thicker. My husband has been eating them with sour cream & onion chip dip and he thinks they would be great with a thicker party dip.<br />I don't know if its because they are a bit thicker, but I find I can't eat as many. Awesome! I used to get lazy and sit down for a movie with the chips in the bag instead of a bowl -- and realize later that I had eaten the whole thing! (I'm a big eater for a thin girl) I sat down with this bag and felt full after about 15 chips.<br />As for the nutritional value? It's 35% of Vitamin A, 4% each Iron & Vitamin C. It's nice to know you're getting that extra vitamin boost, but I will not swap a vegetable for these as a side dish. For us, these are just a nice bonus snack.

review/summary: Happy to eat my vegetables this way . . . . yum!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by these -- they're delicious and substantial -- more filling than potato chips, and even a little bit healthier.<br /><br />Not to be drawn in too quickly by the clever "Eat Your Vegetables" name," I made sure to check out the nutritional content.  Not sure these are quite as healthy as a big bowl of broccoli, but . . . . they're not all bad.  Curiously, although the label touts sweet potatoes, carrots, and navy beans . . . in that order . . . the #1 ingredient in these chips is dried potato.  Followed by navy beans, rice flour, sunflower oil, canola oil, and potato starch follow.  Then comes carrots, sweet potato, maltodextrin, sea salt, onion powder, sugar, konjac flour (whatever that is), garlic poowder, citric acid and natural flavor.  A 1 ounce servine of 13 chips has 130 calories / 60 from fat.  Each serving contains 35% of a day's supply of Vitamin A, 4% of vitamin C, 4 % of iron, and 2% of calcium.<br /><br />These are an excellent stand-alone snack. Probably not a good substitute for real vegetables -- but if you're choosing between a bag of Cheetos and Eat Your Vegetables chips, these are an excellent choice.

review/summary: 35% of Vitamin A--a healthy & tasty snack!
review/text: If you're always on the look-out for a healthy, tasty and unusual chip, these may delight you.  One serving--13 chips or 1 oz.--provides one daily serving of vegetables.  Wow!  They have a bit of a sweet potato/carrot-salty taste although they're fairly low in sodium (only 6% of daily allowance.)  They have a bubbly light texture which is fun. Love the texture. They have no trans-fat and are all natural and cholesterol free and vegan.  The fat content is 11% which is okay--it's from pressed sunflower and canola oils.<br /><br />I love the taste of them--especially knowing they provide a serving of vegetables.  Other ingredients include dried potatoes, navy beans, rice flour, potato starch, carrot, sweet potato, maltodextrin, onion powder, garlic powder, konjac flour, citric acid and natural flavor.  They are a fun sorta crescent shape.  The back of the bag shows them being dipped in guacamole but I find there's enough flavor, I'm happy with them plain.<br /><br />They'd be great to serve at a party as they offer a unique taste, texture and are healthy.

review/text: Wow!  I picked up a big bag at a well-known bulk store because I'm looking for a healthy, gluten-free alternative to my toddler's snack cracker "addiction."<br /><br />We both LOVE these chips!  I feel better about letting him have seconds (or thirds...) and he's happy.<br /><br />The texture is great, very light and crispy!  The flavor reminds me of something, but I can't put my taste buds on it...whatever it is, is good!<br /><br />If you want a change or if your snacking is just empty calories, try these!  ONE serving of vegetables in one serving of chips?  Awesome!<br /><br />Great addition to our new, (hopefully gluten-free), healthier lifestyle...will be purchasing more of these for sure!

review/text: I was sharing with a colleague at work that I decided to quit caffeine. No medical problems, wanted to get rid of the coffee, energy drinks, MD, etc. He offered a bag of Korean Ginseng Tea to try.  Wow! The flavor was not good or bad; however, an acquired taste.  Notice its calming effect. No jitters! No Nervousness! Just smooth.  I sweetened my tea with 1 tbsp of Grade "B" Maple Syrup - awesome.  I received my order as promised.

review/summary: Great Ginseng Flavor
review/text: I bought Prince of Peace Ginseng Tea, Royal King and one other manaufactured by Dongwon Korean Ginseng Co (which I have not tried yet) from Amazon. I opened the Amazon box and the packaging for all three looked pretty much the same. I actually thought they were all the same because of the packaging. I started drinking Royal King and it wasn't that strong in taste. I later opened the Prince of Peace, because I wanted to give away one of the ten little boxes. I tried it on a whim and I was surprised at the very strong and pleasing ginseng flavor that Prince of Peace has. When it comes to ginseng flavor, two of the Royal King packages does not equal one package of Prince of Peace. As of 10/23/2012, this tea will not disappoint in flavor. It tastes so very good. Incidentally, I also drink this tea sweetened with maple syrup.

review/text: A few months ago, I was offered a cup of this amazing tea, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PIMS16">Prince Of Peace Instant Korean Panax Ginseng Tea - 100 Count</a> I was immediately impressed with the fresh taste and the sealed packaging. Upon emptying the contents of a packet, a temporary creaminess arises while the Ginseng bursts into a pleasant aroma. I love a teaspoon of honey in my tea. I've always known how Ginseng gives me an almost instant energy boost. For a number of years, upon arising each morning, I have experienced such positive affects from similar Ginseng products. But the Prince of Peace brand of Ginseng is extremely pleasant and powerful; and almost addictive. So I find myself repeating the delicious infusion several times per day. The only exception is not to have any before bedtime! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PIMS16">Prince Of Peace Instant Korean Panax Ginseng Tea - 100 Count</a>

At the Trident website (makers of Rubinsteins Red Salmon) they claim there is no bisphenol A (BFA)in the lining of their cans. [...].  It does contain the skin and bones of the salmon because the product is cooked and canned simultaneously.  You can buy skinless and boneless canned salmon from Trident under Trader Joe's house label or Cosco's under the Bear & Wolf or Kirkland labels; however the addition of bones adds natural calcium to the product.

review/summary: Broken every time...
review/text: Despite Amazon sending me a replacement order for these, they still came broken (I can only guess that the manufacturer sends them already broken and it's not Amazon's fault).<br /><br />Also, these are NOT spring rolls but rice crackers that you either bake, microwave or fry (they puff up and it's fun to watch them turn into puffy crackers from flat rice paper). One rice cracker round takes about 2 minutes on high in the microwave to puff into a big rice cracker. Children would definitely get a kick out of watching these magically morph into funky rice bonnets (they look like Amish hats to me once they transform).<br /><br />Unfortunately, these were a little on the stale tasting side but still edible with some dips or fillings.<br /><br />I'm curious to try the shrimp ones as my Korean friend told me that those actually have the best flavor.

review/text: This is the best tasting snack I've ever had.  at work they have them in the vending machine, and on a daily basis I get them.  I decided I should order some for myself instead of using all my change in the machine!  They are healthy for you, and taste as though you have scooped up fresh salsa onto a chip.  The brown rice chips themselves are delicious, very light with an interesting taste.  I highly recommend this!

review/summary: Get started making your own sushi
review/text: So you've been paying how much for sushi at those fancy Asian fusion bars? Stop it this minute...start making your own with this nori. It's incredibly cheap, good, and even includes the sushi mat. (Line the mat with plastic wrap...keeps the mat clean and each roll will be wrapped up for refrigerator storage as you roll it.) Use chicken or cooked seafood if you are wary of raw fish (or make vegetarian ones) and don't cut out the slices until ready to serve. There are a number of good internet sites on making sushi...just Google it. Oh, and you'll need <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001DMT1E">Nishiki Premium Sushi Rice (5#)</a> and Nishiki 100% Natural Sushi Vinegar, 10 Fluid Ounces (or their equivalents - lots of competing products), too.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cheap mat, nasty nori
review/text: The rolling mat is very cheaply put together, not impressed at all with it, wish I'd gone for a non-bundled mat, might have gotten a decent one.  The nori is vile-tasting; I normally love nori with my sushi, but no one in my family, including me, could stand the stuff; we all ended up cutting the nori off (peeling left a residue on the rice) and eating the maki with a fork instead.  A day in the fridge only strengthened the bad nori flavor. Awful stuff.

review/text: I bought this product because my wife and I decided to make sushi at home. This offer included sushi mat, and nori were not expensive if to compare to anothers. As first time customer, I can say: I got that I expected for money I was ready to spend. But my suggestion for first time users: go to nearest asia market, if you don't live in country definetely, and buy all of it twice cheaper with same quality and will not pay for delivery.<br /><br />To company: I believe you can grab more customers if will add at least recipies of sushi in your packs and somehow exclude delivery expenses. Your product costs at same price like in Charleston's local stores.<br /><br />with respect to all

review/summary: Great Seaweed Mix
review/text: I have been wanting to make a seaweed salad at home like you get in a sushi restaurant.  I still haven't accomplished that, but this is a good second best.  I throw away the dressing that comes with the salad.  The directions say to soak the mix for ten minutes, but I find it is unbearably mushy if I do that.  I just rinse, drain, and mix it in with my salad.  It's a little salty that way, but it otherwise has a taste and texture like the restaurant salad. (BTW, you only have to rinse and drain as much as you need at a time, just leave the rest in the bag and put a rubber band around it)

review/summary: A very expensive salad
review/text: First up, the dressing didn't come with it.**  Secondly, there are no English instructions.  That's no hill for those of us that would buy this item, but<br /><br />I recommend another soak beyond what's in the illustrations.  Next, it's all one big bag, so you only get one shot at it.  I'd hoped it would've been packaged in 3 or 4 serving sizes.<br /><br />The taste?  Good.  **I had to really take a wild guess at what kind of dressing to use. I made my own soy based recipe.<br /><br />Finally, don't expect the free stuff in the Amazon ad.  It wasn't there either.<br /><br />Save your money and head for your nearest Asian market.

review/summary: Imparts a delicious, sweet shot of Hazelnut flavour!
review/text: This adds a delicious, sweet shot of Hazelnut flavour to your coffee. Black coffee aficionados may not go for these syrups as, well, since this is a flavoured sugar syrup, it's going to sweeten your coffee. But, if you like your coffee a little sweet, with a nice, subtle, nutty Hazelnut flavour to it, this syrup will be right up your alley.<br /><br />I also think that these syrups (I have a bottle of their English Toffee flavour, regular sugar-sweetened, as well), are a nice alternative to the flavoured coffees out there. If you just don't feel like having a slew of different types of coffee in the house, and have a favorite unflavoured coffee that you prefer to use, these syrups are a great way to add a little variety to your cuppa Joe without jam-packing your pantry (or freezer) with too much of a good thing.<br /><br />Since I like my coffee to be very sweet and creamy, I DO add sugar to my coffee in addition to these Da Vinci flavoured syrups, as well as plenty of creamer. I'm confident that a half capful of this syrup by itself will be enough to sweeten your coffee more than adequately, if you just want a shot of the delicious taste of Hazelnut to enhance your coffee-drinking experience. Delicious, and FAR easier than making your own Hazelnut-flavoured simple syrup at home! ;)  Enjoy!

review/text: The quality of the coffee was good (we like Starbucks and stronger coffee) - tasted fresh (which it should be in the fancy box packaging and vacuum sealed aluminum bag).<br /><br />That said, pay attention to your price per ounce. At Starbucks, you pay about $10 for a 1 pound (16 ounce) bag. At the grocery store, you normally pay about $7 for a 12 ounce bag.<br /><br />Here, you are only getting 8 ounce bags!! So, do your math to see if it is worth the money for you.

review/text: I try all of our daughter's food before I give it to her, because I refuse to feed her something that I wouldn't ever consider eating myself.  I like all of the Ella's products, however this is one of my daughter's favorites!  Like the other products mixed with baby rice (brown rice, mind you), it is thicker in its consistency and might need to be watered down with a bit of breastmilk or formula (or water) for younger babies. I definitely wouldn't start with this; I'd try one of the ones that's primarily apples, pears, mangoes, etc.
