review/text: Received as a gift and couldn't have been more pleased!  At only 4 grams of sugar per piece (which is my first consideration; I don't really care about the fat as long as it isn't hydrogenated) I can afford a decadent treat every now and then. I will be savoring each bite....

review/summary: Deeeee-licious!!  But be careful when you order them!
review/text: Some of the best truffles I've ever eaten.  I can't stop eating them!  The chocolate is rich and just the right amount of darkness and the cocoa dusting is perfectly balanced.  The truffle just melts in my mouth.  Yum!<br /><br />The only problem is that they are a winter-only item.  They do not ship well if the weather is warm.  Make sure to observe the weather before ordering - follow the standard rules for the time of year to ship chocolate or you will receive a yucky block of half-melted chocolate.

review/summary: Best thing I've ever put in my mouth!
review/text: I ate a couple of these at a company Christmas party, and I nearly collapsed from the flavor orgasm. Sadly, they were not labeled, and I had no idea who brought them in.  After some searching, and buying truffles that left me disappointed, I got a box of these as a present from my fiancee.  I nearly cried tears of joy.  It's impossible to describe how delicious these truffles are.  The only downside: they melt very easily, so remember to refrigerate, or at least keep in a cool place.  Then again, all good things must be treated with care.

I had a great experience and they were shipped from Amazon...and they were fine. I am sure the other reviews were just a mistake on either amazon receiving practice or the manufacture made a mistake in a particular batch. But you'll love them! I promise! IF you aren't satisfied contact Amazon, they are about making the customer happy!

review/text: I purchased some of these chocolates for my mother for mothers day and had them shipped directly to her....when they arrived they were a melted mess, and in a package that had no labeling on it so she didnt even know what they were!!  Inside the box was a warm "ice pack" that obviously did not do its job.  The chocolate is excellent but wouldt buy and ship from amazon.  I dont know what stores may carry them so if anyone has any idesas would love to know.

review/text: I got this for someone for a xmas gift and she and her friend loved them.  I was going to do another round for Mother's Day and now these are more than twice the price and no free shipping?!?!?  I give this 3 stars for the lack of value now.  Cocoa futures peaked at the end of 2010 which could cause a higher price but there is no possible way it would be over a 100% increase in price and no free shipping is warranted.  From what I have seen looking at other products on here, all chocolate products are jacked up on Amazon anyways.  I'll pass!

review/summary: very low melting point
review/text: These chocolates have that texture that is unique to the tropical oils that they use--a very low melting point.  This means that they melt in your mouth much faster than milk chocolate.  They remind me of an old chocolate candy called the Icecube--they were individually wrapped squares that were sold in a plastic tub by the cash register at gas stations and hardware stores for 5 cents, then later 10 cents.  The truffles have very few (if any?) artificial ingredients.  I Loooovvve them.

review/text: A friend of mine surprised me with a gift of these CHOCOLATE BELGIAN TRUFFLES COCOA DUSTED 1 LB. FOIL BAG ONLY - GIFT BOX NOT INCLUDED.  Exactly the same as advertised on Amazon.<br /><br />I had seen this advertised on Amazon, and it did indeed look enticing....but for some reason, never bought it.  Hmmmmm..... I have ALWAYS liked chocolate truffles, (sold for many years at "The Garden Bakery Shop", in Little Neck, Queens, NY -- until it recently closed, and was turned into a MacDonalds :_(  and, a bit more recently, having tasted Belgian chocolate for the first time, have become a true fan of Belgian chocolates, as well. The very words, "Belgian Chocolate Truffles", seem to combine<br />the best WITH the best, (like winning the Powerball Lottery top prize AND the Publisher's Clearing House top prize, in the same year!), and, though perhaps later buying what promised to be scrumptious little morsels would probably not do my pocketbook very much good, my taste-buds were already cheering in anticipation, like fans at the Kentucky Derby!<br /><br />Well, they sure ARE delicious!  A VERY close second-best chocolate I've ever tasted! (No. 1 place STILL has to go to GUYLIAN Belgian Chocolate Sea-Shells....which I recommend, (heartily!), to anyone who, like me, enjoys the Belgian Chocolate Truffles, herein being reviewed.)  Absolutely yummy, is how these wonderful little truffles taste. Sweet -- but with an underlying taste of '100% chocolate without sugar"....the deeper, richer flavour of all dark chocolate....only here, it is darker, and richer, than in any other dark chocolate I have ever tasted!  In sum -- total yum!  But -- are they truly "truffles"?  EVERY other chcolate truffle I have ever tasted, has GROUND HAZELNUTS as an ingredient.  Here, the word "hazelnut" is not to be found amongst the ingredients at all!  Can it be that makers of NON-Belgian cocolate truffles, (such as I have always had before), add the ground hazelnuts to THEIR non-Belgian chocolates taste a bit like the Belgian chocolates? Or is it that somehow, DONCKELS, (manufacturers of these Beligan truffles), have just decided to leave the ground hazelnuts out????  To me, "chocolate truffles" has ALWAYS meant "they include ground hazelnuts"....but, although THESE chocolate truffles STILL taste VERY good without the hazelnuts, I can't help wondering if they might taste even better WITH the inclusion of the ground hazelnuts(??????)<br /><br />In any event, these ARE truly scrumptious chocolates, which I will now happily recommend to all my friends who like ANY type of chocolate!  They make a great gift...and the beautifully-designed box that they DO come in, really needs no extra gift-wrapping....unless you wish to put in over this box.<br /><br />...................................................<br /><br />As I mentioned, I got my box of these delicious chocolate truffles as a gift....from a friend who probably bought them at a brick-and-mortar store, offline.  WILL I ever by them myself, through Amazon? Well, although I truly do enjoy the convenience of buying through Amazon, reading some of the other reviews, of people who have bought THEIR boxes of thse Chocolate Belgian Truffles here...and who have received only "big white glops of.....SOMETHING", makes me wary of buying THIS PARTICULAR item through Amazon.  (Although I do give many thanks and kudos to Amazon for publishing these critical reviews.)  Maybe I'll buy only one bag....when it is again first available, (and fresh?)  Or maybe not -- maybe I'll just buy it at a land-based store?  It seems to anthropomorpizing-loving me, (that is, I enjoy making -- in my imagination -- inanimate objects into living beings), that the three truffles pictured on the front of the lovely box of these Donckel's chocolate confectins, are positioned so that they appear to be speaking with each other, discussing this, (and perhpas other problems...like, how to keep their price low, but their quality high)?  I surely hope that any of these truffles purchased in the future, contain boxes with CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES, and NOT "white glop".  Like many people, I am one of those who enjoys horror movies on the MOVIE SCREEN -- and NOT in reality, either in my mailbox, my table, or my plate, or wherever!

review/summary: Better Than Buttermilk
review/text: It doesn't happen often that I say this but this product SACO Cultured Buttermilk is better than the real thing.  I first used this over 10 years ago.  I love buttermilk waffles and despite my love for buttermilk on it's own to drink I seemed to consistently end up throwing away some before I used it all.  Not with SACO Cultured Buttermilk.  It mixes well in the dry ingredients and all you do is add the recommended about of water to hydrate it; that is in addition to whatever liquid the recipe calls for.  I've found that even the flavor is better, richer.  Just as with the real deal you must refrigerate it but the shelf life is HUGELY different.<br />I am now using this to make scones but I have made biscuits, dressing, pancakes and cakes with it and all have come out perfectly.<br />Give it a shot you wont be disappointed that it's better than buttermilk.

review/summary: ajika garlic  powder
review/text: I received the garlic powder with 2 others items that I had ordered.  The problem that I had with this order is that there is no paper seal in the top of the jar.  The lid had come loose and garlic powder was all over the other two items.  The other items were wrapped in plastic so I just had to wash the garlic powder from the plastic. I haven't tasted the garlic powder yet but it has a strong garlic smell so I'm sure it's probably very good.  The company does need to something about not having any paper seal between the lid and the powder so this doesn't happen to anyone else.

review/text: I was hoping for a creamy, mocha-type drink that tasted more like mocha than coffee or hot chocolate.  What I didn't expect was a cup of chemical soup!  This has the worst aftertaste you can imagine.  It's like drinking a cup of watery saccharin.  I would definitely not order this again, and in fact will have to just write the expenditure off to experience when I dump the remaining 15 k-cups in the bin.  Hate to be so harsh, but this stuff is nasty!

review/summary: More on the hot chocolate side
review/text: The cafe mocha taste good but is a little week on the actual coffee part. It pretty much tastes like hot chocolate with a splash of coffee flavoring. Prefer to have an espresso taste with chocolate flavoring. Ended up brewing an espresso blend<br />k-cup and then mixing it with a brewed cafe mocha. Made a big cup of coffee that was great for sharing. Tasted more like a mocha you'd get from a coffee shop.

review/text: I am not a huge coffee drinker but I need some caffeine every once and a while. This is alright. It does taste like hot chocolate but on the largest cup setting it tastes like chocolate water. The middle setting is alright but I feel it tastes the best on the smallest cup size. Sometime I will mix 2 of the small cups together to get a decent size drink. I am a fan of the Cafe Escapes line as they taste very good and don't make a mess while making. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a small drink!

review/text: This mix is the best thing that has ever happened to gluten-free! After experimenting with various GF mixes in the past, which all constantly reminded you that it was not the "real thing", Bella's gluten-free mix allows you to create delicious baked goods that will make you forget that it is actually gluten-free. You'll find yourself saying: "I can't believe this is gluten-free! You have got to be kidding me!" But it's no joke. The texture and taste are superb. For the first-time since becoming gluten-free, I am actually able to make my favorite things. It makes outstanding cookies, pancakes and pretty much anything that would generally call for flour. This product has my wholehearted approval! Thank you for creating something so outstandlingly delicious!

review/summary: Really Great
review/text: I've made waffles and pie crust with this mix and both turned out wonderfully.<br />On the waffles I followed the recipe exactly but I separated the egg whites first and beat them until they formed peaks and then added everything else.  This make for light  waffles that were delicious.<br /><br />The pie crust was pretty easy to make just remember to use the parchment paper when rolling the crust out - sandwich the crust between and upper and lower layer of parchment.  The resulting pie crust has a little different texture than flour based crust, it's kind of got a shortbread type texture but I thought it was very good.<br /><br />The quality of these mixes seems very high and I also love the multigrain bread mix.

review/summary: WHAT A JOKE!
review/text: Received this product 15 days after ordering it.  It was shown on amazon to be a 10-oz. bag of Barnie's Coffee Kitchen Kenya AA coffee beans. I received an email from amazon a week after ordering this item, informing me that the supplier, A-A Coffee Growers And Importers had not yet confirmed shipment, and gave me the contact information to contact them directly, which I did.  I heard nothing until 7 days later when I received an email notice from amazon that the item shipped.  When it actually arrived the next day, I opened the package to find a vacuum sealed plastic pouch with an unmarked coffee bean paper print bag containing what I assume is coffee beans.  It was definitely not the Barnie's Coffee Kitchen bag shown on either Amazon or A-A Coffee Growers & Importers and,in fact,had no identification on the bag whatsoever.  Could be from anywhere.  I expected to get what I actually ordered, as shown. How silly of me! It's going back!!

review/summary: OK for an alternative snack
review/text: Purchased this variety pack and although I was VERY impressed with Amazon Prime shipping (I literally received it in less than 24 hours!), the snack itself is average tasting.  Mostly like flavorless cardboard.  The best flavor is the jalapeno one, pretty spicy.  It satisfies the crunch and salt factor, but no way is this a replacement for real chips.  I recommend PopChips original flavor which reminds me of Munchos, or PopChips BBQ flavor; both are satisfying and taste very good.  I would NOT purchase these Gourmet Basics Smart Fries again.  I even joked with my co-workers when they asked me what I was eating.."They're Smart Fries, but they're not so smart since they don't taste that good!"  They tasted for themselves and they all pretty much agreed with me.

review/summary: Too Salty for Me!
review/text: I'm really disappointed in these, unless for some reason I got a bad box of them!  I've been buying the plain Pop Chips for over a year now, very happy with them but was looking for something new.  Well, these are too salty for me,,,,,I can't eat them.  So I'm giving the entire box away tomorrow to get them out of here.  What a bummer!  That's the problem when you try something new with Amazon in the food category, you have to buy a boatload,,,and if it doesn't work out, you've wasted $20.00.  I don't  see what the point is in air popping something so it's low in fat but then making it way too salty,,,,sure defeats the purpose in my viewpoint.  Not good,,,,I'm really not pleased.

review/summary: Healthy and delicious, wish they were cheap.
review/text: For the cost this is not a good snack but if you don't mind how expensive they are then these can't be beat for calorie counters. A single bag offers tremendous taste and fulfillment for such low levels of calories and fat. My wife loves Popchips and I don't count calories but we both love these fries (mostly). Brief flavour rundown:<br /><br />Jalapeno is very hot. Tastes good. If you like jalapeno, you'll love these.<br /><br />Honey Mustard is the best flavour. Rich, bold, strong taste, very flavourful and high quality.<br /><br />Sea Salt is good but bare and basic.<br /><br />Honey BBQ is great. Weak BBQ flavour compared to most potato chips but still quality.<br /><br />Vinegar is decent, pretty good vinegar taste, again weak compared to most potato chips.<br /><br />Vintage Cheddar is the poorest of the lot, with a dry and musty white cheddar taste, which though real, tastes fake.

review/text: These smart fries are a great alternative to the usual chips, pretzels, and tortilla chips. You get a heap of pieces for 110 cals (I think about 60), and it definitely does satisfy that salty snack craving I get from time to time. As for the flavors, we got the 6 variety mix. Some were definitely good (the BBQ and japapeno ones were best in my opinion) but others were a bit rough to get through (like the vinegar/salt). Regardless, I definitely plan to get some more in the future.

review/text: I just bought a box of these salt smart fries and gave them to my kids trying to get them on a healthier diet. they loved them!!!! They said that they gave it out to their friends and so it seems that they all loved it! I got phone calls from their mothers asking were I bought this great snack from. There was a perfect hint of salt and definently not to salty like other reviews. I just ordered the 6 flavor case as the reviews were amazing. Thank you for making such a great snack.

review/summary: A lot of Crunch & Munch for 110 Calories
review/text: This is a huge portion for 110 calories - if you like your chip snacks but find the usual, 10 tiny crisps in a bag 100 cal packs to be more frustrating than satisfying, give these a try!  They are lightly salted and seasoned, and best of all I recognized everything in the ingredients as being actual food, not something from the lab!<br />Oh, and super fast shipping from this seller!

review/text: I love cheese-flavored snacks and I was highly disappointed by these. Their styrofoam texture was offset only by putrid tang of faux cheese powder. I'm pretty sure the only good Smart Fries flavor is salt and vinegar.

review/text: Last time I went to the store(Big Lots) I was just looking around for a moment and my mom spotted the Smart Fries, she knows that I am calorie conscious. She grabs the Smart Fries and tells me, "look these have 80% less fat". We bought the product of course, when we got home I was hungry and ate half the bag my mom ate the other half. They were delicious, crunchy, airy texture, also great flavor, low in fat and calories! I want to buy more.<br />My mom is not calorie conscious and loved the fries.

review/text: This is by far the best alternative to french fries.. they are low calorie & so light to eat. I will definitely keep ordering them & reordering them. I love the fact that they give an assortment of flavors in each box. My family & friends are constantly asking for another flavor to try.... Good job making these Smart Fries...

review/summary: Not bad, not great...
review/text: I personally did not like these, but I gave the rest of the box to my mother and she had me order two more cases.  These are probably a good item for dieting because you think you are getting a lot for the calorie amount, but the flavor to me (and my husband) was sort of gummy and styrofoamy.  I could not finish a whole bag.  That didnt mean I was full, that meant I had gotten tired of them and wanted something more satisfying.  It is like eating a pound of celery when you really wanted a grilled cheese.<br /><br />By the way, I love the Pop Chips.  Much more flavor.<br />And my review was up for no less than a minute when I got a "not helpful" so I am not sure how this is not helpful, but the company requested that I write a review. If they are not happy that I didnt like the product, that is too bad.

review/text: I was attracted by the packaging and the ingredient list. I mean 100% natural, potatoes, cracked pepper, sea salt... sounds like a winning combination!  Except that it isn't.  These things are worse than eating nothing, because they have calories but leave me unsatisfied, so I'll go eat something else 5 minutes later. A perfect example of why people think they don't like to eat healthy.  Yuck.

review/summary: Need Improvement
review/text: Love Pop Chips and thought I'd give these a try.  First of all, I should say that the flavors are really, really good.  However, something in the manufacturing process ensures that very little flavor actually "sticks" to the fries.  I wish they could somehow infuse the flavor INTO the fries themselves.  As they are, they are like eating little pieces of styrofoam with a tiny bit of flavored powder on them.  As soon as the enter your mouth, the flavor comes off and you're left to chew and swallow the tasteless piece of styrofoam.  They use plenty of seasoning...it's just that most of it ends up in the bottom of the bag.  Dry powder just doesn't stay on a dry fry very well.  These have the potential of being very good.  And it's a good sized snack for the calories.  I just wish the actual fries had some flavor, instead of just the powder that falls right off.

review/text: I loved the idea of this snack. As others mentioned, enough crunch and volume that it is hard to finish a bag. The flavors are not that great. I really like Honey Mustard and Onion flavored snacks but the smart fries, not so much. My six yr old loves snacks but not even the cheddar was appealing to her.

review/text: This was the first time I had any issues with an order from Amazon - and the vendor handled it quickly and generously!  My order came in from the shipping company in a rather squashed box and I thought it was okay at first, but once I got a better look, the bags inside the box all had been pushed on hard enough to have small holes, so I emailed the vendor through Amazon and they responded the same afternoon that they would ship out a new box with the product I had ordered!  I think these smart fries are the best snacks and my two year old loves them too, so we were very excited about the quick resolution!  Thank you!

review/summary: Salted Styrofoam - But Low-Cal!
review/text: Gourmet Basics indeed! I think the basics are to keep it simple and let the natural flavor of the food shine through. I am blown away that they have actually managed to make a "natural food" taste faker than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00346J90Y">Andy Capp Hot Fries, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>. Rice cakes have a luxurious mouth-feel compared to these. I couldn't get past the fake flavor and horrible texture.<br /><br />I just can't imagine what type of odd palate people must have to think that these abominations are tasty. Perhaps people who are on a restricted diet might find these a convenient snack food. Or parents tricking their kids into eating healthy. I can almost promise the parents that these snacks will go uneaten. I would have been more likely to eat the unsweetened Baker's Chocolate in the pantry before I'd eat these.<br /><br />Though this product might be suggested by Amazon if you purchase Popcorners or Popchips, do not buy it. These are nothing like Popcorners or Popchips, these "Smart Fries" are nothing but awful.

review/summary: You eat potato snacks for potato flavor
review/text: I really like potato snacks and have not tried many that I did not like. This one however, I felt I had to report my experience. These are the worst potato snacks I have ever tried. not only do they not taste like potatoes, but they are also very bland as well. Put it this way, I received a case of 12 3oz bags and I opened one bag and ate about half the bag. The rest I had to throw out and I won't even inflict coworkers with this product by leaving them in the break room for free. Instead, I plan on using the bags as shipping protection to fill empty space inside a few boxes I have outgoing. That's right folks, packing material. That's what these excess bags of smart fries are good for.

review/text: After reading all the raving reviews I decide to order the 6-Flavor variety pack.  I tried the Honey Mustard & Onion as well as the Sea Salt.  The Honey Mustard & Onion has a decent flavor but it fades almost as soon as you start crunching.  The Sea Salt had almost no flavor at all.  The texture is great, a bit like a skinnier, more crunchy (yet light) Cheese puff.  I love the texture, I love the idea but the flavor needs to be amped up CONSIDERABLY.  I wish I hadn't purchase so much since I don't want to eat them.

Other flavors might be ok....cheddar cheese seem like they might be interesting. Again, not up to Pop Chip quality in my opinion.

review/summary: Very very tasty snack
review/text: Attracted by the packaging, I purchased a bag [of the Classic Sea Salt flavor] in a local 'gourmet market'.  At 110 calories, I suspected that I had been, as frequently happens, fooled by the 'serving size' (you know how it goes, 2.5 pieces = a 'serving' - so there are actually 7 'servings'/bag)  BUT, NO, what a pleasant surprise - 110 calories was for the WHOLE delicious bag!  They're non-greasy, light as a feather and unexpectedly filling - I almost couldn't finish the bag.  I noticed they were produced here in NY, which I also liked and, after going online to find out more about them, decided to splurge for a case [of 1 oz. bags] to try all the varieties.<br /><br />One ounce doesn't sound like very much but they are so light that it is actually a very full bag and definitely more than enough for a single serving.  (The 3 oz. bag contains substantially more then you would want for just one person)<br /><br />Favorites so far are:<br />Honey Mustard & Onion<br />Vintage Cheese<br />Classic Sea Salt<br /><br />I don't have kids but I expect these would work extremely well as a lunch box addition.<br /><br />My only suggestion to the company would be that it might be a good idea if they made them available for purchase in smaller quantities.  I'm afraid many people will be put off by having to purchase in 12- & 24-bag sized cases.<br /><br />But, if you do decide to purchase, I also have no doubt that you'll have no trouble sharing them with friends and will probably be back for more sooner than you expected.

review/summary: Best, Healthy and Low-Fat Alternative for Cheetos Puffs!!
review/text: I purchased the variety pack and have been able to try out all the flavors. This Vintage Cheddar variety is one of my faves. If you're a Cheetos Puffs fan and want to cut back on calories and fat, this is the product for you.<br /><br />The texture in both are similar -- light and airy. So is the taste. Of course, it's not an exact match, but nothing else on the market this low in fat content comes close. (And I've tried several alternatives.)<br /><br />To compare nutritional info on a 1-oz. bag, Cheetos Puffs contains 160 calories compared to Gourmet Basics' 110. As for fat grams, Cheetos Puffs has 9 grams and 1 gram saturated versus GB's 2 grams of fat and 0 saturated. On the flip side, the sodium content on the GB is higher at 340mg compared to Cheetos' 250mg. Carb count is also higher in the GB at 22 grams as compared to Cheetos' 16.<br /><br />I'm sold on this product and my next order will be for a carton of this flavor alone.
