review/summary: Poor Quality!! Bad after taste...makes one vomit!!
review/text: Don't buy this product....makes you vomit.  Cheap....cheap product.  A concoction of junk herbs...prob cultivated in some cheap backyard quality settings.  Herbes de Provence should be smooth, good quality and not to overpowering in taste.  It is very delicate when mixed with eggs, or when baking a chicken.  This product has a bad after taste....you get what u paid for.  Poor quality.  This product should not have any rating.  Should be taken off the market. -0 star should be the rating.

review/summary: Excellent palm-sugar soy sauce for marinating and grilling
review/text: I use this as a marinade and basting sauce when grilling satay, steak, pork, salmon, and chicken.  Make an easy satay marinade by combining Mae Ploy brand Yellow Curry Paste ( high in lemon grass ), lime juice, creamy peanut butter, some sambal olek (or substitute red chili flakes), and a little canned coconut milk ( optional ).<br /><br />Friends that have tried it love it. I tell them I do not really think of it as a condiment, however, I sometimes pour in a small drizzle on rice or use as a dipping sauce.  It is a molasses-like combination of palm sugar and soy sauce. I always try to keep some in stock in my kitchen.

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: Couldn't make Indonesian type foods without this. It is the sort of standard Indonesian condiment, you see this bottle and its green sour counterpart on every table in every little warung in the archipelago practically. This is sweet soy sauce, so it has sugar in it and it has a syrupy consistency (so don't buy to replace your kikkoman, it is different stuff. The green 'kecap asam' bottle is your more standard variety).<br /><br />Little known fact but kecap (pronounced ke-chap) was the sauce English people were trying to imitate in creating ketchup (though those early varieties of ketchup were not tomato based, and this product has next to nothing in common with Heinz 57!).

review/text: I had never heard of sweet soy sauce.  I got some Indomie Mi Goreng, which I love, and one of the four flavor packet had a sweet soy sauce.  I was entranced.  It tasted a little like molasses but different.  I order this because it had so many stars.  I love it.  Thick, rich and sweet.  The bottle is huge and I got two of them.  I have been adding it to everything I cook.  I had a beef cutlet and rather than bread it, I smeared it with this and fried it.  I was amazed.  I haven't found anything it doesn't taste good on.  A real winner.

review/text: I ordered this after trying some sweet soy sauce in an asian restaurant, the shipping was very fast, and it was packed securely. These bottles are a generous size, and I am well-stocked now. I also ordered some Healthy Boy Dark Thai sweet soy sauce at the same time, and the Healthy Boy is really good as well.....it seems a little thinner in consistency, and a little milder in taste. I will use both of them in my favorite Asian dishes. Do try this.......I discarded the regular soy sauce [supermarket brands] that I had in my pantry. Never going back to those now !!  I highly recommend this, and the Healthy Boy sweet soy.

Kecap Manis Sweet Soy Sause is the perfect addition to teriyake marinades for chicken, beef and fish.  The thick sweetness brightens marinades and also adds a perfect thickner to glazes. I use this sause (as it is sweeter and thicker) to regular soy sause.  I love the fact that it comes in big bottles, and through this venue is reasonably priced!  Will be making another order soon!

review/summary: Okay, not fantastic
review/text: My cat loved the smell of these when I opened the container, but she had some trouble eating them.  The treats look like and are about the same size as Cheerios, but they are very hard and a little too big to easily pick up.<br /><br />I ended up breaking them in half, which made them easier for her to grab, but I don't think she enjoyed how hard they were; she quit eating them after just a couple of pieces.  The treats don't smell like salmon at all, the barley being quite a bit stronger.<br /><br />In the end, these were just okay.  I liked that there were just the three ingredients and they weren't packed with artificial colors, flavors and preservatives.  I just wished they had been a tad softer.  I'm going to try adding a little water to soften them to see if she'll eat them that way.

review/summary: Great value
review/text: My wife and I eat anchovies by the pound. No, not on pizzas or in salads only. While we agree that these (Moroccan) anchovies do not match in taste the Spanish anchovies from Calabria, we both think that these anchovies are great. The taste is right. They taste a little saltier than calabrian anchovies, which suggests they stayed in salt for a bit longer, but the salt content (according to the label) is actually slightly lower than the salt content of the calabrian anchovies. The soy oil is not a problem and it is light enough so as not to make a difference, compared to similar (Moroccan) anchovies packed in olive oil. You may find bones too, but as I said these anchovies seemed to have been kept in salt a little longer so the bones are almost dissolved. The price is outstanding - 730 g of these anchovies cost less than 55 g of Ortiz anchovies. I recommend these anchovies wholeheartedly.

review/text: I ordered two pounds of Scott's Cakes' Raspberry Butter Cookies, hoping that they would live up to my high expectations. Well, they most certainly did! I can no longer find what I consider to be tasty raspberry butter cookies in local bakeries or supermarkets. Either they are not available or the quality is alway disappointing. Not so with these scrumptious treats. Soft, buttery cookie dough, with really delicious, slightly tart raspberry centers--not the bland, starchy raspberry fillings that seem to be universally prevalent these days. Well done! I'll be ordering more very soon.

review/summary: Best espresso brand takes over american coffee
review/text: If you are walking in Rome and you see a Bar that brews Illy coffee to their customers, I would suggest that you walk in and have your espresso there. You won't regret it. It is just a better espresso!! I can now say the same for american coffee. Since I started drinking coffee in the US, I was curious to try all the different brands: the affordable ones and the very expensive ones. Illy Medium Roast for drip coffeemaker is the best I have ever had. I use a very cheap coffeemaker and the coffee still comes out good. My only objection to Mr. Illy is that he should try to lower the price. [...] bucks for 8 oz. is a little to expensive for everyday coffee!!

review/text: I had great expectations when I ordered these rices cakes. Received my box today and tried a cake right away.  I think my tongue is dead because I could not taste the buttery caramel flavoring that was supposed to be on these cakes.  There was a coating but  not enough flavor.  This part breaks my heart to write.  I held off ordering the rice cakes so they would not be shipped in the middle of winter and ordered them now so they would not be shipped during our rainy season.  I did not want stale rice cakes.  My strategy did not work.  The one cake I tried was almost stale but still edible. I put it in a toaster oven to dry it out a bit and that helped though the coating got tough.  Went ahead and ordered storage containers from Amazon. Will give an update on whether storing the cakes makes a difference.

review/summary: Perfect cat treats!
review/text: My cats go NUTS for these treats!!!  I've been looking for a cat treat I can give to my cat who is allergic to any type of mammal or poultry protein (have to get food from the vet) and these are just fish plus some barley and vitamins (see ingredient list).  Most treats have a chicken or beef base, even if they're fish flavored.  What a relief to find these, and the glucosamine/condroitin is just a nice bonus, since my cats are getting a bit older (9 and 14, respectively).  Oh, and did I mention they LOVE THESE TREATS?  The allergic kitty spends lots of his free time sitting in front of the cabinet where I store these treats, looking wistfully at the door.  (Um, isn't it all free time for cats?  Right.  He pretty much lives in the kitchen now...)  Try these!!

review/summary: Zukes Hip Action
review/text: I had been buying Cosequin from my vet for my slightly overweight (OK .. obese) cat Jackson.  It cost $45 per month.  It was helpful for years, but recently he had begun limping again (at age 14).  I learned of Zukes Hip Action and decided to try it just for fun.  Jackson is now jumping on furniture, no longer limps and has a silky smooth coat .. all in about 6 weeks.  AND .. it costs about 1/10 as much and Jackson LOVES it!  Strongly recommended.

review/summary: I'm in shock!
review/text: When I took my 15-year-old, overweight cat in for a senior wellness exam, the vet. said the x-ray showed serious arthritis.  I just thought she wasn't getting out of her cat bed because she was elderly and tired.  The doctor prescribed Adequan, but either I didn't get the medication into her muscle properly (entirely possible) or it just didn't work for her; I saw no difference.  I tried Cosamin, but my cat seems to be able to smell it, no matter how carefully I mix it in, and won't eat even tuna if it has that in or on it.<br /><br />Then I saw these in a store.  Although I was certain they wouldn't work and doubtful my finicky cat would even eat them, I figured, What the heck -- it's worth a shot.  Wow!!  After a few days, she started perking up and moving around, and now she acts more like the cat I knew a few years ago.  She even "smiles" more!  And crucially, she still loves these treats -- she doesn't seem to get tired of them.  She is (as I mentioned) overweight, so I give her 3 a day.  I wish they would make them in more flavors than just chicken and salmon, but like I said, so far, she hasn't gotten tired of them, even without the extra variety.  Thank heavens for these treats!

review/summary: Hip Action for Cats - Excellent treatment!
review/text: My vet put my cat, Ranger, on Hip Action after Ranger started limping and we discovered his patella was slipping off his knee joint.  It was painful to watch him limp around the house and up stairs.  Shortly after starting the treatment with Hip Action, my cat stopped limping and regained his agility.  Now, several months later, he is as active and athletic as he was years ago!  I no longer cringe as I watch him go up stairs, jump on his food counter, etc.  I think these treats are excellent and effective! (Hip Action was the only treatment we used with my cat - nothing else.)  He even seems happier and more comfortable and asks me to play tag with him all the time again!  On top of it all, they've very affordable (especially compared to the alternatives).

review/summary: Cat loves them and they seem to have actually helped!
review/text: My cat is 12 and is hyperthyroid (but can't take traditional meds) and has the beginnings of kidney failure.  She's on lots of meds and vitamin supplement treats and isn't very happy about it so I was afraid she might not take to the  new "treat".  She's always been a snuggler and has never been a cat who has played with toys (got her at 10).  It never occurred to me that she might not be interested in toys because of arthritis.  On a recent trip to the vet an x-ray was taken and the vet pointed out the arthritis all along her spine.  That made me wonder how much of her not playing was in fact the arthritis and not just the older age.  It's been a week or so since I started giving her these treats and she has started playing (with my hair ties).  She bats them around and is jumping around trying to get it.  She has played with my hair ties a bit in the past but never this actively.  I definitely think it is the Zukes supplement that is helping.  I also think this is her "favorite" treat since I put a plate out of all of the supplements and the Zuke's one has been the first gone the past few days.  (Fyi my cat is picky about canned food but has never been picky about treats or dry food.)

review/summary: FANTASTIC!
review/text: So I bought these treats for my cat, Gucci. He's 3 years old, and has carried a bit of excess weight most of his life. Even through continuing efforts to bring him to and maintain a healthier weight, he has never been much of an agile cat. He struggled just to jump onto the couch sometimes. I never thought he may have been having joint issues until my vet mentioned it. Which led me to try these.<br />First, both of my cats LOVE the flavors. They gobble these things up no problem, which is saying a lot for Gucci who is a bit picky. As for whether or not they actually work, I am a firm believer that they do. About a week after starting these, I watched Gucci leap from the doorway of my bedroom all the way onto my bed in a single bound. He now runs up and down his cat tower as if he were a kitten again. I'm so glad I decided to purchase these. I would recommend them every time!

review/text: My cat is almost 12 years old and he was moving very slow and watching him walk up the steps to our door made me feels bad for him. Since starting him on Hip Action he has become very youthful again, he tears out after our others cats like he is a kitten again. His coat looks so healthly.<br /><br />So glad I spent the money for him.

review/summary: New cat - my grumpy old man is my kitten again!
review/text: My cat, Pluto broke his hip when he was a year old. He had surgery to have the hip ball removed. The doc said he would have ten years but after that he would be in pain but by then something should come out that should help.<br /><br />Pluto is 12 now and has been in pain for the past several years, six months ago it was getting to the point my husband and I had "the talk"<br /><br />My vet recommended Nutramax Cosequin for Cats and Zuke's Hip Action Natural Cat Treats. Pluto gets one each night and it's like I have my kitten again. He is playing and is able to jump without pain. We give him the Cosequin first which is a pill he Hates then he gets the Zuke's treat which he Loves.<br /><br />I highly recommend both!

review/summary: Vet recommended
review/text: At her last checkup my 19 year old cats vet recommended I try these for her.  He said that he had heard about them giving older cats some relief from arthritis and was going to start stocking this item in his office.  I ordered the salmon flavor and was at first a little put off by the price for what appeared to be cat treat size packages.  That is true but for my cat's weight I only give her one a day and we are still on the first package and she has been taking them for about six weeks.  I find that to be very cost friendly.  She is not a very big cat treat kind of cat but took to these and now daily expects to get one in the morning.  They are semi-moist which means they do not fall apart and get crumbly in the package.  I break them in half and she eats both pieces with ease.  They are about 1/2 the size of a dime.  Now that she has been on these for six weeks I can say I think they have helped some.  Enough that I will continue to give them to her.  She is more mobile and comes down the stairs more frequently.

review/summary: Great Product. Really Improved My 19 Year Old Cat's Quality of Life
review/text: My very elderly cat has severe arthritis in one of her hips. There is a constant clicking when she walks and every few months she will limp around for a day or two. I tried Zuke's in hopes it could help her some. It has worked wonders! It's not a cure, but it has greatly reduced the number of times she limps around and the duration of those periods. She also has less pain on a day to day basis. You have to be realistic when your cat is 19 about what to expect. She loves the flavor and will eat these even on the days she doesn't have much of an appetite. I can only imagine how much benefit it would have for a young cat that was only 13 or 14 :) So, if you love your kitty and he/she is not as catty as it once was try Zuke's!

review/summary: Five strikes against these treats
review/text: OK.  I admit it.  Cats can be finicky.  They can be very picky about wet food, so I wouldn't write reviews about canned, wet food.  But treats are another matter.  I've tried a lot of treats.  Usually, one of my three cats will eat the treats.  I have one who is picky, one who isn't particularly fussy and one who is a chow hound.  I keep seeing healthy treats and trying them.  I am such a fool!  As my cats started getting older, I worry about their mobility.  I tried some Omega-3 salmon oil and that was a fail.  I tried some of these treats.  Not one cat would eat them.  When I leave food out for them, sometimes it will eventually get eaten.  Not these.  So I gave them to an office mate at work who has two kittens.  Neither of his cats would touch these treats.<br /><br />I can't attest to the effectiveness of these treats.  But if you are looking for a healthy treat, try another brand.  It seems that these treats are disliked by lots of cats.  I'll give two stars instead of neutral three because so many cats won't touch these treats.<br /><br />What's a good Cat Parent to do?!<br /><br />PS.  My cats all like Whisker Lickins tartar control treats, so I've signed up for an Amazon subscription for them since they price is the best.  I think you would be hard pressed to find a cat that does not like the WL treats.<br /><br />PPS. Every one of my cats loves Trader Joe's Tuna for Cats and it was the only food my deathly ill cat would eat for several weeks.  It probably saved her life.

If you your cat is fussy but they like stuff like Laxatone, give them Feline Joint Gel. She practically does a happy dance when I get the tube out. And I can really see a difference in her ability to jump up on furniture when I give her the glucosamine supplements. Just not this one.

review/summary: Another flavor failure for a healthy kitty treat
review/text: Well, we keep trying different kinds of treats, hoping to find one our cats will eat.<br /><br />We have a 5-yr old cat who has some hip problems due to a steep fall as a kitten.<br />We thought some glucosamine/chondroitin might help him as much as it helps us.<br />We always bought glucosamine food for our older dog, who very much enjoyed it.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the product.  First off, it smells very funky, even to my nose!<br />Chicken?  What type of chicken?<br /><br />Our older cat will eat virtually anything chicken flavored, but he won't touch this one<br />at all. They look like they were cut from an extruder tube, like little dark tynenol tablets.<br />(I'll take some photos and post them later. I know lots of cats are picky about the shape of<br />their food.) I've tried breaking the pieces into smaller pieces for him - nope.<br />I even tried waiting until he was starving (like right before dinner) and he still turned his nose<br />up at them.<br /><br />I then tried leaving some out for a few days, since he likes the dry crunchy treats better<br />than moist ones. Nope. All he did then was try to bury them. Even our little cat, who loves<br />the moist treats, would not touch this one.<br />When I pick up the bag, I get a stink-eye look from the cats, and they walk away from me.<br /><br />So, back to the drawing board. Some people's cats might like them, but neither of ours would touch them.<br />Another expensive mistake. I think Hubby and I just need to create a tasty, healthy treat for cats ourselves,<br />because the mfgs are not doing such a hot job in this area.  Although, I think dogs would probably<br />love this item.

Two months ago my 15 year old cat was limping everywhere and it hurt to watch her walk. We have been feeding her the treats daily, four for the first month as directed and the maintenance dose of two daily afterward, and the difference is amazing.<br /><br />She wouldn't go near anything treated with Cosequin, actually doing the turn and scrape derision action any time I put it on her food.  She loves these and begs for them.  If your cat has the same reaction to Cosequin, definitely give these a try.  They're easier to use, cost a lot less and cats seem to like them.

review/text: This product is great as usual.  Most people know callebaut chocolate so I wont elaborate on that.  HOWEVER what i will elaborate on is the seller.<br /><br />I have never ordered meltable or perishable items online that have ever came to me in any kind of usable condition.  BUT, culinary direct packaged this stuff so well that even after 5 days on a ground shipment from California to North Carolina, by the time I finally got through the packaging, the tape, the bubble pack, the ice pack, the chocolate inside was unmarred and not a single disc had even smudged the outside of the packaging.  I can NOT believe the amount of care that went into this package and the fact that even with such a small amount they took the time to provide the best product experience.

review/summary: Delicious Rusks (what IS a rusk?)
review/text: I was buying a couple of tubes of these toasts in our local store and was asked in the checkout line "What are those and are they good?" The answer is, they are rusks, or a sort of toasted bread similar to the "zweiback" (twice baked) and so they are twice baked: once to make the round loaf, and once, when sliced, to be toasted.<br /><br />These are eaten as a traditional bread or cracker in many countries (The Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden, the UK, even Brazil and most of the Central and Latin American countries.) You find a form of these served usually at breakfast or tea time with your coffee.<br /><br />The Dutch style rusks here are very tender and crumbly compared to some of the others you can buy (which is why zweiback is often a teething aid--it's a hard biscuit.) These are large, 3" diameter rounds are very good with butter, marmelade, jam, even peanut butter or sprinkled with chocolate jimmies (Chocoladehagel or chocolate hail) which is a Dutch children's treat but not one I'm fond of. Some people spread Nutella. I simply like butter and a dab of marmelade.<br /><br />This makes a great non-sweet tea bread, and they go camping quite nicely too, substituting for toasted bread.<br /> Comment | Permalink

review/text: After making gingerbread houses and cookies just for the fun of it for the children old and young I know, I needed to find a bulk quantity of egg white to make the royal icing with. Those  3 ounce cans that are widely available just get too expensive. Amazon is equivalent to Google in the manner that search and ye shall find.

There are no instructions with the product, so you're kind of on your own as to how to use it.,

review/summary: Not my cup of tea
review/text: Tea is very subjective.  If you are looking for a tea that does not taste like Rooibos but more like black tea then this may be perfect for you.  As a forty something Afrikaner who has drunk tea his whole life I'm not a big Twinings fan. Numi is an easy to find brand of Rooibos teabag and I much prefer the flavor to the Twinings offering.  If you want the tea bags they buy and drink in South Africa buy the Freshpak here on Amazon<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001590IC">Freshpak Rooibos Tea 80 tagless bags (2 x Pack)</a> .  If you want "real" tea you'll need a kettle and a tea pot. I use 3 tablespoons of Davidson's Organic Rooibos <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SATIE6">Davidson's Tea Bulk, Organic South African Rooibos, 16-Ounce Bag</a>in a 1.3l pre heated teapot.  Making the tea with freshly drawn boiling hot (212�f/100�c) water and a Swissgold filter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQ7KLG">Swissgold TF 200 Tea Ball</a>.  Let sit under a tea cozy for 5 minutes.  Then you will taste a true cup of Rooibos made right.

If you dont, you'll never finish the six-pack.<br /><br />And remember- this is naturally caffeine free!  If you think decaf teas taste like sludge, taste this for something uncaffeinated that's totally different.

I like to drink it with a packet of Sugar in the Raw over crushed ice with just a dash of lemon.  Really smooth and refreshing!  It isn't very strong tea so if that's your thing I would use 2 or 3 bags per serving.  It's caffeine free so it's ok to do that.  Try it out and you'll see!

review/summary: Rooibos tea is great
review/text: I fell in love with rooibos tea (aka red bush tea) in South Africa.  It's almost the national drink, at least for breakfast. When I returned to the USA I found that many supermarkets carried it.  Unfortunately it was always flavored with something.  Like vanilla.  That's ok but but when you want the pure stuff, you want the pure stuff.<br /><br />Then I was at a friend's house who had Twinings with no flavorings.  She could not recall the supermarket she purchased it in and my visiting N number of them got me nowhere.<br /><br />A Google search got me to Amazon which had about the best price.  Reliable and quick shipping.  I bought two cases.

review/summary: Tastes great, a nice break from green tea
review/text: I usually drink green tea, flavored white tea, or herbal peppermint. I decided to give this Twining Rooibos a try on a whim. Very glad I did. I think it tastes great, although very different from the traditional green and blacks. In researching it, it isn't a true tea but still offers a wealth of similar health benefits and better yet is caffiene free. I haven't tried any other versions of the tea but this brand can be found locally, is inexpensive, and to me at least is great tasting. As I don't drink pop, juice, or coffee being able to find a tea like this to mix into the rotation has been a great find. Plus according to the internet this tea will help me live to be 150, so to borrow a from quote Carl Spackler "So I've got that goin' for me which is nice" :) All kiding aside though, I would recomend giving Rooibos a try. I will likely try some other brands out now as well, but for the price and availability, Twinings is a good start.

review/summary: Calming, mellow-tasting tea
review/text: Rooibos tea is great for healing skin conditions but it's also great for your mental health.  I'm always so nervous and anxious and chamomille tea is not as great tasting and calming to me as rooibos tea.  The great thing about this tea is that you can benefit from this wonderful medicinal herb without it tasting like the usual flowery herbs (like licorice, flowery herbs/roots/leaves, mint, hibiscus, rosehips, etc.) which is what i hate about Celestial Seasonings Tea and why i moved away from Twinings blackcurrant tea when they changed the formula.  I used to drink Twinings blackcurrant tea regularly until they changed the formula to something bitter & stronger with the strange yucky tasting floral herbal components.  Then I switched to rooibos tea because of the health/taste benefits and found Twinings to be the cheapest locally.  I buy mine at my local Walgreen's for the cheapest local price, but it looks like you get a more bargain deal here on Amazon.  It tastes like mellow nutty hay and you don't really need much sweetener to sweeten it up.  Double your health benefits by adding raw organic honey.  The longer you steep it, the more the herb tea will seep out its benefits.  I've heard bathing in it regularly will heal skin conditions.  The best rooibos teas (in teabag form) in the US i've tasted with attractive packaging I'd give as a gift to a friend are the artistic "NUMI" and hearty "Republic of Tea" rooibos teas but they're much more expensive.

review/text: I can see that many people like this tea, which surprises me--but there are plenty of teas for all of our different tastes! I'm only writing a review to warn non-tea drinkers not to assume their guests or gift recipients will like it.<br /><br />I drink hot tea--but only black tea--continuously throughout the day and someone gave me three boxes of this as a gift because it was reviewed highly on Amazon. :-) I've tried several cups, thinking I could do something with it to make it palatable to me, but I can't.<br /><br />I think both the dry tea bag and the final product have an unpleasant aroma. The taste of the brew is offish in some way and the after-taste isn't pleasant to me either. I served it to two friends and one thought it was good but not as good as other Rooibos she had tried. The other friend sipped for awhile and left it. She commented on the dried grass smell, which was what I didn't like either. I can tell that a lot of people like it--I just wanted to warn that many might not.

review/summary: Pure rooibos, but very weak taste
review/text: I first discovered Rooibos tea while on safari in Africa. During the safari they would take a break and bust out some coffee and tea. On the first morning I tried the tea, and I was hooked. The flavor was fruity but not too sweet. Drinking it was very smooth, and a wonderful experience. I didn't drink any coffee the entire safari trip, just Rooibos tea (and I love coffee).<br /><br />So I'm on a quest to find that taste once again. After trying another brand, which had some additives I didn't like, I searched for pure Rooibos tea. I thought I found it in this product, but turn out it's still not quite there. This tea is definitely pure Rooibos, but it's not wrong enough. It's like a watered down version of what I had in Africa. If I use two bags per cup, then it's closer, but still not great.<br /><br />My quest continues to find the perfect Rooibos tea.

review/summary: Unexceptional Rooibos
review/text: My first cup of Rooibus was Numi which was very good to excellent. The only problem with it was the cost, about six bucks for 16 tea bags, locally, the Twinings was half the cost but so I decided that I should give it a try, I was terribly disappointed with the taste, aroma or lack of aroma, I also noticed that it didn't have a nice red hue like the Numi, it's more of brown color. I seriously doubt that I will finished the box, especially since receiving a 16 oz Bag of Davidson's, which I find very satisfying.<br /> Davidson's is my first bag of loose tea, it's a little extra trouble, but I believe that I will begin to prefer loose tea, I am already beginning to experiment with the recipe.<br /> In summary, with all the positive feedback for the Twinings Brand Rooibus, I would say give it a try, it's not expensive, but then try either the Numi or the Davidson's, with taste being so subjective, it's impossible for me to say which you will like the best, but I hope there is one that you will find satisfying.

review/text: Could not find the Tassimo pods for about 3-4 months.  Ordered these, which were the same product..... maybe a little cheaper.  Got to use my Tassimo once more.  Wrote to the Tassimo company without any help whatsoever, so was glad to be able to acquire the pods once more.

review/summary: Lots of Fun
review/text: I recently bought an espresso machine that had a basket for pods.  I thought I would give some a try and Pod Merchant seems to carry them all (I lived in Italy for several years and Pod Merchant has some Italian coffee brands that even I've never heard of).<br /><br />The sampler packs are a fun way to try different brands.  Some are better than others, but trying them out will keep you from later ordering 100 of something you don't like.<br /><br />The order was processed quickly and they were delivered no problem via UPS.  There were also a couple of "freebie" pods and a coupon as a thank you for the order which I thought was a nice touch.

review/summary: Great selection, but be cautioned
review/text: I bought this sampler to use in a Breville Keurig Cup coffee maker (there is an insert you can buy in order to use coffee pods rather than K-cups.) After working out a brewing method, I put the pods to good use. The sampler gives you many different types of coffee to try and I discovered some new coffees that I liked quite well. But keep in mind that "decaf" is a somewhat fuzzy concept overseas, especially with manufacturers that do not sell a lot of coffee to the U.S. I noticed a buzz from a couple of these pods that I wasn't expecting.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: Just bought a new espresso machine and wanted to experiment with different brands of pods, so this was perfect for me.  I didn't find any that I did not like.  Only problem is there are so many different brands that it is difficult to remember any given one that stands out to you.<br /><br />Individually wrapped pods is the ONLY way to go--so much quicker and easier than grinding your own--especially if you are single or the only one that drinks espresso in your household (no waste).

review/summary: Moist Chocolate Cake
review/text: My absolute favorite is German Chocolate Cake but I've found it to be a mix that can often turn out dry.  That is not what I want in a cake.  My sister-in-law substituted chocolate cake mix last summer and that is our new tradition.<br /><br />This mix is my family's favorite because it is just what it says... SUPER MOIST.  The rich chocolate flavor compliments my Grandmother's recipe for homemade buttery, pecan and coconut frosting.  Add a thin layer of warm frosting to the cake layers and let it soak in deep. Once the frosting is cooled, frost as usual.  I make a three layer cake in a heart shaped pan then display it in a glass domed cake plate.  This cake is warm, soft and delicious served the same day and even more flavorful the next day.<br /><br />The kids love the cake mix when you add chocolate chips and make cupcakes.  Vanilla frosting and sprinkles top off their favorite.<br /><br />More recently I used it to make a chocolate gooey butter cake.  Made the recipe as written but substituted chocolate cake mix for the yellow cake mix the recipe called for and added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to the cream cheese topping.  Rich and decadent.  Yum.

review/text: Making a cake from scratch is not difficult, but using a cake mix makes the job pretty darn easy.  This is a really good one for chocolate lovers. Good price, too.

review/summary: Not QUITE a chocolate lover's delight
review/text: My family started putting chocolate chips in a chocolate cake mix quite a while ago, then usually cook them in cupcake pans for chocolate-chocolate-chip muffins.  When I saw this mix, I thought, right on! They've done it for me!  Unfortunately, they use mini chocolate chips (which pretty much blend into the surrounding cake) and not enough of them, so it doesn't quite add up to the Chocolate Lover's Dream Snack/Dessert.  We don't frost them, however; maybe that's the extra needed "push" to make it a 5 star rating.  Frosting costs more than the cake mix, however, so I try to stay away from it.  If they would have used regular sized chocolate chips, and a few more of them, you would be able to taste them and notice when you bite into one.  As it is, tho, you won't.
