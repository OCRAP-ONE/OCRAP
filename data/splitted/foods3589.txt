review/summary: Cinnamon Hot Chocolate
review/text: This is a great-tasting hot drink.  It's easy to fix.  You can add a little cream or more sweetener, or nothing, and it still tastes good.  My husband and I spent Christmas in the mountains this year, and it was cold. There's nothing like sipping Cinnamon Hot Chocolate in front of a blazing log on Christmas Eve.  What more can I say?  It is good!

review/text: This is the best hot chocolate we've bought.  No exceptions.  No brand is better and we've tried several.  I bought it first at a grocery store because of the Mannheim Steamroller name.  Didn't realize they were into hot chocolate as well as music.  It turned out to be -- delicious.  When we couldn't find it at the store, I checked on Amazon when I was buying something else.  It is great to round out an order to make $25 for free shipping!  The hot chocolate is made in water not milk.  Sometimes I add a teaspoon or so to my coffee for a little mocha flavor.  This is just the best!!

review/text: I found this wonderful hot chocolate mix during a pre-Christmas shopping trip.  We really enjoyed it and when I went to buy more, I couldn't remember where I had purchased it.<br />The information on the package had a website and fortunately I was able to locate it through Amazon.com.  Even better, it is a product that is available all year round.  For an item that is usually related to the holidays or just a winter item, this is a great discovery.

review/summary: Delicious hot chocolate
review/text: The cinnamon flavour of this hot chocolate is just strong enough, and not overpowering. It's almost like using a cinnamon stick to stir your cup of hot chocolate. Very smooth, even if it's made with just water instead of milk. I received this as a gift and I will definitely be buying it again when I run out.

I went back & bought all they had.  That was a couple of years ago.  They never got anymore.  I therefore have to buy it online.  Sometimes, the shipping is as much as the canister making it ridiculously expensive so I am happy to see it is once again, a super saver item!

review/summary: Best Hot Chocolate Ever!
review/text: This is the best hot chocolate I have ever had! I have been trying many different kinds lately, and nothing comes close to this. I prefer a hot chocolate mix that blends and tastes great with water, rather than having to heat up milk (a task in and of itself). This hot chocolate is rich and flavorful. I originally was introduced to it as a gift in my Christmas stocking. I was terrified to try it for the longest time because I am not a fan of cinnamon flavor and imagined it would taste like an Atomic Fireball in Swiss Miss. I was completely wrong when I finally broke down and tried it! The cinnamon flavor is extremely subtle, and adds just the right amount of uniqueness to to it so that it is not like every other cup of hot chocolate. It also tastes very good mixed in with a cup of coffee, and makes for an overall smooth drink.<br /><br />Beware! Once you try this hot chocolate, you make not be able to buy anything else again...

review/summary: Brilliant in Everyway!
review/text: I have been drinking Mannheim Streamroller's Cinnamon Hot Chocolate since the year it came out.  It has been a staple in my family every year since.  The first year it came out, my mum and I through a huge Christmas Party.  We made Mulling Cider and two big professional coffee containers of Cinnamon Hot Chocolate.  They went in under an hour!  That's how good it is.  I grew up on Chip Davis and Mannheim Steamroller.  I was supposed to goto American Gramophone, in Omaha, last week.  Unfortunately, a huge blizzard tore through and I was stuck in my hotel room downtown.  I've always wanted to visit and get some products at their home office store.  Yes, if you live in Omaha, you can drive to Mormon Bridge and get some wonderful products from Chip Davis, direct. :) Buy this product!  You're mouth, body, stomach, and soul will be warmed and delighted all winter long!  So far, this year, I've purchased 8 Cinnamon Hot Chocolates.  Trust me... it's that good!  And... the best part of all... it has very little guilt when it comes to counting calories, fat, sugars, and carbs.  You will actually be surprised!  I drink lots of this stuff and I'm still really skinny! :)  Happy Christmas to all and to all buy this product!

review/text: Thank goodness for these HappyTot pouches! My two-year-old is going through a picky phase and we rely on these pouches to get in the veggies. If we put a sweet potato in front of him, he would likely turn up his nose, but the minute he sees one of these pouches he is clamoring for his "cinmin."  It seems like a lot of companies are now jumping on the pouch bandwagon with applesauces and other fruit sauces, but I love that these HappyTots have fruit AND veggies, as well as the added nutrition from Salba, which is a grain. I had never heard of it before looking at the packaging, but after doing some research I can see why HappyTots have it as an ingredient! It is an ancient grain that is high in omega 3s and fiber. It is gluten and wheat free too, so I didn't have to worry about giving my son these pouches before he outgrew his wheat sensitivity. I keep several of these pouches (in different flavors too for variety) in my car so my son can have a healthy snack on the run. So much healthier than goldfish, and no crumbs in the carseat! Also love that these are 100% organic.

He calls it 'candy', which is fine by me. The only downside is that these do not appear to be organic, when compared to the Cliff Kid Twisted Fruit.

review/text: Per ounce this Extra Virgib Olive Oil with natural Garlic costs less than grocery store offerings of Garlic Oil. Some of these are frequently other oils and chemically flavored garlic. For me who is a lover of strong garlic flavor I added a bit more garlic to meet my taste. (Too bad it doesn't come in mild, medium and stong garlic flavor.) If one still deep fries this package of three is ideal. It's great for salads, frying, veggie dishes, mashed potatoes instead of sour cream or butter and many other dishes.

review/summary: Auguri Garlic Flavored Olive Oil
review/text: I had decided that just for fun, I wanted to try what I thought would be better olive oil than what I was buying at Walmart and Sam's, so I thought I would look at my favorite online store, Amazon.com!  While I wanted to try good olive oil, I still needed to keep within some kind of budget.  When I came across this olive oil, it sounded so good, I just had to try it, and we have not been disappointed! It has a great flavor, and although you can taste the garlic, it is not overpowering, by any means.  It has a good consistency, and I like it so well, I am thinking about trying their lemon version.  I am thinking it will be great in salads.  With the garlic flavor oil, I have mixed a little bit with some balsamic vinegar, and it makes a great salad dressing!  And as for price, I think it is VERY reasonable, since you get 3 34 oz. bottles of it.

review/summary: O, this is GOOOOOOOOOD!
review/text: Yes, I've had garlic olive oil before and loved it.  But recently I have been experimenting with cooking and have discovered (yea, I'm slow) cooking with garlic olive oil make everything so tasty and makes cooking so easy easy easy.  When I bought this 3-pack, I figured I'd give one bottle to my sister (both she and her daughter cook) and maybe one to my mom or my brother...but now I think I'll have to keep them all for me because I'm going to go through this stuff very fast.  Having the garlic in the oil like this makes the garlic flavor so smooth--and I don't have any problem with garlic delivered this way (crushed, chopped sliced, etc. garlic in food often upsets my stomach although I love the flavor).  Put it on salad.  A wee bit in a pan and dump fresh spinach or other greens in and mix it around a little.  Use it on baked potatoes and in place of butter in mashed potatoes.  On meats.  I need this stuff in bigger bottles!  I also like that they come in plastic bottles because I tend to knock bottles over as I'm cooking so this avoids breakage.  Now, I just have to decide whether to buy another 3-pack now or to wait until I'm down to my last bottle and hope I can still get these.

review/summary: Economical and delicious!
review/text: Love this garlic olive oil and I'm glad it's back in stock.  I use it for sauteing/marinades and other times when I want olive oil but I'm not looking for a particularly delicate flavor. It's nice to have the garlic already included in the oil.  I also like that the oil adds flavor without getting bitter the way fresh garlic sometimes can. If I cook something I want to be more garlicky I usually add a little fresh garlic near the end, but much less than if I started with plain olive oil.  I get fancier olive oils for things like dressings or bread dips, but this is great for everyday use. I should note that it's in clear plastic, so it's not heavily protected from the 'elements' and probably wouldn't store for a long time, but that's not a problem in our house and it's never been a problem in the shipping/delivery.

I did sign up for the auto-delivery program and will probably choose the Rosemary flavor for my next shipment.

review/text: If you like Miso Soup you must have this.  The price is fair, the delivery is perfect, the product is a 'must have' in Japanese comfort food.  Why get fat for lunch when you can get Nagatanien Instant Miso Soup?<br />6 flavors and 2 servings, just remember that a Japanese 'cup' is 160 ml, not a 250ml US cup. If you have never<br />tried it get a couple (2 to 4) little sushi and make a bowl of this soup.  With a cup of tea you'll have all the lunch you want, and all the lunch you need.  Is this why the Japanese outlive us?  Who knows? but this sure is good.  If you travel this is one you can pack a few bowls of, a bowl, a spoon and a little water boiler. When you stop at the Rats Nest Hotel for the night you have a great little meal (no need to mess with that Motel coffee that looks like it's been there since the last owner left). Give it a try.  :-D

It does have a nice texture though and a traditional chocolate appearance to it.  I've seen these at several local health food stores and they were discontinued in each as they didn't sell well so maybe others had the same opinion as me.

review/summary: The very best Hoisin Sauce available !
review/text: Being an afficionado of Oriental cuisines, I can say I've tried many different sauces claiming to be "Hoisin Sauce" and that the Koon Chun brand is without a doubt the best I have ever eaten.  Whether used for moo shu dishes, a marinade for ribs, chicken or spread onto a Peking Duck pancake, its thick, rich flavor is surpassing.  Used sparingly, a little goes a very long way, and puts many of the thinner, sometimes watery, imitators to shame. Even given the seemingly high shipping price I recommend trying this out and think you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was the first time I spied it on the shelf of a local oriental supermarket and decided to try it out.  Since I no longer live within comfortable distance of an oriental market, I now order this through Amazon every few months and always try to keep a supply on hand.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I always have.

review/summary: EXCELLENT Hoisin/Plum Sauce!
review/text: I love Mu shu Pork.  When we order at Chinese restaurant, they call the rich dark sauce included with it "plum sauce".  But when I ordered two "plum" sauces, neither were anything like the wonderful "plum" sauce I love.  One of those was simply awful (like sugary syrup with almost no plum flavor)... the other one was much stronger and more flavorful, but not the flavor I was looking for.<br /><br />So apparently the chinese restaurants I order from incorrectly call the sauce "plum" instead of "hoisin".  Either way, THIS SAUCE IS ADDICTING and DELICIOUS!  Can be used for other dishes (like Chicken), I'm sure, but especially delicious on Mu shu pork type recipe.  LOVE IT!

review/summary: Excellent and multi-purpose
review/text: Bought this based on the reviews, and through Amazon because the Hoisin Sauces at the local grocery stores were pretty nasty - some being downright harsh.  Initially thought hoisin might be an acquired taste, but our taste buds tend to be `adventurous'.<br /><br />This hoisin sauce is a winner!  I love to use it as a barbecue sauce as well - great with chicken, pork, and beef barbecue, as well as a marinade, as another reviewer suggested.  For those who wish, you can add a bit of water and mix well to make a lighter dipping sauce.  I use this as a sandwich spread on spiced roast beef as well - tends to balance the flavor since this hoisin is slightly sweet in flavor.  I also mix it with a little olive oil and toss halved mini new potatoes to roast.  The uses are fairly endless.<br /><br />Buy this for your Asian cuisine, but don't be afraid to experiment!  Yes, it's costly, but if you can't find it locally this is worth the price over other hoisin sauces.

review/summary: A Tasty Snack That Leaves You Satisfied...
review/text: Combos come in a variety of flavors, cheddar, pizza, Jalapeno, etc.  They also can come as a cracker or as a pretzel.  The Combos Cheddar Cheese PRETZEL blend is a tasty snack that leaves you satisfied.  I am no stranger to combos, my favorite happens to be the Nacho flavor.<br /><br />When it comes to flavor the Cheddar Cheese Pretzel combos are flavorful, and don't have an over salted-aftertaste you sometimes find with salty snack foods.  They do come off rather plain however, and the pretzel is a little overpowering.  Compared to the Cheddar Cheese CRACKER version, the Pretzel combination is the weaker of the two.  The cheddar cheese blend also lacks that a slight sharpness and has more of a Cheese-Wiz taste.  Nothing terribly wrong with that but it just feels like the weaker of the bunch.  The pretzel portion was crispy and fresh, having that pretzel-nugget taste to it.  Just the right amount of thickness and saltiness.<br /><br />OVERALL I'd say the Combos Cheddar Cheese PRETZEL combo is  4 stars.  The product makes for a very tasty snack, and will satisfy your cravings for both pretzels and cheese, but falls short of some of their other combinations.  I personally feel the Cheddar/Cracker version is the better of the two when it comes to "Cheddar Cheese" flavor(The pretzel portion overpowers the cheddar).  Still, if you got a craving for pretzels and cheese this snack will certainly hit the spot.

I bring a bag to work and it lasts two+ weeks to fill the gap between a small breakfast sandwich and lunch. If you like pretzels and cheese this is a no brainer. I found the cheddar cheese/cracker to be blah. Of all the Combo combinations I have tried, this is my absolute favorite. Other flavors like pizza overpowered the snack in my opinion. Stick with this one unless you love the other flavors. In any case, try them all in small portions and I'll bet you come back to this cc/pretzel combo. It's good!

review/text: My husband and I love this "relish" - or what we always end up calling " THE garlic chutney."  It isn't hot at all, so don't expect a true Indian kick or anything, but the flavors are delightful!  The pieces of garlic are such a delight, and this stuff tastes great mixed with pretty much all curries, kormas, masalas, etc.  Sometimes we will heat up some puppadum or naan and just use the relish as a dip.  And if I'm sitting at home with no idea what I want for lunch, I'll actually just mix it in some rice by itself (just a dab!  it goes a long way!)  This stuff is the best! And if you are in North Carolina, try to hunt down some of the chutneys/relishes by "Kerala Curry" (a small company in NC). The corriander chutney is a great companion to this garlic relish, although 20x hotter, and we love EVERY one of the cooking sauces we have tried by that company!

review/text: This tea is delicious. I love the combination of flavors, it is very full and fruity. It is the right amount of flavor and has a very refreshing flavor. The loose tea leaves are amazing, and you can tell how fresh this tea is. I would choose this tea over another brand any day. Strongly recommended.

review/summary: Fruity tea-lovers dream
review/text: This tea is made of melon and peach which gives it a sweet flavor but not too fruity. It has a nice spice-flavored after taste and light level of caffeine which wakes me up but doesn't make me crash later in the day. A great find!

review/summary: Must try Pick Salami
review/text: I am from Europe and this Salami is something I always crave and drooling for! This is the first "food" my parents always have ready for me, when I get back! I always sneak out few pieces back to US.... I almost died when I found My salami on Amazon! I've just had about 10 slices and I have a feeling that I am back in Europe! Let the butcher cut it very thin, and I promise to you, you will love it as much as I do. Definitely MUST HAVE !

review/text: Was thrilled to see Hungarian Pick back on the U.S. market. Thought I'd found a decent substitute in Molinari hard salami, but nothing beats this!  Found the taste a little smokier than I'd remembered, but after I'd cut into it and was in the fridge a couple of days that faded and was just as I remembered.  Definitely the best hard salami ever made!!!!

review/summary: Best salami ever
review/text: This is the best salami ... period!  I could eat this salami every day it's so yummy. It has a smoked bacon flavor with pepper, and other spices that are just perfectly balanced.  Even the simplest sandwich using two slices of bread buttered and several slices of Pick salami is amazing.  It's awesome with Hungarian pepper, bell pepper, or sliced tomato.<br /><br />The salami itself doesn't require refrigeration, but it lasts longer in the fridge.  The best by date is 90 days after production. I used to make Pick salami sandwiches to all day trips when I didn't have a cooler. Once you try this it's definitely going to become your favorite!<br /><br />Make sure you peel off the skin before eating it.  Paper doesn't add to the flavor!

review/text: We ordered this sausage yesterday morning, and it arrived mid-afternoon, today.  That's FAST!  PICK Hungarian Sausage is wonderful stuff.  It's a very firm sausage, with a high fat content, making it kind of juicy, if you can use that word to describe sausage.  It's also quite salty, but not unpleasantly so, with mild seasining.  This stuff will leave you craving more.  Obey your addiction.

review/text: My male Rottweiler has allergies and can have these snacks without worry.  Unfortunately, they are hard to find, extremely expensive at more than $10 a bag (about 14 small bones,) and the shipping and handling costs are KILLER.  Omega Paw is not at all interested in making the product more easily accessible or selling in bulk.  Frustrating.

review/summary: Great for sensitive stomach, and last quite awhile.
review/text: My dog has a very sensitive stomach and is on an almost vegetarian diet.  He LOVES these bones! I was afraid they would only last about one minute, but he gets about 15-30 minutes of chewing pleasure from them, so they are a great snack for him.  Every dog is different, so some might just devout it in a couple of minutes, others will get longer.  My dog is probably a medium chewer...he was a really destructive chewer when he was young. We get the small size bones. He is a scotty mix, about 28 lbs.

review/text: They are as hard as steel!! I purchased the small size for my 40 lb dog. I gave him one and watched him. He was struggling so I took it and attempted to break it in half. I am 34 years old and 240 lbs and I could barely break it in half. There is no way i was letting my dog chew on it. He would have no teeth left. MUCH TOO HARD!! Save your money and find and clean up an old piece of steel instead. PLease be careful if you give these to your pet.

review/summary: best green tea
review/text: My dad is a life long tea drinker and he "train" all of us kids to drink tea from an early age.  With age and travelling, I've seen and tried countless tea but my basic, favorite, cant-do-without tea is green tea.  Ten Ren Green tea (the tea bag variety) is the best of all the green tea tea bag I've tried.  it's refreshing, fragrant but not overpowering, quency my thirst, particular soothing after a greasy meal.  It's good hot or cold.  I used to stock up when I visit Asian stores.  And always regret when my stash runs out.  I'm so happy to find it in Amazon.  So dependable and convenient.  Just love it.

I recently got a breville coffee maker that came with an assortment of cups. Most of the coffee that came with it were OK, but this Italian Roast stuff was horrible! I took one sip and dumped it.

Personally, I like the grainy texture so like everything, it's a matter of taste and preferences.  I recently had to take an unexpected trip out of town and it was so nice to be able to grab a few packs of these cookies to throw in my bag.  The individual bags are small but are the perfect size for "one serving".  I have missed animal cookies ever since I had to start eating gluten free.  I might be 65 years old, but yes, I still eat animal cookies :-)). I was so glad to find some good tasting gluten free animal cookies finally!
