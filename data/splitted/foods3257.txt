review/summary: Cheddar good, parmesan garlic bad
review/text: Some of these are quite tasty, but all are too salty. Way too much sodium.<br />The cheddar flavor is kind of like different-shaped cheetos, quite tasty.<br />Parmesan garlic on the other hand is terrible. Extremely garlicky with no parmesan taste at all, and too salty.

review/summary: Popchips
review/text: I love these; a low calorie way to get that "barbeque potato chip" taste. Still somewhat high in sodium, but healthier than regular chips. You really do get that barbeque potato chip taste! If you are trying to eat healtier or lose weight this may satisfy your "potato chip craving".  I really like the barbeque flavor. Great single serving for portion control. (It's easy to eat too many chips without knowing it!)

review/summary: A Great Alternative to Regular Chips
review/text: Popchips are really a great snack and not just an alternative to regular chips but a full on replacement as far as I'm concerned. The taste and texture are great for the Jalapeno ones. I hate greasy fried chips and often switch the baked version of any chips. Now I have another choice...POPPED! If you like flavored chips and you want something crunchy with a great taste then you owe it to your self to try a bag of Potato Popchips!

review/summary: Delicious alternative (all but the Sweet Potato variety)
review/text: I really like these. They are 3 points plus points on Weight Watchers and are much cheaper than the WW branded BBQ chips. My favorite flavor is the salt and pepper.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />They created new flavors and I enjoy most of them. However, the Sweet Potato Popchips are now my least favorite Popchips. The flavor and texture just didn't translate well to the Popchips style chips. They tasted odd, almost burnt. Salt and Black Pepper as well as Cheddar remain my favorites.

review/text: Chips were fresh and securely packaged. It was not cost effective to pay retail and have to wait for delivery. Where was the advantage...other than to compensate for poor distribution throughout their stores? I like the chips (especially the cheese) and will continue to buy them. They are very pricy, so I will by them when I see them.

review/summary: Garlic, Salt, Pepper, Chip  Enjoy
review/text: I have always enjoyed this flavor of popchip and they are highly addictive.  Which makes the money saving 24 pack such a deal.  The problem with the the 3 oz. is that you eat them until your in a coma and the rest go stale.  The 1 oz. allows you to stop sooner without wasting good food.  I don't like the extra bags to through away but the 3 oz wastes food and money.  I actually found that at the time I purchased these the 24 x 1 pack here was cheaper than the 12 x 3 pack.  My only hope would be that they introduce a larger resealable for less.  These chips with their simple salt and pepper flavour go with almost everything.  So enjoy.  Bonn Appetite!

review/text: Saw these chips about 9 months ago and bought the BBQ  at a Giant store in their organic section.<br />These chips are light but tasty and have a good BBQ flavor.<br />Of course they aren't  Herr's or Lays but a good for you substitute. These chips are popped like pop corn. The package explains the process.<br />Trader's Joe's, sells their version for $1.99 a dollar less than Giant but I swear they are the same chips with different names.<br />Try them.

Although I love salt and vinegar chips, I wasn't crazy about their version.  The sour cream and onion and the cheddar were also so-so.  Out of all the flavors, original is my favorite.  You don't feel you're compromising anything with this alternative chip.  Way to go PopChips!

review/summary: Yummy low cal chip
review/text: I ordered a box of 24 of the variety pack of these after trying a couple of different flavors from my cafeteria at work.  This is a really great alternative to chips and they are really flavorful.  I typically take a sandwich to work everyday and was buying a small bag of pretzels or baked chips in the cafeteria.  I found these and they have the same texture as a chip, but have fewer calories and taste better.  After trying the variety pack, I really love the BBQ flavor the best.  My husband really loves the sea salt and vinegar flavor.  I do enjoy the cheddar potato as well, but we are subscribing to receive the BBQ and the salt and vinegar on a periodic basis since those are our favorites.  The original is rather plain, the parmesan and garlic is very garlicky, the salt and pepper is OK, but I'm just not a huge pepper fan so I'm probably not a good judge.  I really don't enjoy the sour cream and onion which is interesting because I do enjoy that flavor with other chips.<br /><br />So bottom line, great chip, great alternative to other chip options.  Low calorie, low fat, and the subscription option is really convenient since I can't seem to find the individual bag option at any store in my area.

review/summary: the garlic parmesan pop chips
review/text: If you really love lots of garlic, you will love these. I like garlic but these have too much.....the garlic overrides the taste of parmesan so they might just as well call these garlic chips. You will have the garlic taste in your mouth for a looooong time.<br />In spite of that, I do love the pop chips especially the barbeque(which is strong but good) and the cheddar. I also like the plain but only when I have already eaten something spicy. The other varieties aren't bad either. I like these chips because they also help my cravings and I can eat them and have been able to lose weight which I really have needed to do. Although more expensive than traditional chips, I look at it as a trade off for a more healthy lifestyle.<br /> I only gave a 4 because of the overly garlic "parmesan garlic" pop chips. Otherwise I would have given a 5.

review/summary: My favorite brand of chips
review/text: When I first heard about Popchips I thought they'd end up tasting like either kettle cooked chips or Cape Cod style chips. I was wrong. They are light, airy, and have a great taste to them... (a note to the makers of Popchips, however, there does need to be better quality control - I will randomly get a bag of chips that are, for lack of a better description I'll say "harder" than the majority of the batches I buy.)<br /><br />The Salt & Pepper variety is the flavor I love the most. It has a nice kick to it (if you're not into heat, you might want to stay away from this flavor and stick with my other favorite 'original'... otherwise, just have a bottle of water nearby.) I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is a lover of chips.

review/text: I was really excited to try these out as salt & vinegar has always been my favorite flavor. I have to say that the taste is spot on but the texture was off-putting for me. I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again. However, the two positives are that they are significantly cheaper on Amazon by almost a $1.50 per bag and have less fat content than baked. If you're a fan, this is a great choice.

review/summary: Healthy Chips at a super price
review/text: If you are addicted to potato chips, or just love snacks, you may want to grab some of these.  I picked up my first bag at a store about 80 miles from home because they are low in fat.  The flavor is excellent and they are crisp and fresh packed in what looks like a foil package.  At only 4 grams of fat per ounce, these are the best flavored chips I have found.<br />Buying from Amazon brings the chips to my door at less cost than buying at a local store and I don't need to spend my time or money for transportation to get them. They are well packaged in the box and each bag is sealed with a volume of air that keeps it from squashing and breaking the contents in transit.<br />All in all a great flavorful low-fat snack that hits the spot.  if there is any negative at all, it is that with 12 bags in the cabinet, I need to ration them to myself so I don't pig-out on them.  Enjoy !

Plus if you are extremely fastidious, you will undoubtedly enjoy the uniformity of size and shape that these chips have.<br /><br />Like Pr*ngl*s they are made from potato starch rather than actual sliced potatoes, but unlike those and other similar brands, they do not leave me feeling like I ate spoonfuls of vegetable shortening after consuming half a bag.<br /><br />The only other flavor of Popchips that I like are the plain original flavor. The other ones have poorly constructed flavor profiles in my considered opinion. Sometimes if you want to go lowfat, you really need to go simple with the seasoning, and it doesn't get much simpler than salt and pepper.

review/text: I absolutely love Pop Chips.  They give me the crunch and flavor that I want and I don't have to feel guilty when I eat them!  Perfect portion size in the single serve bag.  I have tried 3 of the flavors (original, BBQ, and green onion) and the BBQ is the best yet.

review/summary: I see why they're called POPchips!
review/text: First and foremost, shame on me. I thought these were going to taste like dry, boring, bland chip replacements. Imagine my surprise halfway through the first bite. It has the tang of a regular chip with BBQ flavor, but has the light and non-salty taste of a healthy snack. I literally had to hide the bag to prevent eating them all in one sitting. With a nice glass of sparkling water, they are a true treat and a great alternative to the usual processed chips we've all come to know, love, and mindlessly consume. I truly suggest you open your mind and buy a bag. These were absolutely wonderful to have as a late night snack, a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, and something to share with the children in my life. After one bag, you might not want to share.

review/summary: Delicious low fat treat.
review/text: Popchips are the best find I have found in a long time.  You want to eat healthy, and at the same time sometimes, you want something yummy.  Regular chips are high in fat, low fat chips give you stomach problems, baked chips taste not good to me, Popchips a little bit of heaven.  4 grams of fat vs. 10 of regular chips, they use sea salt, they crunch, and to me taste like regular chips minus the grease.  As usual, things that taste good and are made healthy cost more than the high fat item, that is just the way it seems to work.  However, this treat in my opinion is worth your money, as so many other healthy treats are expensive and taste not so great.  I hope you will enjoy them I do and my family does too.

review/text: I have been a long time seeker of junk food substitutes to help maintain my weight. I will never again, and I repeat, NEVER, buy another baked chip again. These are by far, the best "healthy" chip in the biz! Parmesan Garlic has got to be the best flavor, but sour cream n onion come in at a close second. I order these, box after box, and have never been disappointed. If you are on the fence about whether to try them, go for it!

review/summary: This picky eater loves them!
review/text: I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is "sweet" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account.

WOW ~ very tasty!  around $1.25 a bag with 3 servings (I open the bag and immediately put them in snack bags), it's about 50 cents a bag.  Well worth it with a weight watcher points plus value of 1 !  These are also fantastic by crumbling them on top of casseroles after cooking.  They have a lot of flavor to offer!  I can't say enough about them.  Buy and find out for yourself ~ give yourself a treat!

review/summary: Popchips are amazing!
review/text: An entire bag of the 3-ounce Popchips are only 360 calories and are very low in fat. I can snack on this or even replace lunch with some of them. There is just the right amount of salt and, despite being produced very unlike traditional chips, the expected crunch is still present. The only complaint I have is that the material of the chip is actually fairly coarse and if you're eating them quickly, I find the roof of my mouth gets a little raw.

review/text: I have tried all of the flavors of Popchips and the Original is my favorite.  You know those chips Munchos that you get at convenience stores?  Well, these kind of remind me of them but they are: 1) tastier, 2) less salty, 3) less processed tasting and 4) better for you.  These are great snacking chips, good with dip, but definitely great on their own.  Crunchy and delicious!  If you like potato chips, you will definitely like Popchips.  Only thing that is weird is that some of the bags are saltier than others - I am not sure why.

review/summary: Healthier alternative for chip fix
review/text: In the last 8 years or so, there's been a potato chip Renaissance in the US.  I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a "sometimes" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer.

review/text: As any dieter knows, it is difficult to give up one's favorite snacks, especially if you crave salty, crispy chips.  I have kept 40 pounds off for 2 years, and these Popchips have been my go to snack; in fact I EAT THEM EVERY DAY!!  They fill my craving for salty chips for very few calories.  One small bag does it for me.  I like the original, but the other flavors are also good!  Without these, I may have had to eat regular chips and had difficulty keeping my weight off.  Popchips are a dieter's dream!

review/summary: YUMMY, YUMMY a little bit of love for your Tummy
review/text: Hey!!  these things taste good. At first I thought they would be like Pringles," which I don't care for " but they are not. Hard to explain since I don't know what to compare them too. I guess I would call them light and fluffy and yet nice and crisp with a great natural flavor.<br /><br /> These have taken some of the guilt out of eating this type of snack for me. I love potato chips but they are loaded with lots of unhealthy things. I'm not saying these are healthy, just a lot less unhealthy than chips.<br /><br /> For starters these are all natural with very little fat and fairly low in carbs for a food of this type. My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.<br /><br /> Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide.

review/text: Popchips are no ordinary chips. What's in them is as good as what's not in them.<br />No preservatives. No artificial flavors. No saturated fat. No gluten ingredients.<br />Popchips are thicker than ordinary chips. They're crunchy ,zesty, tasty, and not overly salty. I like that there's no greasy residue on my hands after eating some.<br /><br />The chips are uniform in size, strong enough to dip, and small enough to make double dipping unnecessary.<br />After sampling these for the first time, I'm looking forward to enjoying these great tasting and satisfying chips again.

review/summary: So much better than "baked" chips
review/text: About 3 months ago I stayed at a hotel in Los Angeles and these chips were in the room, offered comp to hotel guests. I am not sure I would've tried them otherwise, but I am glad I did and now I'm addicted. I am a thin person so it's all about the taste for me, calories are not an issue. I've never really liked the taste of greasy chips, but baked chips seemed so bland. These chips are the best  and you should give them a try. They are tasty and not greasy. My personal favorite is the original potato flavor, but they are all pretty good.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I don't normally review food products but these were so good I wanted to share.

review/text: I tried these chips looking for a healthy snack and they are quite tasty.  The packing/shipping however leaves a lot to be desired.  My box came completely smashed up and all the bags are crushed, with only about 1/4 of the chips in each bag actually intact. The rest are crumbs and dust.  VERY disappointed in the packaging.  There should be a box within a box and some type of protection..ie packing peanuts.

review/summary: The Barbecue are my favorite chips!!!
review/text: PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down. The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy. The calories and fat are very low. No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip. You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem. But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case and get to save money to boot.  These chips are not like regular chips - the texture is different, I assume from the "popping," but once you taste them, you will become addicted, too! One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!

Because if you buy in bulk you save. Having to buy a box of 24... all that extra packaging is going to cost you.

And let me tell you, if you do that at least they are healthier than the other options. I couldn't find my favorite flavor in my area though. I found the other flavors (sour cream & onion, cheddar, barbeque & original), but not my favorite. So I went this route & couldn't be happier. Yum! But these are MY chips...get your own. :-)

review/text: Okay, I'm a popchip addict, the first step is admitting there's a problem. I first tried them when they were served to me instead of chips in a deli in NYC. I kept the bag and found them on Amazon and started buying them by the case. Not as salty as regular chips, they also have considerably less grease, more of a tasty rice cake experience than a greasy Lay's chip. I have bought cases of the single-serve bags, and end up giving them to friends and coworkers, who turn around and order them for themselves. Yeah, they are good.

I have replaced the regular potato chips,"even the baked ones" with these. I think they're better. Going to try the sea salted vinegar ones as well as the plains. Will report following.
