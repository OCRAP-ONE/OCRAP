review/summary: A little thin and pasty
review/text: I've tried a number of different kinds of Australian licorice and for me these really came up short. The licorice taste is rather thin and weak, and the texture is very pasty. There is a nice lingering aftertaste, but this was about the only positive.<br /><br />It is possible that there is a lot a variability among batches, but I tried several bags and each was similar

review/summary: YUCK!
review/text: I saw that these cookies were made by Nabisco, so I figured they would be nice to keep on hand as a snack. Figured they would be similar to a Chips Ahoy cookie, also made by Nabisco.  I loved the fact that these are single serve packs, keeping them fresh, and couldn't wait for them to arrive. I was excited when then arrived...that is until I actually tried them.  AWFUL is the only word I know to describe them. These have absolutely no flavor, few chips, and the chips that they do have don't even taste like a chocolate chip...maybe the really cheap imitation chocolate chips you sometimes see at the dollar type stores. If I was to put flour in a bowl, add a little sugar, and a few imitation chocolate bits, it would probably taste something similar to these cookies. I usually don't mind the bargain cookies in the stores, but these Nabisco cookies are so tasteless and bad that I did not even finish the first cookie out of the single serving pack. Cancelled my subscription and will be throwing the rest away...not even worth donating to someplace. My advice, save yourself a few dollars and do not buy these.  I could not be more disappointed in Nabisco for making such a poor quality, tasteless cookie.

review/summary: Surprised and Disappointed
review/text: I ordered these cookies, thinking that they couldn't have too high of a calorie count(at the time I didn't see the calorie link on this page)and thought they would make a nice convenient snack.  The price seemed to be good.  I received them yesterday, tried them and still didn't see a calorie count.  They were pretty good, and I figured they would be a nice addition to my healthy eating plan.  Today I look on here again and see a confusing calorie count that makes it sound like each of the two very small cookies has 115 or so calories!  Considering their size, that's pretty disappointing.  These may get donated to a friend or relative because I can think of many more things that are much more satisfying for 232 calories.  These are good and convenient if you aren't counting calories, but if you are, you might consider one of the other great offerings here on Amazon.

review/summary: If you're into crunchy, and no salt, these are for you!
review/text: I've recently been placed on a very, very restrictive low-salt, low protein diet and rice is been my savior.  I love crunchy things, so I've tried both the Unsalted Plain and the Veggie Low Salt crackers (from the same manufacturer) and found I like these Unsalted ones best. I've reordered the 12 pack three times now! I've doctored up my Tofutti (soy-based cream cheese) with jams and spices and used these crackers for breakfast, snacks, etc.  A serving is 9 crackers and they're little bit bigger than a U. S. silver dollar.  If you're looking for a lot of flavor in your crackers, this might not be the one for you--but to me it's just a crunchy delivery system!

review/summary: Brown Rice Snaps
review/text: Amazon tells me that Unsalted Sesame Brown Rice Snaps are no longer available, so I'm trying Brown Rice Snaps, Unsalted Plain with Organic Brown Rice.  Unsalted and gluten free are requirements and having them made with organic brown rice is definitely a plus, but I miss the sesame seed addition from the originals.  They are not shipping well, however, as a lot of the crackers in the outside packages arrive broken.  As I am not making a presentation with them but just consuming them at home, this isn't a big deal.  If they were intended for a public offering, only part of them would qualify.  They're crunchier than the Sesame crackers, which were quite crunchy enough themselves.  I will continue to order them unless the Sesame Crackers reappear; then I will go back to the sesames.

If they share the equipment, no matter how well cleaned there is a substantial risk of them being contaminated with gluten, and therefore, especially for the most sensitive celiacs/gluten-intolerant people, NOT REALLY GLUTEN-FREE!<br />Gastro-intestinal roulette?(It only takes a small amount of gluten equal to the size of one grain of rice to do damage.)<br />This product and others like it should be labeled "wheat-free" only, not "gluten-free".

review/text: I love these brown rice snaps. They are very hard to find in my local supermarkets(the unsalted kind). The only problem that I had was that 1/2 of the snaps in each package were broken. It's very hard to have crackers and cheese with broken crackers. It's hard to find packages of these snaps in the supermarket with all of the snaps intact. They are very delicate. There has to be a better way of packaging these snaps so that they won't get broken in shipping. But....if you are looking for an unsalted cracker....they are very good!

I noticed in the ingredient list that it's actually made from %80 brown rice flour and %20 WHITE rice flour. I avoid white rice because it is nutritionally void. I've never had a bad reaction from eating brown rice. I ate these rice snaps and experienced pain in my teeth and gums the next day. I don't regularly eat sweet foods, but when I do I get the same type of reaction. I will not buy these "brown rice" snaps again.

review/summary: Poor packaging for normal shipment
review/text: These crackers are high quality, tasty and I thoroughly enjoy them. They stay crunchy and are one of may favorite snacks with cheese or other salsa or dip.<br />It is the packaging that was poor to the level of being nearly incompetent.<br />(The carrier was Federal Express, but this is a packaging not a shipping problem.)<br />The 12 packs were inside a double wall, corrugated display box.  The display box was inside another double wall, corrugated box.  The boxes are undamaged. However, the interior display box was protected/cushioned from the outside shipping box by only three wads of kraft paper.  That quality of cushioning was absolutely inadequate for protecting the fragile items: crackers. One third of the crackers are in very small pieces, not crushed but severely damaged, reduced to rice crispy size.  Items like this need "popcorn" or "worms" or small foam pieces as packing material to absorb the shock of normal shipping.<br />Perhaps eliminating the display box and packing the cracker containers directly in popcorn-type material would be even more effective.<br />I've learned my lesson. I'll be very wary of ordering anything through Amazon with this potential for damage.

The milk chocolate/hazelnut and the milk chocolate truffles are some of the BEST chocolates I've eaten in my lifetime and I will be forever grateful that they exist.<br /><br />However, as I'm no spring chicken, the extra calories aren't doing me any favors so I decided to "go healthy" by having little bits of dark chocolate at a time instead of gobbling down an entire milk choc/hazelnut bar.<br /><br />This DC/Black Currant bar is delicious.  It's smooth, not bitter and it has bits of sweet currants and crunchy almonds for texture.  The fruit taste is obvious, but not overwhelming, and I am happy with a 1 square after supper to satisfy my sweet tooth.<br /><br />Definitely recommend!

review/summary: Too much RED DYE!!
review/text: I didn't wanted to buy anything that was made with rawhide but a friend gave my pup a Dingo and he loved it. So I forced myself and brought my first bag of Dingo Dental Bones a month ago. Stitch loved it! I loved it too because he actually spent a good 45 minutes~2 hours on a Dingo Dental Bone. I didn't really like the red dye in the chicken meat but it wasn't overwhelming. If you actually crack a piece of the chicken off you can still see some non-dyed chicken.<br /><br />So I ordered a second bag of Dingo, just the original red package. The red dye was so strong that the whole piece of chicken was blood red and it even DYED the rawhide pinkish red!! It's kind of ridiculous to dye something the dog can smell! It's not necessary as long it tastes delicious.<br /><br />Anyhow I am on the search for something else, hopefully a better alternative other than Dingos.<br /><br />At least it wasn't made in China.

review/text: I've stopped buying Dingo products when I noticed that they were being made in China.  I was on their website, and they answered one of the posters that was concerned about it, essentially stating that they test the products rigorously and go through strict quality control.  That's a bunch of CRAP !! They started making them in China to SAVE MONEY, they are not about to SPEND those savings on testing and quality control. What they do is GAMBLE that the products will be okay, and if they aren't they just RECALL them, write off the loss, and it's just too bad for the poor little pets that end up with life threatening illnesses.  Our government doesn't do anything about it, because our government is OWNED by Corporations, far be it for them to interfere with the Almighty Multi-National Corporations.<br />  I'm not taking ANY chances with MY dogs, I care for them way too much, to buy something that was processed in some factory in China that processes everything under the sun, from car batteries, to baby food. If there's some cross-contamination going on, it probably won't be discovered until it's already too late for SOME pets.

review/text: dogs love them but cheaper at Walgreens, 24 pack is $10. I microwave them in water for 1 minute on high and let them soak for 10 minutes to soften them. The dogs like them better that way.

review/summary: Best Dog Bones Around
review/text: I have 2 dogs and they both love them.  My mastiff can eat anything, but my beagle has a very sensative stomach.  We tried several other types of rawhide, but they all made her sick.  She tried this and loved it and it didn't make her sick.  Glad I could find a rawhide they both can eat.

review/text: My dogs loves these.  They get one first thing after coming inside after there morning walk.  Their a quick reward, takes them about 10 minutes to chew and eat.  They seem to be healthy for them, I notice no negative change in their waste since giving them these bones a few months ago.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these.  Try out a bag, the odds are in your favor their going to love them.

review/summary: my yorkie loves them!!!
review/text: Its hard to find treats that my yorkie really loves, he goes completly crazy with Greenies but he can eat one in like 5 minutes so I feel like they are not worth it. I saw these and target and I decided to give them a tried... He smelled them and in like 10 min he was already chewing on one... He eats one in like 15 minutes and Im trying to give him one a day, during a week his teeth look so much better and his gums are not red anymore... so I think I prefer these treats over Greenies.

review/summary: My puppy tires of these...and they can be VERY dangerous!
review/text: My puppy loves to chew, so I got these.  She likes them until the meat entwined in them is gone, then she goes to something else.  Plus they can be VERY dangerous.  I saw her chewing on something one day and went to look.  She had found one of these she'd left where I didn't see it and had chewed it to where the end was gooey and mushy.  I've read that if they swallow this part, it can get caught in their intestines and block them OR in their throat and choke them.  I threw them away after reading that and reading sad stories of others who had to take their dog to the vet, expensive surgeries and such.  I'll never buy them or anything like them again.  I don't get anything for her that is rawhide, can splinter, etc.  The best thing I've found for her to chew on that is edible and safe is called "Beefeaters Sweet Potato Snacks For Dogs".  Do a search here on amazon.com or on Google and you can find them from $8.99 and up, but they're worth it to have something safe for your dog to chew on.  They are all natural, satisfies her need to chew, is full of vitamins and most importantly, SAFE for her.  They come in a huge bag, so for my little 6 pounder, they last a long time.  Sometimes I even cut one in half and give it to her.  The slices are pretty big, so they'd be very good for big dogs too.  Stay clear of ANYTHING rawhide or like that if you love your four-legged baby.

review/summary: Careful!  Dogs can CHOKE and DIE on these!
review/text: My 5 month old french bulldog puppy almost died on the first bone tonight.  He chewed it down and attempted to swallow a piece that was too big to go down his throat.  When he began gagging and throwing up I had to stick my hand down his throat to push the lodged bone into his stomach.  VERY scary and upset me greatly.  I do NOT recommend these bones.  There is even a choking warning on the back in small writing.  Keep your pet safe and purchase MUCH BIGGER bones for them, and take away anything too small so they cannot choke or get hurt.

review/summary: Missy's "Must Have"!!
review/text: When I got my dachshund from the Humane Society, she was overweight and had bad tartar on her teeth.  The vet said she'd need to be seen in a few weeks to have the tartar removed.  Instead, she was given a Dingo Bone every evening, which she chewed up.  Her teeth are nice and clean now.<br /><br />Missy was also placed on a low calorie food and no longer receives "people food". She gets her daily Dingo Bone right after her evening meal and she wants it IMMEDIATELY!  Doxies can get quite bouncy when they really want something.<br /><br />I really appreciate the large value package which is not offered in any store, and the price, plus the ease and fast shipping when I purchase through Amazon.

review/summary: Good value mini rawhide bones - 40 lb Labrador pup enjoys them
review/text: After finishing a whole pack of 21 bones, our Labrador pup loved these bones with meat in the middle. A tasty treat indeed. The bones are wrapped properly and it keeps  both our puppy and us satisfied.<br /><br />In response to some glaring negative reviews, just be aware that anything your dog eats is a hazard. If those aforementioned bad experiences were true, I'm truly sorry. Take care of your dogs the best you can. Regardless, the rawhide is still a potential risk. However, the reviews referring to the bad quality due to the Chinese production is completely fraudulent. Just because it's made in China does NOT mean the product is made poorly.  It is simply a unsupported attack towards this company. I've also seen the almost exact "Anti-Chinese" review for Pork chomps rawhide bones.<br /><br />Some other thoughts:<br />* The meat in the middle can be a little jagged sharp sometimes. Just check it before feeding your dog.<br />* Great value for the 21 pack<br />* Our Labrador pup loves them<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with these rawhide bones with meat in the middle. If our puppy could say it, she would agree with me too.

They are fairly small so if your dog is any larger than 15lbs you will probably want to get the next size up.  Even our 12lb dog could handle something bigger but we buy one size out of convenience.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend these but I suggest that you watch the price, as it seems to fluctuate a lot.  I bought two bags for the price that one is currently listed for!

review/text: My Jack Russells love these little bones.  They will chew on them until their gone rather than hide them or bury them for later.  I do have trouble with one dog eating them much faster than the other so then they get in a game of steal the bone, but hey, that just wears them out faster.  When I bought this, it was $12.99 which wasn't much of a "value" compared to the price at Kroger.  But I think they are now $9.99 which is like getting one 7-pack for free.

review/summary: Our dogs go crazy for these things!
review/text: We have two dogs, both medium-sized, Beagle mixes that we got from rescue places.  These Dingo Mini Bones are unquestionably their all-time favorite treats.  The "mini" size is really perfect because it makes it much more economical to give it to them more often.

review/summary: DANGEROUS BONES!!!!
review/text: DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one. They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart.

review/text: I just lost my dog of 14 years to a Dingo bone. She choked to death last night. I rushed her to a emergency vet clinic but it was too late. She was a Shih Tzu so beware if you have a small dog and you give them these. She ate Dingo bones as a treat all of her life and never had a problem. I have another dog and just threw out 4 bags of these. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY THESE for my dog.

review/summary: My dog nearly died last night
review/text: I was skeptical to give my yorkie rawhides but my vet said it would be okay.  These were the only treats that would keep him entertained since he doesn't care much for toys and they were very easy to find.  Unfortunately my dog seemed to swallow a large piece of the mini dingo rawhides yesterday.  At 2 am I heard my dog let out a loud howl that I have never heard before, I went to check on him and found him gagging and obviously trying to throw something up.  Right as I was about to take him to the animal hospital he threw up the rawhide and he's all better now.  I'm NEVER giving him a rawhide treat, they swell in the dog's stomach and can kill them.  I rather not take that risk with my dog.

review/summary: Pure Cotton Candy
review/text: I really love cotton candy. It brings me right back to my childhood: days spent running around carnivals all summer, wishing I was one of the girls in the sparkly dresses riding on elephants. Of course I'd love to have it all the time now, but it's really not that great for you. I mean, it's literally pure sugar! And food dye. So, I just had to get some cotton candy matcha! The idea of cotton candy that is actually good for you, how can I turn that down?<br /><br />The taste of this is SO good. I can't believe it tastes so much like cotton candy! If you told me my glass had melted cotton candy in it with some matcha, I'd believe you because it is that good. AND with no sugar at all! Just water and matcha. And the taste lingers, my mouth was all cotton candy-y for a good half hour after I finished. This is just... it's so good. If you like cotton candy you owe it to yourself to try this one out right now. Seriously!

review/summary: Cotton Candy - YUM!
review/text: Cotton Candy Match!  To say I'm excited is an understatement!  I loved Cotton Candy as a kid and still at the age of thirty-seven will buy cotton candy when I see it.  My hubby humors my childlike excitement.<br />My first encounter with this matcha was heaven!  I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep in the yummy goodness.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.<br />I unpacked my matcha bowl that I specifically as for at Christmas time so that I could properly prepare matcha.  Then came the chasen from its tight plastic case.  Since this was its first use I warmed it up a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  I think part of what I love about matcha is the preparation that feels very ceremonial.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha and water!<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with 1 perfect teaspoon of matcha. Of course in my preparation I was so excited and almost forgot to sift it first..disaster avoided!  Once that was properly mixed I added a teeny bit of sugar (this is cotton candy of course) and 6 oz of water.  After I properly exhausted any strength from my whipping right hand I was ready.<br />The smell of this matcha is not as strong once mixed with water.  The taste is there though!  The quality of this matcha is very tasty.  It doesn't taste too vegetal or clash with the sweetness off the cotton candy.  I think next time I will add just a bit more sugar as I didn't want to go overboard the first time and not really get  the original taste of the matcha.<br />My plan for the rest of Cotton Candy is to mix it first as a latte.  Then, try adding to my health food drink which is a vanilla base.  So I'll be back to let you know how that works out!<br />To get your own tasty Cotton Candy Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]<br />In closing - YUM!!!!

review/summary: Tastes like it should be served at the carnival!
review/text: We all love cotton candy, right?  I mean, really ... who doesn't love the stuff?  There is nothing that is more evocative of a carnival or fair than cotton candy, and that's where the best cotton candy is found.  But THIS Cotton Candy Matcha tastes like it should be served right alongside the corn dogs and popcorn at the carnival!<br /><br />It really tastes like Cotton Candy & Matcha!  The matcha tastes like I'd expect it to:  bittersweet (although with the cotton candy flavor, the sweetness is really enhanced even more than usual) with vegetative tones, and a buttery undertone.  It tastes creamy and has a rich, smooth texture (no chalkiness!)<br /><br />And then the cotton candy ... it tastes, well, like Cotton Candy!  It is sugary sweet and delicious.  All that's missing is that texture:  fluffy, cottony feel on the tongue followed by a light crunch.  But, I'm willing to trade that in for the health benefits of the Matcha!<br /><br />This stuff is AWESOME!  You've gotta try it!

review/text: Its so nice to have these delectable treats in matcha form, thus healthy, and yet feel so satisfied by them! All the pleasure none of the guilt! Although I admit I do mix mine with milk and sometimes use creamer to make a latte but gah its still better than the real stuff!<br />This has just the right amount of sweetness to it yet still allows me to feel as though I am getting that green tea goodness!<br />I can't imagine anyone not loving this tea and it seems any tea that has Cotton Candy in the name has been a favorite of mine but then again this is only the second one I have found and this is the ONLY matcha! I can't even make the entire cup last through this review its THAT good!

review/summary: Just like the fair!
review/text: There was no way in the world I was not picking up this matcha blend. I've had some great tasting cotton candy teas in the past so I knew it could be done! Also, I have this vast collection of cotton candy flavoured drink recipes to be made - and remade - matcha style! Pinterest can be very inspiring! The one that is most intriguing in a cotton candy lemonade, where you just pour sweet lemonade over a glass full of cotton candy. Has anyone ever tried matcha lemonade? That is pretty much what this matcha was MADE for, and I wish I had some friends to come have a summer party so I could make some and not get heartburn from drinking the whole pitcher. So, you're invited! Just let me know when you're coming so I can clean!<br /><br />Yay! This Cotton Candy matcha takes me to my happy place! Fun times at the fair under a hot blue sky - that is what cotton candy is to me. I got the basic matcha with the delicate flavouring and it is just perfect! So much yummy cotton candy flavour - and it really blows my mind, because it doesn't just taste generally sweet and sugary - it actually tastes like spun sugar! Bright pink and blue spun sugar that just melts on your tongue.<br /><br />I enjoyed this flavour of matcha hot - but it also made a very refreshing and energizing iced tea. Since Cotton Candy is such a summer flavour, I was happy to have it by my side on a sweltering hot day. It is especially good sprinkled on some real vanilla icecream. Have you ever tried cotton candy ice cream? It's usually made with a pretty cheap ice cream brand, and although it's usually delicious anyways, it doesn't even hold a candle to a high quality ice cream sprinkled with this wonderfully flavoured cotton candy matcha. A cold, sweet treat on a hot day!

review/summary: Cotton Candy
review/text: Guh, cotton candy. This was the flavor I most looked forward to, and it's the one I ripped into and gleefully made a cup as soon as the package arrived. So much for my nap, I have matcha to drink! I didn't even read the description on the site, it just instantly wound up in my cart. Cotton candy is childhood to me, as well as a good number of college years spent drinking cotton candy cosmos. I can hear my mother in my head right now. "No, you can't get cotton candy, if we're going to pay $5 for a snack, it's going to be something more than just spun sugar!" But rarely she would cave and oh man. Oooooh man. I remember at one company picnic, they had a cotton candy machine, and you could have all the cotton candy you wanted. They even showed you how to make it! It was amazing. It was the ultimate snack of my childhood. Fast forward a few years to the summer between my first and second year of college. I had an apartment with three other girls, two of whom I didn't know, and I was working at Beech Bend Park. Now, if you know where that is, you either a) went to Western Kentucky University or b) are a biker, because it's adjacent to the Beech Bend racetrack and the Beech Bend Campground, where Harley days are held every year. Usually, I got stuck working the teacups (ironic, huh?), but every once in a while, I got to work food services and I got to make the cotton candy. Oh my goodness. Heaven. Hot work, but heaven. A year or two later I went to O'Charley's with a friend and spotted the Cotton Candy Cosmo on the menu. Unable to resist anything cotton candy, I had to try out. Out came a martini glass overflowing with fresh cotton candy. A little shaker contained vodka and when your poured the vodka over the cotton candy, it melted and mixed in so beautifully that you forgot you were drinking way too much alcohol.<br /><br />Now it's my go-to snack when the wife takes me to the movies. It's $3 and it makes my inner kid go bouncing all over the place. This tea does the same thing. It's...it's amazing how much it really does taste like cotton candy, especially when cold. The cooler my cup got, the more it tasted like those little fluffy clouds of heaven. You can still taste the matcha, and it has an odd creaminess to it, but it's just...wow. Wow. It all blends together and it even has that burnt sugar bit at the end of the sip. I'm going to take a cup of this to the Zoo next Tuesday, ride the carousel, and just go back in time to the carnivals and theme parks of my youth.

review/summary: Fits all my criteria for granola
review/text: The are absolutely delicious, I love every one of their flavors including this one. The flavor is intense and better than a blueberry muffin. My whole family loves it. I ordered directly from annie's site after finding out Kashi uses gmo soy in their granola bars.<br /><br />My criteria for granola needs to be 6 g sugar or less per bar, non-gmo and wholesome ingredients, and affordable. Annie's was the only one on the market to deliver all three (and I really scoured the internet and health food stores comparing many, many brands - which either had too much sugar, were not gmo free, or were healthy but ridiculously expensive). I am thrilled that they taste so good too, beside meeting my needs.<br /><br />The boxes I received were chewy, fresh, and have a real dense quality about them. I have never been a fan of berry granola bars because they taste the same as the regular bars or are very weakly flavored. These are divine - like a berry muffin, they won me over to the berry flavor world with these.<br /><br />Perfect for a snack - I often have it with fruit and cheese - I have never found any brand granola bar on it's own to suffice anyhow. In comparison kashi's were larger, drier and felt somewhat like eating flavored cardboard at times in comparison to these. FYI the reviews that state these are small - yes they are skinny, but they are dense, and only 20 calories less than most other brands, which is not much. This is my first time ordering from amazon subscribe and save so we'll see if the quality is consistent - hope so!<br /><br />*** Update:<br /><br />I am sorry to say that there is indeed a quality control issue with these. I will be making my next purchase directly from annie's (like I did my first time), which I hate to do because I prefer the subscribe and save program. The bars are noticeably less fresh, and some bars aren't even complete! I wonder, does this company pinch pennies a little too much, or have quality control problems? I hate to think they send their '2nd rate' boxes over to amazon. Really too bad.

review/text: These are the worst granola bars I have ever had in my life. I gave one to my two year old today without trying it myself and she wouldn't eat it. She usually loves granola bars. I went to eat the rest of it and couldn't even bite into it! I had to gnaw it to get some off. And when I did it tasted like plain oatmeal held together with wax. It was disgusting.

review/text: The box for these says 'chewy yet crispy'.  However, I found the majority of the several box pack that I bought to be very crunchy, not chewy at all.  There were a few that I would consider to be chewy, but not many.  The expiration date was several months away, so I would expect them all to be chewy (yet crispy).  Not sure what was up with these, but I was disappointed and won't be ordering them again.  If you want chewy granola bars, I suggest something else.

review/summary: Excellent Tea.
review/text: I grew up drinking authentic Moroccan Tea in Morocco. I recomment Davidson's Moroccan Mint Green Tea with full confidence that you will enjoy it too. The Quality Quantity and Price were all excellent. The delivery time and condition were impressive. I'm new to Amazon Online and to Davidson's products, but I will be a customer for a very long time now.<br /><br />Traditionally Moroccan Tea is made the following way:<br />1st Boil the Water untill bubbles form a ring on surface.<br />2nd Add Tea Leaves and Sugar (about 1tsp of leaves to 24oz of water)<br />3rd Boil a second time on low and monitor to prevent overflow.<br />*** wait about 5min before drinking to allow the process to finish<br />PS. if done correctly, the tea leaves should settle at bottom, so no infuser will be needed.

review/summary: Smells great, tastes amazing.
review/text: This was 12.50?! This is an amazing deal on a great pound of tea. The mint flavor is not overpowering, which I really like. This tea is amazing iced with a little honey and Splenda. I steep it for about a minute, strain it through a mesh strainer, bottle it, and put it in the fridge for a few hours. The remaining tea dust and small leaves that make it through continue to brew the tea while it cools, which gives it a nice, pungent kick.<br /><br />But do note that this is not a true Moroccan Mint tea. Moroccan tea is brewed with a lot of sugar, then fresh mint leaves are added to the brew. The tea most widely used is Gunpowder, and usually green. But this is a fine substitute for when you're not in Morocco at the moment.<br /><br />I drink a lot of green tea, and I needed a cheaper source. Davidson's was the answer. At 12 to 13 bucks a pound, with good quality, it's close to a steal. I have no idea of where the tea was grown,  which is of no issue to me, b/c it tastes great, and it's organic. No Mercury or Lead to worry about.<br /><br />This is a whole pound, so please make sure you can drink that much tea within two months, or else it will lose it's flavor. Since it is shipped in a paper bag, I recommend transfering it to an airtight container as soon as you get it to preserve the flavor. Or better yet, vacuum pack some of it into multiple bags and open one up when you need it.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/text: Strong spearmint leaves well blended with green tea.  At first I felt that mint taste in the brewed tea was not strong enough (even though the mint is highly aromatic when you smell the loose leaf tea), but as I drink it I think that the blend is quite nice.  The mint is not dominant in the brewed tea (less minty than, say, Celestial Seasonings bagged Green Tea Mint), but it is definitely present.  An excellent value.

review/text: Good price, not the greatest quality. Mint tea has a lot of volatile oils and loses them rapidly after harvesting and drying. My package was obviously exposed to the air either before or after packaging to the point that most of the mint is gone. Dissapointed, even cheaper mint bagged tea is packaged in airtight containers to retain it's flavor and essential oils. I hope Davidson's can improve on their quality control and packaging.

I've bought the Boston Tea Moroccan Mint before and it has a nice minty smell.<br /><br />Still, I figured once I brewed it I could surely taste it.  Nope.  This just tasted like regular green tea.  So, it gets two stars for actually being / tasting like green tea but it tasted like a sub-par tea without any mint added.  Nothing special.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Back to Boston Tea for me.

review/summary: My go-to tea
review/text: Once again I'm thrilled with Davidson's! I've ordered three pounds of tea and each one is as delicious as the next. Who would't want a tastier and cheaper alternative to bagged tea?<br /><br />Looks pretty in a glass container, loose. I drink at least 8 cups of tea per day since I discovered Davidson's. Perfect to add some aroma and reduce cravings at my desk job. I wish I could give them more business but their product is inexpensive and lasts forever. I resteep leaves 2-4 times. The photo is misleading, they come in airtight plastic/foil lined paper bags with a resealable zip seal. I keep mine in containers though.<br /><br />I started with the Moroccan Green w/Mint, which is mild in flavor and only slightly minty. It's my go-to tea. It's perfect for me because I'm sensitive to caffeine but need a little boost in the morning, I also have chronic nausea and the mint is helpful with that.  The Earl Grey w/Lavender is bold and leaves a fresh taste in the mouth. The Cranberry Orange herbal is perfect for relaxing or curbing sugar cravings later in the day.<br /><br />Davidson's made me a tea snob. I wish I could get more, but I'll have to wait months or years until I run out!

review/summary: Good tea
review/text: This is pretty good tea for the price. It has a nice mint flavor that's not overpowering.<br /><br />I think the Teavana Morocan Mint Tea has a slightly better taste, but this Davidson's tea tastes nearly as good and is about 1/3 the price, so it's definitely a good deal.<br /><br />I divide it into smaller air-tight storage tins to help preserve the flavor since it takes me months to go through 16 oz of tea.

review/summary: Makes good mint iced tea
review/text: I found this a very economical way to make lots of yummy mint iced tea.<br /><br />I microwave about 8 cups of water (I use an 8-cup Pyrex glass measuring cup) for 15 minutes to bring the temp to about 180 (+/- 20 degrees seems OK). I then add 8 tsp of this tea, let steep for 6 to 8 minutes (longer gives stronger taste, but at 8 mins it's at the edge of getting bitter too). While still hot I add 4 TBL of honey.<br /><br />The package is lined with plastic and has a "zip-loc" type seal at the top. Seems to work fine as every time I open the package I'm hit with the aroma of mint.

review/summary: An amazing value for the price!
review/text: I have been an avid tea-drinker since childhood, and my boss recently got me hooked on loose-leaf tea.  I was going broke, though, buying it from our local tea store, so I decided to see what kind of deal I could find online.  I have to admit I was skeptical of the Davidson's tea at first, because of the price, but figured it was worth a shot, given that I wouldn't be losing much if it turned out not to be good.  I'm so glad I tried it!  The quality is definitely on par with teas I have paid many times this much for, and the packaging helps to keep it fresh for quite some time.  I've been recommending this to all my tea-drinking friends, and will be purchasing a lot more Davidson's teas, both for myself and as gifts, in the future.

review/summary: Okay for the price
review/text: This is a lot of tea for a pretty good price.  But believe the other reviews.  This is a  green tea with a barely noticeable hint of mint.  Also it seams there is a lot more tea dust than leaves.  Even with a fine mesh sieve many tiny tea leaves end up in the cup.

review/summary: Bitter and Flavorless
review/text: I am a long time fan of Moroccan mint teas and after reading the mixed reviews for this tea I decided to give it a try as $14 a pound would have been a steal.  Unfortunately the batch I received was completely undrinkable.  After following the recommended steep time and temperature the tea was overwhelmingly bitter and had almost no detectable mint flavor. I tried shorter and longer steep times with the same results every time.<br /><br />It is most likely that the batch I received was old because the mint oil in this kind of tea has a short shelf life, but with the no return policy of this seller don't waste your money.

review/summary: Disapointed
review/text: The first three or four brewings out of this bag were excellent. The flavor was full and very pleasing. Unfortunately despite my best efforts to seal and store this tea properly it lost its spearmint potency very very quickly and it eventually became completely undrinkable. I've bought other Davidsons bulk bags before though and enjoyed them all for a very long time, so I think the problem with this tea is not so much a quality issue (as I said, the first couple brewings were great) but rather it has to do with the shelf life of the spearmint.
