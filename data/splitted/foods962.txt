review/summary: Good idea - Stale Candy
review/text: I was looking for that extra something as a joint gift to my grandparents. I got them individual gifts but it did not seem enough so I got this for them as well. When they opened it they seemed excited about the gift and looking forward to seeing the contents. I then asked them later how they liked it and my grandmother said it was no good and the candy was stale. Well that was embarassing. I love buying Christmas presents and finding unique and fun things for my loved ones. I dont get to do a lot for my family normally like most people on a tight budget. I feel let down by the company and sad that the point of the gift wasn't able to be achieved. I would not buy this again and would sadly not be able to recommend it. I think it is a neat idea but the quality of the candy was no good.

review/summary: Not a lot
review/text: I ordered this with another retro package of Candy. The other box had 3x more in it. It was packaged much nicer and really made a great gift. When I bought the items both were on sale and the other item was actually a dollar less and worth 10x as much! Its a skimpy box and I was disappointed with my purchase. This is the link for the other item that was so much better!<br />[...]

review/summary: Best Salmon in a pouch I have tasted
review/text: I am moving away from eating meat every day to eating fish and have been trying different varieties of salmon. I have tried salmon burgers, salmon in a can like tuna fish, and came across this version at my local grocery store. I bought ten packs and am glad I did. You can open the pouch into a small frying pan and in a few minutes the salmon is cooked on both sides. I just add a small salad or veggies (steamed broccoli is my favorite), and I pour the lemon/dill water and the salmon filet onto my plate and dig in. There are other salmon pouches by Bumblebee that cost less that you can add dill and lemon to yourself. But if you are tired when you get home from work and want something fast, this is an ideal meal. My grocery store and its delivery service no longer carry these pouches, so I will be ordering from Amazon from now on.

review/summary: Vegans Beware: Has Sugar
review/text: This item is listed as vegan, but the list of ingredients is not visible in the image, and the ingredients is not listed on Amazon. I contacted the company to send me the information on a few sauces. They have sugar in them, though they are labelled vegan. The company rep wrote that, "All of the sauces you are interested are vegan, it contains no dairy product, meat or seafood. However, all cooking sauces contain sugar." This is obviously a contradiction to many, if not most vegans.<br /><br />I write this as an FYI to those wanting to find a vegan sauce. My daughter just turned vegan and needs an stir fry sauce without sugar or with organic sugar or other sweetener, so I felt I was almost tricked into buying this, but she would have been upset.<br /><br />I gave it only one star because of this misrepresentation.

review/summary: If you like peanuts, you're going to love this
review/text: The product looks exactly like the image shown - no marking on the package at all.  So, if you'd like to know the nutritional content of the package, it's not available.<br /><br />The mix contains 30% - 40% peanuts.  So, if you like peanuts, you're going to be very happy. I don't mind peanuts, but I was looking for an Asian mix and the high peanut content is not what I was looking for.  Perhaps half the content is Asian savories, and the balance is almonds.  The wasabi peas are very lightly flavored and have no discernible flavor.<br /><br />On the whole, I'm mostly disappointed, but not enough to return the order.  As a result, I have 6 lbs of marginally palatable snacks.  :(

In fact, I made some black bean chocolate cookies that are a big rave and have only 1 Weight Watcher point each.  Just search for Black Bean chocolate cookies and substitute the two sugars mentioned above for the bad kind.  We are also gluten free here, so I used coconut flour and cocoa powder for part of the flours - very high protein and fiber.  Good luck everyone and enjoy!

I see that the packaging says "fleur de sel" but do not speak French, so that didn't mean a thing to me. I realize that if I had carefully read the entire ad and not only the "Product Features", I would have seen that the "Important Information" and "Product Description" list salt as an ingredient.<br /><br />This is a great product; just be aware that "fleur de sel" means salt!

review/summary: The Best Honey Powder
review/text: Unlike other so-called honey powders, this one is 100% granulated honey with no fillers. Because it is granulated instead of powdered it does not lump. It is easily poured, measured, and spooned. It dissolves quickly and completely. We like it in tea and on cereal. We haven't tried it in baking yet, but intend to. Organic is an added bonus.<br /><br />The package is plastic/foil with a zipper closure so it stays dry. For me, it's worth the premium price.

Within three days from placing my order I was substituting the powdered honey for sugar. Excellent in hot drinks, instantly soluable. Great sprinkled on homemade breads. Sweetens that second bite of tart fruits. Stores in its own convenient re-sealable packaging. Pure, no discernable foriegn particles, even after disolving in clear liquids. My wife has made claim to her own package. We love honey and delight in nature's sweetener. Do not order just a single package, you'll wish you'd had more.  The shipping service was superior.

review/summary: Perfect accompaniment to Japanese Curry Rice
review/text: If you love curry rice dishes and make them at home, then this pickle is a must. Traditionally served as a side dish for curry in Japan, fukujin zuke has a salty sweet flavor from sweetened soy sauce. It's mild taste and crunchy textures goes well with Japanese curry spices.<br /><br />I wish the price were a bit cheaper but for such a rare treat, it's worth it. Highly recommend!<br /><br />You can find Japanese curry sauces in the Asian or International food aisles on the west coast and NW region in the US. Or buy them here on Amazon for a reasonable price. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ITQAU">S&B - Golden Curry Sauce Mix - Medium Hot (Large) 8.4 Oz.</a>

review/summary: Delicious and healthy
review/text: I love finding new healthy snacks that I can keep stashed in places (like my desk at work and study area at home). I don't see the stats listed here anywhere, so here they are in case you're looking for them like I was:<br />Serving Size 1 bar: 246 calories, 14g total fat, 12g sat fat, 0 trans fat, 32mg sodium, 33g carbs, 3.8g fiber, 29g sugar, 1.4g protein.<br /><br />What I love:<br />High fiber, delicious flaky coconut and a few crunchy almonds, and very low sodium. These are absolutely delicious if you like coconut. The fat content seems a little high (as does the sugar) but it is a natural occurring fat and not bad for you like other grease and oils (the same with the sugar). Only THREE INGREDIENTS. I can't stress enough how great it is to flip over the bar and see that coconut, rice syrup and almond are the only ingredients listed. They are also fairly inexpensive, so I don't mind buying them to keep around, most flavors come out to less than $1 per bar.<br /><br />What I don't love:<br />The carbs being a little high, I would only eat these earlier in the day. The protein being so low means I have to have it with something else that is high protein so that I stay full. However, these would go fantastic with some vanilla soy or low-fat cows milk to help that out. Neither of these things are enough for me to take a star away or not order again.<br /><br />If you want more product reviews and food tips, like me on facebook (facebook .com/ DontEatDirt)

review/text: I love some of the other Oskri bars, and when I found this one, I was thinking coconut with clusters of crunchy almonds. Shades of Almond Joy, which I can't have because of the sugar, etc., but these are a disappointment. They're big, and that's usually a plus, but I'm tired of it about midway through a bar. There may be 2 or 3 almonds throughout the bar, but they're soft, so you have to see one to know you've eaten an almond. The coconut and level of sweetness are good, but it simply gets boring after a bite or two. So, I've got a whole box of 'em to eat. Waste not, want not. I'll go back to the other Oskri bars, like the Almonds and Cranberry fiber bar.

I think the matcha itself is really the star of the show, the grassy green tea flavor goes so well with fruit flavors, and pear is no exception! It reminds me of summer, warm days and cold fresh fruit and cut grass. A good, basic flavor, that will be great for blending with other types of matcha.

review/summary: My childhood's wine gum
review/text: These are the true wine gums from my childhood. The green one should be lime flavoured which is where these differ from Gustav's version where the green are apple I believe, not 100% except that they are not lime. These are also more "tender" than the Gustav's wine gums. Shipping was fast given that they were shipped from the UK. It took a week from when I ordered the item from the UK until I received it. Price was good as well compared to the average price here on Amazon when it comes to Maynard's wine gums.

review/summary: Possibly my Favorite K-Cup
review/text: I recently purchased Tully's Full City Roast, as well as Tully's House Blend.  They are both excellent, but personally, I prefer the House Blend by a small margin.  I like several of the extra bold k-cups, especially Gloria Jean's Black Gold, Timothy's Rainforest Espresso and Midnight Magic, and Coffee People Donut Shop.  But I find the Tully's House Blend to have a great mix of being rich and flavorful, but still very drinkable anytime.  It may be my favorite k-cup right now, and I will definitely keep a stock of it around our house.

review/summary: I'm a Tully's Fan! The House Blend Is Becoming One Of My Favorites.
review/text: If we had a 'I'm A Fan' button to push, I would definitely be a fan of Tully's K-cups.<br /><br />Usually I drink lots of Tully's French and/or Kona, and Italian is a new favorite that I know I'll be drinking now that I've tried it.<br /><br />When I think of Tully's Coffee House Blend, I think of going into a restaurant and smelling that wonderful aroma of freshly-made coffee. It tastes delicious!<br /><br />At first I didn't think of it as one of my all-time favorites, because it's just an excellent cup of coffee. Good flavor and aroma, not too dark, not too strong, not too bitter, just delicious. I just came back to edit this review and say that it is becoming one of my all-time favorites, just another great option from Tully's.<br /><br />I used to say that I like to keep it around to drink after I've burned out my taste buds on stronger blends and want to calm my taste buds down a little. Now I've found that I enjoy it pretty much any time.<br /><br />One thing I would say about Coffee House Blend is that it will probably please more people in a household or guests visiting than my all-time favorites, which are way too strong for many people. This is a good choice to please more people. It should please just about everyone!<br /><br />EDITED once more. I came back later to say that with all of my other K-Cup options available to me, I keep reaching for the Tully's House Blend. I don't know if it's just a mood I'm in right now or what, but the others just seem like they are trying too hard. Whatever the reason, I'm enjoying House Blend.<br /><br />EDITED still once more to say now my favorites are House and Italian, both Tully's. It's the best!

review/summary: Bold But Not Extra Bold.  Smooth, Flavorful & Not Bitter..
review/text: Tully's House Blend falls squarely into the Bold category, but it is definitely not an Extra Bold coffee.  It is smooth, flavorful and does not have a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />**** For those medium blend coffee drinkers, this blend may be too strong.  For those that like a jolt in the morning, this coffee may not be bold enough. ****<br /><br />This blend, taste-wise, is not quite as full-bodied as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M62D5S">Tully's Italian Roast, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> yet it is bolder than the Kona blends, which are no longer available.  I also find that it has a just a little more kick than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GVA4">Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>, which is one of my favorite blends to-date.

review/summary: Great coffee, excellent price
review/text: I've been drinking the Tully's House Blend K-Cup coffee for a few years now. I occasionally buy a different variety just to try it out, but always find myself wanting the Tully's more. I have to admit, I do like the new Starbucks K-cups, but they are almost as expensive as going to a Starbucks and buying coffee there, so I'll stick with my Tully's. I find the blend to be just the right mixture of smooth and bold. I can use a single K-cup twice to fill my 16 oz to-go mug and find that it's still strong enough.

review/summary: Full of Rich Flavor
review/text: I've been drinking bold flavors such as Timothy's Rain Forest Expresso and Coffee People's Wake Up Call but have grown tired of the somewhat chalky taste of both.  I recently tried Tully's Kona Blend and it's good but expensive and not available via the "Subscribe and Save" program.  So I took a chance on their House Blend and like it even better than the Kona Blend!  It's a "Bold"<br />K-cup so contains enough coffee to make the larger size cup without it's being weak and the flavor is nice and rich without being bitter or chalky-tasting.  It's my new favorite K-cup!!!

review/text: I first tasted this at my uncle's house on Christmas morning, after he got a Keurig and hooked it up for everyone's enjoyment.<br /><br />I can say without a doubt, that this is the best coffee I have ever tasted. It's absolutely *perfectly* balanced, without a hint of bitterness. Just smooth as silk, it's the kind of coffee that makes you take a sip, curl up in your chair and sigh in satisfaction at the taste. This coffee is actually prompting me to buy a Keurig of my own now, and this will be the very first blend that will go in it.

review/summary: Simply the best K cup out there
review/text: I have been thru them all and Tully's simply makes the best K cups out there. The house blend is great, breakfast blend as well and the hard to find Kona is in a class by itself. Better than Green Mountain, Timothy's, Gloria Jean and Newman's Own. They simply use better coffee beans and the cups are all very consistent. All of their coffees are "Bold" (even the breakfast blend) but the are never bitter like some other Bold varieties. The superb reviews on this brand are accurate.

review/summary: Solid Gourmet Cup of Coffee
review/text: Its just dark enough for my tastes to be brewed on the 7.25oz setting. It has a dark chocolate and brandy aroma. The house blend has a boldness falling in between a medium brew (gloria jeans hazlenut) and a lighter bold brew (newmans organic). The taste is pleasant and has notes of cocoa and malt, and an aftertaste of walnuts. I would recommend this as a keep around the house brew, but not for something to impress guests.

review/summary: Less expensive alternative to the Kona Blend
review/text: I have long been a fan of the Tully Kona Blend coffee. I was disappointed when my local retailer quit selling Kona products!<br /><br />I actually ordered this house blend by accident, thinking that I was ordering the Kona Blend. I had more than 4 cups of coffee before I noticed on the packaging that it said House Blend instead of Kona Blend. I would not have known that it was not the Kona Blend had I not seen the packaging. One caveat: I make "lattes" by adding an equal amount of steamed milk to my coffee, so the coffee flavor is probably diluted for me.  Someone drinking it straight up may notice a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />My bottom line is that it is much less expensive than the Kona Blend, due to vendor and shipping costs, and it is more than good enough for me.  I've since ordered another box.

review/text: Here in Seattle you can't turn around without bumping into a great coffee kiosk, but there is nothing like being able to enjoy a terrific cup of coffee first thing in the morning while still shlepping around in my slippers at home.  As a new Keurig owner, I taste-tested a variety of brands (since it was so easy to do) but my local favorite, Tully's, came out on top.  If smooth, rich, full-bodied coffee can be called comfort food, Tully's has it nailed.  Happily, Amazon shipments arrive promptly.  Yes, K-cup packs are pricey, but life is short.  Drink good coffee!

review/summary: Tully's Coffee House Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)
review/text: I've always appreciated my Keurig brewer but didn't realize how much until I was away from home, no brewer and NO K-cups! I hadn't anticipated the level of 'separation anxiety' I suddenly experienced. Undaunted, I purchased a package of Tully's freshly ground coffee and returned to a conventional coffee maker.  The result was ok - :} but not really the usual great.  Then came reality.  THE GROUNDs.  What a mess! Not only totally inconvenient to measure, but annoyingly difficult to confine to the basket since they always seem to prefer the counter, the sink, the floor, anywhere but where they're supposed to be.  Then, the challenge of disposal-what a mess. Next,the mixing. TOO weak(like "stump-water" I over-heard,) TOO strong...ugh!!!! It was back to that awful trial and error period  which had been so quickly forgotten.  Oh, and don't even ask about the bottled water.  Fortunately the trip was abbreviated and I was soon re-united with my Keurig brewer and my treasured Tully's K-cups.  Lesson learned.

review/summary: I order more of this than any other coffee. Ordering more today!
review/text: I love Tully's House Blend K-Cups! I have several dozen other flavors and always find myself reaching for Tully's House Blend. It is just right when I wake up in the morning and throughout the day. Strong, bold, but not strong enough to make me so hyper that people run from me! I'm about to order more right now and thought I would stop and make a review while I'm thinking about it.

review/summary: Excellent coffee
review/text: Tully's house blend coffee is a bold coffee that isn't bitter but delivers good coffee flavor.  I use the K-cups for that perfect cup of coffee every time.  I was looking for a replacement for the Kona blend coffee since it has become very difficult to find and the prices have sky rocketed to ridiculousness when you do find it.  This house blend has been a good replacement.

review/text: I was looking for a different type of taste from a coffee, something a little stronger, but it had to go down smooth. This coffee surely filled the bill. I was drinking another brand and it was leaving a nasty taste in my mouth and just didn't seem to go down as smoothly as Tully's. I really recommend you try it if you are looking for a strong but smooth coffee!

review/summary: Taste great, but jam up coffee maker
review/text: As many others have stated, the taste of this coffee is fantastic.  Flavor wise, it is by far my favorite.<br /><br />My concern is that these K-cups keep jamming up my coffee maker.  Every time I make this brand of coffee, I have to use a paper clip the next morning to un-jam the Keurig.  I've noticed that these K-cups have a unique behavior about them.  After making a cup of coffee, I go to eject the empty cup.  The empty cup has a large amount of coffee grains on the top of it.  I have never seen this before in my 4 years of using a Keurig.  I am guessing this behavior is directly affecting the coffee maker by jamming it up.

I received Tully's House Blend Extra Bold "Melange maison" instead.  The carton reads House Blend, but the cups inside have the Melange label.  The plain House Blend is much better.  I'm disappointed.

review/text: Like some of you said, I only got 48 also.  Why do they advertise 50 and then send 48?  It seems minimal to us but 2 times the number of orders adds up for them really fast.  I don't like feeling cheated probably won't order again.  The coffee was strong.  I would compare it to Starbucks.  The order information says they have three different strengths and I didn't see where you can choose the strength so they shipped me Extra Bold.  I usually drink coffee black but with this, I make a 10 oz and 4 oz with one k-cup and then add some cream so I guess that knocks down the per cup price.  Still with feeling cheated, I will look for something better.
