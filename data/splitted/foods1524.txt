review/summary: Major crunch
review/text: These are quite flavorful and can be eaten dry out of the bag, as a supplement to your Cheerios or other type cereal, or all by themselves. If you have tender gums these might be a tad rough on them. But if you like a big crunch this cereal is for you.<br /><br />Excellent flavor, loaded with vitamins and omega 3, and nicely filling.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: "OK" Eaten Alone; Better With Yogurt.
review/text: I'm an enthusiatic cinnamon lover and granola eater, and I really wanted to like these more. There is a distinct cinnamon taste, but this product is too dry to be eaten alone for my taste. I decided to try them in some vanilla yogurt, and liked them much better. The hard dryness allows them to no become overly soggy too quickly. There are some "clusters" but the contents of the package reminded more of loose grain given to horses. So, they just get an "OK" from me.

review/summary: Pleasant and lightly sweet flavor. Makes a nice snack.
review/text: Kind Healthy Grains is a cluster cereal made with whole grains like gluten-free oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, and quinoa. Other ingredients include gluten-free oat flour, flax seeds, evaporated cane juice, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E, citrus fiber and citrus pectin. It boasts to be all natural, low glycemic, no refined sugars, non gmo, no saturated fats, and low sodium.(According to the package, it contains soy and made in a facility that uses peanuts, thee nuts, and sesame seeds.) A serving size is 1/3 cup (29g). It contains 120 calories, 3g fat, 0 cholesterol, 20mg sodium, 22 g carbs (5 fiber, 5 sugar), and 3g of protein.<br /><br />The flavor for Kind Healthy Grains is pleasant and lightly sweet. It can be enjoyed in several ways: as a snack right out of the bag, as a topping, or as a cereal. For out-of-the-bag dry snacking, it's quite good. It's a moderate crunchy with a little bit of chewy. I tried Kind Healthy Grains with milk as a cereal. I didn't enjoy it as much that way. While it did taste good, the softening of the grains in the milk made it chewier and chewier taking longer and longer to finish it off. Eventually I gave up before the cereal was finished.<br /><br />Kind Healthy Grains come in a handy resealable bag that is not difficult to seal or open. Handy for on the go snacking or keeping in your gym bag.<br /><br />It's also made in the USA. Nice.

review/summary: Hearty but rancid?
review/text: I was excited to try this cereal, and when I eat granola, I like putting them on top of plain (perhaps just slightly sugared) oatmeal cereals. Hot.<br /><br />When I first opened the bag, I was surprised that it smelled a bit rancid... I wasn't sure whether or not that is how it's supposed to smell. However, the taste is great. It is very nutty, and very chewy/crunchy. It also doesn't become soggy quickly, even though I put it into hot oatmeal.<br /><br />My one slight complain would be that the bag does not seem to seal very well. It has the built-in seal, but it doesn't seal tightly - some light movements would open it. It also doesn't stand on its bottom, but that's probably not a huge deal.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this granola. It's very tasty.

review/summary: Tasty with good ingredients but missing something...
review/text: OK, I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to granola type products because a local bakery makes a great blend and my wife makes cookie sheet after cookie sheet of the best granola ever.  This Kind Healthy Grains, though, is no slouch.  The ingredients are high quality, generally whole, and vegan.  It's a nice snack, in small amounts.  Still, I was a bit disappointed in the taste and texture.  The blueberry flavor was too muted.  The added sweeteners overwhelmed the natural flavor of the grains and berries.  Vanilla was in there somewhere but its flavor, along with the flavors of all the other ingredients, lost their individual taste profiles.  The resulting melange is tasty but does not have that crunchy, whole grain flavor I was expecting.

review/summary: Tastes healthy but also delicious!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious taste of these cinnamon oat clusters. I am not super into organic food (in large part because of my budget), but I do often eat "organic" granola that I purchase at my local grocery store.<br /><br />My usual granola is more processed and contains more sugar than the KIND brand, so I was a little skeptical that the cinnamon oat clusters wouldn't taste very good. I was pleasantly surprised! They are delicious - plenty of flavor and plenty sweet, these do have more texture and fiber to them and are overall more hearty and filling than my grocery store brand. I really enjoyed them! They are yummy with milk or even just plain.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Try it as Breakfast Cereal
review/text: Promoted as a snack, I liked it best as a cold breakfast cereal. Tasty, and the cinnamon oat cluster flavor pretty much covered over the flax seed taste (not a big fan of the flax flavor though I know it is good for you). I got it as a sample 11 oz bag and got 4 bowls of cereal out of that size. It would be real handy for taking hiking or on the road when you can get milk for a good, filling, start to your day. Worth trying, worth buying.

review/text: I love granola. I'd rather eat granola than popcorn when I'm online or watching a movie.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IW4WFO">Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds,11 ounces</a> looked like a wonderful alternative. I mean, look at the name, look at the ingredients.<br /><br />The Kind Healthy Grains weren't too sweet, and were nice and crunchy.  While it had evaporated cane juice and molasses, a one third cup serving only had 6 grams of sugar.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the size of the clusters. They were more like the bottom of a bag of granola, with broken pieces. I couldn't just dip into the bag and neatly grab a handful.<br /><br />However, on the whole, I really liked this product, either standing alone or in some cottage cheese with fresh fruit.

review/summary: Great gluten free crunch granola
review/text: We've been gluten free for several years now, and one of the things that has been missing is a good, crunchy, gluten-free granola.<br /><br />The Vanilla Blueberry granola boasts a punch of delicious vanilla flavor and crunchy oat clusters. It's packed with a variety of healthy grains in addition to the gluten free oats.  It's a healthier granola.  The only downfall is the lack of blueberries in the granola. When a granola is labeled vanilla blueberry clusters, I tend to look for blueberries or at least a noticeable blueberry flavor. (The lack of blueberry is the reason for the 4 star instead of 5 star review.)<br /><br />The Cinnamon granola had a very nice cinnamon flavor. The granola tasted great with milk as well as eating plain as a snack.<br /><br />It would be nice if the granola came in larger packages as we went through the granola very quickly. If you use it on top of yogurt or ice cream, it will last much longer.

review/summary: Delicious whole grain goodness
review/text: Healthy grains seem to be in the news recently and cereal bars, granola and other whole grain foods claim to be tasty and good for you.  The people at Kind have mastered both taste and health in their healthy grains product.  I sampled vanilla blueberry Clusters with Flax seeds and found it to be the best "granola" I've ever tasted, except perhaps for the granola I have made myself.  It's delicious, low fat, and has an ingredient list that is easy to understand.  It can be enjoyed many ways, but just eating it out of the bag is great.<br /><br />Containing 5 g of fiber, 750 mg  of Omega 3 with 100 percent whole grains, its list of benefits also includes cholesterol free, low glycemic and low sodium, non GMO and finally, it has no trans or saturated fats.  Those claims are amazing since it actually tastes very good and is a good addition to your diet of grains.  It is indeed a "Kind" grain food.<br /><br />Other grains tend to be too sweet, or have had seeds or nuts that can crack teeth or get caught easily.  This granola is easy to munch, just eating it  out of the bag,  or using it for a topping,  or combining it  with milk almost like a cereal.  Since it's more expensive than cereal, I like to savor small batches of it when I'm hungry or use it as a yogurt topping.  I recommend trying it.  It's wholesome and quite a treat, a type of healthy "candy" for the conscientious eater.

review/summary: Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters
review/text: I tried these both as a snack and as a cereal.  As a snack, they tasted bland.  I was expecting more of the blueberry but I didn't get it.  Then I thought, maybe the milk would bring out the flavor, but it didn't.  Although a healthy snack, it didn't have the taste I was looking for and can always get a granola, flaxseed blend anywhere, if that's what I want.  Just average.

review/text: This is probably the best granola I have ever had. It only has 6 grams of sugar, where most granola cereals have 15 grams or more. The taste is incredible; a well rounded cinnamon flavor and the granola itself is pretty uniform in texture which I like. No huge clumps. The flax seeds are also a nice touch and lend good flavor to the mix. I also like the packaging. Its compact and easy to both open and seal back up. I was about to give up on store bought granola but this changed my mind. Love it.

review/text: I mixed this bag in with my Kashi cereal and am enjoying the combination.  The clusters aren't too large, the cinnamon isn't overpowering, and it gives a nice flavor to the Kashi.  I would readily use this to make Granola Bread, except I dumped the whole bag into the cereal, so I can't.  I think it would work quite well.  I also think it would be very good as part of home-made trail mix, with raisins and M&Ms and the like.  Depending on price at my local grocery store, I'd buy this.

review/summary: Love the crunch & taste but I have some issues with it.
review/text: Let's get the unpleasant stuff out of the way first:<br /><br />1. Calling this product "clusters" falls somewhere between false advertising and a grand exaggeration. Sure, there may be clusters in there (though I had to go spelunking to find them), but by no means are clusters a primary element of this snack.  That vast majority of the bag I received was loose bits.<br /><br />2. I opened the bag on the day I received it from Amazon and the first smell that hit me was rancid grain or oil--you know, when a box of cereal or crackers (or even a jar of peanut butter) go bad, they have that nasty stale smell?  Well that is what this smells like (at least the bag I got).  The "best by" date on the bag is August 29, 2012, so clearly the product is not outdated.  I HATE the rancid smell and will throw away snacks, cereals, crackers, etc., as soon as they start smelling that way, so it was tough to push past it to even try the granola.<br /><br />Now for the better news:<br /><br />1. While the product's strong rancid smell is off-putting, the taste is relatively pleasant (as long as I hold my breath or hold the bag away from my face when I'm pouring it out of or grabbing it from the bag to avoid the smell). There is SOME rancid taste, but I've been able to continue eating the granola on yogurt, ice cream or oatmeal--just not by itself.<br /><br />2. The package makes the following claims about this product: 5g fiber (per 1/3 cup serving), 720 mg Omega-3, gluten free, 100% whole grains, all natural, low glycemic, no refined sugars, NON GMO (whatever that means), no saturated fat or trans fats, cholesterol free and very low in sodium.  That's all pretty good news if you're looking for a healthier granola.  Total fat is 3.5mg per serving, sodium 20 mg, total carbs 22g, protein 3g and sugars 6g.  Also, as noted in the product title, the granola contains flax seeds.<br /><br />3. The crispy crunch on this stuff is awesome. I'm not sure what causes it, but it has a much lighter crispy type of crunch than most granola I've had (though admittedly I am not a big consumer of granola). I love it sprinkled on my ice cream and yogurt and even started putting it on my oatmeal.<br /><br />4. At 6g sugar, it is not super sweet, which is great.  It has a nice cinnamon taste and enough sweet for me but not too sweet.  They use evaporated cane juice and molasses for sweeteners.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Would I buy it again?  *IF* I could be assured that I would never get another bag that smells rancid, yes I would.  Otherwise, probably not.

review/summary: Tasty and healthy
review/text: I've tried a number of different granola cereals over the years (including the Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds ), and Kind Healthy Grains ranks among the best for taste. I'd call this moderately sweet, which is just fine with me, but it might make this less of a hit with people with more of a sweet tooth, especially kids. Of course, you can always add sugar, fruit or some other sweetener if you think it needs it.<br /><br />As the nutrition facts on the package reveal, this is a fairly healthy breakfast option. There's little fat in a 1/3-cup serving (3.5g/5% total fat, none of which is saturated or trans fat) with no cholesterol. There are 22g/7% carbs of which only 5g/20% are from sugar. There are also 5g/20% fiber, 20mg/1% sodium, and a serving has 130 calories.

review/summary: Absolutely Addictive
review/text: Oh my God is this stuff addictive. I really just ordered it because it was food and it was coming from the Vine program, so no risk. I opened it a few hours ago and the bag is like 1/3 gone. I'm a writer and one of the toughest parts of sitting at a computer all day is that if you have no self discipline (I have none) you snack all day. It's tough. You try to eat healthy things, but let's face it, you put a banana and a bag of M&Ms next to you on the desk and that banana is going to get eaten last. But this stuff is, if you can believe the label (and why wouldn't I?) very good for you--lots of grains, low carbs, low sodium, etc. So maybe (if I can afford it) I can sit here and munch and not feel half so guilty.<br /><br />I would imagine that this stuff will be very popular in airports where it's very hard to find anything healthy to bring on the plane with you. Fortunately, I rarely see bananas on sale in airports, so I eat the M&Ms guilt free :)<br /><br />But seriously, this stuff is great. And not too difficult to crunch either, which I sometimes worry about with granola, trail mix, etc. Of course, now I have to try the other flavors and I'm very intrigued by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IW4WFY">Kind Healthy Grains Dark Chocolate and Cranberry Clusters, 11-Ounces Bags (Pack of 3)</a>. Seriously? Chocolate hidden in a healthy snack? Man, that banana on the desk is going to get very old.

review/summary: Delicious and filling (just bring a toothbrush)
review/text: I'm big on granola in the fall and winter; for me, it's more satisfying, more filling, and it wards off the hunger pangs longer than cereal once the temperature starts to drop. (And before I start reaching for the oatmeal every day.) Because my personal "granola season" is fairly limited, I tend to be pretty selective, and in fact most years I make my own. This granola (or "Oat Clusters") isn't quite as good as homemade, but it is delicious; it fills you up; and it tides me over until lunch.<br /><br />I like the slight sweetness, that doesn't go overboard; I also like the mix of more solid "chunks" with smaller bits and grains. The cinnamon flavor is nice - definitely there - but not overpowering or cloying. In fact, the only thing I didn't like was what seemed - to me - to be a lot of sesame seeds (or seeds that looked like sesame), which got stuck in my teeth and gums no matter how much water I drank- even after two rounds of (sugar free) gum. It's not the end of the world of course, but it was a bit annoying; the next day I ate it I made sure to leave time to brush my teeth shortly afterwards, and all was well in the world.<br /><br />I'd definitely buy this again.

review/summary: Great Snack
review/text: This is a health food that reminds me a bit of cereal in a bag. It has vanilla flavoring with blueberries, flax seeds and grain clusters that are kind of like granola. It's high in fiber, has some protein, and is actually quite good. I've been eating it just as a snack but it also tastes good in yogurt. If you have a high powered food processor, it's good ground up as an addition to a smoothie. The package also suggests putting it in a bowl with milk like cereal, but I haven't done that.<br /><br />This is a gluten-free snack so that might be helpful. No artificial colors or flavors that I saw. Interestingly on the ingredients it indicates vitamin E was added but on the nutrition facts there is nothing about it. Strange I thought. Other than that, it's good, go for it!

review/text: Not quite sure if this was the taste they were going after, but they taste a lot like rice cakes.<br /><br />The grain mix doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste great considering that it does have evaporated cane juice, molasses, blueberry pure, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, and sea salt (among other ingredients).<br /><br />It is gluten free and is made from Amaranth, quinoa, otas, millet and buckwheat which is good.<br /><br />It just seems like with all the fruit purees and the cane juice that they'd taste a little better.<br /><br />If you can have nothing but gluten free snacks, then this can be an option for you.<br /><br />If dairy isn't off your diet, putting it on some yogurt would be good.<br /><br />It also suggests putting it with milk, but there are less expensive options if you're considering it for cereal.<br /><br />All in all, it's an okay snack.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I usually don't eat a lot of granola. I find that it's either too sweet or too bland and anything even remotely "healthy" doesn't taste very good just eaten by itself.<br /><br />That's not a problem here. I ate this just by itself and found that it has a nice light flavor - not too sweet and there isn't an overwhelming flavor of blueberries or vanilla - just a nice blend of the two. The flax seeds give it a slightly nutty flavor that blends well. It was crunchy, but not overly so. While it is a bit high in calories (120 calories for a serving (1/3 of a cup)), I like that I get 5 g of fiber (20% of my daily requirement) in a serving.<br /><br />I did find that in my package, there were few "clusters" and at over $5 for an 11 oz package, it seems a tad expensive (especially if you only buy this product and don't get the free shipping from Amazon). But I do like it and plan on trying their other flavors.

review/summary: Super healthy & guilt-free snacking
review/text: I've seen the KIND brand bars in stores but never had the chance to try their granola.  As you can see in the description, there's a plethora of "good for you" grains, such as amaranth, quinoa (grain of the Incas that is loaded with amino acids and fiber), oats, millet and buckwheat.  Plus it also has flax which we know is beneficial for its omega-3 fatty acids plus adds more fiber to the mix.  As for the taste, this is not your typical sweet granola with a lot of added sugar -- instead KIND granola contains evaporated cane juice & molasses as sweeteners.  I recommend adding it to yogurt with fruit if you are used to a sweeter tasting granola.  It's not bad on its own but may be lacking in the typical granola flavor for some.

review/summary: tasty granola
review/text: I wasn't very certain what to expect when they kept pushing 'healthy' and 'fiber' and the such in the description.  I figured it was good for me, but might have to choke down a handful to get the benefits.  Glad to say that Kind came out with a rather tasty granola without much in the way of fillers.<br /><br />The flavor is cinnamon, but it doesn't overwhelm the granola/grains. If anything, it's mild and more of an 'aftertaste' (if that can be a positive review).  It hits your tongue more after you're chewing than before and it's definitely not artificial.  The granola is more of a 'softer' kind than I've come across (probably because of the brown rice) so it's not as if you're chewing on rocks and a welcome change.  It goes very well with yogurt since it's not too strong of a flavor and it does make a good cereal.  Since there are less sweetners (molasses and cinnamon seem to be it), you get more granola per serving than others I've noticed (1/3 a cup compared to 1/4) but it still has a great taste (i.e. not cardboard).<br /><br />Definitely will keep a bag on hand for punching up yogurt or for a healthy snack.  Also, it claims to be gluten-free (I'm not an expert on this), which is a nice option to have on hand for anyone who has gluten allergies.

review/text: This KIND cereal (vanilla blueberry clusters) had good flavor and consistency. Sometimes when cereal has fruit they don't include enough but this had plenty of blueberries. It was equally good dry or with milk and I typically don't prefer cereal without milk.<br /><br />The packaging is attractive and works well. It's not the cheapest cereal but you get what you pay for in the quality of the ingredients. I would recommend it; it's healthy and tastes good.

review/summary: Excellent granola, not too sweet
review/text: I'm a big fan of Kind bars when I need a healthy snack or light meal replacement, so I was excited to try their new granola.  Like the bars, this loose granola isn't too sweet and has a nice balance of protein and carbs.  The cinnamon flavor is noticeable but not overwhelming, and the texture is crunchy without cutting up the roof of my mouth.  And unlike other granola I've had, this stuff is actually good enough to eat "on-the-go," rather than only combined with yogurt or milk.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Awesome breakfast cereal or treat!!
review/text: My first thought was that this tastes like Cinammon Toast Crunch cereal... without the three layers of sugar to get to flake.  The level of cinammon was perfect - not overpowering.  The firmness and crispness were dead on too... held up well with both yogurt and milk as well as solo (fist snacking).<br /><br />The fiber is high which is great.  The sugar level makes this more of a snack than a staple for me and I would caution anyone with blood sugar issues to look carefully at the nutrition labels.  That said, I think it is a wonderful treat and change of pace from my current paleo diet - I will make it a regular part of my once a week "cheater" days.  For those without diet issues, I would highly recommend as a daily breakfast or snack option.  It reallly tastes good!!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay

review/text: I think we have a winner here. The packaging promises that the product is all natural, and only contains things you can pronounce. It does, too.<br /><br />Flavor was very nice, and not too sweet. This product contains flax, which I don't particularly care for, but the flax wasn't noticeable. This does have a decent amount of sesame seeds in it. While I don't mind the taste of sesame seeds they did tend to get stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />I ate this both dry and as a cereal with milk. It was great  both ways.<br /><br />To me the real test for any food is: will my kids eat it? In this case the answer is a resounding yes. Additionally, I brought this along to munch on at a swim meet, and the kids on the team wanted a taste. They all liked it, too.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised!
review/text: This is my first experience with any sort of healthy grain snack. I have to say, I've become a fan. I find it difficult to enjoy healthier options because I do have such a sweet tooth but with the vanilla and the blueberry mixed in with these grains I don't miss the sugar. Plus, it helps to know that this snack is very healthy, not to mention quite tasty. When I think of healthy I don't usually think it will taste good as well.<br /><br />I've actually been looking for ways to add some sort of Omega-3 into my diet but it's been difficult because I don't like fish. This snack is full of flax seed which is full of the heart healthy Omega-3.<br /><br />When I first received the bag I thought, this reminds me of cereal. While reading the back label it actually say's you can add milk and have it just that way. I've yet to do that because I brought this product into work to have as a breakfast filler. It works perfectly for that as helps control your appetite. It fills me up and I feel good knowing it's a healthier option than what I'd usually go for.<br /><br />For me I'm so happy I found this product. Its low in sugar, full of Omega-3, and is made with 100% whole grains. They suggest trying this on top of yogurt or with milk. Both seem like delicious ideas that I can't wait to try.<br /><br /> I am pleasantly surprised I like this. I'll definitely be getting it again.

review/text: I recently reviewed another flavor of Kind Healthy Grains. The one here was a little less dry and tastier than the other. Also, it had more of what I would call clusters which made it easier to eat right out of the bag.<br /><br />As with the other, I think eating with milk or with yogurt would work out well. I only tried it out of the bag so far.<br /><br />I liked both flavors, but this one was a little better in my opinion.<br /><br />A bit pricey perhaps, but it seems to be very healthy.

These are delicious-probably one of the best foods I have reviewed on Amazon and certainly the best as far as gluten-free goes. I enjoyed these straight out of the bag, and as a cereal. They are sweet but not too sweet, and have a surprisingly low glycemic index which is important for those who need or like to monitor their blood sugar. One caveat thought: The clusters come apart quite easily. This didn't bother me, but this may be a concern for those looking for an on-the-go snack.

review/summary: Light, flavorful, healthy and satisfying
review/text: I'm a bit granola obsessed, always on the search for a great tasting and healthy blend of ingredients. With reasonable effort to avoid hyperbole, Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters might be the best granola I have tried. The diverse grains are sweet and crispy, the nutrients are plentiful, and the price is right. I generally eat the granola dry, straight from the package, but I have eaten it with almond milk, making for a delicious, nutritious breakfast.<br /><br />For those who are curious, here is a breakdown of the nutritional content, as well as ingredients:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1/3 cup (29g)<br />Servings Per Package: About 11<br /><br />Calories: 120<br />Calories from Fat: 30<br />Total Fat: 3g (5%)<br />Saturated: 0g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 20mg (1%)<br />Total Carb.: 22g (7%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 5g (20%)<br />Sugars: 5g<br />Protein: 3g<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin.<br /><br />The blueberry flavor is, perhaps, a little too subtle, getting lost in the mix of the grains, but it does make its presence known. The variety of grains included is more robust than many other brand I have tried, especially the inclusion of quinoa. So there is a little something to please everyone.<br /><br />So, for those seeking a delicious, healthy granola blend, I highly recommend Kind Vanilla Blueberry Clusters. For my money, it may be the best grain blend on the market!

review/summary: A tasty treat with omega-3s for all
review/text: Because I'm a vegetarian it's a little tricky getting those highly touted omega-3s in my diet so I'm always happy to find food source that does the job.  This tasty granola contains flax seeds (hence the omega-3s) and a veritable cornucopia of whole grains including amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet, brown rice and buckwheat, but no wheat so it's gluten-free.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  It does have evaporated cane juice and molasses, but a one third cup serving only has 6 grams of sugar. That same serving size has 5 grams of fiber, 3 grams of protein, 130 calories and only 3.5 grams of fat and 20 mg of sodium so unless you overdo it, and because it is delicious that's possible, it's a guilt-free food.  It's great straight out of the bag, or with milk or (my favorite) yogurt.  There are several other flavors and they all sound good so I know I'll be checking them out too.  Since there's no honey or dairy I believe this would be good for vegans.

review/summary: Tasty - A review from a health food novice
review/text: I couldn't honestly care less about flax seeds and all the other mumbo jumbo on the packaging.  I guess I can just trust that it's all good stuff.  With a brand name like "Kind" it's a leap of faith I'm willing to take.  What I do know, however, is this stuff is tasty.<br /><br />The smell from the bag is earthy, with a little cinnamon, a little oat.  It reminded me of family drives as a kid when we used to roll down the windows while passing the Quaker Oats factory in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Very inviting.<br /><br />Smell is not sufficient, so I had to eat this bag of goodies.  VERY impressed.  One thing I hate about a lot of granola (oat clusters) is that it's crumbled too much.  You end up with thousands of tiny chunks.  This is not true with the Kind brand.  There are big and small chunks, with the right texture and crunch.  Added to that is a simply delicious flavor; it's like health-food candy.  Each bite is like cheating a diet.  Delicious cinnamon flavoring without being overpowering.  I highly recommend it in milk as a healthy alternative to sugary cereals, or in handfuls while hiking through multi-colored forest landscapes that pleasantly make time disappear.

review/text: I ordered this because I love oat clusters and stuff like this for breakfast with some almond milk.  When I got it the first thing I did was read the ingredients and to my dismay, one of the things in this bag is Chickory Root extract.  :(  This is an ingredient that companies put into their products to bump the fiber content.  But in doing so it causes excess gas and bloating.  This is one of the key ingredients that I avoid when looking for healthy foods to buy.  I did taste the product and it is actually very good and if I didn't know it would upset my stomach I would really enjoy it.  I hope I can find something like this without Chickory root in it.  I would recommend it for the flavor if you don't care about that one ingredient.  (the same one used in all Fiber One products to make them so high in fiber)

review/summary: Fantastic Taste and Texture
review/text: I enthusiastically recommend this product, primarily for its vastly superior taste and texture. Although nothhing tastes like a blueberry as much as a blueberry, once you adjust (about 4 initial mouthfuls) the KIND version of blueberry, you'll not only love the taste, but it will seem close enough to the real thing that you'll have a Blueberry Experience!  NOt too crunchy, yet not too soft or crumbly, these have a great blueberry/flax/cinnamon flavor which I loved. (Non-cinnamon fans should stay away).<br /><br />The product is slightly pricey, but this is offset by how filling it is--especially when consumed with water.  I'd recommend this as a pick-me-up/snack almost anytime,; for example, while at the office, on a hike, taking a break from a bike ride, etc. The ingredients tasted fresh (one unlucky reviewer reported a "rancid" ingredient). Overall a very tasty and satisfying snack food.  Highly recommended!

review/text: People, people, people! Lend me your eyes for this review. I promise it will be worth your while. I am going to attempt to describe just how delicious, wholesome and nutritious this fabulous new addition to the granola/oat cluster world is. For starters, KIND uses ingredients you can easily pronounce and recognize. These clusters are packed full of whole grains like quinoa, amaranth and oats. They are dusted with a healthy dose of cinnamon and are nutty, slightly sweet and incredibly satisfying. Yes, they are made with cane juice. But, the grains are so whole that you don't feel that "crash and burn" sensation after you've consumed them. Trust me, I consumed them in full force. My mother and I killed the bag in about two days. You can eat them as a terrific "on the go" food, or with milk/yogurt. Go forth and try them now.

review/text: These Clusters remind me a lot of Cracker Jacks. Do they still make them? Obviously they do, since I have found a link to them in Amazon groceries. The Clusters do not come with a toy inside or with peanuts, but they do come in nice crunchy bite size clumps, except maybe for the unclumped bits, which appear to be sinking to the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />I have been eating them out of the bag, which has a built in seal strip. They are not too sweet, having only a few grams of sugar per serving of 29 grams, i.e. around one ounce. The ingredients are nothing scary, just the usual unusual grains: amaranth, flax, millet, and quinoa. How did they miss my favorite, spelt?<br /><br />These are good tasting, and presumably good for you. What could be better?

review/summary: Tastes good, high calories
review/text: I bought this snack mainly because my wife and daughter are big fans of the Kashi brand of cereals. Since the ingrediants and composition of this Kind snack seemed similiar, I thought they might like it too.<br /><br />Taste-wise, my wife liked it the same or better (though my pre-school daughter didn't). Unfortunately, the calorie count here is quite a bit more, enought that my wife won't eat them. There is more protein and fiber in this snack, though, so that's a plus.<br /><br />Bottom line, it depends on what you're looking for in a health snack. These blueberry clusters taste good, and have higher protein and fiber. But beware the high calories.

review/summary: GF and no hidden ingredients!
review/text: This granola was true to it's label - "ingredients you can see and pronounce". I was very pleased to find only real, healthy ingredients and appreciated that both the product and the oats in the ingredient list were identified as GF. This company clearly understands and accommodates the needs of its customers with dietary restrictions.<br /><br />The granola was great by itself with just milk, and the resealable top bag would make this a great travel option. I also expect this would be a fantastic subbed in as the crumb topping for apple or pear crisp. At only 130 calories and 6g of sugar per serving, this is a snack-friendly food. Definitely recommend it.<br /><br />If you're on the go, consider trying these by the same company - also a great product: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0DMME">KIND PLUS, Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>

review/text: This is just like many breakfast cereals like Honey bunch of oats at the supermarket.<br /><br />This one is in a resealable plastic bag with a ziplock style closure.<br /><br />The taste is good with vanilla flavoring. There were no blueberries but just some tiny blueberry fragments.

review/summary: Perfect in Yogurt or on Cereal
review/text: I try to eat healthy, and I try to buy products that are not filled with chemicals or additives, and are made in the USA. Kind Healthy Grains meets all of those requirements, plus it tastes great. Every morning, I mix two very healthy but exceptionally dull tasting cereals together. Now, I've started adding just a small handful of Kind Healthy Grains, and it's made a world of difference! We also mix the Kind Healthy Grains in yogurt, and sometimes eat it straight from the bag as a snack.<br /><br />Kind Healthy Grains reminds me of granola, but although it's crunchy, it's not hard like granola. The ingredients are a world of difference--no saturated fats or additives! Kind Healthy Grains are just that--grains without refined sugars, trans fats, or saturated fat. The taste is sweet, but not too sweet, and it doesn't seem like you're eating a health food.<br /><br />My husband and I liked this so much, we will buy more from Amazon.

review/summary: Tasty AND Nutritious AND...try for yourself
review/text: Guaranteed to please even finicky eaters who don't like quinoa, amaranth or anything that looks like health food, or even people who want to eat healthy but are in need of a good recommendation. The nutty cinnamon taste was a pleasure, and the bag was gone within two days of its arrival. I highly recommend it with blueberries although it can stand on its own. You may not forget you're eating "fiber," but the cinnamon keeps you perking all morning.

review/summary: Delicious Blend of Whole Grains
review/text: Kind's Cinnamon Oat Clusters is an all natural granola that contains no refined sugars, no saturated fat, and no trans fats.  It is also low in sodium and is cholesterol free.<br /><br />Whereas many products that claim these healthy attributes struggle to meet the savory flavor of the packaging they come in, Kind's Cinnamon Oat Clusters have an enjoyable taste.  Ingredients include: whole grains of gluten free oats, brown rice, buckwheat amaranth, millet, quinoa, flax seeds, chicory root fiber cinnamon, and evaporated cane juice.<br /><br />Kind's Cinnamon Oat Clusters go great with yogurt, and make a delicious breakfast cereal.  They are also good with ice cream as well as straight out of the bag.<br /><br />I would recommend Kind's Cinnamon Oat Clusters to anybody who likes granola.  Kind also has other flavors to choose froml, such as Vanilla Blueberry, Oats & Honey with Toasted Coconut, Peanut Butter, and Dark Chocolate & Cranberry.

review/text: What can I say ... I opened this bag thinking I would just have a little taste and then put it in the pantry. I was wrong.<br /><br />This bag of goodness doesn't taste too much of cinnamon--it has a good, even mix of flavors that blend well on the tongue. I loved the addition of flax seeds--very good for the cholesterol levels. The contents stay nice and crunchy in the bag, and you can seal it ...<br /><br />if you don't finish that bag off first.

review/summary: Tasty Mix!
review/text: Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds,11 ounce bag (Pack of 3) is not loaded with sugar, has a decent amount of fiber content, and the combination of the 3 make for a tasty mix. As a morning choice appears to be a healthy one. Several people have tried this product in our household and they all gave it thumbs up. Sometimes it is hard for everyone to agree on what they like best for their first meal of the day and with this one there was no dissension. Like always we are very happy that thanks to Amazon.com we got to try this food item and have to say that it is good news when companies offer healthy mixes to people in general.  A new trend of healthier foods seem to be on the rise and being that most everyone wants or needs to stay healthy it is a very good thing to be able to buy these products instead of less beneficial choices. For its merits and for the taste this choice rates a 4 Stars at the minimum. The name of the company (KIND) is an indication of good tidings in this case.

review/summary: Was just okay
review/text: I tried this soon after it arrived. It is crunchy and has good ingredients, but something in it tasted a bit weird to me. Maybe this is because I usually make my own granola.  I tried this plain and also in a bowl of almond milk. It stayed crunchy with no problem. I would probably recommend this for late afternoon snacks or for hikers to take with them on the trail. I don't know why the taste was off to me. I really wanted to like it more, but couldn't.

review/summary: Healthy Snack - But Watch the Calories
review/text: I received the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters in a 11 oz bag.  I'm fairly health conscious and I'm happy to report that these seem to fit the bill as part of a healthy diet.  Each serving contains a generous amount of fiber (5g) and Omega-3s (750mg).  It is also claimed to be gluten free which is becoming more important as people discover their sensitivity to gluten.  Since I'm watching blood pressure, I always look at sodium content and I was happy to see only 20mg per serving.  Sugar is a little high at 5g per serving* which I will explain later.<br /><br />Although this product could be great in yogurt or with milk, I just ate it raw from the bag. The texture was perfect for me.  It was neither too crunchy nor too soft, but just the right amount of chewiness.  The flavor was a little strong for me.  It overwhelmingly tasted of vanilla extract.  I prefer a lighter more subtle flavor, but that is subjective.<br /><br />Aside from the flavor, there are a few other cautions. The serving size is only 1/3 cup.  This is unrealistically small.  Few people will only consume that amount unless  sprinkling it on yogurt or grabbing a handful for a quick snack.  If eating it like cereal or a significant snack, 2/3 to 1 cup is more realistic.  As with all granola type snacks, the calories then become an issue.  At 120 calories per small serving, a 1 cup consumption (3 servings) would amount to 360 calories.  Sugar would rise to 15 grams.  My average snack amount was about 2/3 cup or 240 calories which is still pretty high.  At that level, I also suffered from a little gastrointestinal distress - probably from the flax seed which my body wasn't used to.<br /><br />Overall, I give this a 4 out of 5 star rating.  It is a healthy food with relatively low levels of sodium and high levels of fiber.  Those who are weight conscious need to watch the serving sizes as the calories can really add up.  But I give this product a positive recommendation as a tasty and healthy food.

review/summary: Crispy, light and incredibly flavorful
review/text: As a huge fan of KIND bars, and as a granola-crazed eater, I eagerly took the opportunity to try KIND Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters. I was not disappointed. The diverse grains are sweet and crispy, the nutrients are plentiful, and the price is right. I generally eat the granola dry, straight from the package, but I have eaten it with both almond milk and yogurt, making for a delicious, nutritious breakfast or snack.<br /><br />For those who are curious, here is a breakdown of the nutritional content, as well as ingredients:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1/3 cup (29g)<br />Servings Per Package: About 11<br /><br />Calories: 130<br />Calories from Fat: 30<br />Total Fat: 3g (5%)<br />Saturated: 0g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 20mg (1%)<br />Total Carb.: 22g (7%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 5g (20%)<br />Sugars: 6g<br />Protein: 3g<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, cinnamon, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate).<br /><br />The cinnamon flavor really shines in this, which is a big improvement over other brands of granola, where the flavor tends to get lost in the mix. The variety of grains is incredibly robust, especially the inclusion of quinoa. So there is a little something to please everyone.<br /><br />So, for those seeking a delicious, healthy granola blend, I highly recommend KIND Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters!

review/summary: Whole grains, superfoods and it tastes great!
review/text: I recently fell in love with Kind Fruit and Nut bars, so when I discovered that Kind also made granola, I couldn't wait to check it out.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of eating healthy and Kind has become a go-to brand for me as it's all natural and offers everything from whole grains to omega-3's to fiber and more. The Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds combine antioxidant rich cinnamon, flax seeds and whole grains amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet and buckwheat. These clusters are high in fiber, contain 720mg of omega-3 fatty acids and 16g of whole grains per serving and one third cup serving is only 130 calories!<br /><br />Anyone who loves cinnamon will love these. They're great for eating out of the bag, having with milk, or mixing with yogurt and they also offer just the right crunch. I can't wait to try the different flavors that Kind has to offer.

review/summary: Addictive and healthy
review/text: I was previously only familiar with the Kind brand through their yummy (though very sweet) granola bars available at Borders and various locations. This is the first time I have tried their granola. I like that it can be topped on yogurt or eaten as cereal. It is important that my food products be able to multitask that way. It is just the right amount of sweet, and fairly addictive. I think that it is basically healthy but keep in mind it is high calorie if you eat more than a handful. A good treat, though use sparingly if trying to lose weight. Cinnamony granola goodness. Yum.

review/text: If you are used to healthy eating, you'll like it. It's fragrant, not too sweet for me, (also with a hint of honey), crunchy and very filling after about a cup of it.<br /><br />By healthy eating, I mean...you are used to food that doesn't have a lot of artificial flavorings, oil, or sugar. Flax seeds have a nutty flavor in them. They are where Omega-3 fatty acids come from. I tasted them alone before. They also taste a bit like "olive oil," but very subtle in these Cinnamon Oat clusters.<br /><br />I really enjoy eating them out of the bag. It's perfect for snacking and on the go. It doesn't make me tired or sluggish after like a piece of cake would do.

review/text: If you must eat gluten-free, this is a great option. Unlike some gluten-free products, this granola is flavorful and easy to find. Most groceries now stock it in with regular granola products. I was a bit skeptical about the flax seed, but this flavor is very yummy. Tastes like cinnamon, but without being overwhelming. I have been stirring it into my yogurt each morning and also eating as a snack mixed with dried fruits. I would definitely buy this again.

With a high source of fiber, 750mg of omega-3 fatty acids and 16g of whole grain, you can feel good about eating this.  It's very economical and convenient.  I look forward to trying other flavors!

review/text: Contains fiber, omega-3's and other good things, but what does it taste like?<br /><br />Actually, it tastes pretty good - sort of nutty and the cinnamon is there, but not overpowering.<br /><br />I tried it as is from the bag. Was a little dry and the pieces are a little small to handle when eaten that way. But still, not bad.<br /><br />The package suggests eating it in milk or on yogurt which I think would be a good way to eat the product. I'll have to try that and get back to you.<br /><br />From what I can see, the price works out to be about $6 for 11 ounces. Sounds a little high, but it is very healthy stuff. I'd say give it a try.

review/text: What can you say about granola? If you like granola, and you want it to be additive free, this is for you. Kind Blueberry clusters with Flax seeds has whole grains such as amaranth, quinoa, oats, milet and buckwheat. It also has apple, blueberry and plum puree that act like raisins,you get an occasional lump of one to add to the taste. There is no refined sugar since the cereal is sweetened with apple juice. To me it tastes like granola that is not too sweet and has a flax seed kick (watch out, they can get stuck in your teeth). The serving is 1/3 a cup (kind of skimpy if you ask me). Another reviewer mentioned it was too crunchy and sweet. Considering granola is crunchy, that shouldn't be a surprise and this is about as sweet as unsweetened applesauce. To me baklava is too sweet. This granola, not even even close.<br /><br />Here is the breakdown of the nutrient values.<br /><br />Calories 120<br />Fat 3g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 20mg<br />Total Carb 22g<br />Fiber 5g<br />Sugars 5g<br />Protein 3g<br /><br />You aren't going to get more "No ____ Added" than this.

review/text: My title is because I expected this too be as flavorful as bland oatmeal with  bits of blueberry flavoring. I am happy too say that for a healthy alternative that this tasted good as a snack out of the bag or as a cereal. I ate them both ways. The blue berries are very small and lightly add their taste too this product, but I did taste them and they seemed too be in every bite. This blend of grains with the added fruit was easily able too satisfy my hunger and my taste buds. Yes I will say it again; I was pleasantly surprised. One-third of a cup is the serving size and is 120 calories. As a snack this is quite filling so its serving size worked for me. This is a healthy product I would not only eat again but I do recommend it.

review/summary: Yum
review/text: Indeed, I had no clusters in my shipment, just a few clumps in a sea of grains.  Not deterred, I really liked the flavor of the product.  It echoes the quality and general flavor of other Kind offerings.  Its texture is a little more brittle-like than I prefer in granola, which seems to contribute to it being very sweet and candy-like.  This is the one factor that would keep me from enjoying it regularly.  The flavor of the grains is very nice, though the blueberry could come through a bit more.<br /><br />The inclusion of whole flax seeds is a bit distressing, however.  Whole flax seeds are hard to chew, which when factored into being indigestible would seem that their health benefit is somewhat lost.  Generally speaking, this granola is a tasty treat, though not something I could keep as a staple in the pantry.

review/text: My wife is trying to eat ultra-healthy, so I ordered these as a treat for her.  She loves them.  The package size is convenient for her to take to work.  She works 12 hour days at the hospital, so having some quick energy food helps get her through the long day.They make her happy, and that makes me happy.

review/summary: I can't stop eating it
review/text: I received a package of this through Vine and thank god I only received one package.  I'm pretty sure they put something addictive in it because I can't stop eating it, in fact, I've almost polished off the bag without milk.  It is absolutely fantastic and (obviously) works just as well as a snack as a breakfast cereal.  The cinnamon is faint and not overpowering like some cereals.  It is good and crunchy and if you read the label while you are consuming it, you will want to pat yourself on the back for putting such good stuff in your body.  Be kind to yourself and order a bag.  It is delish!

review/summary: Really delicious
review/text: I love granola, and probably go through a box or two every few weeks.  One of my favorite brands has been Kashi since it's pretty healthy overall, and doesn't have a lot of added sugar.  This KIND granola, however, takes the cake: it's one of the best-tasting commercial granolas I've tried!<br /><br />Granola can often be high in fat, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that one serving of this (1/3 cup) has only 3 grams of fat (5% of your daily value).  While it still has the typical higher calorie counts that granolas usually have, coming in at 120 calories, it's really high in fiber (5g, or 20%). The ingredients are all-natural, and, overall, it's a really healthy option if you like granola.<br /><br />A granola isn't worth its weight in grain, however, if it doesn't taste good, and this one is delicious!  Even my husband, who's not a huge granola lover, really liked this one when we were sampling it, and he came back for more.<br /><br />I also like how this has nice, big clusters, so that you can actually grab some out of the bag and snack on it.  Granolas that have smaller clusters have to be mixed into cereal or eaten with milk, but not this one.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be delicious and am happy to have been able to try this out. I will definitely re-purchase it!

review/summary: Perfect snack
review/text: I found this granola-like product to be extremely tasty straight out of the bag.  It is slightly, very slightly, sweet and not loaded with sodium.  I can munch away and not wish I hadn't later on.  I love that it's gluten-free too.  It's made with a variety of wholesome ingredients and is crunchy without being hard.  Tomorrow I plan to try some with rice milk poured over it then another day tossed in with mixed nuts.  Wonderful product - kudos to the makers.

review/summary: Tasty and lots of good ingredients, but very SWEET
review/text: I usually eat Kashi granola and was interested to try this product.  I noticed on the label that it has much less sodium than my usual Kashi but about the same amount of sugars (6 g) and half the fat.  I'd be curious how the "low glycemic index" claim is made... my big issue with this granola is that it is VERY SWEET... like DESSERT sweet and I'm not one who shuns sugar (try saying that 5 times fast!).  Googling "calculate glycemic index" tells me that the index is very subjective and difficult for the ordinary person to calculate.  But my experience tells me that food that tastes this sweet is usually not low on that scale.<br /><br />I'd echo other reviewers' comments - this product is delicious and provides lots of whole grains.  If sugar is not much of an issue for you (e.g. if you are not carbohydrate sensitive) then you might try a bag of this... just treat it as a dessert as like all granola it is high in calories.<br /><br />If the sugars level in this product were cut in half, I'd give it TEN STARS!<br /><br />Hope this is helpful.

review/summary: Good enough, nothing to write home about
review/text: First off, I want to note that the motto printed on the package is "Ingredients you can see and pronounce." The good people at Kind have grossly over-estimated my ability to pronounce D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate. But I'm working on it.<br /><br />So I tried this both plain (on the go style) and with milk. Plain it would make a decent easy to carry snack, although I'd probably add some raisins and nuts to jazz it up. I like the cinnamon flavor.<br /><br />With milk it makes a so so cereal substitute. It's a little hard to chew once it gets wet. Again, adding at least raisins would help make it more exciting.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not really sure who this is intended for. I guess it's nice that it's gluten free for those with a gluten sensitivity, and I'm sure 720mg Omega-3 means something to someone or they wouldn't be bragging about it on the bag. But it has 22 grams of carbs and 6 grams of sugar per 1/3 cup serving. I'd rather it had less sugar. It's supposed to be health food, right?<br /><br />Overall I was stuck between 3 and 4 stars. It tasted good, but was a bit boring, and the texture in milk got annoying. I would probably not try it again.

review/summary: Has Potential
review/text: It has a great collection of grains, it tastes good, and even has chicory root fiber, a great prebiotic (selectively nurtures beneficial bacteria in the gut). And the package opens easily and seals back up easily, which is very unusual for a cereal for some reason.<br /><br />The downsides: It smells a little like rancid oil. And although it's nice and crunchy, there is an extra little crunch at the end of the bite that is too much, like a little seed that is a little too hard and cracks more than crunches at the end. And the little seeds got stuck in my teeth.

review/summary: Crunchy Bite Size Clumps
review/text: These Clusters remind me a lot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P4H57Q">Cracker Jacks</a>. Do they still make them? Obviously they do, since I have found a link to them in Amazon groceries. The Clusters do not come with a toy inside or with peanuts, but they do come in nice crunchy bite size clumps, except maybe for the unclumped bits, which appear to be sinking to the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />I have been eating them out of the bag, which has a built in seal strip.  They are not too sweet, having only a few grams of sugar per serving of 29 grams, i.e. around one ounce. The ingredients are nothing scary, just the usual unusual grains: amaranth, flax, millet, and quinoa.  How did they miss my favorite, spelt?<br /><br />These are good tasting, and presumably good for you. What could be better?

review/summary: Unbelievably flavorful gourment granola
review/text: Absolutely delicious granola -- all the ingredients are toasted to perfection and the resulting texture ("Mouthfeel") is incredible. Not at all the dessicated twigs and seeds of something like Grape Nuts cereal or 1970s style crunchy granola of yore. This stuff is delicious with amazing flavors, perfectly toasted. It's not only the best cereal of its kind I've ever tasted, it's better than I ever imagined granola could be. The drawback is the price. But you get what you pay for. Absolutely 100% recommended. Good and good for you.

review/text: I like that it's healthy and natural. And I like this company. I just don't think this is a great recipe.<br /><br />Other than a fun crispy texture, the taste is just really unexciting. They sent me a free bag to review, and I'm definitely not motivated to buy a refill. In fact I'm not even very motivated to finish the bag they sent.<br /><br />If you don't mind high sugar, try this same company's granola bars. For example: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0DMME">KIND PLUS, Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />For healthy, low-sugar, natural cereal, it's back to Bob's Red Mill Muesli for me.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDSES">Bob's Red Mill Cereal Muesli,  4 - 18-Ounce Bags</a>

review/summary: Tastes good and good for you
review/text: I've tried a number of different granola cereals over the years, and Kind Healthy Grains ranks among the best for taste.  I'd call this moderately sweet, which is just fine with me, but it might make this less of a hit with people with more of a sweet tooth, especially kids.  Of course, you can always add sugar, fruit or some other sweetener if you think it needs it.<br /><br />As the nutrition facts on the package reveal, this is a fairly healthy breakfast option.  There's little fat in a 1/3-cup serving (3g/5% total fat, none of which is saturated or trans fat) with no cholesterol.  There are 22g/7% carbs of which only 5g are from sugar.  There are also 5g/20% fiber, 20mg/1% sodium, and a serving has 120 calories.

review/summary: Every thing good for you and tasty too!
review/text: Sometimes granola can taste a little like sweetened wood chips with a few nuts and raisins thrown in. It's good for you but not particularly pleasant. I am however impressed with THIS product. Sold with the byline of a cereal with products you can pronounce! The real test is whether something that is pronouncable is also edible. The answer is yes! I have eaten it raw and with milk and each time it is both satisfying nutritionally but also in terms of taste. The organic and health food marketplace is becoming increasingly crowded. However there is still plenty of room for tasty and healthy alternatives to over sweet cereals. Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds is a worthy competitor in the healthfood marketplace. Enjoy!

review/summary: Tasty Low-Fat Granola
review/text: For some reason, the package of these "healthy grains" doesn't use the word "granola."<br /><br />Funny -- the product sure looks, smells, and tastes like granola to me.<br /><br />But I notice it's very low-fat -- maybe that's the distinction.<br /><br />And it does seem to include some unusual ingredients -- amaranth, quinoa, millet, buckwheat, and flax seeds.  I don't believe I've ever HEARD of some of those before!<br /><br />The package suggests that you can eat this stuff with milk -- as cereal -- or on top of yogurt, or just straight out of the pack.<br /><br />I chose the latter, and it made for a tasty snack, to be sure.  This vanilla-blueberry flavor is unusual and not too sweet, with a hint of a burnt flavor.<br /><br />The only reason I deducted one star from my score is the high price -- more than five bucks for an 11-ounce package.  That's not much more than regular granola, but then I think that most regular granola is stupidly overpriced as well.<br /><br />At any rate, if you'd like to try a tasty low-fat granola-like snack -- and you have the discretionary income -- this may be just your KIND of granola.

review/summary: Very nice snack food
review/text: This is a nice-tasting "granola" product, and it's on the crunchier end of granola products that I've tried. Though it has a strange finish in the taste, that's more obvious in this flavor than the other. I think that must be the flax seeds, which I'm not used to. But that's part of what makes this snack so healthy. It is hard to believe they packed 750mg of omega-3's into 1/3 cup serving. That's pretty impressive. I thought I would prefer this flavor, but I actually preferred the vanilla blueberry, it seemed to work better with the flax seeds.<br /><br />The product is great as a standalone snack, but it didn't do so hot in my soy milk. Think the cinnamon clashed or something. Probably do fine in regular dairy milk. The crunchy texture holds up well to liquids. The other flavor was fine in the soy milk. Both flavors went well in my coconut-milk-based yogurt.

review/text: My impression after the first bite was not what I expected. I did not get the essence of either vanilla or blueberry. It was more like a card board box. But as I soldiered on, I found myself really liking it. And that is saying something, because I am not the healthiest eater.<br /><br />After my initial reluctance, I was all willing to make this my snack of choice. But I was thwarted because, at least in my package, after the first third of the bag, the only clusters I could find were in the name on the bag. I guess I will have to use it as a yogurt topping.<br /><br />Over all, this is unexpected and improves greatly on closer acquaintance.

review/text: These oat clusters were good for snacking as well as for breakfast.  While they are touted as clusters, I found that they broke into sub-clusters too quickly (i.e. they turned into something better eaten with a spoon rather than with fingers).  Great on its own or mixed with milk or plain yogurt.  The list of ingredients places the product squarely in the "actually natural" vs. the "marketed as natural" category.  Good stuff.

review/summary: Good, but is better in something rather than by itself
review/text: I've eaten more than my fair share of granola in the past few years. It's handy, carries around well, nutritious, and tastes great. (It's also good for you!) This just didn't grab me as much as I wanted it to, unfortunately.<br /><br />This travels extremely well, which is something that's very important to me in food products. (Hey, people at work like to scavenge from the fridge so anything I can keep with me is a bonus.) The granola has a lot of good vitamins and nutrients in it, which is one of the big things I look at as far as food goes. I also liked that the company also tries to help people beyond just offering nutritious food, which is part of the reason I chose this item to review.<br /><br />The only problem is that this isn't really the end all of granola I was hoping it'd be. I was really looking forward to something great but this just kind of came up short in my opinion. It's good and has less sugar than my regular granola bars, but taste-wise it just wasn't really something I'd go out of my way to buy. I think it was the vanilla, to be honest. It seemed to really get in the way of the blueberry and granola taste, which is disappointing since I do like the taste of vanilla. This did seem to lessen when you add it to things, so if you're someone who likes their granola in yogurt or soymilk this probably won't bother you as much. (I prefer mine plain.)<br /><br />If you see this on the shelves it's worth a try and I am curious about some of the other flavors this company has to offer, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get this. It's not going to be replacing my Kashi cereal, that's for certain.

review/summary: Quite tasty and crunchy health snack
review/text: If you never have tried Kind healthy grains products the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds would be a good one to try. The Kind line is all natural with nothing artificial. This is basically an all-natural granola, that you can eat right out of the bag, with yogurt or as a cereal with milk. This particular selection includes five whole grains, so your getting lots of fiber. Just beware that a single serving size is only 1/3 cup, so this is not a low-calorie food if you eat a lot of it. For those on low-sodium diets, this is for you, as one serving only has 20 mg of sodium. The blueberry taste comes through nicely, and my only reservation is for my personal taste the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters is a tad too sweet for my taste. I wish they would use less sweeteners, for we, after all, can always add more sugar if we want to make it sweeter. That's the reason I give the product 4 rather than 5 stars.

Another characteristic of this cereal worth noting--the wholesome taste of the whole grain blend really comes through.<br /><br />I like to put cereal with fruit and yogurt. The nice this about this product is that it stays crunchy in milk or yogurt. So if crunch is something you like in your cereal, this one is a real keeper.

review/summary: Great with milk or mixed into a yogurt
review/text: With only 5 grams of sugar per serving, it isn't the greatest eaten alone, but it isn't bad. The small and loose nature of the product makes it difficult to just eat plain as well. If I were going for something I could eat out of the bag as a snack, this won't be a top choice but is an OK option.<br /><br />It does make a good "cereal" when mixed with milk, albeit very expensive for that purpose. I found its best niche in our household is mixed with yogurt. We are trying to get our kids a wider variety in their diets and this stuff sprinkled in yougurt is a great way for us to do that. The bag is tough enough to allow you to break up bigger clusters with you hands so that it sprinkles in easily. My 7 year old son likes to eat them plain as well.<br /><br />The ingredients as listed are excellent and the product is labeled as being gluten free. There are 11 serving per 11 ounce package and each has only 5 grams of sugar. It has a good amount of fiber (5 grams) and some protein (3 grams). Labeled as having 750mg of Omega 3, which likely comes from the ground flax seeds.<br /><br />Pricewise it is at the higher end of the spectrum but not neccesarily way out of line with what you might find a similar product for in a grocery store. Just for comparison purposes I did pick up another like product (vanilla almond crunch with ground flax seeds labeled under the brand "Bear Naked") at the local Wal-mart. It was about 60% the cost of this product. Very similar overall specs although more reliant on oats. I did find the taste of the unmixed KIND product better and think it has a slightly more varied ingredient list with the Amaranth and Quinoa. But in yogurt the taste advantage was not noticeable. Both to me are fine for what our nutritional needs are.<br /><br />Overall this is a good tasting healthy product, that allows us to get our kids some better things into their meals then box cereals.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: Vanilla Blueberry Oat Clusters is listed as a healthy food which it is, however, it is also a delicious food.  When you open the package the light aroma of vanilla and blueberries float out of the bag greeting your appetite with a hearty good morning. The flakes are mixture of whole grains from oats, amaranth, quinoa, millet and buckwheat.  This is an excellent tasting combination.  Each grain tends to bring out the best in its companion grain giving the product a well rounded flavor without any noticeable sharp, unsavory flavors.<br /><br />Because Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry clusters is composed of whole grains it is naturally high in protective antioxidants and fiber which help protect against cancer, heart disease and diabetes.<br /><br />Linus Pauling Institute at University of Oregon on whole grains:<br /><br />"Epidemiological studies have found that diets rich in whole grains are associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes compared to diets high in refined grains."<br /><br />"Numerous case-control studies have found inverse associations between various measures of whole-grain intake and cancer risk."<br /><br />Harvard School of Public Health:<br /><br />"Eating whole instead of refined grains substantially lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels. Any of these changes would be expected to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. In the Harvard-based Nurses' Health Study, women who ate 2 to 3 servings of whole-grain products (mostly bread and breakfast cereals) each day were 30 percent less likely to have a heart attack or die from heart disease over a 10-year period than women who ate less than 1 serving per week. (1) A recent meta-analysis of seven major studies showed that cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, or the need for a procedure to bypass or open a clogged artery) was 21 percent less likely in people who ate 2.5 or more servings of whole-grain foods a day compared with those who ate less than 2 servings a week."<br /><br />"In a study of more than 160,000 women whose health and dietary habits were followed for up to 18 years, those who averaged 2 to 3 servings of whole grains a day were 30 percent less likely to have developed type 2 diabetes than those who rarely ate whole grains. (3) When the researchers combined these results with those of several other large studies, they found that eating an extra 2 servings of whole grains a day decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 21 percent."<br /><br />Finally, Vanilla Blueberry Oat Clusters also contains flax seeds which are a natural vegetarian source of Omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />From WebMD<br /><br />"There are many health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids. Research shows strong evidence that the omega-3s can boost heart health and lower triglycerides. And there are studies showing that omega-3 fatty acids may help with other conditions -- rheumatoid arthritis, depression, and many more."

review/summary: Not up to par.
review/text: I absolutely love Kind products, and I have been buying them for my family for a few years now. I was so excited to try this vanilla blueberry granola and give my family something healthy and delicious for breakfast. It's healthy... unfortunately it is not very delicious. Hardly any blueberries, the vanilla flavor is so subtle that it's almost non-existent, and the the flax seed flavor is so overwhelming that it makes the granola taste stale. I will say that my mother in law really loved the flavor, so maybe it's just my kids and I that didn't like it, which is why i'm giving it three instead of two stars.

review/summary: Healthy snack!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I did not expect to get a bag this huge! At $16 for 3 of these bags is a really great price!<br /><br />I LOVE granola and I especially love vanilla granola. A good amount of clusters are in this bag, that's always a good thing and I love how it has omega-3 in it! The blueberries are very flavorful but... I don't taste vanilla in this product at all.<br /><br />This is a great snack to have open during a movie or (like me and my husband) while you're online/playing a video game to munch on. It's a pretty decent tasting snack and it's healthy for you!<br /><br />Now I'm curious about that Dark Chocolate & Cranberry one...

review/summary: Eat Like a Woodland Creature
review/text: This package was delivered to my house and my housemate said it sounded like I had received something crunchy. I figured that was probably the Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds. I'm assuming when Amazon ships this out they put it in a box. Mine arrived (via Amazon's Vine Program) in a padded envelope. Therefore the "clusters" were mostly declustered. The result was a bag of loose granola, a few blueberries, and a lot of healthy dust. Kind prides itself on the slogan "Ingredients you can see and pronounce" and I think they live up to that. I'm not a health food connoisseur or anything but the contents of the bag looked pretty natural, like something a squirrel might find while out foraging. I was hoping to be able to take this to work with me to use as a snack but the loose and dusty nature of it proved too overwhelming to use outside of a controlled environment. Snacking on it at home was okay. It has a good taste, a good crunch, and it doesn't come in a can. Nothing mind blowing. What probably sets this apart from other things like it is the stylish package design and the simplicity of the ingredients. Later I felt wildly adventurous (and hungry) and tried eating it like cereal (which is one of the three powerful suggestions on the back of the bag) with soy milk. This was really good. Much better than the giant bag of store brand knock off Froot Loops I'm used to eating as cereal. Tasty, filling, and hearty. No violent sugar rages. I liked this and would definitely eat more but it's not anything I'm going to keep in the house on a regular basis.

review/text: I received a package of Kind's vanilla blueberry clusters with flax seeds via the Vine program and am glad I did. The ingredients are all healthy and the taste is pleasant.  It is suggested on the package that you can eat on the go, over yogurt or with milk.  I enjoyed mine on the go. Enjoy it your way but do give Kind healthy grains a try.

review/summary: Eatable.....
review/text: I'm not a big flax seed fan.  I know that you should eat some, but they're frankly bland.  Kind's Healthy Grains aren't too bad.  The grain is crunchy and the cinnamon gives it some flavor.  To be honest, I would have liked a bit more since the flavor tends to wash away with milk.  I normally eat it as a breakfast cereal and was also disappointed that there aren't as may 'clusters' as I would have expected.  It seems like most of the clusters in my bag fell apart and I was left with loose oats and flax seed.  I tended to eat this as a breakfast cereal and got about four average bowls out of one bag.<br /><br />Overall, I suppose its healthier for me and wasn't too bad to munch on in the morning.  I did put a bit of the mix into a bowl of oatmeal once and thought it was pretty tasty.  If I have to eat flax seeds, this is as good a way as any.

review/summary: It's Decent...
review/text: First off, let me describe my situation and usage of this product.  I'm usually stuck at work all day with nothing to eat except trail mix and nuts.  You can imagine that this gets old after awhile, so I was quite eager to try out these oat clusters (or granola, as the rest of the world calls it) to get some variety into my lunch diets.<br /><br />I'll just say right off the bat that I didn't pay much attention to how "healthy" this supposedly is because I'm primarily interested in taste, but it is indeed pretty healthy for this sort of snack.  I bet you're all wondering what this actually tastes like?  Well, for being a granola snack, it's decent.  I do wish that the cinnamon flavor was slightly stronger, and I kind of wish it was a bit sweeter.  Also, the flax flavor really comes out and it causes a sort of unpleasant aftertaste.  Overall, though, it's decent and I found it edible.  I do wish there were more clusters and less crumbly powder mess though.<br /><br />I should mention that the price is a bit on the high side.  For something that is essentially nothing but granola (and thus nothing new) you could probably buy granola much cheaper elsewhere.  I guess whether or not you want to buy this will depend mostly on your own personal preference (like the taste over other granolas, like the packaging, etc.), but I probably won't be getting any more of this item.

review/summary: Tasty low fat expensive granola
review/text: Although it is called "clusters," this product is basically granola, so it's easier to eat with yogurt or milk than alone as a snack. The cinnamon flavor is pronounced and pleasant. There is a nice combinations of grains, and it is lowfat, which is not typical for granola. I think the price is too high, particularly for a product that is not organic.

review/summary: Too good, it's dangerous
review/text: I had to throw my bag of Cinnamon Oat Clusters out after eating 3/4 of it in two days. TWO DAYS. The guilt of eating this much hasn't caught up with me yet.<br /><br />Yes, this granola is like crack. Yes, you will eat way more than one serving size. No, you should not just grab handfuls of this stuff out of the bag like I did if you care about how much you consume. Measure it people. I suggest, if you're tracking your calories like I am, to avoid entering how much you consume, because the numbers will only depress you if the carb monster in you comes out to play. My carb monster--and sweet tooth monster--both came out to play whenever I even SAW the bag lol. Today, I had about 1.5k calories from this granola--and that is not including the milk I consumed half of it with.<br /><br />Kind Snacks are awesome, and I am addicted to their Nut Delight Kind Bars. I have one every day I'm on my university's campus with a yogurt, and it is a filling snack/meal that keeps me satisfied for at least 3-5 hours.<br /><br />These grains are healthy, and what snacks should be like. Love that there's flax in here, and quinoa, millet, etc. They're great on yogurt, in some skim milk, and even better when eating them out of your hand. They're a little on the sweet side (it's 6g of sugar for 1/3 cup), so if you're trying to cut sugar out of your diet, I would suggest avoiding. Then again, they're sweet for me because I haven't really had sugary things in a while, so this was like a huge treat that I totally abused.<br /><br />The nice part is that there is plenty of fiber and omega 3's in this snack, so your blood sugar levels won't spike. The fiber in this also leaves you feeling full. But hey, being full never stopped someone from binging on a yummy carbalicious snack every now and then--especially when you haven't consumed many carbs in a while--so approach with caution... and your measuring cups!

review/summary: GOOD TASTE, TEXTURE NEEDS WORK
review/text: I like Kind bars and have been eating them for years, and was excited to try the granola.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed upon opening the bag was the texture- it ranged from fine powder to 3 chunks that were about 2x2 inches- too large to comfortably fit in my mouth.<br />Most of it was small flakes- not clusters. I prefer my granola in cluster form, as I usually  eat it by hand as a snack, not out of a bowl.<br /><br />The taste is good- a more pronounced cinnamon taste, even for a cinnamon cereal. With the first  few bites I really noticed the flax seeds, which I don't dislike, but don't love either. After the frist bites I did not notice them.<br /><br />Then, I tried this in a  bowl with milk. This cereal tastes phenomenal with almond milk!<br /><br />Good taste , crunch, and  lots of fiber make this a good granola, but I didn't like the wildly varying texture. If they got the texture more consistent, I'd buy it.

review/summary: fresh, crunchy and tasty
review/text: The cinnamon oat clusters are fresh, crunchy, with just enough sweetness to enjoy eating by the handful. The oat clusters do not have that typical oily taste that you get from other granola makers. Instead you get a clean tasting and healthy treat. Low in sodium and sugar, and best of all no saturated or trans fat! Highly recommend!
