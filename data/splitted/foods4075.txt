review/text: Love the full-bodied flavor of this coffee!  I figure if you can see through your coffee at all, it's not strong enough, but then I am prone to that in most things. This coffee is smooth, rich, and ready to rock, which suits me fine first thing in the morning (lark, not owl).

If you love coffee as much as I do and enjoy a very bold flavor then this is the cup for you!  I have already ordered a box for a neighbor that loved it as well and placed an order for a 2nd box for myself!

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: My original review was 1 star because I believe that I got a bad batch. I kept trying it and finally it started tasting good. It is the strongest K Kup on the market. With every other bold-strong coffee that I used to buy, I needed to use the 4oz setting on my Keurig or else it would be too weak. With this brand I can use the middle setting  (8oz) and it is still strong enough for me. Actually this saves money. Be warned, if you do not like strong coffee you will need to use the highest level on your Keurig or you will think it is too strong. If you want the strongest, this is the one you need to get.

Maybe a bit pricey, $8 for $10 tablets?  Its my first time buying electrolyte stuff, so I can't compare the price to anything.

It doesn't really taste like cherry, and much less like bubblegum than I'd thought. I haven't tried it yet with peanut butter and that may help hide some of its medicinal taste.

review/summary: Not tastey
review/text: I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.

review/text: I have two cats and both of them were a little overweight.  I fed them science diet 'light' for quite a while before the 'indoor' came out.  Does not seem to be much difference between the 'light' and 'indoor' except for 'indoor' is a little more expensive (same price but less food).<br /><br />The claimed hairball control does not seem to work.  My mid-hair cat still occasionally has hairball problem and I have to give him other stuff to ease that.  Nutrition wise, I don't know.  I did not switch back to the 'light' just because its name (for indoor cat), but I think essentially they are the same thing.

review/text: House Blend from Starbucks is a good, balanced medium roast coffee. When the "default" blend--Pike Roast was introduced several years ago, I was stunned to find that HB was not the usual coffee served at their locations. While I do not believe that Pike was introduced to compete with Dunkin Donuts coffee, the switch to Pike has made me a customer of Starbucks competitors. When traveling thru Chicago O'Hare on United, I head for the MacDonalds since both Starbucks locations in the United concourses serve Pike. A good example of corporate bungling. Howard Schultz should get rid of Pike (or at least serve HB as an option.

review/summary: Top Shelf Ginger Ale
review/text: I love ginger ale, and this Blenheim's is by far the best I've tasted. It's dryer than other sodas, so there's no cloying sweetness; the ginger flavor is complex/multi-layered, and while this particular level of "hotness" will make you cough, if you breathe in right when you take a drink, I wouldn't describe it as challengingly spicy. If you're familiar with this soda, and are considering ordering this pack of 12 bottles from Amazon, the bottles we received had gold caps (not red, as in the item photo). This is the medium hotness level for this brand. Cheers!

review/text: I am so excited to see that Amazon carries Blenhiem. Unfortunately its not available anywhere in SW Florida and the only time I could get it was when driving up or down the east coast and happened to pass through the Carolina's. I always hit "South of the Border" just to pick up some Hot Ginger Ale.<br /><br />I tend to drink sugar free soda's only but for this guilty pleasure I will take the extra calories with a smile.<br /><br />They do make a diet version and while it is still quite good it doesn't even compare to the Red Cap.<br /><br />Anthony

review/summary: Makes great rice
review/text: I have tried several other brands but I really like this one. First, the taste is right.  Not too sweet, not too sour.  Second, the powder formula makes for stickier rice. Some of the liquid brands make the rice balls for nigiri fall apart.  The bad thing is that if you get some up your nose, it stings and makes your eyes water. (I realize that a typical person does not generally inhale sushinoko intentionally, but it is hard to avoid when you open the packet and sprinkle it on rice!) I see that it says to use the whole packet for 4 cups of rice- I think this measurement is for uncooked rice.  You can season to taste, which is what I did the first couple times, but I find that it has a strong flavor when the rice is hot and it gets a lot weaker after it cools, so it was kind of bland unless I followed the directions.<br /><br />Sometimes when I am really lazy, I just make minute rice and put some of this on instead of bouillon, salt, soy, or other flavoring. Weird? Maybe. But delicious.

review/summary: Oooh, goodie, it's still around!
review/text: A college roommate turned me on to Keemun black tea.  She gave me a small tin of it and it was the best tasting tea I've ever had, full flavored and without any hint of bitterness, and with an appealing orangish color.  I always drank it sparingly, steeping it repeatedly - not knowing if I would be able to replace it when it ran out.  I've subsequently bought other tins of Keemun or "China Black" tea, but none of them compared to the one my friend gave me.<br /><br />Well, I finally drank the last of it last week (let's not mention how many decades it's been, shall we?).  I went online looking for sources for Keemun, bought some, got it, and it wasn't the same.  Had a smokey aftertaste that I understand is common with Keemun, but that I personally don't care for.  So, on a whim, I took a look at the can and found a label that said "Packed for American Roland Food Corp" on it.  Googled, and what do you know - the company still exists, and they show a tin that looks exactly like mine on their web site.  But they don't include it in their online store.  But Amazon has it.  I'm going to order some and see if it's really the same.<br /><br />Cross fingers!

review/summary: For those who like savory flavors, a real treat on toast
review/text: This tiny jar of concentrated yeast extract is quite the breakfast food. To use Marmite, spread it thinly on toast or sandwich bread. Wait! What do you mean by "thinly?" I mean, practically thin enough to be  a monolayer of molecules, because if you spread it any thicker, it will taste pretty strong. Well, actually, I use a quarter of a teaspoon on each piece of toast, which is buttered first to lubricate the process. And wait, how would one spread it thinly on fresh, untoasted AMERICAN bread without it tearing the fluffy crumb into tiny balls only suitable for feeding the koi? Again, a bit of softened butter, then a schmear of Marmite, a slice of tomato and you have a super tea sandwich. This is often my dinner, when I want something light.<br /><br />How and why was Marmite invented, and how did it become a beloved British traditional food, right up there with hedgehog-flavoured potato crisps? Back in 1902, some genius took the lees of good old British Ale, that is to say, Brewer's Yeast, and boiled it down to a tarry, black substance that no one in their right mind would eat unless their Mum forced them to. Because of the B-complex, Marmite became popular as a supplement for prisoners-of-war, served in hospitals, schools, to troops in WWI and WWII. It almost was rationed in WWII, with mothers told to spread it "very thinly, for now."<br /><br />Traditionally, Marmite is served on sandwiches and especially on toast at breakfast on toast "soldiers" or triangles of toast that kids can dip into their boiled eggs. The flavor is meaty, salty, though it has less salt than the butter you might use with it, and it has no meat or animal product--it's made of yeast so is vegetarian-vegan.<br /><br />The flavor, frankly, takes some getting used to if you don't like strong, savory things. However, if you like savory, meaty flavors and want something non-sugary sweet on  your breakfast toast, Marmite is fantastic. The closest I can describe the flavor is on the order of soy sauce, beef bouillion or mushroom pate. Other uses for Marmite are to flavor soups, meat or vegetable loaves, and stews, as a mix in dips or on bread for sandwiches and canapes.<br /><br />4 grams or about 1/8 ounce of Marmite has the following B vitamins:<br /><br />Riboflavin  0.28mg (17.5% RDA)<br />Niacin  5.4mg (35.6% RDA)<br />Folic Acid  100ug (50.0% RDA)<br />Vitamin B12  0.5ug (60.0% RDA)

review/summary: Secret Pleasure  &  Nutritional Powerhouse
review/text: My first culinary memory involves a surreptitious finger dip into the Marmite jar at the age of three; it is the first food I remember really loving. And ever since then I have had difficulty getting enough of it.  Not everyone reacts to it the same way.  Some imagine it looks too much like axle grease.  Others complain that it smells too much like beer left overnight  to go bad.  These facts suggest that one might only serve it to close friends and only when there are some alternatives. In any case, the Marmite claim "Love it or Hate it"  is quite apropos.  It rarely evokes a neutral reaction.<br /><br />The best preparation I can think of is to mix it thoroughly with butter.  One part Marmite to two or three parts butter.  Then spread thinly on toast.  Served this way, the primary flavor of Marmite is salt.  Then there is a subtle meaty flavor sometimes called umami - it's a flavor that is present in well browned mushrooms or red meat.  The label suggests that it might be put to excellent use in soup stocks as a  substitute or supplement to caramelized roasted vegetables - onions and carrots.<br /><br />As for nutritional value, even spread thinly it is dynamite.  Those who fall hopelessly for its charms may find themselves consuming mega-doses of a few crucial B vitamins.  It is an exceptionally rich source of B12, folicin, and B6.  And since it is free of animal products it is an ideal food to include in a Vegan diet which normally falls short in delivering B12.

Well - not that entirely different maybe. But, to my mind, Marmite is far superior. It tastes 'meatier', is a glorious glossy brown/black colour, comes in a much nicer jar and makes a lovely drink. 1 teaspoon in a mug of hot water in which you dunk thick slices of buttered bread. Lived on this when a poor student.

review/summary: First time user experience.
review/text: Someone recommended me Marmite as a healthy addition to morning meals. I read the reviews here at Amazon and I was very hesitant to order because there was a general consensus that it requires an 'adquired taste'. After months of debating I went ahead this week and ordered it.<br /><br />I did what many reviewers recommended and spread butter on a slice of bread first and then spread a micro thin layer of Marmite (the butter was supposed to mellow the strong flavor and help spread the thick marmite). I spread about a pea sized amount of marmite in one slice of bread and 3 peas sized amount in another slice.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the smell, it smelled like beef buillon. Like very strong beef stock. The first thing I could taste when I put it in my mouth was SOY SAUCE and SALT. The taste was a combination of beef stock with vinegar and soy sauce. Not very plesant. The vinegar part was very potent and I could feel the roof of my mouth feeling a bit raw (sort of like when you eat a lot fo sauerkraut or pickles and the roof of your motuh feels 'scraped'). I think the micro amount I had spread on the first slice was not enough for me to taste the secondary flavors and so I only got the kick of the strongest flavor, which was not very plesant and sort of bitter.<br /><br />The second slice was just as potent as the first one but I could appreciate underlying flavors. Did I mentioned this thing is salty? Oh, it is salty. At the very end of each bite there was a really good nutty aftertaste. Its very difficult to explain the combination of flavors, but it is definetly a strong meaty essence with equally strong seasonings.<br /><br />The 'adquired taste' I guess comes from that bitter soy sauce/vinegar salty kick that is hard to ignore if you are new to the spread. Even a tiny drop of marmite will fill your mouth with taste. But overall, I consider it to be an interesting (good) flavor. Great for a quick snack. The fact that is jam-packed with healthy stuff (Folic acid, B12 vitamin, Niacin...ect) makes it a keeper in my pantry. I think I will experiment eating it wih cheese or a slice of tomato like another reviewer adviced.

review/summary: THIS is what I am constantly craving!
review/text: I was first given this treat on a trip through England when the B&B owner offered me some for my breakfast.  She had a sly grin on her face, and now I know she was expecting me to react like most Yanks do, but she and I were both surprised.  A tiny dab of this stuff on the corner of a piece of toast was sheer heaven to me.  I felt a sense of wellbeing spreading from my mouth throughout my body.  I know that sounds a bit extreme, but that's really how it felt!<br /><br />All my life I've craved savory flavors and have been drawn to foods such as red meat (preferably scorched on the outside), tomatoes, mushrooms, and dark green vegetables - I'll take one saltine cracker over a  handful of cookies any day of the week.  Well, come to find out, Marmite is high in the "fifth flavor" umami, and that's what I'm always trying to find in my food.  It's "that flavor I'm looking for" distilled down into a little brown jar.  Mind you, it's strong stuff; a little dab will satisfy all your red meat cravings (though it contains not one spec of any animal product) but more than a dab is really just 'way too strong, even for a savory-food-lover like me.  Spread it THIN!  It's great spread nearly transparently over toast or crackers, and a couple of drops will make any insipid canned broth lot more hearty.<br /><br />Caution: if you own a cat, make sure to wash your hands after eating Marmite.  Apparently they go for it, too, and will try very enthusiastically to remove your fingers and run away with them if any trace is remaining on your hands!

review/summary: It is a cultural thing
review/text: For those of us brought up on Vegemite, Marmite doesn't make the grade.  For those brought up on Marmite, Vegemite seems a poor substitute.  For Americans who only seem to put sweet stuff on their cake (oops, I mean "bread") both are revolting.<br /><br />I think that a major reason why Americans abhor these savoury spreads is that being used to spreading honey and jam on their breakfast toast, they tend to use like quantities of Vegemite or Marmite.  To uninitiated the taste of either spread applied so lavishly is going to be overwhelming.  Before passing judgment on these spreads, you would do well to heed the advice of "Joanna" or "mtspace" and apply thinly. It also works best with very fresh bread or hot toast.<br /><br />Incidentally, I believe that Marmite was first.  Vegemite was an Australian imitation created several years later.  It was originally called Parwill - a pun which will be appreciated by Aussies and Brits but which may not be understood by Americans because of the way the words are pronounced.<br /><br />I only give Marmite four stars.  That probably tells you my upbringing.

review/text: I went to UK for the first time a couple of years back. My friends introduced me to Marmite as something some people enjoyed when they couldn't afford eggs and bacon. The Mr said it was made from a by-product of beer, I thought he was joking at first.  Spread it thinly on a piece of dry toast, served properly, he demonstrated then handed to me. It was surprisingly strong but I liked it. Savory [or savoury as they would spell it] like bacon or other cooked meats but none of the awful fat or grease. It's not terribly hard to find here since the advent of shopping with the wonderful world wide web, so I have been able to enjoy this in the US as a snack between meals on one slice of whole wheat bread, often a late night sandwich with room temperature cheese and tomato.

review/text: I just wanted to start by responding to some of the claims made here. Firstly, you do not need to be a particular nationality or type of person to like Marmite. That's just ridiculous. Secondly, it is not a "cultural thing" to enjoy savory or "umami" foods, any more than it is cultural to like sweet, sour, bitter, or salty flavors. You either like it or you don't. Does everyone like double fudge ice cream? Incredibly, no. I find Marmite delicious, but potent. I think many times people don't enjoy it because they've eaten a gob straight from the jar or they spread it like jam. That's too much! Try it spread very thinly or add a SMALL dollop to your savory sauces and stocks. I highly recommend trying it. You may love it. If not, at least admit it's a matter of preference rather than rant like a xenophobic donkey's rump.

review/summary: A Yankee's take on a British staple
review/text: Having lived in the US all of my life (although I have traveled quite a bit) I had never heard of Marmite until last week. I've been participating in an on-line, UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising. As we discussed products that we grew up with and are still loyal to Marmite came up several times. I looked at some Marmite ads (the British call them "adverts"), and then searched for it on Amazon. Being a dedicated foodie I decided to give it a shot. Here is my impression:<br /><br />When I first opened the glass jar and gave it a whiff it seemed oddly familiar. I put just a dab on my spoon and tasted it straight. Again, strangely familiar. The taste was very strong, almost condensed. I could taste the beer-like yeast but I was also getting a savory, deep vegetable flavor. Then it hit me.<br /><br />I love to make sauces and I often use pre-made glaces and demi-glaces which have a very thick consistency when gently heated (before heating they are almost solid). They come in many different varieties: beef; duck; veal; chicken; lamb; seafood; mushroom; vegetable; etc. Marmite has a strong resemblance to a straight, undiluted, vegetable glace. Pungent, earthy and with that quality that the Japanese refer to as "Umami". WOW! Who knew? Well, I guess a lot of people did but it was new to me. Now, what to do with it...<br /><br />My on-line British friends gave me some sage advice: use it sparingly and on some sort of bread with butter. I bought some fresh English Muffin bread from a local artisan bakery shop, lightly toasted it, coated it thinly with about 2/3 teaspoon of Marmite and spread some salted Vermont cultured butter onto it. HEAVEN! The Marmite balanced out the heaviness of the butter perfectly. That gave me the inspiration for my next test. I've alway loved a toasted bagel with cream cheese or Marscapone but need something to cut the palate-coating fat of the cheese besides a slice of onion (lox works well if you have it). Marmite fit the bill technically, but I think that I will have to get used to the combination. Still, I will keep using it here for a while and I think that it might become a favorite for me.<br /><br />Next I tried it in a simple sauce. I browned a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (who am I kidding? I used 2 tablespoons of butter). After the shallots were browned I added 3 tablespoons of Marite and 1 teaspoon of water. I reduced it a little and added 1/3 cup of heavy cream, a small bouquet garnet in cheesecloth and 1 tablespoon of dry sherry. I reduced it by about half and adjusted the strength by adding more Marmite (I needed more, maybe I should have used less cream). When finished it tasted really good, not great but it could certainly WOW most people. Put this on fish, chicken, turkey, or any light meat or veggie and it works.<br /><br />Marmite has an advertising campaign that tells people that they will either love it or hate it. I am definitely in the love camp.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5XV2">More Than Gourmet Classic Roastd Vegetable Demi-Glace, 1.5-Ounces (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010OQP90">More Than Gourmet Veggie-stock Gold; Vegetable Stock, 16-Ounce Packages</a>

review/text: Although not for everyone (many people seem almost allergic to the stuff), I'm very fond of it - having been raised eating it.  For those who can appreciate the strange flavor, it's a very good spread (preferrable to vegemite in my opinion).  But definitely approach with caution, as it's something of an acquired taste.

review/summary: Marmite Yeast Extract Spread
review/text: Although I did not purchase from Amazon yet but will shortly, I too lived in Australia for some years and loved Marmite on toast, Yum ! practically lived on this stuff, I've had Vegemite as well but don't like it, some people like Marmite and some don't whereas others prefer Vegemite, so it is really difficult to recommend one or the other, it's really what your taste can handle, I can tell you though it is a little bitter, some people are even put off of Marmite by the smell, suggest using this spread very thinly, first time users should just use a thin spot on a very small piece of Toast until you derive a taste for Marmite, oh but when you do you won't be able to get enough of this stuff, ate lots of this MARMITE as a kid and loved it and you know how kids are when it comes to certain bitter tasting foods.

review/summary: Love  it or hate it
review/text: My husband and I are both American and were visiting a British friend who thought it would be funny to introduce us to "Marmite."  Well, as a teenager int he 80's, I'd been exposed to Men At Work, so anything that looks like THAT and ends in "mite" is suspect to me.  Now, the Aussies have Vegemite and the Brits have Marmite--each says his is superior.  We are NOT talking about chocolate, here, remember.  So, much to the surprise and disappointment of our friend, my husbands eyes lit up and said, "Oh My GOD, what IS THAT? I LOVE IT"  So, being the nice wife I tend to be--I went looking for it and of course, only found it online.

review/summary: Toothsome condiment, absurdly overpriced.
review/text: This substance is quite a bit like Vegemite (one reviewer here makes a point that it's not: I'm not sure he tasted both, otherwise why make such an obviously absurd statement? Vegemite is a tad smoother, but that's all).<br /><br />The consistency and colour are a bit like chocolate mousse but much thicker. It is a bit softer than Vegemite though. The predominant flavour is salty, with a noticeable aftertaste of bitter, and a hint of smoke and beer. Ignore the promotions that suggest it's a spread: it is most certainly not a spread -- if you spread it on a slice of bread like jam or butter, you'll vomit: it's too bitter in such a huge quantity. Better do this: spread some nice butter on your bread, generous amount, and then add no more than quarter teaspoon of this thing. You don't have to spread it: me, I just scoop it from the bottle and eat. Take a bite out of your bread, and then 1/4 tsp of Marmite directly off the spoon. Or you can try to spread it, but it's thicker than butter and it'll be hard to smother it evenly over butter, it'll clump and remain in one place (too much of it). A small amount does it, don't gorge, it's a strong flavour. It also works great with zesty greens, like arugula, for example. Well, there isn't much else to say: it's great stuff, and I can heartily recommend it.<br /><br />Don't listen too much to the talk of its being an "acquired taste", only for the Brits, etc. It's a normal condiment that all people will like, I believe. Which brings me to one very significant moment: it's absurdly overpriced. I would put it in the same category as, say, soy sauce, or salsa, and it should cost about the same too.<br /><br />Btw, don't get it here, get it locally: it's a bit more expensive but there's no shipping, so the overall cost will be much lower. I get it in Whole Foods, for the obscene seven/forty-nine a small jar (but it's less than overall here though), or, when they have it (not always), at Wegman's, for the less-unreasonable four/ninety-nine. Good stuff, but needs to be much cheaper, when will Unilever come to their senses? I think a fair price for Marmite would be like, say, three dollars for 250 grams (and it shouldn't be sold in such small jars either: 250 grams is the smallest that'd make sense, 'cause like it is, I finish it off, alone, in less than two days and have to go buy another jar). In my view, Marmite should come in 250 gram, half a kilo, and a kilo packages -- and cost a fraction of what it costs right now. It's even more expensive than Vegemite (who is available at Wegman's, for about six bucks at the time of posting). These two similar products are quite agreeable, but six to eight bucks a tiny jar is way too much, it's an insolence really. I can't give good rating to this product in view of these prices, therefore: product itself is five stars; prices one star: our overall rating here is therefore three stars.

review/summary: "LOVE IT or HATE IT"
review/text: After three days of marmite-binging, I now undertand why the Marmite slogan is "Love it or hate it". I live in the USA and people here don't eat toast unless it has some kind of sugary/corn-syrupy stuff on it. I hate the idea of eating toast with anything sweet except honey. So, I am out of choices in here....or so I thought. I discovered marmite because of one of my classmates who is from England. She likes it so much that she sleeps with a jar right next to her. If it were a man, she swears she'd have babies with it. Tempted by her passion, I went straight ahead to Wegmans (fyi best grocery store on planet earth) and bought a jar. I spread some butter on my toast and then a very(VERY) thin layer of marmite on top. The first bite did not leave a very pleasant taste in my mouth. However, a few bites later I was craving for more. It tastes like a mix of mushrooms(the non-magical kind), molasses, malt, tamarind, licorice, and jaggery. My friend on the other hand had to drink a whole can of juice(booze) to get rid of the taste in her mouth.<br /><br />Apparently, even in minute portions, it's very high in vitamin B12 and folic acid which is a good thing. The jar looks very British, with the no-frills label and the vintage yellow cap. I am going to use it for storing honey or spices when im done with the marmite. Dark glass jars keep spices fragrant longer.

review/text: Rooibos tea has been used for centuries in South Africa.  Not only does it taste really great, it is also good to help induce sleep AND it works to help calm an aching stomach and abdomen.  Whenever me or my kids complain of that good ole *stomach ache*, I immediately brew them a cup.  You can also reuse the Kcup a second time, and even a third though the third will be a little weak, making this a great bargain.  Off topic of the Rooibos, the mint tea can also be used twice in the machine with very little difference in taste.  Both can be used on the largest setting with no loss of taste.  I highly recommend this tea both for it's lovely unique taste AND its medicinal properties.  Enjoy!

I started out with the Bigelow Asian Pear Rooibos and loved it but thought I would take one for the team and try this one too. To my taste, this is less sweet, less woody and more earthly - I prefer the Bigelow but this might be a better choice for black tea drinkers.

I like the flavor, it is a medium-bodied tea with a little bit of bite.  It won't replace my Earl Grey but when I want a flavorful cup of tea without the buzz this is a good choice (I brew it using the smallest cup size on my Keurig B70 about 5oz.).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2L8">Celestial Seasonings K-cups Sleepytime Herbal Tea, 24-count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>

review/summary: A Great Tea for a Change of Pace
review/text: Rooibos tea is definitely a departure from the mundane taste of black tea.  It has a much different, though still very pleasant, taste than one might initially expect.  It also has a very unique aroma and serves as an excellent complement to any good meal.  The fact that it is naturally free of caffeine also means that it is great as an evening tea to calm the nerves and avoid the energy rush of caffeine-containing teas that could lead to difficulty getting to sleep.  I must also say that, like other k-cup tea varieties, it is also well balanced and tastes similar to tea prepared in the customary manner.  Overall, this is a very drinkable and, through the use of a k-cup, very convenient tea for seasoned tea drinkers and newcomers alike.

review/text: The African Rooibos tea worked well for the Keurig coffee machine. Some teas tend to taste burnt because the machine makes the water too hot for green or black tea, but this red tea almost always came out nice. It is also pleasant to drink at any time since it is naturally caffeine free. And of course the single serving k-cups with the machine makes the experience so much more convenient than brewing a whole pot of tea for one person.

review/text: Love it. The flavor, hmm.... I do not have the exact words to describe it. I like a strong flavor coffee, and this has a nice strong flavor. I also find green and herbal teas soothing, and the rooibos has that also. It's not coffee, and it's not tea, but it does have some of the characteristics of both. No caffiene, so when I want a coffee late in the afternoon or in the evening, then this is my go to drink.<br /><br />If you're keurig machine has different size options, I usually go with the 10oz size. I found 12oz too weak. I never tried the smaller size options, so I do not know how strong it will be with the smaller sizes.<br /><br />It does stain your cup. But, I once read that if it doesn't stain, then you're not drinking authentic rooibos tea.<br /><br />I will buy again.

The creamer was made with the dates, coconut milk and vanilla bean paste and I have to say my coffee will never be the same again in a good way. I also made a syrup to add to other hot drinks as well, which turned out so good, makes a great replacement for sugar and better for you. I am not a real sweets or candy person, but these dates will be what I reach for when a craving does hit. I will keep looking for new recipes to try as it seems anything you use sugar for can be replaced by these dates if you are limiting refined sugar intake. I will continue to buy these as long as the price does not creep up as this is a good buy for the price.

review/summary: great flavor
review/text: This is a very well flavored curry.  The aroma is exceptional.  Add more or less to control spice intensity.  I usually add additional pepper sauce to spike the heat.

review/summary: Lacks Coffee and Hazelnut Flavors
review/text: This is the worst coffee I have ever tasted. The process which extracts the acid has also extracted most of the hazelnut flavor. It tastes like a decaffinated, freeze dried, instant coffee with little or no coffee flavor. You cannot alter the flavor with milk or sugar. It maintains it's awful taste forever. The sad thing is we have 5 pounds of brown powder which is going in the trash. It's just awful.

review/text: Buy Spinach & Roasted Garlic Crackers if a teaspoon of salt in every cracker appeals to you.  The cracker doesn't even make the current list of what the company offers.

review/summary: Cardboard Taste
review/text: Got these from my local store hoping it will be tasty and rich in flavor. But they are very card board like with very little veggie taste in every bite. I am not buying them again.
