review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: The price + being organic is what drew me in to try the Stash brand... but the taste is nowhere near the Jasmine tea that I can get at my local teashop.<br /><br />I have tried several different ways of brewing, and the sweet jasmine aroma & taste is barely discernible.<br /><br />It is drinkable though, and like I said, the price was very good.  I hope to try the Numi brand next -- I have heard rave reviews about their Jasmine Pearl teas!

review/summary: Not really an Earl Grey tea
review/text: This tea is spiced with other spices than bergamont and while the tea seems of good quality its taste it unlike an Earl Grey.  It tastes almost sweet and more like an herbal than a black tea.  If you are looking for an Earl Grey, this certainly is not it.

review/summary: Very strong...
review/text: This is my first bag of chai tea and I have to say, it's extremely strong if you try to drink this straight. I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.

review/summary: Bitter Grass Clippings
review/text: I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea "leaves" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/summary: Daughter's first choice
review/text: My adult daughter is "into" saving the planet, tigers, water resources, trees, etc. She chose this chai tea after discovering an old tea infuser in the kitchen drawer thinking it would be grand to make tea "the old fashioned way".  She realized with the first brewed cup that loose tea has a much fresher, intense flavor than teas in a bag. I doubt that she will go back to using tea bags again and will probably research and request more Stash tea products in the future.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a "premium" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.

review/summary: Go for Pinhead Gunpowder instead...
review/text: Having purchased a package of this tea and one of Stash's Pinhead Gunpowder Green, I can safely say that the Gunpowder is much better tea. The "Organic Premium" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.

review/summary: Very Bergamot-y Tea!
review/text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****

review/text: I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.

It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.

review/summary: High quality, organic!, a little flat
review/text: I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.

review/text: I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.  I like a fairly strong tea and usually grate fresh frozen ginger into my tea cup for extra flavor.  I steep a generous teaspoon of the loose leaves in 8 oz. of hot water (not quite boiling).  To my delight, the Jasmine green tea is always good with or without ginger.  I can use the leaves at least twice with good results.  The mild aroma of the tea is like jasmine blossoms and the taste has a sublte sweetness.  I drink at least 24 oz. of the tea each day.  So the fact that the tea is organic is a plus. The price is competitive.  I will buy this tea again

I can brew it, put it in my travel mug, go to the gym and an hour and a half later it still tastes great!  Can't beat the value either at about $5 a bag.  If I recall correctly it is about $7 at the Stash store in Oregon.  This is the tea that got me drinking green tea!

review/text: This has become my favorite Stash tea.  I liked the Earl Grey, but the Double Bergamot Earl Grey is twice as good!  As to whether or not it tastes like 'real' Earl Grey, who's to say?  They're all a little different.  But if you like Earl Grey, this is DEFINITELY worth a try.

To those who do not regularly use loose tea, the tea bag (Teebeutel, sachet) definitely does not taste as crisp and refreshing as the comparable tea when brewed as loose tea.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice beautiful loose leaf jasmine tea. Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania.

I love this tea, but their suggestion of one teaspoon is a bit conservative for black tea you usually do one tablespoon per cup not a teaspoon, its up to preference but i love this tea and the fact that it reminds me of camping is a plus! it makes me feel good, and it tastes great too!

review/text: I am not a real connoisseur of loose teas, but I do like decent black tea with no added flavors, just loose black tea like indian or ceylon teas or maybe some blends like irish or english breakfast. This is a perfect example - relatively inexpensive but good tasting with full, rich flavor. Perfect for someone who would not settle for teabags, but is also not into exquisite expensive teas.

review/summary: Jasmine Green Tea.
review/text: Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx

review/text: I recently started drinking loose tea instead of bags. I was buying the jars from my health food store, but they are pretty expensive. I am always looking for a better deal, so when I found these on Amazon, I decided to get them. I gave one to my mom, and one to my brother. I kept one for myself and I think it is going to last me awhile. Since I don't know all that much about teas, I can't comment much on the quality but as far as I know it is good! It seems comparable to the same stuff I got in the smaller jars. Recommend :)

review/text: I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it.

review/summary: Bitter aftertaste
review/text: I love good teas -- and this is my second disappointment with Stash in the last few weeks.<br /><br />If you brew this as directed the tea leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.  I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!

review/summary: Doesn't taste like English Breakfast to me.
review/text: I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect.

review/summary: Fantastic cup of coffee!
review/text: This is my favorite of all the CBTL regular coffee capsules! It is a nice dark roast with a very smooth finish. I have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SH6UTG">Kaldi S04 Single Cup Brewer, Red</a> and the machine really extracts all the flavor for a perfect cup of coffee. No bitterness! I often froth milk with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SH6V1I">CBTL LM-145P Milk Frother, Black</a> and add one of the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Vanilla Powder sachet packets and have my morning cup of coffee at home! If I'm in a hurry I just use my special creamer (I love the International Delight Coffee Creamer, Caramel Macchiato, 24 Ct (Pack of 4) and it's every bit as good without taking as much time.<br /><br />The capsules are designed for the CBTL single-cup machines and the patented system ensures that the coffee stays fresh until the brewing process. At about 60� each (Amazon has it in their subscription program as well which lowers the price a little), you get specialty coffee house brew at much more economical prices. You can also order the capsules directly from the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf company for the same price. I hope they will have this product in my local grocery soon!

review/text: I used to hate coffee. Now the more I drink, I'm wanting a little bolder flavor. This French brew is on the bold side, yet very smooth and I don't notice any bitterness at all. The aroma when it's brewing in the machine reminds me of the wonderful aroma on a plane when the flight attendants first turn the coffeemakers on. This flavor seems to have a tiny bit of chocolatey flavor at the finish just like the Viennese CBTL. The more I drink this one, the more it tastes LIKE the Viennese but bolder.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O5XB9Y">CBTL Viennese Brew Coffee Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10-Count Box (Pack of 3)</a>.

review/text: Tetley decaffeinated greet tea is the best tasting tea I have found. When I ordered it on amazon through their subscription program, they sent ONE box of tea, not a pack of six.  For $22+ that was very expensive tea.  They refilled the order and again only one box of tea was sent.  I'm not comfortable trying to order it again.  I look forward to hearing of other people who placed their orders and did receive a pack of 6 boxes of tea for this order.  Amazon refunded my purchase price and let me keep the two boxes of tea by the way.  The only reason I gave this one star was because of the order fulfillmet problems.  Amazon is terrific and Tetley tea is the best. Phyllis @ Gr8FindsOnline

review/summary: fat-free AND next-best thing to sodium free!
review/text: Broths or stocks have become ubiquitous in homestyle cooking, but many of us want to limit fat and sodium.  Fat-free broths such as this one are widely available, thank goodness (and you can make almost any broth fat-free yourself, just by chilling it, removing the top of the container, and discarding the fat which will have risen to the top).<br /><br />But it's pretty hard to find decent low-sodium broths, partly because it's cheaper for food companies to add salt than to flavor their product any other way.  Swanson's used to have fat-free, sodium-free broths that I swore by, but I literally can't find them anymore.<br /><br />This is the next best thing.  Both this and the chicken version let you drastically cut back on the salt in what is, let's face it, the most voluminous ingredient in most of your cooking.<br /><br />Since studies suggest that average Americans eat at least twice the safe amount of sodium each day, and since high sodium intake is associated with high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and other health issues, these 50%-reduced-sodium broths can make a big difference for all of us.  Way to go!!  Now, if only we could get the sodium free versions??!!  :)

review/summary: Taste like Caramel?!
review/text: My favorite, sodium-free, organic beef broth only comes in cans so I switched back to Swanson's. What a mistake. First of all, this brand has 440mg of sodium per cup (compared to 130mg for the organic brand) but it still has lots of extra ingredients to make up for the the 50% sodium that's removed. I had a hard time finding a list of ingredients before I purchased so I'll make it easy for you.<br /><br />Ingredients: Beef Stock.<br />Contains less than 2% of the following: Yeast Extract, MSG, Caramel Color, Maltodextrin, Glycerine, Onion Juice Concentrate, Beef Extract, Flavoring, Gum Arabic, Disodium Inosinate, Sodium Guanylate, Triglycerides, Vegetable Oil, Xanthan Gum, Soy Lecithin.<br /><br />I never thought I'd say MSG WASN'T the worst thing about a food product, but in this case it's not. This broth is terribly watered down and the dominate taste is CARAMEL, not beef. I don't remember having this problem with Swanson's broth several years ago. All I can suggest is that you taste a plain, heated cup of this stuff before you buy a dozen and put it in your cooking. I found it gives an odd, dark and bitter taste to my dishes. Bon Appetit!

review/text: If the cookies had been edible I might have given more stars for this item. They were a bit fuzzy like the title says. And the smell was offending. They smelled of mold and crumbled. Besides you only get a handful and they are about quarter size or smaller. But the cups are awesome. I did not expect them to be so thick and heavy. The straw is also made of heavy acrylic. I am sure they will last if properly cared for. The only downer is they are so heavy they actually look like and feel like glass so I am not sure if they will break or crack if dropped.

review/summary: My 12-year old son LOVES this stuff.
review/text: I don't think it looks or smells particularly appealing, and I have not tasted it. My son, however, thinks it's darn near the best stuff in the world.<br /><br />After he had some at a friend's house and came home raving about it, I (reluctantly) bought a box for his use as an after-school snack. According to him, it's the kind of quick food that staves off after-school hunger so severe that it will actually kill a 12-year old boy if he doesn't counteract it by eating something the second he arrives home. (After all, dinner is still a couple hours away; FAR too long to save a hungry, growing boy from complete starvation.)<br /><br />At his request, I bought him a box of Cheeseburger Mac Hamburger Helper Microwave Singles at our local grocery store. A few weeks later I went back, intending to purchase more. Unfortunately, they were out. I asked a store clerk when they would have it back in stock and was told that *that* product would no longer be carried. None of the flavors. We have two grocery stores in our town; I checked the other grocery store with the same result.<br /><br />Odd. Unfortunate. I suspect that this may prove to be one of those products that just don't make it, for some reason.<br /><br />Too bad. It's great kid-quick food, food that they can make themselves, food they will eat and not toy with before tossing away, and food that actually has a modicum of food value to it instead of a load of completely empty calories.<br /><br />So I'm going online to buy up a bunch of this product before disappears completely.
