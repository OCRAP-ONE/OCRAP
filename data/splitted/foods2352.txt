review/summary: Tastes weird , doesn't mix, but I think it's healthy!
review/text: Let me start by saying that I usually use Whey protein.  I decided to try the hemp protein as an alternative.  The bag arrived just as the picture shows with not much other packaging and it was a decent deal when compared to local store hemp protein.  That said, I don't know if all hemp proteins must taste like this one, but it was very difficult to get down.  I usually make a morning smoothie that consists of protein, blueberries, strawberries, soy milk, and cocoa.  Even with the fruit/cocoa in my smoothie the hemp protein taste dominates. And it is very unpleasant. On top of that, it doesn't mix well and therefore gives the smoothie a terrible gritty texture.  For me, unfortunately because of the taste and texture, I will have to stick with whey protein.

review/summary: It Is What It Is
review/text: Get this if you want a pure gluten free source of protein. This is a great source of protein that doesn't contain any fluff to make it taste sweet. So don't get this if you're looking for something sweet and tasty. But seriously, if your protein mix tastes like mint, strawberry, or cookie dough, you have to wonder what they're putting in it.<br /><br />I don't care for the taste very much (like I don't care for the taste of avocado or tomato), but I take it because of it's health benefits.<br /><br />EDIT: Mix 4 tbs of the protein with approx. 5 fresh strawberries and it tastes marvelous! It has to be fresh and not frozen. A fresh cup of blueberries or one banana tastes pretty good too, but so far, the strawberries are the most tasty.

review/summary: Cookin with Hemp
review/text: As far as I can tell this is high quality HeMp. The taste is very bland with a hint of nuttiness. The texture is not gritty, more like really small powdery flakes and it doesn't dissolve in liquids. Finally it will turn what ever you put it in greenish brown, so you can't hide it in light colored foods. Don't use it for protein shakes.<br /><br />The best uses I've found for it are to put it in foods where it will stay suspended and it can complement the flavor. My favorite is to add it to homemade granola and date bars. Another suggestion would be adding it to eggs for "green eggs and ham" or add it to baked goods like muffins or cake.<br /><br />It takes to heat well and I haven't burned it yet.

review/summary: Good stuff.
review/text: I've been dealing with a lot of muscle soreness from trying to get back into mountain biking and being out of shape.  I decided to try protein-infused smoothies to help combat this, fairly leery of how much they might actually help.  To my surprise (well, I guess not too much surprise given the number of positive reviews), this hemp protein works extremely well.  It tastes pretty good, and has enabled me to bike almost every day.  Best of all, it feels pretty lean, definitely preferable to the fat-laden bars and such out there!

review/summary: Nice product
review/text: I have been purchasing this at the specialty store.  I really like this product, but it's probably not for everybody's taste. One has to get used to the rough, earthy, powerful taste. Based on that, it contains plenty of fiber, is relatively high in protein and easy to use. Being an organic raw protein food helps too with its value. I sometimes mix it in with my cereal or blend it into a protein drink. It's much healthier than the protein shakes, which are usually full of sugar or contain artificial sweeteners that are believed to cause BRAIN TUMORS, and I use it on a daily basis.

review/summary: Great Deal, But Tastes Like Earth
review/text: This protein mixes well with water, but it's kind of gritty. It tastes absolutely horrible if it's not mixed with either another powder or some type of liquid other than water. I add a scoop of this protein and a scoop of a chocolate rice protein. I usually make the shakes in water, but I occasionally add rice or almond milk to top it off. Overall, this is a great deal. Just be prepared to have some type of mixture ready. Water alone won't mask the taste of dirt.

review/summary: Healthy choice....if you can handle the taste
review/text: I read through the reviews and decided to give the hemp protein a try because I liked how it has both high protein and high fiber. Thus far I've found the taste to be really difficult to handle, maybe a dirt/saw dust kind of mix. I did experiment with it a little and found it works really nicely with hot chocolate where you want a little bit more of a grainy taste. Overall the hemp protein is okay and I'll definitely finish the 3 pounds I have, but don't expect to buy this again.<br /><br />Edit: To follow up on my initial review, I'm still using the hemp protein with hot chocolate. I'm not big on shakes since they bring back bad memories from when I broke my jaw and couldn't eat solid food (and thus had a lifetimes worth of shakes), but I've also started adding it to apple juice and orange juice, which still tastes great!

review/summary: Tastes like sand and settles to the bottom like sand.
review/text: So I have terrible anxiety and stress issues. My friends are always telling me I should smoke weed lol. However, I'm not a smoker and I'm a professional so that option isn't available to me. I decided to try some hemp products to see if they helped any.<br /><br />This hemp protein is a big NO from me. What I have been doing is adding it into my protein shakes. I add a scoop of protein and a scoop of the hemp, then blend it with milk in my Magic Bullet.<br /><br />The problem with this stuff in shakes is that it has the consistency of sand. Literally, it tastes like sand in your mouth. Also, immediately after I make a shake, I mean immediately, all the hemp sinks to the bottom. So I end up drinking the shake and by the time I'm done there's a quarter inch of hemp-sand at the bottom of my cup with very little ingested by me. I have to literally spoon it out or pour water in, shake it up, then drink it real quick.<br /><br />So this product was a waste for me. No way would I ever buy this again. It is terrible in shakes. Maybe if someone wanted to add it to their food or add it to something they are baking, like cookies or brownies, it could possibly work but it's of no use to me. Also, the first product I tried was hemp oil vitamins and they really gave me a boost in my spirits and with more energy. With this stuff, I feel I'm not getting any of the benefits like I did with the vitamins. This stuff was a waste of money for me. I will use this bag and that's it.<br /><br />Also, the packaging is terrible. After you cut open the bag, you basically have to put it into a container. I used a pitcher lol. They should at least make the bag resealable with with a zip-lock.<br /><br />If you want to try a great supplement form of hemp for health reasons, I would recommend these which worked immediately:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00119TL2W">Hemp Seed Oil 1000mg - 60 - Capsule</a>

review/summary: This CAN  taste like dirt - unless you are creative in your power drink
review/text: I bought this for my pregnant wife who is trying to consume more protein. We both tried it and it tastes like dirt. We were both a bit confused as to how it could be considered any other way. I mean, we haven't tasted dirt, but this is what we imagine it would taste like. It is not palatable - in our book. Unfortunately the vast bulk of the 3 lbs of " dirt" have been sitting in our fridge - until we find SOME way or SOMETHING we can use it with.<br />I know some find it tasteless,or even "nutty?", but we tried it with fruit and other amendments, and for us, it blots out the other flavors. So we can't use it in protein drinks. Of course, given all the positive reviews, everyone has different impressions. But we just had to chime in for the "dirt" choir.<br /><br />1/31/11<br /><br />Thanks to a reply by "Delia" to my above comment, we have made some changes to our drink. Delia suggested not putting 4 Tablespoons in right off, but to work up to it. She also suggested using various ingredients to mask the flavor until we acclimate. Well, it appears to be working. So this stuff - if taken right off that bat just mixed into a smoothie may be a bit harsh for some folks - as it was for us. But using Delia's suggestions - it does appear that we can use this powder after all. Look in the comments to this review for details. As a consequence of Delia's kind comments, I've changed my rating from one star to 3 and added this new comment to my original review.<br /><br />  Peace

review/summary: Extremely beneficial raw plant matter
review/text: I got this at the recommendation of my friend, kind of an impulse buy.  Its excellent, I highly recommend it, when you receive it it looks like a typical forest/camo green--not the off-brown in the photo.  I put the powder, about 4 tablespoons, in fruit (and veggie) smoothies--equates to 11 grams protein I believe and a ton of other very good things that it does for you, both known to our young human science, and, probably not known to our science yet either.  This is a plant, when you study it, that has been around humans in their places of evolution and settlement for thousands of years, and yes I am speaking of this plant alone, not including its sister plant of the psychotropic affecting variety.<br /><br />It has a nice nutty flavor, its absolutely superb in terms of its nutritional capacity.  Its like quinoa is to grains--the highest in protein content among the grains--its nearly the king.  Simply put this stuff is the bomb, you could put this stuff in virtually anything, for any dish, or beverage, and it would make that end result concoction super fortified to use a made up term.<br /><br />What I do most mornings, with a regular chunka breakfast type food is make one of these hemp smoothies: is get a bag of frozen fruit (costco has a great one): shave some of that stuff off, add 4 or more tblspoons of this powder, put in a some fresh fruit or veggies (or whatever), and then add some liquid (filtered water, organic soy milk, etc.) for the liquid portion, put it in blender, blend it for 3-4 minutes on low first, then high; when dundee, croccodile style you've just made a simple but great nutritional drink & source of nutrition.  This according to the same friend is a pretty amazing price too--although I cannot say one way or the other myself.  Lastly, please check out the most amazing spiritual preparation on I've ever found, or any of the materials by author Marshall Vian Summers, I can vouch for this, it is the real deal.  Follow it and see, its called Steps to Knowledge, the Book of Inner Knowing, it was Spiritual Book of the Year for 2000 as awarded by Foreward Magazine.

review/text: I bought a 3lb bag of this stuff understanding that there would probably be a considerable difference in taste from protein powders that use artificial sweeteners.  I am three weeks in to using the stuff on a daily basis, and, unfortunately, the taste is still horrible.  It tastes like chalk and the consistency does not allow it to completely dissolve, so you sometimes will get powder balls popping in your mouth when downing a shake.  I've tried blending mixed fruits, adding cinnamon, adding honey, adding brown sugar... no luck.  The problem is you have to add so much sweetener to counter the bad taste, that you defeat the purpose of making a healthy shake.  My search for a non artificially flavored protein continues...

review/summary: GREAT Taste!
review/text: Have never been a big meat-eater, but cut back even more a few months ago.  I began supplementing my diet with more beans/legumes, but was not feeling nutritionally satisfied, and realized I was not getting enough protein.  Did a little research, and discovered that hemp was ideal for meeting protein requirements, and according several articles I read, it has many other nutritional and health benefits as well.  I purchased the Nutiva hemp protein powder in conjunction with the Better Than Milk "Rice" (to avoid over use of soy).  According to directions for both products, I mix 4 tablespoons hemp protein and 2 tablespoons of  BTM, in water.  It mixes easily in a regular plastic shaker, and I don't even have to use the "de-clumping" attachment that fits inside the shaker. It's just Shake-N-Go! This combination has been the perfect way to start my day.  I was concerned about the taste, as some reviews I have read rated the taste of hemp very low. I can't speak for other brands, but the finely ground Nutiva hemp powder has a mild nutty flavor, and I LOVE IT. From what I've read, hemp does not contain oligosaccharides (which commonly causes "gastric distress" with soy proteins), and I have not experienced any bloating with the hemp and rice milk combo. I am happy to start my day with something both nutritious and delicious, and thank goodness I don't have to use the electric blender (one less thing to wash).  Also, the Amazon price on the Nutiva Hemp Protein and the Better Than Milk Rice can't be beat, and both qualify for free shipping.  FANTASTIC!!!

review/summary: SuperFood!!
review/text: SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO GET HEMP POWDER AND HEMP SEEDS MIXED UP. THEY ARE BOTH GREAT PRODUCTS, PUT THE POWDER IS WHAT YOU WANT FOR SMOOTHIES AND SUCH. THE HEMP SEEDS ARE FOR SPRINKLING ON SALADS AND SUCH!!!!  This is a great product, have used every day for last 3 years. Since it is raw and in it's natural state, you body has to do "no work" to process and digest it, thus that energy is used to do other things (like staw awake at work). Yes the amount of protein is 11 grams per serving, but since it is raw and in its natural state, the body will assimilate more of it that many protein sources with 2 or 3 times as much protein. The more nutrition in any food, the less your body needs to be happy. I do about 20 grams per serving since I'm near 200 pounds. But forget about the concept of grams of protein per serving, think more in terms of how much of a protein your body can process and assimilate from the protein source. I have proved this theory by eating a chicken breast one day, and drinking a hump smoothie at the same time another day and noticing that after the chicken I get hungrier faster, which implies the chicken has less nutrients in it. 50 grams of beef or chicken will not give your body as much protein as hemp. One point to remember is hemp is not something you can mix with water or milk by itself and expect a good taste. It has a muddy and mirky look and taste and an un-appealing green color it. However my smoothies are great because I add frozen banana, gives it an "Ice creamy taste", frozen blueberries (turns my smoothies an appealing grape-purple color) and strawberries, cacao nibs, and also instead of water, I always keep some cold herbal fruit flavored tea in the fridge and use that, gives it a fruity taste that permeates the smoothie. Very often they are so good, I smack my lips wanna go make another. Jamba Juice ain't got nothin' on me! Don't mean to get long-winded, but this is one of the healthiest foods in the world, and when you eat healthy, get great physicals, and never feel tired, you wanna spread the word with so much mis-information out here. By the by, been using for 3 years everyday and have passed to 2 drug tests for 2 jobs.<br /><br />Oh and I have to respond to another reviewer named "Not Me" on his comments in relation to mine pertaining to "Chicken vs. Hemp". We both gave the product 5 stars but had some disagreement on the best protein. He threw out a lot info on the components of protein, but I am very in tune with my body, and I can say for sure that a hemp base smoothie gives my body type more nutrition than a chicken breast and I get positive energy effects after my smoothie and not the dropp-off like after I eat meat. I'm not saying hemp has the best amino acid profile, so I supplement my protein intake daily from other sources, especially organic free range eggs. He mentions soy as a great protein, but he is not aware that excessive soy is bad for women, and the benefits of soy is mainly in fermented soy products. So, I guess we can go back and forth, but my review was for the person who is trying to get started in finding better products, that person is probably not at the point of analyzing the amino acid profile of a smoothie. I'll say again that I know for fact through experience and experimentation that a hemp based smoothie gives me more nutrition that chicken of beef. Not sure how a stranger on the web can tell me it doesn't. But we are all trying to learn, and I am experimenting with supplementing my Hemp protein with Brazil Nut protein and some others, BUT DEFINITELY NOT WHEY OR SOY. There are many opinions in health just as in politics and sports, the key get is to just get started, enjoy researching products, enjoy positive effects of good products, get in tune with yourself, and your body will tell you what is right or wrong.

review/summary: Nutrition/protein considerations using hemps
review/text: Another reviewer comments on 50g of chicken/beef vs. hemp being a better protein serving.<br /><br />For poop and chuckles, 50 grams of chicken breast contains 14.5 grams of the chicken's protein. Then, he is right; he is ingesting more protein if he eats hemp with 20 grams. But due to the high quality of the chicken (roasted) breast at 136, I'd much rather get that 14.5 grams of chicken protein if my health depended upon it, instead of the 20 grams of hemp protein.<br /><br />!!! hemp protein is very weak in lysine and somewhat in tryptophan (according to the amino acid data Nutiva, this manufacturer, provides on their website after it is studied more than their presentation allows at face value -since it lists numbers but not human optimal requirements), only 55% of the ideal ratio of lysine to overall protein if I did this back of the envelope calc correctly, and both of these two essential amino acids are lacking.  That would give it around a protein quality of 55 when we are looking for over 100 in that measure. Normally protein quality is nothing to worry about since randomly several sources are combined and usually work out well.  But some people seem to really push their protein intake very high for bulking up, etc., and others, usually not healthy are trying to supplement their needs to meet their numbers.  In both of those cases protein quality will make or break their strategy.  That is not to say they need to have complete proteins each time they eat: Only; they need to approximate optimal human essential amino acid proportions basically over a day or so.<br /><br />Chicken, on the other hand, has a protein quality score of 136, almost reaching egg whites (145), and exceeding, soy and most other proteins, making it a much better quality protein - and he is correct in not getting caught up in the "grams". Then, there was a PhD student commenting on bioavailability of hemp protein and plant protein in general. He also is right and hemp's nutritional value can be overestimated by not looking at this. A good assumption for veggies is about 80% BV for veggie products compared to chicken, so that makes hemp worse than the 55 ...<br /><br />All the above said, hemp is great, you just need to quantify what you are getting and tailor it to your needs. The feeling of being "full" has nothing to do with the quantity of protein as the other reviewer claimed he felt. As a matter of fact, fresh veggies are low in protein and people eat them to feel full - old dieting trick.<br /><br />SUGGESTION: The bottom line is if you are in need of protein supplementation, be careful with counting on large amounts of hemp if you haven't complemented the relatively "low protein quality" with other "low quality" proteins to get the correct mix for optimal diet needs... it would be critical to add 100g of frozen spinach and a cob of corn or its equivalent in kernels to get the additional lysine and tryptophan per serving of hemp - it would be a reasonable vegetable source if you go the vegetarian route.<br /><br />But, hemp protein still has other amino acids below 100, so you are improving the two weakest points with a nutrient dense food like spinach to balance it out. I haven't checked the rest - and now it is time to say "eat a well balanced diet". Yogurt or whey protein will take care of that - combining it with hemp protein content 1:1; soy somewhat if you are vegan - but be careful of not overdoing it for your thyroid hormone with soy ... find some extracted with alcohol if this is the case since the pseudo hormones are diminished in the  alcohol extraction. Don't ask me where to buy it but it is out there.<br /><br />Soy is great in moderation and offers better quality than hemp. As for eating too much protein in general, this can be a problem, too if you get supplemented out, especially if the amino acid profile is not a good match for optimal nutrition conveniently found in meat, dairy and soy proteins. The excess amino acids are disposed of by stressing the liver in extreme cases (somewhere over 1.2 grams protein per pound of body weight depending on the strength of your liver). So, if you eat an average protein quality of 55 and get your daily grams, you will actually only get let's estimate something of the order of 55% of that protein incorporated into you (ok, there is a bit more to it depending on the non-essentials, but this is the general idea) and the rest will be dumped into your liver, excreted and converted into energy. The excretion part will be in the form of urea. Too much urea in the urine puts you at risk for gout a disease you don't want to know about.<br /><br />So, best to eat a serving of spinach and cob of corn with a 30 gram serving of this hemp, beans and Swiss chard would be helpful, but really a well balanced diet including dairy is the healthy low risk situation keeping a general eye on fats but no dwelling on it to the point of worrying about gaining an ounce of weight every now and then ... that's why we need to exercise. People who are immobile have other issues and the bioavailability, supplementation and protein quality are very important. Like for preventing skin breakdown and bed sores to start with. Depends on your situation.<br /><br />As a final note ... this hemp protein extract 50% powder (be sure to understand when you order which you are getting) goes better with smoothies unless you like eating a woody taste, but still has lots of fiber so just hope you acquire the taste.  Hope this helps...<br /><br />*This makes sense if that reviewer is comparing it to his 20 grams content of protein (40g hemp powder) of whatever he serves himself. If so (and it seems that way from the ambiguous talk of grams, serving size and exactly what is being measured), he is comparing 20 grams of hemp protein to the protein content in a 50 gram portion of chicken breast (who knows - maybe he means 50 grams chicken protein which would be a lot more chicken breast to eat and lots more protein).

review/summary: Effective protein & Fiber, though not versatile
review/text: When I first opened the bag, I was thrown off by the strong aroma, somewhat reminiscent of sage. However, this aroma died down within a couple of days.<br /><br />As I mixed it for the first time, I noticed it didn't dissolve very well in water, and the taste was a bit strong for my liking. However, as with the smell, the taste became milder as I got used to it. I now enjoy it very much.<br /><br />As for its inability to dissolve in water, I find that the best solution is to add water and make a paste. Then, I drink the water off the top and eat the paste with a spoon.<br /><br />Regarding its effectiveness, this product keeps my digestive track regular and gives my muscles the protein I need for work. (I work in construction, with a little heavy lifting and a lot of movement.)<br /><br />I am very pleased with this product, and I will be purchasing it again!

review/summary: Great alternative to whey and  soy protein
review/text: After reading the reviews here I was a bit leary of this stuff, but the price on it was just too good to pass up, I figured it couldn't taste that much worse than whey. Since going vegan I've been looking for a replacement to whey, and I don't really want to use soy powder because my diet already has a lot of soy in it.<br /><br />The taste is fine, after seeing the reviews here I expected it to be god-awful, but it doesn't have much of a taste and isn't really noticeable. I mix it in a blender with ice, a banana, and some rice milk or soy milk or water and I barely even notice the taste at all. The only complaint I have is that the powder tends to sink to the bottom of the glass, so I have to stir it with a spoon a few times to make sure it stays mixed with the liquid.<br /><br />And the price is really great, definitely buy it from amazon.com if you can.

review/text: I mix it in smoothies and ice cream and have it every morning. In ice cream, I can't taste it at all. It does need some masking, not the best flavor, but grape juice and bananas work well, berries too. Feel very regular since I started using it. The price was great and it will last a long time, since I've followed the freezing/refrigeration instructions. I figure I can't go wrong with this fiber and protein source. It encourages me to eat more fruit, and I'm starting to blend in a few veggies too and you can't get enough of those! I even found recipes online for baking with this stuff and made oatmeal cookies that actually turned out good! I recommend it to anyone who wants more fiber in their diet and likes experimenting with new recipes for baking and blending drinks.

review/summary: The best alternative
review/text: There are a lot of technical reviews out there, but in very simple words, there are two things that you get from the hemp powder. First is the protein, it is very potent and actually keeps you active, there are lots of studies on the net that you can look up, but for myself, I have been using it for 1 year now, and I can run for 4 miles and pump weight for another 1 hour and still go out party in the night, I never had so much energy with any other product. The second part is the fiber, it will make your mornings lot easier, without another fiber supplement. For taste, it is very personal but, hemp is easy to mix in a wide variety of liquids so you have choices, the best idea is to try it for a month or so and see how it works on your body, make sure you exercise to maximize the result.

review/text: I've had all sorts of protein powder, whey, soy, rice. I can mix and chug anything. That said, this is the least mixable, least chuggable protein powder I've ever had to contend with.<br /><br />Essentially, this stuff mixes like sand and tastes like lawn clippings.<br /><br />I've got a blender bottle, I can mix any protein powder that comes at me, but the fact of the matter is that this powder settles to the bottom so fast that I have to chug the mix the instant after I'm done shaking, and there will still be a lot of grit stuck on the bottom. The grit coats my throat, and there is nothing I've found that will help the taste. I can handle it, but it's not as great as people make it out to be.<br /><br />That said, whilst calorie counting, this makes me feel satiated, and it does provide insane fiber to my diet. I'm sure using this stuff in a smoothie is infinitely better, where there are heavy flavors to mask the taste, and a thick suspension to stop the stuff from settling.

Also, adding a helping of flaxseed, chia seeds, and/or maca powder to the oatmeal can create a very healthy multi-grain oatmeal that will keep your energy levels high all day.

review/text: It has made a difference in the way I feel.  My skin seems softer, my fat is disappearing.  I used to have stomach cramps when I drank whey but with hemp, I do not have that side effect.  It tastes nutty and I even put it in my oatmeal every morning.  I am sure glad I came across this product.

review/summary: Protein powder per Excellence
review/text: Because of a medical condition I need to take a supplemental protein powder. There are many out there that are good...Whey Isolate, Soy Isolate, but hemp is all natural all vegan and much more easier on the digestive system than Soy protein.<br /><br />Because it doesn't contain the active THC, it will NOT show up on drug tests and it offers a complete protein with valuable Omega 3's and 6's as well as a host of other vitamins and benefits NOT found in Soy isolate or Whey Isolate.<br /><br />I use mine mixed in a smoothie with fresh fruit (Acai and frozen blueberries) and it gives me not only a great energy lift but an inner calmness and the fiber also helps the digestive tract without being to "heavy".  If you want to do something good for yourself you owe it to try this product. Warning...It WILL make smoothies a green color, but the taste is very mild and almost non-detectable if you add bananas, blueberries or strawberries. I highly recommend this product whether for good health or if you need (like me) extra protein in your diet.

I had used RAW PROTEIN before this which has a much more neutral flavor. The hemp protein tastes about how you would imagine dried fibrous plant would. Imagine blending a burlap sack or maybe  a jute rug. Thats about it.

review/summary: Best with Soy Milk
review/text: My spouse and I love this product as added to a nutrition shake with whey protein and soy milk. The taste & texture(of the fiber) is really hard to get over if used with dairy milk, its much like a dirt milk-shake; but you can improve it by adding something sweet and letting the hemp fiber soak into the milk for about 5 minutes then re-blending. However as long as you blend it well with soy milk, the tastes actually complement each other nicely, but it may still take some getting used to.<br />And I love the nutritional benefits of the daily fiber, its invaluable for people who don't have the time or the budget to get all the fiber they need in a day.

review/text: I like this product, but it's probably not for everybody. One has to get used to the earthy, overpowering taste. That being said, it contains plenty of fiber, is relatively high in protein and easy to use. Being an organic raw food helps too.<br />I mix it in with my cereal or blend it into a smoothie. It's much healthier than the protein shakes, which are usually full of sugar or contain artificial sweeteners, and I use it on a daily basis.

review/summary: A Great source of protein and fiber, ok taste, VERY gritty
review/text: This fiber and protein powder does not go down very smoothly- HOWEVER, the taste is not so bad, and goes away completely with a small glass of water (unlike some other natural alternatives that have a taste that seems to linger or stick to your mouth).<br />I would not actually recommend it for most smoothies, although cooked along with some steelcut or thick cut oatmeal it is palatable.<br />I've been taking one heaping tablespoon with breakfast, one before dinner, and one after workouts.  I mix it thoroughly with just about 4 or 6 oz of a low or no calorie drink and chug it. Then add enough water to rinse the cup out and drink that, too.<br />I was skeptical of the product, because so many high fiber and protein products seem to upset my stomach, but I have had no gas or other problems like I get from many of the other high fiber products I have tried, and I dare say that my recovery times after workouts seems a bit better since starting this regimen.<br />If you have a problem with gritty texture, try the same company's 50% Protein powder, as it is a bit smoother. Also, unless you are very accustomed to both high fiber products and "health food store" tastes and smells, I would recommend starting out slowly, gradually increasing the amount you use per serving.

review/summary: Healthy and a good addition to lots of meals
review/text: Hemp seeds have lots of good things going for them including lots of fiber, protein a high content of beneficial fatty acids and phytosterols and loads of other good things. I put a tbsp or so in my salads because of the health benefits, and there is no real flavor impact one way or another. These are pretty small (smaller than barley) and quite happily get lost in the mix of other foods tossed in with them.<br /><br />As a diabetic treating diabetes through diet and lifestyle changes, I no longer eat things like oatmeal, porridge and the like, but if you do, I am sure that adding these to those kinds of meals would be great.<br /><br />They are small but still have a nutty texture, so you can also put them on yogurts for a little texture without any strong flavor.<br /><br />I keep the bag re-sealed in the freezer and refrigerate a small container from which I take what I eat each day. They have kept fine for a long time in the freezer this way, and I have never had any problems with spoilage or rancidity.<br /><br />Rather than dislike them because they are bland in flavor, instead I recommend them highly as an addition to other meals for that very reason!<br /><br />NOTE: These are NOT a powder. They are small hulled seeds - much better than a powder - but if you want or require a powder, these are not a powder...

review/text: When I first tried this I was not a fan at all!  Since then it has sat in my freezer and I didn't want it to go to waste, so I decided to experiment a little with it.  I started by just adding 1 TBS to a smoothie and over the course of a week I'm happy to report that I've worked my way up to 4 TBS.  Now I have been craving this smoothie almost daily!  Mission accomplished!<br /><br />Chocolate hemp smoothie<br />1 C almond milk<br />1/2 frozen banana<br />1-4 TBS Hemp protein hi fiber<br />1 packet of stevia<br />1 TBS organic unsweetened cocoa powder<br />2 ice cubes<br /><br />Place all ingredients into blender and blend on high, until it is smooth & no chunks of ice can be heard rattling around.  Don't get me wrong, I still taste the hemp but blended this way it tastes good!  If you have never tried this and are not sure you will like the earthy flavor then purchase a smaller size!  The 3 pound bag will last a LONG time!<br /><br />I'm allergic to milk and therefore I can't have most protein powders, plus the labels are frightening!  This is made from 100% organic hemp that is all!  I can feel good about that!

I like to grind up nuts and seeds and mix with some herbs/spices as a healthy salad topping (great for a raw "Caesar" salad similar to finely grated Parmesan). My favorite blend is raw pumpkin seeds and raw almonds. Add in a scoop of this hempseed powder, with some good salt and garlic powder, and your salads will never be the same! Goes best with a simple dressing of olive oil and lemon juice. Ooo la la!

review/summary: Hemp protein
review/text: I needed more protein in my diet and more meat wasn't the answer. I checked out the different protein powders and the body builder's blogs turned me on to this. For the first few months, too much fiber wasn't cool, but that passed. Now it's OK. I guess I was getting enough fiber already, who knows. Anyway I use 3 table spoons of hemp protein, grapefruit juice, a whole banana, a handful of frozen blueberries, some strawberries, and at times, pineapple or an orange, or a kiwi fruit, even apple sauce. Yum, good stuff. Choke down your vitamins with that.<br />The down side is the clean up.<br /> Really, the raw organic veg protein is such a good fuel and as the body builder guys pointed out, it helps to alkaline your system too.

review/summary: How to really ENJOY your hempseed protein powder
review/text: Searching for healthy foods that will most benefit me and my family, I have found this hemp protein powder is a terrific boost for the body. I was having trouble finding ways to incorporate it into our meals, I am not a big smoothie drinker and I found the powder a bit difficult to bake with. THEN, I had a brainwave: put it into dips! I use cream cheese, kippered herring or other smoked fish, paprika, onion, celery seed, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, makes a truly flavorful dip, and you can put as much protein powder as you like in it, you will hardly notice it. Any spicy or well-seasoned side dish or dip is easy to enhance nutritionally with this natural, protein-rich powder. And for times when I can't eat  I put it into capsules for easy consumption. My sister is a diabetic and finds taking the capsules help her keep to her diet of several small meals every day. My husband will happily consume a hemp-boosted dip on his favorite corn chips, or take the capsules if he needs a mid-day power-up. Older family members who may be poor eaters can be sustained with the addition of protein powder to their diet as well, to improve their well-being and to help maintain cognitive function. When hot weather strikes (and it strikes hard, here in Texas) I find it difficult to eat much, but I can take some protein capsules and come on strong again.

review/text: If you've never tried any sort of protein supplement, this one might take some getting used to. The color isn't pretty, and it has a slight grainy texture to it; BUT, the flavor is subtle and quite nice.  There is a slight nuttiness to it, which I find compliments any fruit I want to turn into a smoothie.<br />Compare this protein to whey or soy, and odd color or not, this one wins hands down.  Whey protein makes me want to retch after the first sip!! :)<br />I love the extra protein and the 14 grams of fiber that each serving provides.  With all that fiber, this gives me a perfect breakfast smoothie or afternoon snack to keep me full and ward off the munchies.  Plus, with the omegas and amino acids in each serving, you don't get a much more "perfect" food that's still super convenient.<br />For Weight Watchers followers, one serving is only 2 points. (under the new program)<br />I like to mix mine with 1 cup of  frozen fruit and 1-1 1/2 cups flaxmilk (or your favorite milk).  Blend well and enjoy!!

review/summary: Very digestible, i like hemp protein
review/text: I really like this hemp protein, like A LOT !!!!!! I make a smoothie and it tastes good and a nutty flavor. I like how you can immediately digest it. I find this is cheaper than a lot of whey proteins. It is very healthy as it is plant based with tons of vitamins. I take 10 chlorella tablets as I am downing my smoothie . The blue/green, green algaes added to my diet have done wonders for my system, I love spirulina and chlorella daily for energy and cleansing, hemp protein just falls in line with a total healthy diet for the body in helping fight disease too. I have been interval training for 4 months now. I do a smoothie with spirulina, flaxseeds ground, hemp protein, coconut oil, banana, and a few frozen strawberries, comes out great. I would highly recommend hemp protein powder for working out, energy, to be regular, protein quickly to muscle after a good workout. I am very satisfied with the switch from whey protein to hemp protein.

I've made a couple smoothies with it so far and it's not unpleasant-tasting. It doesn't really taste "great" by itself (but you're probably not going to eat it by itself, are you?) but it's definitely in no way unpleasant. Another reviewer mentioned mixing it with rice milk, and I support the idea that mixing this hemp powder with a sweetened soy/rice/nut milk product would definitely be palatable, and a simple way to take this as a supplement.<br /><br />Not much else to say. It's a good product for a reasonable price, if you're into this sort of thing. Quality-wise I can easily recommend this Nutiva product. :)

review/summary: Vegan bodybuilder
review/text: I am a vegetarian, and lactose intolerant. I also work out a lot, and body build. This is one of my main sources of protein. It is a very complete protein, and easily digested, it shouldn't give you gas unless you've seriously been lacking fiber in your diet, in which case you should be drinking this stuff daily. It is one of the few proteins that has anti-oxidants in it because it is plant based. It also has healthy fats. The protein will stick with you, and it doesn't weigh you down or make you crash later, because it doesn't have crud like caffeine or sugar or animal fat in it.<br /><br />To the people who say it tastes bad.. so does every other protein mix if you don't blend fruit in with it. This stuff can actually be taken plain if you're so inclined, it's no worse than wheat grass or spinach, but do yourself a favor and throw a banana in with some sweetened soy milk (or cow milk if that's your drink of choice).<br /><br />The 3lb bag by nutivia is quality hemp protein, no different than stuff you get in the plastic canisters, other than its lower price.

review/text: I blend 4 tbsp of this, a cup of frozen berries and a cup of water and get the BEST smoothie.  If I am ambitious I add some cranberry concentrate and flax oil.  All the fiber keeps me from craving junk all day and I get fuller faster when I eat my lunch and dinner.<br />As for the taste, I really like the nuttiness it adds to the smoothie.  Most protein powders (especially soy) make me wretch, but this is great!

review/summary: good food
review/text: The flavor takes time getting used to, but the advantages over soy protein are huge, as well as over many other fiber-rich products. There are plenty of resources on the web and people need to get acquainted with unjustly ignored hemp products in our nutrition. If the flavor bothers you too much, the same company makes very good flavored shakes.<br /><br />Four stars only because of the flavor, otherwise great product.

review/summary: Does not dissolve, causes stomach problems
review/text: I have tried several brands/types of hemp protein powders and this is definitely the worst overall that I have experienced. The actual flavor of the powder is fine and has the expected seedy/chalky taste; however, this powder is more coarse than many others and is almost the size of fine sand pieces. Therefore the powder is unable to dissolve at all in any liquid you mix it with.<br /><br />I also felt strong stomach pains when drinking this product. No hemp proteins have caused this problem before so I think it is due to this product's poor quality. After this experience I plan on sticking with the "Manitoba Harvest Hemp Pro 70 Concentrated" powder as I have loved this product and had no digestive problems with it.

review/summary: Very good natural ingredient for protein smoothie+ good value
review/text: I'm not a health nut but trying to exercise more without resorting to synthetic protein more than the occasional nutrition bar.  At it's core, this tastes like rope with a slight nutty edge.  There is no way to expect this to resemble artificial products and yet it can be made quite edible in a smoothie with vanilla and other ingredients without adding a lot of fat.  My experiments reveal the worst thing to do is put blackberries in a smoothie.  So get Strawberry and Raspberry packs, the Blackberries have big seeds in them.  However, 4tbs of powder in one cup of water is not drinkable for me.<br />I've settled on this.<br />The chia is to conduct the protein as it has some fat.<br />You could also try almonds.<br /><br />6-10 ounces liquid;combination low-fat milk and water to desired thickness.<br />1 tbs chia seeds--pre-soak in liquid.<br />2tbs hemp powder<br />2 drops vanilla<br />1/2 cup frozen berries<br />2 tbs non-fat plain yogurt<br />Opt:1 teaspoon acacia powder<br />Opt:Natural non-cal sweetener<br />Very filling, keeps calories low and low cost compared to packaged.<br />Seriously about 100 smoothies for 50 cents each.  Good value.

review/text: I had used Nutiva shelled hemp seed in 5 lb bags, and rather liked that product.  I thought this protien powder would be a good way to get the same benefit from a less expensive product.<br /><br />The flavor of this powder is not nearly as good as the hemp seeds, and the texture is way to fibrous.  I'm going back to the seeds.

review/summary: Tastes Like Grass
review/text: I read the other reviews about the taste of this product being less than ideal but i shrugged if of as i was planning to use it in my brealfast along with oats. That first time i had a real eye opener. IT TASTES HORIBBLE at first. But since i ordered it i continued to use it in smaller doses.. went down to two spoons then three and stopped at 4 now. I have gotten accustomed to the taste somewhat but i cant see myself making a protein drink with this. I will have to put a lot of sweetener to make this platable which goes counter to trying to make a low calorie protein drink.<br /><br />Additionaly there is only about 11g of protein in 4 tablespoons so if u are a big person like me i wont be really getting enough of protein allotment from a serving of this stuff. I would no recommend increasing the serving size as there is quite a lot of fat per serving even though there are no sugars. And again the amount of sweetner needed to make it taste drinkable would cancel out the benefits.<br /><br />I also tried mixing it with another protein drink i have that tastes good as i felt that i could get the best of both worlds.. the fiber of this this product + the taste and high protein content of the other. It tastes ok but why waste money on two sets of protein. Just get a better product and eat more veges. I am sticking to my old product. Will never buy this again.

review/summary: Super healthy but tastes like ass
review/text: I have no idea what these people are thinking saying this stuff tastes great. They must work for Nutiva or have a friend who does.<br />This stuff is super healthy, I'm sure - but tastes friggin' awful. It's like cardboard pulp. I make smoothies with it which my mom said look like diarrhea.<br /><br />I'm stuck with this huge 3 lb bag - which, in its defense - is a fantastic bargain. But I got it in 2010 and I'm still trying to choke it down two years later. Spend the extra money and get yourself some Vega. It's certainly pricier, but you get what you pay for.

review/summary: Only OK
review/text: Like others here, I've tried many kinds of protein, whey, rice protein, etc. powders. I've also had all kinds of products that aren't exactly tasty but are health-supporting....a slew of green powders, various forms of Chinese medicine and tea, etc. Lots of those don't taste so good, and that's just the way things are.<br /><br />With a protein powder, a little pleasure is a good thing, since we're all after a shake-like taste. This one? Not so much. The good news is that it's vegan, all kinds of good for you, well priced, and mixes with a bit of effort but fairly well. Bad news: taste of this stuff. Just plain unpleasant.  I mix it with almond milk and what is probably a biologically dangerous amount of stevia. If you intend to use it along with other fruits, veg or add-ins it may be just great. But just to stir into milk (or substitute)? Maybe not.<br /><br />I'll finish it, but won't be ordering another.

Not delicious but not bad tasting either.<br /> * It settles quickly.  No big deal:  swish the container when you take a drink.<br /> * Be sure to rinse your container so that the dish washer can take care of the rest.<br /> * Don't use too much at once because it has a lot of fiber.

review/summary: Excellent taste but....
review/text: This product tastes great, as one reviewer said it has a mild nutty flavor which adds a nice flavor to my smoothie, it can be a little gritty depending on how many tablespoons you add, but that doesnt bother me. The reason i knocked it 2 stars is with the 16oz container, 3 tablespoons is 11 grams of protein, and their is only 15 servings per container! For somebody like me who works out everyday and drinks a protein shake directly after workout, this is not the size nor the product for you, go with the hemp protein without fiber and 50% protein compound <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JU81ZG">Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein 15G, 16 ounce canister</a> i recommend the 3lb bag,This 16 oz container might last me two weeks.
