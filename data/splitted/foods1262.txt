review/summary: Only Brand Allowed in the House
review/text: Excellent taste and made with real cheese...isn't that a novel concept.  If you don't believe that statement, check the information on the internet about the yellow food dye used by the major brand name.  That dye isn't even allowed in Europe...it is actually banned.  Once you read this information, you will never go back.  Annie's is excellent tasting and perfect for my family.  Only brand I would allow in my house given what I have learned. Perfect for those quick dinners at home.

review/text: I grew up with Kraft, and they make a good product beyond a doubt.  But this blows Kraft out of the water!  A little more expensive to be sure, but worth every penny especially to a Mac and Cheese addict like me.  The sauce is creamy and blends easily but has a nice sharp taste to it.  Tastes great and is all natural and (mostly) organic.  From a box it can't be beat.  Only thing better is Home-Made.

review/text: This product has the smaller shells.  I was expecting to see larger ones.  It was very easy to prepare.  For one meal I just threw in some leftover ham pieces amd sweet peppers then baked it in a casserole dish for about 20 minutes.  Another time I just made it per package instructions and served it as a side dish along with some baked fish. The cheese sauce tastes really good.  You can really taste the cheddar and it wasn't overly salty.

review/summary: Simply VILE!
review/text: I've never tasted jet fuel, but this mac n cheese is how I imagine it would taste.  The whole premise of Annie's Homegrown is that it is natural.  Let's face it; if it comes from a box it's not natural.  The cheese in a foil package is reminiscent of Velveeta.  If the kids (2 of the 3 like it) want it in a pinch great, but it's not crossing my lips EVER again.  And comparing it to Kraft, there's not much difference in the nutrition department.  Both Kraft and Annie's have similar calories, protein, fiber, sodium etc.  Conclusion, it's not worth the expense or assault on your taste buds.

review/summary: Isn't working like I thought it would
review/text: I bought this because my legs and ankles had been swollen badly for over a week and this is not normal for me.  Dandelion leaf tea is supposed to be a diuretic, but I've been drinking it for a couple days and there is no difference that I can tell.<br /><br />When steeped for 12 minutes per the directions for medicinal use the flavor is very "grassy" and rather bitter.  I expected the bitter part from the dandelion leaves, but the grassy flavor is a bit hard to take unless I mix it with other teas, drinking twice as much to get the proper dosage of the dandelion.  I tried adding a little bit of honey in the straight tea to cut the grassy taste but I wound up with too sweet plus bitter.<br /><br />I then bought a couple bunches of fresh parsley and made tea from it.  Cost:  around $2 for enough tea for almost two weeks.  However, you won't need to drink parsley tea for more than 2 days at most to have all that excess fluid removed from your body.  It works:  It's cheap; It's natural, and no paper bags to dispose of! One note:  Parsley tea doesn't taste all that great either but you can add other kinds of tea to help the flavor.<br /><br />Save your money... go to your local grocery store and get the parsley.

review/summary: Honey Roasted, Crunchy Goodness That's Not Readily Available Anymore
review/text: Look--it's peanut butter.  If you like your peanut butter crunchy and the hint of honey to go along with it, then this is the peanut butter for you.  It was the peanut butter for you before their recall, and it's the peanut butter for you *after* the recall.<br /><br />But if you're like me, you're in an area of the United States that no longer carries this version of Peter Pan Peanut Butter after the recall.  And if you're also like me, you've also tried to reach out to ConAgra Foods to remedy this, but to no avail.<br /><br />(Note:  ConAgra foods unfortunately has become one of those corporate conglomerates that feels the need to not answer email or to answer only with a robo-response.  Sad, really...)<br /><br />So, if you're in the same boat I am, then pick up a six pack of Peter Pan Honey Roast Crunchy Peanut Butter from Amazon.com, and bask in the glory of knowing that not only do you have a consumer product that isn't available in your neck of the woods, but that you've got a great corporate friend in Amazon that is watching your back and making sure you don't have to sully your jelly with inferior peanut butter.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I purchased this Peanut Butter six pack from Amazon.com on 09/19/2011 for $13.59.  Jars of the creamy version of this peanut butter locally run $2.89 each, which makes the Amazon.com price a very good deal, especially if the price of Peanut Butter climbs this winter as the commodity experts forecast.

review/text: Hands down, this is the best PB out there. I eat it every single day. The honey provides just enough sweetness without turning it into candy, and it's not overwhelmingly crunchy like some others I've tried. It has the perfect ratio of crunch/creamy and it has converted many "I don't like crunchy peanut butter" people in my family over to the dark side. I wish I could get it locally, but stores in my area only carry the creamy variety (which is amazing in it's own right). I'm ecstatic that Amazon carries this ... it's so unbelievably good that I don't mind buying 6 at a time!

review/summary: Terrific peanut butter at a great price
review/text: Peanut butter gourmets who enthuse over esoteric brands won't like me for saying this, but Skippy usually bests everything else in taste tests, and Peter Pan often ties Skippy. Don't believe me? Check out the published reviews of tests with 12 year olds, a key consumer population. The Cooking Light website also has some good reviews.<br /><br />I picked this up because it was less expensive than Skippy's alternative. In a straight-up comparison with Skippy's super chunk, I can't taste any significant difference except for the honey-roasted flavor. And that flavor really makes this offering a winner. It is not cloyingly sweet but just flavorful enough to make eating this peanut butter a real treat just by itself.<br /><br />And I do exactly that, especially during my mid-afternoon hypoglycemic periods. This peanut butter will serve well anyone with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes who hits a low-sugar rough patch.<br /><br />Each jar has 13 servings, and each serving has 190 calories, most of which are from fat. This is enough to chase many into the arms of reduced-fat alternatives. OK. Just remember that this fat is mostly monounsaturated and possibly good for you. Removing such oils may undermine the nutritional value.<br /><br />Don't believe me? Again, check the web. I switched away from reduced-fat peanut butter when I realized that it was more politically correct than nutritionally correct. Anyway, I love this stuff, and so long as I eat moderate amounts, there should be no problem. But it's still tempting to get a spoon and eat a whole jar in front of the TV.

review/summary: Not a peanut butter fan...LOVE this stuff!
review/text: I've never really been fond of peanut butter, but I do love honey and peanuts (it's the texture of peanut butter I don't like, usually, not the taste). Not only do I not gag when I eat this, I love it! I bought it on a whim when I was doing something extremely foolish: online shopping in the dead of the night on an empty stomach. Even though I don't usually like peanut butter, for some reason I just HAD to buy this. I'm glad I did. At first I was worried about how I was supposed to eat 6 jars of peanut butter. My boyfriend only likes creamy peanut butter (which I've never been able to tolerate, personally), so he had two questions for me when I told him what I'd ordered: 1.) Are you crazy? and 2.) Are you PREGNANT? As it happens, I am not pregnant, but crazy? Well...I did order 6 jars of something I didn't think I'd like for no real reason.<br /><br />This peanut butter is sweet without having a strong honey taste, very crunchy, and it doesn't stick to the roof of my mouth or to my throat when I eat it. For me, it is the ideal peanut butter. I've been eating it on bagels with this on one half and cherry preserves on the other half. When I run out of bagels, I'll be making a lot of peanut butter sandwiches!

review/summary: Garlicky!
review/text: If you really like the flavor of garlic then this one's for you! They are small deep fried garlic cubes, not greasy at all, and have a very stout garlic flavor. Work good as croutons in a salad, sprinkled on veggies or mashed potatoes, and on top of grilled steaks, chickens, or pork chops. A little goes a long way so use with caution. If you aren't a true garlic fan, then don't order them, as they are GARLICKY!

A little goes a long way. What to do with all this garlic! The only fried garlic I've had is when I've cooked it myself and mine has never tasted as strong as this stuff. It's very crunchy too. I'm using it sprinkled it on salads, potatoes, and spaghetti. I'm not sure what else to do with it. Contents: garlic and corn oil; a product of Vietnam.

review/text: Okay, the name Tasty Joy Rabbit is a bit bizarre and Mysterious East, but the product is great. It is very garlicky, but we tend to put garlic into and over everything but dessert. Four 14-oz. jars does seem to be a lot, but you can always give one or two to garlic-loving friends. We searched for and found this product on the Web when our nearest Asian market stopped carrying fried garlic, perhaps because the brand they carried was from China and contained God-only-knows-what. This brand is not from China, so be not afraid!

Once again, I turned to Amazon.com to buy my favorites, and I now have a stockpile for at least several months.  Eating one Nugget per day is a great treat and helps control your blood pressure and cholesterol.

review/summary: Excellent taste and decent crema
review/text: Disclosure: I used to work at Peet's coffee, so am used to a decent cup of joe. This Jeremiah's Pick decaf reserve can compete with the best of Peet's decaf, IMHO. It has great flavor and decent crema (if you grind the beans right before brewing, as is best), plus holds up well to sugar & cream unlike many decafs out there. With the subscribe & save Jeremiah's is pretty competitive to other coffees out there. The cost, combined with the taste & quality, make it a very appealing coffee. I really hated switching to decaf at first, but it now it's not bad at all because of Jeremiah's Pick decaf reserve. I've been drinking it for months now and will continue to do so until...well, until I can't anymore. It's really good!

review/summary: My favorite decaf so far
review/text: I'm about a year into trying to find great decaf coffees (caffeine makes me feel like crap, but I LOVE coffee). I've tried at least a dozen brands of decaf and then 1-3 types within each brand in the past year - I'm trying to give each type at least a full bag worth of attention on its own (which takes me probably about 3-4 weeks to finish at one cup per morning and sometimes french press in the evening). This coffee is by far my favorite so far...fresh and good price with great, earthy smells and flavors with great mouth feel and balanced components. I prepare my coffee fresh ground before each cup, single cup filter or french press and drink it black.

review/summary: not awful
review/text: Due to certain specific health issues, I need to avoid too much caffeine as well as acidic food and beverages. I was hoping that this coffee would be a good option for me, as it claims to be a dark roast - dark roast coffees being lower in acid than medium or lighter roast coffees. I was also looking for a decaf that actually tastes good to replace the dark roast organic decaf I used to drink which has recently been discontinued. I did not find what I was looking for in this coffee. It might not be the worst decaf I've ever tried but it tastes, without any doubt, very much like a decaf coffee. No one who loves coffee will ever mistake this for a regular, caffeinated coffee. The roast is not really very dark, the coffee is fairly acidic and the flavor is disappointing. Not terrible, but no better than most other name brand supermarket decafs. I'll keep looking.

She has this never ending hope that I will start eating healthier, get into shape and all that jazz.<br /><br />When they arrived (and she never told me she'd ordered them for me), I took one of the boxes to work ready to give them all away as I was sure I'd hate these as much as I hated all the other 'healthy' bars I've eaten.<br /><br />Before I even tried one I had given two away to a girl at worked that was into healthy eating, sure I could unload the rest on her when I hated them.  She asked me later if I had tried one and I promised I would.<br /><br />I opened the package and was very pleasantly surprised that it smelled good, like something actually eatable.  When I took a bite, I was shocked, it was, delicious.  Absolutely delicious.  I felt totally betrayed by my body that it would not only like something healthy but it embraced it!<br /><br />I promise you, if you're not a lover of health food (like I'm not), you'll find yourself shockingly loving these and wanting more!

review/summary: Gotta try this!
review/text: Arrived super quick and very well packaged. Now, for the taste. Pricey, but worth it to try. Similar to my other review, I could eat an entire pound of the stuff but there is something about small quantities that seems to make me appreciate and enjoy something more than usual. It has a sweet, smooth slightly peppery, with almost a hint of smoke and just enough salt. This differs from the Jamon Iberico in that this is comparable to a really good Capicola and the Jamon is more like a prosciutto. Ok, that was the closest comparison I could think of but by no means an exact match because the flavor profiles differ greatly. The fat is delicious! One thing, perhaps my palate is undeveloped but I did not taste the acorns as many of the reviews mention (not that I have eaten many acorns in my life). So, enjoy this with a piece of Parmigiano-Reggiano, a good crusty bread and a glass of Brunello di Montalcino red wine and you ARE good to go!

review/text: Eaten by themselves, Yacon slices are pretty bland. The taste and texture is somewhat akin to dried apples.<br /><br />I mostly use Yacon in the blender, as a raw chocolate smoothie sweetener, supplementing the goji berries, cacao nibs and some frozen fruit, like blueberries, and maybe some kale. It makes a sweet counterpoint to the bitter stuff like the chocolate and the veggies. Yum.<br /><br />Supposedly, there are also a lot of health benefits to Yacon, and is a diabetic-friendly sweetener. And since it bypasses the GI tract and instead gets processed in the colon, Yacon helps balance the gut flora and aids in digestion.

review/text: I wasn't crazy about these when I first tried them, but I've grown to like them quite a bit.  Off the bat, they're kinda like mildly sweet, slightly bitter plastic shavings, but they have this somewhat indefinable flavor that can be best compared to carrots if carrots dried floppy rather than crispy.  They reconstitute beautifully if you can't deal with the plasticity of dried slices.  Wet, they're like a totally different product.  Anyways, I like them and the probiotic aspect is very helpful since I'm recovering from an ulcer.  They also help counteract the effects of having to take three iron pills a day, which is what makes them a five-star product to me.  I eat them as is.

review/summary: yacon slices...
review/text: Some good points...these are great if you're conscious of your sugar intake...they should't spike you. The taste is better than I was warned they'd be, very similar to dehydrated apples but a milder slightly off taste that takes a couple to get used to, meaning if you have a handful the first few bites are a little strange, not sure how kids would handle them, but that 'off' taste sort of goes away after that and you're left with good texture and a little  light tangy sweetness. The bad...do not have more than a small handful of these at a time unless you enjoy feeling like your intestines are unraveling and exploding through your tummehhh!! The inulin in these can be a double edged sword if you aren't used to it....prebiotics yes but stomach aches NOOOOOO not a fan. I liked the idea the other reviewer left about using it to sweeten tea...this works well... then eat the piece when you are done with the tea. I've read that mixing pre and probiotics is a good way to go and this is an easy way to add some to your diet.<br /><br />In summary use caution but use often as they are good..in smaller quantities.

review/summary: Apple of the Earth
review/text: This yacon is very nutritious and has a sweet, resiny flavor that goes great with tea or smoothies. Yacon is a close relative of the sunflower and Jerusalem artichoke, but tastes kind of like a dried apple with perhaps a hint of sweet potato.<br /><br />The plant itself is a tuber that is composed mostly of water and fructo-oligosaccharides, which are prebiotics that increase the amount of beneficial bacteria in the digestive tract and have also been shown to increase calcium absorption. Yacon is great for diabetics because although it tastes sweet the type of sugar can't be absorbed by humans, but since it feeds the friendly bacteria in the digestive system it boosts the immune system and helps digestion. Yacon is also known for it's high antioxidant activity, and has been used as both a food and medicine by Indigenous Andeans for at least 3200 years.

The other reviews that state it tastes like a combo between a dried apple and a sweet potato are pretty accurate. The somewhat peculiar taste draws those comparisons easily. After some reflection, i decided i really liked these. They are a pretty handy little snack and mix well with other dried fruits and nuts. I anticipate trying them in salad's next, and perhaps cooked with braised greens like kale and such.<br /><br />Anyway, pretty good stuff. I recommend trying it out.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: it simply works!
review/text: I tried this product on the advice of a friend who became constipated after surgery and does it works. If I have a couple of days of no or little bowel movement, I take this and it really works, without fail, It might be the afternoon of the next day when it works, but, believe me it is a  smooth move then, and for a day or so after wards. To me the taste is sort of bland with an licorice after taste. Certainly not unpleasant. Beats laxatives and stool softeners.

review/summary: Smooth Move
review/text: I usually don't like tea AT ALL but this has a nice flavor and I enjoyed drinking it. I used it because my mother told me about it and recommended it (she loves it); she said it was very gentle with no crampy, gassy, sudden urge to go side effects like most laxatives. That was NOT the case with me. I took it before bed and about ten hours later I got horrible gas and cramping which led to me hurrying to the bathroom soon afterwards for a very crampy and unpleasant bowel movement. I would definitely give it a try if you haven't because it works very well. Its just a matter of figuring out how the tea is going to effect you personally.

review/summary: Finally something that works!
review/text: I actually found this a CVS and decided to give it a try.  I was recently diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis and have been on several medications for the last 6 months.  I am usually very regular, but noticed that several days were going by without a bowel movement and I felt bloated all the time.  This is not normal for me so I went off my meds for a week and I went back to being regular!!  But then my RA flared up and I had to go back on my meds and the constipation kicked back in.  I tried the 2 week colon cleanse and drinking prune juice and nothing was working for me.  I had a healthy diet that included lots of fruits and veggies and drank at least 70oz of water a day.  I tried this tea last night for the first time and literally 12 hours later (the box says "usually takes 6-12 hours) I had a bowel movement!  I feel so much better!  The tea itself does not taste bad.  It doesn't taste good, but that is because I'm used to putting sugar in my tea!!  It really didn't have a flavor to me at all; very mild.  You do have to let the teabag steep for 10 minutes, no biggie.  Do drink before bedtime.  I recommend this if you have tried everything and feel like you're not getting results.

review/summary: Much better than laxative tablets.
review/text: I purchased Smooth Move with the hopes of a mini-colon cleanse because I had felt bloated for several weeks and seemed to have more weight around the mid-section despite the fact that my diet had not changed. Having never weighed over 100 pounds except during pregnancies, I was very uncomfortable with my sudden 'spare tire,' and I had at first attributed it to menopause. My first experience drinking the tea was surprizingly pleasant. The taste was like drinking any other flavored tea. There is a pleasing hint of sweetness without added sugar. A bit spicey but mostly I recognize the licorice flavor. The tea did not take 6 to 12 hours to work as the box advises. The results for me began about 2 1/2 hours after drinking the tea. I did experience some minor cramping, however, not as bothersome as my past experiences taking senna tablets, so I do believe some of the other ingredients are helpful in relation to reducing cramps. After 4 visits on the porcelain seat, I felt so much better and lighter. I had been weighing myself daily for several weeks and after my first use, I did in fact lose 4 pounds. I felt less bloated and more like my old self again. I would definitely recommend trying the tea for the first time when you can be near home for 24 hours after since the action is quite sudden and may occur sooner than  6 hours.

review/summary: Best herbal laxative I've had
review/text: I usually drink this tea during my monthly or after a day in which I've had very heavy meals. When compared to products like "Colon Cleanse" this is incredibly gentle on my system. That said, there have been a few times in which I have had mild cramping about 6-10 hours after consuming this. Usually I don't experience the cramps. It has only occurred when I consumed the tea two nights in a row (which the box does not recommend.)<br /><br />It's sometimes hard to not over-consume this tea! Its flavour is very nice and tastes like a delicious night cap! I recommend anyone and everyone to give it a shot-it's worth it!

review/summary: Rough Stuff
review/text: I didn't have such luck with this product as the other reviewers--unfortunately I got SEVERE abdominal cramps the few times I tried it. Still, it's worth a try because it works for many people. Just bear in mind that if you get some bad cramping, you are probably sensitive to SENNA, the active ingredient in the tea. So stay away from other SENNA products, too. (usually labeled "Stimulant Laxative.")<br /><br />So what works for me?  Lots of the high-fiber foods every day.  Plenty of raw fruits (except banana) and vegetables (two raw carrots a day works wonders!)  Whole grains every day makes a big difference--I especially like brown rice and oatmeal. Apples are yummy: I eat one every day.  Eating beans and legumes is also very helpful.  Buy some dried lentils--they cook the fastest--and google some soup recipes. And keep products made with white flour to a minimum.<br /><br />In the worst case scenario, try plain old water. Both ways.<br /><br />Nature is great.

NUTRICITY sent me garlic basil organic polenta (no quinoa in sight).  It took over 11 days to get a return authorization from them that required me to print the label and take the huge box to a Kinko's for return.  Still haven't heard from them about reimbursement and have to say...<br /><br />DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM NUTRICITY.  Customer service is awful and slow, and they make it even less professional with horrible grammar in their written communications.  They wanted me to send them a digital photo to PROVE to them that they had screwed up.  Unbelievable.

review/text: This product is a VERY light roast.  I suppose my not being such a huge fan of this product is due to my own poor research prior to ordering, but I doubt I'll purchase this item again.  The coffee is *ok* but definitely nothing I'm doing backflips over.  The body is far lighter than I would've anticipated or desired.  The aroma isn't bad, though I can't say it seems as fresh as would be desired, either.  All together I'd say this was decidely mediocre.<br /><br />I should also include, though, that I use a Keurig coffee maker, with one of the refill-able baskets (I love the k-cup varieties, but they get to be too expensive for every day use, when you consume as much coffee as I do).  Perhaps this would be a more enjoyable blend if used in a traditional coffee pot, where you have the ability to overload the filter with grounds.  That being said, clearly this is not the coffee for me.

A cap full is at least 2 tablespoons of seasoning.
