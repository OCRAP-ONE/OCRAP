review/summary: My boyfriend LOVES this hot chocolate!!!
review/text: Every year for Christmas I have given my boyfriend different gourmet brands of hot chocolate as stocking stuffers. However three years ago I got Bellagio hot chocolate and that is the ONLY brand he wants. He especially loves the caramel praline and the chocolate truffle. They are smooth and wonderful in warm/hot milk! It's never an over whelming or under whelming flavor. Always delicious. Whether you are sipping it reading a book or having it with friends after a great meal. I highly recommend it!!!

review/summary: This Hot Chocolate is Horrible or maybe it is the batch I received...
review/text: I am a true lover of hot chocolate and this chocolate is not that great.  The taste is flat and does not taste that chocolaty.  I was truly disaapointed so I shared it with a co-worker and she stated that she did not like it either.  Her exact words were, "This has a unusual taste...not good".

review/summary: Food or a chemistry lab?
review/text: What offends me most about this product isn't just the ingredient list that sounds like it comes straight from a mad scientist and takes a lot of reading to even reach anything that sounds remotely like food: I've come to expect that from today's mass market food. What offends me is the blatant misleading marketing. Not only does the package look fancy and have a fancy name, and not only does it say "A European Classic" (this is an American product), and not only does it say "Gourmet Hot Cocoa" (because at an expensive restaurant I always ask the chef for "corn syrup solids"), but worst of all "Savor the flavor of old world style chocolate": because I'm sure in the old world they mixed a nice helping of partially hydrogenated soybean oil and silicon dioxide into their hot chocolate.<br /><br />Someone gave me a package of this stuff and I'm debating whether or not to eat it, so I can't comment on the taste. But the misleading advertising alone, combined with this chemistry lab of ingredients, deserves one star no matter how it tastes.

review/text: This and a Maui Sweet Onion dressing are made by a small company in Kauai - Kauai Kookie [...] and they are great tasting salad dressings. We buy several bottles on our annual trip there and bring them back with us. This particular listing does not say how many bottles one is getting for $17.50, and the vendor will not respond to e-mails, so I ordered it direct from Kauai Kookie for $4.19 per bottle.

review/summary: Just the right amount of heat.
review/text: This extract is perfect for adding heat in increments to recipies. It's not over kill like the 5 million 357 sauce but it can make it as hot as you can stand! My only complaint is that it is so dark in color that it tinges everything red. But hey, beggers cant be choosers. I use a eye dropper to give me fine controll over how much I use. for smaller batches of food three drops usually does good. Where I might use five with larger quantities like a jamabalya. There is is pleanty of room to adjust as your heat tolerance grows. At this rate the bottle should last a year or so. By the time I am done maybee I will be ready for the 357.

review/summary: Autistic son loves this pasta!
review/text: My son loves this pasta!  He is on a GF/CF/SF diet so has limited food choices.  He used to grab the bag out of the pantry to ask for it.  Now I have added it to his picture cards so he can flip through the cards and ask for it.  He loves the texture and the shapes and colors are fun.  The rest of the family will eat it as well.  It has a great texture when cooked al-dente and when stored in the refrigerator does not get mushy.

review/text: First we tried Tinkyada rice pasta and we could eat it but it was mushy and soft. This brand tastes better too and holds up just like wheat pasta if you don't evercook it.  It is good reheated and can be eaten in cold dishes.  My son loves it.  The animal shapes are fun. I also like that it is organic and whole grain.

review/summary: Good but they fall apart easily
review/text: These are fun little shapes for kids.  We love them and they work great for our GFCF diet, however, they do fall apart quite easily - and that's with cooking them just until done.  Unlike traditional pasta, they are not the greatest when they are "leftovers" because they lose a lot of moisture and harden.  Overall, a pretty good product and we are happy to have them so that we don't miss out on pasta simply because we do not eat gluten.

review/text: Both of my sons LOVE this pasta.  I, personally, think that Tinkyada pastas taste better (more like "real" pasta), but my kids like this just as much.  I think the fun, animal shapes make it more appealing to them.  They love the letter-shaped pasta (made by the same company) as well.  I wish the company hadn't made the pasta-size larger though, as my kids liked the smaller size better.  Oh well, they still like it and I'm thrilled to have found it on Amazon.  Our local MOMs store stopped carrying it, so we haven't had it in quite some time.

review/summary: Nice Creamy Soup with Good Flavor
review/text: This is a purely smooth and silky soup, not a bean or veggie chunk to be found. I loved the consistency actually; it was like a light cream rather than a starchy thick soup. But, I can never leave well enough alone. I saut&eacute;ed three sweet carrots in 1 teaspoon of oil, then added the soup to heat, and served it up with some chopped avocado. The combination was delightful.<br /><br />The soup on its own had a wonderful taste and just the right amount of flavor in terms of heat (not too much!), spices, and salt. Nothing was over the top, and it all melded rather nicely. There was just one note that kept tasting "off" to me. It was mostly in the aftertaste, so it didn't deter me from devouring the bowl. Nonetheless, it left me curious, so I checked the ingredients and finally spotted the culprit ... cilantro paste. Yes, I am one of those cilantro supertasters who generally dislike it. Cilantro fans will find this soup spot on, but luckily, the cilantro is far enough down the ingredient list that even most "cilantro tastes like soap" people (such as me) will enjoy it.<br /><br />I will purchase this soup again either for a quick lunch, or as a recipe starter ... it has great potential! Plus, I love that it is both dairy-free and soy-free.

review/text: Funny thing is I dont like beans...or rather the texture of beans. I tried this yummy soup over 2 years ago and<br />it is so good I have a 8oz cup daily. The soup is puree'd with no bean texture. The black bean and mild to medium hot spice's and flavors ...with a hint of cilatro is a very satisfying soup. Think would make a great layer to the traditional 7 layer taco dip as well. Only suggestion is to slightly lower the sea salt content - although it is not nearly as high as most soups out there. Best soup ever!!

review/text: The price I pay thru Amazon for Pacific brand soup is SO much cheaper than my local store! And as I love black bean soup [not to mention the fact it is so nutritious, plus loaded with fiber] a dozen boxes will not grow dusty in my pantry. I was surprised, tho, that this soup is a puree, and thus has no real lumps of beans in it, so it has no textural interest in my mouth to slow down my swallow. I'm going to get some cans of a good black bean, rinse of the gooey slime they can them in and add it to the soup. yum.<br /><br />the kick of the spice in this soup is excellent, tho, and can easily contain the added beans without neutralizing the fun of the spicy sting... of course, this puree is an excellent base to use to create all sorts of veggie, legume and cheese combos, for a lot of variety in my soups, not to mention chunks of chicken, minced scallions and a dollop of sour cream. yum.

review/summary: Tasty, Healthy Affordable Dark Chocolate
review/text: If you love chocolate and want a non-guilty pleasure, nutritionists recommend one oz. of dark chocolate above 70% per day.  As a friend said, chocolate is a vegetable--it's a bean!  I bought this bag of individually wrapped chocolates and have one for a tasty treat after dinner.  They are healthy and darkly rich and smooth.  I'm happy with one square, and frankly, it helps to have them individually wrapped so you can't keep breaking off small pieces of a large bar.<br /><br />One square is about 75 calories--it's a thin larger square and is satisfying.  If you want to spoil yourself, or someone else, with something that is good for them, consider these chocolates!  I love them.

review/summary: The very best chicken and turkey seasoning EVER!!
review/text: I was discouraged when this seasoning was discontinued by Nantucket Off-Shore.  I searched for it on many websites and finally found it on Amazon.com.  They only offered it in lots of six tins.  However, it is so good, that I was willing to buy six containers of it.  It is in sealed tins, so I suspect it has a long shelf life.  The mixture of herbs and spices is simply perfect for turkey and chicken.  When I have a chicken roasting, the aroma is out of this world, but the taste is even better.  It is the best I have ever used in my 46 years of cooking.

review/text: As a mom to a child with severe peanut and tree nut allergies, it was quite challenging to find raw pumpkin seeds that were free of allergen cross-contamination concerns (the same is true for raw sunflower seeds, something I also purchased from Gerbs).  The pumpkin seeds worked wonderfully and tasted great in the recipes where I needed/wanted raw seeds -- our bag emptied too quickly!  It's a relief to find another source for safe, allergy-friendly food for our family.  Gerbs also is great to work with; one of our bags arrived to our home already opened, spilling most of the bag of seeds inside the packing box.  Gerbs responded immediately to my e-mail by shipping a new bag via priority mail.

review/summary: Raw unsalted shelled pumpkin seeds
review/text: The 2-pound plastic bag came inside a US postal bag that was secured with an extra length of fiberglass reinforced tape strip over the sealing flap. Very considerate packaging for mailing.<br /><br />I would have given 5 stars if the plastic bag from the manufacturer was more heavy duty. When trying to open the resealable package by the strips above the seal, the plastic strips tore off. When opening the bag, pull the formed seals open by grasping below the strip where the seeds are held. Then the bag might open without tearing off tabs. That's how I open the bag now that the upper flaps are gone.<br /><br />I poured half the bag into an empty Swanson 1-lb bag from a previous order that is heavier packaging.<br /><br />The seeds themselves are large and have a very good taste.

review/text: When I received the box of green tea, I realized I had ordered the wrong tea. I had wanted to purchased the  Stassen "Pure Jasmine Green Tea". So, I sent it back to the company the next day and asked them to please send the Jasmine tea instead. That was more than a month ago, still no tea or response.  Last week I decided to order another box. I don't know if it was from the same company through Amazon but, I got it in less than a week.  I doubt I'll ever see the other box or my $13.00 again, but thank you for the speedy delivery on this one.  I have always had incredibly great service with Amazon...amazing in fact...but, I don't know what happened with the one before.  Let me just say that the Jasmine Green Tea by Stassen is the best ever! About 5 years ago I was in Seattle and visited a restaurant where they served this tea with the meals. It was refreshing and light so I asked the name of it. I have been ordering this same tea ever since and enjoy a cup first thing in the morning with my meditation routine. You can't beat the price and it's so worth it.

review/summary: Very Pure. No Added Fat. Good Price.
review/text: I've been buying this for some time. It's expensive but I only eat it once in a while. But now my teenage daughter has discovered it and I can hardly keep the pantry stocked. So I'm glad I thought to check on amazon. With Subscribe and Save it's cheaper than I ever find it in the store (and only one store in my area carries it).<br /><br />What a great food for a teenager to be eating! She makes a parfait with granola, berries and yogurt.<br /><br />Ingredients: whole grain rolled oats, evaporated can juice, pineapple juice concentrate, pear juice concentrate, peach juice concentrate, vitamin E, natural flavor.<br /><br />It is very hard to find granola without added fat. And I really dislike puffed things like rice krispies in granola and it's hard to find that too.

review/text: This is the best plain granola I've come across. Even my 21 month old loves this stuff, and she's quite the picky eater! Excellent source of fiber and whole grains to go with breakfast or an evening snack. And this package offered by Amazon is the best deal I've come across anywhere. The grocery store jacks the price of this by a single bag around so much it gives me whip lash. I pay between a 1/5 and 1/4 of the price of this six pack at the grocery store for ONE. At the very least I'm getting one free by buying this way. Definetly a deal, worth the money and excellent quality.

It also makes me happy to know that I am providing healthy bread products for my family.  For where we live, the price is perfect too as I can buy this floor on Amazon with free shipping cheaper than I can buy non-organic flour from our local store... we live in a very small community.

review/summary: Terrific organic flour at a great price
review/text: I've been buying Great River organic flour for over a year now.  The multi-grain bread flour and the whole wheat bread flour come in cases of 5 pound bags.  This all purpose flour is one large 25 pound bag.  I have Tupperware containers to store it but you should be aware of that.<br /><br />I've been very pleased with all the Great River organic flours.  I am particularly happy with the price that Amazon has.  I have shopped around, including some great local stores that normally have good prices for organic products but nobody beats Amazon's price.  I always make sure to order enough to qualify for free shipping.  The only product I couldn't get free shipping on (see review for Spectrum baking spray with flour) was still  cheaper even with the shipping costs.

review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.<br /><br />Edit (10/01/10)- The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great.

review/summary: **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************
review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

review/summary: pig ears
review/text: I will never order from this person again. They took what would be 1. pig ear and cut it into 3 very small strips. Instead of my dog getting one full pig ear he got  strips of a pig ear. What was even worse is that I got 25 pieces of the strips which was equivalent to maybe 8 full size pig ears. I'm sticking with Sam's or Costco. This place ripped me off by charging $17 bucks for strips instead of a full ear.  Additionally, the strips had the hair still attached. My dog loved them anyway but I had to give him 3 at a time to make up for the 1 so the bag lasted for a week. Terrible!!!

review/text: Good pig ears for the price.  I think they pack the bags by weight - the bag seemed to be the appropriate weight, but some of the pig ears were more like the pig ear slivers.  I didn't actually count the number of pig ears, though, so they may have made up for it by increasing the quantity.  also, pig ears were really greasy - lots of grease in the bag.  For the price, a good  buy.

Ended up throwing away.  May have just been a bad batch.  Probably came from China.  I think the Chinese have some sort of conspiracy to kill our dogs.  Seems to be a lot of recalls over dog treats that come from China.<br /><br />My newest batch came from some good old boys in Iowa.  I'm feeling a lot better about them.

With that being said, the taste and texture of the crust was great for a dessert pie. Unfortunately, I spent $35 on pie crusts for chicken pot pie that tasted bad.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this gum.  Yes, the peppermint is strong at first and fades within two minutes, but it doesn't completely go away and the gum stays pliable and chewable.  The pieces are larger (75%-100%) than Spry's and you can blow bubbles with them!  There is no titanium dioxide  or glycerine in them (like Spry) and I feel this a better choice for our family.<br /><br />I will continue to purchase this gum for oral health and enjoyment.  Nice to have a gum that isn't loaded with chemicals that I can give my children.

review/summary: Tastes disgusting and the peppermint flavor is extremely short lived
review/text: I really, really do not like this gum. It might be gluten free and "natural", but it tastes disgusting. The peppermint flavor only seems to be in the outer candy shell of the gum. So you chew and break the shell, then swallow that part and then the taste is gone. The taste only lasts about the time it takes to chew up a Tic Tac and swallow it and doesn't leave the pleasant aftertaste a Tic Tac does. Then after that candy shell is gone, to me at least, it tastes like chewing on a wood chip and is almost as hard. I can't stand chewing it even as long as minute. I think I might get more out of chewing on ice. Sorry, I really tried to like this, but I'm taking a pass on this brand of gum.

review/summary: Allegro Orginal Marinade
review/text: This marinade is out of this world. I won't use anything else on my brisket. Picking up more today to try on a roast. I haven't found any product better than this. It's a bit on the extravagant side, but so worth it. You won't be disappointed. Now that I know they have new products, may try those. (Yes they have a new brisket sauce. I'll still use this on my brisket. Can't go wrong with perfection. Brisket recipe: Take a brisket with a nice slab of fat over it (you can take it off later) not too thick not too thin (you need this for keeping the meat moist and tender). Pour 1-2 bottles over the brisket (depends on the size) in a deep roasting pan (I use an enamel pan)deep enough to be able to put a piece of foil over the top without touching the brisket. Seal the edges of the foil around the pan to make a tent. Put in the oven at 250-275 degrees for a few hours. ( Frozen brisket is even better) if frozen, then cook longer (at least double time) You can check it from time to time. Watch out for the steam when you roll back a corner/side. Check with a fork to see if it starts to flake, taste it, you'll know if it's done. This will be the flaky, moistest brisket you ever ate. (skim off the fat and throw away). S-l-o-w cooking is the way to go with brisket. This marinade is what makes it sooooo good.

I really like the maple and brown sugar oatmeal.  It tastes great, and the smell is out of this world.  Just smelling the stuff makes me want to eat about 6 packets.  I normally put two packets into the mix because one is not enough quantity wise.  If you like oatmeal at all you will like this.<br /><br />AD2

review/summary: Instant Oatmeal is Now a Staple
review/text: Quaker Oats have been a staple in my family for generations. It was the only oatmeal that my maternal grandmother prepared, although she always used the Old Fashioned Oatmeal that was actually cooked (and added real sugar, not sweetner, and whole milk for the best oats I ever ate). If she were alive today, I know she would have tried Quaker Instant Oatmeal in the packets. Prepared according to package directions, the oatmeal comes out smooth with no lumps. I found the brown sugar taste more than acceptable, but as usual with maple flavor I don't find it authentic, and there was a bit of an aftertaste. Each packet is one serving, which I don't find sufficient for a whole breakfast, so adding toast and fruit, or bacon or sausage on the side makes for a meal that will stay with you for more than an hour or two. The packets are convenient for campers, hikers, vacationers, or office workers as they do not take up much room, and can be prepared quickly where hot water is available. And they can be eaten just plain, without milk, and still be a  quick meal or snack.

review/summary: Excellent for what it is
review/text: I used to eat a lot of this when I first "discovered" the pleasure of oatmeal about a year ago. Now, I make my own using Quaker's "Old Fashioned Oats," (or Target's cheaper equivalent), which takes only 10 minutes or so, allows me to control the sweetness to my liking by adding the maple syrup and brown sugar myself, and doesn't give me any "artificial flavors" or "guar gum," or "caramel color."<br /><br />Given that, I will say that, for an instant product, this is pretty good, though just a bit too sweet for me. Its first ingredient is Whole Grain Rolled Oats (although the second is sugar) and it does have a reasonably creamy consistency which you would expect from oatmeal. I actually preferred Quaker's high fiber variation of this product, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MWASW6">Quaker Instant Oatmeal, High Fiber, Maple Brown Sugar, 12.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. I think that one is a little less sweet than this one and the 10 grams of fiber is an attraction if you're trying (like I am) to get more fiber into your diet.<br /><br />It's absurd to compare this to "old fashioned" or "steel cut" oatmeal. This is a convenience product that requires no preparation and which you would use when you don't have the time or inclination to fuss with the others. It should be evaluated (and consumed) with this in mind.

review/summary: Oatmeal with maple brown sugar ~ not sugar with a little oatmeal
review/text: I am one of those people who believes that the predominant taste of any kind of oatmeal should be the oatmeal and not whatever the added flavoring might be.  This Quaker product has a subtle aroma of maple and a hint of sweetness that enhances rather than overwhelms the oatmeal.  I did not find it at all artificial and there was no strange after taste.  My preference is always for longer cooking oats but busy mornings are not always conducive.  The consistency seems better when cooked in the microwave as opposed to pouring boiling water.  For a quick and healthy breakfast or snack, this is a good option.

Unfortunately, I haven't tried the "old" recipe so I can't make a comparison. The box I received says "Classic Recipe" so it may be that they have gone back to the old recipe? I'm not sure.<br /><br />I made this oatmeal with milk and found it to average. I don't mind eating it but I've had better. Even though sugar is second on the ingredient list, I didn't think that this oatmeal had a very sweet taste. I could just barely taste brown sugar and I couldn't taste a maple flavor at all. If I'm going to eat something with a lot of added sugar then I want it to taste sweet! This was very filling and kept me full until lunch time.

review/text: Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar is a staple item in our household.  It allows for versatility, since you can eat it alone, as well as with nuts and/or fruit mixed in.  One of my favorite things to do is to add raisins and pecans!  In addition, it is a practical item to take to work when you can't have breakfast at home and fix it in a coffee mug in the microwave during a break.  I prefer to have it with milk, but it is very good when fixed with water too.  It is also a very nutritious breakfast that may reduce cholesterol, help with digestion, and reduce the risk of heart disease - and it only has 160 calories per serving if prepared with water!  I highly recommend it!
