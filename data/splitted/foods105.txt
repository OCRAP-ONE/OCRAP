review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: This is a nice freezer tray. The base is so supple; it's really easy to pop the food out. The size is a little large for what I need at the moment. My baby is 6 months old and only eats the ice-cube size portions right now, but I can see that the larger size of this Beaba tray will come in handy as my baby grows.

review/summary: Not the best and does take up room.
review/text: My daughter wanted 3 of these so she could make my 1st grandbaby her food. I bought them and then 3 boxes of the One Step reusable stackable Fresh and Freeze as i thought the latter would be better.<br />These are hard to remove when frozen and you end up touching the other sections and contaminating them. You have to run hot water over the section you want to remove. You cannot see thru the lid if you put different food in a container.<br />These are way too expensive when you can buy the other Fresh and Freeze by One Step Ahead that can go from the freezer, microwave then the dishwasher.<br />I do not recommend wasting your $$$ when yoy can have the same results with ice cube trays covered to freeze than placing them in baggies. Idea is to make the food freeze it and leave it until ready to use:)

review/summary: The Best On The Market
review/text: The Best On The Market<br /><br />I was looking for a several good Ice cube Tray ,  in order to freeze what i need for making Excellent Iced Coffee In Granita Style !<br /><br />I have search and search on amazon and there are so many...<br /><br />AND THIS ONE'S ARE THE BEST<br /><br />And why ?<br /><br />Because it made from Silicone , it very easy to pull out the cubes , it does not receive odor as it has cover , it will never brake and it will lass for many years of use , it is much more comfortable then any other ice cube tray , and it is EXCELLENT for freeze stuff for Blender use .<br /><br />So for example:<br />You purchase a special powder coffee which the coffee company's sale for Iced Coffee (it comes in a pack of 1 Kg) , and if you want to make it in a blander carafe of 1.5 Liter  , then you take 250 grams of this special coffee powder and you mix it with around 50 ml of worm water.<br />You freeze apart 1.4  Liter of milk in this Trays , and you also freeze around 50 ml fresh espresso , and then you put all in the blender and blend it.<br />Viola - you have Iced Coffee same as in the restaurant without the need to use granita machine which cost $2000.00 USD<br />You can add Kalua Liqueur or Irish Cream Liqueur to the blender mix if you like.<br /><br />AS for the Coffee Powder:<br />You have to contact one of the Coffee Company's like Segafredo Coffee , Or Lavazza Coffee Or illy Coffee , and all of them sale's powder coffee for Iced Coffee for Granita Machine.<br />So you purchase it from them , and you use it in your blender in the way i described here above.<br /><br />Thanks

review/summary: Great for larger portions
review/text: These are great for making larger portions of baby food. I think I'll use them more as my baby gets older. For my 7-month-old, one cube makes about 2-3 servings of food for her. I love that it has a cover, and the silicone makes it really easy to pop the food out. But, it's pretty pricey for just 7 slots of food, and the fewer slots make it harder to mass-produce baby food unless you buy multiples of the trays.

review/text: I bought these to freeze my son's baby food. Well, they work just like you want them too.

review/text: After trying several other products for freezing baby food, I came accross this item and although I was not thrilled about the price, ordered it and was pleased with the ease of use. The tray is easy to fill, has a working lid, easy to empty once frozen and easy to wash. If you're making big batches of baby food (like I was) then you will need to buy more than one tray, but it's worth it to have a product that delivers.

review/summary: Great for things other than baby food as well
review/text: My baby isn't born yet so I haven't used this for baby food yet, but I HAVE used it for freezing homemade chicken stock. I just filled the 2 ounce cups, popped it into the freezer and then stuck the frozen segments into a ziplock and then repeated. It makes the perfect-sized little portions and is extremely easy to use. I love how flexible the silicone is and am looking forward to finding other uses for this. I would highly recommend this to anyone, not just those wanting to use it for baby food.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, it is not airtight so it could get freezer burn. But I have never had this issue and you can avoid it as well by simply transferring the portions to a freezer bag once it's frozen. If you are looking for a container to hold what you make in the freezer indefinitely, this is not the product for you.<br /><br />I like this so much, in fact, I would have purchased a second or even third one for convenience if it weren't for the price. Once my baby is old enough, I have a feeling I will be investing in another though.

We definitely got our money's worth!!<br /><br />After five months, we had a little issue with a funny smell (it did not smell like any of the food we froze) so I tossed the trays.  Scandinavian Child replaced them immediately.  they even tried to match the colors we had!<br />they REALLY stand behind their product. Their customer service was amazing; their genuine helpfulness and accountability for their product is so refreshing!!<br /><br />I look forward to having they trays again, and I would definitely recommend them.

It is great to make your portions and then throw this in the freezer. Once frozen I pop out the portions with ease and bag them for later use. If there is anything you need to freeze (such as portions of stock, or soup) these are perfect for that. A great multi-use product.

review/summary: I Love These Trays!!!!!!!
review/text: I have been making my baby food since she was 6 months old.  These trays are fantastic and allow me to make large batches of baby food and freeze for reheating throughout the week.  I originally purchased two trays, but my 8 month old baby is eating two servings for lunch and dinner, so I ordered two more trays.  Not only are they colorful and fun, but so easy to clean and the frozen baby food pops right out after running the tray under warm water for a few seconds.  Although these trays are kind of expensive, they are totally worth the money if you only feed your baby homemade food.  I wish that these trays would have been on the market back when my son was a baby, as I had the entire door of my freeze full of small tupperwear with baby food and these trays would have made my life easier back then.  By the way, if you want to save more space in your freezer, you can just pop the baby food out of the trays and store in a freezer bag.  I absolutely love them and I highly recommend this product.

Just a few twists and turns on the tray and the food balls pop out. They're so easy to clean too, dishwasher safe. I bought 3 more of these so I have 4 trays in different colors. Looks super cute in my freezer! :)  I would DEFINITELY recommend these to my friends.

review/text: I bought the Beaba freezer trays along with the Beaba Babycook. Initially I thought why on earth did I spent that money?? However, after making baby food for three months, I can say it was totally worth it.<br />The trays are indeed expensive, but they are far superior to your average ice cube tray. If you do not overfill it, the frozen food does pop out super easy. It is BPA free, so safe for baby. And it lasts a lot longer than a normal ice tray, which I also use to freeze my baby food if I run out of the beaba ones (I freeze in batches).<br />Just a great product, and it has helped making my daughter's food a lot of fun and super simple.

review/text: This is by far the easiest way I've found to freeze baby food and get it out again. The getting it out again is key - it can be really hard to get frozen puree out of ice cube trays without cracking the tray. It's also dishwasher safe. The only drawback is that it doesn't prevent freezer burn so if that's a concern for you, you'll need to put it inside of a freezer bag.

I highly recommend purchasing single food pods that you can just toss into a lunch bag and go, and defrost independently wherever you are.

review/summary: Dense bread/cake, intense chocolate swirls, hint of chocolate liquor
review/text: This is the dense flavorful chocolate cake associated with eastern European Jewish tradition, although anyone who loves cake and chocolate will appreciate this. This cake is especially generous with the chocolate, which is more dark chocolate than milk chocolate (but that is healthy, right?). The texture is more like bread than cake, but in a good way. I would buy it again, or its sister cake, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096R2R6S">Greens Mini Cinnamon Babka - 16 Oz</a>.<br /><br />So why only 4 stars? I am not sure but I think I detect more than just a hint of chocolate liquor. Which I like. But if there were small children in the house it could be a problem. The label makes no mention of the chocolate liquor but there is clearly a pleasant alcohol flavor. Similar to the alcohol flavor one finds in a really good rum cake.<br /><br />Speaking of which, if this chocolate babka is out of stock, you can't go wrong with this amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GJOROU">Tortuga Caribbean Rum Cake, Golden Original, 33-Ounce Cake</a>. Don't want to commit to the 33-Ounce cake yet? No worries, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GJQ5C2">Tortuga Original Caribbean Rum Cake, 16-Ounce Cake</a> or even the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY0SLU">Tortuga Caribbean Golden Original Rum Cake, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />Bon Appetit to all my foodie brothers and sisters! :)

review/summary: Bad quality
review/text: This is the first product I ordered from sprouthouse.  I used Kitchen crop sprouter to make sprouts.  But somehow more than 50% of seeds doesn't germinate.  Specifically I think all the alfalfa seeds are getting wasted from this mix.  Initially I thought may be I am doing some thing wrong.  But when I tried the plain alfalfa seeds which I got as sample pack with the sprouter,  they germinated fine and I got the good yield.  Later on I tried the Raddish mix from the sprout house and they seem to be doing fine. But this mix no matter what I do,  i.e., watering more number of times, keeping in dark place etc didn't help.  I guess either I got the seeds from a bad batch or they are too old stock. I tried to see weather I can contact them from my orders, but could not figure it out.  I am giving 3 stars thinking the pack I got from a bad batch. I didn't bother try to return as I used up half of the pack during this tryouts.

review/summary: Great sprouts, wish the price was a little lower
review/text: I made the mistake of trying to sprout about a half cup of sprout seeds, and it made so many sprouts it lasted us two weeks!<br /><br />Really needs some directions on the package in terms of quantity (I'd suggest sprouting a 1/4 cup of seeds to start!).<br /><br />The sprouts are really great on salads.  Have a little bit of a hot mustard bite.<br /><br />My only concern is the price.  $13 a pound for sprouts seems a little high to me, even though these are quality sprouts (and free shipping).<br /><br />So I gave the sprouts four stars based on lack of directions on the package and price.

review/summary: Great mix
review/text: The seeds came in a plastic bag with a baggie tie.  About 90% of the seeds germinated.  This mix is a bit spicy if eaten alone.  However, it tastes great when eaten with other vegetables or in a sandwich.  One of my new favorite ways to eat these sprouts is add a spoonful of hummus to the sprouts.  It adds flavor and cuts the spiciness of the sprouts.  Give it a try!  I top my salads with these sprouts as well.<br /><br />I used 3 tablespoons of this seed mixture to sprout in the Easy Sprout.  My house is coolish in the winter (55F - 65F) so I put the Easy Sprouter in the oven which is a bit warmer than the rest of the house.  If you need to make it even warmer, turn on the oven light to add a bit more heat!  NEVER turn on the oven itself as that would cook the seeds and melt your Easy Sprouter!<br /><br />Here are my sprouting steps for my sprouter:<br /><br />1.  Since there are small alfalfa seeds in this mix, put in the small-slit insert to the inner slit cup to prevent these seeds from washing out.  Put the inner cut into the outer cup.  Soak 2 - 3 tablespoons of seed in the sprouter for 12 hours.  Put on the slit dome cap to allow aeration.  Put the sprouter in the oven for a warmer environment if needed.  Otherwise, leave it on the kitchen counter.  (You do not need light for sprouting.)<br /><br />2.  Pull out the inner cup (with the slits) to drain out the water. Turn on the faucet to give the seeds a "shower" and allow the water to drain out completely.  Shake the inner cup and tap it against the sides of the sink to drain out all water.  Put the inner cup back into the outer cup (solid cup without slits).  Put back on the slit dome and put the sprouter back into the oven.<br /><br />3. Repeat #2 every 12 hours for about 4-5 days.  It's necessary to give your sprouts showers to wash off any potential mold and to maintain moisture around the seeds.<br /><br />5. On the last day, you can also put your sprouter near in indirect light to get some greening of the leaves.  It's not necessary but it sure is pretty to see the little green leaves on the sprouts.<br /><br />6. To store your sprouts, just take off the dome lid and put on the vented lid.  It'll keep for about a week or so.<br /><br />For videos and recipes, check out SproutPeople.

review/summary: Spicy, not mild!
review/text: If you like mild sprouts, like alfalfa, you might not like this.  The Radish and Broccoli sprouts taste similar to their adult counterparts and pretty much rule the taste of the mix.  Personally, I like it, but my wife was disgusted.  To each their own, I say...  Just be forewarned.<br /><br />Also, start small!  These produce a LOT of sprouts.  I started with about a tablespoon and that was plenty for the grower I used.

review/text: These seeds grow perfectly in my easy sprouter. 1/4 cup of seeds in 5 days. make 2 full cups without fluffing. They give me energy but I don't like radishes and the radishes overwhelm the more suttle flavors. I would like it without the radish or with just a touch of radish. This is the perfect food for someone who loves radishes. I tried them in salads, stews, spaghetti sauce,great in eggs and on pimento cheese sandwiches even with the radish taste.

review/summary: What sprouts is good
review/text: This is a good mix, and sprouts well, except half the smaller seeds - not sure whether it is clover or alfalfa, don't sprout. If all of them had sprouted this would have been five stars!<br /><br />I sprout using a glass jar or stainless steel vessel, and a tea strainer to change the water. Initially, I thought that I was getting white fungus, and threw out a few batches. Later, I realized one of the seeds (broccoli or radish), has fuzzy hair in the sprout which looks like white fungus unless you inspect it closely.<br /><br />I got the mix because the seeds are not available in smaller quantities, and I did not want to buy 4 pounds worth of seeds. But given the fact that there are too many blanks in a mix, I think I will try ordering just two individual seeds next time.

It's delicious, it sprouts really well, and it holds up well afterward (we always have multiple batches of different mixes at the same time, and these sprouts can last the longest).  And I had no idea that radish sprouts taste just as good as radishes.  I look forward to trying other mixes from the Sprout House.

Before serving, however, it would be important to inform each guest that they would only receive one Pop Tart, and that seconds would not be possible. Unless, of course, one person decided against eating their Pop Tart. In this case, one person could have seconds, and so on. I would advise against this, however, as it would be rude to the other guests to provide seconds to one and deny the others.

review/summary: Funyuns? Certainly no but BETTER
review/text: To those who believe these Onion Rings doesn't have enough 'FLAVOR'; that flavor is what we call sodium.<br />Want to eat 20 bag of high sodium funyuns? Be my guest. In my opinion, these bring the subtle balance between<br />highly saturated flavor with 150% dosage of sodium in one bag vs more decent amount of sodium with just enough flavor<br />to taste it. Yes, bringing the health factor in the chips section is hypocritical but in the end everything counts right?<br /><br />Bottom line is, you will like these alot! Give it a try and you will more or less love them!

review/text: These bring back so many memories (this and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQNK6Y">Nong Shim Shrimp Cracker, 2.64-Ounce Packages (Pack of 30)</a>) I used to live off of this as a kid growing up in South America.  These are definitely milder than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TZQXGE">Funyuns Onion Flavored Rings, 6.5oz (Pack of 4)</a> but I actually prefer these over Funyuns, because to me it tastes "sweeter" or less bitter I guess. Maybe it's the Korean blood in me (lol).<br /><br />I also uploaded a photo of the nutrition info, and you'll be happy to know they do not contain MSG (and it has 100mg less sodium than Funyuns per serving).<br /><br />Now and then I still pick these up and they still taste good.  Although being all grown up my snacks are mostly cereal or nuts and fruit, but when I walk by them in the Korean market I'm so tempted (falling into temptation many times) to buy these!

review/text: I had originally bought these in medium for my golden retriever puppy. When she finished that box she had outgrown them so I bought the large.  While she loves these, she devours them in no time and her breath is no better. I do not think she fully digested them either. While she was a puppy they helped with puppy breath a lot because she ate them slowly, however I would not recommend these if you have a large dog that eats things quickly.

Only problem is it is hard to find this product in my local pet stores and on line.

review/summary: This is the equivalent of kitty crack!
review/text: My cats go INSANE for these treats. I am a veterinarian, and my cats are pretty spoiled. I have bought all kinds of treats, the Evo ones, the Friskies temptations, the Pounce, the Greenies, the moist hairball treats; you name it.  One of my cats is a piggy; you really can't trust her opinion. She'd eat anything.  However, my other cat is super finicky, and she simply adores these treats.  I also love that these appear so ethically made.  I can't always say a product is green just because it is green on the label; lots of manufacturers dupe consumers into buying "natural" products that aren't any healthier than the feline equivalent of a Snickers bar.  But after reading the label, I can't say I seriously knock this manufacturer. The ingredients look pretty good.  Can't say Amazon is the best place to buy these treats, though.  I saw em for 3.99 at another website.  So shop around, but when you get a good deal on these treats, buy them.  Your kitties will thank you.  And follow you all around the house begging loudly.

review/text: We have a very picky cat. He turns his nose up to well-loved kitty delights such as Fancy Feast, Friskies, or anything too low-brow for his tastes. He LOVES these treats, which says a lot. You never can predict what your cat's taste buds will enjoy, but I'd recommend these treats on the basis that a) a picky kitty likes them; and b) they don't stink to high hell.

review/text: You have to get kitty used to them, as they are kinda rubbery, and smell funny. My cat took to the treats well, after a bit of coaxing; and sometimes if she doesn't eat them, I just pinch them in half, and she gobbles them up. My cat is equally fond of both flavors, salmon and chicken; If I don't store them away properly, the next morning I find the pouch torn and chewed up.<br /><br />This is a great treat if you can't/don't grow cat grass.

review/text: Now that the Pounce Hairball Treats are discontinued, I needed to find a new way of hiding treats for my cat's twice-daily medicine. I was hoping that these would be pliable enough to wrap around the very small pill. Unfortunately, they crumble whenever any pressure is applied. The cat adores them, but I have to be very careful when giving her her meds now, and make sure she eats the pill, not just the treat.<br /><br />Once these are gone, I'll be looking for something else.

review/summary: Two paws up from Chicken and Biscuit
review/text: My two boys LOVE the semi-moist Pet Greens treats. Admittedly, Biscuit is not overly choosey, but Chicken has turned up his nose at the other treats I've tried. Now, if I say "treat" or even reach toward where I keep them, Chicken comes running. They DO smell weird -- kind of like not-so-freshly mowed grass, but the odor quickly dissipates and the kitties love 'em. So far we've tried the chicken (ironically enough) and the salmon and both have been equally well-received.

review/summary: Sadly, not a winner here
review/text: Well, I had high hopes for these treats, which are small, and smell terrible. They are semi-moist treats. Other than the smell, they seem like a fine product, just not for my boy Wesley. He was totally uninterested. He sniffed it once, and that was it. He wouldn't even chase it when it rolled across the room. (A clear poor sign.) So, although the resealable packaging is great, and the cat depicted on the bag is cute, this won't be a winner in our household. Perhaps a different flavor would be better.<br /><br />One thing to note, Wesley has not had semi-moist treats before, so that could be it as well. Hopefully your cat will have happier results!

review/text: I like this. I have had more expensive truffle oils before, but I am perfectly happy with this. Just because it's not from france doesn't mean its not good! A good sparkeling wine (champange) from california, is still better than a bad one from champange france. The tase is waht I expected. Mine were packaged in shrink wrapped plastic and padding stuff, and arrived ok. Truffles, I understand, grow in many places in the world. I haven't tasted the finest quality (cannot find it, much less afford it), but this tastes similar to the other black truffle oils I have tasted (that were more expensive). I have no reservations recommending it, as long as you understand its not as subtile as white truffle, i.e its a bit stronger of a taste. It all what you like and can afford. Its great stuff!<br /><br />The other reviewer should have asked for a replacement, not a refund. You shouldn't derogate the product for something that is the fault of the shipping carrier, and possibly the packer.

There is a decent amount of flavor, and the price isn't bad. Maybe Thomas Keller would turn his nose up at it, but for me - it's good enough because honestly I can't tell the difference between the really expensive stuff and the mediocre stuff so I'd rather just pay $14, and not $90.
