review/text: I cant figure out why Gerber 2nd peas are so hard to find in the store...I see something green and its always green beans! We go through peas so much in my house with my child and this is the only way we are going to buy them from now on. The box is very compact and I just remove the top and leave stored them right in the box. It saves a ton of room in the kitchen, rather than having them tipping over in the cupboard.<br /><br />One surprising thing we also discovered is that our cat who has a low appetite loves this simple pea baby food too. It has been healthy for my baby and a real treat for my pet. Good stuff.

review/text: This is a great find for our family. First off, mixed vegetables is one of the best flavors of baby food. Its also sometimes hard to find in the stores near me that typically have a very meager selection. This eight pack takes care of our needs for a while, and everything comes neatly shipped in a compact little box that you can tear the top of and keep them all together. Every tub arrived and it had a really long expiration date. You cant go wrong!

While they have phased sodium benzoate out in England it is still used extensively in food here, particularly in diet soft drinks, syrups, etc. BOTH sodium dioxide and sodium benzoate are FDA approved, but the former is not potentially toxic while the latter is.

I was initially skeptical, but after one use I was hooked.  When I'm sick I use it to make a honey-lemon tea, and it is just as good as fresh-squeezed, only without the mess.  My only regret is that Trader Joe's has stopped carrying it!

review/summary: Just like fresh squeezed lemons
review/text: This is now one of my favorite "pantry" items!  I cook with fresh lemon juice very frequently and not only does it take time to squeeze enough fresh lemons to obtain the amount of juice I need, it can also be difficult to find high quality, fresh lemons and store them.  Reconstituted, concentrated lemon juice is simply not close to the flavor of fresh lemons so I was thrilled to find Sicilia.<br /><br />Its flavor is unmatched for recipes like chicken piccata or lemon sauce for artichokes.  Truly it tastes like someone picked fresh lemons from a tree in Sicily, squeezed the juice and delivered it to your door ready to use.

review/summary: Almost as Good as Fresh Squeezed Lemon Juice
review/text: This stuff is s-o-o-o-o much better than any other product I've tried. Indeed, the quality of this product can exceed the taste of fresh-squeezed lemon juice if you aren't careful about choosing your lemons. I've ordered fifteen or so over the last year or so and only one had a taste that was just a bit off. Again, I don't do better with lemons.<br /><br />It is important to note that some people can have a severe allergic reaction to the preservative in this product, sulpher dioxide. I did some research and found that while such reactions are quite rare, they can be very serious. As such I will add to my review a very serious caveat that people allergic to sulpher dioxide should avoid this product. I don't know whether the amounts of that substance in this product are sufficient to trigger such a reaction, but, certainly it is better to act with caution.<br /><br />What I absolutely can vouch for is the quality of the taste of this product which is nearly impossible to distinguish from freshly squeezed lemons.

review/text: I first found this cobbler mix in the local grocery store and used it to make a cobbler for a church picnic where I knew NO ONE. I figured if it was a flop, I was sorry, but I had to take something and this was quick and easy.<br />It has been a staple in my pantry since the first day I tried it in an anoynmous fashion (coward that I was!)! Soon people were asking "Who bought that great cobbler?" I tried it again, just to make sure and this time I dusted it with powdered sugar. It looked like it took a lot of work and went over wonderfully.<br />Now when I need something immediately, I pull out the cobbler mix and powdered sugar and off I go...to the potluck, or brunch, or even church picnic! This mix is a hit EVERYTIME! Give it a try. You'll be the cobbler queen in your group! And that is not a bad thing to be!! Absolutely recommended!

review/text: :) Well my honey recommended this for help in healing a freshly stitched up chainsaw induced wound. Well how sweet it is... it not only accelerated the process but helped take some of the sting out of the experience. I did not apply directly into the wound at first....just around the edges. I did this at night, covering up the sticky stuff with a large bandage tapped securely in place & left it on as i slept. After the wound closed i lightly applied it directly on it about every other day for a week.<br />My recovery was quick....so quick i did not need to use allot. Now i am in the next phase of my recovery, scar reduction & physical therapy & doing great. Proper wound management care is essential from day 1 until fully recovered as the better job you do the better your chances of a quick & complete recovery. So if you have your antennas out looking for something above & beeyond your standard remedy i recommend trying this sweet stuff & sticking to it :)

review/summary: Interests the picky and finicky
review/text: We have several oriental shorthair cats.  To say the least:  They are very particular about what they will eat (as in, pin their mouths and swallow).  Oh, they'll shred up and chew the toilet paper and I have to hide the cherry tomatoes because they love to roll them around for a while before they delight in squirting the juice out....but I think that is more about playing than eating.  Then, of course, they'll eat the Science Diet dog food, but I think they do that for the attention that particular "no, no!" elicits...<br /><br />We've gone through a lot of brands of cat food looking for something they will consistently eat.  We've tried other varieties of Royal Canin, Eukanuba, the top Purina varieties, even (in desperation)  Friskies and Meow Mix.  Becauses our cats are built slender and very muscular, I never felt comfortable serving cat food with a lot of fillers, but we wanted them to eat something, so that's why we tried grocery store brands.<br /><br />There are other "Selective" choices in this line of Royal Canin, but the "Aromatic Attraction" has worked very well for the adult cats for almost two years now.  And although we try to keep the kittens out of it, they like it too.

review/text: It's not easy to find sipping chocolate like this.  Trader Joe's sometimes carries similar sipping chocolate during the Christmas season, but one can find the Bellagio product throughout the year from Amazon and other online sources.  Although it comes in the same metal container and has a similar dark-chocolate flavor, the Bellagio sipping chocolate is not identical to Trader Joe's.  I like both products, especially when added to coffee, and feel they are quite similar in texture, color, and flavor.  I've been happy with Amazon's price and service, although my most recent order was delayed a few days because the item was out of stock (even though when I ordered it the site indicated that four tins were available).

review/summary: Incredible
review/text: This sauce is incredible. I have tried her Peanut Sauce as well and they are amazing. I went back and looked at the product description to see how it was made and I was amazed at how healthy this was and still tasted so good. I am very heath conscious and very restricted in what I can eat and I really love Thai cuisine. This sauce brings the best of both together. This lady has put a lot of effort into creating this without compromising the traditional Thai taste. I have traveled to Thailand many times and love to eat there, especially Chicken Satay, I could eat it daily. I find that some Thai food products or restaurants in the U.S.doesn't represent the true taste of Thai cuisine. I think its because so many ingredients are often replaced with domestic ingredients. This sauce brings you right back to Thailand. I had gotten a case after my first jar and shared it with my friends. Everyone loves it. I'm a fan forever.

review/summary: CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!!
review/text: This sauce is incredible! I ordered both of the different sauces (peanut and satay) because of its all natural healthy ingredients. My boyfriend, (who happens to be thai) was hesitant to try it at first because he says he can never find a sauce that met his standards, UNTIL THIS!! One day I came home from work excited to have it over some fried tofu and vegetables, to find that HE HAD EATEN THE ENTIRE THING!! We are both truly loyal customers now - we absolutely love this sauce, it is great on salads, with meats, vegetables or tofu - it really adds an addictive flavor to any dish. Also, the shipping is fast and reliable, and I have found that the price is well worth-it compared to what else is out there (especially with the free shipping that is offered). If you want the real deal, you cannot beat Wan's sauce. I would recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: Very generic tasting coffee
review/text: I love coffee, and tend to drink too much in the morning, making me feel too buzzed later on.  I wanted to give Green Mountain Roasters Half-Caff a try.  I enjoy their other coffees, but this one is not too flavorful.  You can tell the half-caff is there.  I didn't feel any type of caffeine buzz at all.  But the lack of flavor is what really turned me off.  Quite flat and had no sparkle.  I would equate it with drinking grocery store-brand decaf coffee.  It wasn't the worst, but definitely not great either.  Thanks goodness my new shipment of coffee came last night!  This was drinkable, but I would not buy it again, nor recommend it to someone who really likes a good, nutty, coffee flavor.  It wasn't there.

review/summary: Best on the Market!
review/text: I was born and raised in Philadelphia. I have tasted only one version of Snapper soup that was better. That was a frozen version produced by Campbell Soups during the 1960s. Having said that, Bookbinders' Snapper Soup is the best-tasting Snapper now available. The label instructs you to cut the contents with one-half can of water; I prefer to open two cans and warm the contents straight. The result is rich and thick with a flavourable base, filled with turtle meat, cooked egg white, and just the right mix of seasonings. Probably the best snapper soup on the market.

review/text: I am writing this after having eaten this soup for lunch.  Something has gone terribly wrong here.  I have enjoyed this soup quite frequently in the past.  Until fairly recently, this soup has been consistently good.  The taste was correct, just the right amount of sherry, and enough turtle to  satisfy my normally generous standards.  This last serving has prompted me to search the Internet for the source of the problem; no turtle and far too much tomato.  As I have alluded to earlier, this is not consistent with the past history of this product.  Something has gone very terribly wrong here...

review/summary: There is no turtle. None. What on earth happened?
review/text: There's something funny going on when your main soup ingredient is listed almost dead last on the list, right before caramel color. Three lumps of textured vegetable protein, no bigger than a fly... they're saying this is turtle? Are they using the water from a snapper's territory to make the broth? Looks like the supply of turtle meat has dried up.<br /><br />This soup is for all intents and purposes vegetarian, but with almost no protein. It's still somewhat tasty but without meat you're just having a bowl of gravy for lunch.

If you never had it before, it is sort of thick, rich,dark brown and obviously with chunks of turtle meat. Some recipes have carrots. Generally it is served with with a small flask of sherry. You add sherry to taste and wow...good eating. Of course the best snapper soup is Bookbinders. Bookbinders is a famous seafood restraunt in the city of Philadelphia and has been for like 100 years.

review/summary: Will not work based on animal behavior
review/text: Okay, basically this is not a good product based on simple logic and I really didn't want to give it any stars but Amazon makes you put at least one.<br /><br />Cats and dogs mark their territories with their scents, such as spraying/peeing on certain areas/objects and rubbing their bodies up against areas/objects.<br /><br />This stake is treated heavily with pheromones, which is a fancy word for smell.  Since each animal has their own smell, then this product is more likely to keep your pet from going anywhere near it.<br /><br />For this to actually work, the pheromones would have to be equivalent to that of your pet(s) and in high enough concentration for them to be drawn to it.  Like when a dog continuously pees in the same spot/area when you take them out on a walk (given that it is the same path).  Also, the same reason puppy pads (newspaper) and cat litter boxes work for training.  Plus, why you have to put a heavy duty odor eliminator on top of a spot that you have just cleaned when your pet makes a "mistake".  If you don't, then they will continue to go to that spot.<br /><br />Suggestion: If you really want your dog to go in just one place your best bet would be to collect your own dogs pee (don't forget to buy rubber gloves, a RubberMaid container w/ a lid, and possibly a face mask for the smell). Then soak some wooden stakes in it for a few days - the longer, the more the stakes will absorb, but watch that the stakes don't start to become too moist - w/ the lid on tight. After a few days, stake them in the spot you want your dog to use.  They will be attracted to the high concentration of their own scent and you shouldn't have to do it any more b/c they will go in that spot from then on.

I have seen her take one sniff of it in passing but has never done her business even close to the pee post.  Maybe this would work on puppies that have not been trained yet, but this did not work at all for my dog.

review/summary: This thing is magic
review/text: We just adopted an 11-month old and were having the hardest time getting him to pee outside, even after a whole night of his holding it while in his crate.  We were at the point of having to leave him outside for 30-60 minutes, just to be sure, unless we were lucky enough to see him go sooner than that while watching him from inside the house.<br /><br />I saw the Pee Post at our local pet store and thought it would be worth a shot.  I pounded it into the ground, brought our puppy out on a leash to sniff it, and he went immediately!  It's been several days now and it's worked every time:  bring him out, he pees right away, we get to go back inside and play!<br /><br />He's a terrier and terriers are pretty territorial while always trying to dominate other dogs, so maybe that's why it's so effective with him.  The product also points out that it is more effective with dogs "who have not established their marking patterns", which was the case with our guy...

review/summary: Don't waste your money
review/text: I bought this (not from Amazon, but just want to post a review to help)hoping to help out my 7-month old adopted lab puppy (who was kept outside and never housebroken at her last home) to pee outside. She was doing well without the post, but still has some accidents, so I wanted reinforcement to go outside.  Well, because I guess it smells like another dog, and she is totally a non-alpha dog and actually shy about intruding on other dogs' territory, it actually made her training go BACKWARDS. Now she is terrified to go in her "spot", and would rather go inside.  I hate this thing and am sending it back; I wouold give it 0 stars but they make me give at least 1. Maybe it would work with a more alpha dog, but beware if your dog is not.

review/summary: Pee Post - not a hit
review/text: I ordered the Pee Post with limited expectations, and was still disappointed.  My dog has not even sniffed the post, much less peed on it even with great encouragement. My comment is that since the area around the Pee Post is now green since he won't pee in the area of the post, maybe the product could be used for the opposite as advertised?

review/summary: I should have listened
review/text: I read the reviews, but thought that all I needed was a visual marker, so that I could train my dog to go there.  I read so many bad reviews, that I decided not to buy it online, however, I thought the people who said "the dog will pee anywhere but near the post" were exaggerating.<br /><br />So there I found myself, in Petco.  I asked for a toy hydrant (just a visual clue for training).  They said all they had was the pee post.  At that point, I figured it was the pee post, or nothing.  So I thought I'd take a chance.<br /><br />As you can tell by the 1 star review, I felt compelled to post my own review on amazon to save others who might eventually cave-in like I did.  Stay strong.  The other reviewers are not lying.<br /><br />I opened the package and was immediately overcome by the smell of pee.  You certainly do not have to be a dog, nor do you have to be near to smell that thing.  "Whoopee, this should work for sure."  After all, dogs hate the smell of other dog's pee, they feel compelled to pee over it.  My dog refuses to go near it to even smell the post.  They must have used pee (pheromones) from a super-aggressive dog, because my dog is conceding the yard to the post and now choses to pee elsewhere.<br /><br />I am thinking about washing the post in bleach and seeing if it has better results.

review/text: We got this for our 6 yr old lab who tends to pee all over our small city back yard killing what little grass we have. I am disappointed that he has no interest in the post at all. He thought it was a toy when we were putting it in and my 2 yr old shows more interest in it than him and I constantly have to keep her away from it. The post also has a strong smell of urine when u get it out of the box. I don't recommend it.

review/text: I tried this for my 6 month old Golden Retriever puppy because I was starting to see burn spots on my lawn and was hoping to "contain" the area where she was doing her business. NO LUCK WHATSOEVER. It was totally a waste of money. And, it turns out a little extra watering got rid of the spots...not to mention, she basically goes all over the lawn and not in one particular area. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

review/summary: This post really works, but there's something that helps quicken up the process!
review/text: Alright I just rescued a dog for our local animal shelter and I've had him now for a week. The first couple days he wouldnt eat or drink therefore he didn't really eliminate. I stuck this post in the backyard after waking up to puddles in the living room every morning even though we would let him out 5-6 times a day for 15-30 minutes each time to no prevail. So I stopped at a local Petsmart and picked this up. I also picked up Natures Miracle Housebreaking Spray which is the same pheromone that comes on the post, only more potent. I sprayed about a 15 ft radius around the post and the post pretty heavy itself. I then took him outside and introduced him to the post and at first he wasn't to excited. About 15 minutes later we went out again and he went right next to the post. I praised him and rewarded him with a treat and now he's going in the same radius outside near the post and he's even letting me know when he's ready to go out now. Without this post atleast instilling the idea of pheromones in the yard I'd still be cleaning up puddles, but that's not the case. I pretty much potty trained my dog in 1 day...pretty exciting if you ask me! I would definitely recommend this item even though I was a bit skeptical myself!

review/summary: Good Human Idea
review/text: The Simple Solution Pee Post is a good idea from a human perspective.  I inserted the post in a part of the yard that I wanted to be used as 'the' area and they didn't even sniff it as something new, let alone as an attractant.  The package lists about 'pee here' technology and descriptions list is a training device that "teaches your pet to urinate in a specific area of your yard".  NOT TRUE.  You can teach your dog to use it but you have to do just that...take the dog to the post until it goes, everytime you want it to go there, until it understands it is on the 'marking' route.  My dogs have this as one of many places in the yard that they use.  So it didn't work here and was a waste of my money.

I figure it's too late to return now, so I just threw it away, but I can not recommend it to anyone else.  I would give it zero stars if Amazon would let me.

She bought the stake in hopes it would correct the problem and she said it worked like a charm.  He now goes first thing by the stake and THEN he gets to go on is walk or play.  There have been no indoor accidents since she started using the stake.
