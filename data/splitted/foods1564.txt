review/summary: Gives my dog terrible diarrhea
review/text: After reading the ingredients (and being familiar with Paul Newman's great-tasting salad dressings), I was excited about feeding this dog food to my older rescue doberman.<br /><br />I was surprised when I opened the first can because it truly looked like it had been eaten and passed through another dog's intestines.  Sorry to be so graphic but that's the truth.  It's hard to give my dog food that I dont even want to touch.  She loved the taste, though, and that was the important thing.<br /><br />That night, however, my poor dog was in agony and had black, watery diarrhea all over the house.  Twenty-four hours later she still wasnt feeling well.  I gave her Imodium and considered taking her to the vet.<br /><br />I'm happy for those dogs that like this food and dont suffer any side-effects.  I wish my dog were one of them.

review/summary: Great food--dented cans happen too often!!
review/text: This is great, healthy food---the only food my dogs (Cav. Spaniel and Spaniel mix) can eat w/o stomach issues. Many other premium foods are just too rich!!  The dented can issue has never required me to return the food, but it happens too often and is very annoying!  I would never feed my dogs anything else and no one here carries this particular food, so I am very thankful that Amazon sells it.

review/summary: Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice Dog Food
review/text: This is quality dog food and my 9 year old cocker spaniel loves it.  She has more energy and is more alert.  I give her half of a 5.5 ounce can each morning and the other half in the evening.  I also give her Newman's dry dog food twice a day. It's expensive but our darling pets deserve the best.

review/summary: too rich for my dog, gave her black poo
review/text: I found this food to be too rich for my 25 lb cockapoo.  It gave her really black tarry poop which im guessing is because the food is high in Iron.  I just didnt feel comfortable with the color of her stool.  It returned to normal as soon as I stopped giving it to her.  I think the liver content is too high for an every day food.  It might be ok to give 1-2 times a month but thats it.  I even mixed the food with fresh veggies.  It didnt work for us.

review/text: My dog Annie has a health condition by the name of Megaesophagus,  anyone interested in learning about this can find information on the internet.  We had got to the point where we did not know what to feed her.<br /><br />Her regular dog food would get incapsulated in the slime, and she would vomit it all up including the slime. This food is high in protein and calories I add enough water to it and mix it well to where it passes through to her stomach.<br /><br />She has two meals a day  and thanks to finding this food I did not have to put her to sleep.  (Her condition had got that bad)

review/text: This is an excellent dog food. My dog just had IVD surgery and has been on the canned dog food - chicken and brown rice. Not only does my dog love it, but he does not have problems with his bowels (like he does on other canned 'wet' dog foods). His stools are still solid (although softer) and I can mix the food with water, since my dog is in need of more water in his diet. I love the product, although much pricier than other canned food, but well worth it. No problems whatsoever.

review/summary: my dogs love this food!
review/text: First, I feed my dogs fresh raw food I make into patties and frez, each morning they eat one frozen,and I give them Fish oil, Garlic and Klamath shores Blue Green Algae caps. Then at night I give Newmans Chicken can food and mix in their Probiotic Miracle & Enzymes and Plaque off. Then they always have their dry food (Taste of the wild, grain free)anytime they are still hungery.<br /><br /> My 2 big dogs are very healthy at 8 years old, hardly get fleas anymore, I don't use chemical flea or heartwormer products anymore, as one dog had a bad reaction to them and lost most of his hair and had hot spots for two years. Then nat. path vet said my other vet should not have given him the yearly vacinations,which also caused the problems. He went on a 10 week detox after that.)<br /><br />For the alternative heartwormer I do 1 week each mo. I give my dogs Natures sunshine Artemisia Combination 2 in the morning, 1 at night with 1 BlackWalnut. then 2 times that week I will give them 1 HS2. I give these about 20 min. before I give them morning food. Then at night before bed. My dogs weights are 100 and 70. The dog that had allergey, I also would give him first thing in the morning, before eating, Transfer factor, or colostrum, also everyother day a kelp tablet, which I think helped the hair grow back in. I used emu oil with lavender oil and tea tree oil mixed in, on the hot spots. Also for the ears, I used Zymox, OTIC Enzymatic Solution. it worked great.<br /><br />Hope this info helps someone.

They were even hard to open with the can opener.  I will still get my subscribed monthly order, but if it happens again I will probably cancel it.  I have no problems with the quality of the product, just very dissatisfied with the way it was mailed.

review/summary: All flavors repeatedly make my dog terribly sick
review/text: At first, I thought my toy schnauzer had gotten into something that made her very sick but I took her off the Newman's Own anyway just to be safe (a decision made by my vet and I after I took her into the ER that night). I decided to try again a few days ago because it appears to be an excellent food (ingredient-wise) and we hadn't pinpointed the specific problem but, yet again, it wasn't even an hour before she was horribly sick and the effects of one feeding have lasted for days (Thank God I have medication left over from our last trip! I'm trying to avoid another vet visit but we're not in the clear yet). Even the stray cats on the block won't touch it and they pretty much eat anything. Definitely won't be trying it again.

review/summary: We Both Love It
review/text: My Husky/Samoyed mix, The Lovely Marie, adores this food. As soon as I open a can, she starts dancing in circles. I think she especially loves the smell of it, although that occasionally puts me off a bit because it does contain fish. Some cans are stinkier than others, but it's all perfume to Marie's nose. She gobbles it up. I do vary her diet to include some grain-free products, but this is the food she gets most excited about.<br /><br />I love it because I trust this company, and I believe that Newman's Own products are of high quality. (I hope I'm right.) I also like their mission to bring good green and fair trade products to the market, and to use their profits to support charitable causes. Bottom line: I feel confident that I am giving my girl something wholesome and good.<br /><br />I stock up on this food because the chicken they put in it is "human grade." I hope the fish is "human grade," too, because I have several cases of this in my garage. I'm thinking that when the "Big One" (earthquake) hits here in California, I'll just break out a case of this food and Marie and I can both survive on it until help arrives.

review/summary: My Yorkies love this stuff!
review/text: After researching the ingredients on my dogs' old dog food (Beneful & Cesars),I wanted to get my pups on some healthier food and I also did not want to break the bank doing so. This turned out to be a great alternative that met all my nutritional and financial requirements I had set forth. For a well rounded nutritional meal, I mix the following <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK339Y">Newman's Own Organics Chicken & Brown Rice Formula for Dogs, 12.7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PMDYZA">Newman's Own Organics 100% Organic Liver for Dogs, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK33C6">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a>. The dogs really go nuts for this stuff and seem to enjoy it. It appears to me that the dogs have more energy and are in an overall better mood. One of Yorkies had a licking issue and that behavior has decreased dramatically since I made the switch to Newman's. It keeps their stool very solid as well. Overall this a great, nutritional meal at a good price......5 STARS!

review/summary: Turkey and Chicken Formula smells like fish
review/text: Unless you read the fine print, you won't know that "Turkey & Chicken Formula" actually contains turkey, chicken AND whitefish.  Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as "contaminated".  After just a single 5.5 oz can, my dog had a serious case of fish breath and by the next day was occasionally passing fishy-smelling gas.  Don't get me wrong---my dog loved this food, and I have read enough reviews to be satisfied that it's very good quality.  I have no doubt he would love to gobble down more of this (and I've got another 23 cans to get through), but I don't think my family will appreciate more of the fishy smell.

review/summary: Too Rich for my dogs
review/text: I think this is a very good food but as little as I fed daily (about 1 tablespoon) to my dobie and Dogue de Bordeaux, they both had terrible gas and then went into diarrhea, making several trips outside in a panic more than 5x's a night. They were kind enuf to wake me up! I can use it a couple of times a week and that is it. I think if you buy the Newmans's chicken/rice organic canned and the plain beef and mix them up once in a while it would be better, but feeding the "organ" meat daily is a mistake. Maybe your dog will be fine with it, but be careful. My little shih tzu had no problems, but just like the BARF diet they generally only feed organ meats a few x's a week and maybe this was my mistake. So personally I feel it is a good food, just be careful as it is much richer than most any other canned food you will feed and a tablespoon goes a long way!

I went through a real struggle when one of them got a stomach bug and got real sick with vomiting and diarrhea.  I started cooking fresh turkey with brown rice and his stomach healed up in no time.  But them I couldn't get them back onto dog food!!  I found the Newman's Organic Turkey and Brown Rice formula and they LOVE it.  I still give them a good quality dry food for little snack times.  However, they usually wait for their turkey and rice and gobble it up.  They have lots of energy and for the last two months have not gotten tired of the food.  I think we have found a keeper!

review/summary: Good food but...
review/text: I do think this is a good food.  However, it is just too mushy to serve alone.  I give the feline version to my cats and they love it, but cats don't mind a softer food.  We give our little poodle canned food for the low carbs and since our cats love Newmans we thought we would try it for him.  First I got it in the big cans, which is enough for 2 days for Joey and I was OK with that.  The first can I used was OK, not great, but OK when I opened the can and gave him the top 3 ounces.  His dinner with the second 3 ounces wasn't as good.  Next day it was even mushier in the second half of the can.  I liked the food though and he did well on it so I ordered the smaller cans to see if there would be a difference there.  I used half of a can this morning for his breakfast and it was OK, but not stiff enough to make it easy for me to chop up and him to eat.  I am going to use this food as a mixer with his Tiki dog food until it is used up and then I don't think I will buy it again.  I don't get it either because it is the same 78% moisture as his California Natural and By Nature dog food but it just doesn't hold up.  I will continue to give it to my cats in their rotation, but little Joey will be sticking to his other good foods.

review/text: OK, I admit, if this hadn't been offered during an Amazon lightning deal I would not have bought it due to the high price.  However, this morning I opened a can to use for one of my dog's medicines.  Each of our three dogs got one-third of a can.<br /><br />And oh my, all three woofed it down and waited for more.  Even the cat chimed in and wanted some.  My dogs don't get this excited over canned Pedigree, which is what I usually feed them as a supplementary food source.<br /><br />Although the pureed liver comes out of the can looking and feeling like something that comes out of the back end of a dog, it doesn't smell offensive.  I'm just not used to these more organic ingredients:  liver, beef broth, minerals and vitamins.  This is definitely something I will buy more often for special meals.<br /><br />Interestingly, this product comes from Uruguay.

review/text: My sister was visiting with her 2 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels when my dog Jake, a Golden Retriever Mix, had an opportunity to "sample" their Newman's Own dog food while they weren't looking, He loved it; so I bought it at my local grocery store. Amazon's pricing, especially using the "subscription" is so much lower than the grocery store. I don't have to think about it, it just arrives every month.

review/text: We have a toothless older small dog and this is perfect for him to eat since he licks his food and this is healthy for him too and cheaper than the canned foods at the vets and other places! So hard to find soft/canned food that our dogs like and our other dog has upset stomack troubles and with this she doesn't get sick if she eats late in the day and loves it. Our dogs are so picky too. This is great!

review/summary: Healthy food that my dog loves
review/text: My dog LOVES this food. I have spent hours researching healthy dog food and my vet recommended Newman's Own. I had her on a freeze dried raw food diet which was just horrible on my pooch's tummy and my vet warned of the dangers of a raw food diet (she has seen kidney failure in dogs) - thank goodness I switch food.  My dog is a picky eater and this food she keeps on loving.

review/summary: makes a fat dog thin
review/text: I bought a case just to try out on my wiener dog, Oscar.  He has lost weight.  Now he is much more energetic and can jump higher which means he can get into more trouble.  Before going up stairs was slow and sometimes I had to wait. Now he is the first up the stairs just like the old days.  Keeping weight off of Dachshunds is very important for their back.  It costs a little more but I think I will make it up in vet bills and also have my buddy around for a longer period.<br />Doesn't have that dog food smell and you can actually see the ingredients.

review/summary: Glad we tried, has made a difference
review/text: My family rescued a pug mix from a shelter a couple months ago.  We used the puppy food they gave us and then matched the brand at our local store later.  A couple months went by, wouldn't say our dog didn't like her cheap dog food, but she did develop demodex and a whole new world about dogs and health opened up to us.  Bottom line, we were feeding her, but our vet compared it to us eating spaghettios every day for every meal for life.<br /><br />Demodex is not contagious but inherited and a skin disorder we had to treat.  We talked to our vet about her immune system and how we would want to keep her as healthy as possible during treatment and after.  While he didn't really recommend any particular brand, he did encourage us to educate ourselves about what's out there.<br /><br />After some research and with the idea that we buy Newman's Own brand foods for our human selves, we ordered the dry kibble and mixed it with the active dog and puppy formula canned food they make as well.  Our dog does love this food, and clearly prefers the canned to the her old cheap foil top square packages we'd pick up each grocery visit.  We have noticed that her fur, while always been soft, has become thick and buttery soft when you pet her.<br /><br />I know the vet warned us that the treatment might have adverse effects, but she has been fine.  I credit a healthier diet for getting her through this.  And it clearly has done wonders for her skin and coat.  Added bonus, the food actually smells good with minimal odor as opposed to the cheapy stuff which made me gaggy.

review/text: I feed my dog nothing but Newman's products.  Before I got her from a bunch of college kids she had subsisted on cheap dog food and cheap fast food.  Did she wolf down the Newman's the first time I gave it to her? No.  Just like us, it took time to retrain her palate and appreciate the lack of salt and msg, artificial flavors and colors, and to relearn better eating habits.  Two years down the road, she is allergy free, healthy, energetic and has a beautiful coat.<br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I have this on automatic shipping once a month.  It's great to have a case of dog food on hand to jazz up the kibble.  We board labs and goldens in our home so sometimes dogs need a little something extra to make the food special enough to eat.  This does the trick.  And it's a high quality canned dog food too.  Far better than carting a case or even 1/2 dozen cans from the supermarket.  Love having it shipped right to my door, having it discounted and no shipping charge through Subscribe and Save.

review/text: I was very excited to find this product, having really enjoyed Newman's Own products in the past and coming to trust them.  I am also a firm believer in feeding the best grain free diet to my Labs, and 95% organic beef went well with that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the product is disgusting.  The consistency of what comes out of the can is disturbing.  Try to imagine dried out peanut butter that is impossible to separate or spread.  No amount of water that I added would allow me to use a fork (and knife) to try to separate the product and mix it with my dry kibble.<br /><br />Instead, I am trying the new Castor & Pollux Organix Grain Free product, and hoping for the best.<br />[...]

review/text: OK, for those that think they may be buying a grain free product, DON'T BUY THIS.  My yellow lab is bad with any grains and causes her to have asthma attacks (really, really bad attacks).  Tried this first time last night and she woke up coughing and wheezing.  WTF I thought and sure enough, it has oat bran in it.  My stupid dumb ***, I trust Newman's to have a product accurately reflecting the products on the label.  Brown rice and chicken aren't oats.  I guess my lesson learned is trust no one and read all the labels (actually did before i bought, must have missed it though). I didn't miss it,but Amazon has proven they are wonderful when it comes to taking care of their customers if they feel there was an error or communication problem.  I will continue to use Amazon for most of my shopping, given the incredible value of unlimited 2 day shipping for $75/year

Amazon replace order, came UPS this time instead of USPS, air pillows were again torn and flat, but only one can barely dented,...Also, i opened one of the dented cans from the first order, bad smell and food was pulled away from the sides, so take care with dented cans of dog/cat food

review/text: On my road to eating organic with No High Fructose, No Preservatives or Chemicals Thereof.<br /><br />This is the closest thing to perfection when it comes to choosing a natural peanut butter. There are few companies out there that compare to this product. This one is simply the best, especially when considering the price!<br /><br />FYI:<br /><br />When buying natural peanut butter, Separation Occurs Naturally. I'm sure you knew that ahead of time, if not, don't get discouraged. I have found the solution that solves this problem.<br /><br />Solution:<br /><br />Simply turn the Jar upside down in the refrigerator. Keep flipping the Jar (Inside the frig) until the oil vanishes. Voil&agrave;, that's it.<br /><br />You don't even have to stir it. The refrigerator will keep the oil from separating again as well.

review/summary: Excellent Natural Choice for Peanut Butter
review/text: It is difficult for me to find natural (sugar free) peanut butter at a good price. After looking on Amazon for awhile I came across this brand and the price was OK so I gave it a shot. Taste is excellent, with fresh peanut flavor. Very good consistency, more peanuts than most (Teddy's, Smuckers, Jif Natural, etc.) I did not think that the separation was really extreme, like the others have been for me. I keep it in the fridge and it still spreads remarkably well for me. Overall a good choice and a reasonable (somewhat) price.

review/summary: Great ~ BUT
review/text: This peanut butter is very tasty ~ BUT.  As with the majority of natural peanut butters, this one has to be stirred when it is first opened to redistribute the oils.  This particular peanut butter doesn't seem to have enough oil, which means when you're about halfway through the jar, the peanut butter is like concrete - very unspreadable.  I am on my third jar of the 4-pack, and it is like this every time, even after many minutes of stirring.  It still tastes good, so if you're eating it right out of the jar, that might not be a problem.  I spread it on toast, and spreading concrete is very challenging!  So, this peanut butter would get 5 stars for flavor and ingredients, but I took two stars off for spreadability.

I'd never heard of this brand but read the reviews and decided to take a chance.  Overall it's excellent - not too salty, not too bland.  Just pure peanuts.  I didn't have the issue with the bottom of the peanut butter turning into "concrete" but I keep mine in the refrigerator after I open it...that seems to keep the oils better distributed.<br /><br />I will purchase this again... highly recommended.

Use a little elbow grease to stir it up well when you first open it - I recommend placing it in the sink to facilitate cleanup and provide leverage - and then store it upside down.

review/text: Peanuts and salt. That is the ingredients. It tastes fantastic. I had been searching for a "healthy" peanut butter and was having so much trouble finding something that was bearable to take down let alone delicious. Look no further. I have not found anything else that even comes close. Since there are not the preservatives that come in normal peanut butter this will settle and stirring the top every time you use it will not be enough. If in the upright position for a long time the oils will go to the top and essentially leave a dry packed area of PB that is unbearable. I find that storing it upside down until I am ready for it usually does the trick however I will still take a metal knife and stir it really good otherwise the lower 1/6 of the container would be unusable.

review/text: This peanut butter is so much better than ordinary supermarket peanut butter, that it should have a new name so it's not confused with normal PB&J spread.  I was doubtful that it could be much different the first time I tried it, but wow, was I wrong!  It really is THAT good!.  I am so glad that I was able to find it on Amazon.com, but it's good enough to be worth the trip to Williamsburg.

review/summary: Natural peanut taste - not sweet
review/text: If you like the pure peanut taste, this product is excellent. Instead of being solid, it is semi-liquid because it is not processed with the chemicals that make most peanut butter solid. I like the taste very much, because it it not sweet like most commercial peanut butter.

review/summary: Is It Possible To Get Excited Over Spam?
review/text: With Bacon Spam the answer is yes.  As far as I'm concerned they can simply discontinue all over spam varities. Bacon spam has a much more meaty and slightly smokey flavor that brings Spam up several notches in my opinion.<br /><br />You can of course use it in any way you normally use regular spam but perhaps one of my favorite ways to have it is to cube it up and cook it in with navy beans or in split pea soup.<br />I am not a fan of the hot spam or the hickory spam that tastes a bit odd to me. If I were to describe the flavor for you it would be.  Bacon spam doesn't taste exactly like bacon.  It is more like they mixed 20% bacon in with regular spam.  It is hard to find this variety in stores.  I have only seen it a the Mega-Walmarts and here on Amazon.  Enjoy!

review/summary: "SPAM" The other red meat.
review/text: This stuff is yummy in the tummy.  Get some. It tastes like bacon.  I'm glad I am not a Muslim because they probably can't eat this stuff.  That is a good thing.  That leaves more for me.  Ha ha.  I have this set up on the automatic order system through Amazon.com  That makes the price a dollar or two cheaper.  It also makes it convenient for me so that I can keep my canned goods rotating.  Instead of ordering or purchasing large quantities that all have the same expiration date on them I will keep getting new stock with fresh dates on them.  I have my system set up for every two months so I will get 6 fresh cans at a time.  This is just one of the ways that I am staying prepared for emergencies.  Don't get caught with your pantry empty.  History could repeat itself so do some little things to help make sure that you will have a little food stored for the unexpected.<br />By the way I slice this up and fry it in the skillet.  It really does smell and taste like bacon.<br />I think I bought some at Sam's Club once but when I went back for more they did not have it.<br />Wal-Mart didn't have it either.<br />What I do is open the can and extract the meat from inside carefully.  I make at least 8 equal slices.  Thinner is better but I find that I like uniformity in my slice.  I spray the skillet lightly with some non stick spray.  Turn the burner on high and wait a minute or two for it to get hot. Place the slices in the pan for 4 or 5 minutes and turn the heat back to medium high.  Flip them over and brown both side.  If either side isn't uniformly brown flip again until it is just right.<br />Cooking them this way will reduce the fat content a little.  It adds a lightly crisp texture and a cooked meat flavor.  I like to eat them just like that out of the pan.  I also like to put two slices between bread with a little mustard.

review/summary: SPAM with less salt and a hint of bacon
review/text: I think this is the best SPAM ever.  The protein, fats, and carbs are the same as "SPAM Classic", but it is not as salty.  (Classic is 790mg and Bacon is 520mg per serving.)  The flavor is good and there is just a hint of bacon.<br /><br />Since SPAM Classic and the Walmart "Luncheon Meat" are both canned in the same factory (199N), I will compare those also for reference.  I think the SPAM brand has better flavor and texture, but the Walmart brand has zero reported carbs per serving where SPAM is one, probably from the added sugar.  This may be of interest for one on a low-carb diet.  After frying (or cauterizing as some say), they all give nice tasty semi-crispy patties.<br /><br />Other thoughts: Even though I got SPAM Bacon on a good deal here, the "best by" date is thirty-six months away, so I did not get old stock.

review/summary: Pretty tasty, but TOO EXPENSIVE!!
review/text: I never even tried Spam until about a year ago, when I had my first taste of Spam with bacon. I was shocked by how much I liked it (though I can't say I taste a whole lot of bacon in it...) As someone who lives in the middle of nowhere and can only get to the grocery store once a month, I am always trying to find good items which do not need refrigeration until they are opened, and so I was really happy to have discovered this product.<br /><br />I bought a case (of 6, not 12) on Amazon for $12 and change on subscription, and have purchased it numerous times since. But now this product is more than $20!!!! That is $3.38 per pound for SPAM?! That's more than Spam costs at the most expensive grocery store in my area, and being in the middle of nowhere, food prices are even HIGHER here than anywhere else. WHAT ARE THEY THINKING???? This is supposed to be a protein source for people on TIGHT budgets, not wealthy people! This is even more expensive than the GOOD packaged ham at our expensive grocery store. And this price reflects the 15% discount you get when you subscribe to an item. The cost of this is INSANE. Guess I'll just have to find a way to pack a ham in my refrigerator once a month. More protein and less fat, not a bad thing.

review/summary: How can you not like spam?
review/text: Okay, so it's not exactly healthy for you but it is affordable, delicious, versatile, and the shelf life really helps for us single guys living on a budget. I keep at least a few cans for those just in case days. Try some of these uses:<br /><br />-Spam Musubi: seawead, rice, terikyaki sauce, and spam. Roll it up like square sushi. Dip it in sirachi/teriyaki sauce. I think it tastes better with thinner 1/4 inch spam slices seared on both sides but that is a matter of preference.<br /><br />-In place of bacon: The name really stands true but you have to cook it much longer to get that bacon flavor. Cut it really really think (like 1/8 inch) and cover it on a medium fire. Once the fat burns out it will cook a lot faster. Wait until it gets crispy.<br /><br />-Fried rice: If you slice it into thin half inch squares you can use it for fried rice. Use day old cooked rice so it doesn't clump together. Reheat the rice in the pan and put some soy sauce in there. In a separate pan cook some vegetables, the spam, and scrambled eggs last. Throw the eggs and other ingredients in with the rice when the eggs are still runny. Add some salt and pepper for taste and you have yourself a meal.<br /><br />Hope this gives you some ideas :)

review/summary: Tasty with OK nutrition if you're careful
review/text: I've been buying Spam products from Amazon over the past year. I tend to favor Spam Turkey, With Bacon, and With Cheese, so my commentary focuses on these three. Each of these three can be fairly tasty depending on the exact use. When Amazon's pricing dips below $15, then it beats pricing at my local supermarket. Above $15, and I start checking out my local sales.<br /><br />An obvious consideration with Pam is its nutritional value, or possible lack there of. So I looked up some of the relevant nutritional information, some of which I will repeat here. You should consider doing the same.<br /><br />Each can of Spam holds 12 ounces, or six servings (in Hormel's estimation). Each serving of Turkey Spam has 80 calories. The bacon and cheese versions have 180 and 170 calories, respectively.<br /><br />A serving of Turkey Spam has 4.5 grams of total fat and 1.5 grams of saturated fat. The numbers for Bacon Spam are 16 and 6 grams. And for Cheese Spam, the numbers are 15 and 6 grams. The recommended daily reference values are 65 and 20 grams.<br /><br />A serving of Turkey Spam has 35 mg of cholesterol while the others have 40 mg of cholesterol. The recommended daily value is 300 mg.<br /><br />A serving of Turkey Spam And Bacon Spam have 520 mg of sodium. Cheese Spam has 720 Mg. The recommended daily value is 2400 mg.<br /><br />Essentially this means that Turkey Spam is healthier than the others, but any of these versions of Spam can fit into a nutritious program SO LONG AS you limit the servings and don't use a lot of fatty oil if you fry your servings. If you insist on eating a whole can every day, you will tend to be fat with clogged arteries and high blood pressure.<br /><br />I don't fry my Spam although it's tempting to do that a slice at a time for breakfast. Instead, I tend to use Turkey Spam diced in pasta salads and sliced for sandwiches. The cheese and bacon versions have a more distinctive taste, and I use them mostly to add some meat to the Betty Crocker mashed potatoes that I also buy from Amazon.<br /><br />Of course, Spam IS very tasty and when fried is always a winner with kids. As long as they don't gorge themselves on it, it should be fine. In the end, the key with Spam as with many other foods is to be moderate and balanced in what you eat.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

review/text: Don't get me wrong, I like Spam, because.....well, its Spam. I don't eat it much these days, but if you served it to me with eggs for instance, I would probably gobble it down.<br /><br />Now, let's play a game. I am going to list a whole lot of ingredients and you are going to tell me what is missing from the list. OK? Here goes:<br />-Pork With Ham,<br />-Bacon Fat,<br />-Water,<br />-Modified Potato Starch,<br />-Salt,<br />-Sugar,<br />-Sodium Nitrite.<br /><br />Ding, ding, ding! Times up.<br /><br />If you said "Bacon (Cured With Water, Salt, Sugar, Dextrose, Sodium Erythorbate, Sodium Nitrite)", you'd be correct! Smarty pants!<br /><br />After all, when you already have pork, ham and bacon fat, why not throw in bacon as well? The only thing you could add after that is the pig's foot or snout, or maybe an entire baby suckling pig.<br /><br />So hurray for Spam with Bacon. Its complete.

review/text: Was recommended this product by my acupuncturist to help with sleep and to keep the body 'regular.' Been taking Natural Calm Plus Calcium for 3 nights now. I am a small person, so only started with a half a teaspoon. I put it in Decaf Green Tea and take it before bed. It tastes fine, a little sweet. Now it's Day 3, and I don't know if this is one of those products that require 8 hours of sleep, but I feel foggy and exhausted, and have that 'sleeping pill' feeling, like I took a sleep aid but didn't sleep enough. (I sleep about 7 hours a night.) It's really not pleasant.<br />Am willing to try it some more, and will also be trying just the 'plain' Calm without the Calcium, Potassium, and Boron. Maybe those are messing with my head, not sure. Yesterday afternoon I was feeling funny, nauseous and also foggy in the head. I will say that I am sleeping more soundly at night, but to wake up feeling this groggy, and to have it last well into the morning is not fun. I will be testing more, but it seems to be doing funny things to me.

review/summary: Fibromyalgia
review/text: I had been enduring an agonizing week-long episode of what appears to be a fibromyalgic Tetany Syndrome of excruciating pain radiating from hip-joint to knee-joint along the muscles between the joints. In trying to describe to myself the electro-convulsive nature of it, I said it appeared to be like a fibrillation - only deep in my hip, and immediately the word "magnesium" popped into my mind. Dunno why.<br /><br />Tottered out to kitchen and One teaspoon of Natural Calm and 20 minutes later the convulsive constant spasms stopped. I was free from pain and able to sleep. Have had to keep a steady repeated dosage to keep the spasms at bay and it is difficult to admit that I probably have Fibromyalgia, but thank God for a remedy to the pain.<br /><br />I've kept the Natural Calm in my cupboard because of a peculiar muscle flutter/twitch I would get around the eyes when magnesium levels were low. Know this is just an anecdotal tale, but screaming pain one moment and no pain 20 minutes later, only difference being the magnesium is a tale that needs to be told.

review/text: I purchased Natural Vitality's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE">Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon 16 oz</a> as a magnesium supplement to help me absorb calcium better because I was diagnosed with osteopenia--precursor to osteoporosis.  I will have to wait until my next bone density test in about a year and a half to find out if adding this readily absorbed magnesium product has helped my bones.  In the mean time, however, it has helped with my chronic constipation.  I had been using stool softeners for the past couple of years and this works much better.  It is a powder which you mix in a cup of hot water and stir.  I usually take 5 grams (a heaping teaspoon) once a day.  After it is dissolved, I add a little cold water so I can drink it quickly, although it does taste good.

review/summary: Tasty & effective
review/text: I really like this particular magnesium supplement. In ice cold water it tastes much like lemonade! It helps with minor muscle aches, headaches, and constipation. Just don't take too much! Start out with a 1/2 tsp and you can gradually increase it, and you'll know when you've found the right amount for your body.

review/text: In the stressful world we live in it's nice to relax with a warm cup of Natural Calm Magnesium at the end of the day - I get better results with this product than any magnesium pill I've tried.  My kids love it too and say it helps them fall asleep faster.  Arrived quick, and a better price than at the local store!
