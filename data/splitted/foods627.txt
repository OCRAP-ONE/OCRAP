review/summary: Survival food?
review/text: I bought a case of this as part of my canned survival food storage. Needless to say it tastes awful and won't order anymore. I love molasses but for some reason I just can't stomach this. I was hoping it'd be a "canned comfort food" for a survival situation, but the only comfort would be not opening it in the first place.<br /><br />There's so many more options ouch there, canned bread is just not a good idea.

review/text: These are amazing! Sweet, crunchy and satisfying. It may seem like alot to buy, but they go fast! *********WARNING: The best place to store this product is in the bag it comes in! The bag must be specially designed to keep out moisture. I kept some in a ziplock bag and the rest in the bag they came in (just clipped it closed with a binder clip) and the ones in the ziplock bag got soft pretty quickly, but the ones in the bag that they came in stayed crunchy and are still crunchy.

review/summary: Decent but not my personal favorite
review/text: These apples are true to how they're advertised and what I expected from the other reviews I read. They are pretty crispy and easy to eat. I personally like the flavor and texture of slightly-chewy dried apples better, so 2 pounds is a lot for me to get through. If you prefer crispy dried apples through, these are for you. I understand what another reviewer meant by a "musty" flavor in some of the chips; it makes them a little less appealing though not inedible and I think it's just the nature of the product.

review/summary: Could use some package labeling
review/text: This was my first try with organic dried apples.  I have decided to avoid pesticide ridden fresh and dried apples.  When the package arrived I was a little disturbed at the lack of labeling of any kind.  They were identified as Bare Fruit Fuji Apples packaged for Amazon, with an address for Bare Fruits. Weight one pound. That was it.  No use by date, or any kind of a freshness indicator. No ingredients list, though I assume the ingredients are just apples.  But how can I know for sure?  They came in a sturdy silver mylar type bag, very well padded for shipping.  I haven't come up with a way to reclose the bag for freshness.  Even my vacuum sealer system, which works on most mylar bags will not reseal this one.  My first try at the chips themselves was a little disappointing.  Many of the pieces were almost too small for munching.  The taste and texture was foreign to me.  But then a little later in the day I was surprised that I wanted more.  Maybe taste buds just need a chance to get accustomed to a new thing.  Now I love them. The Fuji taste comes through beautifully,  They are slightly crunchy without being hard straight from the bag.  I have also thrown a handful in in place of other fruit when making oatmeal in the morning.  When added in the last minute or so of cooking, they come out plump and flavorful.  My husband is taking them instead of potato chips with his lunch and finds them to be a satisfying mid afternoon snack. I am now thinking of other ways to try them, both rehydrated and dry.  Maybe in muffins?  Rehydrate in maple syrup to use on pancakes?  Or could I use them as an alternative to peeling and slicing apples for pie?  Two one pound bags is alot of apples, and since I don't know how long they will stay fresh I am ready to explore.

There was no musty taste in any of my bags, (I bought 4 1# packages).  They taste exactly the same as what I buy in the smaller snack packages from the grocery store.  This is a great product, sweet and crunchy, and WAY less expensive to purchase this way.

review/summary: A Quality Product
review/text: A very good tasting dried apple. They retain the Fuji flavor and are quite sweet. I mostly use them in my cooked cereal and they plump up nicely and add a nice flavor. They are cut thinner and are more crispy and less chewy than the dried apples I used to take on camping trips, but with the lower moisture content they are more economical. The apples are well packaged and should stay fresh for a long time unopened. I have had no trouble keeping the opened package fresh by folding over the top of the original package and placing it in a gallon size freezer bag. I am on my second order and signed up for a subscription (additional discount and free shipping).

review/summary: Great or me and my dog!
review/text: I accidentally ordered these when looking for apple chips like Pannera Bread serves on Fuji apple salads. As soon as I placed the order I thought they were the wrong product and tried to cancel it, but was not able to.  I then ordered a case of apple chips, which were delicious, but full of sugar and calories. I ate the chips and had these left.<br /><br />I was surprised when I opened the bag to find that these are exactly what I was looking for.  They are not the thick, chewy dried apples that I thought they were.  They are thin and crispy, but without added fat or sugar.  I am enjoying them as a snack, stirred into oatmeal and tossed into salads.  I am also using them as low calorie, inexpensive and healthy dog treats, where they are a big hit.<br /><br />Some of the chips are medium and some broken into not much more than crumbs, but it is easy to pull out the size you need for your current use. They are all smaller and thicker than the apple chips I bought.<br /><br />According to the information I have been able to find, there are 29 calories in 1/4 cup (12 grams) and no fat.  The shelf life is one year, but there are no "use by" dates on the bags.<br /><br />I am very happy to eat my "mistake" and will gladly order these again.

review/summary: I can't describe how much I love these apple chips!
review/text: I don't eat flour or sugar products so my choices are quite limited. Plus, I have many chemical sensitivities. I use an ounce of these chips with frozen fruit I whip into a smoothie-like substance and it's pure nirvana!<br /><br />I know people have complained about a musty smell or flavor. Well, maybe it's because I don't eat much processed food, but these chips are so sweet and fulfilling for a snack-type food and I would definitely have noticed such a smell.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because I do think I have a slight reaction to them (eczema that worsens if I use them too many days in a row).<br /><br />But getting the bulk price has saved me a fortune. They are close to $4 for an ounce in Publix or Whole Foods.

review/summary: Tasty, but are like crumbs!
review/text: I've been buying Bare Fruit's dried granny smith apples from Costco for a while now-large 14oz bag was less than $5. I bought 4-6 at a time because, just like Costco, they're known to discontinue good items!  Well, they did - Bare Fruit now sells their Cinnamon apple chips, which (to me) aren't good at all-too much of a good thing (cinnamon) just makes me sick after about 10 chips. Bring the grannies back! So I decided to look on the internet for an alternative & found these Fuji dried apples - they're really good (not as good as the grannies), but almost.  The only issue that I have is that I bought 4 bags (2 packs) and the chips are like crumbs-kinda like the bottom of your cereal when you're about to run out.  I was hoping for larger pieces - more like chips! These are remnants, sadly. The pictures shows full, round apple pieces - I had not ONE full apple chips, 98% were 1/2" in size and I had to pour them into my mouth like crumbs.  Very disappointed!!!

review/summary: Apples tear though packaging
review/text: The apple chips are sent in a silver package, not clear.  The flavor was okay but was afraid they were contaminated.  We received the bags with at least 4 different 1/4" size tears in them.  It had small pokes all over the bags from the apple corners poking through.  If the package is open at all there is a chance of getting stale and contaminated.  I like the bag that the apple chips come in "Bare Fruit Cinnamon Apple Chips", the apple chips do not poke through packaging.  I stopped my monthly order of the Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Apples, Fuji, 1 Pound Bags (Pack of 2) due to the packaging. Who wants to eat anything torn open...

Gone.  "We don't carry them anymore."  Rats.  Checked other stores.  Nope.  Finally found them at Sprouts, price not so awful, but still pretty high even on sale.  Enter Amazon.  Just thought I'd check out organic & gourmet foods here.  BINGO!!!  Same apples, in huge 1 lb bags.  Absolutely love them.  I'm sitting here munching on them right now.  Just as addictive as potato chips, twice as tasty, and healthier.  Yea!  I may have to subscribe to Prime so I can order them as often as I need to and not run out.  LOL!

I found the pieces to be a nice sizes (about 1/4 of a cored circular apple slice), not musty at all and no seeds so far (as other reviewers had noted).<br /><br />The one year shelf life is nice. I keep extras on hand for emergencies.

review/text: If you're looking for a snack that's more natural and less processed, these are great.  I prefer these to other brands of dried apples (e.g. Sunmaid) that are only partially dried and remain chewy (or rubbery).  These are crisp, like potato chips, but with real flavor to them.  These are made from Fuji apples, and while Granny Smiths would better, they don't seem to be available in bulk (at least not from Amazon).  I agree with the reviewer who says you should keep them in the bag they come in, and disagree with the reviewer who mentioned a "musty" taste. I've gotten through two bags of them, and they've all tasted fine.

I figured I'd like it even more without cinnamon so I found these on Amazon and oh my... they are AMAZING!! I have eaten one full pound and have not experienced any bad chips like the one reviewer who said they were musty. My roommate ate the other pound and said one chip was incredibly sour, but all the others were great. The only reason I took off a star is because the packaging did not include nutrition information. It was easy enough to find on livestrong, but I definitely think it should be included. Because the chips are all different sizes they don't give an easy to visualize amount, say 1/4 cup = this many calories.. You really need a foods scale to know how much you're eating but in case its of any use to anyone, 24 grams of chips is 58 calories. 16 g is carbs, and 2 g fiber.<br /><br />I gave some to my dad to try. He grows about 10 different varieties of fruit trees, including apples. He said he's dried apples before and they taste the same as these! He takes care not to use anything non-organic or unhealthy so its good they taste the same! Also for some reason they store better in the shiny bag they ship in. I divided one bag into ziplocs to be able to grab for snacks, and they got sort of soft, whereas the chips kept in the original bag inside a ziplock stayed crispy and fresh.

Realized I was picking through the bag for the red ones (avoiding the Granny Smiths!), since they were the sweetest, crunchiest, and yummiest! I desperately hoped they were Fuji, since they don't sell Gala on its own like this. And, YAY, THEY WERE THE FUJI APPLES! 2 LBS OF SWEET, CRUNCHY APPLES IN BULK FROM AMAZON!! :D No more picking through! (Even though the Costco 14 oz bag of the medley was $5.99 and a better deal for dried apple chips in general...)<br /><br />Also make sure, as others have noted, to keep the apples in the bag they came in. Ziplock bags don't preserve food as well as metal/foil-lined bags, and so the dried apples will go stale in Ziplock bags.

review/text: Satisfying snack. But, they will lose their slight crisp texture and get kinda chewy when mixed with other moist fruits in a trail mix, so keep them sealed & separate.

review/summary: Can't eat just one....
review/text: After reading these mixed reviews, I didn't know what to expect from these. Well, I finally had to put the bag down to write this review. The first one out of the bag wasn't particularly crispy, but that was fine--it still had a very strong apple taste (I don't see how anyone can compare these to cardboard unless their tastebuds are compromised somehow). The next dozen pieces were very crispy. And I find the taste to be very flavorful (with 61-year-old tastebuds...). So count this review as a definite YES! And now I would like to go back to my snacking.

review/summary: CAUTION
review/text: These apples should come with a warning -"Addictive". They are very crisp (not chewy like air dried apples) with a tart/sweet taste and as impossible to put down as a bag of potato chips. Fortunately, they are just Fuji apples with no flavorings, chemicals or preservatives added. My kids are nuts for them and they are great for school lunch. A no-guilt healthy snack and they are good with fruit dips. Have not tried to reconstitute them to cook with yet but planning on trying them in fried apple pies like my grandmother made with air dried apples. Have been through several packs and have not found any with the musty taste mentioned in other reviews. They MUST stay in the mylar bag to stay fresh. Will be ordering a lot of these apples.

review/summary: Back to the store for me
review/text: I bought this snack in a store initially and fell in love with them, I must say I really enjoy the taste, I love that it's all natural and low in calories, the product gets a 5 star for taste. I ordered the 1 pound bag on auto-delivery but I must say I'm dissapointed because about one third of the bag was crumbs. The pieces are so broken, I cannot eat them as chips as intended. I waited until I opened the second bag before writing this review but I'm really dissapointed at the amount of crumbs/really small broken pieces that were in the packaging in the second bag as well. When I buy them in the store, almost the entire bag are large chips. I have discontinued my auto delivery. I guess I'll just continue to get them at the store. What a let down.

review/text: As we get older an are allowed less to eat, it's good to find something good for us and that tastes great. These apples are delicious and are quite filling. We use them as snacks, plain or mixing them with other dried fruit. We also eat them on salads. I couldn't be more enthusiastic about a product. Our fiends buy them and leave a bowl out for their grandkids instead of candy. It's a perfect snack and the kids love them. If the price sounds high, remember they are dried apples, so they are very light.

review/summary: Can't Stopping Getting More
review/text: I purchased these dried apples as a healthier substitutes for times when I want to eat chips. And these baked-dried apples are awesome!<br /><br />The flavor is quite natural, it's like the real apples that not very sweet, and I even got some quite sour pieces. And the apple pieces are real-cut from apples, you can tell several parts from apple - although already shrink. People who are complaining the flavor should be aware those that tastes good usually has hidden preservatives or sugar added. In the end, a real apple wouldn't taste much better than these dried apples.<br /><br />I have to admit that they tend to be a little bit too crispy some time that biting is not very easy. But it does help me to slow down while eating it - it tastes so good to me that I just can't stopping getting for more! Plus, the 2pack 1 pound is good amount - not to little that you have to order again and again, also not too much that u'll worry about ever finishing it.<br /><br />I'll try dried mangoes and cinnamon apples for next time.

review/text: We have purchased these dried apples several times now.  For me they're a great afternoon snack that satisfies my hunger but also my sweet tooth - they keep me from reaching for chocolate or other less healthy alternatives.  We'll continue to buy them.<br /><br />I would recommend that you keep them in a dry place and in a container that seals.  We live in a humid climate and had to discard some because they became spongy and gross.

review/summary: Very crispy, Great Apple flavor with a slight sweetness
review/text: The price on this product is great, compared to the other prices on the market. You will not get a true apple taste or texture like the freeze dried ones. However, your not paying $25 a pound. These are very crisp and do have a great apple taste with the slight sweetness you'd expect from a Fuji apple. There is peelings on the apple pieces but it doesn't seem to make them bitter. About half of the pieces will need to be handled and ate in the way you would peanuts; for an adult this is fine but not a small child. Personally, I found them great and have signed up to get them shipped every month. Being a diabetic, these are a great item. Low in carbs (6 carbs per 1/4 cup) and helps with sweet cravings.

Best bargain is to buy the big pounder packs and divide them up yourself.  The little bags are good but too expensive for the convenience. Love these but not the Granny Smith Apple chips as much. Granny's not as sweet.  I want to try the Mango chips next.

review/text: When ordering this type of food online, we're always mindful of expiration dates and freshness. The batch of dried apples we just received is crunchy, fresh and full of flavor. While we enjoy organic dried fruit, we're not fans of the "rubbery" dried apples most often available. These apples are a satisfying snack food, and are perfect for a healthy lunchbox treat. While we eat them straight from the bag, they seem suitable for adding to oatmeal, yogurt, and for baking. I would prefer that the bag be labeled "organic" (so that I know that they know), but I'm taking their word for it... Enjoy!

The price is excellent compared to the dried apples we were buying at the health food store.  We have these set to ship out automatically once a month.

review/summary: The best Earl Grey!
review/text: This is the best tea I've ever tasted - period! Each canister has a double lid plus comes sealed in plastic to preserve the flavor. On opening the lid, the rush of bergamot aroma hits your nose. Wow! You also smell the flavor of the black tea (unlike some other Earl Grey brands where all you get is the bergamot). The leaves are indeed the prized small buds from the top of the plant.<br /><br />This tea cannot be over-brewed. I left it longer than 5 minutes a couple of times and it never became bitter or acidic. Always you taste the smooth black tea and the bergamot is strong but never over-powering.<br /><br />I also like that you're supporting a local grower and the workers instead of being syphoned off into a large mega-corporation.<br /><br />If you like Earl Grey, get this tea! You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: VERY pleasant surprise! (from a Peet's drinker)
review/text: It started with Peets coffee in Berkeley, 1980....couldn't then, get better coffee. Now much older, I'm picky about what we drink. THIS tea, I used to order directly from Sri Lanka; $10 for 4 tins, and $30 for Fedex!!! Now available from Amazon, it is VERY HARD to find any Earl Grey that is FRESHER, or of higher QUALITY. Peets in the a.m., and Dilmah Earl Grey in the p.m., for a refreshing LIFT, that coffee just can't match - weird, but true. Wish we could try a SAMPLING of the other GREAT Dilmah teas...but, no one has gone that MARKETING route, sadly.

review/summary: Loose "Leaf"
review/text: I love loose leaf tea - the large leaves brew slowly, giving flavor but not bitterness. It has a subtle quality about it that sets is apart from the grounds found in tea bags. This tea does not have that quality. Rather than whole leaves, the tea is ground-up bits like in English breakfast tea. Even after brewing the leaves are tiny chunks. Rather than a long, slow brew, I found that this tea takes on a bitter edge after as little as two and a half minutes. I usually brew tea bags longer! If you keep the brewing short and use a lot of leaf to compensate it can be drinkable, but why bother when you can do better with a bag? I won't be buying this again.

review/summary: Bitter Earl Grey Imitation
review/text: For those who truly love Earl Grey tea, pass this one by.  For those who have never tried loose leaf Earl Grey, please don't let this be your first.  While many have complained about the "chopped" state of this tea as opposed to true loose leaf, that is hardly the biggest problem with it.  It was the acrid aftertaste that caused me to write this one off as a lesson learned.  The bitterness absolutely overwhelmed the pleasant bergamot experience that Earl Grey drinkers so anticipate.  While I agree that the double-lid canister is an excellent design I think it will serve me much better by holding another brand of tea.

review/summary: Good, but not great.
review/text: I purchased this tea over a year ago and thought it was great. After I ran out, I was contemplating reordering it, but decided to read some product reviews. A few reviews mentioned that it was not a whole leaf tea, so I decided to look for a whole leaf variety. You can really tell the difference. The Dilmah has a bit of a bitterness to it and the bergamot flavors are not very strong. Look for a whole leaf variety instead.

review/summary: Bergamot Beware
review/text: the Bergamot used here smells and tastes like rancid Lychee nuts, so if you are just looking for a pleasant black tea, pick something else.  A tea at this price point should not be using "flavoring" but the real essence, oil or dehydrated Bergamot citrus fruit.  The leaves are cut up into 2mm bits, so you must use a paper filter when seeping this loose tea.  The double capped tin does a fine job of air sealing the tea, so there is no need for an inner foil wrapper as others have contested.

review/summary: More Qestions Than Answers
review/text: Great bergamot aroma, but unacceptable bitterness. , My question is this real bergamot oil used in the process or just an artificial substitute? Usually when the natural oil is used it states so. This tea only list bergamot "flavor" as the ingredient. This is usually a clever "legal" way of cheating on customers.Second, like some others have written, I also noticed a harsh bitter aftertaste when brewed past 5 minutes. Thats not very long and one shouldn't have to put a stop watch to a cup of tea! Maybe an artificial bergamot makes it bitter? I've been searching for a replacement  for an old favorite.Best Earl Grey ever was Williamson & Magor, but sadly the company is no longer solvent after a 100 plus years. They used genuine bergamot "oil" and it was phenominal! Dimah's tin caddy is fantastic and should be an industry standard!<br /><br />Update: Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey Leaf Tea, Loose Leaf, is awesome!!! Beats this bitter Dilmah impostor like a rented mule. Taylors of Harrogate is even better than my old favorite and uses "REAL" oil of Bergamot.

review/summary: No more vomit! (nice title huh?)
review/text: My 12 year old cat had seemingly developed some stomach issues and was vomiting nearly every day.  I suspected they were from an intolerance to dyes and other unnecessary stuff they put in mass market cat foods.  Since she's been on this,she hasn't gotten sick once!  Hallelujah! If your cat has a sensitive belly, try this!  Also, I will say that she really likes this food...I did try a few others along the way (Blue Buffalo, By Nature) but she didn't  love them.  This food smells fresh and is very very tiny...little balls smaller than a pea.  It's easy for her to eat and digest.

review/summary: Outstanding Product
review/text: My 7 year old rescue cat came to me skinny and with huge patches of coat missing. She would lick and scratch at herself until she created sores, and was overall, pathetic looking. She also vomited daily. I tried numerous high quality foods to no avail. Then I found Spot's Stew sensitive. I chose the seafood medley since seafood is her taste preference. She loved the food; but more importantly, in days the vomiting stopped entirely. In a few weeks she grew coat. Now, four months later, she has absolutely NO vomiting (not even hairballs). Her coat is thick and lusterous, and she has gained a significant amount of weight. Because this food has such a high protein and fat content, I have to feed her less or she would gain too much weight. But Spot's Stew has changed this animal's life. I recently adopted a Lhasa Apso puppy whose coat is dry and itchy. I have switched her from Wellness (her breeder's choice) to Spot's Stew Salmon for puppies. She LOVES this food, and she has always been a picky eater. I am expecting the same coat changes that I found with my cat. I was a dog show fancier, breeder, and kennel owner for 15 years, and if I were still in that business, I would be using Spot's Stew for all my animals. It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny of the investment. OUTSTANDING food.

review/summary: They love it - both of them!!!
review/text: Yesterday, I had posted a rating of 2-stars for this product because one of my cats got violently ill after eating it.  Afterward when I tried to give him a little, he wouldn't even go near it.  I was worried about my cat, so he was my main concern.<br /><br />It turns out that my previous suspicion was right:  he got sick because of a hairball, not the food.  I feel so relieved that he's okay.  I'll just have to make sure to brush him more so this doesn't happen again.  So, I've upgraded ny review to a 5-star rating.<br /><br />Now, he loves it!  When I fed my cats this morning, my cat who got sick gobbled it down with gusto, like he normally does!  That was such a relief!  There weren't any pieces left in the dish.  I mix it with Friskies to give them a little variety, which they seem to like, so it's easy to see when they don't like something.<br /><br />As a side, both of my cats also love the Halo wet food - it's their favorite thing to eat.  They go crazy when I give it to them for dinner!  I am still waiting for the Lamb Spot Stew to show up - it's a new flavor for them and I'm sure they'll just love it.

review/text: I have been a fan of Halo pet food for several years now.  Halo, truly is a wonderful brand of food with quality ingredients.  I decided to purchase this "sensitive" formula because my cat was puking up several times a week. Needless to say, I was ready to try the sensitive formula because who really likes to clean up cat puke.... Major Yuck!!!<br /><br />Anyways, my cat is on her 3rd bag of this formula and has done remarkably well.  The puking has decreased dramatically and she seems more satisfied after eatting with this formula plus her coat looks remarkably more shiny.  She eats several mini meals a day.  I've noticed that helps with the puking situation as well.  I am so happy that Halo created this "sensitive" formula, it has really made a positive difference in my cat's overall disposition and health.  Yay Halo and yay Amazon for carrying this formula of Spot's Stew since my local store doesn't carry it!

review/summary: Smells like French fries but my cat loves it
review/text: Our cat has had trouble with some other cat foods we've tried with her. She always seems to be stinking up the house with her gas or her visits to the litter box. We tried a couple different high end cat foods. All they did was make it worse. We started getting more natural food for her and it helped but not by a whole lot. I found this by searching through Amazon and reading some reviews. We decided to try it out.<br /><br />She's doing much better now. She is hardly gassy anymore (except when she gets scared, pfffft! lol) and her poop doesn't smell horrible anymore. She also doesn't stink up the litter box room anymore. We are in love with this cat food even though, for some weird reason, it smells like French fries. No complaints there but it's just weird. I'll try to post a video of my cat eating it.

I tried it out by putting the Halo alone in a bowl for them and noticed that they would not eat it. Then I provided them with their favorite Purina One Maturity and they proceeded to eat. Two days later, I placed the Halo and Purina One in separate bowls, they only ate the Purina One Maturity.  The product sounds wonderful but cats are finicky creatures.  I returned this item which is much more expensive than other brands.

review/summary: Transformed our sickly, skinny, girl into a beautiful fat cat !
review/text: We adopted a beautiful gray kitten from the local rescue shelter, after a year or so she began to become very lethargic. She lost weight and her coat became very patchy - she was scratching and itching constantly. She also vomited nearly every day.<br /><br />The vet thought perhaps food allergies were the culprit and he recommended another premium food, which helped with her coat, but she continued to lose weight.<br /><br />We are becoming very concerned at this point, and decided to stop into a local specialty pet shop. They recommended Spot's Stew sensitive.<br /><br />The food has most assuredly changed my cat's quality of life. She has gained weight, her coat is shiny, healthy and full, the scratching and itching has ceased. She is full of life again and very playful.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this cat food if your cat has sensitivity issues. It truly has been a life alternating choice for our cat. It has been several months and we are quite pleased with the outcome.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.

review/summary: Helped with stomach problems
review/text: Our cat was on a mysterious vomiting spree for several months -- he threw up partially digested food nearly every day.  Even after blood tests, X-rays, and ultrasound, we couldn't figure what his deal was.  We tried giving him prescription and novel protein foods, as well as different brands of foods, but every morning we'd find that cold, semi-chunky puddle on the floor.<br /><br />We looked around for new foods to try and found Spot's Stew.  Pet foods are hard to pick out, since there doesn't seem to be a very thorough understanding on what's nutritiously suitable for our pets.  Are blueberries and zucchinis any more suitable for cats than corn?  And is it worth the premium?  No clue, but we decided to give Spot's Stew a try.<br /><br />Our cat has been on this food for a couple of months.  He still vomits once every couple of weeks, but it's an improvement from vomiting every day.  The smaller size of the kibble definitely seems to help with digestion.  If the cat does vomit, the kibbles are saturated with fluid; in his other foods, they came out still hard and compact.  No word on whether the special formula helps with the stomach problems.  He seems to adore the taste.<br /><br />Some reviewers said that this food made their cats' poop less smelly.  I have to disagree.  Our cat's poop smells terrible.  It smells kind of cheesy now.  But it's good that this food goes down and out rather than up and out.  We'll stick to this brand.

review/summary: This is a deal!
review/text: I used to be the only one I knew who loved this candy, then eventually my wife grew to love them also... We started calling them "Vitamin G" way back in the early 90's, but then my youngest daughter came along and she is also an addict!<br /><br />But here's the deal, I grew up loving the hard stale Good and Plenty that came out of the "Choo Choo Charley" boxes, but once I stated buying the 7 ounce bags and got fresh Good and Plenty, I grew to even love it more. Here on Amazon is about as good of a deal as you are likely to find at about $1.40 bag it is less than I can find at even the discount grocery stores where freshness is hit and miss.
