review/text: No question about it, Basic 4 delivers the yummies! Packing corn and bran flakes as well as multitude of nuts and berries and even puffed rice. It's a party in your mouth.<br /><br />Works well with regular milk, soy milk or for extra kicks, chocolate milk.

review/text: The person I sent this to said it was great - it really cheered her up and the munchies were delicious.<br />The only thing I could complain about is when I ordered there was a space to fill in a short note and who the basket was from - but that note was not delivered with the basket, so the recipient didn't know who it was from!<br />Otherwise it arrived on time and was enjoyed.

review/summary: My bottles leaked
review/text: I ordered this flavored syrup and when it was delivered, the box was wet.  I unpacked the box and discovered that the bottle had leaked.  I ordered the same name Monin sugarfree and regular and both boxes were soaked with the liquid in the bottle.  Very disappointed.  Will not order liquids online again.

review/summary: The piture of the product was confusing
review/text: The price said it was for individual tubes but the picture showed a box of 6 tubes.  So I ordered 5 just in case it was a box of 6 but it was 5 tubes not 5 boxes of 6 tubes.  Also, this vendor used a shipping method that means they came by container ship not priority mail.  Suppose to arrive Feb 17th - Came March 6th.<br /><br />I really like this product because in the tropical heat I leach electrolytes and nuun doesn't have any calories and has what I need in it to keep from having to eat salt or chips.  Unfortunately it is hard to come by on Guam.

review/summary: amazing
review/text: I used these for the first time this summer hiking the Grand Canyon and other places out west, we took down bottled sport drink and these tablets to save weight. At home I tried them and thought they taste like watered down grape jello, but not bad. On the trip I was amazed, sports drinks got hot and tasted gross and sticky, made you feel bloated yet still thirsty. These little tabs cover the taste of water, didn't make your mouth feel gross and you could feel the pick up it gave you. Completely satisfied with the product and willing to try other flavors. It was easy to use, pop them in your bottle and they fizz away, a quick shake and your ready to go. Don't pop them in your mouth, as a buddy of mine did thinking thats how you used them, he gagged his way through for quite a while, I still laugh at the memory.

review/summary: NOT "All Natural"!!!!
review/text: I used to love Bosco. My mom used to buy it for all of us kids. I loved it so much, my mom used to say, "Let's go, Bosco!" when we were ready to leave somewhere. I was saddened when it was no longer available in my area.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2012...I discover to my utter delight that Bosco can still be purchased and is available online! I ordered some, it comes in the mail, I'm so excited to share this great tasting stuff with my kids and to my incredible disappointment, I find that they've begun using High Fructose Corn Syrup (for the record, I didn't purchase it at Amazon which does list the ingredients...I found it elsewhere accidentally before even thinking of checking here). That stuff is horrible for you. Among it's many crimes, it tells your brain you're still hungry after you've eaten and tells your pancreas to stop producing insulin (which of course would eventually lead to diabetes...hmmm, gee, seeing as how Coke & Pepsi have been using it for 25 years, I wonder why there's been a rise in cases in that length of time?). It also is clinically linked to the obesity problem in this country.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Bosco claims on their label that the product is "All Natural" which is completely false if the product contains HFCS since HFCS is made using two genetically modified enzymes, therefore NOT "all natural".<br /><br />I'll order Fox's U-Bet if I ever want chocolate syrup (delicious stuff with ZERO HFCS), but when it comes to chocolate milk, I'll stick to Ovaltine for me and the kids. Not only is it nice and light (not heavy syrupy), but it also contains vitamins (Bosco contains some B vitamins, but the use of HFCS, in my opinion, negates that).<br /><br />Be warned, it's not your daddy's Bosco!

review/text: First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.

review/text: I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

General Mills has changed the recipe that we all loved so much and made them odd shaped and much harder. These "Coco Roos" are firm and crunchy yet light and airy.  They are DELICIOUS, much better than the brand name and any other immitation out there.  I love these single serving bowls as well, PERFECT!  The price cannot be beat.

review/text: Out of the three flavors I received, the apple was my favorite. The mango and pineapple were really good too, but the pineapple was extremely crunchy. The mango was great, if you love sweet and delicious things. The best way to improve this product would be to make more variety of fruit flavors! I can't wait to get more! Eating this product was as much fun as it was looking at and feeling the different shapes. This is all natural, and all good.

review/text: I "love" this mousse!  I'm hooked!  It's my new "chocolate fix" and it's low calorie compared to typical "fixes", but doesn't taste like it!  I began to love mousse after trying the yogurt mousses on the market.  I try to make everything from scratch, but the homemade stuff is like 18 points (on Weight Watchers points Plus)!!  THIS box is only 3 to 4 Points Plus per serving!!  Yay!! And the texture & flavor are perfect!! I've made several mousse recipes, w/ the egg whites & w/out... and none of them are as good as this.  THIS is what I really was craving.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether we're actually gonna' get the 12/box, like it says though.... according to some other reviews.<br /><br />I know in Calif- there's only ONE store that carries mousse mix, and surprisingly it's in my small-town grocery store of all places.  ;-)<br /><br />If someone could verify whether they'd actually recieved a 12pk, we'd appreciate that, as well, as to how many servings per packet, please.  Thanks!

review/text: Despite my dairy allergy, I'm miraculously able to eat cheese without any truly dire side effects. While a friend and I were out the other day, the bizarre appearance of this cheese made it stand out from the others. That it contained porter was an interesting side note. Being the adventurous sort when it comes to cheese, I gave it a chance.<br /><br />It's freaking amazing. I'd use stronger language to emphasize this, but Amazon standards y'know.<br /><br />The cheddar has a wonderful sharp taste to it that is really well emphasized by the bitter porter flavor. It's pretty much heaven in a mouthful and stands incredibly well on its own. You don't have to pair this with anything to enjoy it, although I'm planning on trying it out with a variety of things to see how it does. I really loved letting the porter around the cheese melt in my mouth, then devour the cheddar. I don't want to sound like a pretentious cheese snob because I'm nothing of the sort, but this really was a great experience.<br /><br />A bit of a warning, though. This cheese can crumble (not that this is a bad thing) so you'll want to exercise a little caution to ensure that all of the morsels end up in your mouth and not on your shirt. I found that out the hard way.

review/summary: A much-missed favorite.
review/text: A few years ago, my cats and I relocated to Germany. And while my four-pawed trio generally took the move in stride and quickly adapted to their new home in a manner that filled me with new love and admiration for them, there is one item now, several years later, still sorely lacking in their lives: Pounce Tuna Treats! For as long as we've been together (and in the case of the two females, that means their entire life), there has never been a better way to reward them or just show them my affection than by giving them some of these - my cats loved them, and I knew that due to the treats' many healthy ingredients I was actually doing something good for my kitties in addition to making them happy. But Pounce is nowhere to be found on the shelves of German stores! My cats are not overly picky in their food choices; they willingly accept almost everything appearing in their food bowls. But they have made it quite clear to me that a decent substitute for Pounce is yet to be discovered. In the meantime, what's a poor cat owner to do???

She doesn't like crunchy treats much, so these are perfect for her. I've given her all three flavors and she seems to like them all equally. They do tend to dry out by the time I near the end of the bottle, however. The flip-top lid is very handy. Very nice, inexpensive kitty treats.

review/text: When I first started to buy VitaGravy, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.

review/summary: Trident with Xylitol
review/text: After having been diagnosed with dry mouth syndrome, my dentist recommended that I start using Xylitol in the form of gum and mints. And after finding out that Trident had the Xylitol, I started chewing the gum, which is very flavorful and seems to last a long time. However, after having a few stomach upsets after chewing the gum, I decided to read all the ingredients and to my dismay saw that they still use the dreaded aspartame in this product. This is a turn off, and my question is, if they are using Xylitol for a sweetener, why would they use aspartame as well.

review/text: The picture shows a 12 pack box of Scrabble Cheezits. I ordered 3 of these for a school function because you can't find these anywhere in stores. The Scrabble Cheezits are always packaged with other snacks, which I didn't want. It was approximately $10 per box and I ordered 3, thinking I would get 36 snack packs for a class. They sent me 3 regular-size boxes for approximately $40.00! They need to change the picture so people know they're selling regular size boxes of Cheezits. If they were substituting a product for one that they ran out of, a regular-size box costs nowhere near $10. It then cost me more money to return the item. What a stinkin' rip off! I will never order from this distributor again. Once and done!

I like the proportion of Omega-3s in this product. Flax seed oil is best used within two months of opening and I always keep it refrigerated. I have purchased smaller containers in the past from Whole Foods - this seemed like a frugal option. Very happy with the product which was sent with protection from the heat and it arrived promptly because of storage requirements.

review/text: I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because I should have paid more attention to the amount before I purchased it. These cans are tiny, 3 3/4 inch tall by 2 1/2 inches across. Each can holds about a cup of sugar. They recommend it for spice cake and sponge cakes which typically take 2 cups of sugar. Twenty dollars for the sugar for one cake is way too expensive. You can make your own at home by putting a chunk of fresh ginger in a decent size jar of raw brown sugar. I make vanilla sugar by putting a vanilla bean or two in a jar of white sugar. As far as the Terre Exotique sugar, it tastes good but not good enough to pay $10.00 per cup.

review/text: I ordered these on a whim.  I typically don't like the taste of raw food granola, but these were terrific.  Normally when I try sprouted products they have an unusual taste to me, but the Cocoa Bliss has a terrific flavor.  What I like the most about it is the versatility.  It could be used as a cereal, snack, or better yet even a desert because there is enough cocoa in it to satisfy a chocolate craving. I have been searching a long time for an easily digestible raw food snack that does not taste weird and is not too hard on the budget. I am happy to have found this product.  This will be a staple at our house.

review/summary: Tasty, but a little hard to eat
review/text: The chunks of this granola are huge, which is fine if you want to eat it like a granola bar. But I want to eat as cereal, and these pieces are just way too big and hard. I emptied the bag onto a cutting board and chopped them into smaller pieces, which helped tremendously, but what a messy job! Pieces flying everywhere because they are so hard. These taste very good though, so if you don't mind the size and density, then you'll like these.

review/summary: Coco puffs/krispies for Raw Food aficionados
review/text: As a kid i was very fond of coco puffs and cocoa krispies. As an adult mostly eating raw i find this granola very satisfying both as a breakfast cereal and as a snack (with nut milk on the side). Found this cereal in AZ but have not been able to buy locally so am trying another brand, but will request the local health food store to stock KAIA COCOA GRANOLA as it is the best. If you're a chocolate fan, try their COCOA MOLE sprouted sunflower seeds, an excellent snack that has a little kick of chili with the chocolate!

review/summary: Good source of Citric Acid
review/text: I bought Spicy World Citric Acid for use in homemade bath products; however, the product appears to be fully food grade.  The product was fresh, but the bag design leaves a little to be desired.  Although the bag is resealable once opened, all of the bags in our pack have openings around the resealable zipper ends.  The result is that once opened the citric acid can clump as it absorbs moisture from the air.<br /><br />Overall I would say that I like the Spicy World Citric Acid product and I will purchase it again.

The most expensive and worth every penny.<br />Anything else is a PRACTICAL JOKE - This is Caramel the way it should be. the balance between sweet and salty - hard and soft - is just... simply... PERFECT. It really does not get any better than that - Tasted the original Caramel from Turin, Italy - not even close to the French's Caramel. If you want the best - THIS IS IT !

review/summary: Defective k-cups
review/text: I have purchased hundreds of k-cups over the past four years and had never experienced any failures of the design.  This particular batch of k-cups had a defect in the top seal which causes coffee/water to flow out in an unintended way.  Thus essentially making these k-cup unusable and therefore a waste of money.

review/summary: Not as Satisfying as Green Mountain's Dark Roast Hazelnut
review/text: I ordered this from Amazon believing that it was the same Hazelnut flavored K-Cup that I got in an assortment from Green Mountain Coffee when I had purchased my Keurig brewer from them.  It was not.  The K-Cups that I got in the Green Mountain assortment were Dark Roast.  These from Amazon are not.  And, these are disappointing, by comparison.  These do not offer a full-bodied coffee taste, and are somewhat harsh.  The Dark Roast Hazelnut K-Cups were much richer and more mellow to the taste.  I went to the Green Mountain web site and could no longer find the Dark Roast Hazelnut K-Cups.  What a shame!  I cannot fault Amazon, but I wish that Green Mountain would bring back the Dark Roast version.

review/summary: nicely priced spice
review/text: This seems like a pretty good deal for 30 spice packs.  I also like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DXGN70">HAPPY PHO - Zesty Ginger, GLUTEN FREE Vietnamese Brown Rice Pho Noodle Soup, 4.5 oz, 2 SERVINGS Per Box (Pack of 6)</a> and posted a favorable review of it. But, with that one you only get 6 spice packs and are paying mostly for the flat rice noodles to go with it. Rice noodles are somewhat expensive any route you take (compared to say, wheat spaghetti, which if used, you may not have real Pho soup anymore). Still, look around and you may be able to find the thinner rice stick vermicelli at a good price. If so, the VV spices may be a nice low-cost alternative, without sacrificing flavor.<br /><br />Eventually, I may try the VV soup base, as well, but thus far have just been preparing the stock from about 10 cups of water with bouillon cubes (4 chicken and 2 beef last time). I have been opening the spice packet and pouring it in the stock, though it may be intended you filter the spice like a tea bag. This method didn't seem to make it too strong in the end, perhaps due to my stock being a bit watered down. I'll keep experimenting with the bouillon proportions, but my latest result was possibly the closest I've come to my favorite restaurant Pho (that's no longer nearby).<br /><br />Besides the water, bouillon, and VV spice, my recipe currently includes the following:  8 medium beef meatballs, 5 beef cold cuts, 1 cup chopped cilantro, 2 chopped green onions, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, 4 ounces rice noodles. Makes 2 or 3 large bowls full. Serve with fresh spinach leaves, bean sprouts, and chopped up serrano peppers (not the pickled kind) on the side. Plenty of sriracha sauce added to the soup is a must for me, along with a smaller amount of hoisin.  There's also a somewhat more involved recipe on the box you can try - mine is actually a variation on the Happy Pho preparation instructions, just using more broth, the VV spices, beef instead of chicken, and thin rice vermicelli.

For those who like to cut the sour (tartness), use a dribble of marashino cherry juice & a cherry.  These mixes have been used by my father-in-law, uncle, & aunt since the days of Johnny Carson.

Lotus Tea is green tea that has been processed with Lotus flowers.  The green tea itself is top shelf. It does not get any better.  But they must not have used many Lotus flowers during the processing.  The Lotus bouquet is rather weak.  But still, this is great tea.<br /><br />It is strong, so do not over-brew.  I use two small spoonfuls and I get 3 large cups of tea. I brew for two minutes at most.
