review/summary: Great for Keurig coffee brewers
review/text: My husband and I own a Keurig brewer. We love it but K-cups are so expensive and we were not willing to pay 50-70 cents a cup! I wanted the Kahlua K-cups but due to budget constraints, I ordered the 2-pack 12-ounce bags instead. We have a K-cup reusable coffee filter but the mesh cup doesn't seem to brew the coffee right so I also got these paper filters:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005SVV4MO/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details<br /><br />For each 8 oz cup, two teaspoons of ground coffee should be enough. I love the flavor of the coffee and the scent is intense but not overpowering. I love how our kitchen smells every time I brew a cup. For the price it's a really great buy. I just wanted to stress that it's not just good for regular drip coffeemakers but for K-cup types as well.

review/summary: Just didn't like it
review/text: I was intrigued by the flavor of the coffee, but I just didn't care for it (didn't come through in the brewed product IMHO)  I think my blah report is more of a personal preference for Starbucks coffee more than anything else.

review/summary: Coffee Only Better
review/text: We fell in love with Kahlua coffee years ago.  Another company supplied the flavor and Kahlua apparently told them they were in violation of trademark laws (or maybe they pulled the license).  At any rate, we've searched all over for years for the same flavor, ordering similar (but not quite as good) products from others.  Recently we discovered a bag of Kahlua "original" and it was great - authentic Kahlua taste!  What's not to like: coffee-flavored-liqueur-flavored-coffee equals coffee only better!  We never tire of the taste like we do with other flavors.  (We can't drink hazlenut coffee anymore.) Then we discovered that White Coffee is making it available through Amazon.  We recently received our first shipment and we love it!  We will be regular customers!

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: I received a small, 1.5 oz brick package of this as part of a gift this Christmas and just made my first, and possibly last, cups in a french press. The grounds do smell delicious, however, the flavor did not make it into the brew itself. It's very acidic/bitter tasting without any significant sweetness to indicate it came from the wonderful smelling grounds. The package recommends 2 rounded tablespoons of coffee for each 6oz cup, which seems high to me. I may try another round using only one tablespoon and see what that generates, but the manufacturer's directions leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.

review/summary: Kahlua Coffee
review/text: The smell of the coffee grounds is very rich, the taste of brewed coffee is a little too acidic for me. My husband didn't seem to like it as much as other flavors and commented that is tasted just like plain coffee, but Kahlua is a "coffee" flavored liquor...so the company probably did get it right.<br />The price is good for two very large bags of coffee and I like that it's free super saving shipping!

review/text: I am on auto delivery every 90 days for this product.  The Kahula flavor is just perfect.  Not too strong, yet not too subtle either.  Just a smooth delicious treat first thing in the morning, with danish in the afternoon and a perfect pick me up in the evening after the sun has set.  I am a staunch Starbuck Coffee person.  For many  years that has been the only coffee in  my home.  Now we switch off between the Starbuck House Blend and the Kahula Original Gourmet Ground Coffee!  If you enjoy Kahula, try this coffee, I think you will be impressed.

review/text: A coworker introduced me to this coffee, and I have been completely addicted ever since.  It is the only coffee I have ever liked enough to drink black.  We try to save ours for an occasional treat, but it is a struggle to reach past the Kahlua bag every week morning to make our cheaper usual coffee.  It makes the whole house smell amazing while it is brewing.

review/summary: Perfect for the flavored coffee lover
review/text: I'm the type of person who goes to a coffee shop and orders something that's mostly sugar and flavor. I claim to love coffee but have only found a few coffees I enjoy without any additional sugar, milk, cream, etc. THIS is one of those few. It's a smooth, sweet (but not overwhelmingly sweet) taste. My room mate likes her coffee to be a little less flavored and has found that if she blends half of this with her regular coffee, it provides her with just the right amount. Also, if you'd like it to be a little stronger tasting, add an extra tablespoon of grounds to your brew.

review/summary: COFFEE LOVER'S DREAM!!
review/text: This coffee is an absolute masterpiece! My mother is an avid coffee drinker, and is STRICT about having a cup every morning :) After nearly a year of drinking Folders, I ordered this as a surprise for her. She loves flavored coffees, but these high California prices keep us going back to our regular. I'd read dozens of reviews about this Kahlua coffee and couldn't WAIT until it got here...and I was not disappointed!!<br /><br />As soon as you open the bag, the delicious aroma smacks you in the face :) It hits you with notes of vanilla bean, creamy caramel, and RUM...RUM...RUM!! When we brew a cup, the entire house smells amazing. They should have used THIS in those Folgers commercials, because as soon as it starts brewing, we all climb out of bed and fight over who gets the first cup. We use Bailey's Hazelnut coffee creamer and mixed with this, it's simply divine. Major kudos to Amazon for selling this at such a great price. We'll be ordering this, and the other flavors, regularly.<br /><br />TRY IT!! You'll love it :)

review/text: In short... DISGUSTING. I grabbed this on a whim, as i had tried Collingwood Canadian whiskey before, and loved it. The difference between the Collingwood and the Tap 357 is very clear. Collingwood was mellowed in maple casks. Tap 357 is whiskey that was mopped up off the floor, and then had syrup dumped in. Neither the taste of the whiskey nor the maple have any appeal. The nose smells of nothing but maple syrup. One plus side to this product, will be a great replacement for Jameson in pancakes. DO NOT BUY

As an athlete who cares about eating quality foods, these bars are one of the few "quick" items I'm okay with grabbing on the go.  They're filling and healthy... and on top of all that, delicious. I love that the real banana flavor in these particular bars.  The chocolate is enough to make me feel like I'm treating myself without going overboard and eating a candy bar.  I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a low cal and tasty quick treat.

review/text: I bought these to tuck into my 5 year old's lunch box for camp this summer. Its hard to find a treat for kids lunches that does not contain dairy, nuts or wheat and that is an appropriate portion size for what is essentially a sweet treat. These fit the bill. The sugar clocks in at 9g per serving (we like to keep the kids treats under 10g) and the calorie count is at 130 calories per bar. The chocolate in them did melt and create a mess in his hands as he ate the bar (note to self: do not serve these in the car), but he still loved them and asked for them at snack time when he got home. I have also discovered that I like them for snack time too! They go great with a cup of tea and three napping children. ;)

review/summary: OMG! The best pasta.....ever!
review/text: I had eaten the DaVinci Spinich Nests years ago and then life moved on. Then I found a box half full and cooked it up and remembered when a wonderful product this is. But I could not find it in any of the four different market chains in my area. So thank goodness Amazon carried it. Unfortunately it only comes in a 12 pack, but hey, I'll use them eventually. I don't know why DaVinci is not sold everywhere, or at least the Spinich Nests. It's so easy to proportion it correctly since two nests seem to be just right per person. Of course more is always good too. I make my own red sauce with Turkey and crushed tomatos and all I can say is YUMMMY! If you have not tried this, don't waste another minute. I know I won't. Dinner anyone?

review/text: I don't know why it's so hard to find spinach pasta in stores these days, but I was very glad to find this one.  Good product, reasonable price.<br /><br />After cooking this pasta I discovered that it's almost impossible to keep it from turning to mush.  Even al dente, it has a starchy coating that sticks to the teeth.<br />Sorry I bought it by the case!

This was my favorite pasta for years, then I became vegan and started to realize most of my favorite foods contained dairy. I am absolutely overjoyed to learn I don't have to give up this pasta, as DaVinci does not add egg like most others do. Yay DaVinci!

review/summary: Very nice gift
review/text: First of all, the set comes as pictured-with three tins of tea, not 6 like the description states. That's not a problem, just an observation-I'd guess the tins are more like 2 ounces than one ounce.  I received this as a gift and was delighted-the assortment included a Christmas spice white tea, a lychee black tea, and a jasmine green tea, although I'm sure the assortments vary.  I'm very pleased with the tea-you can tell just by the aroma of the tea in the tins that this is good tea.  The sugar sticks are a nice treat-just the right amount for a cup of tea, and I notice that on their websites the sugar alone costs about ten dollars, so the assortment is a bargain if you're willing to take the risk.

review/summary: Great tasting protein bar with solid nutritional profile
review/text: I like using protein bars for breakfasts on the go and as meal supplements, so I'm always looking to find new ones that are healthy AND taste great.  Kashi's GOLEAN bar in the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie flavor is my latest discovery.  The tasty bar really is reminiscent of an oatmeal cookie, with a similar chewy texture.  It also offers 13 grams of protein--not as high as some sports-marketed bars, but still very good--and a whopping 6 grams of fiber (more than All Bran bars!).  An added bonus is the 10% RDA of Calcium, and finally, like all Kashi products, these bars are made with seven whole grains.  Definitely a recommended addition to any healthy diet!

review/text: I was not expecting it, but this bar has what seems to be a watered-down yogurt coating.<br /><br />The bar tastes fairly decent, but I wouldn't exactly call it oatmeal raisin.  It has a distinct raw cookie dough flavoring to it.  There doesn't seem to be much oatmeal taste.<br /><br />There are plenty of other bars out there with less fat (and FAR less saturated fat) that actually taste better.  This is a quality bar, no doubt, as are all Kashi products, but I would not care to use it as a meal replacement on a daily basis.

If you like really sweet spiced oatmeal raisin cookies than you would enjoy this, though.

review/summary: Best Bar, Period!
review/text: I have anjoyed the Kashi GOLean Oatmeal Raisin Cookie bar for several years now.  I first found them in my local grocery store, when looking for something nutritious that I could eat on the go.  I wasn't looking for some super high-protein, body-building, muscle mass-enhancing behemoth of an energy bar, just something that could fill an unusually long gap between meals, or even take the place of a small breakfast or lunch.  I was attracted to Kashi products because of the ingredients they use, and commenced reading the labels of all of them!<br /><br />This product had the best ingredients, listing Kashi's Seven Whole Grains & Sesame cereal as the first, and not listing anything scary or questionable at all.  The taste of the bar, while not exactly like an oatmeal raisin cookie, is excellent.  First, you taste the honey that is used in the exterior "icing" or coating.  Then you continue to a softer-than-chewy center that contains real raisins!  Great mouth feel, excellent taste!  This bar is filling enought to replace a small meal, and I ALWAYS take some with me when travelling.  After all, who really wants airport food?  Bring with you something you want, that is nutritious, and costs about $1.<br /><br />I used to be able to find these in my local grocery or Target store for about $1.10/bar.  However, nobody seems to carry them anymore.  Enter Amazon!  Through the Subscribe & Save program, I get a box of 12 bars delivered for $16.95 (free shipping!) at the interval of my choosing.  That's only about $1.40/bar, and I don't have to run all over town looking for them!  I am now a very happy camper (and traveler, and outdoorsman, and worker . . . )!  Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: THE BEST
review/text: Yes, these are actually the best yummy meal replacement bar out there. Delicious. However, after seeing some of the other reviews, it seems people are not totally clear on WHAT this product actually is-- yes, they have 280 (290?) calories a pop-- but they also have protein and 6 grams of fiber-- they are a MEAL REPLACEMENT bar, not a little 100 cal snack. If, like me, you can afford a 300 calorie snack in your day, then no, this doesn't mean you have to eat one of these for your lunch. But these are MUCH more filling (thanks to fiber) and satisfying than say, a Nutri Grain bar, which tastes like bread and jam mush. The Cookies and Cream and PB flavors are also great, but for whatever reason, I can never find this variety in-store, so I order them off of Amazon, like so many other things.

review/summary: I'd buy it again
review/text: I know Kashi advertises this bar as a cookie, but I use them as a meal replacement when I'm in a hurry and can't eat a regular meal and want to stay away from fast food.  This bar keeps me feeling full and satisfied until my next meal, and unlike many meal replacement bars, this one has very good flavor and texture so you really feel like you're eating something substantial.  It contains 280 calories, 5g fat, 13g protein, and 6g fiber which I feel is a good combination.  The bar does contain 49g of carbs and 33g sugars which is much higher than I would normally eat for a meal (maybe that's why they call it a cookie bar), but that fact doesn't bother me since it is full of healthy ingredients that are good for the body and I'm not eating a bar every day.  I have turned into a big Kashi fan and buy quite a few of their products because they are natural, taste good and are good for you.  P.S. If you haven't tried their new trail mix cookies, you're missing out.

review/text: Amazingly DELICIOUS and extremely ADDICTING! I've tried a few different protein bars and Kashi GoLean Oatmeal Raisin Cookie bars are definitely my favorite. I could tell you, these are the ONLY protein bars I ever bought in bulk (Spending $1.59-$2.00 on ONE bar was getting pretty expensive and no other bar was worth investing into IMO). It doesn't have that bland organic taste like their GoLean Crunch cereal but it's not too sweet like other brand chocolately protein bars either. It tastes exactly like actual soft/chewy oatmeal raisin COOKIES like they're supposed to, NOT actual oatmeal (2 totally different things). They're extremely tasty and my family LOVES them! We have a high taste when it comes to good food too. It's really hard to limit yourself to one of these a day when they are this good.

review/summary: Sorry, I didn't like them.
review/text: The first thing I noticed was that the shells are very large.  Most are over 1" in length.  I was hoping that meant that the seeds inside would be large as well.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  The seeds inside are only slightly larger than the average sunflower seeds you find in the grocery store.  Also, the shells are rather thin and splinter, rather than seperate, when you crack them open.  Not good.  I liked the salt level of these seeds (David's are much too salty for me).  The seeds, however, are over roasted for my taste.  Think dark roast coffee--they were bitter, not sweet at all.  I tried seeds from four different bags in my order just to make sure I didn't get one bad bag, but they were all the same.  Even if they were priced the same as the kind you buy at the convenience store, I would not buy these again.

review/summary: AMAZING FOR HAIR!!
review/text: I bought this particular coconut oil at Whole Foods, but I wanted to write a review on here for anyone who is interested in using coconut oil. This brand is very good. It was a bit more solid in the store, due to the fact that it's cooler temperature than my apartment. When it heats up, it melt and is just a clear oil. When I opened the jar, the smell was amazing! I love the smell of coconut. I did a deep conditioning treatment with this for my hair which is a bit dry and damaged, and also very fine. I put a pretty good amount of this and rubbed it through the length of my hair, and also massaged my scalp with it. I left it in for about 2 hours and then washed it out with shampoo and then conditioned as normal. Even as I was washing it out, it felt amazingly soft. I also tried another version of the deep conditioning treatment - I left it in over night and washed and conditioned as normal the next morning. This really packed a punch - my hair was SO soft and silky and VERY shiny, I couldn't believe it was my hair. I couldn't stop touching it all day lol. This is more amazing than any hair product out there. And it's completely natural and inexpensive. And I forgot to mention your hair will smell absolutely yummy while you have it in :)

review/summary: unique moisturizer; recommend for dry, cracked skin and mild eczema
review/text: My wife purchased this coconut oil to use as a skin moisturizer. She was on a quest for a more natural / organic lotion and was recommended this by a friend. We began using the coconut oil on our children after they bathed and noticed that it left their skin softer and for much longer than the lotions we were using previously (aquaphor, ceraVe, or sebamed). In terms of moisturizing effect, it is on par with these other products as well. Also, our kids also seem to like the coconut oil and put up less fuss after bathing. It's something different and they really like the light coconut scent. It also seems to work well on mild eczema (and does it without the burning sensation). My wife also uses the coconut oil on her face as a lotion. I have used it to moisturize hands and feet.<br /><br />In terms of application, the coconut oil is a solid at room temperature, but melts quite easily. It gets soft and runny if you place the bottle in the shower as you bathe or upon contact with the skin, making it easy to apply on the body. One thing to keep in mind though is the oil is very greasy and can leave marks on clothing (although the stains seem to wash out). I have found that despite the greasiness, the oils absorb into skin relatively quickly (maybe 15-20 minutes), and when it soaks in, it is really soaked in (meaning you can wash your hands and it does not get greasy again). Still, we tend to use this lotion before bed most often.

review/text: I wanted to buy a small separate jar of coconut oil for skin and hair care so I decided to try this one. I love it. It's unlike any other coconut oil I tried better. It's creamier and melts instantly unlike other coconut oils. I've been using it on my face and body. I honestly notice a difference in my skin.  It's looks clearer and feels more moisturized. I hope they never stop making and or selling it on Amazon. I will definitely buy again.

review/summary: COCONUT FLAVOUR
review/text: I love this product so much!! I have tried many many brands of coconut oil and i stick to using it in my cooking and baking, not so much as moisturizer for hair and skin (but i think i will start to do this). The thing that's amazing about Dr. Bronner's is the COCONUT FLAVOUR that you can actually smell and taste omg its delicious!! many other brands have no flavour whatsoever and no scent of coconut at all. For me, someone who LOVES anything coconutty, its a big step up that this one has a beautiful flavour and smell. Its also nice that when you cook and bake with it, the flavour comes out in a subtle way, not too overpowering but complimentary. I use this for everything from eggs in the morning to baking cookies or pancakes. DELICIOUS, most definetly will stick to Dr. Bronner's from now on.

review/text: Saw in a magazine that virgin coconut oil worked to help blown-dry, or colored hair -- WELL - IT WORKS!!!  One tablespoon heated and combed through your hair, once-a-week does wonders!!  So, I ordered it, used it for three weeks and my hair looks shiny and healthy.  Just heat it, comb it through and wash as usual -- great hair tip and great product.  The magazine even mentioned Amazon and this product - so I am grateful for this tip for healthier hair, plus. . .it smells great, too!

review/summary: Terrible packaging, never got to use the product!
review/text: I was very excited when I ordered Dr. Bonner's Fresh-pressed Virgin Coconut Oil. What I did not know, however, is that this product is contained in a glass jar. The package arrived promptly via USPS, but in an awful state. The small cardboard box was SOAKED in oil, so it got all over my mailbox and other pieces of mail, and dripped all over everything. My only gripe is about the awful packaging. All it had for protection was a flimsy sheet of bubble wrap! I have posted a photo of the jar that I pulled out of the box. I filed a return claim and was contacted by NetRush, but I forgot all about it after a few days. I'm sure I could have gotten a refund but I missed the deadline. That was my fault, not theirs! Therefore, I will post a 3 star review. Great customer service, terrible packaging!

review/text: The flavor and mild taste are the first rate. For the price, this is the best Blue Mountain I had ever tasted. Recommend using good quality water in brewing of coffee, tea, beer and other drinks. If you don't use good water, no amount of quality ingredient would give you the flavor and taste you desire. I love drinking this coffee black since it's mild giving me the best aroma without diluting it with sugar and/or cream. I also recommend using at least 1 heaping TBS or 3 tsp's of ground coffee per 8 oz. cup of water. Not enough coffee ground would result in flat tasting coffee.<br />Enjoy!

Within a 3 mile radius I have access to at least 7 grocery stores and none of them carry this.  Thank goodness for Amazon!<br /><br />This is truly low sodium; not "reduced" sodium, which is still way too much. If you're not used to very low sodium products you may find this too bland but you can always add a teensy amount of salt and adjust slowly to a lower level of sodium.  My only complaint is I wish they made more varieties.

review/summary: a taste for absence
review/text: This product has far less sodium than either the regular or 'lower sodium' offerings of Campbell's and other companies.  If health concerns make this advantageous, it may take awhile to adjust one's palate.  Both myself and my father (94 this January) have added non-salt spices and other items to make the transition.  Once one has become accustomed to blander taste, there is the price.  Amazon's price (with the subscribe-and-save option reducing it 15%), is slightly less than that of my local supermarket, without the lugging of cans.  The plan also allows alteration of shipment dates to accommodate swells and lulls in usage patterns.  All in all, a perfect deal.

review/summary: Amazon is constantly running out of this soup
review/text: If you're on a low sodium diet, this is a good soup.  It's a little thin, but you can eat it with rice on the side as a filler.  If you're already on a low sodium diet, this soup is easy to take.  If not, you probably won't like it.  But for low sodium people, this soup has light year's less sodium than the "Healthy Choice" stuff that's in grocery stores.  Compare 140 mg per can vs. almost 1000 mg for the Healthy Choice.<br /><br />Problem is, Amazon constantly runs out of this soup.<br />Here's how to make a substitute:<br /><br />Buy the Campbell's Low Sodium Chicken Broth on Amazon.<br />Then get a bag of Manischewitz Wide Egg Noodles (orange package) at your local grocery store.  Put a whole can of the broth in a pot on your stove.  Add 1 cup of the noodles.  Add enough water to cover it.<br />Thrown in a little bit from a bag of frozen vegetables(peas, carrots and corn).  Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer (covered) for 7 minutes. Meanwhile, fry up a small amount of Hormel grilled chicken (in the brown box).  After 7 minutes, put the noodles in a serving bowl and sprinkle the fried chicken pieces on top.  Now you have a decent substitute until the soup is again available.  It's a little bit higher in sodium than the soup but it's still pretty low.

All the pouches came in cardboard boxes of 4 (totaling to 48 pouches of course). But I like that they come in a pkg of 4 at a time. If we are going on a trip I grab a few pkgs of 4 of different flavors. I don't have to worry so much about them getting squished because of they way they come. Very convenient.  I had one pouch that had sticky stuff on it but I am not sure where it came from because non were opened or tampered with. Threw the one away and washed that rest on that one particular pkg.
