review/text: I first found these in a neighborhood store. Now I can't get enough. I am on my 3rd case now. I eat them instead of crackers or chips with my lunch, or as a late night snack. I guess since they have vitamins, I don't feel like I'm cheating! I recommend them to EVERYONE!

review/summary: Fantastic toddler snack; wish they came in organic
review/text: I discovered these when looking for healthy snacks without gluten, soy, or egg for our now 19 month old son. He loves them. With 8g fat, 14g, carbs, 2g fiber and 5g protein, they are a lot more balanced than a lot of toddler friendly snacks.  While they have some salt, they have a lot less than potato chips and other similar choices.  Peacrisps make a good snack on the go and fit in a toddler Snack Trap very well. They aren't completely mess free, he gets a bit covered in greasy crumbs sometimes, but it's not bad enough to deter us. These are a welcome change from cereals and cheese cubes for portable snacks. I like that these are also getting at least a small amount of vegetables in him, too. I would give them 5 stars if they came in organic.

review/summary: Tasty, but not really a healthy snack
review/text: These have a nice pea flavor and are tasty.  However, I can't see how these are much better for you than potato chips (the only difference is really a pea vs. a potato, as they have about the same amount of fat.)  They claim they are baked but they are very oily.  Eating a serving or two of steamed peas would be a much healthier, and perhaps tastier, way of snacking.

review/text: Calbee Snapea Crisps are an absolutely delicious snack. I am always looking for a healthy crunchy snack and my niece introduced these to me, and I love them. There are so many foods that I can't eat, and I always have a craving for something crunchy that isn't "junk" food. Now I have found the perfect healthy and delicious "Munchy" for me. I go through bags of them like crazy. Oh and my two little female Shihtzu doggies love them also. As soon as I open a bag they are right on my lap. And I know I can give them to them as Snapeas only contain healthy ingredients. Thank you Calbee for making such a healthy and delicious snack. I rate them A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+ and have recommended them to everyone. And I find that ordering them through Amazon is the best way to go!!!!!

review/text: Be warned.  They are addictive; however, they are not dangerous!  I love salty, crunchy snacks but I have to limit my sodium and fat intake.  Trying to find something relatively healthy isn't that easy.  These are low in sodium, not too bad in the fat department, and they have a bit of fiber.  They may not qualify as real health food, but they come close enough for me.  They are great with a glass of wine or cocktail before dinner.  I think you will like them.

review/summary: An alternative to Cheetos
review/text: These are as good as far as exciting flavor and craving value as Cheetos, just without the orange color and cheese flavor. I can easily eat the entire bag, but they go through my system rather quickly. They aren't pea pods in the sense of dried vegetable chips, but rather pureed mixture of peas and other ingredients that aren't very good for you. As said, they are healthier than your typical snack food (pretzels always for the health-conscious though), but for the price of $1.99 at my local grocery store, they hit the spot nicely. The original and Caesar flavors don't matter to me; they are both very tasty. I recall though that the Caesar flavor is more enjoyable, but a little higher in sodium. As the saying goes, if it tastes good, it isn't necessarily good for you; I would say that this snack is a little of both, mainly thanks to some fiber. However, other reviewers have mentioned the corn oil used is GMO (genetically modified organism), but I am uncertain know how harmful it is to human health. Speaking of GMO, I have found such oranges at my local grocery store. They weren't very good! (Respect nature.)<br /><br />Just eat these in moderation as with anything else and you should be fine. Walk a few miles after eating these 'peas' would be my advice. Five stars for taste, so I would recommend these over potato chips or cheese curls any day.

review/text: My son loves these, but they can be expensive.  Getting them from amazon is much less expensive- especially since my son can go through a bag a day (and there's actually peas in there!)  I have to say that they are a love 'em or hate 'em kind of thing.  They have a crispy cheese puff texture, with a salty pea flavor.  My advice would be to get a bag from a "natural" type grocery store first before you invest in a dozen.

review/text: My 20 month old has been eating these since he was about 16 months old. They are a great snack for toddlers. He calls them "peas" and I don't mind giving him fistfuls!! Made with real peas & rice I feel so much better giving him this than a pretzel or cracker. I can bring them anywhere in a baggie or plastic container & they are the perfect snack. Kids on the playground are always trying to get at them & other moms are like, "What are those?" Love my peas! Cannot say enough about how great these crisps are!!  Only downside is that I wish the bag was re-sealable. Can't tell you how many have spilled out in my stroller or diaper bag.

review/text: I found these Snapea Crisps a while back at a local grocery store and enjoyed it so much that I decided to purchase an entire box with 12 packs (it came out less expensive and I was able to share them with friends). I liked that it was baked and that it was actually made from snap peas. If I recall correctly, the product's website explained that the peas are dehydrated and made into a powder form, in order to eventually make them into it's appealing snow pea shape. I enjoy the lightly salted flavor as well the crispiness of it - makes it difficult to just eat one. Also, my toddler and preschooler enjoy them, so I feel better about giving them a snack that contains peas. I'm not a fan of ceasar salad, so I have not ventured into the ceasar salad flavored crips, but so far I've enjoyed just the original flavor.

review/text: They're just really good, they have some protein compared to potato chips but they still have fat and salt so they do taste good.  But the sodium % of daily value which is 22 pieces is only 4% so that doesn't seem bad at all, I think there are bags of potato chips and pretzels and oh the worst are those corn chips, they are just like pouring a bottle of salt down your throat, these taste plenty salty to me.  They're addicting so watch out!  I also ordered some other snacks that maybe I can mix things up. Such a lucky find these crips, I just was hungry before my sewing lesson and stopped into a convenience mart and saw them, that was lucky, funny thing it was called Lucky Mart I think.  I don't live around there and dunno if they have em here and don't feel like looking so I figured just order the 12 pack online.  I read the snapeas mostly come from Canada and that they have good farming standards so hopefully it isn't so bad that these aren't organic.  Trader Joes green bean crisp also sound good, haven't tried them.

The price here is good, as my local grocery charges almost double per bag. Only critique is the package it comes in doesn't say how they're made. That would be interesting...

review/summary: So Coconut all you need are the trees ...
review/text: Normally I am not a fan of coconut. And when it comes in jelly beans, I am even less of a fan. But I love these.<br /><br />They start out with a real coconut taste ... you can almost see the palm trees swaying and hear the ukuleles in the background at the luau. As they dissolve, they become almost a fruity coconut, even more pleasurable to my taste buds. If you love coconut, you can't go wrong with these, but I do recommend that you try the sampler first, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a>, just because there are so many different flavors to try.<br /><br />I am grateful to have received a complimentary sampler to try these, and am loving almost all of the flavors. I didn't expect to enjoy this particular flavor, but I really did.<br /><br />David was the original inventor of the Jelly Belly, and has returned to the competition with a wonderful set of new flavors on his own! While these are more pricy, they are most assuredly worth it, if you are interested in pure flavors.<br /><br />Best of all for me, these do not contain artificial colors and flavorings, since I have a significant number of allergies.

review/text: I love this tea! Who ever thinks of it as cheap should really consider the complexity and the harmony of the flavors that come through with each cup. It may not be the prized white tea, but the nutty taste keeps you wanting more. It's a great part of my tea alternation. I go from something fruity to nutty interchangably. For my nutty trips I consider a cup of Genmai cha and Oolong and for the fruity I recommend a cup of Orange Blossom White Tea. Also try Japanese charry green. Enjoy!

review/text: I drink a liter of this tea a day. I was put onto it by a Japanese restaurant I frequent. I find that the rice/popcorn pieces in the Genmaicha remove the raw taste present in most raw green teas. Use one of those mesh tea-steeping balls to steep the tea so that the loose leaves don't end up floating around in your mug. Don't steep it too long; they recommend 30 seconds only, but a minute is OK. [...]

review/summary: PERFECT DRIED PEARS
review/text: After searching locally for dried pears, I was delighted to find these pears offered by Amazon - my favorite grocer. They arrived in perfect condition and I kept them in the double-plastic-bagged wrapping and put them in the lower part of my refrigerator for a few weeks. When the weather was cool enough for shipping cookies, I removed enough moist, delicious pear pieces (they are almost halves - beautiful enough to serve as they are) and chopped them for use in baking. I was creating a special cookie, "Pear Crisp in a Cookie" for our grandson who is at the Air Force Academy. I haven't heard a review yet but I'll bet they were a hit in Colorado Springs. Thank you, Amazon for connecting me with such a perfect, healthy (no sulphur) baking ingredient.

review/text: I am a huge fan of organic foods and have experimented for years on how to get my children to eat things that are better for them. That said, this pasta is as good as any other on the market, but you can make it wonderful just by adding two simple ingredients. After I take the pasta out of the pan to drain it, I add about a tablespoon of light margarine (any soft butter-type spread will work) and about 3 tablespoons of fat free sour cream (you may also use plain yogurt). I whisk the cheese powder into this mixture and then add the pasta back to the mix. My kids finish an entire box EVERY time. Try it!

review/summary: Try a Box Before Buying a Case - a review of BTN's Mac & Cheese
review/text: I like organic. We do organic milk and meat (and vegetables when we can afford them).  My children like macaroni and cheese - not my homemade casserole that I sweat and work over--of course lol).  But only Mac that comes out of a box. [My hubby likes my casserole btw]<br /><br />In any case, you would think organic *Back to Nature Macaroni & Cheese* that comes out of the box would be popular at our house but it's not. Simple put, my children won't eat it.  We have tried three different kinds --white cheddar, regular, and special shapes--all with the same results.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because of the *lack of chemicals* that the cheese sauce comes out a little grainy. Or maybe I just made it wrong, but my testy tikes won't gobble this down like non-organic, over-processed wheat Kraft Mac.<br /><br />Two Stars. Maybe I just had a couple of bad boxes. Or maybe I just didn't make it right that day, but my two (boy and girl) would not eat this macaroni and cheese product. If you are going to try it (products do get IMPROVED every day) then my advice would be to buy ONE box and try it; and not a case.

I make it with a little more butter and a little less milk which makes for a creamier, cheesier meal.

review/summary: Like the Mom Below, A Favorite for Us as Well!
review/text: Back to Nature's Spirals and White Cheddar not only makes me, as a parent, feel good about what my daughter is eating, but it's taken me back to my own childhood when powdered mac and cheese meals were something to crow over. My daughter, like many kiddies, can be a picky eater, but she always comes around when I make her this. Heck, I've even fixed for myself and LOVE the taste. I don't always use organic milk, but regular two percent works great in this and my daughter just can't get enough. We never dress it up, eat it as is and it is wonderful. A nice break from the American cheese colored mac and cheese brands. My only advice--it tates much better when the pasta is cooked al dente, which takes very litle time with these tiny spirals. Overcooked and it takes on a very different milder texture. I also advise using only the third cup amount of milk they suggest. Too much, and the taste of the white cheddar gets diluted. Too, this sells for a buck fifty plus tax in the grocery store. On Amazon, you're saving thirty-two cents a box with this 12-pack. Can you say, college fund?

review/summary: False Labeling!!
review/text: This stuff is called "Cook's Organic PURE Vanilla Powder" but it's definitely nothing of the sort. First of all, anyone should be weary of a "pure" vanilla powder that isn't dark brown/blackish in color. That should be the first give away. Cook's PURE Vanilla Powder is a white powder, and anyone who takes a moment to read the ingredient list should not be surprised to find that the #1 ingredient in this "PURE" Vanilla powder is, in fact, sucrose. That's right folks, it's sugar. Corn sugar. Cook's calls this product "a revolutionary vanilla and the first real alternative to pure vanilla extract" but the truth is there is nothing revolutionary here, and this is a horrible alternative to a perfectly fine product such as pure vanilla extract. As white as this powder appears by looking at the jar, one has to wonder just how much vanilla powder is actually even in there. It can't be much. Or maybe they bleached it?<br /><br />Anyone willing to shell out $55 for 4.9lbs. of corn sugar with a splash of vanilla will be very pleased with this product, but if one were to actually care about their health and well-being, it would be wise to stay clear of this product and purchase some REAL vanilla powder or a vanilla extract instead. (They do make vanilla extract without alcohol, for those trying to avoid it.)<br /><br />What we can learn from a product like this is the importance of reading labels. Always read the labels of products you intend on purchasing. Lesson learned? This stuff's junk. Go with another product.

From the first night, just shook about 1/2 teaspoon onto his meal and he dives right in.<br /><br />I do not know if he is a bit senile, or just lost some of his sense of smell, but I am grateful to Iams for coming up with this great stuff.  It smells like bacon to me...maybe it just smells good to him, but it works.

review/text: Our dog is really picky when it comes to her food. Decided to try this and give her food a little more favor and variety. We just use maybe a squirt (trying to maintain the balance of her premium food) and mix it really well to lightly coat all of her food. She eats all of her food right away versus not eating all of it. The cost in bulk is much cheaper the the single ones you can get a PetSmart or something. Shelf life is great as long as you don't open the individual bottles. Would recommend product in moderation.

They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a "gravy" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.

review/summary: Good Gravy!
review/text: Two years ago, this product was available at most large grocery chains, military commissaries and all pet stores.<br />Now it appears that it is only available thru on-line purchase.  Amazon's price was lower than I had ever paid - even before taxed. It is a great product and Amazon process and delivery service was prompt. I recommend both the IAMS dog gravy AND Amazon.com.

review/text: Yuck, Brownie jumps back whenever I try to let him smell it. When I put it on his food, he refuses to eat and backs away from his food bowl. I bought the Bacon and Roast Beef flavor, but he doesn't like any of them. He's not a picky dog, so it must really be gross. nice idea, but won't work if dogs won't go near it.

review/summary: Mmm... Banana!
review/text: While they aren't my favorite fruits, I do enjoy bananas and I keep them on hand because I love to add them to my smoothies (I usually add a heaping teaspoon or two of Matcha to all my smoothies too).<br /><br />This matcha has a delicious banana-y flavor that isn't too sweet.  The sweetness is from the fruit flavor and the Matcha itself, but it doesn't taste candy sweet, at least, not to me ... although it does smell like banana candy when you first open the package and all the while during preparation.  But, I don't get that sort of taste from the Matcha and that's a good thing, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />The matcha does taste a little different with the banana flavoring.  The normal vegetative tones of the matcha meld with the flavor of the banana ... the fruity notes of the banana ... in such a way that the vegetal notes seem to disappear and become more fruity.  The lovely, creamy, buttery tones are still there, and it still tastes like Matcha... but it's not veggie or grassy tasting like some Matcha can taste.<br /><br />I like!

review/summary: Do you Remember Circus Peanuts??
review/text: This is one of those matcha that you will want to have around for the kids, their friends, and when you want to make smoothies, or have a sweet treat. Its not my favorite from Red Leaf but its not bad at all it just reminds me of circus peanuts. Do you remember those things? Sort of like slightly hardened dried out marshmallow like candies. We used to get them at the dime store. Remember when we had "dime stores" ... haha anyway I do enjoy this tea - takes me back to the good ol days, and really where they all THAT good? Oh well the point is - this is some good stuff and I do like it but its more of a banana candy like flavor rather than fresh ripe banana but at the same time I just don't know how natural of a banana flavor one could possibly get - I don't know if I have ever had a better banana flavor in a tea or anything else for that matter that was not a banana itself. I think that banana flavored things always tend to have that slightly strange flavor to it.<br />Now, this is where things get really good ... I mixed my banana matcha with macadamia nut matcha to make a banana nut like matcha and it was excellent! Made a smoothie out of it that way too! It was QUITE yummy!

review/summary: Innovo EVO dry cat food
review/text: I wanted to try a new brand of dry cat food which was listed as not containing any grain fillers. The food is well made, but packaged poorly in a non-resealable bag. The bag was very small and over-priced. However, this is no fault of the vendor who shipped right away and the product was carefully packaged. So I rate the vendor at 5 stars, but the pet food manufacture would get a 2. Try the larger size, the 6.6 Lb. rather than the 2.2 Lb. It is packaged better and does not tear down the middle when you open it. The food is excellent quality!

review/summary: Okay for flavored coffee
review/text: I received a bag of Barnie's Santa's White Christmas ground coffee as a stocking stuffer this Christmas and am sipping my first cup as I write this.  The flavor combination seems overdone -- "coconut, nuts, sweet caramel, and vanilla."  Really?  Okay, it's impossible for my taste buds to decompose the flavor concoction to discern any one of those flavor components.<br /><br />What my eyes did notice on the ingredient label, however, was sugar.  The second ingredient of this product (which granted, could be anywhere from, say, 3% all the way to 49%) is sugar.  Given that I take my coffee black unless I'm drinking crappy stuff at IHOP or Denny's, and always unsweetened, I did a double-take at the ingredients list.  But the sugar doesn't rise above the flavor concoction, which probably means the percentage is closer to 3% than 49%.<br /><br />This coffee is not substantially different from most flavored coffees, meaning the actual coffee itself seems to not be especially high quality and roasted mild so the added flavor will come through.  Unfortunately, I'm a COFFEE guy, meaning I like my coffee to taste like COFFEE.  I'm trying not to let that stand in the way of giving as objective a review as possible -- I understand that flavored coffee is intended to taste more like the flavor and less like the coffee -- but I can't entirely get past a mediocre coffee and roast.  I can't really rate this any better than a Folger's Gourmet or Millstone flavored coffee.  100% Arabica means very, very little in the coffee market anymore these days.<br /><br />My conclusion is that, as with pretty much all flavored coffee, it's not really intended to be served/taken black.  You've gotta add at least a little cream or milk, and then you can probably slam it down.  But you might want to give it a taste test before adding too much sugar.

review/text: I recently ordered the hawaiian umbrella houseplant for a friend. I really liked the novelty of this particular plant and even though it did not have the option of enclosing a card, I still ordered it because I didn't see it offered through any florists and thought my name would be on the packing slip. Well no! She had no idea who sent her this plant and went on facebook trying to find the mystery sender. She, too, thought it was a unique plant and liked and appreciated it, but it would have been nice had she known who had sent it to her when she received it. On the upside it was well received, in good condition and arrived in a timely manner. So my main concern is the suggestion of offering the gift option. Most times plants are sent as gifts, I have yet to send one to myself.

review/summary: Not good for stuffing!
review/text: I have made stuffed grape leaves quite a few times before.  I used to buy a Greek & California brand of brined grape leaves from the grocery store; but since the store doesn't carry them, I ordered "Roland" brand.  These are the thinnest, most delicate grape leaves I have ever worked with.  Only 50% of the grape leaves were usable.  The rest were scraps.  Of the 50% that were usable, they were very thin, torn in places and had to be patched together sometimes.  I stuffed them with rice, etc. and never overstuff.  I think that they processed the grape leaves in brine solution for too long.  As far as my prep on them, I rinsed them and put them on warm water and gently boiled for 1 minute.  I do this all the time and have never encountered such leaves.  I knew prior to gently boiling them that the leaves were fragile because they broke apart in my hand as I was taking them out.  Don't buy this brand to stuff.  Stick with another brand.  I can't remember which brand I used to buy, but I think it had a yellow label (California) and the Greek one might have been "Krinos".
