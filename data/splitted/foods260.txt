review/summary: Tasty sour tea!
review/text: I am also trying out hibiscus tea because I have read that there are clinical trials that show hibiscus lowers blood pressure. I'm not sure how strong hibiscus tea is "supposed" to be, but about 10 petals in a coffee mug works for me. The tea produced is very strong and exceptionally sour which, personally, I love. I would say it's similar in taste to rhubarb which I also love. You can add a sugar or sugar alternative if you want, but I say it tastes great straight.<br /><br />I was expecting this to be a finely chopped powder, but as others have said, these are full petals (see my user added image). You don't really need to buy a tea strainer for this. I use a bombilla sometimes,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141O2IA">Stainless Steel Spring Bombilla 1 Count</a>, but really, it isn't necessary. Which is convenient for those of us who get lazy. Put petals in coffee mug, pour in water, microwave for 1:30, voila! Just throw away or eat petals when finished. (They have a nice texture to them after they've steeped for a few minutes).<br /><br />Other notes: the tea produced is a very deep and pretty magenta. If it spills on something white, like for example my shirt, it turns into an indigo stain. Would probably be good for and all-natural tie-dye.<br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br />"A study published in the Journal of Human Hypertension has shown that drinking hibiscus tea can reduce high blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes. The study results showed the average systolic blood pressure for those drinking hibiscus tea decreased from 134.8 mmHg (17.97 kPa) at the beginning of the study to 112.7 mmHg (15.03 kPa) at the end of the study, one month later.[5] This is consistent with its supposed role as a diuretic."

review/text: A friend of mine had tried hibiscus tea and said it was a great "fruity" tea. I bought the Davidson's and was pleased with the product. It is a loose tea and can be steeped for 3-5 minutes. I used roughly a teaspoon per 8oz serving. I sweeten it with agave syrup or honey. It's great served over ice too!

review/summary: Fast Service, Great Tasting Product
review/text: I ordered the hibiscus tea based on information that drinking two cups per day would help reduce blood pressure.  I have not been to the doctor yet to see if this working.  The product arrived promptly.  I drink two cups per day sweetened with a little stevia.  My only critical comment would be that<br />the packaging doesn't give instructions for preparing the tea, such as how<br />long it should steep.  I have been steeping it for five minutes.  If that is too long or too short of a time I hope someone will let me know!

review/summary: Clump of dirt found in product
review/text: I recently purchased this product and thought it strange that it showed evidence of grit/dirt (i.e. when I steeped the tea in a glass jar I noticed that after pouring out the tea grit remained on the threads of the jar).  When I opened the 2nd bag that I purchased, about 1 month later, I found a clump of dirt (approximately 1/2" in diameter).  I decided to first call Davidson and see how they would like to resolve the problem.  I received an e-mail response back from Davidson Teas and was told that they have a number of quality control measures in place (sifting and steam sterilization) to prevent problems of this nature.  The response from Davidson Teas unfortunately was "If unsatisfied with product received, please file a claim with Amazon for exchange/refund".  If purchasing product directly from them they stated "we will exchange/refund without any questions asked per our PRODUCT GUARANTEE (on our website)".  Overall I feel it is a good product at a good price from Amazon but Davidson Teas quality control slipped and when given the chance to resolve the problem failed to adequately address the situation.  Not sure if they will look into this situation more closely to prevent this problem in the future or not but check product for evidence of dirt if you are purchasing this product in the future.<br /><br />Update (2/27/12) - Davidson's did get back with me and sent me a new bag without charge when filling out the Amazon claim form.  Have not opened up the new bag to see if the quality has improved, but replacement bag was appreciated.

review/text: I bought this tea not just for the health benefits, but because I'm a fan of red teas, period. I always keep a 1 gallon jug in the fridge for both iced tea and to "nuke" for hot tea. The color is lovely and the taste is heavenly. It doesn't require a lot of sweetening, but I've used both sucralose and stevia and both taste fine (as well as sugar-free raspberry syrup - YUM!). And yes, my very inconsistent blood pressure went down from the 125-130 systolic range down to 115. Pretty amazing stuff, highly recommended.

review/summary: Not the hibiscus I expected
review/text: I grew up drinking Hibiscus most of my life. Of course there are many kinds of hibiscus with different flavors. The good ones usually great deep red clear drink with some acidity and a nice mild distinguished aroma. This hibiscus looks great from the moment you open the package. It is clean small flattened flower individual leafs.  The first thing I noticed is the absence of the hibiscus aroma. It smells like an old black tea that has been opened for long time.<br /><br />  Now for the drink, once added to boiling water, the drink looks good. It has a nice deep red color and the drink is clear.... Now for the taste: There was no taste what so ever. Juts a little acetic taste and that's it.<br /><br />  The drink has the expected effect of making your body getting rid of excess water but I couldn't enjoy it as a drink at all. I had to add more of the hibiscus with a lot of sugar to create a drinkable drink.... Well, that's not what I expect from hibiscus drink. I would give it only one star just because of the flavor. I am going to increase it to two stars because I used it as a tea additive to give a nice acetic flavor and the anti-oxidants.<br /><br />  My explanation of the lack of flavor is that they picked the younger hibiscus flowers that have the deep color and acidity but didn't develop the real hibiscus taste yet.  Or maybe they dried it fast in machines that caused it to loose flavor. But looking at the leaves and how thin they are makes me think that is the first one.<br /><br />  I tried other Hibiscus products from Amazon and there were some really good ones.

review/summary: HIbiscus Tea with Cinnamon
review/text: My boyfriend and I disagree about this hibiscus. Not the quality, that seems to be just fine, and it's nice to have a pound of organic hibiscus delivered right to your door. The disagreement is about whether it's better to buy a pound of organic hibiscus from amazon (his preference) or whether it's better to pay 60% less per pound by buying hibiscus (jamaica) at the local hispaic-centric market, where it comes in bulk bins and you can even buy just a single scoop of it for a dollar if you're short on cash (my preference.)<br /><br />In theory, I agree that organic is better, but the price difference is quite a lot and I have searched online and haven't found anything (yet) that tells me non-organic hibiscus is saturated with pesticides and will kill me. For all I know, maybe it's more like the coffee beans we buy that don't have an organic certification but they are purchased from small farmers in third world countries that couldn't afford pesticides if they wanted to. I just don't know.<br /><br />Either way, hibiscus is delicious. And this particular hibiscus was very satisfactory when we used it. This is the recipe my boyfriend has devised for making a wonderful iced tea with it:<br /><br />Hibiscus Tea with Cinnamon<br /><br />1 cup dried hibiscus<br />3 sticks of cinnamon (also available by the pound on amazon, and in this case I'd have to say the amazon cinnamon is definitely superior to the hispanic market cinnamon)<br />3 T of raw honey or to taste<br />48 ounces water (six cups)<br /><br />Bring water to a boil in a saucepan on the stove. Add hibiscus and cinnamon and simmer 25 minutes (I've forgotten about it until it was more like 50 minutes and it was still good, but too long can make it bitter.)<br />Remove from heat and strain out the hibiscus and cinnamon. Allow to cool to lukewarm, then add honey. (We use raw honey from the local farmer's market. If your honey is probably not raw, it doesn't make any difference whether you wait to add it or not.)<br />Refrigerate and serve chilled over ice.<br /><br />Hibiscus: is high in vitamin c, is said to be good for improving acne, reduces cholesterol, lowers blood pressure and just like other plants is full of anti-oxidants.<br />Cinnamon: can lower blood pressure, regulate blood sugar, and has even been reported to relieve arthritis.<br />Honey: is delicious. :) And if you buy local honey from your local farmer's market, it may even help you with hayfever type allergies. Hey, it's worth a try!

review/text: I use about 5 rounded tbs per one gallon. We use quite a bit of the tea. If you make it in bulk it can be drunk cold or reheated. I boil a gallon of water place the 5 tbs in the pot and turn off the burner. It will continue to boil for a few minutes. I have let it set as long as over night. Remember that this is not black tea - it will not get bitter if you steep it too long. The nice thing about the hibiscus tea is that it really doesn't need refrigeration. Just make sure that you boil it for a couple of minutes to sterilize the brew. By the way I am very cautious about the fantastic claims of many herbal poducts. I can say with some certainty that hibiscus tea does indeed lower blood pressure.

It has a very fruity and tart taste, very similar to cranberry juice, without all the sugar.  Of course, you can add sugar if you like it less tart. I have found that it is best ice cold, although it is drinkable hot too.  The most amazing thing about this purchase is how huge the bag is. You can't really see that from the listing picture. It weighs a solid pound and is almost a foot tall.  SO much tea for the money, this is the best value for hibiscus tea that I have found.  Get it!

review/text: After 1 week blood pressure readings were 10-15 points lower.  After 1 month readings are  20-30 points lower.  (Also removed most salt & sugar from diet + started using Taurine supplement.  Saw most dramatic results with tea.)  I use about 10 petals (less than a TBSP) for a cup-3 X a day. (Whatever amount gives a deep red color.)  As others stated, there is a very small amount of non-petal "debris" mixed in - small stems, etc.  (The gritty substance seems to be tiny seeds, but not sure.)  I just shake the bag contents in a collander to remove small stuff then pick out any other.  Pour tea through a strainer before drinking.  It's tart, so I add stevia.  Per Davidson's Tea:  Their hibiscus is grown in Egypt.  "To protect the integrity of our ingredients, we screen for foreign materials, pests, proper sizing per approved specifications and heavy metal, which must pass stringent EPA and FDA levels. We also use a NOP approved sterilization treatment method as opposed to irradiation and ethylene oxide treatments, which compromise the quality and purity of the ingredients.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I researched this in 2011 and found that it helps lower blood pressure. Two months ago I bought hibiscus tea at a local discount store that sold the tea bags for $1.99 plus tax for 20 teabags. This tea is absolutely delicious. It tastes like sweet & sour fruit somewhat like tart cherries. I've been drinking at least 1 cup a day for the last 2 months and my blood pressure is down an average of 8-10 points. Needing more, I decided to try this based on one of the reviews. When I got it I took 5 leaves (or petals) and boiled them in hot water. I let it cool down for about 10 minutes and strained it. Then I added a teaspoon of honey and a dash of cinnamon. The result was one of the most delicious tasting teas I ever drank. It was smooth and even better than the tea bags. The way I used it I would estimate that I have enough to make at least 50-100 cups. I also like the fact that the tea comes in a zip lock type of bag. You just press the top and it seals in the freshness. Even if this tea wasn't so healthy I'd order it again just for the delicious smooth sweet & sour fruit flavor. For me this is a solid 5 star which I will definitely order again.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: This tea is a great price and had great reviews which is why I opted to try this. In the past, I had purchased my bulk hibiscus from Dragonwater and the quality was amazing. This isn't quite as good as the Dragonwater kind, but since they went out of business, Davidson's seems like the best economical alternative. The petals are really large, but this isn't an issue for me since I use what is essentially a giant tea ball. I make iced hisbiscus tea to make transportable to drink while at work. To make a large quantity at a time, I purchased a 3" spice ball like this one available from Amazon.  [...]<br />I use this spice ball in a large pot of heated-to-proper-tea-temperature-water and steep accordingly and then I have a large container of iced hibiscus tea.<br />I gave this tea 4 starts as opposed to 5 because they could clean up some of the odd bits in there (they seem to throw in other parts than the petals). It's not really a big deal, but doing so would make it more 5 star quality. Good product, great price.

review/summary: Perfect for Sorrel Drink
review/text: I was raised on the Caribbean drink "Sorrel" and there are limited options locally to find a good quality hibiscus flower.  I've resorted to the Internet and have purchased Ocho Rios and Flor de Jamaica but the price and shipping charges deterred me from regularly purchasing these products. This is by far my favorite in regards to quality and consistency and for a better price with Amazon Subscribe and Save.  The Davidson product's flowers are finer than those other products so you need to be careful with portioning if you are use to making sorrel with bigger flowers.  A little goes a long way with this product, which makes it far more economical to purchase this at Amazon. I make pitchers at a time, and sorrel is a cold drink that steeps overnight, so I cannot speak to making individual serving of tea. MexGrocer has a hibiscus product on Amazon that's pretty good, however I am getting more for my money with Davidson and it qualifies for Amazon prime so I save on shipping.  I didn't have any issues with the taste or potency as some other reviewers have stated.  I was raised on hibiscus flowers, and my sorrel tastes exactly how its suppose to.  Highly recommend.

I read some of the other reviews before I made the purchase, and most of them were good, so I decided to try it.<br /><br />The other reviews mentioned that this tea was tart and fruity.  I found it very tart, but not overly fruity.  Perhaps this tea has lost some of its flavor since the bag didn't seem very air tight.<br /><br />Other reviews also mention a floral smell when brewing the tea, to me it smelled a little like compost, which was slightly off-putting.  The dry tea didn't have much of a smell either- it did smell barely of dried flowers.<br /><br />The color is nice- a deep and clear red, and the flavor is ok- but I found the sourness is more appealing to me as an iced tea drink.<br /><br />I also like to put skim milk in my tea, and I don't recommend doing that, since the acidity/sourness of the tea caused it to curdle.<br /><br />The printing on the bag seemed faded, and the other reviews mention difference in bags that the tea comes in.  This particular shipment was in the fold down bag, not the zip-lock bag, like some of their other teas.  This makes me think that they are either gradually changing over to the new bags, and I got an old bag of tea- or they are inconsistent with rotating their product.<br /><br />I look forward to trying a couple more hibiscus teas that are out there so I know more about the way that it is supposed to taste.

Simmer 30 minutes, strain, chill.  Serve over ice.  Delicious!

review/text: Let me start out by saying this bulk tea bag comes with a lot of Hibiscus flowers.  A little bit of hibiscus goes a long way.  I've even reused the the flowers after I am done with my drink.  I recomend this product for anyone who likes hibiscus or sour drinks in general (of course it can be sweetened up too, just like lemonaide.)<br /><br />Pros:<br />Excelent Value<br />Quality flowers<br />Great taste<br />A lot of product<br /><br />Cons:<br />Some flowers are a little gritty -- easily solved with tea strainer/sifter

review/summary: Awesome Tea!
review/text: Great tea. I've had it on Subscribe and Save for about three months now, and the strength and quality has been consistently good. I enjoy the whole leaves, use a stainless coffee strainer in a latte mug, steep and sip away! I brew it on the strong side, but it has a cranberry tartness to it. With all the health benefits it has (lowered blood pressure) it's good to drink as an alternative to all of the other junk sodas and sugary juices.

review/summary: Brew With Stevia, Drink instead of Soda
review/text: I use the hibiscus flower tea thus:<br /><br />In a slightly larger than two quart (half gallon) container place 3/4 to 1 cup hibiscus flowers and 3/4-1 tablespoon dried stevia leaves.<br /><br />Add two quarts of boiling water.<br /><br />Let sit for at least 10 minutes.  Drink some hot (if you like).  When it is cool, strain through a fine sieve or mesh into a refrigerator container and enjoy cold.<br /><br />My daughters (12 & 14) enjoy drinking this cold over ice instead of soda and take it to school in the morning in their water bottles.  I drink it cold after running, working in the yard, or going to the gym as it is extraordinarily refreshing cold.  It also tends to keep me from snacking between meals.  We go through about 2-3 gallons/week, mostly cold.<br /><br />Other recommendations:  It stains, so pour it over the sink or something that won't stain.  It is very convenient online, but can also be purchased from many local Mexican markets from the same section as dried peppers.  Consider keeping in a sealed container (I use Lock & Lock) for freshness and to keep from getting wet (again because it will stain). Stevia leaves are not the same as Stevia powder (the powder is much stronger).<br /><br />update:<br />I've used the "Frontier Bulk Stevia Herb Powder(Green), CERTIFIED ORGANIC, 1 lb. package" from Amazon instead of the dried stevia leaves from my garden. While brewing 1/2 gallon (2 quarts) of tea, I still used 1 cup of dried hibiscus flowers and 1 level teaspoon of stevia herb powder. Tastes the same as when I use the dried leaves from my garden.  Note:  green stevia powder is not the same as stevia extract.

review/summary: Ah, Hibiscus Tea...
review/text: I was concerned about purchasing this bag as opposed to the bag of cut and sifted flowers for a few dollars more, because the review on that product suggested this bag may contain stems, bulbs, and other less desirable parts.  I have found this to be untrue - the bag I received (which did have a ziploc-style top) contained only pure petals.  I put mine into a metal tea holder and steeped it in hot water, and the tea came out vibrant and delicious.  I intend to make lots of this and then chill it, as I prefer it cold.  A little sugar can make this drink a little sweeter, which I find I prefer when the tea is hot.  Also... it's really pretty.  I'm excited to serve this non-traditional beverage to my houseguests.  The bag is huge, too, and given that I'm usually the only one in the house that will drink it (my husband is a coffee fiend), I might freeze half of it until I need it.<br /><br />I've found this bag is really simple and much preferable to more processed teas.

I vacuum packed 3/4 of each and stored them in the freezer. The partial bags are in the fridge ready to use. I'm looking forward to drinking these fine organic teas for some time to come and save big $s as well.

review/summary: Tangy, fruity flavor
review/text: I just purchased this because I have recently been diagnosed with high blood pressure and really want to go the natural route.  By itself, I found it a little too fruity, tangy flavored, but that is just my personal preference.  I really wanted to like it enough to want to drink it all the time, at least 3 cups a day.  Being a tea drinker anyway, and having lots of tea at my disposal I started blending it with other teas.  For evening I use a heaping t. each of red rooibos and  African honeybush (both Davidson's) and 5 or 6 pieces of this tea and steep for maybe 10 min.  Add a dollop of raw honey--delicious.  I will sometimes steep this a second time.  I enjoy it every evening before bed.  For daytime I just make my regular gunpowder green (again, Davidson's) or my oolong, or whatever I feel like that day.  Sometimes I even mix them, and add 6 or so pieces of hibiscus leaves and a dollop of honey.  The hibiscus adds just the right fruity tangy taste and results in a wonderful tasty tea that I enjoy drinking throughout the day.  I am hopeful that using it this way I will be drinking enough of it to reap the health benefits that it provides. The bag is huge and I am sure will last me a long time.  When I finish it off, I will for sure buy some more.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I just received my first bag of this tea and all I can say is WOW!  This has a most delicious and comforting taste.  I brewed about 8 leaves in a teapot of boiling water - steeped for about 6 minutes, poured it into a mug and tasted.  I was reluctant at first, but I've had the Celestial Seasonings Zinger teas, so I was somewhat familiar with hibiscus.  Well, this is so much better.  I am so happy with this organic hibiscus tea.  And, you don't even need a tea strainer.  The flowers are whole, so you just steep and pour.  I used a teapot that my aunt had given to me and it worked beautifully. The flowers just stay at the bottom of the pot. I ordered this just 3 days ago from Amazon and it arrived just over an hour ago - perfect condition and ready for me to brew my first - not to be my last - cup of hibiscus tea!  Great product.

review/text: Good price, beats the heck out of the local co-op.  The 'tea' itself  consists of large pieces of hibiscus relative to what you expect as tea, and after you break it up, it only takes a couple to fill the tea ball.  This is like buying 3 pounds of regular tea that has already been flaked.  Great flavor too.  I think my co-op buys this, grinds it, and resells it at 3 times the price.

review/text: The hibiscus tea is exactly as described and Amazon shipped the item very quickly. This newer packaging appears to be mylar or aluminum lined. This helps to keep the tea fresh between brewings.<br /><br />I bought it for its positive health benefits. Since drinking 3 to 4 cups a day my diastolic bp has decreased about 10 points and my cystolic bp has dropped about 8 points. To be completely transparent I am also drinking the same amount of Davison's Bulk Rooibos Tea per day.<br /><br />Both teas taste great. The hibiscus smells like fragrant flowers and tastes just a bit sour but that's fine.  The rooibos has a different frangrance and tastes smoother and more delicate compared to the hibiscus.<br /><br />I just ordered more rooibos tea and will order more hibiscus when the bag gets low.

Received it yesterday, followed the package directions to brew my first pitcher of tea to put into the fridge. I added sugar to tame a bit of the tartness. My plan is to drink 3 cups a day (morning, afternoon, and night) and then see what happens with blood pressure in a month.

review/summary: Off the Hook delicious Tea - and great Energy Health
review/text: Wow, this is some fantastic tea. It is a very common drink in Mexico and Central America. They tend to dump in the sugar. I have to add some organic sugar or organic Agave syrup. But wow, this makes for a delicious tea - the color is a real WOW.<br /><br />Served cold, it is really refreshing and cleanses the palate if you are eating spicy food.<br /><br />Search on line see what amazing healing properties this tea has. For myself, it really helped with this horrific allergy season.<br /><br />So you can enjoy a yummy tasting tea and help yourself be naturally healthy and strong.

review/summary: Beautiful Tea!
review/text: I must say that I nearly passed on this tea because of some of the reviews. In the end, I decided to give it a try, because it is more affordable than some of the others. I can honestly say that I have no idea why anyone would complain about this product. These are not ground up pieces of junk that you get in tea bags, but rather, they are large pieces of flower petals. It is so pretty, that I put it in a clear glass apothecary jar, right out on my kitchen counter! I was also pleased that the bag seems larger than it looks in the picture. I purchased this to see if it will help lower my husband's blood pressure. That remains to be seen, but so far, we both are enjoying this delicious beverage. We used to drink gallons of regular sun-tea year-round. We have replaced that with this hibiscus tea. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the brewed tea is pretty too. It has the salmon-pink color of a blush wine - you almost want to serve it in wine glasses!

review/text: I bought this bulk tea to help with blood pressure issues and to have something I could just throw in a pitcher and not have to heat or "fix" sort of like Sun tea without the sun. Between this and my wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J3JFJU">Finum Brewing Large Basket, Black</a> filter, I am super happy. I'm now permanently keeping a big pitcher in the fridge. And no one would ever guess it's health-food. This tea is esp great with some Liquid Stevia, I bet you could wean your kids off Koolaid since it's so good & pretty and colorful red.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and it's so inexpensive without all the weird chemicals in diet drinks and drink mixes these days.

Their price is higher than if you bought the coffee at your local Starbucks or grocery store.Direct from a Starbucks store the price is less and you get 25% more coffee (12oz vs 16oz bags). I won't do business with "OCHUN" and suggest you don't either until they get their prices in line. VERY VERY EXPENSIVE FROM "OCHUN" Shop around.

review/text: All a sudden I started to drink black coffee, and it started with the Starbucks Sumatra.<br /><br />I know, you are probably thinking, "EW. Starbucks?!" Yes! I was shocked as well!!<br /><br />I French press my own coffee since the bill started adding up each time I went to Starbucks and bought a cup each time ($4.11 to be exact). WOW, the taste is absolutely amazing! I do not even want to put in any cream/milk/sugar... NOTHING into my cup of Sumatra coffee. The taste is rich, bold, and it has a pleasant bitter kick to the end with no bad after taste. It definitely has an earthy flavor as claims to have which make this coffee even more wholesome to me.<br /><br />What makes it even MORE awesome is that it tastes expensive, but the price is out of this world! I bought my own pack at my local grocery store on sale for $7.99. Can you believe how much money I have saved? I really look forward to waking up in the morning and drinking this cup o' joe.

review/summary: Great For the First Cup of the First Day
review/text: Starbucks Sumatra is a little better than a few others I've tried. Sumatra is a great earthy change of pace. Unfortunately, it loses flavor and the potent aroma the minute you open the bag. It also sours quickly if you leave it on the heat for more than a few minutes. This is not a flavor I can drink daily, but that is unfortunate because the flavor doesn't last long enough in the bag to use it within a week either(pot a day). So in the end, I'd rather just buy this flavor as a fresh cup down the street at the local shop once in a while. As a daily drinker, my palate is in-tune with the Melitta's Enchanted Evening.

review/text: First let me say that I love Starbucks coffee.  I used to buy nothing but the French Roast but once I tried the Sumatra, I found it to be a bit smoother.  The first time that I purchased it from Amazon, it was at the $19.99 sale price and I purchased two of the 3-packs which came out to $0.56/oz. (a very good price.)  I went to reorder it today and the price is currently $26.12/3-pack which comes to $0.73/oz. a much higher price than in the stores.  I see no reason in purchasing from Amazon when I can get the same thing from Wal-Mart for a much lower price.  When Amazon runs the sale again, I will stock up since I go through at least 3-4 12 oz. packs a month.

It's expiration is about 4-6 months from the day I got it, so I would make sure you can get through it all if you are considering the purchase.  Overall, the coffee smelled great, I didn't drink it, but I haven't heard any complaints from him!<br /><br />Please remember that this is GROUND, not whole bean. The value is much greater this way because the amount of coffee you are receiving, but some people rather crush it themselves.  It is up to you, but the box smelled like they just ground it at Starbucks the day before!

review/text: I'm a big fan of Sumatra beans and Starbucks compares favorably with the locally available Peet's. The problem with all the Starbucks ground coffee I've seen is that there's no indicator on the package or in the product description as to the fineness of the grind. In fact, it's a medium grind like the generic canned supermarket brands, suitable for drip and percolator type coffee makers. In my local supermarket, Starbucks is available and some varieties are whole beans, but not Sumatra.<br /><br />I use an espresso machine and had to re-grind the Starbucks to make a decent brew. I won't be purchasing ground Starbucks again.

review/summary: RATE STARBUCKS, BUT OF COURSE!
review/text: OKay, I must admit I'm reviewing this because somehow the idea of reviewing COFFEE seems ridiculous and funny and sort of pretentious, like those people who get into the subtle, indiscernible differences in wines.  So I"m going to act like a real connoisseur of coffee and tell you that, yes it's BOLD, with subtle notes of  . . . . of . . . well, of caffeine!  OH, I can't even pretend to be a connoisseur.  But I will tell you this.  I LOVE Starbucks coffee.  And this is BY FAR the least expensive Starbucks I've ever found anywhere.  I bought EIGHT BAGS.  Seriously.<br />Enjoy!

review/summary: not happy with this order
review/text: As it is clearly written this coffee was supposed to be ground, but when I received it NOPE, it was not ground.  I chose this coffee because it was supposed to be ground, I paid a higher rate for it.  I will not purchase from this seller again.<br /><br />I love sumatra coffee, it is the best of the best as far as I am concerned.  I am not happy because I didn't get what I paid for.

review/summary: Awful, not as described, NOT TROLLI GUMMIES!!!!
review/text: This was the worst order I've ever experienced. The Trolli Gummy Bears sent were not from Trolli. They were some other brand, and they were disgusting! Truly awful. Do not order from Bayside Candy. They will sell you a false product.

review/summary: TROLLI GUMMI BEARS!
review/text: I am so pleased to find a supplier of TROLLI GUMMI BEARS.  Penguin Mints is the supplier and I am very satisfied with their excellent service.  I received the shipment very promptly and, despite the fact that it was during warm weather, the product arrived in perfect condition.  They have my vote and I will always order from them.  Tx Amazon for making my favorite candy available thru such an excellent supplier.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M15XPY">Trolli Gummi Bears, 5 Lbs</a>
