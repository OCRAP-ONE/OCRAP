review/summary: Hot water
review/text: I tried to like this tea being that I bought a whole box, but I am still working on it going 4 months now. I drink at least one cup of tea at work everyday and I am partial to mint in my tea. However, there is little to no tea or mint flavor going on here. I have shared this with many people at work and it isn't just me.<br /><br />There are particles left behind in the tea bag with more aroma than the brewed tea itself. I always leave the bag in the cup as I drink it and it never gets stronger. There is nothing satisfying about it, I might as well just drink hot water.<br /><br />I do like stash teas but don't make my mistake, try it first. The packages I received are different than pictured now, maybe it has improved. I am disappointed.

review/summary: My girlfriend keeps drinking all of it!
review/text: I drink at least two cups of tea a day and have tried hundreds of types.  After years of drinking black I have switched to green and white and now I would not go back.  The white is just much cleaner and does not give you an aftertaste.  The green I like to drink after dinner or a meal.  This gives me two of the teas I love in one package.  Now if my gf would stop drinking all of it I would be even more happier :)

review/text: For some reason, I was just not able to fully enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I tried to brew it different ways starting with the water temperature and brewing length.<br /><br />At best this tea was just okay when lightly brewed and some might enjoy the subtle flavor this way.<br /><br />I thought most jasmine blossoms take time to develop but the longer I brewed this tea, the more bitter it became and tasted so strange I had to dump it on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Due the ratings for this tea being very high on amazon.com, I wanted to like this tea and tried my best to enjoy it.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch, but for now I'll pass on this tea.<br /><br />* * 2 / 5 * * * * *<br /><br />Ciao

review/summary: OK Tea, not bad
review/text: I picked up some of this tea at the grocery store last week. It has some grassy aftertaste that many green teas have but not as much as some brands. I was careful with water temp and how long I let it steep and it wasn't bitter. It tastes somewhat clean and fresh but I like the much less expensive Salada better and I don't have to be careful with it like I do with Stash teas.

review/summary: Stash Premium Fusion Red, White & Blueberry Tea
review/text: Amazing tea.<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up - it's an amazing tea. The taste is sweet and the smell is strong and also sweet. I love waking up, steeping a teabag with two teaspoons of cane sugar and half water half milk mixture. Adding milk gives the tea an amazing body and unlike a reviewer said below, there is no notes of green olives nor of cough syrup - this tea is simply astounding.<br /><br />I've tried Stash's Mango/Passion fusion and their Chai tea but didn't care for those, then I stumbled upon this one and O-M-G is all I had to say. The Chai has a somewhat bitter aftertaste and the Mango/Passion is forgettable on the palette. This tea however I love. The smell like I said is strong, super strong, and sweet. The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing. However, on the downside, I would not recommend that you make this tea with water alone, although it is a very smooth tea, it lacks body - thus, like I said before, make it as follows:<br /><br />Steep in 4oz hot water with 2 teaspoons of cane sugar (or substitute your own)<br />Add 4oz warm milk<br /><br />The milk as I said gives it extra body that the tea lacks, however it is forgiveable. Stash truly hit the mark on this one and hopefully they don't discontinue it - because the day they do discontinue it, I will be a very very sad man :(

review/summary: Wakes me Up Without Making Me Jittery and Tastes Good Too
review/text: Stash Green Chai tea is very tasty, especially when it's mixed with some milk and honey.  Even better, it has the perfect amount of caffeine for me--just enough to wake me up without making me sweaty and jittery like coffee does.<br /><br />The individually-wrapped, foil-packaged tea bags are convenient, even if that much packaging does seem like overkill.  The packaging allows me to take a couple of tea bags with me wherever I go, just in case I get stuck in a boring meeting with no other beverage options except for nasty office coffee or plain hot water. . . Yes, I'm too cheap to go to Starbucks!

review/text: I normally really dislike mint tea.  Usually it has a lot of peppermint and is too strong.  But this one is milder and has spearmint, predominantly.  Not strong, though, and very, very smooth.<br /><br />A bit of honey or sweetener is nice with this one.<br /><br />I don't get distinct tastes of other things that they put in the tea -- the flavor is more of a gestalt.  It is a mint flavor that is more complex than the typical strong plain mint tea.<br /><br />Very, very nice.

review/text: I'm always seeing everywhere how good green tea is for you and how we should all be drinking it (not too exciting though, I know).  I stumbled across this Stash tea variation that combined my favorite (Chai) WITH green tea.  Now I can get some daily green tea down as recommended along with my daily chai fix -truly a perfect union.  I had no idea such a combination even existed -how could I go wrong?!  Needless to say, it has quickly become a new favorite.  :)"

review/summary: Jasmine
review/text: I love this tea. I used to buy loose jasmine green tea but this bagged variety is much more economical and tastes almost as good. It's great for people that are not big fans of traditional green tea, since it is much lighter and more flavorful. I don't even add any sweetener I like the plain taste just fine. The caffeine content is not as high as the one of coffee, or even regular green tea, which makes this a good beverage choice at all times of the day.

review/text: This is a good product.  But I thought it was not as smooth as Tzao (sp?) or even Bigelow Organic Green Tea (from Sam's Club).  The Bigelow is also much less expensive (175 bags for about $7.00).  I've had better tea than all of these in Asia, but don't know the brand names.<br /><br />Also, if you go to China or Japan, green tea is usually not green.  It varies from dark brown to pale green, including many shades of amber depending on growing conditions, processing and harvesting time.<br />[...]

My grandmother went to morrocco and really liked the tea there, and even she thought that this was good stuff.  The only thing I have to say that's negative would be the box design makes it difficult to grab the packets from the little like half circle opening, just open up the back otherwise they get all messed up and you have to push your fingers and root around trying to grab one of them and then pull them out etc.  Really good tea for a really nice price.  Even though I just bought 6 boxes, I would buy this again for sure (me and my family have already gone through three, and I gave one away as a gift).

review/text: I really like this tea.  I tried all the stash Fushion ones and liked this one best.  To get the full flavor you have to steep it for a long time. This tea also makes a great ice tea.  I make it like regular and then put it in the fridge when it cools down. You can use 2 tea bags in a standard tea pot and it makes a great strength of tea.  The listing says only 5 left, nearly out of stock, does this mean it's being discontinued? I am frustrated with Stash coming out with new flavors left and right and stores can only stock so many. Every time I find one I like, the stores stop carrying. I hope this continues to be available from Amazon.

review/summary: OK, but nothing amazing
review/text: Like many of the other reviewers, as part of a Bzzagent campaign, I also received a sample of the Pike Place ground coffee to try out.  When Pike was first introduced at Starbucks a couple years ago, I had a cup every Wednesday as part of their introduction campaign and even now it is my go-to choice if their other daily brewed selections aren't interesting to me.  Freshly-brewed in the store, it indeed is very smooth and pleasant without tasting especially burned or bitter.  I had high hopes when I heard Pike would be part of the line available in the grocery.  However, I think there is just something lost in the translation from store to grocery bag.  I have brewed several cups using both a drip pot and drip filter and just find the resulting coffee rather bland.  I suppose this could be attributed to the pre-ground beans roasted god knows when.  At least in the brick and mortar Starbucks, the beans are (typically) fresh with a clealy indicated roasting date.  This is probably the coffee snob in me talking, but coffee is at its absolute best when freshly roasted beans are ground just prior to brewing.  The resulting grounds have a rich dark almost wet look to them from the coffee bean oils, which produces an intense and flavorful coffee.  The exact opposite is true of the Pike's grocery bag--light brown and very dry.  Not that it's a bad thing, again for the casual drinker, this is a "good" coffee--nothing that is particularly intense or memorable.  This is the type of coffee I'd probably serve at a holiday dinner with mixed company.  However, this isn't something I'd keep on hand for my own use--I'm going to stick with my mail orders for freshly roasted beans from Peet's Coffee.

review/text: Starbucks Pike Roast Coffee is one of my favorite tasting coffees. It has a very mild flavor. Thus you will not want to add too much cream or sugar otherwise you will lose the taste. If you are a coffee drinker that does like a ton of sugar and cream and a drip of coffee, this coffee is probably not for you because you would be better off buying a cheap brand. The price is kinda high yet you do get what you pay for. The coffee did not have a burnt or a bitter taste. I got the Starbucks coffee as a sample via Bzz agent which I shared with friends and family on Easter breakfast. Everyone enjoyed the coffee as it offered them rejuvenation with a java jolt.

review/text: I will first start by saying I am NOT a fan of Starbucks. Everytime I had coffee there, it tasted old and much, much too strong, and it is ridiculously overpriced. I drink my coffee with cream only, no sugar or other flavorings. When I was offered the opportunity to review Pikes Place for BuzzAgent, I thought it would be a good idea, since I do love coffee and I have never tried Starbucks coffee brewed at home. I'm glad I did!  Pikes Place is a nice, smooth blend with a great taste, very good for any time of day. It's just coffee, no crazy flavorings, and has a slight nutty taste. I did receive this as a product test, but I will most definitely purchase it as it is quite delicious!

review/text: This is a great everyday roast. It is not my favorite from Starbucks but holds it own with just a splash of half & half, takes flavored syrups well and even goes great with super sweet desserts. Most people try to choose a coffee with a lot of complimentary flavors to pair with a dessert but many desserts are so sweet and complex on their own that they just need a solid smooth coffee to let them shine, this roast is spot-on for that. I received this as a product test but will most definitely purchase it already brewed and for use at home.

review/summary: Nice Smooth Flavor
review/text: I really enjoyed the flavor and aroma of Starbuck's Pike Place Roast.  It really does have a nice smooth flavor.  I don't taste any bitterness at all with this coffee.  It is not a strong coffee if that is what you are looking for.  The flavors of cocoa and toasted nuts are subtle but delicious.  All in all I would recommend this coffee.

review/summary: Specialty roast with subtle taste of cocoa and nuts
review/text: Pike Place Roast is a Seattle specialty roast coffee that has a medium flavor and a subtle taste of cocoa and nuts. I am a HUGE Starbucks fan but there is something about the taste and smell of this blend that can't stand. I usually love trying new and exciting blends of coffee but this one was extremely disappointing.

review/summary: Pike's Place Roast....Uh...no....
review/text: I'll only get  a Vente Pikes Place Roast if it's all Starbucks has and I'll never every buy the beans at the store. To me it lacks a full flavor and characteristically has a bitter/acidic after taste. Because I dislike Pike's Place roast so much I bought a french press and bought some original House blend. To my horror, House now tastes very similar to Pike's Place. I'm going to retry the Italian blend next.<br /><br />I will give credit though where credit is due. If Starbucks roasts and brews Pike's Place like they're supposed to the coffee tastes OKish. But often times, I either get burnt tasting coffee, acidic tasting coffee, or coffee that has a lingering aftertaste of soap suds.<br /><br />Let me just leave you with a qoute from the House Blend package before the quote disappears as the flavor has:<br /><br />"When we opened our first store in Seattle's Pike's Place Market, we wanted a House Blend that captured the signature expression of our roasting style--glistening, dark chestnut beans loaded with flavor. Years later, it's still why people come through our doors"<br /><br />Question Starbucks,<br /><br />1.> If House is still your signature expression of your roasting style, why'd you leave it behind?<br />2.> If House is why people walk through your doors, why are you serving Pike's Place?

review/summary: Coffee Prosumer Says "Rebranded McDonalds Coffee!"
review/text: Some background on my coffee history: I got my start in being a coffee nut when I volunteered to help out in a friend's coffee shop. He trained me on a beautiful italian espresso machine, taught me to adjust the grind and tamp to get good espresso, about different roasts, and the simple marvel of the french press. His shop closed not long afterward, but I took my knowledge and love of coffee with me. I've gone through several methods of brewing coffee, including the AeroPress, french press, stovetop "espresso" maker, etc. I currently have a Gaggia espresso machine at home, but my current favorite coffee vessel is a simple Bodum drip vessel with a gold filter (boil the water yourself, pour over grounds). Simple, easy to clean thoroughly, and makes a very good cup of coffee.<br /><br />When I heard that McDonalds coffee was getting good reviews, and that people were supposedly more satisfied with their coffee than with Starbucks (not an impressive feat in and of itself, but impressive enough for a fast food chain), I decided to give it a try. I wasn't impressed. What I got was a 2 dimensional caricature of the real thing. It was almost coffee, but it was missing a lot of the subtle nuance I was used to tasting, even in mass-produced "office coffee". The only good thing I could say about it was that it was inoffensive. It had none of the bitter nastiness associated with cheap brew.<br /><br />Then Starbucks came out with the Pike Place Roast. I guess they heard about those customer satisfaction surveys, and some bonehead decided that it'd be a good idea to try to reverse engineer McDonalds coffee and pass it off as this new special house blend. That's the only explanation I can think of for how similar Pike Place and McDonalds coffee taste. Like a 2 dimensional caricature of the real thing.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />-Like coffee, without the complexity.<br />-Inoffensive.<br />-Almost exactly like McDonalds coffee.<br /><br />I just pretend like Pike Place Roast doesn't exist. That way I don't get headaches trying to figure out why Starbucks makes coffee that tastes like it comes with the golden arches on the cup.

review/text: These are the best lolloipops ever!They are pretty as well!  I have loved these since I was a kid in the 70's. You used to be able to buy them in deli's or convienient stores.<br /><br />The flavor is hard to describe. They have a sweet fruity taste all their own. Each color does taste different from the other though! I have tried 3 flavor three. The red/white/yellow & the red/green/white are my favorite.  The green/orange/white flavor tastes more like lime with a touch of some other sweetness, but they are all good.<br /><br />As for the orange/white one, my package did not have that flavor so I have no idea what it tastes like. I have never seen it and I've been buying these for a couple years now. If you have never tried these and love fruity sweet lollipops it's sure to be a nice surprise!

This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish.

review/summary: Sweet Home Louisiana
review/text: I have been living in California for 30 years now, but never forgot the coffee my Mom used to fix when I was a kid in New Orleans, half coffee & Chicory and half boiled cows milk, what the french call Cafe A'Lait.  Of course I also remember drinking that same coffee and stuffing down biegnets at the Cafe DuMonde and the Morning Call in the French Quarter.  Now being in California this long you tend to get Californicated, you know, premium wines, exotic coffee beans, etc., etc.  But when I happened on the old familiar can of CDM on Amazon I thought, what the heck, lets see if it brings back any memories, so I ordered a few cans.  Am I glad I did.  Not only did it bring back memories, but it made me realize that I would have never have found the taste I had been looking for in all those exotic beans I bought because there is no coffe bean in the world that can match the wonderfully strong and complex body of Coffee and Chicory.  Probably not for everyone, but absolutely indespensible for us old New Orleans boys.

review/summary: Removing "bitterness" in coffee
review/text: I read a review from someone who stated that the CDM coffee was bitter, not like the version that he/she got at the Cafe Du Monde coffee shop in downtown New Orleans.  Here is the secret.  When brewing any coffee, add a pinch of salt.  You will not taste the salt and the bitterness will be gone.  BTW, the coffee  is the same as that used at the Cafe Du Monde, but two things are different.  1) They grind beans from CDM fresh each day for their brewers and 2) you are using a different brewing system than they do.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZOKNW4">CDM Coffee & Chicory, Regular Grind, 13-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Roach Magnet
review/text: We were having a problem in our garage with Oriental Roaches (aka "waterbugs") these are the big black roaches usually found outdoors in yards near water sources.  They were coming in under the garage door this summer to escape the heat and search for water.  These traps were excellent for attracting and traping these roaches.  In fact, I was replacing them every couple of days because they were full of roaches and also spiders and other insects.  Just be aware that traps of any kind are helpful in lowering a roach population, but they will not eliminate them.  Traps are also very useful in gauging how big of a problem you have.<br />  To rid yourself of the Oriental roach or other species of roaches, you will need Advion Cockroach Gel Bait by Dupont.  This is a relatively low toxcicity bait that will wipe out a roach infestation. It can be purchased from a number of DIY pest control websites and is the same stuff used by the professionals.  Also very important in roach control<br />is the following list of things you need to do in addition to the bait mentioned above:<br /><br />***Don't let them in. Cockroaches may enter houses via sewer connections, under doors, around utility pipes, air ducts, or other openings in the foundation. They love cracks and can squeeze in just about anywhere. Young roaches can fit into a space as thin as a dime. An adult male needs a crack about the thickness of a quarter. Attach well-fitting door sweeps. Fill holes where pipes disappear into walls with silicon sealant, steel/bronze wool. Search for cracks along foundations, baseboards, pipes, windows, vents, cabinets and doors and seal larger gaps and dust smaller cracks with Boric Acid. Install or repair window and door screens. Install fine mesh screens over vents, ducts and floor drains. Keep sink plugs over drains in sinks, showers, etc., which are not used often.<br /><br />***Keep them away from food. A roach can find a snack just about anywhere. They eat crumbs, pet food, dead leaves and trash. Store food in tightly sealed containers or in the refrigerator and put pet food away overnight. Don't leave open bags of food or candy lying around. Clean up spills and crumbs right away, especially from under appliances, and wipe all counters and tables after use. Rinse food and drink containers before disposal, empty trash and recycling frequently, and use trashcans with tight-fitting lids. Clean your dirty dishes right away and keep the stove grease and food free. Wash or replace sponges and dishrags often.<br /><br />***Keep them thirsty. Roaches need water to live. Without it, they die within a week even though they can live up to a month without food. Fix dripping faucets. Water yards in the early morning, not at night when roaches are active. Don't over water yards. Prevent condensation from your A/C unit from pooling near your foundation.<br /><br />***Make it hard for them to hide. Roaches spend most of their lives hiding. If roaches can't hide, they'll find someplace else to live.<br />Move woodpiles, stockpiled bricks and other clutter away from outside walls. Raise boxes and stored items off your garage floors and away from walls. Take your recycling out promptly; avoid letting old food cans, stacks of newspapers or magazines pile up. Use a light dusting of Boric Acid under appliances, under sinks, cupboards and other low lying areaas where roaches like to hide.

review/summary: JUST SAY NO
review/text: Boy, did this sound like a great product.  We have a problem with roaches in our apartment and we wanted to give this a shot and avoid combat.  Bought a pack and were amazed at how quickly they were filled.  We had no idea we had so many roaches!<br />So after 3 mos or whatever, we were still having roach problems, so we bought more.  We were interested in how many roaches seemed to be HATCHING in the traps.  Gross, right?  We never had so many roaches.<br />So guess what.  We threw the traps away.  And away went the roaches.<br />We've checked everywhere, and they just seem to be gone.<br />The pheromones were ATTRACTING roaches to my apartment.  We had roaches, yes, but not the infestation we ended up with after using these things!  They seriously are a roach magnet, roaches will come from everywhere to get near them, hatch more babies in your home/apartment, and then you'll need to buy more roach magnets!  Amazing.<br />And gross.<br />Just don't do it.  This is a waste of money and will make your house unsafe with roaches, roach poop, you name it.<br />Totally gross.

review/text: The placement of these traps is key to their success. As per the instructions, if you don't see anything in the trap in 24-72 hours, move the trap. If you do see something within that time frame, place more traps nearby as this is likely close to an "infestation".<br /><br />I'm not really sure how well these traps attract bugs and spiders. At one point, there were several stink bugs congregating just inches from one of the traps; they showed no interest in the trap, choosing instead to discuss politics and global warming.<br /><br />I really stress that placement is critical. I have found that putting these in dark corners and under things where creepy crawly creatures like to hide tends to net the most kills!

review/text: We bought these mostly for house centipedes after moving into a home in the suburbs. Some reviewers have complained about ineffectiveness on roaches - I can't comment on how effective they are on them since we don't seem to have roaches.<br /><br />For us, they have caught many centipedes, millipedes, ants, silverfish, spiders and beetles. They're easy to put out and seem effective for around 2 months, at which point we replace them since they can be fairly full in "high traffic" areas like the garage or basement.

To my amazement, and mortification,  I am constantly replacing the traps which are catching an unbelievable variety of insects.  I do not know where they hide.  Because we have cats, I am pleased that these traps are not toxic, and that I do not have to spray toxic products on the carpet and along the baseboards.  I realize that this will not eliminate the problem entirely, but it also will not poison us or our pets.

review/summary: It got that cockroach the first night!
review/text: I'm very happy with the traps.  I put them out all over and<br />got the one cockroach that somehow snuck into the house<br />on the very first night that I set the traps out.  I also caught<br />two silverfish.  The trap gets five stars just for the cockroach.<br /><br />The neighborhood I'm in has these huge vw bug cockroaches<br />with dark shells.  I have to be careful to keep doors closed<br />at night so they won't sneak in.  I hate them because they<br />run when you scream or when you're about to smash them<br />with a shoe on the trash can.<br /><br />Anyways, first thing this morning after having the trap set up<br />last night I see this big cockroach was stuck in the trap and<br />still moving.  I panicked because I couldn't smash it with<br />anything since it was 3/4 in the trap and its head was sticking<br />out and I had nothing to smash with handy.  I squirted maybe 1/4<br />cup of dish detergent onto it because I remembered reading<br />somewhere on internet that cockroaches breathe through their<br />skin.  After it got coated in soap I then was afraid the soap<br />would dissolve the sticky stuff in the trap and set the bugger<br />loose, but happily it struggled and died in the trap.<br />I only had to clean soap off that I squirted but that's okay<br />because cockroaches leave scent trails that need to be washed<br />off to prevent other buggers from following the trail.<br />If you don't squirt the cockroach, the trap and surrounding<br />area will be nice and clean and dry.  The sticky stuff inside<br />the traps stays inside.<br /><br />The traps are a bit hard to separate since you are tearing along<br />a perforation in cardboard after removing a divider strip to<br />separate two traps, but once you get the hang of how to do it,<br />it is okay. I was able to easily handle the traps and not get any<br />of the sticky stuff from inside the traps onto my hands.  Its<br />great that there is no toxic poisonous stuff in the traps.

The only thing I don't like about this product is having the separate them. The first few tries ended up in smashed boxes. I now just use a pair of scissors to separate them. I have purchased these once before and decided to purchase them again. Until my HOA gets its act together and does something about the roaches, these little traps will have to do. And they work well.

review/summary: A very effective product
review/text: We tried using these Insect Magnets a year ago with great results. They are basically a next generation of the old "Roach Motels"- a glue trap with an insect attractant inside. We initially tried them to combat scorpions since most poisons are only moderately effective on them due to their bodyweight. The product worked like a charm.<br />Two unintended benefits we noticed were that:<br />(1) Since they trap almost all bugs, they give you an idea of what type of bugs- and how many- are in the area that you use the trap in. In our case, we were surprised that almost no bugs were trapped in the kitchen, but many were trapped in the laundry room(where we later upgraded the weather stripping).<br />(2) The attractant really works well. After spotting a scorpion near a dresser(eek!) we placed a trap next to the sighting. About an hour later, it was safely stuck in the trap.<br />The only cons we found were that the traps are a little oddly joined into pairs, the attractant only seems to last for 2-3 months, and after the plastic packaging is removed any unused traps begin to attract bugs to them.<br />Overall a very good product, especially without the use of pesticides.

review/text: I purchased these at Big R on a whim, a local farm store.  I'd been run ragged with the fall infestation of Wolf Spiders the size of ping-pong balls showing up in my living room.  These traps were a lifesaver and I'm 100% sure they've saved me the pending heart-attack all my arachnophobic anxiety attacks were leading up to.<br /><br />It doesn't matter where in the house I put them, up against a wall, in a corner, under the bed, under the tv cabinet...the spiders come, and they're trapped.  I don't understand that some of the other reviewers are having problems with larger bugs, because I'm not.  I'm catching wolf spiders and large beetles just fine, pretty much anything unwanted that gets into my house gets snagged, even a snake.  Yes, that's right, a snake got into my house and got his head stuck in the trap. (olive oil and some TLC set him free, don't worry.)<br /><br />Last week, I caught a Bombardier beetle, and I'm SO glad he got stuck in a trap before my dog found him.  They can shoot boiling chemicals at you, giving you burns! I've ordered more of these traps and keep them on hand, they're great.<br /><br />I'm giving these a 4 star rating because it would be better if the glue covered the entire bottom of the trap instead of a square in the center.

review/text: I was kindof hesitant when I set them up. I don't have too many bugs in my house but had noticed some surging in recently looking for water (record drought here).<br /><br />Immediately they didn't catch much. Almost nothing. But to my disbelief within about two months several scorpions had been caught in them. Scorpions! I'd never really had much of an issue with scorpions but apparently there are some in my home crawling around at night. We go barefoot 100% of the time indoors so this was a disturbing find. These little traps held the scorpions, as well as a number of other small spiders and little beetle like things, with ease.<br /><br />I keep a very clean (and very new - 3yrs old) house and was still impressed with what these traps caught. I recommend them.

review/text: We have a problem with centipedes and cave crickets in the basement.  I set these traps out for a few weeks, and they barely caught anything.  A couple tiny spiders and maybe one cave cricket.  I had much better success with the large flat glue boards.  The ones that look like mouse traps, but for insects.  The "pheromone" on these Victor traps does not seem to attract anything.  So I would recommend using the bigger flat boards.

I placed a trap in every corner of every room and hoped it would take care of my insect problem. It has been a week since the traps were placed and nothing has been caught. The pests that it was supposed to trap are actually crawling over it, under it, beside it, anywhere except in it. Needless to say this has been a major disappointment.

I managed to chase one directly into a trap and it took but 10 seconds to work its way right back out - and another one that I placed moved about 3 inches from where it was but had nothing in it.  These will probably work fine if your bugs are small but don't count on it to do anything with the big ones.

review/summary: It works if you place it well
review/text: Initially, I tried this product while experiencing an infestation of roaches in my kitchen & bathroom. Strangely, it caught just about every random bug *except* roaches.<br />Unlike the kitchen, I pretty much knew exactly what cracks the roaches were coming from in the bathroom because of seeing them so often at night during the infestation. After treating with other products (boric acid, abamectin, fipronil, gentrol), I decided to leave the traps there anyway, just in case. Each week after treatment I re-checked the traps, and there was never usually a roach. But since I didn't catch anything when I knew there were roaches, I wasn't sure if this was a sign of successful treatment or not.<br />Recently it's gotten warmer again, though I haven't seen any roaches around. I checked the traps again (months after my last check; I had no reason to as it seemed the roaches were gone). Each trap in the bathroom (4 total) had... a lot... of roaches in it. The kitchen traps still don't have anything, but I think it's really a matter of knowing where to put the traps. It's not good enough to place them where you happened to see a bug running by; it takes a bit of (unsettling) investigation to find the right spot. Once I did, they sure did work.<br />I only give this product 4/5, even though it has worked for me, because I am not really sure if it "attracts" roaches. Its pheromone attractant may be good for only a short period (the package doesn't say), or maybe a small radius around the trap. I say this because if it truly attracted roaches, I shouldn't have had to literally place these outside the roaches' nests. It seems like its success is based off of the roach happening to come across the trap rather than being drawn to it, like they are to other more toxic baits.<br />On the "poison free" aspect, I have not had a problem with having these around my cat & kittens. One kitten tried to play with a trap at one point, but hasn't touched it since because it's sticky. I'm always suspicious of these "non-toxic" type items since cats are generally sensitive to everything, but the stickiness of the trap itself seems to be a repellent to them, so that's good enough.

review/summary: Great for crickets, okay for spiders
review/text: I got these glue traps after finding a few big spiders and a silverfish in my basement. I was disappointed at first because they weren't catching anything, but when some crickets showed up they caught every last one of them. Since then they've occasionally caught a spider and they've never caught a silverfish - I don't think the bait attracts them. I'm giving them 5 stars for catching the crickets - if I had more spiders and silverfish I'd try another product.<br /><br />The traps come in a sealed package, with 6 two-trap pieces inside. You tear off a tab and *carefully* separate the two traps by tearing along the perforations. A trap is just a little box with an open side with glue inside on the bottom and some sort of bait inside on top. I put them in corners or under things, wherever I've seen bugs. They're all "active" once the package is open, so if I want to save some to use later I put them in a sealed bag or container.

I didn't think it'd be so effective against such large insects - especially the centipedes. However I was fairly impressed. Of course it worked pretty good on smaller various insects as well. I'm sure they didn't catch everything that went through them, but considering my main problem was house centipedes of which they caught several - I was very pleased. Pretty decent purchase for the price, great to use in combination with other insect control methods, but don't expect them to work a miracle by themselves..

review/summary: Seem pretty effective
review/text: Its hard to know just how effective roach traps are, but these seem pretty good.  First let me point out that if you have a serious roach problem, NO AMOUNT OF TRAPS WILL HELP.  You need an exterminator.  Traps like these only help determine if you have roaches (or other bugs) in your house *at all*, or they can help deal with SMALL roach problems.  During the summer months we occasionally see a roach so I got these to try to reduce how often that happened and it seemed to help, but not perfectly (we still see roaches, but hopefully less often than we would without the traps).  I placed ~6 around the house in different areas and 2 in the basement.  The 2 basement ones filled up with all kinds of bugs quite quickly (but no roaches).  After 3+ months, some of the house ones never caught anything while others did catch a roach or two.  Its worth noting that I also got a couple of Black Flag 61009 Roach Motels[...] and they never caught anything, so unless it was just odd luck, the Victor ones are probably better.

This device is wonderful for small insects but the big water bugs seem undeterred by walking through it.  However,  I did see some appendages left when throwing away a box.  I do like the device and have found the remains of many small insects with in the boxes.  I will buy more, but also continue to have the sonic bug repellant along side.

review/summary: Cricket Playground
review/text: Been having issues with crickets, I usually have one or two a week and I catch them in a bucket and toss them outside. With all the rain we've been having I'm seeing 3-5 a day. For the 3-5 I see, I worry about the ones I don't see and am worried that they're going to start multiplying in my house.<br /><br />To catch the explorers I bought these traps. Placed a few at the well known areas and they're working great. I really don't want to kill them but now it's to the point where I need to protect my property.<br /><br />Know that you really can't rely on one method for dealing with pests. I have purchased EcoPCO for around cracks of doors and windows and Ortho Home Defense MAX granules to sprinkle 2' away from my foundation.<br /><br />Yesterday was the first day I've come home and no little chirpers were waiting for me on the downstairs steps. I know I may have a straggler here or there but I am hopeful for the end to such an annoyance! Thanks Victor! Your sticky traps are exactly what I need for the critters that are already inside my home while I deal with securing my perimeter with harsher stuff.

review/summary: Capture Everything That Walks In
review/text: These traps are amazing, especially for spiders.  There isn't really anything else that effectively stops spiders poison wise,  but placing this in corners and near doors has allowed me to catch 100+ insects within a month.  I haven't noticed any increase in the amount of bugs getting in my house because of these, and have certianly noticed a lack of living ones (they die inside the traps).  The traps have caught tiny baby spiders to full grown adult cockroaches, and sadly, even a full grown gecko that got into my house near the door.

review/summary: Works great!
review/text: These traps work great and are non-toxic. We like them - even traps very small spiders and much larger insects that you wouldn't expect to "get stuck". A little patience and consideration of trap placement are important. Excellent and safe insect traps in our opinion!

review/summary: Roach Motel
review/text: Since I got the roach motel I notice a lot of these critters being trapped. Funny as it seems it catches ants and flies also. I am ordering another package since I am running out of traps. Don't use spray till I put the trap in the trash and then dose it with Raid to put any of the living roaches out of their misery.

review/summary: pill bug results
review/text: My review is for pill bugs (rolly pollies) only.  Our house had a lot of them.  I put out two 12-packs of the Insect Magnet traps.  It caught enough of them that I haven't seen any around for the last two weeks or so.

review/summary: Great product for roaches
review/text: It's such a great product and I'm going to buy more to trap all the roaches in my kitchen. It traps many roaches easily. When the adult roaches already caught on the trap produced large eggs that hatched to tiny little roaches, the little roaches got stuck to the trap again. Such an efficient trap! I usually "baked" the trapped animals over the oven to make sure they're all dead before I throw away the trap.<br /><br />However, the trap doesn't work that efficient on ants. So few ants got trapped. But somehow, the ants in my kitchen seem to have disappeared since I first placed traps. Maybe the ants are scared away by the traps? Not likely, but I haven't seen any more ants so far.

review/text: I put all 12 traps out on stove, kitchen counters and in kitchen cabinets and so far I have caught zero bugs!  But I have gone into the kitchen in the middle of the night and turned on the lights and saw them, so what am I doing wrong?????  It's been a week tomorrow since I put them out!

review/summary: Doesn't Work!
review/text: I followed the instructions exactly, and caught absolutely nothing. On the one hand, my house might be too clean for these to work. On the other, you'd think they would get at least one stray spider from time to time.<br /><br />Waste of money for sure!

review/summary: You won't believe what you'll catch!
review/text: I have been using this product for many years.  It is a great non-poisonous method of controlling the insect population in and around your house.<br /><br />I could not believe all that I caught.  Spiders, roaches, earwigs, a poor lizard, more spiders, more bugs...  Just put them in corners along the baseboard and check them periodically.  Mine filled up in no time with nasty critters.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this item if you are looking to catch bugs.
