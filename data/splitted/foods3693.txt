review/summary: EAT REAL PASTA AND RUN 5 MILES- MUCH LESS TORTURE THAN EATING THESE
review/text: I read about these forever on Hungry-Girl.com and I've always wanted to try them, they rave and rave and rave about them. She obviously gets a kick back from all of the products she markets on her site. I would be curious to see if SHE actually eats these. First of all I will say I can eat almost anything. I can fix taste and I eat diet food even if the taste is compromised, like fat free cheese.  The texture of these noodles weren't the worst part. Yes, they are slimy (almost like noodles that have been sitting in water way to long) because they come preserved in a fluid. So they are rubbery and slimy. Not the worst part though. The worst part is when you open the bag, it smells horribly of FISH- GROSS! I almost gagged. I rinsed them and cooked them in a pan with a little olive oil, cracked black pepper, fresh garlic to try and mask the smell, some parmesan cheese & tomatoes. From the first bite I expected it to taste like fish, but it wasn't a fishy taste. It tastes like you are eating noodles covered in soap. I know that sounds odd. It was NOT my dish, I have tried these a few times (fettuccine, spaghetti and other ones) and each and every time, strong fish smell, slimy noodles and soapy taste.<br /><br />NOT WORTH SAVING SOME CALORIES AND CARBS if you have to gag the food down. It would be less torture to go run 5 miles and just eat pasta.<br /><br />You will more than likely lose weight if you eat these, either from vomiting them back up or not being able to eat more than one bite. My appetite was ruined after I tried these. So if you are into some kind of ancient Chinese torture methods of eating then these may be for you.

review/summary: They're noodles...and tofu!
review/text: I first tried these tofu noodles on a whim.  They looked interesting, low-calorie, and fun to eat.  I am so happy I found these noodles!<br /><br />The noodles come in a pouch with water, and it is plenty for two people.  I drain out the water, add some fresh water, and microwave it in a bowl for 2 minutes.  They have a cool texture (like slippery ramen), and they have a very mild flavor.  I typically eat these noodles after adding some type of sauce and veggies.  Yummy!<br /><br />A warning:  when you first open the noodles, they smell strange.  VERY strange.  Almost so strange that you may not want to eat them!  Apparently this is normal (they are made with yam flour), and the package says to just boil them for 2 minutes to remove the smell.  After 2 minutes in the microwave, the smell really does go away!<br /><br />Overall, I love these noodles.  It is a low-cal, low-carb alternative to ramen noodles, and it has a lot of protein.  They are mild enough to mix with anything, and they are really easy to make.  Try it out and enjoy!

review/summary: A different kind of noodle
review/text: I bought a few bags of these noodles after reading a very favorable review of them on the Hungry Girl website, and I am glad that I did.  They work well in a number of different recipes, are filling, and add a "calcium boost" to the dishes I use them in, for very few calories.  These are not "pasta" type noodles, of course - the texture is different (softer and kind of "slippery"), and they have virtually no flavor of their own - they take on the flavor of whatever sauce or dressing you use with them.  I probably won't use these noodles with European-style or American-style sauces such as marinara or cheese sauce - those types of sauces were created for grain-based pastas, which these are not.  On the other hand, these noodles are fine in such Asian recipes as Pad Thai, Lo Mein and Dan-Dan Noodes (basically, noodles in a spicy peanut or sesame sauce).  There are a lot of Asian-style recipes in cookbooks and on the Internet which are fairly easy to make, taste terrific, and work beautifully with these noodles.  You can prepare yourself a real treat, if you use these noodles in the types of recipes that work well with their texture, and for a fraction of the calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice.  In short, if you attempt something like spaghetti with meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles, you're likely to be disappointed, but if you use them in Pad Thai, any type of curry, other Asian dishes, or most soups, you're likely to find yourself enjoying a delicious and wonderfully low-cal, low-carb meal.<br /><br />One thing - when you open the bag, there is a slight ammonia-like odor (it smells ammonia-like to me, anyway).  If you rinse the noodles well and then parboil them for a few minutes, as per the package directions, the odor really does disappear.  It is not a strong odor, it won't permeate your kitchen or anything like that, but you will definitely want to rinse and parboil the noodles before using them.  Just follow the package directions.

review/summary: traditional noodles
review/text: I spent some time in Japan and the shirataki noodles are used in a bunch of dishes including Sukiyaki.  Maybe that's why the Japanese are thin.  These noodles should be parboiled to remove the preservative.  They don't melt easily so they can be cooked for a long time.  They have a hard gelatinous texture so they don't absorb flavors easily.  I think they taste better with strong sauces, smoked meats, etc.  If you are trying to lower your carbs and/or cut calories, you can have your noodles and eat it too.

review/summary: BEST FOOD FIND EVER!!!!
review/text: Tofu Shirataki is simply amazing.  Anyone who says that it tastes or smells funny has not prepared it correctly.  To prepare:  drain and then rinse VERY well.  At this point, I prefer to cut the noodles up a bit.  Boil 2-3 minutes- any longer and the pasta will become tough.  Pat dry and add your favorite sauce.<br /><br />These taste just like pasta, but with SOOO many fewer calories.  This is not just a food for people 'trying to lose weight', as other reviewers have said.  This is a food for health-conscious consumers.  For me, this has been the find of a lifetime.  There are so many different recipes you can use them in, and they taste simply fantastic.  In fact, with sauce, they taste just like pasta (and who doesn't love pasta?).<br /><br />I learned about Tofu Shirataki through Hungry Girl.  On her web site, she has tons of low-calorie recipes using Tofu Shirataki [...]<br /><br />For anyone who has tried these and disliked them, please give them another try.  Make sure to drain and REALLY rinse the pasta before boiling.  The scent will vanish.  Cutting the pasta up helps as well, since it is slightly slippery.  Try it with a cheesy pasta bake, with your favorite marinara sauce, or even in soup!  The options are limitless.  This truly is a fantastic, fantastic product.

review/summary: Not as bad as the other reviews suggest
review/text: I ordered these noodles after reading about them on Hungry Girl.  Yes, they smell when you open them.  Just pour them into a strainer & rinse under warm water.  Then boil them for 2-5 minutes.  After that, I didn't think they smelled bad at all.  They do have a different texture, but I was able to chew them.<br /><br />If you are on a diet & tend to blow it over pasta, give these a try.  You can have a whole bag for minimal calories.  I added tomato sauce & parm. cheese.  While it's not an exact replacement for spaghetti, it does the trick if I want a big bowl of pasta.

review/summary: Most disgusting mistake of my life...
review/text: I tried these noodles after the numerous recommendations made by the website HungryGirl, but I must say that these noodles are the MOST disgusting thing I have ever eaten.  If you want to get these noodles, I highly suggest you get one pack to try before stocking up (as I did), because you will most likely be left with packs of noodles you won't want to eat.  These noodles have the most unbearable smell, and no amount of rinsing and microwaving I did could remove the horrendous stench.  Additionally, they were so oddly chewy and gelatinous that it is difficult to eat them.  You kind of have to knaw on them to get them to break off into bites.  The nutritionals are great, but they are so not worth any calories you save...they taste horrible and you'd wish you'd eaten nothing than waste 40 calories on these noodles!

Mmmm, so difficult to chew.<br /><br />Described as the perfect diet food for good reason. You won't be able to finish more than two forkfulls.

Also and excellent sub for pad thai dishes.  If the texture doesn't bother you, then go ahead and try it with your favorite western-style dishes.<br /><br />Shirataki (shredded konjac) really has no flavor itself, but like tofu, it absorbs flavors extremely well.  In addition to being low in calories and carbs, it's very good for your digestive system!  Eat up!

review/summary: Don't expect Italian pasta texture, but enjoy a new one.
review/text: It ain't spaghetti, folks, but used properly it can enhance your eating. It's great in a wet, soupy type dish. Eaten "as is" (after rinsing) the noodles are very soft and tender, too soft to pass for a dry Italian type pasta, unless you always cook dry pasta to death. Boiling them for a minute or two firms them up somewhat, but they never become as firm as a properly cooked dried pasta.<br /><br />For the reviewer who said that pasta is out due to his/her type 2 diabetes... it's not! I'm in the same boat, and we can still enjoy pasta, we just need to measure it to control the carb servings and always use whole grain types to slow down the sugar load. I weigh out 2 oz. before cooking for 2 carb exchanges (the 1/2 cup serving measurement is absurd because different types of pasta will fill a cup differently), and I use bulkier additions like chunky vegetables and have a big salad on the side.The oil and vinegar salad dressing helps to further temper the blood sugar rush. Of course, if you eat lots of carbs for breakfast and lunch, don't plan on 2 carb servings of pasta for dinner. And I have given up the (white) Italian bread on the side! That's the worst part, but the pasta is at least do-able.

review/text: My partner has to moniter blood sugar so we really don't get to eat a lot of pasta, bread, or starches like potato.  We found these at a local store and gave them a try.  They require attention to prepare: you have to drain, rinse, and parboil the noodles to remove the smell of the preservative, but once that is done these noodles are great.  I make them in thai noodle dishes and with some italian pasta sauces.  They are better with the thai dishes because they cook with the sauce a little more.<br /><br />Worth the effort especially if you have a limited diet because of sugar restrictions.

review/summary: Hypoglycemic dream food. . .
review/text: After reading some of the negative reviews for this product, I had to contribute my experience.  I am a hypoglycemic, which means that I have to severely restrict my consumption of breads, sugars, and carbohydrates including pastas and starches.  This week I was able to enjoy noodles again.  This product is fantastic.  I tried it in a Pad Thai dish and it perfectly resembled real noodles, in texture as well as flavor.  I have not tried it plain with a pasta sauce, for example, so I cannot vouch for how it tastes on its own.  It is VERY IMPORTANT, however, that when you prepare Shirataki you have to first strain the liquid from the bag out, soak in fresh water, then boil for two minutes.  After that you can add it to any dish you like! This eliminates any of the "chewy-ness" or gummi-ness that some other customers were complaining about.  All in all, the process does not take any longer than you would normally experience in boiling some raw pasta noodles...and if you ask me, it is well worth it.  Just to be able to enjoy eating noodles again without throwing my blood sugar off is a miracle!

I love this product.  The noodles are filling and are certainly NOT as bad as some of these reviews suggest.  I think that eating healthy is always a challenge.  This food does not taste gross.  Actually, there is not too much taste to it at all until you put a sauce on it (just like most Tofu products).  The texture is a little softer than most noodles but certainly far from GROSS.  We need to do what we need to do for health's sake!  Give em a try; I think you will be pleasantly surprised!!

review/summary: Fast, Tasty, but Not Cheap
review/text: As a Manhattanite, a vegetarian, and someone who takes food VERY seriously and is always on the lookout for quick, tasty, healthful meals, Asian cuisine of all stripes comprises a substantial percentage of my diet. I happened upon Amazon reviews of this product quite by accident, so sought it out when I was near a Gristedes, where I was directed to the produce section. Having read the reviews as well as being familiar with various Asian pastas, e.g., rice noodles, mung bean noodles, egg noodles, etc., I was neither put off nor surprised by descriptions of this product's texture/smell. I bought one each of this (which, surprisingly, I preferred) and the ramen-type and have tried both with Annie Chun's Thai Peanut Sauce (and now wish I'd had some chopped peanuts to add for texture).<br />Actually, the oft-cited aroma didn't hit me until the 2.5 minute parboiling recommended on the package and yes, it was rather peculiar. But it disappeared quickly and the noodles had no aroma or particular flavor afterward. I suggest draining them very well and blotting them with a paper towel so that they're more receptive to absorbing the sauce of your choice. I don't think they're a good choice as a vehicle for Western-type sauces--their texture is very Asian and is complemented by Asian sauces. But hey, that's just me; other people who've reviewed them enjoy them with Western dressings. They pick up the flavor of sauces quite well, have a negligible calorie count (40 for the whole package), are low in carbs, and actually contain a bit of protein. I have no reason to think they wouldn't work equally well in stir-fries and soups. My only complaint is that at two bucks a pop for an appetizer-sized portion, they're expensive--discovering that the nutritional analysis was based on a two-serving package earned a derisive snort from yours truly. I checked Koreatown (same price) and found them in Chinatown for $1.45--still not cheap, but definitely easier to justify at 25+% cheaper than two bucks.<br />Not for everyone, but really yummy for those who like Asian food or are receptive to trying something new. I think these are directed more towards the Japanese and Korean communities, but I gave them enough of a rave that the Chinese vendors who sold them to me seem inclined to give them a try themselves.

review/summary: The Shirataki Experiment
review/text: I've seen these around but all the negative press told me it wasn't worth the agony of trying to choke these stinky slimy suckers down. Anyway, practicing the reasonable-carb lifestyle, I rarely eat pasta but miss the convenience of pasta dishes for lunch.  Wondering if they were really *that* bad, I busted out the fiver I had burning a hole in my pocket and bought two bags. Ready for the most horrendous smell that had ever invaded human nostrils, I opened the bag and held my breath.  No sirens went off, the cats were still walking around and life appeared to go on, so I let my guard down and decided to take a breath while the noodles and I were in the same room.  Silly me, I thought to myself.  I've been fooled by the drama of Amazon reviewers.  Sure they do have a smell, but steaming up some brussels sprout will leave you worse off. A 30-second generous rinse of hot water in my favorite yellow Tupperware strainer yielded a healthy portion of stench-free noodles.  Then I decided to do what no man has dared to do before! I reach into the strainer with my index finger and opposable thumb, pinched a tablespoon-sized serving of plain hot rinsed noodles, and stuck them directly in my mouth! O.M.G.... nothing happened.  So I made my spaghetti and had a great day.

review/summary: Finally, a GREAT substitute for noodles and pasta! And here's the calorie info...
review/text: I agree with the reviewer who gave these a stellar rating. We've tried a variety of pasta and noodle alternatives (spaghetti squash etc) and the results ranged from interesting to...terrible. The spaghetti squash was the best alternative but it certainly didn't taste like regular pasta. But regular pasta plays havoc with our blood sugar and whole wheat pasta wasn't to our liking...so we continued our search.<br /><br />These Tofu Shirataki Fettucini are the absolute alternative to pasta which we've found and they are very tasty. I noticed that one person here said they were "tough" and "inedible". NOT TRUE. Also, they have only 40 calories per package and one package was certainly enough to be a generous serving for me (it might take two packages for someone with a hefty appetite). I tested my blood sugar before and after eating these, both within an hour of eating them and several hours later. My blood sugar stayed nice and level, so there was that benefit as well.<br /><br /> As far as texture goes, they ARE closer to an "al dente" (a bit chewy) pasta than an overcooked, mushy pasta but we'd always preferred our pasta a bit on the "al dente" side. If you don't like "chewy" you might not like the Tofu Pasta. That didn't bother us one bit.<br /><br />True, the taste is not identical to pasta but we both felt that (like most tofu) it picked up the taste of whatever we put on it and any remaining taste was subtle, in our opinion.<br /><br /> The first time we ate it we put on homemade tomato sauce, fresh Parmesan and oregano and basil (fresh basil) It was yummy! The second time we made spaghetti (canned sauce and ground beef and freshly chopped spices) and it was also delicious. I then experimented with various sauces, from those with a sour cream base to creamed cottage cheese and a bit of butter and green onions. Every time, the result was delicious - and what a calorie savings over regular pasta.<br /><br />  We have not eaten them plain or buttered, like regular noodles or pasta. I have a feeling the texture might be more noticable then and there might be a subtle taste that would be different from pasta.<br /><br />  This is as detailed and clear as I can be. We were absolutely DELIGHTED to discover and use these and found them to be the best substitute by far for our favorite pasta (although we're certainly open to suggestions for others).<br /><br />PS: Since writing my original review, I wanted to note that I adapted a sweet noodle kugel recipe using these as the "noodles". It was delicious. For anyone who might be interested in doing the same, I did NOT bake the kugel like you do a traditional one. I simply used Light Sour cream, cinnamon and Splenda to make a kugel that would work for diabetics or those on a diet. I did heat the noodles in the microwave after draining them because they do tend to leak liquid even when they are heated up without any. I added the other ingredients to the hot noodles and heated gently on the stovetop. Leftovers were eaten cold.

review/text: I read about this product on the Hungry Girl website.  It listed Amazon as a supplier.  I read all the reviews and decided to place an order.  It took longer than I expected to arrive, since I had to pay extra shipping I thought it would be here sooner.  The extra shipping must have been  for the cool pack in the box it was shipped in.<br /><br />The noodles were a little chewier than regular pasta.  But like regular pasta the didn't really have a taste of their own and took on the taste of what ever sauce you use.  I really did like them.  Being diabetic, it is a great pasta alternative that will not raise my blood sugar.  And I didn't find a unpleasant smell when I opened the bag as another reviewer wrote. Just the same I did rinse them well.<br /><br />I have since found them in a local health food store so I won't have to pay the high shipping any more.  I have not been able to find the spaghetti type anywhere, only the flat noodle type and I would really like to try the spaghetti.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to any one that wants a lower carb, lower calorie pasta.

However, a local grocer recently started stocking them so I couldn't resist paying the few dollars for a package.<br /><br />I was shocked - no smell but I boiled them up to warm them up anyways. They went great with a simple tomato sauce and grated cheese. You get a good size bowl of mild flavored noodles that may be slighty more slippery than regular pasta, but nothing that bother my tastes. For 40 calories its a good thing to add to dishes when you need to eat light - soups would be really ideal with this type of noodle.

review/summary: No noodle in Asia tastes like this!
review/text: I, too, have eaten noodles in Japan, China and South east Asia. In fact noodles are one of my favorite foods. Amazingly I have never tasted anything as foul as these. Rubberey and disgusting. I parboiled them, stirfried them, microwaved them; tried every way to cook them to eliminate the awful flavor. Others have said they like them, I suggest you try one package to make your decision. I think this is a food that requires a less sensitive taste mechanism to eat.

review/summary: Shirataki Oodles Of Noodles, Tofu-Styled
review/text: I expect 2006 to be a breakout year for shirataki noodles because people want to eat heathier and better by choosing foods that help them cut down on the carbs without sacrificing the taste and texture they adore. It's a delicate balance, but shirataki noodles are proving it can be done.<br /><br />I've already tried the Konjac brand of shirataki noodles and reviewed them for you last week. Now let me introduce you to another kind of shirataki noodles that are quite different from the Konjac brand. They're from a company called House Foods.<br /><br />House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are a unique combination of tofu and polysaccharide glucomannan (yam flour) to provide a genuinely authentic pasta texture that you frankly just don't get from the Konjac brand. I was extremely surprised by the House Foods brand and would definitely choose this brand over Konjac in a side-by-side comparison -- DEFINITELY!<br /><br />What's so different about the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles?<br /><br />For starters, each 4-ounce serving (2 servings per bag) has just 20 calories and a neglible 1g net carbs (3g total carbs minus 2g of dietary fiber). While that's not ZERO, it's certainly not bad, especially considering the trade-off you make in the texture of these noodles. These are perfect for every phase of livin' la vida low-carb for a nutritious and delicious pasta alternative.<br /><br />Also, they are sugar-free, gluten-free, cholesterol-free, dairy-free, and even have 10% calcium. What could be better?<br /><br />When I opened my bag of Noodle Shaped House Foods Tofu Shirataki for supper tonight, I immediately smelled the infamous fishy odor from them as I have come to expect from this product. But don't let that deter you away from enjoying the final version of this product, though, because the smell does go away quickly once you have rinsed them off and warmed them up for a few minutes either in boiling water or in the microwave.<br /><br />After draining the noodles in a collander, I transferred them to a bowl, sprinkled some garlic Alsosalt on them, and poured my favorite no sugar added spaghetti sauce on top. Mixing the noodles together with the sauce, I warmed it up in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Then I added some pepperoni slices and mozarella cheese on top and cooked it in the microwave for an additional minute. Mmmmmm. This looks so good!<br /><br />Voila! My low-carb House Foods Tofu Shirataki pasta dish was complete and it was time to eat.<br /><br />Since I had already tried another brand of shirataki noodles previously, I was expecting them to be similar when I put them in my mouth. But imagine my surprise when I started chewing and noticed they were soft like real pasta and weren't as "chewy" as the other brands. WOW! Check it out, this is AWESOME dude! Can you imagine shirataki noodles getting any better than this? My wife said they reminded her of Oodles of Noodles when she looked at them.<br /><br />House Foods has certainly found their niche in the shirataki noodles market and I applaud them for providing consumers with a unique choice. While the other brands of shirataki noodles certainly aren't bad products, the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are the only ones on the market today that provide the actual look and feel of real pasta without the carbs or calories! CONGRATULATIONS to them for doing such an excellent job with their products!<br /><br />And apparently the consumer seems to like House Foods Tofu Shirataki, too, because their Fettuccini Shaped and Noodle Shaped products are currently #1 and #2 respectively on the list of bestselling Gourmet Foods at Amazon.com. How about that?<br /><br />So go ahead, give 'em a try! All you have to lose is excess weight. Eating pasta on a "diet" never tasted so good, baby!<br /><br />We haven't heard the last of shirataki!

review/summary: Tofu Shirataki Noodles....THUMBS UP!
review/text: After reading many of the reviews for the Tofu Shirataki noodles, I was skeptical of trying them. But, I was able to find them at the local Shoppers Market and decided to try a bag. I expected the cost to be high, but was pleasantly surprised that they were only a dollar a bag on sale! I bought a bag of the spaghetti shaped noodles since they were out of the fettucini. I then bought a jar of low fat Ragu Alfredo Sauce. This sauce has a lot lower carbs than the tomato based sauces so that is why I decided to use it.<br /><br />As far as the preparation, I put a pot of water on the stove and began to boil it. When I opened the bag of Tofu Shirataki noodles, I expected a strong "fishy" smell. Believe me, the smell is very slight and not at all anything to be grossed out about. I then rinsed the noodles in a colander with hot water for a few minutes. I then put the noodles in the pot of boiling water and boiled them for about 2 to 3 minutes. When I drained them in the colander, there was NO SMELL at all. To be honest, there wasn't a smell after I just rinsed them thoroughly, but I boiled them anyway. After rinsing again in hot water I then used paper towel and DRIED THE NOODLES very thoroughly. The noodles are a little long, so I cut them with a pair of kitchen scissors.<br /><br />I prepared a serving of Ragu Alfredo sauce and then poured it over the noodles. At this point, nothing was different than if I used regular spaghetti. The Tofu Shirataki absorbed the alfredo sauce very nicely and it looked rather appetizing. Now for the taste test. When I put the noodles in my mouth, they were no different than regular spaghetti. It is when I bit down on the noodle that I noticed the difference. The texture is firmer and a little bit chewy, but not like a "rubber band" like some of the reviews stated. That was the biggest difference in these noodles. However, it just took a little bit of time to get used to the texture. After a few mouthfuls it didn't bother me at all, and I was surprised how great it tasted and how well the sauce was absorbed by the noodle.<br /><br />The bottom line is....I LOVE the Tofu Shirataki noodles and will definitely buy them again! Now, I am glad that I bought the spaghetti shape noodles because I think that the fettucini noodles would be much more "chewy" because of the size of the noodles. So for now, I will stick with the spaghetti version. Gice them a try and ENJOY!

review/text: Quick rinse and eat like ramen.  I personally cooked it up for 10 mins in flavored broth, added my veggies and meats and it is exactly like ramen.  The only difference is, you don't digest it, it just comes out looking exactly the same as it looked coming in meaning, no digestion! Chaching!  Weight loss! The other brands are more rubbery, this one really has the exact texture of ramen, just don't let other bad reviews mess with your head, it's really not bad at all.

review/summary: Best used in Asian foods
review/text: I buy these at Whole Foods, where a pack retails for $1.49. I prefer the "spaghetti-style" over the fettucine variety, since it's more like ramen.<br /><br />If you're used to Asian noodles, then you'll probably have no issue with the flavor. The texture is a little chewier than traditional noodles, and it's simply not the same as egg-based pasta. If you rinse these first and then put them into a skilllet and lightly fry/steam them for a few minutes until they get hot it both improves the texture and removes the residual flavor.<br /><br />I eat tofu shirataki primarily as a ramen replacement. I have had a ramen habit since college but let's face it, they're empty calories. I have half a bag virtually every workday with instant miso soup doctored up with green onions and some garlic-chili sauce. It's a filling, healthy and guilt-free lunch or afternoon snack that's around a buck a serving that's 55 calories. With a couple ounces of chicken, it's around 100 calories.<br /><br />1 serving of these noodles has 20 calories/2 grams of fiber. Regular ramen has 280 calories per serving (half a package) and no fiber. So, just by substituting these noodles, I've probably cut 1000+ calories a week from my diet.<br /><br />We sometimes add the fettucine variety to stir-fries and Thai-style or Indian-style curries with good results since they just take on whatever flavor you put them in. It's a great fridge staple.<br /><br />But again -- I'd really only use it for Asian dishes. I would not recommend them for use in standard western preparations, such as tomato sauce or alfredo. There are other GF options out there for egg-based noodles that I think work better.<br /><br />I prefer these to the "Miracle Noodles" -- the tofu added into these noodles definitely makes the texture and flavor better. You can find these at Whole Foods and at some Safeway and Trader Joe's stores (they're usually in the refrigerated section near tofu.) The shipping is kind of high because they're packed in water, which is heavy.

review/summary: Shirataki noodles
review/text: I followed all directions on preparing the noodles and am pleased to say that they were not at all tough or rubbery.  The fettuccini resembled the texture of fine pad thai noodles and the noodles were something like the cup-a-soup noodles.  Mind you it is flavorless and not a gourmet item, but with its low low calorie and carb count, it is not at all bad.  Just be mindful of the sauce used. I mixed it with frozen vegetables in a low-fat sauce and added grated cheese, and it was light and pleasant.  I look forward to experimenting with other additions.

review/summary: Awesome Pasta Swap
review/text: I heard about these as many others have from the Hungry Girl books, website, and show.  I finally decided to jump in with both feet and placed and pretty substantial order for the spaghetti and angel hair.  I was so excited when they arrived since I am a pasta freak and couldn't wait to see if these were really a good reduced calorie swap.  Due to the Hungry Girl show I was fully prepared for the smell when I opened them and although it is definitely not pleasant it isn't as awful as others make it sound.  It is not ammonia or some other unbearable stench.  My husband pegged it when he said it smells like fish.  I rinsed them thoroughly for 2 minutes and then dried them completely with paper towels.  I microwaved them for a minute and then added my favorite pasta sauce.  Now I will say the texture is not exactly the same as regular pasta but it is so very close; they are much closer than the whole wheat pasta I had switched to.  They are a little chewier but it is really very minimal.  So honestly if you can deal with the smell of fish I highly recommend these noodles if you are looking for a great low calorie swap for pasta!!

review/summary: Give the noodles a chance!
review/text: I picked up two bags of these from the refrigerated section at Whole Foods. Based on the reviews I'd read, I wanted to minimize my losses if I discovered I hated them.<br /><br />Most people reported they weren't good with marinara sauce, so I decided to try them for the first time in a stir fry dish.<br /><br />The amount of pasta in the fluid-filled bag looked really small, but it claimed to contain two servings. I was prepared for the "fishy" smell when I cut the bag open, so it didn't gross me out. I kept reminding myself "I like fish!" and I was fine. I followed the directions to rinse and drain the noodles thoroughly, then there was a choice to make: you could either parboil them for a couple minutes or microwave them for one minute. The microwave method sounded quicker and easier, so I popped them in. After that, the directions said to "dry" the noodles. I didn't like the idea of spreading the noodles out on paper towels, so I used a method I read about on the internet--I pan fried them in a nonstick skillet until they were dry. While they were frying, I used the edge of the spatula to cut them into manageable-sized pieces.<br /><br />I added them to the stir fry just before pouring in the sauce, heated through, and hesitantly tasted the result. It was good! I mopped up a plateful and wished I could go back for seconds. There were plenty of noodles for two, if you're not ravenous. I found them very filling--which is all to the good if you're dieting, right?<br /><br />I can imagine adding these to a bowl of beef broth for a filling lunch and practically no damage to my daily calorie "budget." I might even try them with regular pasta sauce, despite the poor reviews, since I think the pan frying may have improved their texture enough to sub them for real pasta. Then again, I occasionally sub spaghetti squash for pasta, so maybe my pasta standards are unusually low.<br /><br />Bottom line, I will definitely buy more of these!

I rinsed them off and tasted one...not much flavor which is par for the course with pasta anyway.  These are much healthier and lighter.  I put the noodles in a pot of "No-Chicken broth (veggie but chix flavored), a bag of veggies (fiesta blend), onion, and chix strips. Made a great low cal lunch soup.  Yay!

review/summary: Much better then the plain Shirataki Noodles
review/text: I love the Tofu/Shirataki combination...it's not as chewy as the plain shirataki noodles, therefore much easier to eat.  I was surprised at all the negative reviews, but as they say..."to each their own". I purchase mine from my local Asian Market which saves me $1.25 per bag...awesome! After a good rinse & parboiling for about 5 minutes, I then drain it well before adding it to the dish that I'm preparing...no funny smell at all! The noodles itself doesn't really have any taste but it fills me up, saves me a ton in unwanted calories & carbohydrates, and it give me a feeling of satiation. In my opinion, these noodles are a wonderful alternative to starchy pasta. Great for those who are on the Atkin's Diet.

review/text: They are o.k. if you rinse them really really well.  The smell is off putting but they are o.k. if you are doing hard core dieting or off of carbs.  I have since decided that real pasta (wheat, or w/ fiber, or protein) is a better substitute.  The Shirataki noodles are extremely rubbery and make it  difficult to chew but the noodles themselves don't have a flavor. I now see them in my local grocery store, but still never  buy them.

review/summary: Shirataki Taste and Prep Test
review/text: I bought fresh noodles. The package temperature went up maybe 10 degrees before I got home.<br />1. Opened the package, there was a mild fishy smell. If your noodles smell like ammonia, send them back. My food chemistry experience suggests that the ammonia smell means spoilage. If you boil some potatoes and leave them uncovered in the refrigerator for around two weeks, they will smell of ammonia.<br />2. Washed and drained the noodles in filtered water. After two rinsings the smell was reduced.<br />3. Cooked one noodle in hot oil - slippery/rubbery texture even after 3 minutes. Slightly bitter, otherwise tasteless.<br />4. Stir fried noodles in oil, added pad thai sauce (hot sauce, fish sauce and vinegar). Still slippery. Left some noodles cooking too long and they began to pop. The popped noodles were like rubber!<br />5. Added onions cooked until done but still crunchy - delicious!<br />6. I ate a large salad and then one serving of the noodles. I felt full after eating the noodles.<br />Lessons: buy fresh, rinse well, don't over or under cook, add something to offset the flavor and texture.<br />I will eat these again and I'll update if I find a good recipe.

I also have made them with cream of mushroom soup and a little tuna, as well as a pesto sauce. On to a Chinese type dish next. Hungry-Girl rocks!

review/text: I have just recently tried this type of noodle and thought they were a great replacement for regular noodles especially if you want low cal, etc or can't eat regular noodles.  I am not sure what people are talking about when they refer to the smell because I didn't notice any smell at all.  They do have a slightly different texture but I did not find them rubbery at all.  They take on the flavor or whatever you are putting them in; they really don't have much flavor of their own.  But everyone's taste is different so it would be a good idea to try this type of noodle first.  No matter what kind you get - spaghetti, fettuccine, or angel hair - they are all the same, just wider or thinner.

Then to pay that much to find out it has taken nearly a month to receive the product is ridiculous.  I placed my order on 1-21 and after several e-mails, follow up promises of shipment last week, today on 2-15 I finally recieved notice it would be shipped.  This company wont receive my business again.

review/text: I don't understand all the hype on this product.  I bought 6 bags and prepared one for my husband and I for dinner with shrimp.  Followed the directions to rinse well. The noodles were chewy and the texture unappetizing.  My husband hardly ate any and went without dinner.  Maybe I was hoping what they promised was true, but I wouldn't recommend these to anyone who enjoys food.

review/summary: Give these a Try!
review/text: These are definately worth trying!  No, it is not EXACTLY like real pasta.  The slightly fishy smell (like miso soup/japanese food/seafood)goes away after rinsing.  The texture is slippery and unique--its not bad but you probably won't want to eat these plain.<br /><br />First drain the noodles, put them in a bowl of fresh water and microwave them for 1-2 minutes.  Drain the water and pat try, then add your sauce and heat a little bit more until warm.  If you are following the Hungry Girl recipe, add slightly more parmesan cheese and "the laughing cow" soft cheese (I love the french onion flavor).  Season with salt, pepper, garlic salt, and cayenne pepper.  It is absolutely declicious and only 100 calories for a big bowl of noodles!

review/text: I just bought this at the store to try it out. I rinsed them for about 3 minutes to get the slight funk off, stir fried them with a little teriyaki and soy sauce (low sodium both) and veggies.<br />It was extremely tasty and very filling! Texture is like a cross between a Ramen noodle and a glass noodle. I'm stuffed and I ate about 100 calories for the whole thing.<br />I have bypassed pasta for years just due to the calorie and carb count, and I am delighted with this product. I can't wait to buy more and try out new recipes.

review/summary: Not exactly spaghetti but great for what it is!
review/text: I tried these noodles for the first time today.  I made a nice Chinese Brown Sauce with some chicken, cabbage and onion and added the noodles.  I really liked them.  I am following a low calory diet and it is nice to find a low calory substiture for spaghetti.  For me spaghetti is more or less just a carrier for a flavorful sauce (which I can make low calory fairly easily).  So these noodles work well in that capacity.  But if you are looking for a substitute that will give you that starchy taste of spaghetti this isn't it.  It's going to be impossible to get an exact match for spaghetti with so few calories.<br /><br />There are several comments that the Shirataki noodles smell fishy.  That smell is VERY faint just out of the bag.  I rinsed them several times and it went away.  I also spread them on a cookie sheet and dried them in the oven a bit (on the advise offered in one of the earlier reviews).<br /><br />The noodles don't have any flavor on their own.  And they have a slightly chewy, rubbery texture which I actually enjoyed.  They are tender but chewy.  Obviously some folks found that very off-putting.  To each his own.  I don't like sweet potatos.<br /><br />If you are looking for a low calory substitute for spaghetti or other noodles, give this a try.  They aren't expensive so you won't be out much if you don't find them to your taste.  And you just might find they work for you and help you stay on your diet.<br /><br />I am definitely going to use them.  I am going to try them with a red spaghetti meat sauce next.

review/text: Heard these noodles mentioned on Dr. Oz and had to try them. Have to say I'm impressed! Yes, there is a slight odor when you open the bag, but it's no big deal if you're expecting it and know it's "normal." It rinses away. The texture is different from regular noodles, but not as dramatically so as I'd been led to believe reading some of the reviews. With the sauce, it tasted like spaghetti to me. And very filling! I had 2 servings (one bag) several hours ago and am still feeling full -- not bad for a meal of around 220 calories (including the sauce and parmesan cheese I put on it).

There are so many ways to use them.  Sometimes I just put a little chicken broth in a pot with the noodles and some seasonings and boil for a couple of minutes and I have wonderful chicken noodle soup without all the carbs and cals of regular chicken noodle soup. Thanks for the great product.

review/text: These noodles are truly a miracle for the low carb/diabetic/gluten intolerant.  I found these in my local grocery store in the health-food/soy cheese section.  I decided to try them because of the hungry-girl logo on the front.  They do smell truly horrific when you open them, but a quick rinse in boiling water and the smell really disappeared. Some commenters have noted that they have a slightly different or more rubbery texture than pasta, but I used them with my grandma's very thick "ratatouille" spaghetti sauce and a little parmesan cheese and they were amazing.  Also, you can have seconds without fear- only 20 calories and 1 net carb per serving.  Hallelujah!

review/summary: Texture
review/text: Bottom line. The texture is kind of like eating squid. I like squid and especially its texture. Also, that "fish" smell doesn't bother me and I didn't even notice it after I rinsed it. I cooked these noodles like an Asian stir fry, I wouldn't recommend the Italian route and trying to make Alfredo or spaghetti.<br /><br />I know a lot of people who would say this was "yucky", but I'm a seafood lover who likes that elastic texture. Not for everyone, but I don't see how it is that bad either...especially with so few calories and carbs. But again, I think if you steer clear of trying to turn it into an Italian type dish and stick to more stir fry or soup, this is an excellent choice.

review/text: I purchased 3 types of these noodles at my regular grocery store in the refrigerated area where tofu is sold. The package says "Keep Refrigerated", so it is a little puzzling that these can be sold and then shipped with no refrigeration.  The cost per 2-serving bag was $1.99, and there were two modest portions in the bag.  Upon opening the bag, I smelled a rather strong, somewhat fishy order.  I immediately strained and rinsed the noodles, then I placed them in a pan with some expeller-pressed peanut oil and warmed them (they didn't brown). I decided to add some canned bean sprouts (1/2 large can, drained), Guilin hot chili sauce, water, garlic powder, and coconut sap sugar (3 - 4 tsp.)<br />It tasted pretty good.

The only different I could tell was that they were chewy compare to a regular noodle. I rinse them off, boiled them in water for 2-3 minutes, rinse them again, and let them stand for as long as it took to heat up a small saucepan of Ragu sauce.<br /><br />I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 just because of the chewy nature of them.

review/summary: THESE NOODLES ARE FANTASTIC!!!!
review/text: I read all the good and bad reviews and I tried these noodles anyway.  The Shirataki noodles are not like your standard noodles and they have to be rinsed twice and I microwave them for 2.5 to 3 minutes and they turn out fine.  Let them drain for about 15-30 minutes after putting them in the microwave.  I'm on Weight Watchers and love soups in the winter and these work perfectly.  I was a little skeptical because I had to purchase 10 bags at one time but I have let my friends and Weight Watchers classmates try these and they are wonderful.  Yes, they have a fishy smell but with the proper care you don't smell them.  Yes, they are a little rubbery and taste a little different than your average noodles, but remember they are from the Japanese yam family.  You have to give a little to get a little and these work great.  Try them you won't be sorry!!!!

Did you let them sit out on your front porch for a week??If you FOLLOW THE PREP DIRECTIONS (rinse well, parboil (NOT RECOOK!! THEY ARE COOKED ALREADY!)in a large amount of water), the are a nice, filling macaroni substitute.  They are rather bland, but so is white durum wheat macaroni--what did you expect? Top w/ tomato sauce and boca italian sausage, great vegetarian spaghetti supper. My only complaint was the delay (due to v.high demand per Gristedes)in the shipping and then my first UPS shipment was lost. But Gristedes sent a replacement package and refunded part of the shipping, which was the right thing to do, so I'll shop w/them again.

review/text: I just finished having pancakes made fro this mix. It was a free sample given at a gluten-free food fair. If you are the kind of person who misses hearty, whole-grain style pancakes because of having to eat gluten free, these are for you. The flavor was hearty, but not overwhelming and the texture was surprisingly light.<br /><br />Nutritionally, they are quite on the plus side. No nutritionally deficient white rice or other filler flours. All the ingredients are organic if that makes a difference to you. And they are Weight Watcher friendly. Only two points per two pancakes, and six grams of fiber. This mix is definitely going to be a staple in my cupboard!<br /><br />If you are new to gluten free products, buckwheat flour is not related to wheat but to rhubarb and is a safe flour unless it is mixed with wheat flour as so many buckwheat pancake mixes are. This mix is definitely safe for the GF diet.<br /><br />If you are concerned about whether it can be prepared casein free, the directions state you can use almond, rice or soy milk.

I've tried a variety of gluten-free products and mixes and believe I have now found a company that makes some of the best-tasting products out there.<br />We'll definitely be buying more as we are all looking forward to trying the cookies and the other pancake mix.

review/text: Ever since Aunt Jemima discontinued their buckwheat pancake mix I have been searching for an acceptable replacement.  This is it!  This tastes as good as AJ's and its gluten free to boot.  It's a little pricey but if you love buckwheats, try this one, it's the best I've found.

review/summary: Good cat food company but....
review/text: My cats like this food and it is truly grain free. However, I think the cans actually contain more calories - especially the Lamb and Venison formulas - than the website states they do. I am very careful about what I feed my indoor cats and don't give them dry food or treats, so I know exactly what they are eating. Whenever I use these 2 formulas they gain weight rapidly. They like it - it has less liquid than other canned foods, so the meat is packed in very dense. I usually add some water and mash it up before feeding. If you cat needs to add a pound or two - this is your food!

review/summary: Cat food a dog wouldn't eat
review/text: I don't know how ANYONE could rate this so-called "cat" food above a 1 star - it is CRUD.<br /><br />The food is cheap - stuffed full of fillers. My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk. It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well, it's not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick - one of the major ingredients in ALL their "flavors" is Montmorillonite CLAY (yes, the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud!) - ie, very similar to what cat litter is made from...<br /><br />To show how bad it is, even the raccoons and coyotes won't eat this junk - they'd rather eat carrion...<br /><br />Those that think this is "good" food, I can't imagine the crud you've been feeding your cats before - shame on you! Shame on anyone buying this crud - go buy a selection of Fancy Feast (Classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats - and it's excellent quality food - puts this junk to shame) and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk.<br /><br />I wish I could give this crud negative stars - it shouldn't be allowed to be sold.

review/summary: Gorgeous finishing salt
review/text: I have a small collection of finishing salts that I use for different things. This one is my favorite for things like salad and desserts. It's gorgeous with large crystal shapes that are very thin, some are just flakes, but other pieces are like shallow hollow pyramids. The flavor is mild and they have a nice snap which adds a textural interest to chocolates and candies.<br /><br />For more robust flavors, I prefer stronger flavored salts like smoked or Peruvian pink salts.

I broght one 32oz with two tablets and one 32oz without.  I found that I could tolerate the flavored water.  As for the electrolyte helping with chemical balance, I can't be 100% certain.  I did not collaps in heat but it could just be that I was not pushing my body over the limit.<br /><br />REI sells this same stuff for $6.95 a tube.

You want a date that is a little less sweet for health reasons<br />  or matter of taste<br />3. You are Muslim and want to eat the exact type of dates that are recomended<br />  by the Muslim Prophet Muhamed.<br /><br />Although I had basic flat rate shipping these were sent to me priority and I had them in 2 days. I was really shocked how fast they came. I will order again next year if they are still here and the price does not go up .

review/summary: good dark smoky French Roast flavor for price.
review/text: I am normally a Starbucks French Roast drinker, but as the price is up to and over $1 per oz, I was looking for a substitute. It is slightly less rich in flavor as SBucks, if I could give it a 4.5 stars, that might be fitting. However, for the value for the 2 lb bag, it is far worth the small difference in taste.

review/summary: Low fat doesn't mean precarious.....
review/text: I remember that these bad boys saved my life at a job I use to have.  I would throw a couple of these Pop Tarts in the toaster and enjoy with a cup of coffee.  I must say that they held me over very well until lunch time.<br /><br />Or under the assumption I didn't have time for lunch because my former job was known for not letting an easy going guy like myself have the ability to go to lunch, despite my high production and charismatic personality.  I guess that is why I don't work there anymore.<br /><br />I digress, these Pop Tarts are really good and they don't taste low fat at all.  The bold flavor of brown sugar and cinnamon burst from these Pop Tarts like a banshee's guffaws after Halloween is over.  This treat is an exquisite pastry the can be served like beignets in The French Quarter.<br /><br />I will stop with the metaphors this really is a great product.

review/summary: If not for Kellogg's warning label I might have blown up the house
review/text: I stummbled down the stairs in the morning, desperately in need of norishment to start my day. As I head toward the kitchen I am overwhelmed with a craving for Kellogg's Pop-Tarts. The low-fat frosted brown sugar cinnamon variety is the flavor that has stolen my heart. Not only is the kind contain the lowest amounts of sugar per serving in comparison to its sibling flavors in the Pop-Tart family, they are also comfort food that brings back many childhood memories. I grabbed a pouch out of the 14.7-ounce, 8 count box. Oh no! This is the only one left in the box. Thank goodness I have 9 more boxes on the shelf. I was in a hurry to get to my morning class amd found there was not enough time to wait for the toaster to perfectly brown and warm my duo of tarts. Because the microwave's superior cooking technology, I assume this appliance will warm my Pop-Tarts in the time alloted. I was just preparing to place them inside (as is) and cook them for 30 seconds when my roommate came into the kitchen and addressed the situation. She pushed me out of the way and grabbed my breakfast, still in its foil wrapper, out of the microwave. "Read the warning label," she said. The foil pouch says in blue lettering "do not microwave in pouch." She informed me foil in a microwave can catch on fire. If not for her or Kellogg's warning label I could have burnt the kitchen.

review/summary: A Catch-22 product
review/text: It seems that with these types of protein shakes, there isn't much of a happy medium.  You can either have something that is very high in protein and tastes terrible, or one that is lower in nutritional value, tastes great and has too high a sugar content.  This one falls in the 2nd of those two categories.  I thought the taste of this shake was exceptional, but as others have pointed out, it's quite high in sugar, and at only 20 grams of protein as opposed to other brands with 40 or 50, there are many products out there that would be more beneficial and provide a higher protein content.

review/text: I generally make my own shakes from Whey Protein powder and add either yogurt (Yoplait vanilla is a favorite) or bananas, then blend it with a hand blender. The pre-mixed protein shakes I have tried are generally not as good. After trying this recovery shake though, containing both casein and whey proteins, I would have to say that it was actually pretty good. It was a little high in carbs (44gr) but I've never been one to worry about those.<br /> A good protein shake overall.
