review/text: If your kids like gummies, these are a better choice. They don't taste too "healthy" so your kids will like them. They're not too sugary, and have 100% vit c in them and I like to suport Annie's; they're better than the alternative gummies at the store.

review/summary: Wonderful product.
review/text: This is a great product. This fruit snack doesn't include a lot of the "not-so-good-for-you" ingredients that other fruit snack contain, like high fructose corn syrup and fake food dyes. And the exciting thing is it is ORGANIC!<br />My toddler loves these snacks. They are a bit softer and chewier then other conventional fruit snacks, but they taste great. I would recommend this to anyone trying to move away from all the fake additives in other products marketed towards children.

review/text: These are very sweet and yummy gummies.  And even tho there is cane juice in them they far surpass the store bought corn syrup, sugary kind.  My kids really love them although we still use them as a "treat" and not a "snack" even though they are supposed to be more healthy which they are but its not like an orange or apple if you catch my drift.

review/text: We had high hopes for this since we love Annie's crackers and pasta.  Alas, these snacks are a horrible healthy replacement for gummies.  They may be healthy for you, but if your kids aren't going to eat them (all the grown-ups whom we've had try them dislike them as well) it doesn't really do much good.  Too bad, we really wanted to like these things.

review/summary: Product tastes of artificial flavoring and sticks to the teeth
review/text: I'm rather upset about the product because it is advertised as a natural product, everything's organic, so I don't expect artificial flavoring.  Yet, immediately upon tasting it, I detected artificial flavoring.  It doesn't taste natural at all.  Further, it sticks to the teeth, and isn't chewy.  To be certain I wasn't being unfair, I made myself eat the whole package just to be sure, but my opinion stays the same after a whole package of it.  Very disappointed.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: The store where I usually get Fever Tree Ginger Beer was out of it, and FT's ginger ale isn't as good. I noticed Q Ginger, a brand I hadn't seen before, was "on sale" -- though it's cheeky to say that about a $7 bottle of ginger ale. But then I never thought I'd get used to paying Fever Tree's prices, either.<br /><br />Problem is, this isn't that special a drink. It's a pleasant ginger ale, but nowhere near spicy enough. The lack of HFCS is a plus, but not enough to justify the outrageous price. If your taste runs to Seagrams or Vernors and you want to try something drier (but only slightly more flavorful), you might enjoy this more than I did.<br /><br />But for those of us who prefer the tingle of Fever Tree, a decided disappointment.

These bones are the same ones I had previously purchased at BJ's for a lot cheaper.  These bones are made in Mexico, not the United States.  I had to throw out many of the bones from the package I bought at BJ's.  These bones are NOT premium quality.  I will never again purchase these bones for my dog.

review/summary: Don't be fooled by the weight
review/text: These are quality rawhide treats.  My dog loves them.<br /><br />But if you pay attention you will see amazon lists the weight of the package as 7 lbs.  I used this weight to compare against other rawhide treats.  This package appeared to have the best weight per dollar ratio and that is what I based my purchasing decision on.<br /><br />When I opened the box I saw the package was marked "net weight 5 lbs." (true weight was 5 lbs. 2 oz.).  What happened to the other two pounds?!  That is a large discrepancy.<br /><br />I realize the weight amazon lists is for shipping purposes.  But for a bulk product such as this, the shipping weight should reflect the product weight within an ounce or two.<br /><br />In summary the product quality is great.  The value for the price is marginal (you can get 5 lbs. of rawhide for cheaper).  And the accuracy of amazon's listing is downright misleading.

review/text: My 65-lb Weim loves these chews - they are definitely a great value.  But PLEASE WATCH your dog as he/she is chewing on the last 2-3 inches of the chew!  My dog hasn't choked yet, but the last little bit of beef hide becomes lodged at the back of her jaw so and she starts licking/thrusting her tongue to dislodge it...and that's when I have to reach into the back of her throat and pull it out.  She has never choked per se, but I'm sure she would if we weren't watching her.  I'm not saying you should avoid these chews (or similar chews) altogether, but you MUST only give your dog a chew like this while you're supervising.

review/text: I bought these for my 9 month old puppy due to the fact he was chewing me out of house and home.  PETCO loved seeing me drag out bag after bag of raw hide chew bones.  I found these chew bones on Amazon and loved them.  These are a great value due to the price per treat vs the time it takes my puppy to consume them.  These treats last twice as long as the PETCO and PETSMART chews and they are less than half the cost.  The only thing is the high shipping cost.  All in all I am very pleased with this product and would recommend them.

They were high quality good thick roll that provided a solid three hours of chewing for my extra large dog.  But I recently reordered these by clicking on my order history and received a totally different product.  It is partialy my fault because I didn't notice the supplier had changed.  The product I received did not match the description.  The rolls were 12"-14" and much thinner.  They aren't bad but they don't last as long.  And I was a little disappointed in Amazon selling a totally different product under the same link.

Fair Trade and Donut Shop are the household staples, and for Keurig coffee, it's not bad.  Both produce a decent cup - stronger on the smaller cup setting if you want full bodied flavor, and closer to diner coffee on the larger cup setting.  The 50-count package is a great way to buy.

review/summary: Coffee is good; delivery was not!
review/text: Purchased this product  because my regular brand was not available.  The flavor is good,although my preferred brand is better.  Because my "brand" wasn't available again, I decided to subscribe to Green Mountain's Columbian coffee. Just prior to my next scheduled delivery I received an e mail that my preferred brand was in stock. I'm a Prime member and expected my Green Mountain order  in a day or two, but I did not receive my coffee for a week.  What's the point of subscribing & prime when your order is that late? I ordered my old favorite which I received in two days, one day after my late subscription.  I had contacted customer service regarding the late delivery and an accommodation was made, but I did cancel my subscription to Green Mounttain. (hence the 4 stars)

review/summary: Great food but don't be fooled by price
review/text: The food is great.<br /><br />But something has to be done about companies using ridiculous "list Prices" as a selling point.  There is no where in the country where this food is selling for $120 as is claimed here.  It is just a gimmick to make there price look good.  But there is a time when a gimmick turns to fraud and I think this is it.<br /><br />Studies have shown that the the variation in prices is higher online than in brick and mortar stores - you aren't guaranteed a good price without looking around regardless of where it is coming from.

review/text: Taro is a purple potato that has a very subtle taste normally.

Except, most Asian markets sell them for $2.00, $3.00 at most.  $10.00 is highway robbery.<br /><br />Bottom line: taste alone, this gets 5 stars.  At $10.00, rating drops down to 2 stars.

review/summary: They make a great gift.
review/text: On a whim, I sent a 2 lb bag of these cherries to my Mom as a Summertime "Thinking of You" gift. She adored them!  Months later when I asked her what she'd like for Christmas, she immediately said she'd love another bag of cherries.  This was a nice change from her usual reply of "You don't need to spend your money on me...I don't need anything," which I've been hearing for years.<br /><br />I think they are so appealing to my mother because she has a sweet tooth that she rarely indulges.  She is very health-conscious and won't eat junk food.  I assumed she'd enjoy these cherries in her salads or in her oatmeal, but she says she always just eats them plain, "like candy."<br /><br />I've recently had more cherries shipped directly to my Mom's address.  Gift-giving doesn't get any more convenient than that!<br /><br />Long story short--These make a great gift for those hard-to-buy-for people.

We don't live convenient to a good source of dried fruit, so buying in bulk is great for us.<br /><br />If you love cherries, the flavor is excellent, and is not hindered by over-sweetening or by additives. A great way to add fruit in your diet. These do come in one large bag, so we divided them into convenient quantities in freezer bags and froze part of them.

review/summary: Traverse Bay Dried Cherries:
review/text: I have summered in the Traverse City area most of my life.  Normally, I buy 2 or 3 boxes of these dried cherries each summer and take them home with me to Atlanta.  (Traverse City bills itself as the cherry capitol of the world -whether it is remains to be seen - but they sure have a big cherry crop.)  This summer, I was unable to go to Michigan, and ran out of cherries in July.  Imagine my amazement (and happiness) when I found not only dried cherries at Amazon.com, but my actual brand - Traverse Bay cherries - and at a competitive price.  While this may look expensive to the uninitiated, 1/4 pound of dried cherries sells for about $8 at the gourmet or grocery stores.  Doing the math, that would put 4 pounds at $128.  Now... about the cherries, they are heavenly.  Put them in salads, in cookies instead of raisins (so much better), in your oatmeal, or just eat them with your fingers.  Tip:  transfer them to a zip-lock bag as soon as you open them.  They do tend to get hard if not kept zipped up.  I keep them in the pantry at room temp.

These cherries have an off taste as if they have been in storage too long and are far too over plump as to suggest extra sugar has been added to increase weight.  Michigan cherries from Traverse Bay has been an excellent product in the past.  I suspect these are second rate in some fashion.

review/summary: Good and good value, but not the best
review/text: I am glad that another reviewer pointed out that these ship from different farms.  The first order I received was very nice, almost as good as the Kirklland brand (but not as large or plump,) still very good.  the second batch were smaller, dryer, maybe it is because it is summer now and it is last year's crop?  In any event I was much less impressed by the second box.  If I had received those first I would not have subscribed.  Now if that is due to seasons then it is to be expected but the second batch did indeed ship from a different company than the first.<br />Even at the lowest price I have seen here (about $18) these cost a bit more by the ounce than the ones we get at costco... and that is in the most expensive place on earth (Hawaii).  If they had them all the time I would buy those exclusively, but they don't.  Maybe they only ship/ sell when they are fresh?<br /><br />I do not want to knock these to much.  They are good and a much better value than at the average supermarket.  We just have a better option.  If they were as good the very small price difference wouldn't matter as the convenience would more than make it up.  But I find the Kirklands better and more consistent in quality.  I also wish they would not add sugar or oil to these :(  I really do not want added sugar or fat in dried fruit!  I suppose it beats chemicals, but I don't buy chemically treated fruit.  These are good, but not the best I have had, and I am about as far away from cherry country as one can get.

review/summary: Traverse Bay Dried Cherries
review/text: I missed getting my dried cherries from home in Traverse City, Michigan. The 4 pound box is a great size! I have not been able to find anything like it since moving to Washington. And the taste of the cherries is incomparable! Had a co-worker taste them without knowing where they came from, and she wanted to know where I bought them because she really liked the tart taste.

review/summary: Wonderful Cherries, Wonderful Transaction
review/text: We usually buy a big box of dried cherries when we go to Michigan on vacation, but our source quit handling the large boxes.  My sister-in-law suggested I check online, so I decided to check amazon.  I was pleased to find the fruit available for far less than I paid on my trips home to the Wolverine state.  Great cherries, great price, great transaction!  Thanks amazon!

review/summary: I bought this to make cherry wine
review/text: I wanted to try a batch of cherry wine but couldn't stand the thought of pitting 100000 cherries. This seemed almost ideal. Had to guess the dry to fresh weight ratio since information is not readily available. 1lb dry equals 3lbs fresh seemed like reasonable estimate so a box of cherries should yield 4 gallons of wine. Good recipes are on the web so look it up. Batch is 6 weeks old and seems promising. Dry & slightly tart. Maybe ready to share with friends by Christmas time.

review/summary: hard cherries
review/text: THIS IS THE 3RD SHIPPMENT OF TRAVERSE BAY DRIED CHERRIES I'VE PURCHASED FROM AMAZON.  THIS TIME THE CHERRIES WERE HARDER THEN THOSE IN THE PAST AND THUS HARDER TO CHEW.  THIS MAY BE DUE TO LACK OF ADQUATE MOISTURE BEFORE PACKING OR THEY WERE STORED TO LONG AND BECAME DRIED OUT,PRIOR TO SALE.  WHAT EVER THE CAUSE THEY WERE NOT AN ENJOYABLE ADDITION TO THE MORNING CEREAL AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. WILL I BUY AGAIN? I'M NOT SURE AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

review/summary: Best dried cherries on the market!
review/text: We've tried many brands of dried cherries but these are the best.  At first I didn't think I would like having sugar on them but,  honestly, the sugar acts as a preservative and keeps them moist and they are not too sweet.  Just a balanced blend of sweet & tart and soooo moist. My favorite snack is a handful of the cherries mixed with a handful of slivered almonds.  They are excellent on salads and cereal, especially on oatmeal.

review/text: These cherries come packaged just as they are described.  They are tasty, fresh and great straight from the bag.  I often take them as part of my packed lunch to work and always mix them in my home-made muesli.  The subscription service is a great option for regular repeat ordering and is easy to adjust when needed.

review/summary: Awesome Cherries
review/text: Any time you order (even when reading previews) it is a gamble.  Nearly all of the previews for this were good, but I read one which was not and called the validity of all the other previews into question.  I was concerned, but ordered any way.  I am glad I did.  These cherries were sweet, moist, and had that amazing cherry flavor that you usually only find in long cooked cherries.  They were well packaged and delicious.  If I need cherries again, I will definitely buy these.

review/summary: Traverse Bay Fruit--dried cherries
review/text: I love these cherries.  I heard dried cherries were supposed to be good for arthritis.  When I saw these on the Amazon site, I decided to try them.  I had been buying dried cherries in the grocery store and paying lots for them.  Since having these cherries available for a very good price, I eat a handful of them every day, and my arthritis is at the least, bearable.  I really believe they help.  One thing for sure,  they don't hurt anything.

review/text: I have always eaten cherries fresh but as always if you don't eat them quick enough they will go bad like any other fresh fruit.  I was told that they can be found dry so I started my search online and found them with amazon.com at first I was not sure if I wanted 4 pound but decided more is better, I'm glad I did because they are everyone's favorite in my house. Thanks Traverse Bay Fruit Co.

review/text: I've bought Traverse Bay's cranberries in the past when they were cheaper than the 48oz Craisins bag I find here on Amazon sometimes. Last time I decided to go for the cherries. Delicious! Such an interesting tart, sweet, almost spiced flavor. I put them in my oatmeal almost every morning. I'm ordering a second box now!

review/summary: Nice change in taste
review/text: Trying dried cherries was something that appealed to me, because cherries have notable antioxidant effects and the only other ways to eat cherries regularly are to buy juice at the natural food store or buy the yucky canned cherries in heavy syrup. I have access to Flathead (MT) cherries but they are perishable and only available fresh in the fall. I found that Traverse added a bit of sugar and sunflower oil to keep their product soft. I like the resulting taste, very tart, but meaty. Four pounds is a load of cherries, but I split up the shipment into plastic bags and settled them in the lower area of the refrig, opening just one bag emptied into a mason jar on the counter for a quick snack, with an eye on calorie counting.
