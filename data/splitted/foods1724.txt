review/summary: Premium dog food, budget price
review/text: My shih tzu loves this food. We have tried feeding him a variety of different dog foods and this is the only one he'll eat without regularly mixing in some "human food". Previously he was on Purina Beneful mixed with Prescription Diet WD, both of which I came to find out are low quality products. Chicken Soup For The Dog Lover's Soul ranks 4/5 stars at Dog Food Advisor and the high rating is well deserved. Check out the ingredients list. This product contains "real" meat and vegetables. My dog no longer has digestion problems and his stools are now normal. He is full of energy and is enjoying life more than ever. I simply cannot recommend CSFTDLS highly enough.

review/summary: Very Good, but WAY to high in price..........
review/text: We have been using this dog food for a few years & it is one of the better ones on the market.<br />The only problem is that they have raised the price WAY out of line. I can buy this at 29.00 a case<br />right down the street. I was buying it here when they had it for 27.29, but when they raised the price,<br />I said "Good Bye" to Amazon!

review/text: we have a small dog that seems to have tummy issues on some of the high end dog foods that we have tried. The vet said maybe they are too rich for her system; the pate' dog foods. I looked into this dog food and found it to be highly rated by organizations that do not stand to profit by the sales of the Chicken Soup for Dog foods. Our dog has been on this for 3 years now and does very well. OUr vet always gives her a thumbs up for her health so we know it is a good dog food.

review/text: After extensive reviews of many brands of dog food, I choose this food for several reasons.  First and foremost is the fact that this food is regarded as a high quality dog food on all sites I researched.  I also like the fact that I can purchase this food in a case of 24 cans and the price is fantastic.  My dog loves this food and licks her bowl clean every time.  I feel very confident that I am feeding my much loved dog a well balanced and healthy diet.

review/summary: Woof!  We Love It!
review/text: I made the mistake of reading up on big brand pet foods and was freaked out about how bad they are - dry food and what's really in them!  After that I had no choice but to switch to quality food.  We've been doing the wet and dry Chicken Soup's for about 6 months now and my dog loves them - well he likes the dry but he LOVES the wet.  I've bought 3 cases so far of the wet and had no problems with how they were shipped and the cans were not dented - the last batch I bought was in October.  I have a 15 lb cairn terrier and give him 1/4 can each day (dinner) so the case lasts me a good long time.  I also give him a fish oil pill with it.  So far so good.  I bought a "Bamboo" pet food lid/scooper on Ebay that fits the can perfectly and has a built in scoop so I don't have to dirty a spoon every feeding.  That helps.

review/summary: My Dogs Love It
review/text: I bought this canned food to use as a supplement to use in conjunction with dry dog food. I have two small dogs and feed them two small meals two times a day. I mix just enough canned food to make the dry food more appealing in taste. Prior to using this food one of our dogs was always ready to eat and the other dog could take it or leave it usually eating only one meal a day. Now since using Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul, both dogs are eager to eat each meal and lick their bowls clean. They have even learned the sound of their dinner being prepared and immediately come to the kitchen in anticipation of the meal. I warm up the food before mixing it with their dry food as I do not use a whole can of food for each meal and keep it stored in the refrigerator. This certainly has a great appeal for our dogs, I will purchase more when this runs out.

review/summary: Excellent Quality, Excellent Value, Dogs Love It
review/text: I switched to CSFDLS dry food a couple months ago with excellent results on lessening both the amount of food I need to feed my two bulldogs, as well as the amount of gas and loose stools they have. I continued to top their dry food with a little bit of canned each day. I have just received my first shipment of Chicken Soup Canned, and my dogs have gone nuts over this stuff. It smells heavenly, the ingredients are top quality, and I think we're probably now a 100% Chicken Soup Brand family. For 24 cans, this is an excellent value for a top quality product.<br /><br />For the record, I had no issues with dented or damaged cans. It arrived in the original case, packed tightly with plastic, and then the case enclosed in a cardboard box.

review/text: Since I am following the weight watchers points plus program and have multiple food allergies as well, I thought this would be a good healthy snack that I would enjoy.  Unfortunately the flavor of the added whey protein is so strong that I didnt care for this product at all.  If you like or dont mind the flavor of whey then give it a try.  However if you find whey protein offensive I would stay away from this product.  If Better Bowls would remove the whey and settle for just the protein derived from the added milk I think it would be a very good snack.

My suggestion to those of you who purchased...buy the 12", as others have said they can easily be cut in two. I use my garden branch cutter.<br />Keep them in the freezer. Your dog won't mind and the smell and freshness will keep. Give it frozen or let it thaw.<br />I have bought bigger and American made bullies, but my dog prefers this brand.

I ordered these by accident last time (wasn't paying enough attention!!) and although the dog still loves them they smell incredibly bad!  The longer, thinner sticks no not have this bad smell (unless you stick them right by your nose I suppose).  As soon as I opened the pack of these sticks the smell infused the entire house and when I gave the dog one his paws carried the horrible smell for days afterward.  I finally put him in the sink and washed his paws.<br /><br />I'd recommend the longer 12 inch sticks over these simply for the smell.  I ended up just throwing this pack out and ordering the longer ones.

review/text: The price on these is great, and they don't smell as bad as other brands we have purchased in the past - but our 25lb Corgi mix polished one off in 6 minutes flat!  The first one we gave him, we left the room for a few minutes and when we came back it was gone... we thought he stashed it somewhere and looked high and low to find it in the living room. So we decided to give him a 2nd one and actually time it... completely gone in 6 minutes, no joke. Other brands have lasted him at least half an hour, usually longer.

review/summary: Great value, not overly smelly
review/text: I was really leery about getting these since I'd read several reviews complaining about the smell, but they were so much cheaper than what I could buy at the store, and my (teething) puppy just loves them, that I decided to go ahead and get them. I'm very pleased with my purchase!  They were a bit smelly when I opened the bag, but I let them air out and the smell is much better. They do smell some but no more than the ones I've bought at my local pet store, so unless you really can't tolerate the smell of the ones you currently buy, don't pass these up becuase of other reviews.  My pup is very pleased with them. The sizes were mostly around 5"-6" and about 1/4" to 1/2" diameter, but there were some shorter pieces in the pack. There were about 25 pieces in the bag, and about 5 of those were the shorter ones- some of which were only 3" but 1" around. I will definitely be buying these again. For those that are wondering, they are a product of Brazil.

review/text: My dog's love "bully" sticks and I have to say I rather them be chewing on these than raw hides. Granted this was the best buy I could find for bully sticks online since I am living overseas, but when we were back in the states we were able to buy a large bag, same quality, same thickness, but 12" instead of six for the same price at Costco. My lab mix goes through a 6" inch bully stick within 3 minutes and I still have yet to find the same quality of bully sticks in a 12" or larger. For the price this is great, and if you have medium to smaller dogs this is a perfect treat.

review/summary: Good deal, but worst smelling bully sticks I've ever had
review/text: The size of these bully sticks are exactly what had been advertised, which I am satisfied with.  However, out of all the brands I've bought for my dog, these are the absolute worst smelling ones I have ever had in my house.  I don't know if it was just my bag, but they smell horrendous.  After a couple of minutes of my dog chewing them, my house began to smell like cow manure.  Other than that, they are everything they were said to be.  They keep her busy, she loves them, but I will not be buying these again.  Then again, I live in an apartment.  If you live in a house, and have a separate room for the dog to chew these in, or can let them enjoy it outside, then they could be for you.

review/summary: Awful smell but dog enjoyed
review/text: These bully sticks stunk so badly that after I gave two of them to my 70 pound dog, he almost smelled like the sticks!  Needless to say, I gave the remainder of them to a man whose dogs live outdoors.  The price wasn't worth it as I went to a local store and paid three times as much for some bully sticks, but they didn't smell.

review/text: This is the second brand of bully sticks we bought for our dogs. I like that they're pretty similar in size/thickness and unlike the other brand, they don't have random 'flaps' of who knows what. That said, these are awful smelling. The previous brand I purchased had an odor but not too bad. This brand is rather foul smelling.

review/summary: Bully Sticks
review/text: I purchased these Bully Sticks for our 3 greyhounds which love to chew them.  I am very careful as to what I allow my greyhounds to chew since I am afraid of my greyhounds chewing something that they could choke on.  The Bully Sticks did not break apart into little pieces as other rawhides chews can that could have gotten stuck in their throat.  The Bully Sticks gave my greyhounds lots of chewing fun & helped to clean their teeth alittle.  I would recommend these Bully Sticks for any dog.

review/summary: Quality of Item
review/text: I was not happy with the product at all.  The sticks are all varying lengths, some as short as 3 inches, some as long as 8 inches.  Also, they are a wide range of thickness.  Some are smaller than a pencil and others are huge!<br /><br />Alot of them have knots in them which are hard for the dogs to chew. Quite a few of them also have curved ends on them which also make it hard for the dogs to chew.<br /><br />They are not at all the quality of the sticks you can buy in the stores.<br /><br />They may be okay for large dogs, but I have dogs in the 10-12 lb range and they are having a hard time with them.

review/text: I've bought the 12" sticks from same company.  This time, I wanted to avoid the trouble of cutting them into small pieces for my small dogs.  You'd think the product would be the same, but surprisingly, these shorter sticks had a pungent odor.  Previous sticks had a very mild odor which would become a little stronger when my dogs started chewing on them.  These smell very strong.

review/summary: Not for the Professional Chewer in your life
review/text: First, let me say that this is not a bad product, and extremely reasonable at the price. Our local pet store sells single bully sticks of this size for minimum of $5-6 each.<br />All that said, i believe anyone's level of satisfaction with this product will to some extend depend on how much experience one has had with bully sticks in general, and what you are using the basis for comparison.<br /><br />I have two dogs, pitbull and lab mix, who are both seriously  accomplished chewers. Over the last 7+ years i have spent what amounts to a small fortune on a variety of bully sticks from numerous different vendors. I am not adding it up because i think the total would scare me.. anyway i digress.<br /><br />One of these keeps my dogs occupied for at  most 15 minutes. i have given them other sticks that lasted 2 -3x as long, but again at double the price. A couple of other points to note, especially if you're new to the world of bully sticks.<br /><br />These are NOT odor free (not that they claim to be - but be warned, they be stinky)<br />Take it from an old hand here, store these in a ziplock bag that seals. the packaging that they are sold in will not suffice. Trust me on this one..really<br />In my experience if i need something that is going to last for awhile, i'm usually better off going to an online merchant who specializes and sells different sizes and shapes in bulk. They usually have deals if you buy a certain minimum amount.<br /><br />Also, no matter how safe they seem, don't leave dogs unsupervised  in or out of a crate when theyre chewing on one of these.

review/text: Our dogs LOVE these!  I think they are a great value based on what we pay for these locally. The size is great for small-medium dogs.  Our dogs usually wolf down bully sticks in minutes - these are thick enough to keep them busy for at least an hour, sometimes longer.  I will say, though, that they are among the more stinky of the bully sticks we've tried.

review/text: I have two little dogs and the shihtzu will eat these about halfway and get tired of them, but my other similarly sized dog just loves these and will sit and chew on it for an hour.  I have gotten other brands of these in the past that have smelled horrible and even seemed to stain the rug, but these leave no mess, not so much as a crumb, and there is no smell at all to them.  If my terrier is any indication, they taste delicious but I take his word for that.  Considering what I've paid for these in the pet boutique type stores, these are a great bargain and I get them delivered.  Have no qualms about getting these; your dogs will thank you.

review/summary: FINALLY something my dog will chew (besides my shoes)!
review/text: My puppy does not like any of her chew toys.  She does, however, LOVE to chew things that do not belong to her.  As you can imagine, this adds another level of stress to the already challenging work of raising a pup.  I heard about bully sticks and thought they would be a great choice for my dog.<br /><br />I found a package of this (Cadet) brand in a pack of (4) pieces of the 5" size on clearance at my local grocery store.  So, please note that my review is for a slightly different item than the one shown here...I can only speak to the quality of the stick and not to the sizes or to the packaging or to the value per dollar for THIS package of bully sticks.<br /><br />That said, my puppy is in love with her first bully stick. She is gnawing on it as I type this, in fact!  Happy me!<br /><br />I do not smell the stick from here (about three feet away).  I put my nose INSIDE of the package, and smelled a mild meaty smell.<br /><br />I managed to get the partially gnawed stick from my pup and took a big whiff of a wet end, and I smelled a mild aroma similar to bacon.<br /><br />For what it is worth, I consider myself to be a person with an average to above average sense of smell, but then, the scent of smoky meat does not bother me one bit (we cook a lot of bacon).  I realize that I might not be the best judge.<br /><br />So, I asked my two daughters to smell it also.  They did not like the smell of the inside of the package, but each had to put her nose RIGHT INSIDE to smell anything.  Also, neither claims to be able to smell the stick while petting the dog, but if they stick their face right up by where she is chewing, they report it to smell like dog food.<br /><br />At the rate she is going, this stick could last her for a couple of days to a week.  I will be curious to see how it goes.<br /><br />My dog is a medium-sized breed, and is still a puppy.  The smaller pieces would probably not work out for her once she has grown up, but they are great for the size she is now (approx. 15 lbs.).<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful!

review/text: My 10 months old labradoodle pup loves these.

I saw some other reviewers wrote about this, but the odor (especially while your dog is gnawing at it) is VERY strong.  The solution I came up with this is to give them to my dog when we leave her in her crate.<br /><br />Over all, this is a good product.

review/summary: Great value, will buy again
review/text: I'm always on the lookout for treats for my two 4 yr old shihtzus. Bull sticks have always been one of their favorites, but they are just always so expensive in pet stores (2-3$ for a small one)! I figured I will give the online ones a try. This package does the trick for the pups and my budget too. The size varies, anywhere from tiny ones from ~ 1 cm to 2-3 cm in diameter (see the image I upoloaded). The length is about ~15 cm for all of them. I immediately gave the biggest one in the pack to my housemate's Huskey, and he went don to business. He loved it and it lasted him on and off good part of the evening (~2 hours). The shihtzus got the smaller ones of course. The male (big chewer) finished his in about 20 minutes at most. He absolutely loved it. The girl (much weaker teeth) didn't get even 1/3rd through wit hers before getting tired and leaving it (the male pup finished hers too later that evening). The smell of these is not amazing if you bring them up close, but nothing out of ordinary. My batch was made in Brazil if I recall correctly. These will last for a while and they are definitely worth the money. Highly recommended!

I just ordered these for the first time and they were delivered yesterday. I have seen some that are extremely thin so I was glad to see that these were a decent size. They did smell pretty bad when I first opened the package but since then they have aired out and I don't notice them much. I've bought other ones that have smelled far worse. My dogs liked these ones so I would definitely recommend.

review/summary: My dogs love...
review/text: Bull sticks were recommended by our dog trainer because they are natural, as opposed to rawhides. She says that it's important for dogs to chew 20-30 minutes a day. Our dogs are as picky as could be and won't eat anything.  They love these.  They don't want them all of the time, but when they do, they eat the whole thing.

review/summary: My dogs' favorite treat!!
review/text: I've been buying bully sticks since I first got a dog. Until I found these, I was paying $2-$4 per stick!  I was hesitant to buy these because some of the reviews say how badly they smell.  I will agree, the smell is very strong....but my dog loves these bully sticks so much that the smell is totally worth it!  My dogs are about 13 pounds apiece, and one stick per dog lasts at least one full day.  They love these so much that they've started turning their noses up at the treats we used to regularly give them!  As long as this product stays as reasonably priced as it is now, I'll keep buying them.

review/text: I like to buy my dog bully sticks instead of rawhide, because I read that they are better for him to digest. He's only 15 pounds. He really likes these bully sticks, and they last a whole lot longer than some of the other ones I bought on amazon.com. A pound for 20 dollars is a great deal. My neighbor's dog now tries to get into my house for the bully sticks! Oh well, it's worth it.

review/summary: Not a bad deal
review/text: Our bag had 19 sticks in it - only 1 of them pencil thin - the others were much wider.<br />My 2 dogs are small, 10 & 14 lbs.  Both like these and work at them steady for hours.  When they get real small and chewed down, I'll throw them out and give them a new one.<br />They do have a smokey smell if you are very close to them but since they are chewing them and I am not - not an issue for my nose ;)<br />All are pretty much 6", no 4" sticks in this bag.<br />At less than $1 a stick - worth it considering what I usually spend locally ($3.99 @ for the same size)

review/summary: REVISED REVIEW:  STINKS!!!!
review/text: I initially said I would not buy these again. But I'm back to revise my original review. The sticks smell pretty bad in the bag. You'll get a nice whiff when you cut the bag open. They smell worse when they're wet with dog saliva. Just my luck, the first one I gave my dog was so rancid and smelly, I had to wear rubber gloves and hold these for my dog to chew because I don't want his paws smelling like it afterwards. But then his breath smells awful afterwards, too, and he's not allowed to give anyone kisses. After the first stick, my husband concluded that he hates these. He says they smell awful. It's true--but at varying degrees. Some are awful and others are less smelly.<br /><br />However, my dog loved these from the first stick. So even though I swore after that first one that I would never buy them again...I'm back to buy more :) I think there were a couple of "stinkers" in the pack. But the rest smelled OK. I'd say 80% of the sticks were OK. Every once in a while, there'd would be a really smelly one. I'll just take it from my dog, throw it away and give him a new one. Even if I have to throw a couple of them away, the price is still better here at Amazon than buying them individually at the local pet store.<br /><br />If you want to try a natural, long-lasting, safer, and more digestible alternative to raw-hide, give these a try. Make sure to give your pooch a big fresh bowl of water to go with his bully stick.

review/summary: An Apple A Day...
review/text: Now, I'm already a big fan of Red Leaf Tea's green apple matcha, but that one really does taste like a green apple, tart and sweet all at the same time. Which is great, but every once in a while a girl needs a smoother apple, a juicer, sweeter apple, which is what I hope to gain from this matcha. I'm eager to try it as a latte with vanilla soy milk and some of their Cinnamon Matcha...I'm hoping for a apple pie with ice cream kind of drink. I love apples and apple juice, so whenever I spot an apple blend, I have to try it. And there are so many things you can do with apple that I'm hoping to be able to do with this apple matcha. Apple matcha pie, anyone? Or apple fritters with an apple matcha icing...yes, please! I make homemade donuts occasionally...can you imagine a big apple cake donut covered in cinnamon sugar? I may have to make donuts in the near future. I hope this matcha lives up to all of the plans I have for it. And I hope it gives me the energy to follow through on those plans! Because now that I've mentioned it, if I don't make donuts in the near future, my wife will be devastated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is just not for me. The smell of the dry matcha has the smell of the more bitter matchas I've had from Red Leaf Tea, and that smell carried through into the taste of the brewed tea. It tastes something like apple candy when you power through the bitterness, which is nice, but far from the apple juice I was craving. I'm not an apple candy type of girl, unless it's a sour apple. It might still be good as a latte, but I won't be cooking with it, sadly. Still it isn't terrible, and the bitterness seems to fade over time. Maybe it will still hold up to donuts, as the amount of sugar in them will balance out the bitterness. I don't really think this is one I need to get more of, and if any of my local friends want a taste, I'm happy to share. I'll experiment with what I have left, maybe I can find a way to fall in love with this tea. But personally I'm going to stick with the Green Apple matcha, also from Red Leaf Teas.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I'm not a coffee expert.<br /><br />Time Machine: San Francisco 2009<br /><br />I usually pour coffee from the thermos at work, and rarely keep track of the type of coffee I am drinking. My mornings start with a protein shake and a jug of water. I don't get to my cup of coffee until about 8:30am after it has been sitting in a thermos for an hour, and I say on average I drink one cup a day, although sometimes on those long Thursday afternoons, I'll have a small splash keep me in gear. Drinking coffee outside of the office was never appealing.<br /><br />Until one Saturday morning my roommate received a package of Cafe Britt Poas Volcanic Earth Coffee. Ours was whole bean, and I mention that so you can imagine what it's like waking up on Saturday morning, door open, hung over, listening to your roommate fumble around in the kitchen in an attempt to ground coffee.<br /><br />Needless to say, as Cafe Britt brewed it tainted the air with a sweet and and sour smell. I pulled myself into the kitchen to a tall glass of Costa Rican goodness and it was amazing. Like winning the jackpot in Vegas, it was a great feeling and changed the way I think about coffee.<br /><br />I find the Cafe Britt Volcanic to taste like the sweet smell of the jungle. That's right, the jungle: Grown into a bean, ground, and brewed into your cup. It's smooth, dry, sometimes chocolatey, minty, even tea like.<br /><br />I since keep a bag or two in a dry dark place when not in use. It's a bit expensive but since I only brew it on the weekends, it lasts. I've experimented mixing grounds but I can never seem to get it as good as the pure stuff. I've had all different kinds of Cafe Britt from Costa Rica, and they all have their ups and downs, this however is a major win.<br /><br />If you're interested in coffee, and are looking to try something new, this is definitely worth it.

review/text: I ordered what I thought was five "4" packs of Smartbones medium size. What arrived was five "single" packs of the Smartbones medium size. The price for a four pack was a little more than half the local store price for the same items.... But for a single bone it works out to more than double the cost. I don't know if the problem is with the web/computer system or if the packer simply grabbed the wrong items. As I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon my only choice was to return the items. I'm afraid to reorder as I can't be certain the same mistake will not reoccur. Too bad as the price would be good and my dog loves the product.

Black, fuzzy mold was widespread on the cardboard box and container label.  This time I just asked for a refund - I'll not try a third time.

review/summary: Excellent sauce but packaging could use some improvement!
review/text: This has to be one of my favorite Italian sauces to date - better than most restaurants I've been to and I eat out all the time. The sauce is rich and loaded with olives and my favorite - capers. I've tried creating several recipes and even just pouring some on plain pasta - the sauce makes the dish.<br /><br />My only reason with not going 5 stars has to do with the potential for receiving an opened container. Fortunately, I did not have an 'opened' jar in my box but 2 of the 4 had the paper seals broken and I was a little concerned. The inner foil seal was still in tact so I felt confident eating the product. A simple addition of bubble wrap or softer styrofoam packaging would solve this minor issue. Fix that and you've got a 5 star product!
