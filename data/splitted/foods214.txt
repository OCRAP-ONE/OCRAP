review/summary: Good Gift for Coffee Fanatics
review/text: I bought this sampler for my Mother and she loved it. This is a woman who does not function without two or three pots of coffee a day so she knows her coffee. As for me, I am not much of a coffee drinker but I tried most of the flavors and thought that they were very good without being overly strong. We got about two pots (8 to 12 cups) per bag without the coffee being too watered down. Definitely a hit with any coffee drinkers in your life. I sprung for the gift wrapping and was not disappointed. Be warned though, the box it is shipped in will have the name of the company and what is inside of it, so if you are trying to surprise someone maybe have it shipped to a friends house first. Otherwise very happy with the product.

review/text: I recieved this item the other day and while the packaging looks really nice, It was much smaller than expected, although the "brews 60 cups" is right, only if you use the super tiny 6oz cups that are on your coffee maker or like your coffee pretty weak.<br /><br />I would say that these bags are pretty small and you "might" get 3 coffee maker uses per bag if you're lucky, probably more like 2 uses per bag as they are much smaller than expected.  The quality of the product is VERY good however and I'm sure my brother in law will love this gift since he usually drinks awful folgers!<br /><br />Shipped fast and I would order from them again for gift purposes!

review/summary: Weak, poor quality
review/text: This is a very, very mild ginger tea.  I take at least 2 bags in 6oz of water to even taste it.<br />I also found the quality rather cheap compared to similar priced teas.  Here are just some of the problems I found:<br />1. Cannot open sachet without scissors.  Many are missing tear marks.<br />2. The tag falls off on half the tea bags.  So you end up fishing the bag out of your tea.<br />3. The tag is glued to the sachet on several (maybe 20%) of the bags.<br />4. The tea bag rips apart when opening the sachet or when squeezing out your tea.

review/summary: A Little Sweet but Still Delicious!
review/text: Crystal Light's Peach Iced Tea is a little sweeter than other flavors like the Raspberry Lemonade. It has a very mild tea flavor that is pleasant and not overpowering. Since we already lug tons of bottled water from Costco it is great not to have to also buy bottled drinks. The Crystal Light packets make drinking more water a breeze. Since I started using these packets I keep water in the refrigerator and mix up some tea for when I'm reading or out shopping. I also love to make slushies with this drink mix. Just put a bottle in the freezer for a few hours and then shake vigorously. I will say these "on the go" flavors can be a bit addictive. With so much variety in flavors these drinks really make life a little more fun.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I am a Snapple diet peach tea drinker and when I saw that they had come out with an instant "on the go" I was ecstatic. I was not happy with the flavor or the way it didn't dissolve easily. However this crystal light version is so much better. The flavor is not exactly like the Snapple but it is very pleasant and it dissolves perfectly. I actually use more water to mix it than suggested just to stretch it out a little but it still has a good flavor.

review/summary: Tastes Great, Avoid if Caffeine Sensitive
review/text: I absolutely love the Crystal Light On the Go mixes, especially the Iced Tea flavor. Apart from tasting great, the mixes also help you drink much more throughout the day.<br /><br />The only downside of these are that they contain a lot of caffeine, so if you're sensitive to caffeine you might have want to choose a different flavor (some of the other flavors are caffeine free), as this one can lead to headaches and nausea.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Tastes great<br />- Price<br />- Helps you drink more<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Contains a lot of caffeine

review/summary: My favorite Crystal Light flavor
review/text: I love the peach flavored iced tea.  It is just right flavor-wise, which is not the case with some of the other CL flavors.  For example, the raspberry is sooo sweet and pretty unbearable.  But, the tea is a good mix and buying it here is cheaper that at the grocery.  The price keeps going up locally, and now they are up to over $2.50 a box for a pack of 10, which is ridiculous.  You used to be able to get this stuff for about .15 to .19 each.  That may not be a big deal for one pack, but when you drink as much of this as I do (probably 2 boxes a week), it starts to add up.<br /><br />I recommend the Peach Tea.  It's one of the few flavors that CL has not messed with in regards to taste.  It seems they have revamped most of the other flavors, but not this one.

On my pocket, backpack and car. I try to have them everywhere I can to prevent drinking soda. So far so good. These were recommended from my nutritionist. I had a bad soda habit. I would drink way too much soda in one day. She recommended to drink lots of water but if I had an urge to drink something sweet then to drink a crystal light drink. I haven't had a soda for a few months now. Now I drink lots of water and have about one to two of these packets everyday.

review/summary: great for the diabetic or low carber
review/text: though when compared to the usual white bread bun you might not choose this, if you are diabetic or a low carber, it is a no brainer. As with their hamburger buns, it is better to refigerate and the microwave for a few seconds to warm them. With regular bread microwaving makes them rubbery but with these it softens them just right. heating over bbq or toasting makes them too dry. also use more condiments than you would with regular buns. All in all the diabetic or low carber can have a hot dog on bun without raising the sugar unduely. Though they are expensive with shipping, it is worth it for your health.

review/text: This Pecan Pie really made an international journey. My son has been living in China for the past year and was really lonely for some good old fashion American food for the holidays. Pecan Pie is one of the favorites. We saw this boxed pie and couldn't pass it up! But we were surprised to learn how few ovens there are in China. Most of the food is steamed and fried. The lack of an oven was disappointing and we didn't hear much more until my son told me he had found some friends who had an American style oven and he had cooked the pie for them! It was really a huge hit. I notice this company makes other pies and I think I will send other over. I strongly suggest this 'pie in a box' for anyone who wants to give a special treat!

review/summary: Can't get enough!
review/text: I love this tea! I've been on a raspberry flavor kick for eons and as with everything else that has many variations and brands representing the same flavor, there are lots of hits and misses. I tried Bigelow's other raspberry (caffeinated)tea as well as a few others and they didn't have the punch that this decaffeinated one has. I add some sugar to a tall 18oz mug for my hot tea and I'm in heaven! Since this is made with "hibiscus, rose hips, apples, elderberries, natural & artificial raspberry flavors. Gluten free" might be why it's taste is more pronounced and might upset tea purists, I really don't care. I buy this for the great flavor. I would love if there were large single bags for ice tea pitcher filling as I wouldn't want to use up a box of bags in just a couple of pitchers, so they will remain only for my hot tea use.

review/text: I use this as iced tea and have been using large amounts of this product for some time.  It is $3.39/box localy.  I use a box every 4 days.  It adds up to allot of money.  Buying this on subscription, I am paying about $2.50/box (no shipping fee for Prime members).  That is a substantial difference in price.<br />Next....  This is a delightful iced tea.  To make 1 gallon I steep 10 bags in a about 2 cups water, and then steep them a second time.  Wring them out and add all to pitcher.  I then add 40 tabs equal and 2 individual packets lemonade (the kind intended for bottled water) and get a wonderful beverage that everyone loves.  Enjoy!!!!

review/text: Seeing the word "tangy" on the front of the box, I had high hopes of a refreshingly tart, vibrant raspberry herbal tea.  Instead I found it less like tea and more like a weakly flavored cup of liquid raspberry J-ello!  Leaving the bag in longer doesn't help either.  The first cup I made, I got distracted and the bag was left to steep 30 minutes before I took a sip.  I'll be switching back to Tazo Passion as soon as I finish the box.

review/summary: Great food, but with the October 2012 price increase, not sure it's a good value.
review/text: UPDATED REVIEW (10/7/2012):  I am disappointed to see that Merrick increased the price of this food 50%!  The 8-pound bag used to be $8.69, but is now $16.00 and some change.  Whole Earth Farms is supposed to be an affordable way for responsible pet owners to feed their pets Merrick quality, but it seems Merrick has decided to up the ante based on this food's popularity.  I'm very disappointed by the decision and may have to switch back to my previous brand.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  After deciding to switch from Nutro Max to Merrick Whole Earth Farms Adult Dry Dog Food, my dog literally does circles when it's time to eat.  The food is loaded with good stuff for my dog and it even smells better than our previous brand.  It obviously tastes better, too, because my dog just can't contain himself when it's time to eat.  His coat is shinier and seems really healthy, and on a semi-gross note, but important one, his stools have been much smaller; that tells me his body is absorbing more of the nutrition in this food than the last one.  I actually ended up reducing his food portion because he was gaining a little weight.  That's always a sign of a good dog food...the ability to feed less and the dog still receive great nutrition; that tells me there are much fewer fillers in this food than most.  I recommend you try it.

review/summary: My dogs really love this dog food
review/text: I recently switched to this dog food from Nature's Variety Prairie.<br /><br />So far I am very pleased with the dog food.  When switching, I was looking for a certain range of protein and fat and Merrick Whole Earth met the requirements I was looking for (a protein reading of 27%, a fat level of 14%) and chicken meal and turkey meal is the main source of animal protein.  The dog food was also "highly recommended" by an independent dog food advisor site that I use.<br /><br />My dogs really (really) like this food and they eat as soon as I put it down (even their morning meal which is dry food only), so the taste of this food must really be to their liking.  Despite the fact my dogs are rescues (and who knows what they were eating when they were wildly roaming the streets), they are picky and with the Nature's Variety, half the time they never ate their breakfast.  Also, I have large dogs but for some reason they like the small dry kibble and this is kibble is on the smaller side.<br /><br />I have also noticed a positive change in their stool.  It is a little firmer and a bit smaller, meaning they are absorbing more and eliminating less.<br /><br />I actually really liked Nature's Variety while they were eating it but so far I think the switch was a very good one.<br /><br />****PRICE INCREASE UPDATE: I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER THAT THE PRICE INCREASE EFFECTIVE IN THE PAST WEEK IS AN ISSUE AS THE PRICE FOR THIS FOOD HAS ESSENTIALLY DOUBLED.  I MAY BE WRONG BUT THIS APPEARS MORE OF AN AMAZON INCREASE AS MY BACKUP FOR BUYING THIS DOG FOOD IS PETCO AND THE 8 POUND BAG IS CURRENTLY SELLING FOR $10.42, ABOVE BIT ABOVE THE AMAZON PRICE INCREASE BUT WELL BELOW THE CURRENT $16 FOR AN 8 POUND BAG.  SINCE I LIKE THE FOOD (AND MY DOGS LIKE IT) I CAN JUST BUY IT THERE.

review/summary: Merrick delivers again
review/text: EDIT: Recent price increase DOUBLED!  Sadly I will have to seek an alternative now.<br /><br />We have been feeding our 10 month old pug Merrick food shortly after we got him.  He is still considered to be in the puppy stage, but Merrick discontinued Puppy Plate so we decided to start him on adult food a few months early.  I introduced it to him in a 50/50 mix for one weeks and there were no problems transitioning to the new food.  Merrick Whole earth Farms Adult dry dog food is grain based dog food with chicken and turkey being it's main sources of protein.  There are no real taboo ingredients in this mix and has turned out to be a great choice.  Compared to puppy plate his stools are equally firm, but slightly smaller, indicating better digestion.  Like another reviewer stated, our dog eats less now, and has held his weight and activity level.  Merrick please don't discontinue this one!

review/text: I'm not quite ready to fully switch my dog to this, but at this price you really need to give it a try. Our regular feed is Halo which costs around $3 per pound. It's totally worth the price if your dog has digestive issues or allergies, but sometimes I just can't budget a new bag. I use this in a mix with Halo and so far we haven't seen any sign of allergies (which is why we changed to Halo in the first place). If you feed your pets the store brand or mass market crud you're missing out on a crucial, easy way to maintain a healthy pet.

review/text: This popcorn is a little pricey, but it's worth it if you like cheese popcorn. It's easy to make, too. You pop the corn the same way you do any microwave popcorn. It already has some cheese on it when it comes out of the microwave, but it comes with a packet of additional cheese powder to sprinkle on. I just put the popped corn into a container with a lid, sprinkle on the extra cheese, put the lid on and shake it up. Of course, you get the orange fingers when you eat it, but that's the way with any cheese popcorn. It's "finger lickin' good," though.

These are five inches long, but they're basically the width of your finger. They're pretty skinny! Still, it's a great price for a snack. I give one every two or three days, but don't expect a stick to last more than 24 hours. If they're a hard chewer, expect 30 minutes.<br /><br />Remember it's not a good idea for your dog to consume large amounts of rawhide, as it can lead to impacted bowels. Just use them in moderation, especially since these are small, and you'll be fine.

review/summary: our dog rates this 5+ stars
review/text: Other rawhide chews sometimes gave our dog tummy trouble and so we have since switched to MADE IN USA products. Interesting reading: FDA pet food recall list.  Our dog loves these and they seem to digest well.  She's a big dog and will chew and eat these rawhides in a matter of 10-20 minutes, but we treat these as occasional snacks and not as a chew.  They leave no mess behind and we've never noticed any staining, but our dog doesn't eat these in a carpeted area.  She NEVER turns good buddy snacks down.

review/text: My puppy loves these but after a couple of weeks he developed a bald spot on his chest.  I'm not sure if its the chews are not. I will have to discontinue them until we find out what is wrong. He really likes them though.  He is also on the castor and Pollux puppy food, but had not developed the skin problem til after I gave him the rawhide.

review/summary: They arrived alive!!! I mean unbroken!
review/text: I have ordered Bonne Maman Preserves for well over a year from Amazon because the prices could not be beaten anywhere in my area.  The third order back arrived with the jars broken due to poor packing.  Ironically this order was not filled by Amazon but a different vendor.  Nevertheless Amazon promptly refunded my money.  I was a little hesitant about ordering again because of this (broken jars of preserves can be pretty messy)but when I realized that the order was filled by a vendor I had not used before not Amazon, I decided to order again. That order arrived with no problem and since then I have ordered again several times with no issues at all. Each of the glass jelly jars "arrived alive", carefully packed.  Of course the preserves and jelly are the best I have tasted rivaling "homemade" (which we used to do when we were younger and into canning several fruits and vegetables".  In my opinion I like the Raspberry and Blackberry preserves the best so usually I order the six packs of those specifically  j rather than the assortment.  I have to admit however when my granddaughter stays with us she is a huge fan of her "Poppie's"  special strawberry preserves and peanut butter sandwiches. I would recommend that when you order look closely at the vendor who will fulfill the order and go with Amazon.  Generally I look for the "This order ships free with..." and that offer will usually be fulfilled by Amazon.

review/summary: AMAZING!
review/text: We've been feeding this to our dog for several months now and I must say that he is getting around considerably easier!  We started in the fall and this winter was a bit easier for him, even in the hard cold.  This spring, he is moving more easily, even when I am not diligent on regular exercise.<br /><br />Riley is a Border Collie mix, male, 7 years old. Very active, healthy weight.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />10 months later and through the winter....<br />Riley has been on this food for well over a year now and hubby and I are quite shocked at the improvement.  We really only expected a minor improvement and perhaps to slow the progression but Riley doesn't do that very slow, labored rise from laying down.  Last winter, it would break my heart to see him trying to get up from his bed but now, he's like a puppy again, ready to go whenever we are!  We will be feeding this formula for as long as he'll eat it!  Thanks Pedigree!<br />Of course, no guarantees with your cherished member of the family, but considering the very expensive stuff that is out there - this is TOTALLY worth a try for 6-8 months!

review/summary: Creme de Pirouline-Dark Chocolate
review/text: You can't go wrong with these flavorful wafers for a snack.  They make many flavors, but these are the dark chocolate kind, which can make you feel healthy.  After all, dark chocolate is especially good for you with antioxidants and stuff, right?  Well, we'll at least pretend that they are. While these aren't the best cookie in the world, they are good enough to make you eat half a can in one sitting as I can attest to.<br /><br />They would be great dipped in milk but I don't even need that to start an eating binge. The filling is nice and creamy chocolate while the wafers are crunchy and go together fantastically.  I suppose they would go nice with coffee, but I don't like coffee so I can't attest to that.<br /><br />They come in a metal tin (recyclable!)that is sealed and has an additional sealed bag on the inside for freshness. The serving size suggests 2 sticks per serving and that comes to about 100 calories with 4g being the total fat.  Good news is, there's no trans fat in these. Ingredients include: wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oil (palm kernel oil, coconut oil, peanut oil), reduced fat cocoa powder, soy flour, malted barley flour, rice flour, cornstarch, whey (milk), soy lecithin, salt, vanilla, caramel color, natural flavors.  Allergy advisory is that this product contains wheat, soy, milk, and peanuts.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011

review/summary: Pike Place is smooth, bold and maybe overpriced
review/text: You cannot argue with the Starbucks success story and Pike Place follows that tradition. We brew about 24 cups per day for household use and found this roast competitive with other high-end offerings..smooth and somewhat bold.<br /><br />In the premium bean category, individual tastes seem to rule. At this price level, there are several other niche roasters offering 'as good or better' blends. It is difficult, given the somewhat artifical rise in bean prices, to clearly assess the quality/price point but all things considered, it might be slightly ($1) overpriced. But, if Pike's is your favorite, money isn't that important.  It certainly is worth a try.

review/summary: Starbucks Pike Place Roast
review/text: Everything it claims to be and the kind of coffee that will likely please the majority of coffee drinkers. I find that a coffee press is the best way to appreciate freshly ground quality coffee beans, but this is very good using an automatic drip maker as well. It has a well rounded full flavor, nice aroma and without being too acidic. The shipping was very prompt arriving two days earlier than the earliest estimated time of arrival. It came well packaged and the beans were of top quality freshness. "I only wish that I could afford it more often." I highly recommend giving this one a try.

review/summary: When it's good it's excellent! When it's not so good it's diner.
review/text: I buy Pike's place from my local Starbuck's and have them grind it for my french press. I can tell whether it will be a good pound of coffee by how aromatic the freshly ground coffee is on the way home. If my car is filled with the smell of freshly ground coffee I'm happy. I have had two separate pounds that were complete duds, no smell and no flavor --- very disappointing. Not sure how long a stretch between the the beans being roasted and packaged to being sold but at this price point I expect consistency.<br /><br />Pike Place is a strong full flavored coffee that my husband and I love in the morning. I get up and look forward to making a fresh pot of Pike's, and I don't mind paying for it. Three stars because of the inconsistency. If it was the same every time I purchased Pike Place then I'd rate 5 stars without hesitation.

review/text: It's a bit odd that this particular flavor of Salada green tea is even titled decaffeinated, but NO where on the actual box does it state that it is decaffeinated. Salada's website says their green teas are decaffeinated - but if so, why not state it on the box itself? Some of their flavored teas (eg, purple antioxidants) DO come with a decaffeinated label on the box. This one does not, whether purchased at Amazon or in my local supermarket.

review/summary: This product it not what you may think you are getting
review/text: I enjoyed my Manicardi #8 vinegar I bought in Italy. I thought I was buying and even better quality with this product as it is advertised as #12. I was able compare them side by side and this #12 is not close to the same good flavor. I did some research and found that it is actually a lower quality cleverly described by the manufacturer as a 3 barrel formally #12 to confuse the buyer. The description is correct per the manufacturer's label so I can't say that olio2go has a deceptive advertisement. It points out that it is actually "grape must" and a condiment quality. But including the #12 designation does mislead. So I gave it one star based on the easily confused product. It was not what I was expecting so I am unhappy with the result. Others may enjoy the flavor but the real thing is much better.

review/summary: Delicious healthy food!
review/text: I was a bit skeptical buying a tinned fish product that is flavored or spiced. My thinking is that it must be so nasty and foul that it NEEDS to be pre spiced?  I was proven wrong. You get a nice firm boneless fillet that is devoid of heads, entrails and the like that is common in sardines. The Omega 3 and 6 rich flesh is not overly fishy like many sardine products. Pepper and lemon are MADE for oily fish, truly a perfect pairing, mild but gives a bit of kick.  On a nice soda cracker, I would eat this over any canned tuna that is higher on the food chain and has notably higher mercury levels than these small tasty low food chain fishes. Herring fillets, tastier and healthier than tuna but not as fishy as whole sardines.

review/text: I'm now on a low sodium diet, and trying to find foods I can still eat.  I love sardines with crackers and cheese, so thought I'd give these Brunswick Lemon & Cracked Pepper Seafood Snacks a try.  At 220 mg of sodium per serving, it's pretty low compared to fish in mustard or hot sauce.  Pretty much what I expected from this...a nice lemon pepper fishy flavor.  Made a nice sandwich, would be great with crackers too.  I'm pretty much a cheapskate, so I don't spend more than $1-$2 a can for sardines or fish steaks.  The price was right for these as well!

review/text: This is the best of the Ocean Spray sugar free flavors, in my opinion.  Of course, one of my all-time favorite flavors is peach, so this fits the bill perfectly.  I usually make up a 32-oz Nalgene bottle of the stuff, using two of the sticks, and try to drink 2 or 3 bottles a day.  It's not overly sweet, and has a strong peach flavor that doesn't taste chemical or phony.<br /><br />Amazon's price varies, so keep an eye on it.  So far, it has stayed a little below what I would pay in the local market for this, and since I can have it delivered (and with Amazon Prime, I can get it fast), it's worth it to me to purchase in bulk like this.

review/summary: I drank this milkshake. I DRANK IT UP!
review/text: Whenever I finish a strenuous workout, the first thing I want to do is slam a cold, thick milkshake down my throat. There's nothing quite as refreshing as a creamy, sickly sweet, dairy-based beverage to cool you down after pushing your body to its breaking point. I've slammed can after can of this and felt like a Superman.<br /><br />But seriously, I think that's exactly what this drink is for. No, really? I'm supposed to devour a 370 calorie milkshake after every workout? I understand it contains a lot of protein, but at 370 calories, you might as well be eating liquid hamburger. Oh, I see this is also supposed to be a "meal replacement." Just don't let your kids drink these to the exclusion of actual food.<br /><br />The milkshake was alright, though. Honestly, it wasn't much more than a Carnation Instant Breakfast. It had that same taste and consistency. And despite its calories, it didn't fill me up at all. I guess that's what you get for drinking your calories. I probably wouldn't get it again.

review/text: At 300-some odd calories, Gatorade's new 'Nutrition Shake' works great as a meal replacement.

The drink is very tasty with none of that weird protein shake aftertaste.<br /><br />I think drinking these all the time could get a bit pricey, but I would definitely recommend them for people on a weight-lifting/workout regimen who are looking for an easy way to get some protein and as a meal replacement.
