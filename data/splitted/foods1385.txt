review/summary: Not bad, but regular Splenda is better.
review/text: This product does have a nice flavor. However, it is somewhat more granular than regular Splenda. Also, I don't think that I would it for baking purposes.<br /><br />Overall...not bad though.

review/summary: Sugar substitute made from fruit
review/text: I ordered this on a whim one day when browsing around the internet for a decent tasting sugar substitute that was a natural as possible with no aspartame or saccharin.<br /><br />After reading up and doing some research on Nectresse (which is from the makers of Splenda), I was pleased to discover that it is advertised as being 100% all natural as it's made from the extract of Monk Fruit.  Apparently, Monk Fruit use dates back to the 13th Century in which monks in China began to utilize it for its natural sweetness and its health benefits.<br /><br />With this in mind, I decided to order this on Amazon, and as soon as it arrived I decided to give it a try.  I must say that I'm impressed.  The taste is very similar to sugar and in my opinion leaves no bad aftertaste.<br /><br />So far I have only used this in coffee and tea, as a topping for fresh fruit, and on oatmeal and cereal, but I have only great things to say about it.<br /><br />According to the label, this has 0 calories, 0g of fat, and 2g of carbs per serving, and each packet provides the same sweetness as 2 teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />Will buy again!

review/summary: Have I Found THE ONE?
review/text: I've struggled for years to find the right sweetener. Just when I think I've found it, the negative reviews start to emerge about possible health problems. This happened first with Saccharin, Equal and then Splenda. I used Equal for years then switched to Splenda, which I like but of course the health concerns again. I don't enjoy Stevia at all, it has a bitter aftertaste that's very unpleasant. Xylitol can cause stomach upset, plus it's way too sweet for my taste.<br /><br />Today I discovered Nectresse and love it. It has the same consistency as sugar and dissolves easily. I hate the way Stevia sits on top of the surface of liquid and takes many stirs to dissolve.<br /><br />I used two packets of Nectresse in a cup of tea and it was perfect, just as sweet as Splenda but without the powdery feel.<br /><br />MY only concern is the cost, loose Nectresse comes in a small 5.9 oz canister. That doesn't seem like enough to cook with and the price is around seven dollars.<br /><br />I may have to continue to use Splenda for larger recipes, since it's more cost effective. If the company offers a bigger canister or package of loose Nectresse in the future then I would consider switching from Splenda permanently.<br /><br />I will definitely buy this product again. Finally I might have found THE ONE!!

review/summary: Pretty good, but I still prefer Stevia
review/text: In the last year I've switched from saccharine, NutraSweet and Splenda to more natural, low-carb or no-carb sweeteners.  I've read too many bad things about the artificial ones, and my low-carb diet doesn't allow sugar, honey or agave nectar.  I'm in love with liquid stevia, because it works equally well in hot or cold beverages, and also bakes well.  It's somewhat expensive, but I feel confident that it's not poisoning me.<br /><br />Nectresse Natural No-Calorie Sweetener is a close second to Stevia in my personal preferences.  I found it to be easy to use in measured packets, and has a similar consistency to table sugar.  It sweetens well, although I thought it had a strange aftertaste (but some people say the same thing about Stevia).  It's also less expensive per serving than Stevia.<br /><br />I will probably look for this product again, when my box is empty.  It's nice to have  several options for natural non-caloric sweeteners.  But I still prefer Stevia.

I've tried plain stevia and the ones that are a blend of stevia with other sweeteners, and I still can't get past the aftertaste. I've been buying "Ideal" but it's still not "all natural".<br /><br />Nectresse is just what I've been looking for. I do need 1 1/2 packets to feel the sweetness in my coffee, but that's not a problem for me.  I only wish it would come in 100-count, instead of 40.

review/summary: How Sweet It Is
review/text: There are several things I like about this new sweetener: zero calories, zero fat and only two grams of carbs per 1 packet serving. I also like that it's "100% natural," and that it definitely does sweeten whatever I add it to. But for me (and this may not apply to ALL tasters) there is a slight taste that is hard to identify. Not exactly a bitter aftertaste but a taste I'm not used to associating with sugar. Whatever the nectresse taste is, I'm not crazy about it; but I will say this -- it doesn't last long, and the sweetness does last.

review/summary: worst aftertaste of all sugar substitutes
review/text: My primary application for sweeeteners is in Iced Tea.  Though I don't like the tea-flavored syrup served in some southern states (and now spreading), I do like a moderate level of sweet in my iced tea.  My personal opinion is that all sugar substitutes so far (saccarine, aspartame, sucralose, stevia, nectresse) have bad enough aftertastes to make any of them unacceptable.<br /><br />However, In the interests of calorie-reduction I have experimented with mixtures of sugar and the pretenders.  I can tolerate blends of sugar with aspartame or sucralose with approximately 50% of the sweet coming from sugar.  Aspartame seems to work best, with the sugar eliminating the aspartame's aftertaste.  With sucralose a touch of the chlorinated solvent aftertase still leaks through. ( Note, I think the soda companies have made the same discovey.  Pepsi Next and Dr. Pepper 10 are both mixes)<br /><br />I just tried Nectresse and the bitter, metallic aftertaste was not improved, and may have been amplified, by the mix with sugar.  Nectresse is definitly off my shopping list.  But try it for yourself, because everyone's taste varies.  Some people even like brussel sprouts!?!

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: The ingredients of this sweetener are as follows:  Erythritol, Sugar, Monk Fruit Extract, Molasses.  Erythritol is a sugar alcohol that can occur naturally.  So that makes this sweetener "100% Natural," as emblazoned on the box.  The problem is, I detect a distinctly chemical aftertaste.  It could be the molasses, but it tastes more chemical than molasses to me.<br /><br />I am not such a purist about my artificial sweeteners.  But I do expect them to taste like sugar - and one would think, with sugar being the second ingredient, this one would have an advantage.  Not so.  (Don't get me started on the "Made from Monk Fruit" labeling.  When it is the 3rd of 4 ingredients?  And what does a monk fruit look like anyway?  Or taste like?  Does it taste like Nectresse?)<br /><br />My favorite sweetener is Splenda Essentials with B vitamins.  Nectresse is also made by Splenda.  It has a sugarlike consistency and dissolves easily in my coffee.  However, as artificial sweeteners go, it is my least favorite.  I might actually forego sweetener if this were the only one available.

review/summary: I smell a gimmick
review/text: Though this product is pitched as being made from monk fruit nectar, its primary ingredient is Erythriol, a semi-sweet sugar alcohol that has been around for a long time and is nothing new. This is just another marketing gimmick to spin off a new zero-calorie sweetener under a different label. It is a ruse not based on predominance of monk fruit sweetness which is comprised mainly of fructose and mogrosides. You could get something very similar tasting if you mixed Stevia with Erythriol, but I guess they can't do that because that's already been patented as another product sold as Truvia. My guess is all they have left is a product that combines Thaumatin with Erythriol and call it something else.

I have waited for a long time for these companies that make artificial sweetners that can potentally be dangerous to us to come up with something healthier that does not cause tumors and things in humans. I wanted something safer.  This new one  is made with monk fruit and lists real sugar in the ingredients as well,  which I was surprised by.  Also, it taste okay but not as good as some of the Stevia products.  I will wait until they come out with something better before switching from pure via and other natural sweetners made with stevia. This simply does not tase good enough for me to use regularly.

review/text: From a taste perspective, your dog will probably love this product; however, I do not recommend that you buy it for your dog.  As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them.

review/summary: worth every penny!
review/text: This product is absolutely amazing. I bought this deodorant in July, at the worst of the sweating/body odor season. Any deodorant I bought wasn't working (my issue was body odor, not really sweating as much), and it was getting to be so frustrating. I did a lot of research before buying this (mainly trusting reviews from various internet sites), because I couldn't justify spending so much money on a product that might not work. Well, I am certainly thankful for all of those reviews of it. I can't adequately express how happy I am with this deodorant. To say it is "life changing" might seem a little dramatic, but I truly think it has been. I am no longer self-conscious, I feel comfortable with myself throughout the entire day, and it just makes me feel so much better about myself. It does not have a strong smell during the day, which I really like. I don't walk around smelling like "cotton" or "lavender" or whatever else I've been forced to smell like for the past many years. I just smell like me.<br /><br />I have waited this long to review the product because sometimes my deodorants work for a week or two, but then stop altogether. But I can safely say that I have been using Clinical Protection (Motion Sense) for four months now, and I have not once been unhappy with the results.<br /><br />The most important thing, though, is to USE IT AS DIRECTED!! You HAVE TO apply it at night, and just at night!! It took me a few days to get used to, and once in a while when I'm tired I forget, but if you follow the directions (two clicks to each underarm, AT NIGHT), you will be amazed with the results. I carried regular deodorant with me for the first few days because I was afraid I might start smelling mid-day, but I did not once have to use it.<br /><br />I would recommend this deodorant to anybody! I rarely, rarely review products online, but I am so happy with this deodorant that I felt the need to spread it's wonder with everybody else.<br /><br />Good luck! If you buy it, you will not be disappointed!

I will say this, if you follow the directions and apply the product at night you will be amazed the next day. However, if you throw caution to the wind and put it on in the morning expecting it to work as it should, you will be terribly disappointed. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is simply because it made me have to change my routine a bit, which is a little tough to get used to. Otherwise, this is a great product!

I do have a problem with the price - I can buy a 9 oz. can for 2.99 at my dollar store, so even two cans amounting to 18 oz. will still not cost as much as this one 16 oz package. I guess they have to get their shipping costs in SOME where, but to me, that should be a perk of being a Prime member. Prices not so high as to infer that they are sneaking the shipping cost into the bottom line. This is not always so, though - many times amazon's cost is very competitive - And I LOVE the two day shipping. Instant grat!

review/text: I can go into any store that sells candy and find everything that they have in the 90s crate and it would cost MAYBE $10 and get a nice REUSABLE basket to put it in from the thrift shop. They don't even have Crybabies or Warheads or Bubble Tape!!!!! RIP OFF!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Sugar Rush
review/text: Opening the box gives a sensory sugar rush!  It would have been difficult to collect all the different candies represented in this collection, so you can justify the cost.  I got it for my son to remind him of his childhood favorties.  It is a fun gift for the drug store candy lover.

review/summary: Okay ....
review/text: I wouldn't give this as a gift, the amount of candy is kind of pitiful, it's like, &lt; $10 worth, and the box is mostly stuffed with paper space-fillers. There are several full-sized candies and then a handful of jolly ranchers, fireballs, bazooka gums, etc. Perhaps use it as a base and then put some more candy in it before gifting it.<br /><br />As others have said, none of the candy is particularly "90's" - it's all stuff that is still sold today.<br /><br />Basically, cute idea, poor execution.

I am a huge candy freak, and this box had all of my favorites: apple heads, pop rocks, airheads, nerds, blow pops, you name it. It came packaged well, and was such a fun surprise when I opened it and dug through all of the candy inside. I loved it so much that I just ordered another one for myself! I think this makes a great gift, especially for people who you know just absolutely LOVE candy. 5 stars!

review/summary: Best and finest tequila to date
review/text: There's no much to say - If you want to taste the best Tequila Mexico has ever produced, buy this bottle.<br /><br />If you think you have tasted Tequila because you tried one like "Tequila Jose Cuervo Especial", let me start by telling you that's simply the worst Tequila flavor I have ever tasted. It doesn't even taste like real Tequila - I don't even know what that thing is, but I definitely hate it and it causes me the worst hangovers.<br /><br />Tequila Herradura is one of the best Tequila producing houses in Tequila Jalisco (the best one in my opinion), and this one (Herradura Selecci&oacute;n Suprema) is to Tequila like Cognac is to wine. It has a lot of body and an extremely good flavor. While it's strong, it doesn't burn like plain alcohol. It just brings Tequila heaven to your mouth.<br /><br />Don't use it for Margaritas, with lemon or any mix for that matter. That's just as bad as mixing a good Cognac with Coke. Taste it alone and slowly if you want to have the right experience.<br /><br />TIP on buying Tequila: Always check that the bottle says this (no exception!):<br /><br />1) 100% Agave.<br />2) Made in Tequila, Jalisco.

review/summary: WOW. It certainly works!
review/text: I'm drinking this stuff as I write this, and have been for several weeks. My business involves me working some very long hours, often late into the night, and it's all thanks to my Sodastream Energy that I survive.<br /><br />Bear in mind it's HIGHLY CONCENTRATED. No kidding around. Even just licking the drips from the neck of the bottle is enough to give me a buzz. When I was first trying this, I didn't realize that it's more concentrated than regular Sodastream syrups and so much less syrup is needed per unit of water. So I mixed it with some seltzer water in the same quantity I would any Sodastream mix.<br /><br />Whew. It made me all jittery and I swear it gave me heart palpitations -- and mind you I'm a perfectly healthy and fit 23 year-old male.<br /><br />DO NOT drink any of this stuff undiluted because it will, no joke, kill you.<br /><br />That said, it tastes just like Red Bull (maybe even better!) and by no means do you need a Sodastream machine to use it. I just mix it with cans of seltzer water from the supermarket or even regular uncarbonated tap water, and it's great.

review/summary: Superior taste and nutrition among the puffed cereals
review/text: I have enjoyed standard puffed wheat for more than 30 years. This puffed Kamut performs similarly but is superior in taste and texture. I find it delicious and a favorite of my young grandchildren. Longer grains and somewhat more chewey than standard puffed wheat, this product ranks especially high for a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Very satisfied with the product and find the pricing here provides a substantial savings over even supermarket prices.

review/summary: Excellent alternative to Cheerios for your baby
review/text: I bought this as an alternative to Cheerios for my baby when he started learning how to eat finger foods.  In my quest for the Cheerio alternative, even the organic cereals had ingredients (ie sugar, salt) that I didn't want to feed my son.  Just because something is organic, doesn't mean it's healthy.<br /><br />I like this because it's minimally processed.  It has one ingredient: Kamut. No sugar or anything else.  It's organic and just the right size for him to pick up with his fingers.  I can feel good feeding this to my son.<br /><br />I've tried it and I like it, too!

review/summary: Good substitute for Puffed Wheat
review/text: I'm a big fan of puffed wheat because it's very Weight Watcher friendly.  I usually buy the Arrowhead Mills Puffed Wheat from Amazon (link below), but alas, it was out of stock!! So I bought this as an alternative in the meantime.  The label describes it as The "Great Grandfather of Grains", being a close relative of wheat.<br /><br />The taste is pretty much the same as puffed wheat, maybe not as sweet,  but the puffs are much bigger, and more elongated.  Also a little different in color - slightly darker.<br /><br />My favorite is still puffed wheat, but this gets an "A" from me for a suitable alternative.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVNWSW">Arrowhead Mills Puffed Wheat Cereal, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Last 3 cases have been stale
review/text: I purchased the cases of this cereal because it is organic, it fills me up, and due to the nose dive recognized within the U.S. economy over the past four years, I am no longer able to afford much.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the last three cases I have ordered via Amazon have been stale.  I contemplated leaving this feedback because I am just thankful to have anything to eat.  However, after three cases of stale cereal that leaves an after taste due to the stale quality, I am having a difficult time stomaching this cereal anymore.<br /><br />For a couple more dollars, which I really did now wish to spend, but I am going to try to do so now, I have found that Nature's Path Kamut Puffs are "by far" extremely fresh in comparison.  It may be the Eco-bag that Nature's Path packages their cereal in, verses the softer plastic that Arrowhead packages their cereal in.  Not sure.

review/summary: Organic puffed kamut at a great price
review/text: Excellent quality, and a very good price... especially if you have an Amazon.com Prime membership and get free two day shipping. The price is quite a bit better than those in our local health food stores and supermarkets. Arrowhead Mills is a premium brand in organic grains, and their puffed Kamut is an excellent product.  While you do have to buy a dozen six ounce bags to get the best deal, the two of us don't seem to have any difficulty using it up in a reasonable time period... the cereal is really good.<br />As a vegetarian I appreciate having a source of top quality cereal grains at reasonable prices (we buy Arrowhead  puffed rice through Amazon.com as well).  I try to keep the amount of modern day wheat to a reasonable level in my diet, and find that Puffed kamut provides a similar flavor, without the concerns some experts have about wheat. In addition puffed kamut tastes great with fresh fruit, soy milk, and a light drizzle of honey.<br /><br />We also like having it delivered right to our door for less than two-thirds of what we'd pay for the Kamut alone in our local health food store. Less trips to shop, less stores to make the rounds of when we do go out, less things to lug home, and a noticeably lower price... what's not to like?

review/text: What nicer thing to hear than your best friend telling you that his husband blurted this out with a big smile when they opened the package I sent them for their anniversary!<br />  I had decided only days before I placed the order that I wanted to give them a bonsai tree if I could possibly afford it.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how reasonable this tree was, but admit I was worried: could it possibly be as lovely as the picture?<br />  It was! The lovely juniper bonsai was almost an exact duplicate of the online image, with the same graceful lines and attractive traditional bonsai bowl.<br />And although there was no option to enclose a gift card when I checked out (which is something I suggest the seller correct) I sent an email asking if a gift note with my specific wording could be added.  The seller did so: accurately written and at no charge.<br />  In addition, my friends received their gift at the very earliest date within the window of time projected.<br />  A wonderful gift at good price; delivered with better service than I could have expected.<br />  What more could you ask for?

review/summary: Awesome Bonsai Tree
review/text: I bought this bonsai tree as a Christmas gift for my dad, a total bonsai nut. It arrived in the mail in absolutely healthy condition - no brown, all in tact. It looks exactly like the picture! It looks so neat, I wanted to go order one for myself but now they are currently unavailable. Once they are available again, I definitely plan on purchasing it and to anyone debating purchasing it: do it. You will not be sorry.

review/summary: High Quality and Adorable Tree
review/text: I just received my tree, and it is very similar to the one pictured. The tree made it through the USPS (Priority Mail) intact and looking quite healthy.<br /><br />The seller watered the plant just before packaging, sealed over the soil / base of the tree with plastic, and packaged the bowl and tree securely in a specially sized box. They also provided a guide for caring for my juniper bonsai and a small amount of fertilizer to be applied every 2-3 weeks. They really couldn't have done more to ensure my tree is and will remain healthy and beautiful.<br /><br />They left the tree quite bushy and the trunk has a nice shape, so with a little trimming I'll have the perfect tree.<br /><br />I hope it'll have a long and happy life on my desk for years! I'll update later with continuing status.<br /><br />Great product!<br /><br />EDIT: The branches of the tree were all curved up and the foliage's shape didn't look as great as I'd like it when the tree arrived. However, the branches lowered into much better positions in a few days. Now the tree looks gorgeous, and I'm not sure I'll trim it at all! It was the secure packaging that caused the branches to look mooshed, so wait a few days before you decide upon a foliage verdict (or begin trimming).<br /><br />I forgot to mention before, the tree is planted in a sandy soil to ensure optimal drainage. I water every 4-5 days by immersing the lower half of the bowl in water for 15 minutes.

review/summary: Had Fun Re-styling the Tree
review/text: I bought one of these for my dad for his birthday and he loved it.<br /><br />I also bought one for myself and my son to enjoy as we explore bonsai as a new hobby. The tree arrived safely and was vigorous and healthy. It is styled just like the Amazon picture, in a dense bushy head of foliage.<br /><br />I decided to re-style it. So I pruned and wired it into a more dynamic shape. It ended up in a striking diagonal, with nice movement in the branches and nice bushy foliage pads on each one. I think it came out great.  I like it even more this way than in its original styling.

review/summary: A bit smaller than I expected
review/text: The bonsai tree shipped to me was rather small. However, I don't have much experience with bonsai trees so I wouldn't be able to tell you if the tree is too small to be 5+ years old. The bowl it came in is nice, but does not have as ornate of a design as depicted in the picture, but the seller did state that bowls would vary. I will say this for them though, I was debating whether or not to order the tree for my father for Christmas; I thought that he would like it, but according the shipping tables, the tree would not arrive before Christmas. I contacted the seller about this and they offered me a free upgrade first class.

review/text: Nice looking tree that came well protected against shipping damage. Unfortunately, it didn't last and died after a month; it was a gift that was sent with not one, but two books on how to look after bonsai trees! I am no horticulturalist, so I really cannot determine the cause of death, but it seems these trees are not as sturdy as some other plants and trees. Next time I will send a cactus; can't go wrong there!

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: My 14 year old cat wasn't eating, had to have a tooth pulled, and was generally miserable.  He's always been thin and a picky eater.  After the tooth was pulled, he was interested in food, but wouldn't eat.  I had to squirt it in his mouth a few times before he got the idea I wasn't going to give up.  Once he started drinking it, he loved it and began asking for it.  His coat is thicker and doesn't fall out as much.  He's put on weight, and even if he's having a 'sick day' from hair balls, he can drink this without throwing up the rest of the day.  He's so much happier and plays more.  Now even if there's a day when he isn't interested in food, I don't worry as much because he's so much healthier now.  Thank You !!

review/summary: Didn't work for me.
review/text: Bought this for a very sick cat whom I've been force-feeding for two weeks. She has thyroid cancer and can't swallow regular food, and I was hoping she would be able to lap it up, since she still drinks water. She would not drink it, so after reading a couple of reviews here I tried force-feeding her some. She vomited it back up within a couple of minutes (she doesn't vomit the other food).<br /><br />For comparison, I tried giving it to my healthy cat who loves everything. She wouldn't touch it, and when I rubbed some on her nose to give her a taste, she shied away from the saucer I set in front of her.<br /><br />I looked for an expiration date on the can, but found none, so I can't tell if it could be spoiled. It doesn't smell spoilied. Worst, I got this at PetCo, and paid $10 for a single can. So, neither cat liked it, and my sick cat couldn't keep it down. From other reviews, it looks like results vary.

review/summary: item is ok but not great
review/text: This item was a bit of a disappointment. I expected better flavor. It has a sour start but that is it. The cherry and soda flavor is very faint and difficult to taste. The texture is what you would expect from a quality gummy, soft and slightly firm but chewy. The sour is spot on, it will make you pucker.  e.frutti normally has wonderful products with abundant flavor, sadly this product was not one of them. I ordered 4 bags (8.8 pounds), opened one and ate a few and gave the three remaining bags away to less discriminate gummy consumers. I rated this product low because I expected better flavor and not just sour gummy. If you enjoy sour and are less concerned with flavor, this product may be right for you.

review/summary: Saving the life of a tot with severe multiple food allergies
review/text: My little one was 14 months and below the 3rd percentile.  I nursed him and strictly limited my diet to accomodate his severe allergies to dairy, soy, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, corn etc.  The time came where I just couldn't handle the limited diet any longer (and cooking of 3 separate meals for he and I, a vegetarian husband, and three other kids all three times a day).  So I decided to wean.  My little guy couldn't have many of the rice milks which were devoid of protein and all the formulas (even the terrible poisonous Neocate) had something he couldn't have. Then I found Toddler Health--a God send!!!  The taste is honestly strange and pretty repulsive at times (he refuses it as a drink) but I'm able to get him to eat half a scoop of it in a bowl of oatmeal daily mixed in rice milk and homemade oat cakes as well.  Finally because of this formula, my little guy is slowly starting to catch up.  I bought the rice one and plan on getting the oat too in the near future.

review/summary: Smooth as silk
review/text: I just found Starbucks Kcups in Bed/Bath/Beyond (also in Target) and of course I had to grab them on the spot!  I tried the House Blend and, unlike other Starbucks flavors, this is very smooth and not at all bitter or "burnt" like the Pike Place blend.  This flavor didn't require nearly as much sweetening and, since it isn't overly strong, it's perfect for use any time of day.  I bought a box of 16 for $11.99 - ($14.99 less the typical Bed/Bath/Beyond 20% discount).  I can't even begin to comprehend Amazon's pricing on this item.....or most other Kcups for that matter.  These kcups will be even more readily available nationwide than Dunkin' Donuts kcups so why the ridiculous pricing, Amazon??!!  Starbucks kcups (10-count) are also available in Von's (Safeway) supermarkets.

review/summary: Better than most!
review/text: Here's the deal with K Cups: they will always taste slightly different than regular brewed coffee.  The reason is with brewed coffee, you can control the strength of the brew, both with how you grind your beans and your water-to-coffee ratio.  With K Cups, the only control you have is how large or small a cup you choose to brew. Larger obviously is weaker, smaller is stronger.<br /><br />I have these K cups.  They are better than many of the others I have tried.  Again, it won't taste EXACTLY like a cup of Starbucks brewed coffee, but is pretty close.  I definitely recommend this over many others.<br /><br />Now, if we could just find them cheaper!

I'm a newbee when it comes to coffee as I just got a Keurig and am trying all different flavor's and blends. Out of all the ones I've tried, I like this one the least.

review/text: Very smooth but also bold on flavor, and no bitterness.  I like this better than Caribou which is also a very nice k-cup coffee. The Starbucks has more flavor than Caribou but pulls it off without turning you off. I brew this Starbucks House Blend on MEDIUM size (8 oz), which works out for my taste when a little creamer (real) is added.  I can't say that it tastes like the Starbucks House Blend you get inside a real Starbucks because I have never tried the house blend inside a Starbucks.  But as k-cups go, this is a pleasant blend with just the right amount of strength (for me) and no bitter aftertaste.  I only gave 4 stars because the price is higher than most other k-cups, otherwise this is a fine coffee.

review/summary: Fairly Bold - Recommended
review/text: This Starbucks House Blend K-Cup is a bolder coffee than expected that tastes every bit as good as the in-store brew. We typically drink the much more affordable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, but occasionally like to try other types. This Starbucks coffee is a little better tasting but it is a too expensive when drinking 4-5 cups a day.<br /><br />Recommended for the flavor (4 stars) but not at the retail price (3 stars).<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Great product - Great Amazon price
review/text: I have been a Starbucks afficianado for years and am a recent user of the Keurig system (from Amazon - gift that I thought I would never want!), which I have become very pleased with.  However, the K-cups can seem a little pricey so I was using the Solofill cups (from Amazon) and using my own coffee, but the price of this particular Starbucks House Blend was irresistible, so now I use both. The Keurig system is quick and efficient and now I am even happier with it than before.

review/summary: Very smooth but solid flavor, a great all around coffee
review/text: Everyone has different tastes, and I like to mix it up too. After trying many brands and blends for half a year, I have determined that this is my daily drinker, el numero-uno.<br /><br />The closest I can compare it to is perhaps the Caribou Blend, only this is a tad smoother yet somehow richer, and has zero bitterness, and zero aftertaste or chemical taste.  I brew it on the medium (8 oz) setting for what it's worth, but it is probably great stronger or lighter.  This Starbucks blend is very friendly for all drinkers, lightens easily with a little half & half, and so it is my go to for hosting parties.  It is definitely a good way to experience the best of your Keurig!

review/summary: One of the Tastiest of the K-Cups
review/text: Keurig has, for better or worse, pushed the coffee market in a strange direction.  Convenience is championed over quality.  Luckily, Starbucks' House Blend K-Cups are just as good as the bean versions of the coffee that you can purchase in stores.  Out of the blends that I have tried, the House Blend seem to be the most balanced: it's not too acidic, not too bitter, not too bland.  It's just right.  I would recommend this coffee to both coffee novices and coffee experts.<br /><br />With that said, I would recommend comparing prices off Amazon before buying these here.  The prices seem to fluctuate (as they do in other stores as well).

review/summary: Praise cheeses!
review/text: I absolutely love my Keurig. But every now and then I found myself getting bored with the selection of K-Cups. I resorted to buying a reusable K-Cup and filling it with freshly ground beans from Starbucks. The results were less than desirable. I would never get the mesaurements right and I would end up having to make a trip to get coffee.<br />These K-Cups from starbucks are a godsend! the price is not bad. The ratio of coffee grounds to water is the same every time so my coffee comes out great. I am a happy person once again! I also love the house blend because even though it says its a lighter blend, its starbucks. Its roasted darker than most. So if you are a strong coffee lover i think the house blend will suit you just fine.

review/summary: favorite K cup
review/text: I enjoy Starbucks coffee and this K-cup is no exception but like Starbucks coffee shops, the price is a little extravagant for what you get. Then again, I find that the nature of using k-cups is a guilty pleasure.

review/text: This is my favorite coffee.  When I make it at home using the Kcups, it tastes just like what I get at a Starbucks coffee shop.  I love that I can purchase these cups on Amazon and get my "fix" in two days.
