review/summary: Not the same very disappointed Chihuahua
review/text: These treats were my dogs favorite but the company has changed the formula Now, instead of duck wrap we have duck paint with some bits floating about. A rip off and misleading. My dog rejected this product and will not go near the treat.

review/summary: These are NOT wrapped in chicken anymore!
review/text: This product has changed from the original that my dogs loved. These are NOT wrapped in chicken as the packaging and product description will have you believe. This is my 2nd attempt to get the old product without success. Evidently, these have replaced the quality product we used to receive. When I opened them I discovered these flimsy strips of rawhide that are now painted with this mystery substance. The rawhide is like very thin cardboard. There is absolutely NO chicken on these. I contacted Beefeaters and they have not responded. This company is advertising falsely and making a huge profit on this garbage!! Save your money and start looking for a new product. My dogs would not touch these!! I will not be purchasing anything made by this company again. They raised the prices on these too, while replacing quality with crap. So disappointing!

review/summary: Orange and dark chocolate...yum...
review/text: One of my favorite flavor combinations is orange and dark chocolate. I saw these on my grocery store shelf one day & decided to give them a try.  I wasn't totally sure of what I was getting. The word 'biscuit' confused me, but I'd heard that the British use that word for cookie.  The biscuit is more of a soft cookie about 1/4" thick; it's topped with a stiff orange jelly & iced with a thin layer of dark chocolate icing. One of these cookies will satisfy my craving. I tried the raspberry flavor, but prefer the orange.<br /><br />Serving Size: 2<br />Servings per 5.29 oz Container: 6<br />Calories: 100<br />Total Fat: 3 g<br />~Saturated Fat: 1.5g<br />~Trans Fat: 0<br />Cholesterol: 10mg<br />Sodium: 35mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 17 g<br />Dietary Fiber: 0<br />Sugars: 14g<br />Protein: &lt;1g<br /><br />Ingredients listed on product page under Important Information<br />Made in Belgium

review/summary: Great little dessert cookie, or "chocolate and orange, together at last"
review/text: My late father's favorite flavor combination was orange and chocolate. His confection of choice was candied orange peel covered in dark chocolate. When he passed away in his 80's we found a small stash of chocolate-covered orange jellies in the cupboard--his treat. He'd have LOVED this cookies. They are soft sponge biscuits with a layer of stiff orange jelly and a brittle dark chocolate topping. The combination is delectable--the soft biscuit, orangey jelly and the crackle of the bitter chocolate on top. A few of these make a great dessert with a cup of espresso. They come in raspberry flavor as well, which I tried and it's also absolutely terrific. So keep a tube of these on hand and if required to produce a dessert or afternoon refreshment for a sudden visitor, make a cup of coffee and put a few of these on a nice paper doily. Done.

review/summary: I've loved them since i was a child
review/text: I've been eating these Belgian cookies since i was a child growing up in Belgium.  They're a very old cookie called Couques de Bastogne (Bastogne cookies, from the town where the Battle of the Bulge took place). They were first marketed in the U.S. under that name but since that didn't mean  much to Americans the name's been changed several times over the 20 or so years I've seen them around. My local grocery store (I live in the Rockies) was carrying them, then Nabisco took over the LU brand and quit carrying the Bastogne here.  I just bought several boxes in NYC at a deli next to Time Square and really wanted more.  So happy to have found them on Amazon.<br /><br />They're a bit sweet, that's true, and that is a bit unusual for a European cookie but they make the best dunking cookie: cold milk, coffee of hot chocolate. They're similar to the the Lotus cinnamon cookie also made in Belgium that Delta serves on its flights. sorry the name escapes me.  I prefer the texture of the Cinnamon Sugar Spice; it's lighter.

review/summary: Buy Them Off the Shelf
review/text: For years, the only Lu's I could find at my local market were the USA Lu's, which aren't as good as the Belgium biscuits.  So, I was happy to find them at Amazon this past July, 2012 and bought the case of six boxes.  Unfortunately, they didn't taste fresh and had an expiration date of Dec. 2012; that explained the stale taste, but I chose not to return them.  Instead, I nuke two in the microwave for 5 or 6 seconds and it sort of revives the flavor.<br /><br />Well, last week, Sept. 14, 2012, I found the Belgium Lu at my local supermarket and bought a single box.  That box expires Dec. 2013, over a year from now, and the cookies definitely taste better.  Moral of the story: Buy them where you can read the Expiration date.  I surmise that having a year or two shelf life should be about right.

review/summary: PIMS ORANGE
review/text: This is the second (and last) time in a few years that I buy Pim's Orange from Amazon. Like the first time, I was disappointed, not because of the cookie itself, which is normally delicious--as a French person, I am very familiar with PIM'S cookies and know what they should taste and look like--, but because of the improper manner in which the packages are stored and handled along the way (I cannot figure out at which end). Obviously, the packages go from cold to hot temperatures (or vice versa), possibly multiple times, which is the worst thing that can happen to cookies incorporating chocolate and filling: this alters their appearance and consistency--chocolate surface becomes discolored and collapses due to melting before regaining some firmness, and the cookie part and filling become too soft. The taste is not affected too badly, but you cannot serve them to guests, because of the cookies' miserable appearence.  In order to save them anyway for my own consumption, I wrap the individual packs in a bath towel and store them in the vegetable compartment of my refrigerator. That helps regain some firmness in the cookies, but of course the chocolate surface remains discolored. So my advice is:  buy individual packs at your grocery store if they carry PIM'S, because the cookies are normally delicious, but do not buy them from Amazon.  It's too bad that Amazon has done nothing so far to correct this storage problem. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, to my satisfaction 99 p.100 of the time, including LU "Petit Beurre" cookies (these are rarely available in US grocery stores). Since they include no chocolate or filling, the shipments are usually in perfect condition.  I give PIM,S Orange three stars because the product is excellent under normal conditions, and the problem is not caused by the manufacturer.

review/summary: Not really a biscuit/cookie
review/text: These "soft biscuits" are less like biscuits/cookies and more like really really dense cake. It was quite a surprise when I first tried one because I was expecting something similar to the soft cookies you buy in the grocery store. Never the less, the taste is very good with the raspberry filling being nicely complemented by the dark chocolate.<br /><br />The flavor is nice but the cookie part was too odd for me so I won't be buying this again. Still, I think there are probably a lot of people who would enjoy this product and if you like raspberry and dark chocolate you may want to give it a try.

review/text: These shortbread cookies are amazing. They are made of only 4 simple ingredients (wheat flour, butter, sugar, and salt), and they taste heavenly. If you made these cookies yourself, at home, you would use the same ingredients. There is nothing artificial added.<br /><br />Besides all of that, they are crispy, very satisfying and not too sweet. My grandchildren love them as much as I do. If you like shortbread, you will love these cookies. If you haven't tried shortbread cookies, I suggest you give these a try and start with the best, right from the Scottish Highlands.

I had these on subscribe and save and was ordering about 3 cases a month.  My husband is English and we drink a lot of tea in this house and there is seriously no better tea cookie.  These cookies are pretty good dry, but dunked in a hot cup of milky tea they are total heaven.  Since Amazon isn't carrying them anymore I am going to have to figure out another way to get my fix.

review/summary: shipping concern
review/text: Aptamil formula is a fantistic food for my 3-months old baby. When I came to USA 2 month ago, I couldn't find this formula in any supermarket in the USA. So, I fed my baby an enfamil and a similac. My baby began to have green stool (before feeding enfamil or similac, he ate aptamil and pooed in 'yellow' collar and it is a signal of good health). I ordered 12 Aptails and my baby is now defecating in yellow color again and I'm so happy with that.<br /><br />The only reason that I gave 4 stars to this product is because of it's bad shipping.<br />It was delivered wrapped with only a layer of low qulity aircap and it was no wonder the formula can got torn and the powder was escaped in air transport which treat shipments carelessly.

review/text: I have used aptamil for three children. In my opinion, it is superior to anything I could find here in the US in the general market. The Europeans seem to be more restrictive as to additives and requiring more organic ingredients (not to mention the wierdness of giving a baby something 'flavored' as we see in other formulas). We tried Similac but it didn't agree with the youngest child. The seller was smart about the shipping labelling and we received it quicker than the estimated time from the UK.

review/text: This is my first review here on Amazon and I felt I needed to post after reading the other reviews on here and trying the product. The other reviews aren't valuable at all and don't say anything about the flavor...which is not to my liking. I tried this product on some beef fajitas and it was far from what I expected. It is very sweet. I was expecting soemthing that was spicy...not hot...but spicy as I would expect on traditional Mexcian food. At first the sweetness was not bad but not good but the more I ate the more it wore on me and in the end is just not good and too sweet. If you like sweet Fajita mix then this is for you. I hope this helps.

review/text: I found this Fajita sauce and the related Chimichurri sauce at a local Global Foods mart, but after using the bottles up, my wife recycled them and I had forgotten the brand name.  So I spent the next 6 months looking for them ever time we went grocery shopping - apparently the local mart stopped carrying them.  Needless to say, I bought lots of Chimichurri sauce brands - most of which were not nearly as delicious as I recalled this brand to be - until on a whim I looked up "chimichurri" here on Amazon.  Needless to say, as soon as I saw the World Harbors label, I recognized the brand again! :-)<br /><br />Anyway, whenever I make burritos or tacos, I add either the chimichurri or fajita sauce and my family & guests now think I should go into the restaurant business! :-P

I marinade my chicken in it for the best fajitas ever, plus I put in extra while it's cooking and pour some over my sour cream for an extra kick. It works great in taco bakes also. I've tried lots of fajita/taco sauces but none can compare with World Harbors. I'd be so lost without it.

review/summary: ONE BAG ONLY for outrageous price (currently $15.99) MISLEADING LISTING
review/text: My intention in writing this review is to clarify and warn BUYERS BEWARE that this price is an OUTRAGEOUSLY high price for a SINGLE, 10 oz. bag of popcorn. It looks like you get more than 1 item due to the $2.28/item shown in the listing. But I wrote the seller and found out the listing is for only 1 bag of popcorn. So I asked about what the $2.28/item referred to (since listing is only for 1 item - bag of popcorn), the response was that it represented cups. That's right, you are getting 7 cups @ $2.28 each = one 10 oz bag of popcorn. Yet the $2.28/item doesn't match the way the item is listed, which is in ounces (10oz). If you are selling it by the cup, rather than by ounces, then the listing should be listed in cups ($15.99= 7.013 cups x $2.28 per cup). I wrote the seller and explained that, "THIS LISTING IS CONFUSING AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED. OTHERWISE, I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT IT IS INTENTIONALLY CONFUSING, TO THE POINT OF BEING DECEPTIVE."  The seller's response was polite and professional and said they will work to get the issue resolved. However, I see a previous complaint listed here from months ago about the same issue (the high price and the customer not realizing it was for only ONE bag of popcorn). So until they make a change, I am posting this review as a way to clarify and inform all potential buyers that this listing is for ONLY ONE BAG OF POPCORN!!!!

review/summary: skinnypop popcorn
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor and texture of this product.  I rate it right up there with theater popcorn without all the calories and guilt. Being on weightwatchers is easier when you have a product like this where you can have a lot for few points. I have eaten the microwave style popcorn and for me this product is by far superior. I don't usually write reviews but just tried this product because I wanted to see if it actually tasted good since it appeared to me to be for dieter's and it sounded healthy.  I will certainly be buying more of this but hope it comes down in cost as most dieter's food items for some reason always costs more.

review/summary: don't return this
review/text: Please be aware that Cash & Carry has a huge selection of flavored syrups, for about $4.50/bottle. If you are purchasing from Specialty Restaurant Equipment, be very certain of your order. I bought 2 bottles and after about $11/bottle, plus $13.50 in shipping, I requested to return it, due to a duplicate order. Their response was that after the re-stocking fee and shipping reimbursement, I would have only received a $3 refund. So yes, we will be keeping the syrup and I'm sure it will stay in our pantry for at least 5 years. Our stupid mistake, but I think the vendor needs to reconsider about restocking fees unless they sell to actual businesses.

review/summary: Wafers from Parthenon Foods are outdated - by almost a year!
review/text: I purchased Loacker Wafers directly from Parthenon foods in late July 2011.  After I had opened them I saw on the back of the bag that the expiration/sell-by date was SEPTEMBER 2010!  When I contacted the customer service department about this, they assumed that I had eaten the crackers and said that I could not get a refund.  They failed to read my email which stated that I had thrown them in the garbage (I have kids - don't take chances w/ food)! I didn't want my money back, I just wanted fresh wafers.  Never heard from them again.  They lost a really good customer over $10 worth of cookies - poor management, if you ask me!<br /><br />BE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR SELL-BY DATE ON THE BACK OF THE PACKAGE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT OUTDATED.

review/text: I'm a huge tiramisu fan so I got this, but I was very disappointed because this tasted nothing like tiramisu. The cream is vaguely similar if you try really hard to match the two, but there is absolutely no coffee flavor, which to me is the crux of tiramisu. So yeah, it's still tasty, the wafer texture is great, but don't get your hopes up if you're hoping for tiramisu.

review/text: I discovered this in a little out-of-the-way store for a very good price and decided to try it.  Soooooo glad that I did!  I love this stuff so much I went back and purchased all that they had ($1.25 a tube!)along with the Napoleon pesto in a tube for the same price.  These products are so handy and very yummy!  For a quick appetizer for unexpected company, I will toast some french bread... smear it with EVOO, the garlic paste, the pesto.  Add some sliced tomatoes and basil leaves if handy and top off with some shredded cheese you have on hand... parmesan, asiago, etc.  Broil for a few minutes.  Takes all of 2 minutes to prepare and another couple to broil and you are done!  I am delighted to find that Amazon carries it as it has become a major staple in my pantry.  I gave one to my sister and she ate half of it before she got home...kept putting it on her finger and eating it.... we DO love our garlic!

review/summary: Wonderful tea
review/text: I bought this tea after reading a superb recommendation for it from a reliable source. I was a little wary about buying sight unseen, but I have to say the flavor matches the outstanding health benefits of this tea. Not surprising, since most quality items that are grown with care tend to excel in flavor as well.<br />This tea is very dry and shriveled, so the package is really packed. I usually get 3-4 cups of great tea per two tablespoons of leaves. This tea is meant to be used up pretty fast. In fact, this package should be used up in about six months, so the size is about right.<br />I find the flavor holds up well, with or without a sweetener. Goes well with honey (I prefer it straight).<br />Nutritional information is on the package, independent lab tested, but this tea is carefully cultivated and it really is a cut above anything else I have found on the market.<br />Great buy for an exceptional product. Worth every penny.

review/text: This is excellent tea. I have to admit that the packaging and brand name (eXtreme health) put me off a little bit, but as they say, the proof is in the pudding. The tea had the perfect level of flavor and sweetness (natural sweetness) which to me usually indicates a superior tea. It is not temperamental in terms of brewing, and does not easily turn astringent with slight over-steeping. I am not sure where this tea is grown, but kudos to the farmer. It is far better than several very expensive varieties I have ordered directly from Japan.

review/summary: Best tasting green tea
review/text: We drink a lot of tea as a family and have a huge variety in the house at any given time. I have been wanting to go to a loose leaf green tea for health reasons and bought this one because of the reviews and great price here at Amazon. This has to be the best tasting green tea I have ever tried, loose or bagged. It is almost sweet without even the honey I like to add. It also is not bitter, at all. Just great all around tea. As a side note it takes us about three months to go through the bag but there are two adults that drink it regularly.<br /><br />**UPDATE** This was out of stock for a long time and when it did come back in, I immediately ordered. I don't know what happened but it is almost inedible now, really bad after taste. This is not the tea I was drinking before.

It is almost completely tasteless, just a slight fruity flavour, it does not resemble any green tea that I have bought in the past when living in Japan or from Asian markets in the USA. There is not a hint of green colour in the tea and the leaf is dry, large and not compacted at all in the bag. In fact, the leaves are too big to fit in a tea ball.<br />Does this tea really contain more antioxidants and polyphenols? Can not find substantiation from USDA.<br />They talk a good talk but product is severely lacking.

review/summary: Waste of money
review/text: All the people giving this tea high reviews based on taste have obviously never had quality green tea. It's quite flavorless other than a bit of bitterness. A quick way to assess the quality of a green tea is to look at the color of the tea it produces. A good green tea will give a vibrant green color (hence the name), a bad one will give you various shades of brown. This tea definitely falls into the latter category. I would not recommend this product to anyone who considers themselves a fan of quality green tea, nor will I buy again.

review/summary: Great Stuff.  Really Great Stuff.
review/text: Green tea has grown for me over the years.  I admit that there was a time when I turned my nose up at green tea in any form, prefering Lady Grey (made only by Twinings) or English Breakfast or even Constant Comment. I know, I know.<br /><br />Tea also had literary or historical connections for me:  Rooibos Tea became a stable in my pantry after I began reading Alexander McCall Smith's No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series.  Earl Grey Tea was always around, given that I read somewhere that it was the favorite of Queen Elizabeth - and she should know good tea, right?  And, of course Earl Grey isn't that far from Lady Grey - LG is just lighter, more citrusy, and I think makes a better batch iced.<br /><br />Bottom line, if all these flavors sound similar to your particular taste in tea, then this review may be helpful to you.<br /><br />Over time, as I became more aware of the health benefits of tea, I gave green teas a second look.  Today, I drink lots of green tea.  Daily.  Almost exclusively.  Iced in the summer (I'm in Texas) and hot in the winter.  With all this tea drinking, I still don't consider myself any sort of tea expert - but I am somewhat picky now, and with that caveat to you, here's my take on Extreme Health's Organically Grown Green Tea, Loose Leaf.<br /><br />1.  This is just about the best green tea I've ever had.<br /><br />2.  It doesn't take much, this stuff packs a wallop.  Which means that the big, silver bag of green tea you receive will last you awhile. My estimate: the silver bag should last you around 5 - 6 months, unless you really go nuts or you've got lots of hands dipping in here. (Family members, the whole dorm floor, whatever.)<br /><br />3.  You may find it is sweet enough on its own.  This tea has a wonderful taste, and while I do like my stevia, it's true that this particular green tea, for me, tastes nice on occasion without anything added to it as a sweetener.<br /><br />4.  I feel better with this particular brand of green tea.  Perhaps it is one of Life's Mysteries.  Perhaps it is the quality of this brand of green tea.  Maybe it's all in my head.  Whatever.  I find that I think more clearly, and just feel better throughout the day, having had some of the Extreme Health green tea to start my day.  This, in comparison to other brands of green tea - loose and bagged.<br /><br />The only way I could enjoy this tea more, I suppose, is if I learned that it was the favorite tea of Jeeves or Agatha Christie or Winston Churchill etc., etc.  It's just great stuff.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />- Reba Kennedy

review/text: This is one of the few gluten free products which is whole grain. Most others have ingredients such as potato starch and tapioca. This is truly whole grain. I use it as a pan bread. I make sweet pan breads and also savory pan breads. I add one or more ingredients each time I make it. A single item to add into the batter might be: dry lemon peel, shredded carrots, frozen green peas, caraway seeds, black pepper or whole grain mustard. Sets of items can be added to the batter: minced apples & apple pie spice, corn nibblets & parmesan, tomato paste & black pepper, raisins & cinnamon, minced veggies & celery seeds, instant coffee & cinnamon, mashed banana & ground cloves or orange bitters & cinnamon. If cooked a long time at low heat you'll end up with a cracker. It can actually be made with just water. I add only Eggbeaters and soy milk. I've never added any fat. Made that way a portion made with 1/3 cup of the mix is 5 Weight Watchers PointsPlus.

review/summary: experimenting as a new user
review/text: I have so far tried this mix only once, and intend to continue tweaking the recipe.  So far I used almond milk rather than dairy (great) and I added extra fluid (almond milk, a little water) to thin the batter further.  I made tiny trial pancakes from each adjusted (in thickness) batter.  Each pancake turned out fine, so it's just for the sake of learning what we might like more.<br /><br />Here's the best news--it's not just for the gluten-free family member anymore.  It's already become our favorite pancake mix ever--for everyone in the house (and we are NOT a pancake-loving bunch).  It reminds me of buckwheat pancakes I had years ago, but this is way better--I love the flavor and way more substantial texture.  By the way, it's not sweet, which is great, because I prefer putting the sweetness on top.  I look forward to experimenting further--it seems one can't go wrong.<br /><br />(this is going to be on our "subscribe & save" list)

review/summary: Healthier ingredients, off taste though
review/text: I was thrilled to see that this product did not contain all of the typical starches found in most gluten free products.  The primary ingredient in these is Sorghum flour.  I added a bit more milk then what was called for and also added a bit of vanilla extract to the mix.  The pancakes cook perfectly and are not dense at all.  They are light and fluffy as you would expect in a pancake.  They do not turn light brown when cooked like most pancakes, but color isn't important to me at all.<br /><br />For the negatives... the Sorghum flour tends to leave an off taste that is acceptable if you are having pancakes with just butter and maple syrup.  Drinking orange juice though seems to enhance the off taste to the point where I don't want to drink OJ with the pancakes as the juice then tastes awful with each sip.  I'm not sure if its my pallet or sorghum in general, but figured I'd mention it.  I'll likely buy it again though.

I was surprised at how good these came out and I think the price here can't be beat, especially at my local natural foods store who sells this stuff at a premium. Be creative and add fruits or berries and nuts and it will not only take the place of your normal waffle but it's like splurging when you really aren't. To make mine I added vanilla and a tsp of sugar then topped it with earth balance butter and maple syrup.

It also works in the waffle maker with flax gel egg substitue.  It took a year of searching to find it but we love it.  It also handles add-ins like cinnamon or chocolate chips or grated apples.  If you are only used to the white rice flour mixes, it might take some adjustment.  A little extra cooking time behond when my waffle maker says its done makes it crispier.

review/summary: You can fit 63!
review/text: I use three of these across one of my storage shelves in my kitchen. I also have the large drawer that fits under the Keurig. Essentially these 54 pod drawers are for my overflow.<br />This particular brand - Nifty - is... well.... quiet nifty! It's reasonably priced. There are other brands that make this same exact drawer and charge a lot more.<br />Hypothetically speaking, since I use this for storage, I supposed I could use the actual boxes the K cups come in.... but the nice thing about these drawers is that you can easily see when you are running low... versus going in the pantry and sticking your hand in your favorite K cup box to find only a few left (or worse... empty, because some used the last one and didn't tell you!).<br /><br />I think my only con to this is that the drawers are not smooth sliding drawers. Sometimes you have to shimmy the drawer a bit. But that holds true for those 'other' pricer versions as well.<br /><br />Also... you can actualy fit more than 54 in this drawer. I can fit 63. If you alternate between storing each K cup top side up and bottom side up in each row... you can fit 1 extra cup in each row. However, I don't think all of the rows are exactly the same size. The middle row of each drawer is a bit snug. I end up only doing this extra-cup-concept in the outside rows.

Because of limited counter space I was able to stack one on top of the other and still slide them under my kitchen cabinets.Also,they were very sturdy one on top of the other.Looks  great next to the coffee maker.Would definitely recommend.

review/text: I absolutely love this! I can add my mugs and creamer on top. Did figure out if you stagger the k cups right side up, upside down, right side up, ect. You can fit 9 more into this! I recommend this 100%
