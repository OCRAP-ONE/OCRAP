review/summary: Almost pure
review/text: I am sensitive to the contents of the artificial sweeteners available. This one is still relatively pure Stevia. The 'extras' are for making the pills stay together, and for disolving in drinks. The pills are fairly robust - they don't fall apart if kept dry - and they fiz a bit when put in liquids. AOK!

review/text: I should of realized that that concentrated of pill would not work in cold water but I didn't. I bought these for putting in my ice tea and I did and they didn't dissolve. I waited and waited and they didn't dissolve. So next I thought I would put them in a small bowl and put hot tap water in to melt them, I did and it took around 4 minutes to dissolve completely. That's just too long for me.<br />If you're not using them in piping hot coffee I would suggest getting Stevia in either liquid or granulated. This I would pass on.

Animal fat is your friend, not your enemy!<br /><br />Lose weight and never feel hungry following this simple bit of advice.

review/text: After reading the reviews, I thought I would give this a try.  I cannot tolerate aspartame, gives me horrible headaches, Splenda too and I can't stand the taste of saccharin.  I had such high hopes.<br /><br />This stuff is very difficult to dissolve, even in warm liquid and stirring.  The only way I can describe the taste is - chemical causing my taste buds to think it is sweet. Yes, it is very sweet - for the initial taste, then all I get is a chemical aftertaste.  I used one dot, and have given away the rest.<br /><br />I have only used it as a sweetener in iced tea, haven't tried using it any other way.  I will just revert to unsweetened tea.  I would rather go without than deal with this very artificial sweetener.

NO, it was only ONE and the same as the 4 dollar one I bought in the supermarket. What a rip off! In terms of the quality of the quinoa, they are pretty good and I would recommend it buying somewhere else. This is ridiculous....but it's my own fault of not reading it clearly.

review/summary: The Only Sugar Substitute Without The Scary Health Warnings
review/text: I am used to see either the pink (saccharin) or the blue (aspartame) envelope. One warns about cancer while the other one warns about brain damage. Splenda does not have any of those. Now, the pink and the blue are gone from our work office. First approved for use in Canada in 1991 and later on in the US in 1998.<br /><br />Splenda is multiple times sweeter than the previous sugar substitutes. Unlike saccharin, Splenda does not have a metallic aftertaste.<br /><br />Another advantage is that Splenda is stable under heat and can be used for baking.

review/summary: Not what I hoped for
review/text: I make a lot of soups and also often use chicken bullion when I make beans or sauces.  After getting disgusted with not being able to find one without "Salt, MSG..." as the first two ingredients on the label I turned to Amazon and found this.  After receiving it today and making a sample cup of broth I have to say I'm really disappointed in it.<br /><br />First of all, there's no "chicken" in the ingredients at all.  The closest we have to anything animal is "CSC shortening" -- I don't know what that particular product is but much of the time shortenings are trans-fats which are extremely unhealthy for you.  The last ingredient listed is "Other Spices" which is often a codeword for MSG.<br /><br />Basically, as far as I can tell from the product list and taste of the final product this is a jar full of tumeric and celery and onion powder.  When you use it to make broth you end up with a substance that's the same color, opacity, and viscosity as orange juice and that tastes not at all of chicken broth.  It also has a film of semisolid granules floating at the top that have the consistency of those little orange fish eggs you sometimes find on sushi (my guess is that it's either the shortening or poorly dissolved celery powder) that would have to be skimmed off of any soup you made if you wanted people to actually eat it.<br /><br />The next two products I will try in my search for a low/no sodium chicken base is Herb Ox's Sodium Free Chicken Bullion (which potassium cholride as a substitute for salt and monoammonium glutamate as a sub for MSG, an imperfect solution to just leaving them out) and if that doesn't taste good then I'll probably end up with the "low" sodium Better Than Bullion chicken stock paste product, which I know at least tastes right even though it still has an awful lot of salt in there and is much more expensive than regular bullion.

Most of the were horrible, with the exception of Xylichew. This gum holds its flavor for several mins. Even after the flavor is gone the gum does not get hard. So, I will chew for hrs. without replacing. While my mouth enjoyed Xylichew, my pocket did not. This was the most expensive of all of the non-aspartame gums offered at Whole Foods. So, I decided to search for it on Amazon. The prices on Amazon were much better. I found a gum that I like (but you will need 2 pieces at one time given the size of 1 piece) at a price that I can tolerate.

review/text: Xylitol is fantastic for dental health.<br /><br />This gum is great because it doesn't contain any of the less-than-ideal additives (like aspartame-nutrasweet, saccharin, sorbitol, mannitol, artificial flavors, artificial colors, etc.) that make most other gums and mints, even those with xylitol as an ingredient, problematic.<br /><br />The flavor is nice, the texture is fine, and it lasts for at least 15 minutes (which is all I want it to do).<br /><br />Note that this gum is manufactured in Finland and the xylitol is sourced from birch wood [also, it's non-GMO (not genetically modified)], which is not the case with some other brands of xylitol products, which source their xylitol from China and/or from corn.<br /><br />I wish that this gum could be purchased in smaller amounts, because the price for this company's giant containers/packs is quite a lot of money to spend on something you've never tried before.  I'm sure more people would give them a try if they packaged this in one 30-piece, portable little cardboard box, and sold it as an "add-on" product at Amazon for 2 dollars or something, just so folks could try it out.

review/text: Although these are sugar free, they don't taste it and they don't leave a weird aftertaste in your mouth when you're done with them. The taste lasts longer then the Glee Gum I purchased, which has sugar in it. Great for diabetics and anyone else who doesn't want to chew on sugar!!

review/summary: Only in moderation...they're not Tic-Tacs!
review/text: The flavor of these is great, but it doesn't last as long as the leading sugar-free gum and it isn't as "juicy."  If you've ever tried the small square-shaped gum in the small candy machines then you will know what kind of fleeting flavor to expect from this.  I have also noticed its effect when you chew more than 2 or 3 pieces within a few hours...it can cause some serious bloating! If you want something to chew on for 10 to 30 minutes after a meal then try this.  If you are looking for a substitute for candy or something to keep you awake in the afternoon, you may want to proceed with extreme caution or get something else.  I wouldn't recommend these as something you can indulge in constantly throughout the day like tic-Tacs or Junior Mints.  However, as something to chew 1 or 2 pieces of after a meal for 10 minutes, I have no problems with them.

review/text: I buy this gum at my local heath food store for $15.00 a bottle. It tastes great but does not last 15 minutes. I eat 3 pieces at one time. It still only lasts about 20 minutes. When you keep it in your mouth for more than 1 hour it starts to fall apart. I would recommend buying it if you like xylitol gum. If not try Spry gum. It last a little longer and has lots of flavors.

review/summary: Gourmet Gum, Non-Carcinogenic
review/text: I like Xylichew because I can defend it as a health food. The xylitol supposedly reduces cavities, and the gum does not contain anything harmful unlike Xyloburst and Spry, which have a carcinogen, titanium dioxide, that is thought to cause cancer in human beings. Those products made in China for Americans should not be purchased by intelligent Americans. Titanium Dioxide is nothing more than a food coloring. So Xylichew will not be perfectly white. If this causes your brain to explode, then you had better buy Spry instead and subject your body to the ravages of cancer.<br /><br />The flavor does not last forever, because it's natural, but so what? One way to counter that would be to pop a mint in your mouth while chewing and let the gum absorb the mint flavor.

review/summary: Great coffee flavor. And very, very smooth
review/text: It's hard to describe flavor, isn't it? I would compare the smoothness and body of this coffee to a Panama Boquete, but with a much more intense coffee flavor.<br /><br />When my order arrived today I immediately ground a sample and pulled a shot of espresso with my twenty year old Gaggia. Great crema on the first try. That tells me the beans are quite fresh.<br /><br />This is described as a dark roast. I'd describe it as something like "full city roast plus." It's dark...but not too dark. The beans are just to the point of releasing some oils, but not full on oily. The aroma upon opening the bag is great. And when grinding, that aroma just gets better.<br /><br />Regardless of crema, aroma and appearance, the proof is in the tasting and I can only say that this coffee gets very high marks. It is rich, low acid coffee with a great mouth feel and great coffee flavor. I think it's well worth a try and personally I know that I'll be ordering it again.

review/summary: Good deal, but consider freshness
review/text: This is a great price for some good beans, and the awesome Amazon prime shipping is just icing on the cake. However, one important thing to consider: When you buy direct from the roaster's website, the beans are roasted fresh and shipped within a day or two. When you buy from Amazon, though, the beans come from a stack of bags that have been sitting in an Amazon warehouse somewhere. The date code is printed on the bags, and mine was over 6 months old! Anyway, this roaster does make a great product, but I would recommend buying direct from their website. Prices are comparable, so the only downside is you'll have to pay for shipping yourself.

Brazilian coffee is mild and smooth whereas I prefer a coffee with more of an edge.

It is not as good as the house blend which is always  freshly roasted from Full City in Eugene... but it is half the price...and as Yogi said, a nickles just not worth a dime anymore.  If you like it very strong try 6 mins in  a French Press...if not, drip is just fine.  I would not freeze beans to store as others have advised.

review/summary: Best bang for your buck
review/text: This has been my go-to coffee bean for the last 2 years.  To say that I've tried many brands and flavors would be an understatement.<br /><br />What I find remarkable about this bean is that it delivers the full flavor of a bold roast without being overly bitter.  Whether you make your coffee on the weak side or crank it up to heart-fluttering strength, the flavor will keep you coming back for more.<br /><br />Another point of significance:  this bean delivers a great flavor whether you use a drip machine, espresso maker, or even an AeroPress.  Some brands/flavors tend to favor a specific prep-method, being great as an espresso-bean but delivering mediocre quality in a drip maker (or vice versa).  The Dark Brazillian manages to play every position on the field - amazing!<br /><br />What more can I say?  If it's my money being spent, I'm spending it on Dark Brazillian by Coffee Bean Direct :)

review/summary: Disappointing taste.
review/text: Upon opening the bag, the aroma of the whole beans was very good, the beans looked good (but maybe covered in a wax?), but looked almost artificially glossy.  Was expecting high hopes, as some of the best beans I've had are Sical 5 Estrelas that are from Brazil (though not very easy to find since Nestle bought the company) for espresso.  Well, the taste of these are not good.  Brazilian beans are known for mild flavor, these are some of the most bitter beans I've tried.  My suggestion is to pass and keep looking for something else.  If you're looking for Brazillian beans, I suggest looking for Sical Vera Cruz or 5 Estrelas or the Lavazza brands.

review/summary: Superiour coffee. Excellent price.
review/text: I wouldn't rate this five stars if the rating applied only to the quality of the coffee.  That said, this is a very good coffee and is likely superior to the gourmet coffees that have been sitting on the shelf in a typical supermarket.  It's well rounded, neither too acidic nor bland for my tastes, and I look forward to the couple cups I start my day with.  Note that last qualification; it's extremely important.<br /><br />In the vast scheme of things, five pounds of coffee is not a lot.  I'm fairly certain that there are many places the world over where more coffee has accumulated.  Even my child weighed more than five pounds at birth, and I'm grateful for that.  However five pounds of coffee delivered to my house is more coffee than has ever gathered there, and if it were five pounds of bad coffee... well, that's kind of a serious situation to have on one's hands.<br /><br />Thankfully the coffee is pretty good and in the nearly three months it's taken me to work my way through it I've had no regrets. So put those beans in the freezer (store it in smaller zip-lock bags if the package is too bulky), only grind what you need when you need it, and enjoy.<br /><br />I give it five stars because it's very good coffee at an excellent price.

review/text: Nearing the end of a 5# bag, we've enjoyed this coffee. Smooth, low acid, good coffee flavor. Makes a nice creamy espresso with our Gaggia. The flavor does not stand out as a definite varietal; it's good coffee, but not a 'wow, that's a Sumatra' kind of experience. Underwhelming in the french press for this reason - a good solid cup, no complaints, no wow either. As other reviewers have said, the roast is on the lighter side of dark, a little oily but not downright stinky. Pick this coffee if you want ample satisfaction without any of the extremes that produce delight or offense.

review/summary: Very good, but better blended with something else :)
review/text: It's so hard to describe tastes, how do I write a helpful review? I like to grind my own coffee right before brewing and I use a french press every day and when I'm lazy and also like to make Turkish coffee on special occasions for 1 or 2 friends or just myself.<br /><br />I like dark (but not too dark, not bitter) earthy brews - I usually steer away from "bright acidity" and "fruity" beans (though when I taste those I can still tell if it's good coffee or not). I drink my coffee with sugar, but no milk (except sometimes when I'm in the mood). I also don't like overly dark, skunky or burnt coffee. I really don't care about how much caffeine is in the beans, but if you must know the darker roasts have less caffeine remaining, even though they may taste "stronger" :0)<br /><br />Just for reference: I like Peet's "Major Dickason blend" and Starbucks "Verona" blend and Espresso roast, they're not the "best", but indicative of what I'm going for. But I really don't like what Starbucks puts in their cups, which everyone carries like they're wearing a uniform.<br /><br />Anyway, I bought a 5 lb. bag of these Dark Brazilian Santos and also a regular version. I like the dark a little better, but they both taste like versions of itself and are very good, well rounded, solid beans. I ordered these because I can't really find Brazilian beans anywhere locally and also because I like their low acidity.<br /><br />But these beans on their own don't really produce the most complex (or "interesting") cup - I use these to mix with certain more assertive coffees I got from Costco, to stretch them out and breathe a little more interest. I think they're ideal for that, because they're good enough where they don't take away flavor, but neutral enough not to take over the flavor.<br /><br />I don't regret buying these and Coffee Bean Direct is a great deal, but I will try another kind next time - I usually only come back to exceptional brews and I only just discovered CBD, so there's more to try.<br /><br />Perhaps, if I owned a coffee shop or a pastry shop or cafe, I would use these (and their darker version) because it seems like the coffee that would please everyone. These are like home-made chicken soup - impossible to hate (and SO much better than store bought), but also not really a 3-star entree :)<br /><br />I hope this helps, if you have questions I'll try to respond :)

Looked for about 45 minutes reading all reviews and this Dark Brazilian Santos appeared to meet all my needs.  Received the coffee really fast and brewed it the next morning.  WOW!  I LOVE COFFEE!  Have been brewing and drinking 2 cups every morning for the past week!!

It has a rich taste but is also very smooth. It is a coffee you can enjoy to begin your day or to follow an evening meal.  We would recommend you give it a try.

review/summary: Excellent coffee
review/text: My first order from Coffee Bean Direct was the Brazillian Santos, which I was very happy with, but I also love darker roasts so I decided to give this a try.  So far I'm happy.  The quality is excellent and it produces a nice, strong, reasonably complex cup.  I'm still toying with how much coffee to grind, as I like it strong, but not ridiculous.  But, so far, so good.<br /><br />EDIT:  after going through a bag of this, I'd say that I like this a bit less than the regular Santos.  I feel that the dark roasting takes away a bit of the distinctness of the Santos coffee, and makes it a tad more of a generic dark roast.  Still good, but not as good as the regular Santos.

review/summary: Making my second order
review/text: I've tried a couple of other coffees through amazon.  The best was probably Cameron's Organic French Roast, but just by a hair above the Dark Brazilian Santos. Another one I tried was Coffee Bean Direct French Roast Papua New Guinea which really didn't taste like real french roast.It was just okay.  The worst was Eight O'Clock French Roast.  The beans were pale, not oily and this was reflected in the pale boring taste of the brewed coffee. As soon as I opened the bag of Dark Brazilian I could see that the beans were dark and oily and the flavor was a truly rich french roast.  There may be better french roast coffees out there but for the price this is an excellent buy. I would highly recommend this to any  french roast loving coffee drinkers out there.

I've been alternating between this dark Brazilian Santos and the Italian Roast Expresso flavors.  Both are strong and satisfying, though the dark Brazilian Santos does have a richer flavor.  Why 4 stars and not 5?  The cost of this flavor is notably higher than the Italian Roast Expresso.

I have yet to make it as vacuum coffee, but that is always the best.  Totally recommend this coffee.

So, not only are we disappointed, we are without coffee.  I ordered three five pound bags.  We love the French Roast and Italian Roast both and we are now trying Brazilian Santos.  I have also enjoyed the chocolate before.  All are great products, well packaged and at a reasonable price.  I would hope the orders can be filled by adapting your order form for military postal deliveries.

I've tried some of the other Coffee Bean Direct beans including one that I just didn't like at all. I found Amazon and Coffee Bean Direct very good to deal with in rectifying the situation and even sending a sample of a couple of other beans for me to try.

review/summary: The reasonable price makes this one a 5-star.
review/text: This is an excellent 4-star coffee in its own right, and the very reasonable price (especially with Subscribe and Save) earns that extra star.  It lacks any specifically notable brewed aroma, but the flavor is excellent and incredibly mellow with absolutely no bitterness and a very nice aftertaste.  In fact, it may be a bit too mellow for some folks, but all-in-all it is hard to believe anyone would not enjoy this roast. Some may find it necessary to increase the quantity a bit over a more intense bean,  and that seems to work extremely well for this bean since it seems to have no bitterness whatsoever.  I suppose this might be a bit difficult for some machines.  You might enjoy adjusting  quantity a bit no matter what your preferences- this coffee seems to handle it well and the adjustments can be interesting.<br /><br />One other characteristic is very important for my own lifestyle and this bean matches up very nicely:  I am single and use a French press, making a beaker in the morning and then microwaving per-cup all morning and into the afternoon.  This coffee is very forgiving  in tolerating that process.  I assume this is largely due to its exceptional mellow nature, but whatever it is, it works.  Blasphemy perhaps, but on occasion I even rewarm an overnight remainder while waiting for the kettle to boil in the morning, and even that cup is tolerable (OK- maybe barely so).<br /><br />I will have to add that this is based upon my one-and-only order of this brand-bean-roast thus far.  I will definitely be ordering again, but as with most any "crop" and processing there can certainly be variations.  That certainly seems to apply here if some of the "bitter" comments are accurate.  Nothing about bag #1 could be termed "bitter" by anyone.
