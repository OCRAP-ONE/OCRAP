review/summary: Just right measure of tartness!
review/text: Purchased these originally for my son in law because he likes tart cherries, and decided, based on the reviews that I wanted to try them as well. In my opinion, they are excellent! Not too tart and not too sweet. If you are looking for a pucker your mouth tartness, these are not for you. I have used them on cereals, eat them plain, add them in with other fruits for a fruit salad and even cook with them! Tart cherries are touted for their antioxidant properties and their ability to reduce joint pain over time. I have found these an excellent substitute for raisins!

review/summary: traverse bay fruit-dried cherries
review/text: I lived in the Traverse Bay area for a number of years which is how I became familiar with dried cherries. Now that I live across the country I was amazed to find that Amazon sells this delicious fruit. I use it for EVERYTHING: I mix it in trail mix, eat it straight out of the bag(my favorite), mix it in sauces over turkey, beef, fish, mix it in muffins, over french toast, over ice cream, cereals etc. You are limited by your own imagination with these dried cherries. I would not hesitate to recommend this healthy product and plan to buy more when what I have is gone.

review/summary: Tastes great and so convenient
review/text: I bought these using the subscription method so the price is better than any other supplier I have found.  They taste very similar to the ones I was getting at Wegman's so I am not sure why some would find them tart or foul tasting. When I get the package I separate it into several bags and freeze what I am not going to eat and leave one bag open so I can grab a few when I feel the need.  I do like them to dry a bit more so as they lay in an opened bag they get a little firmer and to me they lose no taste.  I set it up so that when I am just about done with the last bag of my order there is a box on my porch. They let you set up how often you receive a new order so you can tailor it to how little or much you eat. I find them to be just the ticket when you have the munchies but do not want to eat a meal. Pop a few in your mouth and usually I am fine until I decide to eat a real meal.  This is my third box and each has been very similar in taste. Oh I weigh the bags I make and so far every box had more cherries by weight than listed on the box.

review/summary: Really enjoy these dried cherries
review/text: I like craisins and other dried fruits that are chewy (like raisins, but raisins are kind of boring and common).  These cherries  are fantastic.  I've received a couple orders so far and shipping and packaging are perfect.  They come in a single 4 pound bag, so I split them into smaller bags or one big zip lock bag.  I sometimes give them out as gifts (a sandwich baggy full) and people are really happy to receive them and have many different things they use them for, from baking (biscotti) to just eating them as a snack.  I like them as snacks and as toppings on cereal.<br /><br />I probably would not purchase these at normal price (only because I am on a tight budget).  I am accustomed to getting them at a discount and a subscribe & save discount (total ~ $20 + free shipping).

So far have only tried for snacking, but I'm sure they'd be good in baked goods as well, in fact will probably try that this Christmas.

review/text: I found these cherries to be of very good quality.  They are juicy, tart with the right amount of sweetness. However, there are just so MANY of them that I wish someone else in this house enjoyed dried cherries, too :-)  Keep in mind:  These dried cherries arrive in one big bag in the shipping box.  They are not subdivided into multiple, smaller packages which I would have preferred.  Nevertheless, they are a good quality snack.  Due to the tartness, I can only eat a few of these at the time.  So I think they would be even better used for baking or for including in a trail mix.

review/text: This is the second 4-pound box of these dried cherries that I have bought through Amazon.  They are really excellent, a perfect blend of tart and sweet, either on cereal or as a snack.  Since 4 pounds is a lot,<br />what I do when I open the box is separate them into four portions using quart size plastic storage bags.  That way, you can just work on one bag at a time, and they stay fresh.  Four pounds lasts a very long time, so for the price<br />it is really a great value.

review/text: I actually bought my first box of cherries in person when visiting Michigan, but am so pleased to find them online.  These are BY FAR the best tasting dried cherries I've ever had.  It's so much truer to what a good, farm picked cherry would taste like.  In our area, the next best price is one of the bulk box stores--but these just blow the competitors away (even the dried cherries found at the health/organic food stores).  I'd even pay a little more for the significantly better quality--but now I won't have to!  :)

A great buy in bulk, compared to what I find in our local supermarkets which are very pricey! These are nice sized and fresh too! They would be great in trail mix.

review/text: Being a person with almost no patience, I had to open the Amazon package that arrived today within seconds of it's delivery. Inside was the box of cherries, that box was opened too as was the package of dried cherries inside. Plucked a cherry from the package just to have a quick taste before running off to work for the day. The taste stopped me dead in my tracks !! Really, it did. I just had to grab a sandwich bag and fill it with cherries to take with me.<br />These cherries are absolutely delicious, fresh, soft and chewy, sweet but not too sweet, a little firm and not at all hard and they are full flavored.<br />No kidding, I ate a herd of them today.<br /><br />  Can't wait to have a day off to try cooking with them... imagine the possibilities: Cherry Scones, biscuits, NY Cheesecake with dried cherries stirred in the recipe, on cereal in the morning, Oh! what about cherry pancakes or waffles? Maybe add a few crushed walnuts or pecans. In a salad with cherry vinaigrette dressing maybe add a few pine nuts and a few grates of cheddar cheese. Trail mix with dried cherries? Cherry cobbler, cherry oatmeal cookies, chicken in cherry sauce. Yep, I'm going to be doing some cooking.

review/summary: 1st box=perfect,  2nd box=rancid oil
review/text: My first order of cherries was perfection.  So moist and flavorful.  Just delightful.  I hurried and ordered a second shipment.  I was so disappointed!  The cherries are coated with a thin film of oil to keep them moist.  Well, this time the oil was rancid.  Yuck!  So bad tasting.  I really was surprised, since the first order had been perfect.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement right out, no charge.  So, we will see how this next box will be.<br /><br />I so hope it will be ok, since I really do love the cherries and plan to keep them on subscription to come at regular intervals.<br /><br />Did anyone else have this happen to them?<br /><br />I'm so sad about the box of wasted cherries.<br />********************************************<br />UPDATE:  Happy to report that Amazon quickly sent a replacement box and it was perfect.  So, I am happy with the cherries and will continue to order with confidence that they will replace any defective product.  Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Great ... IF you use a lot of cherries in a hurry
review/text: I really like the cherries, but I don't like the packaging.  When I bought from this same supplier in the past (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYEO">Traverse Bay Dried Fruit, Dried Cherries, 2-Pound Bags (Pack of 2)</a>) the bags were resealable, which is nice for those of us who aren't cooking enough at one time to feed a small army.<br />These cherries taste great right now, but since the packaging is not resealable I had to transfer them to something that CAN be sealed so they will stay fresh.  After all, most of us don't go through cherries by the pound in a short period of time.<br />When I checked today the cherries in two resealable 2 pound bags were selling for slightly less than this box that is nominally the same size.

review/summary: Can you eat 4 pounds of cherries...YES!
review/text: I stumbled upon these on Amazon and went for it not knowing what I was going to do with 4 pounds of dried cherries. When they came I began eating them and didn't stop until they were gone. I'm not sure how long it took but it was probably less than a month and they were gone. They are VERY good. Great in salads, making your own trailmix or just by the handful. Traverse City, MI knows cherries and these are the best I've had.

review/text: I purchased these yummy cherries in mid January ('11), and they are just as moist and tasty as when I first got them, and I store them in the cabinet.<br />I still probably have at least 1.5 lbs left of the 4lb bag.<br /><br />I love to use them in hot cereal, my latest fave being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VLV7OM">Bob's Red Mill Cereal 8 Grain Wheatless, 27-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>I also add sliced almonds, cocoa powder, a pinch of salt, cinnamon, and some coconut oil (after it's cooked). Fast, easy, healthy, and delicious! They're just plain good any way you choose to eat them!

These cherries are not overly sweet, but have a more of a tart to them. They also hold together well in our machine. They also make a good substitute for raisins in trail mixes. We store our excess in Mason Jars in fridge. Recommend them highly.

However, as HOT as it's gotten here in Texas there's NO WAY I'm turning on the oven.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, these are not the Tart Cherries many health fanatics are seeking. These are sweet and yummy and worth a try at the right price.

review/text: I personally love fruit in most everything.  I brought these and to my surprise my daughter and DH loves them. They eat them when having a sweet craving and in their oatmeal and because they're sweet you don't need sugar.  I think it's better than their love for Snickers (which will never die ~ we keep a case in the freezer for emergencies). I drop them in salads and cookies and when I am out of candy I just melt some chocolate bark add almonds and these cherries and life is good again ;-)

review/summary: Best dried cherries if quality maintains
review/text: It is my first time ordering these cherries. They are actually over my expectation.<br />It came with one big bag. As soon as i open the bag, nice and fresh aroma come out. Each of them size about half of fresh Bing cherry. they are very moist and have good balance of sweet and tart taste. They are by far the best dry cherries i ever have.<br />I put most of them into foodsaver bag immediately to preserve the moist.<br /><br />updated 04/11/2011<br />Received second box of dried cherries. This time i am not so satisfied, the dried cherries are too dry, like regular raisin. So now I understand why some reviews mentioned the cherries are not so moisture.<br /><br />The first box i received last week: It was packed in a blue bag, sell by 03/24/2012. Each of them size about half of fresh Bing cherry. And they are really moisture;<br />The second box i received today: It was packed in a clear bag, sell by 03/01/2012. Each of them size about 1/3 of fresh Bing cherry. And they are not so moisture, like regular raisin.<br /><br />For both box, the balance of tart and sweet are same, but i reduce the review from 5 star to 4 star because the dried cherries do not maintain consistency on moisturize.

Both are described the same, but the higher priced product is significantly better -- larger in size, more flesh, much better flavor.<br /><br />Differently stated, this lower-priced product, while described exactly the same as the higher-priced, is an inferior product, suitable for cooking, nowhere near as good for snacking.

The price on Amazon is comparable to the price in the local supermarket there and shipping is free if you purchase 2 boxes!  They keep very well for months in the original box or in plastic containers.<br /><br />These are the absolute best dried cherries anywhere.  I cook them in my morning oatmeal and make trail mix.  I also add 1/2-1 cup of dried cherries to my chocolate chip cookie dough.  Absolutely divine!

review/text: I love dried cherries and use them for dishes both sweet and savory, as well as for breakfasts and snacking.  I noticed I was paying $7.99 at the grocery story about once a month for a 12 oz package and decided to see if on-line offered better options.  I bought these, loved them, and then signed up for a "subscription" where I receive 4lbs every 3 months (you can choose the frequency) and earn at discount of I think 20%.  Net, net...these are about 1/2 the price of the ones in the store, as good or better tasting.  Nice blend of sweet and tart, and as "fresh" as you'd want in a dried fruit.

review/summary: Michigan's Best
review/text: Our favorite thing in Michigan is the cherries.  We purchased some dried cherries this summer, as gifts and they were delicious.  These Traverse Bay Dried Cherries taste just as great as the ones purchased this summer but we're keeping them all to ourselves!  They are great on hot cereal and in cookies or just for a snack.

review/summary: The best cherries come from Michigan!
review/text: I bought a box of these in Michigan last year.  When I was close to running out, I started an internet search & found them on Amazon.  Cherry Chicken Salad is my absolute favorite lunch.  Just top any salad greens with cold, diced grilled chicken breast.  Then sprinkle chopped dried cherries and either chopped walnuts or almonds over the greens.  Top with Ken's Honey Mustard dressing.  Yumm!!! Michigan fruited oatmeal is another favorite.  Mix chopped cherries, 1/2 cup applesauce a little brown sugar, chopped nuts of choice with 1C. old-fashioned oats and 2 C. of milk.  Bake, uncovered, for 45 min. at 350 degrees.  Serve hot or chill.  I prefer it cold. Sweet cherries dry too sweet for my taste, but these tart cherries are perfect when dried.  They make a great, healthful snack any time.  Any fruit from Michigan is excellent in taste and texture.

review/text: These cherries are great!  I'm a lover of anything cherry and the dried version is no exception!  Moist and not too sweet these little antioxident wonders came delivered to my doorstep right on time and in perfect condition.  They taste like cherry pie without the crust.  Yes, they have sugar but not too much for my taste and are a wonderful snack when something sweet is required.  They came in a single bag that I emptied into a jar for easy access and I must have chosen well as they're all gone already!  A great deal and a great product; I highly recommend them!

review/summary: Exceptional Value, Even Better Quality
review/text: I bought these cherries as a way to combat my cravings for sugar, in a healthy way. Within several days I was hooked. The best part about the cherries is the texture - just enough firmness without seeming dry. My family loves the product too - my husband mixes it with his morning granola, some chocolate chips and seeds. The result - a snack so delicious our neighbor's kids asked if they could take it home after they tried some.<br /><br />Another point is the price. According to my research, at the moment when this review was written, they cost about 2 times less than comparable brands that carry dried cherries. Most regular grocery stores don't carry dried cherries most of the year, so you have to go to a health food store, where a small packet will run you 12 dollars, that is almost 2 pounds worth of these cherries! It's also great that Amazon runs a Subscribe and Save special, because it makes it easier and less expensive to enjoy this wonderful product.

review/text: A lot for the money:  My friend makes a wonderful cherry bread, and these made the best she's ever made. We don't live convenient to a good source of dried fruit, so buying in bulk is great for us. If you love cherries, the flavor is excellent, and is not hindered by over-sweetening or by additives. A great way to add fruit in your diet. These do come in one large bag, so we divided them into convenient quantities in freezer bags and froze part of themThese cherries have a delicious flavor, and make a wonderful snack or addition to trail mix or breakfast cereal. The quality of the fruit is uniformly high, and the sunflower oil to keep them from sticking together works great.

Amazon.com replaced the package with no questions asked and only charged me for the initial package that was stolen. I would use Amazon.com again and have since purchased other items.

review/text: We gave these a try based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  The sweet tartness is every bit as good as others have described.  To appreciate what a great deal this 4 pound box is, compare the price with what you would normally pay for the much smaller packages typically found in grocery stores or health food co-ops.  This is definitely one of those instances where buying in quantity is a much cheaper option.  We plan to order more of these cherries and will try other dried fruit from Traverse Bay as well.

review/summary: Dried Tart Cherries from the Cherry Capital of the World!
review/text: My first experience with dried tart cherries was when I went to visit a friend from Traverse City, Michigan about ten years ago.  As a teenager, she had worked in the cherry plant removing pits from the fruit, not uncommon for natives of the Cherry Capital.  She took me down to Meijers to buy this exact box of dried tart cherries to carry home on the plane as a special treat.<br /><br />Then a few years ago, I began buying cherries at Trader Joe's and they became a pantry staple for me. Once I realized my friend could get them on sale at Meijers and ship them to me for a significant savings and slight quality advantage over the ones I had been buying, I asked her to do that several times.  It never occurred to me to look for them on Amazon where the cost is about the same as having them shipped from Traverse City and I won't have to bother my friend.<br /><br />Normally I do not buy sweetened fruit of any kind but the slight amount of sugar is necessary due to the tartness of the cherries, much as lemonade or cranberry juice must be sweetened, and it is completely unnoticeable.  A slight bit of oil is also required to keep them from turning into a solid mass of moist chewy goodness!<br /><br />A few of these are great in smoothies, but not too many, as the flavor is very intense.  I also enjoy them in oatmeal and cold cereals, with milk chocolate, and out-of-hand as a snack.  Once, after carelessly mistaking them for raisins and adding them to scones, I got a very pleasant surprise!  They are great in rice pudding, cr&egrave;me br�l&eacute;e, ice cream, and chicken salad.<br /><br />A wonderful one-dish lunch or light summer supper is "Barley, Bacon and Avocado Salad with Roasted Chicken", but with these dried tart cherries added.  The recipe is easy to find on the internet.<br /><br />If you ever have the chance to go to Traverse City to see the cherry blossoms or the fall leaves up on the peninsula, please take advantage of the opportunity as you will surely enjoy it.  Now if I could just get Honeybell tangelos from Amazon, I'd be set!

review/text: You heard me correctly.  These are the best dried cherries ever to touch my taste buds and make a party in my mouth.  I have tried dried cherries in the store and they are too sweet and not sour enough.  Traverse Bay dried cherries taste like a cherry should taste, tart and sweet.  The perfect balance.  They keep me coming back for more.  I just eat them by the handful and have never had them last long enough to make it into a baked good or trail mix.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7LVKY">Traverse Bay Dried Cherries, 4-Pound Box</a>  After suffering with a stiff and painful shoulder and not wanting another cortisone shot I ordered Traverse Bay dried cherries not expecting to see much improvement.  I was wrong!  Within 7-10 days I realized that I didn't have the constant, nagging pain and I hadn't taken an aspirin or Aleve for nearly a week.  The change and improvement was subtle but definite.  And all that time I just thought I was enjoying some of the best dried cherries I'd ever tasted.  I put them in oatmeal, yogurt, quick breads, sauce for roast chicken, or just pop a few plain as a great, easy snack.  The price is right, the delivery was timely, and, if Traverse Bay keeps their quality well controlled and dependable, they certainly have a winner with these cherries.  About 15 or so a day seems to work just fine and they keep me away from the candy snacks - and that's really worth it!  I highly recommend them.
