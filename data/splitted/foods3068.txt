review/summary: The only truffles I've ever really liked!
review/text: I've had MANY different types, including Godiva, belgian stuff, etc. and these are really the only ones that I like.  I don't know what it is, but these are AMAZING!  Just the right consistency, not too sugary, not too bitter, very rich, not quite like fudge, but not crumbly, either.  Great stuff!  You might want to check out Costco, who also carries this stuff.

review/text: Absolutely delicious, rich, cocoa-coated chocolate drops.  Smooth texture, devine flavor, melt-in-your-mouth good!  These are a great bargain at 2 lbs.  There are 2 foil bags in the box and they last well.  There's no comparison to ordinary chocolate.  Just superb!

review/summary: Don't Waste Your Money
review/text: These "natural truffles" are a real travesty of chocolate. Absolutely disgusting. Want to know why the package doesn't display the word "chocolate" anywhere? Because they're not legally allowed to. These "truffles" do not fit the Food and Drug Administration's legal definition of chocolate. I'm not joking. These things are composed entirely of palm oil with a light dusting of cocoa powder. Cocoa powder, aka "cocoa solids", do not contain cocoa butter as does chocolate liquor, and do not satisfy the definition of chocolate. These are a substandard imitation of true chocolate, which is readily apparent in their similarity in consistency to Crisco. The reason they are made with palm oil is because it is significantly cheaper than cocoa butter. It's a cheapness you can taste, definitely. Believe me, I am no connoisseur of chocolate, and no purist by any means. They're just plain bad. Hell, a Hershey's bar is less fake than these.

review/summary: Wonderful with port wine
review/text: I was introduced to this product at a Christmas party.  A local beverage distributor brought a selection of wines for party guests to sample. He also brought a box of these chocolates for us to eat with the port wine he served after dinner.  I was very impressed and had to find some of these chocolates to share with my guests.  These chocolates have a rich chocolate flavor that makes other chocolate seem tasteless.  I don't recommend eating the whole box at a sitting, but eating one or two with a glass of fine port wine puts a wonderful finish on any special occassion.

review/summary: Truffles to die for!
review/text: These truffles are absolutely decadent! I am coming back for more after already ordering 5 boxes. After tasting them, I am going to hand them out at Christmas to everyone I know. I am not real crazy about the packaging(nothing wrong with packaging- just my personal preferance), so I am going to fancy them up a bit in some nicely decorated canisters (this way I can sneak a few out for myself). The truffles themselves look and taste as if they were bought in a high end chocolatier shop.

review/summary: BEST truffles I've eaten!
review/text: Received a box of the Truffettes for Christmas from one of my husband's business partners (as a family gift!) and kept one of the bags in the fridge with the second bag ziplocked in the pantry. They are so rich, smooth and melty that we'd eat one a day as a special treat after dinner. Another review noted that they thought the chocolates bitter because of the cocoa dusting, which is true. But the dusting is a complement and perfect counterpoint to the sweet, rich truffle itself. It makes the truffle all the more delectable. I'm so glad I found them available online. My recommendation is that you bite through the cocoa dusting and let it melt in your mouth slowly. Mmmmmm.

review/summary: "I want what SHE's having"
review/text: Someone gave our office a box of this chocolate at Christmas time. The box sat over a shelf with a light under it and it softened a bit. I noticed it, being a chocolate lover, and I was the first to opon the bag inside. I managed to extract a piece of soft warm chocolate and tried it. My knees went weak, my eyes rolled back in my head. I wanted to run off with the entire box and live with it on a tropical island. Once opened,  we were all amazed at this product and couldn't stop making reference to our reactions to tasting it. One woman said her reaction reminded her of the quote from When Harry Met Sally "I want what SHE's having". Don't make me say more, it's that good.

review/summary: High Shipping?  Buy More!
review/text: I tasted it at a friend's place and could not wait to place my order.  The chocolate is absolutely the best. The shipping and handling cost is absolutely terrible,  but there is a way to offset it.  For every extra package, the charge is only $1.50 more.  So, I bought more packages to make the shipping and handling cost more reasonable, I bought 4 Kg (i.e. 8.8 lbs), and in average, I paid about $4 per 2.2 lb.  With this price, it is not so bad any more, and I also got a good excuse to order more.  These chocolates make excellent gifts, and the extra packages could be used for the holidays.  The only thing I need to worry about now is how to burn off those extra calories.  BTW, I have absolutely no affiliation with the vendor.

I found that out after I had placed my order here, unfortunately.  And when they did arrive, they were completely melted, because the delivery person left them out on the porch.  As far as flavor goes, most people that tried them thought they were bitter.

Out of all the candy we had at Christmas time, my 3 boys enjoyed these the most. When their friends come over now I hear them asking for "those truffles. Do you guys have any more?" My kids don't eat a lot of sweets but they have commented several times to me on how good these truffles were. I will certainly buy them again as long as I can find them available to order. In fact, I am going to order a few boxes right now for Valentine's Day as gifts for my sons.

These things, while they'll satisfy a sweet tooth, are NOT chocolate.  Search the box; you won't see the word "chocolate" anywhere.  They are made of vegetable oil flavored with some cocoa.  Try a Teuscher's Champagne Truffle, and then tell me if these vegetable oil balls are still "the best truffle".  Not even close.  Not even in the same universe as a real truffle.

review/text: I don't often dole out positive reviews, but I have to say - Costco carried these for a time in 2006, and they were the best chocolate I've ever had.  They are a perfect bite-size, with a soft, creamy, slightly powdery texture, and a perfect balance of sweet with a tinge of salty.  Usually chocolate for me is too cloying (and the really dark stuff too bitter) - they have achieved some incomprehensibly immaculate balance here of chocolate with which I could never get fed up.  Get some!

review/text: After reading some earlier reviews I was very pleased when I recieved my order so promptly and in perfect condition.  I guess the cold weather may have also helped my chocolates not to melt, considering the packaging isn't the greatest (they are not individually wrapped).<br /><br />The taste is great, so rich and not overbearingly sweet.  Some friends came over today and tried a couple of pieces.  They are going to order some from Amazon as well now!

review/text: Product arrived 3/12/2012. Item is marked 3/10/2012 with what I can only assume is the expiration date. Product not intended for U.S. as it has Arabic, Greek and Chinese lettering. There is some English but its a bit hidden. Not that the text needs to be English but combining this with the expiration leads me to believe the candy isn't intended for U.S. market. Is there a law against that, selling expired goods imported from another country? This product was packaged by Amazon LLC.<br /><br />I don't want to hurt the product itself with a low rating. Its probably good stuff, but I'll never know because Amazon sold me expired goods.

Unfortunately, these are really mediocre.  There is no luscious chocolate flavor--very bland.  Even my 12 year old who loves chocolate said these were "just okay".<br /><br />I'll have to continue my search for delicious chocolate truffles elsewhere.

review/text: When the truffles came I opened them right away.  They came quite fast.  They were in 2 packages inside the box.  They were partially melted, especially on the top.  Some were all running together.  I quickly put the package in the fridge.  The next day when I opened it again, they had stayed in the melted condition, but pieces could be cut from them to eat.  I am glad I ordered them for myself and not as a gift.  I would have been very embarassed.  Obviously someone had left the package sit in a hot spot for too long of a time.  Perhaps there should be a warning on the outside of the package about this danger.  Nancy L. Bowie

review/text: These truffles are great.  They are also sold at Costco (at least the one in UT).  They are also sold and repackaged as Gustaux brand truffles, which cost more (I know because the picture of the truffles are the exact same on both boxes and same with the nutrition facts).  So just to let you know that if you shop around you may find them cheaper.  I first discovered them at the Annual Chocolate Show in New York City being sold as Gustaux chocolates at a price of 22 pieces for [...].  Much more expensive than both Amazon and Costco.

Costco was selling these two pound packages for $10 or was it two for $10 ?  I don't recall but I got two.  I took the one I hadn't opened and returned it and through the mostly uneaten package away.  I should have checked the ingredients first.  Good chocolates or any candy for that matter will never have vegetable oil as the main ingredient.

review/summary: Probably my favorite combo pack...
review/text: First off, you won't find "tasting notes" in this as I don't have the developed palate of a wine connoiser.  My take on coffee/wine is - I just know what I like.<br /><br />I happen to love Tully's coffee. This pack is a staple in my house for personal use and for guests.  You get four flavors (French, Italian, House, Kona) of K-cups.  All are on the bolder side of the spectrum, but I wouldn't say they were extra-bold.<br /><br />I like coffee with a punch in the morning as I often only have time for one cup before I leave.  The Italian or French are good for that.  They are the boldest of the four flavors included.  Nice flavor, strong, clean coffee taste without a an odd/burned aftertaste.<br /><br />Kona has a typical (to me) Kona flavor.  Nothing super special, but a good cup of coffee!  I do tend to reserve these for my sister as she loves them. :)<br /><br />House is probably the mildest of the bunch.  A good cup for evening use (or second cup of the day) when you don't need that big coffee BANG.<br /><br />I was worried that when Green Mountain took over Tully's K-cup business that I would have have to find another "go to" K-cup.  I've been quite pleasantly surprised that the coffee hasn't seemed to change.

review/summary: Tully's K-Cup Variety Pack is an Excellent Choice
review/text: This variety pack isnt filled with k-cups you will never use. If you like bold coffee, this is the variety pack for you. Then pick your favorite and buy just that one or buy both. I buy my favorite, Tullys Kona, and this variety pack so I can mix it up a little.

review/summary: Not as advertised
review/text: This would have been great had it been the right combination.....it is advertised as French, Kona, Italian, and House Blend.  It is actually French, Italian, House, and Breakfast blend.....unfortunate because I don't like Breakfast Blend.

review/summary: Tully's K-Cup House Collection
review/text: I placed an order at Amazon for a combination of Tully K-Cups. I found it to be one of the best tasting collections I have tried. The coffee seems to be more robust and stronger than many. The Italian K-Cups were among the best Italian K-Cups I have tried.

review/summary: Tully's is One of the Best for K-Cups
review/text: Tully's is without a doubt one of my favorite K-Cups. I'd say my top two are Tully's House Blend and Newman's Own.<br /><br />This particular package comes with House, Kona, Italian and French Roast. I'm not a fan of the French Roast myself, but I like the other three (and my girlfriend like the French), so it work's out well. None of the blends are too strong.<br /><br />If you buy this package though, make sure you realize there are four different coffee-types included here. In my haste to get my K-Cups I accidentally purchased this collection instead of just a box of House Blend. It wasn't too bad of a mistake since the collection is good, but since the House is my favorite, I prefer to stick with it.

review/summary: Did Not Include Kona as shown
review/text: My husband loves the Kona and I am always looking for a little variety.  I thought this would be perfect, except that when I opened the box, there was no Kona.  Instead there was Tullys Breakfast Blend.  Yes, there was the French Roast.  Yes, there was the Italian Roast.  Yes, there was Tully's special House Blend.  But the 4th variety was NOT Kona, it was Breakfast Blend.  I purchased this from Amazon, and believed the photo.  I should have read the details a little better.  We are very disappointed.

review/summary: Not as describe
review/text: This product was totally different from the description. Boy was I disappointed in Amazon. I am a big fan of the Kona, Italian Roast, and French Roast was excited to get them package together for a reasonable price. The description was very clear listing the flavors and how many of each was included. I purchased two so I would get four boxes total. They were totally different. I received boxes of mainly housse and breaksfast blend with a few italian and french roast thrown in. There was no Kona at all.

review/text: I do enjoy Tully's coffee and think they provide an excellent product, however they do not tell you the blends in this box.  I purchased this 2 pack based on another customer review and with the impression I was getting some Kona in the box.  Big disappointment when I opened box and there were none.  I received House, Breakfast, Italian and French roasts.  I will have to say please let customers know what is in box being shipped.

review/summary: Too much of a good thing
review/text: It seems that every time I reached for a K-cup from this variety pack, it was a French Roast. This coffee is truly an Extra Bold - a bit too much for me.<br />I prefer the Diedrich French Roast any day.

review/summary: Labeling is misleading
review/text: The description for this item is "Tully's Coffee House Collection for Keurig Brewers". The key word that I was interested in was "Collection" because I wanted an assortment of mild, medium, and dark roasts to meet the particular tastes of many people. There was not a "Collection" of flavors in the package. There was only one and it was Extra Dark. Not many people are like Extra Dark. Since the package was opened and put out for my guests, I will be looking for someone to trade with. My fault for not reading more carefully.

review/summary: Tully's OK, but not as strong as others I like
review/text: I prefer strong bold coffees that yield more than the average K-cups.<br />Out of the 4 0ptions, I liked Italian the best at the lower yield setting. At this setting, I thought French tasted burnt, and Kona and House were too weak.

review/summary: The Best Dark Roast Variety Pack Ever
review/text: I've tried quite a few K-cup brands over the past few years, and Tully's Coffee House Collection really has the best dark roast blends out of them all.  When I first purchased this variety pack in 2010, it came with French Roast, Italian Roast, Kona Blend, and House Blend.  Now, Breakfast Blend is substituted for Kona Blend, and it's STILL good!<br /><br />I really don't know what the other reviewers were thinking when they gave this product a one-star rating due to the lack of Kona Blend.  Get over yourselves and enjoy the Breakfast Blend!!  Now that Amazon has changed the product image, you can't blame Amazon for false advertising, so all your one-star "no Kona!" reviews are now obsolete.  Serves you right!  Be happy with the inclusion of Breakfast Blend and learn to love it!  I certainly do!

review/summary: Great taste poor packaging
review/text: Miracle Whip is hands down the best spread to use in sandwiches.  Period.  My complaint is with the packaging.  They put regular Miracle Whip in a squeeze bottle.  It is too thick.  Therefore, it is always difficult to get it all out of the bottle.  I have to water it down, just a bit.  It takes away from the convenience of having a squeeze bottle in the first place, if I have to dilute it and mess with it any way.<br /><br />3.5 stars
