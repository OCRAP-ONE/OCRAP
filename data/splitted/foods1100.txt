review/summary: Soothing, Rich and Subtle
review/text: This hearty full flavored tea is soul satisfying and will almost make you sigh with its depth of flavor and its subtle kiss of lemon. This Higgins & Burke tea is soothing to wrap yourself around and snuggle up to or to get you up and out and going.<br /><br />It's a perfect tea to share with friends for a comfort talk or a deep discussion.<br />It's a perfect companion as you ponder the fate of the planet.<br /><br />If more people drank this tea there would be no more war or crime or divorce.<br />It's that good.

review/summary: Comparable to Tazo Zen Tea, but not as good
review/text: This green tea is flavored with lemon grass, lemon balm herb, and verbena leaves, making it similar to Tazo Zen Tea, a green tea flavored using lemon verbena, spearmint, and natural flavors.  These are flavored green teas not intended for the green tea aficionado, but for the casual drinker.  In any case, although I usually consume plain green tea, I do occasionally enjoy a cup of Tazo Zen, hot or iced, in the evening.<br /><br />Since I enjoy the Tazo product, I should enjoy this, too; right?  Well, if a green tea is going to be flavored, it should have a brilliant, refreshing taste.  While I would not refuse a cup of Higgins & Burke Green Tea if it were offered to me, I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to drink it.  Its flavors are less than subtle; they are just plain dull.  In a word, this is a boring cup of tea.<br /><br />While the Higgins & Burke product does deserve credit for not using the 'natural flavors' included in the Tazo brand, there is simply not enough flavor for the finished product to work.  The lemon grass, lemon balm, and verbena overwhelm the delicate flavor of the green tea leaves without offering enough flavor to stand on their own.

review/text: I have been drinking all kinds of tea  for 50 years.I found this tea to be bitter and just not taste very good. The flavor  was  not very pleasing  to  me at all. It  tasted like a chai tea gone bad!! Green teas I have had do not have any spicey taste to them, they have  a smooth, light  pleasing flavor.

review/summary: Green tea with an unexpectedly delightful taste twist
review/text: Wasn't expecting much from this premium green tea. Although I drink tea almost daily and enjoy a wide range of standard brands (Bigelow, Twinings, etc.; some product from Chinatown, as well as tea from companies with more pricey and custom blends such as Marriage Freres, Republic of Tea, Harney & Sons, and some blends from online tea merchants), I can't say I'm an "expert." I just know what I like and enjoy.<br /><br />And I really enjoyed this tea, once I stopped expecting it to taste like a typical green tea. As others have noted, this is not a generic-type green tea. Thanks to the addition of lemon grass, lemon balm herb and verbena leaves, this is, to my palate, a more flavorful and "spicey" green tea.<br /><br />Now if you aren't familiar with, or don't like lemon or verbena, you may not care for this green tea. But if you do like either lemon or verbena, this is a delight. For me, it's a nice addition to my collection of "special" teas for relaxation and downtime...and bad weather.<br /><br />You can't always tell from the aroma as to whether or not you'll like a tea. But if you like that first whiff when you open the bag, you're generally on the track to a positive tasting experience. Not only did I like the aroma (I was even thinking "Gee, can I put these in my closet to keep it fresh?") but it smelled really fresh. For those of you who don't drink tea very often, you may not recognize the difference between old/stale teas and those that are younger and fresher. (Real people word choices here. As I said, I'm not a tea expert so I don't have the specific vocabulary to describe this aspect.)<br /><br />This product has the hallmark of a good tea: You can drink it "as is" without the benefit of any sweetner, lemon or milk. But some of you may prefer adding to it. You can also enjoy it without having to eat anything else. (Some teas just seem to "demand" crackers or something to go with them.)<br /><br />If I close my eyes while sipping, I can imagine being in one of the better tea parlors here in New York City (Think Bosie, Harney & Sons or Radiance in midtown). It's that kind of flavor but the cost is far more affordable than the by-the-ounce prices at such venues for their green teas.<br /><br />Haven't had a chance to drink it with a variety of food or snack items, but I suspect this could go with either moderately sweet or savory items.<br /><br />I also suspect this tea would be incredibly refreshing in hot weather when made as iced tea as its flavor has the lemony "fresh" bite I like in the summer and it would hold up with the addition of ice.<br /><br />A lot of people think you can't really get quality tea in a bag. And it's true that there is often a significant difference in the end product when you brew with a bag versus loose tea. However, in this case, I think the bag holds its own.

review/text: This Higgins & Burke tea is pretty tasty.  The Lemon Balm, Lemon Grass, and Verbena work well with the green tea, taking away the 'dry' aspects of green tea and making it a bit more 'green leafy' and lemony.<br /><br />I liked it as-is.  Then again, I generally don't add anything to any green tea.  Not sweetener nor milk.<br /><br />I think you're more likely to like this Green Tea mix if you don't set your tastebuds for straight green tea as the overall flavor is radically different.  But if you are looking for something really pleasant to have after dinner, or along with a snack, this might be the thing.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/text: I drink green tea almost every day and I always stick with the traditional ones. I don't like other flavors in my tea. Personally, this one tastes horrible. I just can't stand the combination of lemon balm and verbena and green tea. Well, if you want to try something new, you may want to consider this product.

review/text: Higgins & Burke Green Tea blend really makes a very nice cup of tea.  I usually drink my green tea without adding anything, and by itself this has a good flavor, the lemon balm and verbena adding a nice hint almost like mild mint and lemon.  I stirred a bit of honey into one cup, which brought out even more flavor.<br /><br />I'll certainly buy this brand again, for its smooth, clean taste.

review/summary: For the tea lover who likes tea with a small bite
review/text: Green tea is smooth and very mild with just a hint of flavor. This tea has a definite flavor. I put a tea bag in my Mr Coffee and allowed the water to flow through. It started off as a medium strength tea and then the lemon grass kicked in. I would say it is equivalent in strength to a cinnamon spiced tea. Lemon grass has a slight bitter taste compared with just adding lemon to tea so you will have to try it in order to find out if its your cup of tea. Although advertised as slightly sweet, I did not have that impression. It came across as an herbal tea which it does claim to be.<br /><br />The next time I allowed the tea bag to sit for 5-10 minutes in a cup of tap water. Then I microwaved it until it was hot. Completely different taste. Now it was mild, smooth, and had less of the lemon grass flavor.

review/summary: Wonderful Tea!
review/text: I am a bit of a tea buff who drinks tea all throughout the day. This is one great green tea. I like to steep my teas longer than usual to get more medicinal properties in my drinks. This causes most green teas to have a bit of a bitter tastes, but I did not find that to be the case with this tea. It maintained its great flavor, even when steeping it for longer periods of time. And the flavor is definitely great! This green tea also has lemon grass and lemon balm added, which gives it a very subtle lemon taste, but not overwhelming by any means. It is just enough to tell that it is there, no more. To be honest, this is one of the best tasting green teas I have experienced. I highly recommend this tea to anyone who enjoys tea. You will not be disappointed. 5-Stars!! Love it!!<br /><br />Bohdi Sanders

review/summary: Smoother Than The Average Cup Of Green Tea
review/text: Being an avid green tea drinker, I usually buy what's on sale at the local grocery store.  Brands can vary from well-known to store labels, and boy, do their tastes vary.  In my estimation, Higgins & Burke green tea is top of the line.  Perhaps it's the inclusion of lemon grass, lemon balm and verbena that makes for a smoother flavor.  Maybe's it's the way Higgins & Burke makes it.  All I know is it tastes much better than most of the brands I've tried.<br /><br />I checked the Higgins & Burke's website to see if this green tea is available locally.  The FAQ page directs you to an 800 number for further assistance or suggests buying from Amazon.  I don't usually buy food items online, but may have to start after sampling this tea.  It's a little bit higher priced than the local sale-priced tea, but not by much.  And maybe the saying, "you get what you pay for" really is true when it comes to green tea.

review/text: This tea has a very comforting smell and tastes good. I'm really enjoying the cup I am having tonight before I go to bed. There is lemon grass in it but it's very subtle as is the verbena. The lemon grass which adds a nice light tang which gets a bit stronger while the tea steeps. Still, the tang never seems to get overpowering in my opinion. Seems to be a very pleasing tea all around that I feel most tea drinkers would enjoy.

review/summary: Subtle green tea and lemon flavor
review/text: I drink a lot of tea, but somehow have never found a green tea that I like.  The ones that are available locally are pretty average, often with a bit of an astringent flavor.  I try to drink them because they're supposed to be good for me, but many times I reach past the green teas for a black, white, or rooibos tea.<br /><br />That changed today.  I really like this tea.  While there are polyphenols in this tea (165 mg per cup, according to the package,) the astringent bite of green tea seems to be missing, even though I brewed the tea for over three minutes.  There's a subtle lemon flavor from the lemongrass, lemon balm, and presumably the verbena in the tea.  It makes for a balanced, comforting flavor.<br /><br />I've been drinking this tea hot with no sweetener, and iced with a little bit of agave sweetener.  I think it's a simple, relaxing cup of tea.<br /><br />If you care, Higgins & Burke is a member of Ethical Tea Partnership, which works to "create a thriving tea industry that is socially just and environmentally sustainable" and works to improve "the lives of tea workers and their environment."

With the colder weather coming I suspect I will be enjoying it more.<br /><br />This green tea also stands up fine to a bit of ice to drink cold, not something I can say about any of the other green teas I have tried, mostly because I wouldn't have even considered it with them.  I am going to have to get some more, soon.

review/summary: Clean, invigorating, fresh-tasting tea!
review/text: I never was much of a fan of tea until about five or so years ago, when I started seeing the value it offers beyond being something to soothe your stomach when you're sick, or something hot to drink that's put on your table at a nice Chinese restaurant. And, honestly, that's exactly how I thought of green tea, especially, up until recently: it was just a substitute for water in a nice Chinese restaurant.<br /><br />This Higgins & Burke tea is something I could get addicted to as a late-night mug of warm relaxation before I head to bed. It's refreshing, and fresh-tasting; warming, with just a subtle flavor - enough flavor to wake up your taste buds just a little, but not so much that they're overpowered. I brew my cups at about the halfway point with these bags - one minute, thirty seconds - and I never re-use them. I don't want the bitterness that can come from overbrewing tea to ruin the pleasant experience that I have drinking this (or, really, any other teas).<br /><br />After trying this flavor in the Higgins & Burke line of offerings, I'd be happy to add this to my regular rotation of grocery purchases from Amazon. Great taste at a good price! You can't beat that!

review/summary: Love it Iced and Unsweetened
review/text: I am on a never-ending quest to replace unhealthy beverages with healthier ones, and unsweetened green tea is one of the great saviors according to the experts. This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061IUKDM">Higgins & Burke Green Tea, 20-Count (Pack of 6)</a> is becoming one of my favorites. I drink it mostly iced. Nothing else added. Just tea, water and ice. Being on the stingy side of stingy, I am able to milk two brews out of each tea bag (sachet). The second one is obviously not as strong, but it is still good enough as an icy cold drink.<br /><br />This tea also includes lemon grass, lemon balm herb and verbana leaves, so it gives it a slightly not-more-of-the-same taste. The box says it has 165mg of polyphenols per serving.<br /><br />The outer packaging is elegant enough for gift giving. The box information is written in English and in French, adding to its giftiness. One box has 20 individually sealed tea bags. The top left corner of each tea bag is slightly pre-cut so you can open it faster. The individually wrapped tea bags look nice and sturdy enough that you can give to your friends or coworkers to try out on their own when they go home.<br /><br />There are two ways to take the tea bags out of the bag. Just opening the box, or using the "advanced" built-in perforated mechanism. It's easier to just open the box :)<br /><br />This is priced as an everyday-luxury type of item. One can obviously beat the price at warehouse stores with near lifetime supply quantities of generic tea. This perhaps can serve as a special occasions type of a tea if you are in a household of tea drinkers.<br /><br />Five stars without factoring in the price. Four stars with the price factored in.

review/text: The tea that I normally drink <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LAQ">Celestial Seasonings Authentic Green Tea, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, and despite the fact that Celestial Seasonings recently changed their formula much to the dismay of many reviewers, I still prefer that tea to this Higgins and Burke tea.  I find the Higgins and Burke to be almost identical in taste, however a touch more bitter, which can be offset by adding a little honey or sugar, but I prefer to avoid that as much as possible.  Also, this tea is more expensive by quite a bit.  My best guess on the reason for that is that each tea bag is individually wrapped, and has the string on it to make it easy to get the bag out of your cup.  For me, I personally don't need the tea individually wrapped, and I'm fine with using a fork to fish the tea bag out of the water.  If your opinions on those two issues vary, then you may want to consider purchasing this Higgins and Burke.  Overall, this is a great tasting tea, just not quite as great as my regular Celestial Seasonings, so I'm going to give it 4 stars.

The Higgins & Burke Company has been around since 1912 and lists the company in Toronto, Ontario Canada and in Ft Worth Texas.  (I am betting it started in Toronto, because the company has "LTDafter its name and has french on the packaging.)  The package says it is all natural.  Ingredients are listed as: premium sencha green tea, lemon grass, lemon balm herb, verbena leaves (in the order listed).  There are 165 mg of Polyphenols per serving.  They advise you to steep/soak the bag in hot water for 1 - 3 minutes.<br /><br />I personally believe green tea is very good for you and I try to drink at least 20 oz a day, unsweetened.  I have also found it to be energizing.<br /><br />I attended a lecture on teas and was told that 2 cups a day of quality green tea will generally keep cancer away.  I was also told to use only natural sweeteners to preserve the healing qualities of the teas.  The lady defined natural sweeteners as honey, agave nectar, natural brown sugars, such as turbino, or stevia.  She said the imitation stuff in the pink, blue, and yellow packets was not considered natural sweeteners.

review/summary: Good tea
review/text: This is a nice green tea. I've had some better ones, but for the price it's good. Mighty Leaf is better, but much pricier. For the normal teas, Twinnings, Stash, etc., this is comparable. I didn't really notice the lemongrass flavors, although that may be in part because I usually drink a Green Chai tea from Stash, which has many flavors. So by comparison, this was plain green tea.

review/summary: Great, refreshing green tea w/hint of lemon
review/text: Don't order this if you are expecting it to taste like an everyday, standard green tea.  Do order this if you like green tea and want a refreshing tea drink.  With the addition of lemongrass, lemon balm, and verbena leaves, this is a fabulous step up from your run-of-the-mill green tea.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with lemongrass, lemon balm, or verbena, think of a light spritz of citrus.  Just something to lighten your green tea.  It's perfect for something warm before bedtime or (my favorite!) chilled to have as iced tea.<br /><br />To make the iced tea, use two teabags to 8 cups of boiling water.  Let steep based on desired strength of tea.  Remove tea bags and let liquid come down to room temperature.  Once the temp. has lowered, pop your pitcher of tea in the fridge.  Let chill.  Pour. Yum!

review/summary: A  Different Green Tea
review/text: I like a good cup of tea, but I'm no tea expert, so I can't bore you with a bunch of "tea snobbery." For me, it's usually something like, "Hey, this ain't half bad."<br /><br />I enjoy a variety of teas, but green tea is usually not one of them. To me, most are weak and flavorless. This one is different. I don't know if it is the tea itself or the addition of the lemongrass, lemon balm herb, and verbena leaves, but I like the overall flavor. It also has sufficient body. Mrs. Boilermate, who also likes a good cuppa, had a similar reaction. I'd add this one to the rotation.

review/summary: Green Tea that's less Green than I Expected, but Decent
review/text: I enjoy drinking and brewing tea, though I'm no kind of expert on the beverage.  My cabinet is full of various brands of tea and all kinds of flavors.  It's safe to say I don't shop for Lipton or store brand orange pekoe when I can help it.  Generally I like green tea for days when I'm feeling a little under the weather, or when I'm eating Asian cuisine.  When this came up on Vine, I figured, what the heck?<br /><br />This is a perfectly serviceable green tea blend from Higgins & Burke.  The packaging is fairly pedestrian (no fancy tricorner bags, etc.), but done well enough to keep the tea bags fresh until use.  The main thing is that this isn't quite green tea as the label says.  It's green tea with lemongrass, lemon balm and verbena leaves.  Now, that's not to say it's bad.  It's green tea with a little kick to it, an added set of flavors that blend well.  But if you were expecting simply green tea, it could be a disappointment.  I like it fine in a mug with a little honey, though if I'm in the mood for real quality green tea, I won't have this as my "go-to".<br /><br />On the plus side, it makes a great iced tea.  I brewed up a batch with some mint leaves and have been enjoying the treat in this unseasonably warm Spring.  All in all, if you have a green tea you already love, this probably won't change your opinion, but it's a nice blend for those looking for something a little different.  And great if you want a green tea for making iced tea!<br /><br />Happy Drinking! ^_^ Shanshad

review/summary: Average Tea, Nice Extras
review/text: I was prepared to not really like this. Green tea usually does not take to being flavored very well. This one surprised me in not only being drinkable but tasty.  The lemongrass and lemon balm are things I already flavor some teas with and verbena is often even infused by itself.<br /><br />It says Premium Sencha Green Tea.  This was not the case in my box. It was average at best. Like any green tea it likes water that has cooled a bit after boiling (195F max). It gets the stereotypical bitter and 'burnt' flavors you get from using hotter water. It was not bad tea, just not even a mid end loose leaf Sencha you could get from a number of places.  The extra flavors cover this surprisingly well though.<br /><br />Two teabags had the slightly soapy taste you get when verbena is improperly handled. I sent a note to the company that it was noticed and they gave a very friendly ad rapid reply. I can only hope they learn from the errors as they go along.  Which lead me to look at their other teas and offerings. It looks like a decent company that is expanding.  I hope with some experience they become one of the more ethical tea importers the profess to wanting to be.<br /><br />Right now this isn't one I'd have as a staple in my pantry.<br />If I saw it in a restaurant I would pick it over Tzao or Numi for sure.<br /><br />Good if you want some green tea with a little different taste.<br />If you're used to loose leaf higher end teas, you'll be disappointed.

review/summary: Green tea with a little bit of extra
review/text: I am personally a big fan of tea. I have been drinking tea ever since a kid. That said, I am also someone who doesn't like to add sugars to my tea as I think it takes the taste away. I enjoyed this green tea as it has a little bit of extra in there. To me, it almost tastes a little bit grassy. Now, that might not be something you might enjoy but the taste was something that I enjoyed.<br /><br />My husband also loved the tea and he is someone who likes to put sugars and honey into his tea. He actually didn't put any extras in this when enjoying the tea. This is going to be a preference thing where some will like it and others don't. For me, I enjoyed the tea quite a bit.

review/text: I liked this tea, for what it was.<br />The box says "GREEN TEA", and it doesn't mention any other flavors ON THE FRONT OF THE BOX, what most people see and use to decide whether to grab the box off the shelf or not. Once you read the side of the box and/or ingredients, that's when you find out it has lemongrass and lemon balm.<br /><br />As a straight green tea, it's not. But for what it is, it has a soft, delicate lacy flavor that I rather like. It's even good iced.<br />I like that it has a dispenser tearout in the box, it sits nicely in my cabinet, upright and dispenses tea bags. So cute.

review/text: I'm impressed with this green tea.  Whether it's the specific type, or the addition of lemongrass, herbs or verbena leaves, it has a flavor different than most of the other green teas that I have tried.  It's very enjoyable and also steeps better and stronger than some of the others that I have tasted.  I like it freshly steeped, hot, with nothing added to it.  There is just a hint of lemon to it.<br /><br />In addition, the packaging is also 100% recycled (55% post-consumer), and the tea itself is 100 percent sourced and purchased under the Ethical Tea Partnership standards.

It has a light, refreshing flavor. She encouraged me to try it. Though it is a green tea, it doesn't have the almost grassy flavor I associate with green tea. Even as a non-tea drinker, I can appreciate it, and would drink it again. My daughter highly recommends this, as do I!

review/summary: Okay, but not spectacular
review/text: It's very hard to do green tea in a bag.  Green tea is so much less forgiving than black tea, breaking it up and putting it in a bag makes it so much harder to brew a good cup that isn't bitter.  On that note, I must give this product credit.  This tea brewed with no hint of bitterness (using a cooler temperature, as one would do for other green teas).  That said, this tea does have quite a strong lemongrass-lemon flavor, and that gives these tea bags some latitude.  I tasted much more citrus than I did green tea.  That's not necessarily bad, if that's what one wants.  The main issue I see is that this tea is marketed as straight green tea, when it's really a flavored product, first and foremost.  As flavored green tea in a teabag goes, this is okay, but it's not the best I've had.

review/summary: Smooth, Clean Taste - Not My Cup of Traditional Green Tea
review/text: First off, I love tea. I've had Lipton, Mighty Leaf, Tazo, Tetley, and when I have time I brew tea directly from tea leaves bought from Chinatown. I also drink it straight, with no sugar or milk. Compared to those brands, the Higgins & Burke Green Tea disappointed me. I like my Green Tea to be rich and deep, like Tazo Zen or China Green Tips. This tea has a smooth, clean taste (with hints of lemon and mint) but doesn't have a particularly strong "green tea" flavor, thanks to the addition of lemongrass, lemon balm herb and verbena leaves. I recommend you drink this with Thai food or anything spicy - it brings out the flavor more.<br /><br />I really wanted to like it more but I prefer a richer, darker green tea taste.

review/summary: Good green tea with hints of lemongrass
review/text: My true love is coffee, but that doesn't automatically mean I hate tea.  I drink quite a bit (even more as I've gotten older), especially mint and green teas.  Now, I'm no expert in teas, but this one was pretty decent.<br /><br />Opening the package is fairly easy and doesn't leave the box in shreds.  The tea bags were well constructed.  With other teas, I've accidentally ripped the string from the bag while opening the individual packages, but I never had that problem with these.  Also the string never broke off from the bags while steeping.<br /><br />The tea itself is pretty good.  The green tea itself is pretty predominant and flavorful, though you there are additional background tastes (must be the lemongrass and verbena leaves).  I drank sweetened with Nutra taste and unsweetened; I wasn't fond of the unsweetened variety, but I am not a fan of unsweetened tea in general.  Still, unsweetened was not a bad taste.<br /><br />It's definitely not a bad tea, and I rather liked it.  However, I noticed Amazon is selling in a 6-carton package that may be a bit too much to purchase for someone who is unsure.  If you really love your tea, check this one out.  If you just want straight up green tea, I would pass.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*

review/text: Following Tazo's lead, Higgins & Burke has decided to market as "green tea" a tea where the dominant flavors are lemon and lemongrass. It's not bad, but it's green tea for people who don't like green tea.<br /><br />Bag for bag, this tea costs nearly twice as much as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BNE">Bigelow's Green Tea</a>, which in my mind sets the bar for bagged green tea: a high-quality product that's almost ridiculously cheap. (Bigelow also offers a "Green Tea with Lemon" variety, which I haven't tried.) In short, I can't recommend Higgins & Burke's unexceptional offering.

review/summary: Half and Half
review/text: Each sip starts with a sharp citrus-y note from the lemon balm and lemongrass, followed by clear, strong Sencha, and rounded out with an earthy, herbal note from the verbena.  The tea has a crisp, refreshing flavor and is good hot or cold.  Both the lemon flavor and the tea are apparent on the palate.  Neither is dominant; they are equal.<br /><br />The tea is strong.  I brewed for two minutes at 180 degrees.  The color is a deep yellow, or more exactly, a pale amber.  The lemon herbs do overpower the Sencha's "seaweed" fragrance and taste, but the tea's brightness and sweetness are not diminished.<br /><br />I prefer less adulteration to tea's innate flavor and fragrance.  However, among flavored teas, I do think this is excellent.  There are no "natural" flavorings.  Each ingredient speaks for itself, and there is no off-flavor.<br /><br />Served hot with a bit of honey, this would soothe one's throat nicely.

review/text: I lived in Shanghai for almost five years, so I am used to high quality green tea.  And this tea has a very good flavor with a hint of spice I cannot identify. It is a very good taste. My only negative is the tea bag filters allow a tiny amount of the powdered fragments of the tea leaves to pass through. So if the tea is allowed time to settle, there is some residue at the bottom. I know this is purely cosmetic, but I don't like to see it. I usually make tea using 8 bags in a pitcher of 8 cups of water brought to 190 degrees F and soaked for about an hour as it cools off. You should not allow the water to come to a boil for the best brewing temperature.

review/summary: Just fine, couldn't detect lemon taste
review/text: Many people use green tea as an alternative to the more common black tea, feeling that the green offers health benefits. "Camellia sinensis" originates in China. It supposedly promotes weight loss, stimulating fat oxidation by boosting metabolic rate without increasing heart rate. In addition, it contains polyphenols which are claimed to be antioxidants, but it is not at all clear that scientists agree on this or whether, if so, they are useful to humans.<br /><br />So I steeped this teabag in eight ounces of hot but not boiling water for three minutes. The resulting brew was most pleasant, I think better than my usual attempts to brew looseleaf green tea because the time and amount were better controlled. Green tea becomes bitter if steeped too long. I could not taste the lemon grass, lemon balm herb or verbena at all.

review/summary: Converted even a coffee-drinker :-)
review/text: We are not huge green tea drinkers in our household, though I am aware of its health benefits. I have found that it can be difficult to find a green tea that I like that doesn't taste too...green. Seems silly, I know - but I'm used to black tea and some green teas can taste overwhelmingly like herbs. However, I have stepped up my search for a great green tea because my husband, a life-long coffee drinker, has begun drinking it at work every so often (when there is no coffee available). So I was curious to try this tea, particularly with the addition of the lemon flavor.<br /><br />When I first opened the envelope to take out the tea bag, I was impressed by how fresh the tea smelled. Some teas, even those packed in the envelopes, can smell almost stale when first opened. That was not the case here. I couldn't really smell much of the lemon though. However, when I added the teabag to the hot water, I could definitely smell the lemon. When we tasted it, the lemon taste was faint, but discernible. I tasted it with no sweetener, and would not be able to drink it that way - however, with just a little bit of sugar, it was absolutely delicious. In fact, my husband has not only said that he likes it better than the others he's tried BUT he has started hoarding the teabags so I can't drink them!<br /><br />I could easily see this being the go-to green tea for our household now that we've tried it. It is quite delicious!

review/summary: Bland and uninspired
review/text: I drink tea frequently and obsessively. At a minimum I drink 3 cups of tea per day and I prefer loose leaf tea over tea bags. In the mornings I opt for tea bags for efficiency and time. My morning teas alternate between Green Tea, English Breakfast, Earl Grey and Black Tea. As such, I am always tasting and trying new teas, especially the green tea variety. When I saw this tea offered, I jumped at the chance to get Higgins. But, I was highly disappointed.<br /><br />First, the taste is rather bland and weak. There is barely any flavor. I had a cup of tea whilst taking to a friend and during our conversation I noticed that I had finished the tea but had no memory of its flavors or qualities. I had no idea what I had drunk! It was the equivalent of drinking water. The only thing that comes across is hot water and some lemongrass flavor (see below re lemongrass). None of the green tea leaves flavor comes out. I opened up a tea bag and noticed that the leaves mix is rather powdery (no wonder there is barely any taste).<br /><br />Several reviewers (and the description) have mentioned that this tea has a lemon grass taste. Lemon grass is not something I use a lot but, thankfully, I had some lemon grass in my pantry. I tried it and ...the reviewers are very right. This tea has some lemon grass undertones.<br /><br />If you are looking for an very affordable and good tasting tea (in tea bag form), try Stash or even Lipton Pyramid Tea Bags. Something other than this.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pass. Money is better spent at better tea brands.

review/summary: A pleasant green tea
review/text: Where most green teas become bitter when steeped longer than the recommended time (1-3 minutes in this tea's case), Higgins & Burke's Green Tea got better the longer I steeped it. I found the flavor too light when I steeped it for 3 minutes, but when I forgot I was steeping the tea and left the bag in for about 10 minutes, it was quite good! I have since steeped the bags for anywhere from 3-10 minutes and found I preferred the flavor with a longer steep. After trying their green tea I will definitely be looking into their other teas as well.

review/summary: Light delicate flavor with a touch of lemon that shines though
review/text: Green tea is usually too light for my taste buds and I think it tastes like weak watered down tea. But this tea is great once I let it steep for about 3 minutes in hot water and I add a half teaspoon of sugar which enhances the lemon notes.  I recommend this green tea because the lemon adds to the flavor and brings out the best in the tea leaves which makes the tea taste bright and lively. I would love to try other flavors from this brand simply because this tea impressed me that much and I usually shy away from green teas and favor black teas but this one could convert me. It is yummy iced too!

review/text: I am a big tea drinker and have tried many, many brands this is my first time with this one. Higgin & Burke Green Tea makes for a nice refresing drink. As others have mentioned it dosent taste like your regular green which is fine for me. It's fine to drink alone no need to add anything-there is a hint of lemon to it so if your want that strong pure green tea tatse its not here. Give this a try its yummy and relaxing.

review/summary: Not to my taste
review/text: I have always found pure green tea a bit bland, so I ordered this to see how it tasted. I find it to be a nice blend with a citrus overtone, not bitter at all, but with a taste that is not to my personal liking.<br /><br />This is a blend of green tea, lemon grass, lemon balm herb, and verbena leaves. The overall effect on the taste is of a green tea (which is already not as strong as black tea) and a definite (but not overpowering)  overtone of the lemon. The verbena leaves are commonly promoted to help relaxation, but the box makes no such claim; it is just supposed to be a nice blend. The box suggests steeping for 3 minutes. I tried that, and also tried it steeped longer. It did not seem to get bitter even when the bag was left in until the cup was empty. I like the fact that the bags were individually wrapped, since I think this makes the tea stay fresh longer.<br /><br />Summary: If you like lemon tea and you like green tea, this may be the blend for you. I recommend it for the high quality brew it produces, but only if those two flavors are to your liking.

review/summary: smooth green tea
review/text: I drink a lot of green tea while working, and for convenience's sake it's often in pre-bagged form.  That doesn't always make for the smoothest or best cup of tea, so it's very nice to come across a good blend that's easy to brew with limited resources.  Higgins & Burke's Green Tea has been one of the best I've tried yet.  The lemon flavor is a nice touch, I haven't found it to be that overpowering, more like a nice accent to the blend.  There's been no 'bitterness' that can sometimes result with other green teas I've bought, just a smooth, enjoyable cup of tea which is great.

The subtle flavors of the lemon enhance its flavor and aroma giving this an oriental flair.<br /><br />Usually I will drink my tea without honey but this seems to need it to balance the lemon flavor, but it does taste nice wihtout it, I am just choosinig it today.<br />This is not my favorite tea since it comes in a bag and you only get one serving per bag, and that is fine.<br />I prefer cake teas that are fermented.<br /><br />However this tea will be the one I carry with me when I go out to dine, it is that good.

This green tea has a mild, smooth, slightly sweet flavor with no sharpness or bitter aftertaste. The label says it has lemon grass and lemon balm herb in it, and I could taste a hint of those flavors, just enough to be interesting.<br /><br />I don't usually care for iced tea, but I let some of this tea get cold just to see what would happen. To my surprise, I liked it cold, too. Still flavorful and smooth with no aftertaste. No need to add sugar.<br /><br />I'll definitely buy this again. I like it better than the brand of green tea I've been drinking.

review/summary: Lemony
review/text: This unusual green tea is imported--from Canada.  It includes sencha green tea, lemon grass, lemon balm herb, and verbena leaves.  This, of course, gives it a lemony taste.  It includes 165 mg of polyphenols per serving -- so it should be good for your health.  Strangely, the package suggests you steep for only 1-3 minutes.  Usually, one steeps for about 5.  However, I usually steep longer because I like strong tea.  This tea, even when steeped longer is still extremely mild IMHO.  Also, I drink tea straight up--no lemon (except for iced tea) and no milk.  If you use milk in your tea (British style), this one probably won't work too well for you.  But, if you like a mild tea with a lemony taste, you'll probably like this one a lot.  It depends on your personal taste, bud.

review/summary: An delicious and sustainable tea!
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker, usually hot, and all year long. Even in the hottest weather, I still like my hot tea, so I was very pleased to be able to have a chance to try out this Higgins and Burke green tea.<br /><br />I love this product. Not all green teas are the same. Some have a sharp bite at the end and leave the tongue feeling dry and tangy. Others are too dark and strong for me, and I have to remove the bag as soon as the hot water has poured over it to keep it from getting even stronger.<br /><br />But this Higgins & Burke Green Tea is excellent. Even after sitting for five minutes (recommended time is 1-3), it has a warm, mellow brown color to it. It has a light scent, and a very light and pleasing taste - no after bite. This tea has added lemon grass and lemon balm herb, but I can't taste the lemon at all. What I get from this combination is a light sweetness so that no added sugar, honey, or sweetener is needed.<br /><br />The other wonderful thing about this product is that each bag is individually wrapped in a moisture seal pouch. I know this means there is extra packaging to discard or recycle, but really it is excellent because once the box is opened, all the tea bags will stay fresh. Also, this extra packaging means that I can carry these in my purse or backpack.<br /><br />Finally, and one of the most important items for me is that Higgins & Burke is a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership which promotes social and environmental sustainability and fair trade. What a major plus!!!

review/summary: Nice taste, a good change of pace from my usual black tea!
review/text: I generally stick to black tea, but occasionally make a cup of green.  I found THIS tea to be pleasant tasting.  Mild with just a hint of lemon tartness.  Individually wrapped bags are sealed in foil type packets, much superior to the usual black tea paper packets.  Being lazy, I enjoy the convenience of tea bags.  I know some people say bagged tea doesn't taste the same as loose tea, but my personal taste can't tell the difference.<br /><br />Price would be a concern for me.  As an average middle-income person, I'd say that I'd consider this to be more of a "luxury" treat than an everyday tea as it's rather pricey for my liking, being roughly four times the cost of black tea.  If cost were no object, I'd be a steady customer!  It IS better tasting, and the packaging and quality are superior, but too hard for me to justify as more than an occasional "treat" on my salary.<br /><br />I'd rate this tea FIVE STARS for taste, but comparatively high cost knocks my overall rating down to FOUR STARS.  Great as a soothing luxury for those "bad days"!

review/summary: Excellent BALANCED Green Tea +++
review/text: I just had a big hot cup of this fine green tea. Higgins & Burke have an unsually balanced green tea via this special variant -- balanced very well via addition of some lemon grass, lemon balm herb and verbena leaves -- spot-on to balance-out any harsh bitterness that some green teas have. Yet it is very much a mellow "sweet" "premium" Sencha green tea -- and neither too strong nor too weak -- after a full three minutes brewing under boiling water poured  over two bags of this green into my large cup. So I like this green -- even tho I usually like black, amber or white teas for being less bitter -- and must balance usual green teas via adding my own lemon, orange or mint. When I do have this tea via my own blend with orange black tea and some mint [and iced] -- it is very good indeed -- BUT I am impressed that this green tea is so good hot with adding just some brown sugar +++

review/summary: Smooth...
review/text: Let me first express that I have a new-found love of green tea.  I've been drinking lots of matcha lately, but it's a pricey habit and I must admit that it took a few cups to get past that vegetable-y/seaweed-y/aquarium-y fragrance when lifting the cup to my mouth.<br /><br />With Higgins & Burke Green Tea you get none of that.  Sure, it's not matcha, but it is still green tea.  I'm thinking of it as an everyday, budget friendly green tea that doesn't skimp on fresh flavor.  It doesn't overstuff tea bags with lesser quality leaves, which is pretty clear by the smoothness of the brew and the lack of bitterness (even when overbrewed by me.. oops!).  The tea is a lovely pale yellowy-green and fairly clear in my mug.<br /><br />You will notice that the tea is not purely Sencha, but lemongrass, lemon balm, and verbena have been added as well.  I think the Higgins & Burke people are wise to include these herbs, in the ratios they included them, as they offer a lovely fragrance during drinking- not overwhelming in it's lemony contribution, but rather more along the lines of a "note" you might describe when tasting a fine wine.<br /><br />The lemony constituents compliment the green tea, rather than overtly flavoring it.<br />I might even imagine bagged green tea to be naked without those complimentary herbs.<br /><br />So I give this a 5/5 stars.  Be forewarned, this Higgins & Burke Green Tea may be a gateway tea- one that gets you to take the plunge to more adventurous green teas. Unless, of course, you try this last in your search for a good utilitarian-sort of drinking green tea sans ceremony.  Then you might be like me, comfortable and cozied up with a large mug-full, content that you have tried many and found "the one".

review/summary: Mellow with a Hint of Lemon
review/text: There are quite a few varieties of green tea on the market, to say the least. I have tried many. Lately, I have been drinking Twinings. Generally, I prefer pure green tea.<br /><br />Interestingly, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea. The difference is in the processing. Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste. Green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas. I find that  green tea is good for early evening. It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />This product has a less pronounced taste then the Twinings, but it is smooth with a pronounced hint of lemon. Altogether, I like the flavor.  The caffein level seems to be about the same as other green teas.  I could get used to this product.

review/summary: mild green tea with lovely hit of lemon....
review/text: By the time I get to the office each morning, I am not in need of more stimulation, so I switch from coffee to green tea.  I've tried a lot of them some good, some kind of plain and others that were exceptionally good.  Though I have not heard of this particular brand before or bought their teas I would be more apt to try others after trying their spin on green tea, which has a lovely lemon flavor from lemon grass and verbena.  I normally drink my morning tea with nothing in it and this tea was nice and mild with a hit of lemon.  It was lovely on it's own.  I tried another cup in the afternoon with a teaspoon of sugar.  I liked it that way as well, with the sugar really bringing out the nice flavor.  I would guess if you sweetened it with honey it would be amazingly good.<br /><br />Overall, a very good tea.  I would definitely consider purchasing this item or recommend to others looking for a good green tea.

review/summary: Lemongrass Green Tea
review/text: When I lived in Japan I developed a pretty serious green tea habit.  Green tea is ever-present in the Japanese office, and I came to love the daily ritual of a cup of tea after lunch.  And when I say green tea, I mean green tea.  As in, the only ingredient in the list should be green tea. I like the grassy taste of good green tea, and don't feel the need to disguise it with any other flavors.<br /><br />And that was what I was expecting with this "Higgins & Burke Green Tea."  But it wasn't what I recieved.<br /><br />Generally, if green tea is some sort of blend it will announce it in the name.  This tea has a distinct lemon flavor, and I knew right away I was getting some sort of blend.  I had to investigate the ingredients on the box to discover the additional lemon grass, lemon balm herb, and verbena leaves. The ad copy for this says "Escape to the Far East imperial blend of green tea," but I can tell you from personal experience that this blend of lemon and green tea comes from the West, not the Far East!<br /><br />It wasn't a bad flavor, and the blend makes for a decent tea.  But anyone ordering this and expecting that distinct green tea taste will be as surprised as I was.

review/text: I drink a lot of green and black teas and was mildly surprised at the flavor of this green tea.  The lemon flavor is very, very light and mild, basically a hint of lemon flavor.  It's very nice and it blends nicely with the green tea.  I found that if you steep the tea bag in almost to a boiling point cup of hot water, the lemon taste really comes out but not too much to where it is overpowering the green tea tast.<br /><br />Another nice thing about this tea is the natural sweetness to it.  I usually add a packet of sweetener to my cup of tea and the tea was a bit too sweet.  In the next cup of Higgins & Burke green tea I did not add sweetener and it was perfect!  Very nice and relaxing cup of tea when you want to wind down from the day.

The flavors were just strong enough, but not too strong. It didn't need any sweeteners added to create a pleasant drink. I did have trouble picking up on the lemon flavors. It is either very subtle or my palate is just not sensitive enough. I've had many green teas taste almost fishy and this was not the case with Higgins & Burke thankfully. This is a really good tea! I really enjoyed the unique flavor and will enjoy adding to my tea drinking repertoire in order to mix it up a bit.

review/summary: Very Nice Green Tea Experience!
review/text: I drink green tea for health benefits. It really isn't something that I drink just because it tastes good. Some green tea tastes like dishwater. I very much enjoyed the full, richer taste of the Higgins & Burke Green Tea. I don't like sweetened tea. This tea does have a natural sweetness that was just right for me. An added touch was the lemongrass and lemon balm. You can never get too much of those. Very nice! I'll be drinking a lot of this one.<br /><br />As an extra, when I drink green tea, my skin looks healthier. My hands tend to get really rough, but when I drink more than a couple of cups of green tea per day, the roughness goes away. Easier than remembering the hand lotion.

review/summary: Yummy food for cats with a problem
review/text: If you have a cat with urinary problems who must eat a special diet Royal Canin Feline Urinary SO Morsels in gravy is worth a try. We used the dry food for some time but found that we needed a wet food for morning feedings. My cat is so hungry in the morning that he would eat the dry quickly and then regurgitate it immediately. When we gave the wet food for morning feeding it solved that problem. My cat loves to lick the gravy out of the can as a bonus. He seems to eat the wet more slowly and is able to digest it well. And, of course, it is a formula made just for his Urinary problems so this is a win, win item. The fact that I can purchase this sometimes hard to find item through Amazon is so convenient. I do not have to run around from store to store trying to find someone who carries this speciialized product.

review/summary: Expensive but well worth it!
review/text: This stuff is really quite pricy, so it lost a star on my review.  However, it works wonders for our cat Olive who has had 3 life threatening struvite crystal blockages in his little life before going on this diet when he was 2 years old.  He is now 11 and going strong. It is SO GREAT to be able to purchase this online and without an RX! Thank you soooo much!!! We live in such a remote area that we have to drive an hour to the nearest Petsmart to buy Urinary SO brand food with a prescription. They only have a limited supply of it there, and don't carry this size can with the morsels in gravy--and what a hassle to get our vet to prescribe something he doesn't carry at his practice! (The other urinary RX brands did NOT work for Olive, so that is the reason we went with the SO). And, because he has to be on this food for life, it was wonderful to find another option besides dry kibble & solid wet food in large cans. The smaller 3oz cans with morsels in gravy style is Olive's dream come true!! He is pleased and so are we!! Definitely buying again!

review/summary: Cats loved it!
review/text: I bought this particular cat food because it was vet recommended for one of my cats that underwent surgery for urethra complications.  The three males loved this special food.  Sadly the complications were more than my ketty could handle and we had to put him to sleep.  I would definitely buy more of this very healthy cat food.

review/summary: Eureka!
review/text: We've always wondered why the Kettle Corn we got at fairs and festivals tasted so much better than what we tried to do at home. We finally learned that Mushroom popcorn makes for a much fluffier, fuller and superior bag of Kettle Corn! Determined to surprise my fiance for the holidays, I started a quest for Mushroom popcorn kernals and finally found JustPoppin. Eureka! I quickly ordered 2 lbs, along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058IBRK6">Stainless Steel Induction Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a> and we've been poppin' up a storm ever since! It took some practice (watch their videos) -- but we quickly mastered homemade Kettle Corn and now laugh every time we pass the grocery store brands. There's simply no comparison. JustPoppin's customer service and support is terrific, too. We've been ordering from them for over a year now and enjoy trying all their new varieties, flavorings and popping techniques!

I was much more comfortable that I was going to get a high quality and FRESH product. And I did.

review/text: This product was extremely disappointing!  No way did it look anything like the picture and it was full of hulls.  The last time I was at a Farmers Market and purchased kettle corn, I asked them what kind of popcorn they used to get such big kernels.  I was told mushroom popcorn, so I was so excited to find this product at Amazon.  I followed the directions for popping and the kernels were no different from the corn I buy at the supermarket at a fraction of the cost!

review/summary: I had to say something about it...
review/text: A friend of mine gave me a small bag of this quality corn for my birthday and it is AMAZING! He knew I am a avid fan of popcorn and am always searching for something new. He did mention the hulls and said "So long as you chew it and NOT try to inhale it, it would be good" and good it was. I only stove top so it was great to see the corn pop up so big, just a handful and it filled up a 24qt bowl (Cause you can't eat good popcorn in a small bowl). Lightly seasoned to taste with salted butter and seasoning salt, Perfect! So I only wrote cause of the knuckleheads that bad mouthed something that I thoroughly enjoyed. Buy a small sample and see for yourself and don't let others keep you from the good stuff...

review/summary: Just as described as long as you follow the instructions.
review/text: I bought a 3lb bag and had it sent to my parents.  They raved that it came out great so I bought a 5lb bag myself.  I have tried it once so far.  I popped 1/4 cup with 1 1/2 tbs of butter flavored canola oil in the 6 qt Lindy's popper.  I followed the instructions that states that you should only toss in a few kernels at the beginning while the oil heats up.  When those three pop, dump in the rest since the oil will be at optimum temperature.  I did so and started to crank away.  All the kernels popped in about 10 seconds since it was a small batch.  Came out fine, but a little chewier than expected because since the kernels were fuller than regular butterfly popcorn.  It did get a little crispier when more steam was allowed to escape.  Flavor was fine with a light bit of popcorn salt.

review/summary: not for eating 'as-is'
review/text: As claimed in ads this corn is for added flavoring such as caramel. If purchased for popping and eating 'as-is' you'll discover wonderfully huge corn puffs with NO TASTE. The ads are correct, buy to flavor or not I'm not intentionally criticizing this corn, the mistake I made was assuming it would taste as great as it looks, without caramel.

review/summary: THE necessary ingredient for home made kettle corn
review/text: Some things are just harder to make at home.  My mom, who was a marvelous cook, never could get home-made pickles right.  If you want to make kettle corn (you know, like the stuff you buy at the county fair) you really, really need this as an ingredient.  I'm still not 100% of the way to making awesome kettle corn at home (it's merely very good) but I'd be nowhere without this mushroom popcorn.

review/summary: Where have you been all my life!
review/text: Can't believe I'm only the second person to review these! I've actually been served these at a restaurant in hollywood and a cafe in beverly hills...i finally remembered to track them down and order them. They are every bit as good as I remember them. I've actually found a grocery store I buy them from now and have tried about half the blends they offer. These definitely have that wow factor the first time you see them, everyone i've shown them to goes nuts. Make sure you do NOT try to tear the stick open, there are holes in the stick that the water goes through to brew the leaves. It's extremely convenient and kind of addicting stirring the stick around and brewing the tea that way. I take it straight so no sugar or anything else. I've liked all the one's i've tried and a few were super delicious. (peach green tea, chamomile and passion black tea are my favorite ones so far) I could see how a hard core tea drinker who would want that really bold astringent taste might be a littler underwhelmed.  At least the blends I've tried don't fit that category, but they have a really nice taste and are the smoothest teas I've ever drank. Definitely recommend them and suggest you give them a try if you're a tea drinker, I'm seriously hooked :)

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I found the beans to be of poor quality.  They were packaged in a plastic zipper-sealed bag, not vacuum sealed as I would have expected.  The pods were completely dried out, stiff and flat, not oily and supple as one expects of gourmet quality beans; I was afraid the beans would snap if bent.  There was no oily residue common in good quality vanilla beans.  Getting the caviar out of the pod is going to be tricky in this condition.  The color on the pods is less consistent than I would prefer.  The fragrance, while markedly vanilla, was diluted, likely due to the pods' overly dry condition.  I would suggest that the poor condition of the beans is likely due to the method they were packaged.  Vacuum sealing the beans would have protected them from drying out much better than a plastic bag with a simple zipper seal, which is far from air tight.  The beans are more of extract quality than of gourmet quality.  I am completely unimpressed.
