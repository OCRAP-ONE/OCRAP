review/text: I have tried a number of different DeCaf K-Cups.  Most are pretty weak and rather insipid.  The Tully's Extra Bold French Roast is an exception with pretty good flavor.  Would I like it a little more bold - yes, but they are probably limited in how much coffee they can put in the container simply by the small container size.<br />Neil Bell

review/text: This was the first time I ordered "coffee" to be shipped.  I love the taste of French Roast decaf - tastes like a real cup of coffee and wasn't able to find "decaf" locally.  The vendor I used to ship it was costly and it took a long time to receive.  I've since found another supplier ..... I still love the coffee, plus I enjoy free shipping and it arrives in just days!  The best of all worlds.  I recommend this blend to real coffee lovers - it's hearty and even has the fresh brewed coffee smell - which I missed using the Keurig cups.  This has it all.

review/summary: The best decaf
review/text: Almost a year ago now I suffered from 4-5 debilitating cluster migraines a week that were killing me.  Then I read some article online that lead me to believe the migraines might have been triggered by caffein.  So I completely stopped drinking caffein about a year ago.  It was very hard to stop drinking caffeinated coffee (and soda) but it was worth it because it successfully reduced my migraines from several a week to about ten in a year (and two of those migraines were caused by drinking unlabeled Amish root beer which must have caffeine in it).  But, I still missed the comfort and taste of morning coffee and holding a warm mug in my hand while sitting on the porch wrapped in a blanket and the smell or going to coffee shops.  After no coffee for several months, I tired decaf for the first time and experienced no headaches, but the taste was so bland that it wasn't worth the calories.  I experimented with many different decaf brands, including Starbucks.  This past weekend, I visited my cousin who insisted I try this brand.  And, hellooooo!  This is what I remember coffee tasting like!!!  It's smooth, bold, strong without making you spit it out, it has flavor!  It doesn't leave a gross taste in your mouth!  I didn't believer her that it was decaf, but I did not get a migraine!  So here I am on Amazon to buy myself some of this, although I'd prefer to purchase a bag of these beans rather than the K-cups, which I find wasteful.  Unfortunately the bags of the coffee are currently unavailable.  I highly recommend this brand and blend of coffee.

review/text: I choose French roast coffee, as in my opinion, lighter roasts become weaker flavored if one selects the larger cup size. This coffee tastes rich and smoky whether served hot or cold, and for connoisseurs of satisfying, truly flavorful coffee, this will not dissapoint. The extra bold flavor stands up well to the addition of cream, so chilled coffee beverages are delightfully flavorful.

review/text: Strong coffee is enjoyable to me, but Tully's Decaf French Roast has an acrid, burnt taste that I don't enjoy.  I can choke it down by adding lots of creamer. Timothy's Rainforest Expresso Decaf makes a strong cup with a smoother taste.  I understand that the French Roasts have a stronger taste. I've used Starbucks French Roast in the past in my drip coffee maker and was pleased with it.  This variety is almost undrinkable!

review/text: I decided to try Tully's brand French Roast and Medium Roast decaf coffies in Kcups from my local Staples.<br /><br />If you like bold, dark, smokey, tangy coffee like me, you will like Tully's darker roasted coffee's.<br /><br />A friend also gave me a 48 box from Amazon.com. And it is just as fresh and tasty. (all well before their printed expiry dates)<br /><br />Both were at a cost of roughly 60-70 cents a cup. Pretty reasonable. I was able to find it at the same price in a local store, but if you cannot the Amazon price is very fair!<br /><br />I usually enjoy Starbucks or Newmans-Own brand dark/bold roasts. But I will now add Tully's brand to that list.

review/summary: one month of use made a nonbeliever out of me
review/text: In reading all the reviews of different decaf k-cups, the opinion I came away with was that Tully's was where I should go to get a really bold, dark roasted flavor similar to Starbucks' coffee. It does get closer to Starbucks than any of the other decaf k-cups I have tried. But in a way it goes too far and results in a somewhat strange and overpowering taste.<br /><br />I had tried Timothy's decaf and Newman's Own decaf, with the latter vastly superior to the former. I would say Tully's beats Timothy's (which is just brown water), but probably not Newman's. I also tried Donut Shop decaf simultaneously with Tully's (I had Donut Shop at work and Tully's at home). For the first few days, I thought Donut Shop was a little weak and I liked Tully's better for its bolder flavor. But after a couple of weeks I grew tired and a little sick of Tully's strong taste - it's not just strong like a normal cup of Starbucks, it's strong almost like they added some kind of artificial chemical to it to make it taste darker or more burned than it really is. After one month I was long done with the Donut Shop and was just slowly getting through the Tully's (diluted with lots of milk).<br /><br />When I reordered, I only considered Newman's or Donut Shop. I couldn't bring myself to drink another cup of Tully's. It's a shame because they definitely took a step in the right direction with their stronger flavor, but it was a misstep that makes the coffee a poor choice for long-term consumption.<br /><br />Perhaps a good strategy for a newcomer would be to order Tully's AND another brand or two like Newman's and Donut Shop, and trade off which one they drink. That might make Tully's flavor less grating over time

review/summary: Delicious, nutritious product!
review/text: I have a very picky eater, so it's hard to find things that are good for him AND that he'll eat. He loves these!  All three of my boys eat these.  The only thing that I don't like about this product is that it only comes in 4 oz individual serving cups. It's convenient, but I hate the extra waste. But, that aside, it's a wonderful product!<br /><br />Here's what's inside!<br /><br />There are three different flavors: Apple blend, Strawberry blend, and Mixed berry blend.<br /><br />And the ingredients:<br /><br />Apple blend: apples, apple concentrate, water, dextrin (soluble fiber source), ascorbic acid (vitamin C.)<br /><br />Strawberry blend: apples, apple concentrate, water, strawberry puree, dextrin (soluble fiber source), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), vegetable juice (for color), natural flavoring.<br /><br />Mixed berry blend: apples, apple concentrate, water, strawberry puree, raspberry puree, dextrin (soluble fiber source), blueberry puree, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), vegetable juice (for color), natural flavoring.<br /><br />Per cup there are 90 calories, 10 mg of sodium, 24 g of carbohydrates, 3 g of fiber, and 100% DV of vitamin c.  The amount of sugar in the apple blend and strawberry blend is 19 grams. The mixed berry has 18 grams of sugar per cup.

I use 1/4 cup sugar instead of the tablespoon indicated on the package.<br />Pour the glaze quickly after cooking, with a small stream aimed at each piece of fruit to cover all of them completely.<br />Don't plan to keep these long. The fruit colors bleed into the glaze over a couple of days, so they look much better soon after completion. Refrigeration is nice, but unnecessary.<br />Good stuff!

review/summary: I love these flakes
review/text: This is the first time I have bought or tried any of the Natures Path cereals.  I live in a rural area, and am disabled, so I have to depend on my husband to do the grocery shopping.  I don't know if they sell these where he shops, but, I am very greatful to Amazon for carrying a pretty good selection of food products in large amounts.  Anything that is going to last for a while, like this cereal, I put in the freezer so there is no problem with it going bad.  This cereal is pretty crunchy, but, a little thick.  Other than that they have a very good taste to me  I also like the fact that there is nothing artificial.  Also, if you add some of Bob's Red Mill Meusli to the flakes, it really kicks it up a notch, with more grains and texture.  I plan to try every one of the Natures Path cereals, but it might take a while!

review/summary: Hearty flakes
review/text: First off the deal Amazon is giving on this excellent line of cereal is outstanding; you simply cannot beat the subscription price with an average of 7 a bag in stores. Considering that organic oats are not cheap this cereal really gives you your $ worth.<br /><br />That said this bag of Oat flakes is surely one of the best of the line, it's extremely nutritious. It's also just flakes which allows you to add whatever you want to it such as raisins or bananas etc. Personally my strongest like in a breakfast food is oats and when you can have it in flakes it's value is double. I highly recommend this cereal as a starter in the truly awesome Nature's Path Eco-Pac line. All of their cereals are good but this one truly makes a full breakfast meal. The protein content is extremely high for the amount of fiber and nutrients in it.

review/summary: not such a good deal!
review/text: This is a great product, and of the many granolas, cereals, flakes that I've checked,  it has the lowest amount of sugar per ounce. Most health store granolas, cereals, flakes, contain as much sugar as their equivalent at a supermarket. However, these Amazon prices are higher(or equal) than the list prices at health food stores in my area, Santa Monica, California.  At $9.50 per 32 oz bag, there's no reason to buy them here unless you are in a remote area.  And that's not including shipping.  Also, several times a year I see them on sale(at local health food stores) for $5-$6.50 per 32 oz bag.  That's what I'd like to see on Amazon all the time.

And of course they are almost always in stock @ Amazon.com. I always subscribe save the extra money. Mine have always traveled well, sometimes they come in there own box sometimes they are a box in a box. I do wish they put less sugar in them as they are rather sweet. I also switch between these and the Heritage Multigrain flakes.

review/text: I thought I had ordered normal stride spearmint gum from the pictures and the reviews. STride 2.0 is known for being terrible among chewers who had the original. It lasts less than a hour and has a nasty after taste. It is like chewing on soft rubber and the flavor dissipates incredibly fast. You get a burst of flavor and then a minute later it's gone. Waste of money. They should really change the picture and/or the information.

review/text: I'm a frequent gum chewer, especially while at work after coffee or lunch to keep the breath fresh. I've always been particular to this flavor and brand. Generally, I buy 1 pack at a time at about $1 per pack. The only reason I bought  this item was because I needed another order that was relatively cheap to complete the free shipping on another product I purchased. However, I must say, this might not be my last time doing it. While the savings aren't huge, it's enough to justify buying in bulk rather than 1 pack a time at the store, and you can never have enough gum!

review/text: I am a regular user of this Stride Spearmint gum. Although, since February of 2011, they've upgraded to something called Stride v2.0, with new packaging. And, they don't make this regular Stride. While, the item doesn't show the v2.0, I just assumed I would be getting that one, since they don't make the old one. But, they sent me the old expired stock of regular stride which was probably manufactured more than 6 months to a year ago. I guess I am going back to buying it from supermarkets, instead of here!!!

We drank much of it before it ever got to the bottling stage but I did manage to bottle and age 9 bottles for a  little over a month.  It is much better if you can get it bottled for a while.  Even though it says it is a 4 week kit, I'd suggest not rushing it. Good wine is never rushed.  Stretch the fermenting to 4 to 6 weeks before adding stabilizers and clarifiers.  Then leave another few weeks and bottle.  Free shipping is a plus.

For the money this can't be beat, however I have noticed a significant difference in, appearance & taste. I have tried using a 19 liter vs. the 23 liter with great sucess.

review/summary: Great value
review/text: Made several of these Vino Italiano kits and have been impressed. They are great to make and drink while you have better kits aging. If you add raisins to the red kits it helps add some body. They don't compare to $10 bottles of wine, but are still a good value. I will order more of them to have as everyday drinkers.

review/summary: Good kit but follow these recommendations
review/text: I make wine on the side, and at first it took a lot of research and time.<br /><br />If your new at wine making, get this kit but be warned you will need more than just this kit. Besides the kit, you will need a glass carboy, plastic fermentor (plastic bucket), glass bottles 25-30, corker (to insert corks) and gas release knob (to vent gas, without getting the fermentor dirty). Everything else is optional, such as pump (recommended), funnels, thermometer, filters, heat gun (for shrinking covers), etc.<br /><br />Also, for a better taste create 5 gallons of the kit instead of 6 (simply stop adding water at the 5 gallon mark). A common word used in the instructions is "MUST." Its simply the mixture of water, grapes, and yeast.<br /><br />In sum, it will cost roughly $80-120 for all the equipment (that can be reused over and over) and $40 for this kit. Doing the math, it will cost $1.50 to $3.00 a bottle, not bad for table wine.

review/summary: Foolproof Kit
review/text: This kit makes it easy to make a good wine. I have found the Vino Italiano kits to be slightly watered down,so instead of making 6 gallons per kit,I make 5 gallons,then it is really good. It still comes to less than $2 per bottle,and the alcohol is 12.5% instead of 11%.

review/summary: Outstanding Kit, and not Just for the Money, but Patience is the Rule
review/text: I just bottled this kit the night before last, and even the sample I took from the bottling wand was excellent. Rich, complex, dark and a bit fruity, as a good Merlot should be. My one caution: you can make a decent wine with this kit in 4 weeks, but if you're willing to wait 12, you'll be amazed at what the same kit will give you.<br /><br />The Winemakermag article "Making Your Kit Wine Shine, Redeaux" (exercise your Google-fu) has good instructions for taking the appropriate amount of time with a kit like this one, and after following the article's advice, of all the red kit wines I've made this one is by far the best.<br /><br />I didn't reduce the dilution, I didn't add sugar. I just stretched out the aging period and degassed the wine thoroughly when it was time (heat the wine to 75 degrees F or more--CO2 doesn't come out of the wine easily at lower temps), and the kit's ingredients really shone through. My wife and I will be enjoying this batch for some time to come!<br /><br />Happy fermenting!

review/summary: Amazon Wine Kit,  Good results Low Price
review/text: We have been wine makers for about 6 years buying kits from local retailers of which a few we had to travel a good distance.  I was pleasantly suprised by the quality of these wine kits.  We also signed up for automatic delivery so we are cutting our cost of producing a liter of wine down to about $1.75/liter.  Good uh.  Wine bottle labels, corks and shrink caps are all included so these is nothing extra to buy.

review/text: This wine kit is easy to make, reliable, and high quality. Grape must is reliable; fermentation starts in half an hour, completes in 8 days. Makes 6 gallons; it's easy to rack into a 6 gal. barrel for oak aging (6 gal is smallest barrel available). Color is strong and dark, tannins are good, round and right amount, and acidity is preadjusted. The Result is easy good quality wine.

review/text: i purchased a 4 week  chianti wine kit [ vino italiano ]  the wine is like it is watered down. they dont give you enough juice. also it is suppose to be around 11%  mine came out at 8%  i ended up throwing it out.  also purchased a shiraz and a pinot chardany and the shiraz spoiled when i added the chitosan. the pinot chardany is also a very weak wine.

review/text: I am so glad Amazon had our brand! After our distributor went out of business, I couldn't find Hi-Tek anywhere! We switched our two Cattle dog mixes to Hi-Tek from Blue Buffalo after it made our 9-year-old gassy. This food is all natural and made in America (even the packaging is made in the USA) and I can get a huge bag of Hi-Tek for $20 less than other natural brands in the pet store with Amazon's free shipping. When I forgot to order more food and had to get another natural brand at the pet store, my dog turned her nose up at it and waited until we got the Hi-Tek in the mail (the next day) to eat!<br /><br />I don't know what I would've done without Hi-Tek! Natural food on a budget.

review/summary: Drastic cost increases!
review/text: My 4 stars is for the original price!!! I bought a 35# bag of Hi-Tek Naturals Lamb Meal for Less Active and Large Breeds in 10/6/12 for $36.80. Only a week later it is OVER DOUBLE this price ($76.34 on 10/11/12)?? It is a good dog food, but for $36! It is not worth over 75 dollars! I hope they get such a decrease in revenue that they revert to their original price.<br /><br />As for this food itself, I do like Hi-Tek brand and have tried multiple foods. My dog likes all of them fine, and her stools are smaller, less frequent, less smelly. The fat content of this Less active formulation is 12% as opposed to the normal 16% ( Hi-tek chicken meal with sweet potato is my comparison, $47.38 for 30# on 10/6/12, $45.99 for 30# 7/7/2012). However, the protein is decreased from the normal food - this one is 21% and normal food is 32%. I believe this is a reflection in the decrease of the quality of ingredients. The first five ingredients in the Less active formulation are: Lamb meal, pearled barley, white rice, brown rice, whole milo (another grain) followed by pork meal and some vitamins. Seems to me, a smart person would just buy the regular food and add some rice! The first five ingredients of the regular formulation are: Chicken meal, sweet potato, peas, pork meal, egg followed by duck meal, salmon meal, and a bunch of fruits and vitamins.<br /><br />Bottom line: love Hi-tek, kinda upset about the price changes, this food is not worth a penny over the original formulation even though you get 5# more. In this food they just cut protein sources and fruits and added more "filler" like rice.
