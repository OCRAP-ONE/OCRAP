review/summary: Ir'a like a Thanksgiving SweetPotato&Carrot&Apples Meal for your Toddler!
review/text: Now that my daughter is 2, I really appreciate that the HappyTot pouches really seem to keep the toddler's needs in mind, by offering a good size portion pouch for them, great flavors and especially this one, is my daughter's favorite in the veggie options.  I tasted it too since the combo of Sweet Potato, Apple, Carrots really seemed like a "Thanksgiving" meal to me and wow, it was! It's like eating a pureed version of the Thanksgiving Meal side dish!  I loved this side dish with my Turkey so it's so funny that my daughter does too.  Chock full of Vitamin A, being organic and all veggies and fruits, it's a great snack for her and meal supplement to her other foods.  The portability is perfect and that extra dash of cinnamon, makes me have a great respect for the company which shows how they really want the product to be tasty while maintaining the healthy offerings too!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VBPN2">HAPPYBABY Happy Tot - Stage 4: Sweet Potato, Apple, Carrots and Cinnamon, 4.22  Ounce Pouch (Pack of 16)</a>

review/text: I just love this tea! I only drink decaf after 6pm or so or I cannot sleep. I'm always on the lookout for a great unique tea - and this one fits to a T!<br /><br />I thought the vanilla flavor was not overly strong but you can clearly taste it. No bitter or strange after taste and it is suitably strong but not overly so.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: truest vanilla flavor!
review/text: I ordered the decaffeninated French Vanilla, because the regular wasn't in stock at the time.  I'd been meaning to cut back on caffeine anyway.  What I found is that the decaf type actually had a more pleasing and more intense vanilla flavor to it which I really enjoyed even more.  I plan to stay with the decaf variety from now on.

review/summary: Not Bigelow's best
review/text: I'm definitely in the minority with this opinion, but the vanilla flavor was not only too strong but it tasted artificial. (The ingredients list says "natural and artificial flavors" without specifically mentioning vanilla.)  This is not for someone who is looking for a tea accented with vanilla.  I am using 1 vanilla tea bag and 1 green tea bag which makes a more mellow brew, but I won't buy this again -- the Spiced Chai Decaf is so much better.

Like someone lightly and I mean lightly sprinkled bits of cinnamon and dried apples over cardboard. There are no vitamins added either. So there's little health value. They could've at least put some vitamins in there to make eating flavored cardboard worth it. I'll probably just eat this box as a snack alternative to potato chips. I can't afford to just toss them. Will NOT be buying them again.

review/summary: Non-cardboard gluten-free cereal
review/text: I almost didn't buy this from my local high-end grocery store because the price was so outrageous, but I'm glad I decided to go for it.  This is one of the better gluten-free cereals I've had.  It is not just like Cheerios, of course, but it has a pleasant taste of its own with just the right amount of sweetness added to make it flavorful.  It doesn't get soggy immediately like some gluten-free cereals, nor does it have that familiar "cardboard" texture those of us with celiac know all too well.  This product seems to have avoided the usual gluten-free problems, and I give the makers credit for that.<br /><br />I think it could have a little more cinnamon taste to it -- of course, I can always just add some myself -- and the price is still high compared to similar gluten-free cereals, regardless of where you buy it, but I think it's definitely worth trying if you're on a gluten-free diet and need something palatable.  I'll buy this again.

For being "all natural" it sure does pack an unpleasant wallop! Watch out! Maybe the Honey Nut is better...

review/text: Our 2 year old son is affected by Celiac disease and since his diagnosis we have had a difficult time finding snacks that are easy to take out on a play date or to a park.  The "Glutino Apple Cinnamon Rings" serve that purpose very well for us and he LOVES them.  They don't taste like your typical cereal that contains flour - of course they don't.  But for someone who is on a gluten free diet and is accustomed to way the way that processed gluten free food tastes, these are a great, quick snack.

review/text: I liked just about all the Capri Suns up until a few years ago. For some odd reason (possibly because tons of people in the U.S. have a mild to severe problem with being overweight) they decided it was a good idea to subtract most of the sugar in these drinks and leave us with a near flavorless, almost diet-like drink to suit the kids better. Was this a good idea? Maybe health-wise yes, but not if you actually want to enjoy one of these. What the hell happened? These drinks used to be good! Now all I can say is that I will only reach into the fridge for one of these when there is nothing but water and cranberry juice available! They taste nearly as bad as the new and "improved" "flavor-sucked-dry" Huggie drinks. Yuck! Absolutely dreadful.<br /><br />2 (deserved) stars.

Save the money and buy yourself a popcorn bag at your local grocery store and buy caramel in a jar and just pour on top of it plus it will cost you about 1/4 of this product.

review/summary: Coffe shop quality capuccino at home
review/text: I love coffee. Usually I would not recommend Maxwell House as I consider it a "supermarket brand". I was very surprised with the quality of this cappuccino. My wife loves it too!<br /><br />Contrary to instructions, we brew milk first then the espresso, this makes it look very nice, especially on a transparent cup. The taste is smooth and velvety, with low acidity and aftertaste. You can buy extra espresso T-Discs separately and brew an extra shot if you really like your coffee bold (like I do).<br /><br />In about a minute, you have a cappuccino that is as good as that of many coffee shops. Yes, it is not nearly close to making my personal list of best coffees I have tested, but you can't beat the convenience and cost. We also use it a lot to entertain guests at our house. Works great with any dessert.<br /><br />Instead of buying them one box for 6 coffees at a time, this 5-pack from Amazon really saves us money. Each set comes with 16 T-Discs: 8 espresso and 8 milk. So this 5-pack will be good for 40 cappuccinos.

review/text: This cappuccino is very good and tastes almost as good as Starbucks Latte Primo, T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers, 8 Count Packages (Pack of 2). The cream foams up well in the Tassimo machine. The only difference in taste between this Cappuccino drink and the Starbucks Latte Primo is that the coffee flavor is slightly stronger in the Starbucks product. Also, with the Cappuccino you brew the coffee first and then use the milk disc. With the Starbucks Latte Primo you brew the milk first then the coffee.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a bargain buy. As long as you are not looking for a slightly stronger coffee flavor, I'd suggest purchasing this instead of the Starbucks brand as both products use expresso coffee and milk discs.

review/summary: Fantastic Belgian chocolates!
review/text: My mom first tried Leonidas chocolates when a co-worker brought her a sample from Belgium years ago. Later, during a family trip to Amsterdam in 2001, we stopped at one of their shops and bought several pounds of this fantastic chocolate for ourselves and family members.  10 years later, I ordered these as a Christmas present to my mom, knowing how much she loves these chocolates, and Leonidas, still does not disappoint. These were a total hit for the holidays and my mother, who does not eat dark chocolate, even gobbled up all of the dark chocolate pralines included in the holiday ballotin, they're that good! They are totally worth the expense.

review/summary: A Truly Dreadful Product
review/text: This item is really Season's brand of hearts of palm, not Asian Harvest.  Nevertheless, they are awful.  Extremely woody and very hard to chew on the outside layer, tender in the middle, with a terrible bitter aftertaste.  There are distributed by Manischewitz, a generally reliable vendor of food products.  This, however, is a travesty!  The comparison between these and the brand carried occasionally by Costco, SunPix, is like night and day.  SunPix are tender, smooth, and taste great.  These are the exact opposite.

It doesn't effect the taste, but for around three bucks apiece, I mean?  Are the ones that aren't shattered sold separately?

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: I was first introduced to astronaut ice cream about 2-3 years ago and it is amazing and really fun to eat. I have a 4 & 8 year old boys and a 15 year old nephew that love these. They definitely are quite different from a real scoop of ice cream out of the freezer, but it is only in texture and the experience. I have since ordered these to give out at Christmas time for my son's classmates. I thought this would be a totally unique, great, and affordable gift for all of them and am sure most of them have not had this before. I definitely think everyone should try this at least once and if you don't want to buy the 15 packages you can order them individually and there's different flavors too. (There are 25 kids in the class so I ordered 2 of the bulk and then I'll have some left over for my nephew, boys, myself & husband).

review/summary: Great for "catkins" diet
review/text: We started buying 100% meat diets on our vet's recommendation for getting our big fatty to lose weight on a "catkins" diet.  Cats are obligate carnivores, so feeding them other foods that contain rice, or lots of vegetables, really isn't in line with how their bodies have evolved.  The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better.  They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey.  We mix in some Wysong "Call of the Wild" into the meat.<br /><br />Surprisingly, they love quail.  Far more than chicken, and a bit more than turkey.  My understanding is that cats naturally eat small fowl and rodents, so quail is actually the closest to what they actually eat in the wild.

Two weeks ago I switched them over to BG and I'm amazed in the change already.  The cat with chronic constipation has not had any problems, the one with chronic "itchy" skin has already shown improvement in her coat and is not frantically chewing and scratching.  My fat baby...that will take more than 2 weeks to determine any real improvement.<br />Over all THEY are happier, healthier and more active.  Oh, the Quail is a BIG hit!

review/text: I was hoping for the sourness of a hard Warheads candy with a sort of gummy center, but this was not it. The outside was only mildly sour, and it's gone within about 10-15 seconds, then you're left with the chewy (not so much gummy) center. I was hoping it would be chewy like a gummy worm, but it was actually just sticky and soft. Not very appealing. It stuck to my teeth constantly! I found myself sucking the little bit of sourness off, then spitting out the chewy part. Not that great for me, hopefully others will enjoy it!

I've heard some reviews that say this food leads to gassiness and diarrhea... I imagine that could be true if someone was switching their dog from a very low quality dry or canned food because this is a wholesome, stew-like food.  It takes some adjustment to get used to but once your dog has adjusted, I don't think you'll find a better quality canned dog food.

review/summary: The new altered flavor of altoids wintergreen mints=YECH!
review/text: Altoids wintergreen mints were once my favorite flavor of altoids. They had a clean, refreshing, decidedly strong rush of pure mint flavor. For years I enjoyed the intense, clean sweet flavor, as I bit into them. Unfortunately, Wrigleys (the new owners) have altered the flavor (more artificial ingredients?) and added blue artificial color to them. The mints now taste like cheap toothpaste, that leaves an unpleasant chemical aftertaste in your mouth. These once delightful mints are now ghastly! Let's hope the Wrigley's people with the uneducated palates don't mess with the Peppermint Altoids!  I will not buy these wintergreen mints again, unless they change back to the old style, which was full of natural mint flavor, and artifical color free.  If you are lucky enough to find a tin that does not list "color (blue 1)" in the ingredients list, you've found some of the old style wintergreen mints (the good ones).  The full ingredients list on the original good wintergreen altoids was (sugar, natural and artificial flavors, gum arabic, gelatin).  Since I wrote this review I've been fortunate to find about a dozen boxes of the good, old mints.  These were at small out of the way grocery/drug stores that tend to charge a little more for their products.<br /><br />July, 2012: Well, it's been a year since I've been able to find a box of the good, old mints.  I broke down and bought a box of the new version today.  Wrigley's has added some of the natural flavor back to these mints, and they do taste slightly better.  However, they have left in the artificial color "blue 1", which negatively affects the flavor, and leaves  a bit of bitter aftertaste.  I won't buy them again.  I did buy 6 boxes of the Peppermint Altoids.  Thankfully, they are still the original formula, and as good as ever!

review/text: To Other Prospective Purchasers of Altoids Wintergreen Mints,<br />  I have enjoyed these mints for many, many years. however, the latest batch I bought, after Wrigley's purchased the company, are truly horrible. You get a short burst of minty flavor and then at least an hour's worth of a synthetic/chemical aftertaste which is quite unpleasant. I'll not buy them again unless Wrigley's returns to the original recipe. I guess they are saving a few cents by changing the recipe, but they are going to lose a whole lot of customers in my opinion.<br />  I would have rated the old Wintergreen Altoids with all the stars in the firmament, but the new ones rate none at all. Don't buy them unless you have to.

review/text: I loved wintergreen Altoids!  In fact I loved them so much I stocked up last year at Easter when they were on sale for half price.  I had enough to last until this week.  So I bought a couple of tins at my local grocery.  Today I opened one and found out 1) they are now blueish in color and 2) the taste is terrible!  What prompted Wrigley or whomever to change these?  I can't describe the taste except that it is too strong and has a bitter aftertaste - nothing like the Altoids I used to love (and I had a few left today so I could compare side-by-side).  If you love Wintergreen Altoids and haven't had the blue ones yet, don't buy them.  You will be very very disappointed.  I'm going to return the unopened tin and see if the grocery will take the opened one back too.

review/text: I fully agree with the last few reviews. Altoids were ruined when they started adding food coloring. Wintergreen Altoids are horrible now. These were the ONLY mints I would buy, but I won't be buying them any more.<br /><br />FAKE SUGAR, FAKE FLAVOR, FAKE COLOR = NO DEAL

review/text: I will not buy this product again. I cannot find the actual ingredients, Natural and other flavors are not sufficient for people with allergies. So far the peppermint is OK if I do not buy the minis. I may just stop buying Wrigley products in general when finding ingredient lists is this difficult.

review/summary: What happened? Blech!
review/text: The other review is correct... artificial color has been added to a great product and ruined it. The genius behind this decision should be tarred and feathered and run out of town on rail... ok, then, just fire them. The Altoid customer base, I would imagine, prefer natural ingredients and don't want crap... this is crap. The marketing genius behind this decision canNOT be a regular user of Altoids... any regular user would have known better... don't destroy a winner to make it look "pretty". I'm eating them for pete's sake, not dating them.<br /><br />Same with the Spearmint. Ruined by artificial color and ingredients.<br /><br />Duh... I guess I am too stupid to know the difference... Duh.<br /><br />I am still buying the Peppermint... for now. As far as I know, it is the only Altoid mint that still uses natural peppermint oil and no artificial colors... for now.<br /><br />OOoh oooh... how about this, marketing geniuses at Altoid... artificially colored red stripes in the Peppermint. Brilliant! Seriously, anybody that sees this and think it's a good idea needs to be FIRED.

review/text: I have been a fan of Wintergreen Altoids for years.  When my last 12-pack ran out, I picked up a 2-pack of tins at a local store.  These taste nothing like they used to, and in fact taste nothing like wintergreen at all.  This flavour is like a combination of peppermint and ozone.  I will not be buying any more until they follow Coca-Cola's example and bring back a "Classic" formulation.  Neither will I be consuming the remainder of this most recent package.

review/summary: We Love Altoids!!!
review/text: We love these Wintergreen Altoids! While they are a very good breath mint, we use them mainly for flavoring our coffee and sometimes, tea. One, in the bottom of the cup, or a few in the coffee/tea pot makes life more interesting! Also, good with just a touch of hot cocoa, added along with Altoids, in coffee. And yes, they are good in hot cocoa, too. Very inexpensive, easy way to flavor coffee or tea, much cheaper than alternative. Almost no calories, but big on flavor! We've used these for decades!

Then I found it in some circular candy with a hole in the middle. Now I keep a tin of ALTOIDS at work, home and in the car.

review/summary: Minty! But not too much.
review/text: For me, I'm a mint lover, I pop these like candy, and I don't think I'm the only one ;).<br /><br />These are really minty, but not as minty as the peppermint one, which I find too strong, to the point that it creates discomfort. So I love these, because its pretty powerful stuff, but not overwhelming. One thing I love about Altoids mints, is that when you first put one in your mouth, you get this pleasant sweet taste, and it slowly moves on to being minty, all without a sugar crust.<br /><br />The mints themselves are mainly shaped very nicely, but every now and then their deformed a little or cracked. (Which somehow adds to the traditional-ness.)<br /><br />The tin was great, kept the mints in there securely. I've never gotten a bad tin and there would be no reason to.<br /><br />I suggest these to anyone who likes mints, or has bad breath of any sort. These are just great.

review/summary: What the heck?
review/text: What the heck is going on with Lipton Darjeeling?  It disappeared from every one of the Indian shops in the S.F. Bay area about 6 months ago.  The tin you see above sold for about $11.  This tea was one of the best kept secrets I know.  Now the only tea approaching ... and I mean it is not as good ... it is Peet's Darjeeling, at $10 for 1/4 lb. tin.  The only other alternative for Darjeeling is to go to some of the Persian groceries and find it there.  They sell a brand that apparently has lower-quality Darjeeling that appears to be imported from India into Iran, then sent to U.S.  You could probably find other ethnic stores that have the same kind of thing.  Does anyone have an explanation for what is going on?

review/summary: Missing Darjeeling tea!
review/text: Our Minneapolis Indian shops stopped selling Darjeeling tea over a year ago. I love this tea as it tastes like the stuff I grew up drinking in England, altho I drink this black, no sugar.<br /><br />A year ago, I bought a couple of pounds online for $15/pound including shipping. I have done a lot of searching to find out why Darjeeling has seemingly disappeared. The Indian grocers are mystified, and online there is no clue. Apparently, green label Darjeeling is Lipton's most popular tea. Hard to believe if people can't actually purchase it. The name changed from Lipton Green Label to Lipton Finest Darjeeling.<br /><br />iShopIndian has 250g for $6.99 but have a flat shipping fee of $10, so one would want to buy several boxes. I have not bought through this vendor, but I plan to.<br /><br />I have a friend visiting India and hope she will find room in her suitcase to bring me back a pound (or 3). I plan to ask if there is a shortage in India.<br />Good luck finding this tea at an affordable price!

review/text: Brings out the wolf in your dog!!! My dogs went crazy for these! They last forever and they clean their teeth better than any greenie or other dental chew.  A couple of my dogs that had horrible plaque build up look like they went to the the vet for a dental cleaning!! Absolute dog utopia!!! Just keep an eye on them if you have more than one dog because if they are not used to having treats like this, they can become territorial! They realaxed after a couple of days and now they take turns. They are smelly!!! First couple of days they ate them outside but once they started turning white I let my dogs bring them in the house and they chew on them all day and night (not continuously) till they go to bed.  Also a great treat if you have a nervous/neurotic dog because this helps them channel their nervous energy.

review/text: I buy these from a different online retailer for my large (over 50lb) dogs. They absolutely love these bones! I feel that they last as long as (or maybe even longer) than the very large, long bones you can buy. I've noticed that my dogs lose interest in those types after they eat most of the end caps off. This is just one complete end, so it keeps them busy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />This WILL leave grease marks on fabrics.<br />Lots of crumbs.<br />Sometimes smaller pieces can splinter off from the bone. If your dogs are not used to eating smaller pieces of bone then I would supervise.<br />Dogs WILL hoard these and fight over them! :)

review/summary: Larabar Peanut Butter & Jelly
review/text: Peanut Butter & Jelly is comforting isn't it?  Something about that mix can bring you back to your childhood or make you think of comfort food.  Sadly, this bar isn't quite what I expected, but it still has it's good points.<br /><br />I like the Larabars, they can be quite delicious.  That being said, I think I've discovered that the ones not involving fruit (i.e. peanut butter, chocolate, etc.) are not as good tasting.  This one, I did like the taste of cherries that was in it, and the touch of salt.  But the peanut flavor just wasn't as good.  It wasn't very sweet, which is fine, but it didn't really taste peanutty either.  Just an average mix of flavors.<br /><br />The ingredients in this bar are very good though.  There's only four.  Dates, peanuts, cherries and sea salt.  That's it.  Which is incredible.  I like foods like that that only have a few ingredients and nothing overly processed.  The bar has 210 calories.  So it's not a light snack.  This is better for while you are exercising or as a meal replacement.  I had it as breakfast and it worked just fine at filling me up.  There is 10 grams of fat in the bar and 19 grams of sugar.  So like I said before, not a light snack by any means.  It does have 4 grams of fiber though, so that's healthy.  And there's a little bit of natural vitamins in there from the fruit.  Protein is 6 grams, which isn't huge, but isn't bad for after you've been running (or before!).<br /><br />I probably wouldn't get this flavor again.  I'll stick to the all fruit bars I think when it comes to the Larabars.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

I ate them during my pregnancy as a snack when i didn't feel like preparing something, but wanted something relatively healthy and quick to satisfy my hunger.  And the peanut butter & jelly is my favorite because it has a nice combination of peanut with the cherry fruit.  (unlike say cherry pie or peanut butter cookie, it has it all).

Their price was ridiculous - nearly $3 per can.  I bought a few to try -  I was amazed at the results!  I haven't seen my 75 lb. dog jump vertical with glee in many years.  I mix it with her dry food.  One can will last 3-4 days.  The difference in her level of activity and enthusiasm is unbelievable!  I went to the local store to negotiate their price on buying bulk based on what I could get it on line and the best they could do was a 10% discount.  Needless to say, this seller has a customer for the life of my dog.  Kudos to improving our quality of life at a reasonable price.  This food is so great, I have been tempted to taste the spoon!
