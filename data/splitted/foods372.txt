review/summary: Crumbly
review/text: We have been buying containers of various types of nuts for several years now.<br />90% of the time they are from the local grocery store so we can inspect them.<br />While the price was right for this 2 pack, the quality of the nuts inside was terrible.<br />They appeared to have been used by the warehouse staff to play kickball or basketball.<br />Each of the 2 containers had as many broken nuts as full unbroken nuts.<br />Very disappointing when you want to reach into a jar, grab a couple of nuts then you end up holding crumbly portions which makes more of a mess and seems more like a topping for cereal than a snack.<br /><br />I would not purchase this deal again. I prefer a whole nut for the price.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars for the price but 1 star for the quality of the product delivered.

review/text: We have been ordering these cashews for a few months now, a total of probably 3-4 shipments (2 lb units, pack of 2 each).  The quality is very consistently high with just the right amount of salt.  We enjoy them very much.  Healthy snacks!  I will definitely continue order them.

review/summary: Not as Good as Store Bought
review/text: Cashews have got to be one of my favorite nuts and I was so excited by the quantity available, and the cost!!!  Those two things cannot be beat, and are probably why I am giving such a high rating.  Despite the quick delivery, and secure packaging I was disappointed by the taste.  I've purchased Planters' Cashews with Sea Salt at my local stores before, but what I got here was not quite the same.  The flavor wasn't there.

review/text: I came back to make a purchase only to find that the price has *doubled* in the course of five months.<br />I paid $27.42 for this item from Amazon in November, 2010. I'll have to take a pass, as this price is too rich for my blood.<br /><br />Edit: I see now the price has dropped again! So my review doesn't make sense any longer. Trust me, when I wrote this, the 2-pack was $50-something.<br /><br />I upped the stars because I found the cashews to be good.

review/summary: Very good & good for you!
review/text: Husband and I ordered these on the advice of Dr. Oz, who was promoting healthy lifestyles on his show one day and how to get more energy naturally. Okay first of all they totally look like jumbo size pellets you might give a guinea pig, ha ha, but get past that, it's worth it. They really do taste pretty yummy and the odd thing is, the more often you eat them, the better they seem to taste. And the best things of all- they really do give you more energy! And in a very natural, healthy way with ingredients that are GOOD for you. And they're even vegan (who would have thunk??!) Husband is blown away that he likes these as much as he does (he's totally a greasy burger and fries kind of guy)but he likes them so much because they really work for him. He likes the tastes and he's on the go a lot during the course of his work day (he works in shipping & receiving for a large college) and he gets energy naturally from these, energy that stays with him and powers him through his day. So I'm here ordering more now. (I still snicker when I look at them, picturing the worlds largest hamster snacking on them or something, but they're pretty darn good.) Thanks, Dr. Oz!

review/text: Alright, so I was one of the few kids that flat out disliked Fruity Pebbles.  I'd ask my parents to never ever buy them for that reason.  Even today I don't like them.  An overbearingly strong sour and sugary taste is the reason why.  Plus artificial fruit put in milk just isn't a winning combination by any stretch of the imagination.  I'm not a picky cereal eater, but these just aren't very appealing to me.  Maybe you'll like them but me?  No way!

review/text: Bilberry....it sounded so...so....tasty.  I am sure that this tea is good for your health and for that reason I give it the 3 stars. Unfortunately, it smells and tastes like fish which is something I just cannot tolerate.  I tried it several times and just could not drink it.  I have a close friend who is Asian and she likes it, but she eats a lot of fish sauce so I guess her tastebuds are adapted to that taste.  Not mine.  I would also say that I am not a finicky eater (I do eat fish), and I do tolorate a lot of tastes for the sake of eating healthy, including eating things on the bitter side - but 'fishy' is hard for me to swallow!  So, for now, I will have to try something else.  Anyone know what hawthorn berry tea taste like?

Buy it from another source, it's a great tea.  I personally think it works great in combination with other teas, my favorite is a combination of four bags of this tea and one bag of plum black tea to make a gallon pitcher, which tastes great both hot or cold.

review/summary: A good variety
review/text: This is one of many varieties of fig preserves available.  It is prepared with sugar, and is a sweet preserve with large pieces of figs.  The information on the jar does not indicate nutritional values.  Figs are known to contain a fairly high amount of fiber as well as phenols which may help with weight loss.  The fig is a rich source of various minerals and has an anti-oxident value.  It has alkaline properties which may help to reduce stomache acid problems.

review/summary: Exceptional dog food!
review/text: I just started feeding my cats this brand of food and was so impressed with it and the company, I thought I would give it a try for my little mini poodle,"Joey".  He is sensitive to grains so this was perfect for him.  I mixed it last night half and half with his California Natural chicken and brown rice canned and he loved it!  Absolutely no problems with his digestive system either, which is another plus.  They have a great sale from here at Pet Food Direct right now that can't be beat, unless you go right to their site and get it on auto ship.  Then there is another 15% discount.  Pretty good savings which make it even easier to feed the best to your pets.

review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.

review/summary: PRETTY GOOD, BUT NOT LIKE PIZZA CRUST
review/text: BOTTOM LINE<br />If you are expecting a rising pizza crust, such as what you might get from standard pizza dough, then you'll need to look elsewhere.  That being said, these are pretty good in their own right.<br /><br />TASTE<br />I rather like the way these pizza crusts taste after being toasted up.  They soak in flavor from sauce or cheese well, without becoming soggy or wilted.  They have a good bread flavor on their own, also, and make a good base for a BBQ chicken or BBQ pulled pork pizza.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />I think the texture is the only thing I can complain about with these - the Schar Crusts are a little more dense than I would like.  However, this is a usual complaint about all gluten-free items.<br /><br />SIZE<br />These are definitely personal pizza sized.  With sauce, cheese, and toppings on this crust, I can usually eat about 1/2 to 3/4 of a pizza on my own.<br /><br />USES/ VERSATILITY<br />If you can expand your mind beyond making just pizza with red sauce and mozzarella, then these crusts are quite useful.  I personally love them with some BBQ sauce and chicken.  They make a nice bread/ carb base for anything I might otherwise eat on flatbread.  As a gluten-free option, these crusts are a wonderful thing to have at your disposal.

review/text: My son loves all the Ella's Kitchen fruit & veggie pouches (along with Plum Organics as well). But this chicken meal... yuck. Not only does it not smell appealing, but it tastes awful. My son is 11 months and eats everything I put in front of him, but this Ella's Kitchen chicken meal (along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Z9W4X6">Ella's Kitchen chick-chick Chicken Casserole with vegetables and rice - 7 pk</a>) is something he refuses to eat. I literally spoon it in his mouth and he sticks out his tongue and pushes it out as quick as he can.<br /><br />The only way I got him to eat this is by mixing it with fruit baby food (with a ratio of 2:1 fruit to chicken). I recommend sticking with homemade chicken. I have not tried other meat-based baby foods but given how Ella's Kitchen tends to be incredibly tasty, I can only imagine how bad other brands' food must be.

review/summary: The Second Hibiscus Soda Pop
review/text: Hibiscus is something of an acquired taste, one that I never quite acquired, so for me the best Hibiscus soda is the one that tastes the least like Hibiscus, which in this case means the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VK4D4">OOBA Hibiscus and Pineapple</a>, followed by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VK43Y">OOBA Hibiscus and Orange</a>, followed by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VIJPO">OOBA Hibiscus and Kiwi</a>, followed by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VIJFE">OOBA Hibiscus and Blackberry</a>, with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VIJA4">OOBA Hibiscus and Lime</a> coming in last, but I haven't tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VK3TO">OOBA Hibiscus Original</a> yet.<br /><br />That said I don't find any of the five I've tried undrinkable, and I'd like to try the other flavor eventually.  The biggest problem IMHO is that cutting the sugar makes the somewhat unpleasant Hibiscus flavor stronger than in the original line.  There appear to be no nutritional differences between the various flavors so pick the flavor you like (or think you'll like) the best.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I care that much for the oddly shaped plastic bottles, but with nothing else quite like them out there, they will certainly stand out on store shelves.  People who prefer their soda flavored with sugar rather than corn syrup will be pleased to know that OOBA uses cane sugar, but there isn't any diet version.<br /><br />Note: OOBA has relaunched their entire line; it first came out with 33% more sugar, larger 16 oz. bottles, and a Hibiscus with Vanilla flavor instead of Hibiscus and Kiwi:<br /><br />OOBA Hibiscus with Vanilla, OOBA Hibiscus with Lime, OOBA Hibiscus with Orange, OOBA Hibiscus Original, OOBA Hibiscus with Blackberry, OOBA Hibiscus with Pineapple.

review/text: Obviously I love the mints thats why I bought them, they are good, it was a square deal, but when I opened them in one of the individual 2 packs both packs came open inside the indivdual 2 packs and mints and dust were all over inside the package.  All in all like I said Great Mints, great deal, but open\spilled contents.  I don't see myself ordering from them again but would not discourage others from trying them out, who knows if it was ups or amazon or the companys fault for mishandeling them but I am a little upset about it.

review/summary: Take that, Girl Scout cookie mafia
review/text: The Girl Scout Samoa is possibly my favorite cookie of all time. But I'm tired of having to wait so long between offerings and paying what I find to be a bit of an exorbanant price for a pack of cookies. Enter: Keebler. These cookies are near-perfect reproductions of the Samoa, available for purchase year-round and you'll save a few bucks too.<br /><br />On the other hand, you'll have to face yourself in the mirror after taking money from the service-oriented activities of Girl Scouts and siphoning it towards another money-grubbing corporation, Kellog (don't get it twisted, these dudes in the boardroom aren't magical elves).<br /><br />So to reconcile your palette and your conscience, I recommend buying from Girl Scouts during cookie season while using Keebler for the the occasional relapse during the off-season.

review/text: I shop on both sides of the Canada/U.S. border for groceries. I am faithful to brands on both sides. I picked some of these up in the U.S. since the shape and basic ingredients are similar to a well loved Canadian Dad's cookie. They just don't even compare to Canada's Dad's Goodie Rings made by Kraft Foods. If you are a fan of this cookie and get the opportunity to pick up a pack of Dad's Goodie Rings in Canada, you will probably love them.

review/summary: Taste As Good as Girl Scout Cookies -- Without Paying for Disney World Trips
review/text: These taste just as good as Samoas and a quick google search reveals that they are in fact made by the same company.<br /><br />The best part is you can get them for around 2 bucks a package on sale at the grocery. The downside is that you won't be sending kids to Disney World but the upside is that you can use that money to give to more important needs like food kitchens, homeless shelters, women's homes, etc.

review/summary: Coconut Dreams Indeed!
review/text: I love anything coconut and chocolate and these were no exception. They're SO GOOD! The ones I got had a slightly different packaging than the one pictured but they were fresh. It's VERY easy to eat an entire pack in one sitting since each pack contains only 3 rows with 6 cookies per row. Nevertheless, for the price and speed of delivery (I got these the day after I ordered!), I would purchase again.

review/text: These were pretty good. Nice coconut flavor but with that lousy fake "Fudge Shoppe" chocolate Keebler uses. They do taste kind of like the Girl Scout Samoas, but I didn't detect much if any caramel and with the sub par chocolate I don't really agree with people who say they're as good as Samoas.<br /><br />They were fresh though, with good flavor and cookie part was still crunchy. Overall I liked these, but don't expect the flavor or richness of the Girl Scout cookies.

review/text: While I give this product a 5 because these cookies are great and a bargain compared to most local stores, I do want to make note for those concerned with trans fats.<br /><br />This product contains partially hydrogenated oils, or in other words, trans fats.  The law states that a product may be considered 'trans fat free' if the product has 0.5 trans fat grams per serving or less.  So, it could have 0.4 grams per serving and be considered trans fat free.<br /><br />Other than that, indulge and enjoy!

review/summary: NOT the same as Samoas
review/text: Girl Scout Samoa cookies are probably my favorite cookies ever, but I rarely have them because I almost never come across them anymore. I did recently try Dreyer's Samoa ice cream which was awesome, but even that has disappeared from the store freezers. I think that was a Limited Edition flavor. Anyway, when someone advised me Keebler has come out with a version, I had to try them.<br /><br />Maybe it's unfair to compare the two cookies, but hey, they look exacted the same. These cookies aren't horrible, but they have a bizarre crumbly almost grittiness about them that is off-putting. Maybe it's the way the coconut is roasted, I don't know, but it's unpleasant. And the fudge is waxy. The other thing I noticed was peanuts was listed in the ingredients. I am allergie to peanuts, and I had eaten two of these before I realized it. But that was yesterday, and I haven't had a reaction. I'm not going to blame Keebler for this. I should have read the box first. But beware. These are cheaper than Samoas, I'll give them that.

review/summary: Bootlegging at its Best
review/text: Deliciousness procured without bracing cold winds and fellow greedy Girl Scout cookie fanantics in front of Walmarts, Kmarts, supermarkets, etc. There is one small difference that I want to note: the coconut is toasted more Keebler-wise, and is thus a bit harder to masticate. (Well, actually, you are just really conscious of the difference between the GS version and the baker-elves version while chewing; this ruminating causes you to either chew more or just think that you are chewing more. Blast it!) Other than that, all else is the same. Astounding. Exercise is a must afterwards. (Note: One star detained due to coconut being pretty close to dried grass. Also, the elves' version of "Thin Mints" is right on.)

I bought 2 packages.<br />Well, I loved these so much, I decided to see if Amazing had them. Well THEY DO! 4 packs for 10 bucks! HECK YEA! I am so happy right now, I could jump for joy.<br /><br />These are the only cookies I now eat. They are perfect in every way possible. I am so thrilled Amazon carries them. I hope I can buy them forever! :D<br /><br />I LOVE THESE COOKIES! AND YOU WILL TOO!

I'm sure the chocolate will taste great once it reforms its melted self though! Just watch when you order from Euro Food Mart cause you might get melted products too or you might have to additionally pay for an ice pack to be added to your order.

review/summary: So sweet and delicious!
review/text: A friend brought me down a box of these from Canada as a hostess gift. I was not previously a fan of maple products but to be polite I gave them a try. These cookies are nothing short of addictive. They are delicious with tea or milk and every single person I know who has tried them agrees that they are impossible to resist. They are not overly maple flavored and about halfway through the (not large) cookie you get this ultra sweetness that hits your tongue and fades away quickly. The first cookie I ate in four bites (again, it's not big ... about the size of an oreo) because I was only trying it to be polite. The second went down in two bites. Two cookies is a serving and the calories are only 150 for two and the saturated fat is about what you'd expect for a cookie serving. For the full food label data go to: [...]<br /><br />Leclerc sells this cookie in its Tradition 1905 line, as well. They are the same cookies, taste-wise but the box is a little bigger ie.e more cookies and, oddly, the calorie count is 130 for 2 cookies. Oh well, either way, I love them!
