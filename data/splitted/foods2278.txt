review/summary: Dogs love it and it can probably serve as a self defense weapon!
review/text: It is HUGE, as is expected from a "mammoth" bone. We got one for out Great Dane puppy a few months ago, when she was just 4 months, and she loved it. It was so cute to watch her try to carry out, but we only give it her so often. She will do many tricks to earn access to it time and time again. Although its huge and could last forever I threw out the first one after a month or so because I didnt want her eating through the whole thing and it does not have a pleasant odor. But if you want bang for you buck and have a big/giant breed dog its a no-brainer. I recently went to the pet store with LeeLoo and bought her 2nd mammoth bone there ($17.99- amazon is superior in that area) and oh wow, after I picked it up she was soo excited, and Im lucky as she isnt a hyper-excited but a "Im-going-to-be-really-focused-on-that-bone-so-you-know-I-want-it-as-I-behave-better-than-usual-now-so-that-you-bestow-that-glorious-bone-upon-me" well.

review/summary: smokehouse natural meaty mammoth bone
review/text: Smokehouse Dog Mammoth Bone.  This dog bone is fantastic and the BEST bone ever!!  No self-respecting dog would be without this bone.  I got this for a Christmas present for my son's dog in Michigan.  (I got the same bone last year.)  Bailey is a 91 lb male lab.  My son wouldn't give the bone to Bailey last year until spring, when Bailey could tear into it outside.  Ben, my son, wouldn't give Bailey the bone inside ~ he thought it would stain the carpet.  This is such a fabulous bone, I got the same thing for Bailey this Christmas!  My grand dog loves me for sure; (I think my son does too, but is just a little disconcerted.)<br /><br />I also like the price on Amazon.  I paid much more than that, plus shipping, last year.<br /><br />Gayle Thielsen

review/summary: Yech.  Ever wonder where dead cow bones go?
review/text: This is a dead cow bone painted with greasy gravy.  Sure it appeals to big dogs, but my vet advised me highly against feeding these to my dog as they will A) upset their stomach and B) chunks can break off during chewing (80 lb german shepherd puppy) and become lodged in the dogs' throat requiring surgery.  It's not worth it - buy the rawhide chews that the dogs can't bite off pieces.  Each bone is random here - the rawhides are predictable from experience.  I returned this to amazon after it came up in a search for large rawhide bones.

review/summary: Big bone for BIG dogs
review/text: My dogs have always loved bones, but for some reason they didn't care for this one.  I don't know why, so I'm not subtracting for that.  I gave it to a neighbor for her dog, and it was a hit.  Keep in mind that this is a really big bone, so make sure it's purchased for a really big dog.  My largest dog is 20 pounds, and it was too big for him.  Also keep in mind that this is a real bone with the qualities of real bones.  Once out of the wrapper, two big pieces separated from the joint at one end of the bone I got.  This isn't a minus as long as you remember you're getting a BIG, REAL bone.

review/summary: Bone chucks are a blockage hazard.
review/text: This was an X-mas gift for my dog and he loved it.  Then a couple days later he stopped eating, threw up bile everywhere, and became very lethargic.  I took him to the vet and there in his intestine was a nice chunk of the bone.  The medical bills cost two and a half times the dog but he recovered after quite a bit of worrying on my part.<br /><br />This product is purchased for the express purpose of a dog chewing on it, but unlike rawhide it is not digestible and can cause serious problems including the need for surgery. I'm sure this is very rare, but do you really want to risk it? Babies tend to chew on things, would you give a baby something that you knew might cause it to choke?<br /><br />If you buy this product, at the very least, watch your dog like a hawk or you could be dealing with a very sick and expensive pet.

review/summary: 100% Natural Meaty Mammoth Boner
review/text: I have a pet saber tooth tiger that loves tasty snacks like bones, meat chunks, cow gristle, etc.  I was looking for something that would take time for him to chew.  The Mammoth Bone is perfect, since the woolly Mammoth is a natural prey of a saber tooth tiger.<br /><br />I wouldn't say it's "Meaty" since a bone by definition has no meat.  I guess the brown part of it is some type of ligament or chunks of skin that didn't get pulled off in the factory.  It's costly to get a bone really clean unless you use hydraulic acid, but then, it wouldn't be "100% Natural" and it'd probably be very dangerous for animals or termites to eat.<br /><br />I've tried the bone a few times, it has a zesty flavor to it, sort of like it was barbecued on an open pit flame and doused with vinegar and pork grinds.<br /><br />I don't think if your dog is a vegetarian, that he would like this because it comes from some animal part I'm guessing.  Which part, I don't yet know.  Also, there's no instructions, so if you have small Weiner dogs, you might want to grind this up before giving it to them since it can crush their aorta.

I can't find any stores in my area that sell it but I have had good experiences buying it off Amazon. Just remember when you are buying to pay attention to the shipping weight as some of the distributors use a mass picture of a 12 pack but will actually be selling a 1.5 litre. Shipping weight for a 12 pack should be around 10lbs. Oh and Guarana comes in many flavors, but Guarana Antarctica is usually the most popular/favorite.

As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.

Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!

review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.

review/summary: Don't go by the ruler--no bigger than any other ears sold by Best Bully Sticks
review/text: I have bought cow ear chews for my dogs several times from different offers on Amazon.  Some orders have had large ears, but the next purchase from the same site had "calf" ears or partial ears--but each piece counted as 1 ear.  I ordered the Punk Hollow ears because the site showed a ruler beside the ear, indicating that these ears would be bigger.  They definitely did cost more, but I was willing to pay more for the bigger ear.  But they, like others I had ordered before came from the same dealer, Best Bully Sticks.  They are packaged in the same bags, and look like any of the other ears I have ordered before.  They are no larger, and most are 4"-5" long.  Some are just ear pieces.<br /><br />My dogs do like these, but don't pay extra just because they are advertized as bigger ears--they aren't.  I bought 40 ears for $39.99; right now, I could buy the same ears on Amazon for $22.50, all from Best Bully Sticks.

Made in USA is a huge must for my dogs treats after the Chinese treat issues, and I was happy to find this company offers that. My poodle is about 8lbs and this lasted her about 1/2-1 hour of chewing. More known brands (those you would find in every grocery store) usually get abandoned by my dog after a couple minutes when she realizes she doesn't care for the taste.<br /><br />An issue I've had with other products and my dogs are upset tummys if they eat too much. These sticks have caused no issues at all!<br /><br />I greatly recommend this product for those who care about quality.

review/text: First of all, the pieces weren't as premium "Toro" part as product picture. What I received instead were less expensive "Akami" part, the part widely used for regular cheap Tuna Sashimi or Sushi in US. One of the piece were older than others judging by the color. I tasted one of the better piece as Sashimi and decided to cook the rest instead of taking them as Sashimi. It just wasn't worth it. My guess would be significant part of the price is for nice packaging and shipping. For those of you who has Whole Foods not too far, just make friends in their seafood section. Not officially but they can prepare sashimi tuna pieces for you better than this. They are still non-pemium "Akami" part but fresher and taste better than this and not to mention less expensive... Nice service for people have no access to decent seafood but this isn't for me...

review/summary: This is very weak coffee .. but it's all a matter of taste
review/text: Until recently, I've purchased Diedrich Colombia coffee, but K-cups no longer are available.  They were purchased by Green Mountain, so I mistakenly assumed that this would be a similar blend.  It is not.  It is substantially weaker and seems only to have a vague coffee flavor.<br /><br />Coffee is all a matter of taste.  So it's a bit unfair to give this 3 stars if the recommendation is being read by people who are looking for very mild coffee.  If you are, this coffee may be a 5 star for you.  But I'm still looking for a good replacement for my Diedrich Columbia coffee.

review/summary: Weak and lifeless. Worst of the Colombians.
review/text: As with most Green Mountain k-cups, this is weak and bland compared to any other k-cup. Highly disappointing. Just a splash of cream and the coffee turns almost white. If you like weak coffee, you will like this. If you like flavor, go with any other cup but this one. Even on the smallest cup setting this coffee is pathetic, and I cannot even imagine it on the other settings. The Dunkin Donuts, Puck, Starbucks, and other Colombians are far superior to this.<br /><br />Bottom line: Green Mountain Columbian is about as good as water with brown food coloring. My Siamese cat likes to drink coffee, and even he would not touch this. Good kitty.

review/summary: Notes from a Dunkin' drinker
review/text: I have been a dedicated Dunkin Donuts coffee drinker for years.  To frame how I feel about this Green Mountain Colombian K-Cup I feel it might be best to share how I go about making a cup of Dunkin' coffee when I'm at home.<br /><br />I use a coffee scoop to measure out my coffee.  To my tastes, the perfect home brew is 7 mounded scoops and 7 cups of water.  I put all this in my Cuisinart 1200 and come out w/ 6 cups of java bliss.  I use sugar and milk in my coffee; when I make my coffee as stated it get a satisfying mocha swirl of coffee and milk.  Just by sight I can tell my cup is rich.<br /><br />Now, using that as my baseline, I find this K-cup to be very satisfying.  I have tried MANY kinds of regular coffee K-cups, and this is the first one that makes a satisfying cup of full bodied coffee to my tastes.  Granted, I brew on the 6oz setting.  If you take your coffee black maybe you can get away w/ the 8oz setting.  The cup reminds me of my beloved Dunkin' (note I said reminds, its clearly not Dunkin' but I don't mean that in a bad way).  It doesn't end sharp or bitter like the very popular Coffee People Donut Shop.  It has a muted finish, reasonably full body for a K-Cup, and nice flavor.  When I pour in the milk, I can take more than a drop before turning the cup white - which tells me the cup is rich.<br /><br />Its my go to cup when I'm not brewing a pot.<br /><br />I love this stuff.  I highly recommend it if you like your drip coffee as I describe above.  Why not 5 stars?  Well, it doesn't taste like the Dunkin' I brew from a drip machine, that's why !  Its at least on the same field though ...

I have come across 3 K-cups so far that have either closed the water flow completely or allowed a very slow drip. My Kuerig has worked fine before and after those bad K-cups so I know it isn't my machine.

review/text: I'm not sure if I got a bad batch, but this does not make a good 8 oz cup like most other K Cups that I've tried.  I've had to reduce it to a 4 or 6 oz cup size to get a cup of coffee that is not like coffee flavored water.  I like a medium cup of coffee - not too strong or too weak.  I generally like the Green Mountain brand, but this is a weak, flavorless K Cup (and I have tried many, have found very few bad ones).

review/text: I am a bzzagent and received this coffee for free from bzzagent.I have been drinking my Green Mountain coffee fair trade k-cups for several days now and I am happy with them. I am so glad this coffee is fair trade but I wish the flavor was a little more to my liking - it has a little bit of a weedy after taste to it. I like how smooth it is but it has just a little back bite that would make me choose another coffee. It is not a bad drink, just not my favorite. This is definitely a medium to light roast coffee - if you want something darker, try the Sumatra Green Mountain cups. But if you like a more mild coffee that doesn't need much cream added to it, this is the coffee for you.

Like if you were looking for a not-too-strong/ not-too-light type of break. So if your that type, you'll definitely like it! Overall I enjoyed it but would've preferred a darker roast.

But with the capsules right in front of their faces, it's easy to see they can have whatever coffee their heart desires. From a cappuccino to a hot chocolate or tea, it's like a barista in my kitchen. Love it. It makes the coffee capsules very attractive and easy to store and choose. Looks nice on the counter.

review/summary: Favorite cereal of all time
review/text: I frequently have cereal for breakfast (sometimes lunch of pressed for time) and have tried many varieties. Multi Grain Cheerios is, in my opinion, the best tasting of them all -- the vitamin content is just a bonus.<br />To compare our tastes in cereal, I don't particularly like regular cheerios and I can't stand "Honey Nut Cheerios." I don't like most of the health cereals like Fiber One, though Total Raisin Bran is okay.<br /><br />Even if you don't like most General Mills cereals, I think everyoen should at least give these a shot. Don't let the "Multi grain" prefix scare you off -- they do not taste like sawdust.

review/text: Unique product--great taste. Having originally discovered this product at a specialty store during a Passover products promotion, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. A great alternative on meats, especially chicken, as well as something different as a veggie sauce or dip, the 6-pack offer with free shipping made it a real bargain. Although the first two jars were fine, when I opened the double-sealed jar three, I found it was quite rancid! As Manischewitz does not provide expiration dates nor "best if used by" dates, the customer has no way of knowing just how old the product actually is. So my vote is split--great "if fresh".

I didn't even pay attention to the fact that it now says "shipped from Bayside Candy" when I ordered them this time around, and honestly I wouldn't have cared. That is until my order arrived today! These nuts are very dark, almost burnt looking, barely covered toffee (The toffee looks dark and burnt anyway), and they taste GROSS!!! You can't taste any butter Toffee...or better yet it taste like someone over cooked it and burnt the batch!<br /><br />The nuts that you see in the picture are no more!<br /><br />Why on earth did this company think it was a good idea to switch those light colored delicious large BUTTER TOFFEE nuts you see in the picture with these tiny BURNT looking and tasting, barely covered in dark burnt toffee peanut PIECES is beyond me. I so want my money back!

review/text: This is one of the best raw almond flour products I have found. Definitely worth trying! You can even add to cooked recipes like gluten-free breads and cookies. Just make sure to keep the percentage of almond flour low as compared to sorghum, amaranth, millet, etc. Or add to fresh apples in blender with water, vanilla and cinnamon. Then dehydrate until cookie-like. No sweetener needed, but raw agave or maple syrup can be added.

review/summary: A treat for the allergy stricken! Hit or miss quality & poor customer service
review/text: We have a very strict diet (no:gluten/wheat, dairy/casein, egg, soy, chocolate among many others). This is by far the best "Allergy free" chewy granola bar out there, especially for the cost (you can get them at target for less than 3 dollars! They don't have a ton of flavor, but most of the things we eat don't so we're ok with that. I'd try a box of them before buying bulk, but as allergy sufferers this is quite a treat for us! :)<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />So, we have ordered these in bulk several times from amazon. Everything has always been great till this last shipment. at nearly 4.00 a box, I expect amazing quality, but unfortunately the first box we opened they were all hard as rocks. we contacted annies to get some help. They were worthless, and the woman we spoke to was like a robot. Worst customer service I have had in a LONG time. Needless to say, they weren't willing to do practically anything, and we are no longer purchasing their products. VERY disappointed, and will definitely be telling others about the experience. Though we loved these, but at 4.00 a box for 7 bars, and poor customer service on top of it, we're done!

review/summary: The perfect peanut flavor - a huge improvement from other bars
review/text: The are absolutely delicious, I love every one of their flavors including this one. I ordered directly from annie's site after finding out Kashi uses gmo soy in their granola bars.<br /><br />My criteria for granola needs to be 6 g sugar or less per bar, non-gmo and wholesome ingredients, and affordable. Annie's was the only one on the market to deliver all three (and I really scoured the internet and health food stores comparing many, many brands - which either had too much sugar, were not gmo free, or were healthy but ridiculously expensive). I am thrilled that they taste so good too, beside meeting my needs.<br /><br />They remind me of one of my favorite dense, chewy and divine peanut butter cookies I used to get at Quizno's 5+ years ago. SO much better than other granola bars that are peanut flavored. These can't be beat. The boxes I received were chewy, fresh, and have a real dense quality about them.<br /><br />Perfect for a snack - I often have it with fruit and cheese - I have never found any brand granola bar on it's own to suffice anyhow. In comparison kashi's were larger, drier and felt somewhat like eating flavored cardboard at times in comparison to these. FYI the reviews that state these are small - yes they are skinny, but they are dense, and only 20 calories less than most other brands, which is not much. This is my first time ordering from amazon subscribe and save so we'll see if the quality is consistent - hope so!<br /><br />*** Update:<br /><br />I am sorry to say that there is indeed a quality control issue with these. I will be making my next purchase directly from annie's (like I did my first time), which I hate to do because I prefer the subscribe and save program. The bars are noticeably less fresh, and some bars aren't even complete! I wonder, does this company pinch pennies a little too much, or have quality control problems? I hate to think they send their '2nd rate' boxes over to amazon. Really too bad.

review/text: Because I buy Annie's Peanutty bars for my little one, I like the fact that they are organic, have good protein and less sugar than Nature's Path sweet and salty peanut bars (5g vs 10g), which are my favorites. I must agree however with the reviewer below who stated that they could be hard. Recently I have been buying them at a local grocery store and they were soft enough, but the first time I bought them they were pretty hard making it almost impossible for my little one to bite off a piece. I can imagine being frustrated if I bought more than one box. I still recommend them, as my little one loves them and they are the healthier option among the other bars offered.
