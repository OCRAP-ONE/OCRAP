review/summary: Briton's #1 Tea - PG Tips
review/text: The folks in the United Kingdom drink more PG Tips tea than any other brand, and perhaps after you try it; it will be your #1 choice, too!  (By the way, the folks in Ireland drink more tea per person than in any other country.)<br /><br />PG Tips Tea and PG Tips Special Blend Tea is our home's standard tea.  There are a few specialty retailers in the USA that now offer the PG Tips Special Blend Tea and hopefully Amazon will do so soon.<br /><br />In the 1930s (the pre-digestive era in history) this tea was introduced by the name "Pre-Gest-Tee" suggesting the tea could be consumed before food was eaten, but it was the grocers who gave it the abbreviation of "PG" - and the company added "tips" (since the company uses only the best part of the tea plant, the two top leaves and bud of the tea plant to make the tea).<br /><br />Many black teas sold in the USA are graded the basic medium grade Orange Pekoe (generally the tea leaves below the top two and bud), which is one of the reasons PG Tips gets higher reviews than most other teas.  PG Tips also uses their pyramid tea bag that allows ample room for the tea to expand as it is infused.  Additionally, in my opinion, PG Tips blends only two blends, rather than blending a wide assortment, thus becoming really good at what they do.<br /><br />Here at Amazon PG Tips is priced at just over a nickel a tea bag (a good value for an imported product) when you order the 240 count boxes in a set of two, and even less expensive in the higher volumes.  PG Tips makes wonderful ice tea too, and that's good news since Americans drink about 80% of their tea as iced tea and only 20% as hot tea.  Worldwide more hot tea is consumed than iced tea, and worldwide tea is the most consumed beverage (next to water), while in the USA it is the sixth most consumed beverage (next to water).<br /><br />A very good question to ponder is "Why this is?"<br /><br />Drinking an adequate amount of tea daily is now being considered to be very good for one's health, and it is much more enjoyable to drink a really good cuppa (cup of tea), especially at the nominal cost of about a nickel a cup when compared to one of those gourmet coffee places who charge upwards of four to five dollars for a large cup of coffee.<br /><br />When we have a guest in our home we always offer them a PG Tips cuppa, and they always say they have never tasted a tea this good - thus, I rate it 5 stars for its quality and very nominal price!

review/text: I would be lost without a source for PG Tips pyramid teabags.<br /><br />This is good, everyday tea for a strong, near-lifesaving cuppa.<br /><br />Don't buy it expecting a gourmet experience (this tea doesn't come in wild ginger or peach flavours).  Buy it expecting a good normal cup of tea, miles better than Lipton's floorsweepings or Tetley's pure tannin.

review/summary: The BEST tea
review/text: I have been drinking hot tea since childhood, which is a fairly common thing for children in rural Maine. I've been faithful to Red Rose for years, until a British co-worker introduced me to PG Tips. There's no turning back for me now! The strong, robust cup of tea I get from one bag of the PG Tips has spoiled me for anything else.

review/summary: A fine and sturdy everyday tea
review/text: This is a very drinkable blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips, one of the UK's most popular brands. Although some California grocery stores (and Cost Plus World Market) stock this tea, I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag (that is available in the USA). As expected, PG Tips makes a stronger brew. Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag. I drink my tea black, but PG Tips is clearly robust enough to maintain character with milk or sweetener.<br /><br />PG Tips is a sturdy, straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton's. It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands.<br /><br />PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. Does it make better tea? I don't know, but it is a point of differentiation.<br /><br />HINT: PG Tips also makes a Special Blend black tea that is only slightly more expensive in stores. I much prefer the Special Blend to their regular black tea. The PG Tips Special Blend is a very hardy and rich breakfast tea. The Special Blend is more sensitive to longer steeping times (I usually steep mine less than 3 minutes), but I find the taste more complex and satisfying.<br /><br />Cognoscenti typically prefer loose tea. Tea bags contain the less expensive "fannings" or "dust," remains from processing loose leaf tea. And with some others brands of tea (not PG Tips), many people can taste the paper used in the bag.<br /><br />If you (like I) sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags, I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea. And, I more strongly recommend their Special Blend as a hardy and rich breakfast tea.

review/text: Before I tasted PG Tips I was drinking Twinings Irish Breakfast (IB) tea which is quite good. However, PG Tips  is as good as Twinings IB and costs just half the price. It is a blend of Assam, Ceylon and Kenyan tea. I have no clue what IB tea is, it does not say anything on the box.<br /><br />I am switching to PG Tips from now.

review/summary: A great everyday tea.
review/text: It's really the perfect all-rounder.  It's got a great flavor, it's incredibly smooth and doesn't have the absurd amount of tannins that some other teas to -- Tetley, for example.<br /><br />Currently, this tea is a little over 3 dollars per 40 pack, which is a pretty fair deal as it is an imported item.  I'd say give it a shot, as long as you're into honest black tea.  If you're into those flavored teas where they add a bunch of natural flavors to cover-up the horrible outhouse quality tea leaves, well...to each their own, but in the meantime man up and try some PG Tips anyway!<br /><br />Really though, it's a very approachable tea, you'll enjoy it.

review/text: This is the best tea available and I am so glad I have found it available on Amazon.  Back in the day I used to have to drive all over town to find an English store and then pay exhorbitant prices for some English tea.  You might guess I am English and a total tea junkie but it has to be P.G. Tips because it is the greatest.  It always tastes great, you can make it mild or strong, add honey or milk or sugar and still have great tea flavour. I drink four or five pots of tea a day and P.G. Tips never dissapoints.

review/text: Always looking for hearty, British "lorry lay-by" tea.  Lived in Scotland for a year and always enjoyed the strong, warming flavor of a cuppa right from the giant stainless pots.  Tetley's British Blend comes close, but as the reviews suggest, Tips is tops.  Quite likely that it WAS the tea I was drinking.  Brewed according to the rules - warmed pot taken to the boiling water and steeped for 5 minutes - it is rich and flavorful (flavourful?) without being bitter or harsh.  The real deal and my British "madeleine" that brings back the gray sky, dreary weather; fogged windows; the smell of wet wool.

review/summary: .06 Per Cup = Winning!!!
review/text: There are over 50 reviews already on here that will tell you why PG Tips is an amazing tea and why you should buy it, so I thought I would take a different approach.  My story is that I was walking through the grocery store looking to buy some standard cheapo tea (Bigelow or something similar) and the red flag stating "Englands No1 tea" seemed to jump out off the box at me.  Maybe this is a stereotype, but I've always figured that England was known for consuming a lot of tea.  So in my opinion, if it was good enough for the them, it was more than good enough for me.  I tried it, and LOVED it.  I loved it so much that I found myself buying it WAY too frequently at my local grocery store paying their high prices.  When I saw this on amazon, I knew that buying in bulk had its advantages, but at SIX CENTS a teabag, HOLY COW!!!!  Winning!!!<br /><br />There is nothing cheaper in life that has made me happier than waking up and enjoying a great cup of tea at a great price.<br /><br />Yummmmm!

review/text: Leave it to the British to produce the best tea on the whole planet. I don't know anything about the types of leaves it contains, but I know that I look forward to getting out of bed each morning and starting the day with PG Tips. If you have a sensitive stomach, you already know that both coffee and tea can sometimes leave you nauseated with the acidity level. Lipton, Tetley, and most other US supermarket brands are guilty as charged on the upset stomachs. Not so with PG, and it has a smooth, lovely taste that is delicious to the last drop whether you steep your tea for exactly 3 minutes, or if you leave your tea bag in the cup like I do. The only other tea I have found comparable is Harney & Sons Big Red Sun in the red tin, costing $8 per 40-count box. With Amazon's subscription I am stocked for the next 6 months at a fantastic price. I bought the 40-count boxes so that I could leave more tea sealed for a greater amount of time; if you go through 3 or 4 cups a day, look into boxes with larger counts. I store my open box in a ziplock bag in the cupboard and it is good every single time. It really is the best English Breakfast/British Breakfast style tea available, and you will never go back to Lipton's floor sweepings after trying this tea.

This tea I can drink brewed to a nice dark brown color for about 5 minutes and no sugar is required. Love the tea and cannot wait for another sale to come around to stock up!

review/summary: Very good, considering the price
review/text: This tea is the best reasonably priced bagged tea on the market. It is cheap enough to let me drink a good cup of tea in the morning, but it also tastes really good. Better than any other bagged teas in the price range. It is very classic tea, and strong. There is a very slight smokiness, but not very much. Yes, there are better bagged teas (Yorkshire Gold is one), but they're much more expensive.<br /><br />It gives me a good start to the day for a reasonable cost and with good taste. Need I say more?

review/text: PG Tips to my mind is the single best every-day tea in the English-speaking world. It's not Twinings, Taylors, etc. There is no pretense about it. And it is certainly not Lipton's which sadly is the American equivalent because it's the most popular supermarket brand. It's just perfectly full-flavored black tea which satisfies deeply.

review/text: PG Tips is just the tea I was looking for! I had been loyal to the Empress tea blend from the Fairmont Empress hotel in Victoria BC (wonderful high tea service there), but with the economy changing it became unaffordable to purchase it directly from Canada. Anyway, this is a fine comparable tea blend with a smooth rich flavor. Much stronger and more delicious than American teas. I love it especially with milk and sugar. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a stronger, richer tea!

review/summary: I C why PG is #1
review/text: I am not a fan of Lipton or Tetley teas and rarely drink either.  If I'm out and served these as iced tea, that's fine, I just don't order these when they are the only choice for hot tea.  After reading reviews and researching the company, I ordered PG Tips Black Tea and I'm sure glad I dove into this liquid.  Watching their ad on YouTube actually persuaded me to give it a try because I enjoyed the humor.<br /><br />Packaging offers minimal waste in thin cardboard and cellophane.  Yay!  Tea bags are slightly perforated for easier flow and a pouch like shape with no string attached.  Yay!  Bags contain more tea than most other bags.  Yay!  I place one bag in my trustworthy Numi Signature Glass Teapot and pour in boiling water.  The leaves infuse immediately and there is no residual powdery tea when I spoon out the swollen teabag about 3 or 4 minutes later.  The color is rich, deep amber that leans toward red.  The flavor is rich as well, with no tannins like I get from other "table" teas.  Because I don't like my tea very strong, I pour some of the liquor into my cup, add more boiling water, and have about 3 to 4 cups of hot tea from the one teabag over a period of an hour or so.  Each tastes fresh and full, without tannins developing.  It also makes great iced tea by brewing 2 or 3 teabags in a pitcher, removing the bags and sprinking in a couple packets of Splenda to dissolve, then adding loads of ice.  Again, the color is beautiful.<br /><br />PG Tips aids in my digestion, too, but I tend to have it following meals rather than prior to eating as it was originally marketed in England.  I've added milk and was reminded of Thai tea after sweetening it in the cup.  So many times the color of tea looks gray when milk is added, so it's retention of the lovely amber color is another advantage of PG.  I have not tried this yet, but I imagine it would also be great with lemon and honey, especially when I'm suffering with a cold.<br /><br />I'm happy Amazon offers these bags in so many options and look forward to summertime when I'll be preparing pitchers and serving this as tall refreshing glasses of fresh iced tea.  It's more economical than my usual premium teas, too!  I only wish Amazon would offer it in the decaf variety.

review/summary: Not Strong Enough!!! Lacks Full Flavors & Sophistication
review/text: Ok, I've been drinking a variety of hot teas usually with cream & a tad of sugar since the late 1970's... before that iced tea...<br /><br />Amazon did sell this at an excellent price 'IF' you subscribe & it arrived promptly with a VERY FRESH date... expiration in 2013 for best flavor (bought in August 2011).<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea is too weak & too smooth... I have to use 3 tea bags per 10-11oz cup of water to get some strength infused into it for 10 minutes! I recommend Lifeboat Tea (also from UK) over this or Scottish Breakfast if you want even more strength & full flavors.<br /><br />If you don't want strong Full Flavors or Sophistication, then this tea is a buy for smooth & subtle drinking... good for a tea party... to eat little cakes & scones with it. Better it be Lifeboat or Scottish Breakfast, imo, for my tea parties. :-)<br /><br />Right now, my ideal blend would be a combination blend of Scottish Breakfast AND Lifeboat... Lifeboat needs a tiny kick of strength & flavor from the Scottish tea... that's my perfect cuppa tea...<br /><br />If you know a better stronger blend that can top that combo taste, then please comment to this post... and Thanks!!!

review/text: Very good and high quality tea blend for milk tea.  But, for me, just drinking straight up had the same effect of Mexician Water on First time Tourists.  It was alittle too dark and found some tea oil on top after seeping for 5 minutes.  Overall, I would say this tea is like higher grade Lipton Yellow Label.  The triangluar bag made a big difference although I wish the bags came w/ strings so I can dunk.

review/text: English tea tastes a lot different than Asian tea. Now I know. I thought tea is tea, there cannot be that much of a difference in taste, but oh boy there is. Having tasted Asian tea, especially the ones brewed from whole tea leaves, English tea just can't compare. Maybe I should say "tea bag" tea just can't compare to "tea leaf" tea. It's just not fragrant or flavorful at all.<br /><br />If you comparing Lipton versus this, then yeah, this has a bit more depth of flavor. But if you're an Asian tea lover, then this is going to disappoint.

Unfortunately, when the package arrived, I found some of the boxes to be squashed, and the rest had a lot of loose tea on the outside trapped in the wrap, which gave them a dirty look and made them unsuitable for gifting.

review/text: To me, these are some of the worst teas I've ever had.  I can only guess that most of the people who love PG Tips have never had real Asian/Chinese teas.  PG Tips are way too strong (in a bad way) and leave a "scratchy" feeling in the mouth, which is THE one thing that should NOT happen after drinking tea.  The aftertaste is pretty much non-existent.  I thought maybe these were meant for adding milk and sugar so I gave it a try - it didn't improve the taste at all.<br /><br />I can understand that people have different preferences and such but I didn't think they would be THIS different!<br /><br />Anyway, I won't be buying these teas ever again.

review/summary: Wow, raw cacao will test your taste buds
review/text: These beans are in great shape (very whole, look good) and are vacuum-packed really well. I have had other cacao beans (from Trader Joes) that were very dry, and I THINK a bit easier to eat because they were more crunchy/crackley where as these are a bit fresher, with a hair more moisture in them so you taste the bean more -- at least it seemed that way to me.<br /><br />I think that means these are fresher, but really, everything else about "should I get these" boils down to your ability to eat cacao beans.<br /><br />The taste is not for the unprepared.<br /><br />If you have some bakers chocolate laying around, go try that to get the idea. There is nothing "chocolate" about these (for folks that aren't familiar with cacao beans). These taste a lot like eating giant, burned, acidic, coffee beans. The taste is sharp and I find it pretty unpleasant.<br /><br />I do have friends that eat raw cacao a lot (health nuts) and think it's a "good" taste.<br /><br />If you are already familiar with cacao and are trying to decide on a bean, I'd recommend these. As state the beans are in great shape, very whole, well packaged and seem to be quite fresh. No stale/dried out taste.<br /><br />I personally wouldn't get these again just because I think I hate cacao beans, not because there is anything wrong with these beans.

review/summary: Best cocoa beans
review/text: My whole family loves those cocoa beans; in fact, I am going to order 2 more packages of those once I finish typing this review, because they didn't even last for a week because they ate them all, not leaving me enough to enjoy them.  I love chocolate, but having the processed chocolate, even the extra dark one, leaves me feeling guilty, and, I am not a sugar fan: yes, the dark chocolate bar does still contain sugar. I am used to the cocoa bean taste, since I have had them before, and I used to get them from a chinese store, but, they were packaged in South America. Now they closed the store and they opened Fresh and  Easy store instead, but, they don't carry them. It is best consumed with almonds and walnuts. But, whoever did not have the cocoa beans, need to get used to them first.<br />They were shipped very fast, and were nicely packaged. The beans were whole and fresh; that is the main reason that I am ordering from this vender again, plus they were not so expensive, although in the Chinese store it cost $2.99 for 9 ounces of cocoa beans. Still, it is a good buy if I can't find them in the local stores.<br />I would recommend those beans to anyone who has tried cocoa beans before, or, if you are new to those, why not try the best and the freshest. I will also try to add a video response next time; I don't have any more cocoa beans to record now.

review/text: I didn't believe the hype I had heard about cacao beans until I bought them.<br />How good they taste is a subjective question , I think they taste great. Someone who is very picky may argue they are bitter (not this brand - ALL cacao beans, by nature).  Those people who would deny the health benefits of these because of a mild bitter taste on your tongue for 20 seconds, is better off with a bag of M&M's anyway.<br />For anyone else who eats smaller quantities of food to maintain your physique, or are on a diet etc - your really going to like these a lot. When you are ready for proof they work, try the following experiment: eat about 5 of these an hour before your usual workout. compare your performance with, and without these in your system. Then you'll know what the hype is all about.

Because I keep them in the car as an emergency caffeine source.  Unlike diet coke they don't freeze in the winter and pop out of their container, making a mess.  Unlike chocolate-covered espresso beans they aren't tasty enough to tempt me into overeating them.  In short, they are a caffeinated "snack" that I can put down after I've had enough.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168DNZ4">Ecuadorian Truly Raw Whole Cacao Beans, Organic, 16oz - Pacari</a><br />Some people may like these beans; I don't, and that single star reflects this fact. They're just too bitter for my taste, but if you happen to like bitter, feast yourself. However, I do have to say that I have enjoyed other cacao beans before--nibs, that is--and maybe that's the difference. With nibs, at least the ones I bought before, there is a bitterness, but only enough to limit your consumption to a handful at a time. That's why they satisfied. That's what I liked about them. With peanuts, or almonds, or just about any good-tasting nut, I can't stop.  With the nibs, I found that one handful, but no more, to be oddly satisfying. However, one or two beans was the limit imposed by this product. In short, this is but another example of the truth of the Latin phrase, "de gustibus non est disputandum."

review/text: Chocolate Chip cookies have become kind of boring. So I thought I would try something a little different. Coconut Chocolate Chip sounded interesting so I gave them a try.<br />They taste really good. Not great, but very good.<br />They would taste better if there were a bit more coconut in them and the chocolate chips were actually semi-sweet as the label says. They didn't seem sweet at all. The ingredient list is supposed to list ingredients by the percentage of each ingredient in the product. It lists coconut before semi-sweet chocolate but they don't taste like there is more coconut than semi-sweet chocolate chips.<br />Perhaps I received a batch that had more chocolate than coconut. Large volume producers do have such product variances. They still taste good but not as good as I was hoping.<br />This is the second shipment I have had and the previous one did taste better.<br />I wonder if they have an M&M cookie with coconut? If so, that would make the "chocolate chips" not quite as bitter as the semi-sweet chips. I wouldn't want to go all the way to milk chocolate chips, which are being made by Mrs Field, Pepperidge Farm, Schmerty's, Scotts (white milk chocolate), Seattle's Favorite and others since that would make the cookies too sweet.<br />But the only M&M cookies I can find are made by Scotts and they don't have one made with coconut.

review/text: This pretty good stuff i like the nuts they are sweet round and succulent. The creamy toffee dripped all over the nuts creates a sensation of oral delight. This product will explode in your mouth with a hot liquid of butter oozing down your throat and don't forget to suck on the nuts for a delightful taste. Make sure you get every drop of the toffee and youll be in heaven.

review/summary: I love this stuff, and so does my Grandma
review/text: Crunch. Nom. Crunch. nomnomnom...<br /><br />I remember finding this stuff as a kid in the cabinet. I would eat it piece by piece and leave all the nuts in the bottom. My favorite part was the popcorn. That was fine for my Grandma, because she LOVED the nuts, especially on Butter Pecan ice cream. Then we couldn't find it in the stores anymore in the cans or the small sizes, and the big ones always went bad instantly.<br /><br />My Grandma's birthday came around, and I was just at a loss for what to get her. I also hate giving people things that they expect--I really like to give them things that make them smile but that don't add more clutter to their lives.  I saw this pop up on Amazon and I had to buy it. I ordered it as a gift and it was delivered to her door. She called me laughing. She said the UPS man came and she figured it would be her birthday present, but she didn't know what it was. Then he handed her this big box, and she was worried she would drop it, but it was very lightweight. When she opened it up, there were all these boxes of Crunch 'n Munch. She said it was so delicious, and that it was so funny having this big box arrive on her step.<br /><br />I can just picture her reaching into the cupboard and pulling out a yummy little snack box of popcorn.<br /><br />And as for her picky eating? When I went to visit at Thanksgiving, it was all gone, so it must have been good!!!

review/summary: Great price and LOVE the smaller packaging!
review/text: This is the same delicious Crunch 'n Munch that you remember as a kid. Note that these boxes are SMALLER than the standard boxes (8oz.)that you buy at Walmart or a regular grocery store. Price-per-oz is the same as Walmart, but I LOVE the smaller sized boxes (these are 4oz) because they are more easily portable and I think it stays fresher since you don't feel like you have to eat the whole box in a sitting since it's not as much as the larger boxes.<br /><br />The shipping took awhile, but it was properly packaged and the product tastes great. I'm excited to have the smaller boxes on hand.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-smaller sized boxes (also better for portion control)<br />-free shipping (saves time and gas money for me)<br />-Same price-per-oz as the larger boxes (usually smaller quantities cost more)<br />-Same delicious product that I love<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Shipping took almost a month

review/text: I bought these for my wedding I added them to the champagne. They added such a nice touch to the glasses. However, you must read on how to set them up. I don't know if maybe they were not set up right, but they started to float after a while and they were upside down. The point of these is for it to sit at the bottom of the glass like a blooming flower. Either way, the flavor it added to the champagne was delicious. And if you want more flavor, just add more of the liquid to the glasses. Oh, and you could eat the flowers! I still think they were worth it.

review/text: This is a great product and adds a bit of class and distinction to a glass of white wine or bubbly.  Would only use one per glass as they cost nearly a dollar per flower after paying for shipping on the large bottle.  Also, I would not suggest using this for a high quality glass of wine or bubbly.  Very good addition to a cheaper wine or champaigne as you wouldn't want to change the taste of a high quality/high cost wine or champaigne.  Looks beautiful floating in a glass and reminds me of the fighting beta fish when floating in the glass.

review/summary: Strange sized jars - but delicious marmalade
review/text: The Tiptree brand is second to none, in my opinion. Those folks have been making jams and marmalades for decades in Essex. They are very well known in the UK.<br /><br />I consider myself to be a bit of a marmalade freak. I have tried many different varieties and this is the second best marmalade in the world. (The very best is my Mum's home brew variety - but unfortunately you can't buy that!).<br /><br />The tiny jars are a bit odd, but that just means you'll have to keep opening jars all the time to get more of this delicious marmalade. Please Amazon, get some normal-sized jars of this stuff!<br /><br />The ingredients of this marmalade are very simple - oranges and sugar and maybe a bit of citric acid. No corn syrup!! You can tell. This stuff is heavenly. Did I mention that I love this marmalade?? 5 stars seems too low.<br /><br />By the way, Tiptree make other jams such as raspberry, strawberry and blackcurrant. Have you ever seen blackcurrant jam in the US? I haven't. Black jam ("jelly") in the US typically means grape. But try the Tiptree blackcurrant if you can find some, it is extremely good as are all the Tiptree jams. And no, I don't work for Tiptree.<br /><br />Oh, one other thing: if you are going to eat this marmalade, do yourself a favor and spread it on some decent bread. If you use it on Wonderbread you might as well throw it out the window. Bread by Turano (they have it in the Chicagoland area, don't know how easy it is to get hold of elsewhere) is a very good choice. Enjoy!

review/text: After reading the review of this product, I couldn't wait to open one and try it.  Well, I opened one today, and I must say I was disappointed.  The name brands in the grocery stores are quite a bit better.  There were very few bits of orange rind in it and it had a rather bitter taste which I was not used to in the other marmalades I have tried. I am probably not the "marmalade expert" that the other reviewer is, but this is my honest opinion of the product. Perhaps I would like the other flavors better, but, I'm not willing to try such a large amount in case I don't care for them.

review/text: I first found this product at a local supermarket.  As usual, when I like something, it gets discontinued from the store!!  I tried local Italian markets and one tried to order a case from his supplier but what came in was not right. On a whim I googled "Gia Russa" and ended up at Amazon.com! I never thought of looking here for grocery products!  And the price, even with shipping, was less than I was paying at the market! The key to the excellence of this product is that it is an EGG PASTA.  Two minutes in water, drain, a little melted butter and alot of lemon juice plus salt and pepper is all you need.  Don't cover this pasta with a tomato sauce - you want to taste the noodles.One nest per person is an ample portion.

I have so much that I can put some in tupperware containers and "Ferment" my kitty toys in the stuff for DAY'S.<br /><br />Then I take it out... shake off the residue and ....<br /><br />It gives my Kitties boring toys "NEW LIFE."

review/summary: Fracaso total!
review/text: Mi gato no le hace caso en lo mas minimo, se lo apliqu&eacute; en su juguete y nada de nada, no se puso loco, ni corri&oacute; como decia el producto.<br />No se si se deba a que mi gato tiene 8 a&ntilde;os y ya no le interesa o que pasa, la verdad no entiendo.<br />Ahora no se que hacer con el producto.
