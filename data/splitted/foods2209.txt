review/summary: $70!
review/text: It may not be fair for me to review this.  I sent it out to Uncle Johnny just yesterday.  But when I think about it, that box of dried fruit and nuts can't be all that big, and certainly not worth $70.  But somehow that's what my total came out to by the time I was at the end.  I think it was the shipping that did it.  I love my uncle Johnny, but that really hurt.  I found something that looked nice and was in my price range and then once I click "submit" I got a total of $69.+!!!  I was LIVID!  And I can't help but muttering to myself over and over now- if I'm going to give out $70 to someone as a gift, I certainly want them to get $70 worth of something.  So, I guess in the long run, it's not the product I'm reviewing, it's the shipping scam.<br />And these businesses who started with a wonderful idea, have turned our sympathies to just that- A SCAM.  I can not longer support them.  I'm out.  There are other ways I can say I love you, or I'm sorry your wife died.

review/summary: The best cashews I've ever ate!
review/text: I was lucky enough to receive five bags of yumnuts for free and sadly we ate them all already! These are truly the best nuts I have ever had. They seem barely roasted--enough to enhance the flavor, but the color of the nuts is still really close to the color of raw cashews. They are nice and big and the flavor is delicious. It's not overwhelming or hot. I wish these nuts weren't so expensive, though!

review/summary: Fantastic for so many reasons
review/text: I think they call these Easy Cajun because there's essentially no spicy heat.  But being a capsicum super taster, I'm completely fine with that.  These cashews are roasted the right amount -- not too much.  And they're coated with a spice mixture that gives them a lot of fantastic flavor.  100% natural with no corn syrup, no food coloring.  The coating stays on the cashews, so there's little if no powdery residue.  Another reason these are great for serving at parties, in the car, and on the run.

review/summary: Good. Great when tweaked.
review/text: If you follow the instructions on the back of the package, you will get a pretty good sauce, a little grainy, a little bit sweet, and an ok cheese flavor with just a hint of heat. Definitely better than most nacho cheese sauces you could get in a can. Here's how to turn this into something you'd pay a lot more money for:<br />1. Heat up 6 tablespoons of water in the microwave with 1 tsp of canned diced green chiles for 1 minute.<br />2. Whisk in 2 tablespoons of the cheese sauce mix and whisk until the sauce starts to thicken.<br />3. Put 1 slice of American cheese on top, I use a deluxe or deli style, and microwave for 30 seconds.<br />4. Whisk until the cheese blends in. You now have an awesome cheese sauce with only around 130 calories.<br /><br />Prepared like this, the cheese sauce is excellent over a baked potato or as a dip for tortilla chips. Heck, I could eat it with a spoon. I deducted 1 star because I really feel that this cheese sauce needs the diced green chiles and the American cheese in order to be a 5 star sauce. I probably wouldn't use it often by itself, but with my modifications, it really is delicious and not too high in calories. Plus my modifications don't add much to the price. A can of diced green chiles will set you back a buck and deluxe American cheese is usually $3.50 for a pack of 24 slices.

review/text: I have used many brands of dry cheese mix in the past only to find out they taste like the usual Kraft mac & cheese mix. This one gives You more of a real Mexican flavor with a touch of peppers. I use it in many dishs and it is great in Your meat loaf mixture. As a topping I find it is much better mixed with milk instead of water. I tends to thin down a bit after sitting though.

review/summary: Love 'em worms
review/text: The original gummy worm. This last package, which I take to work to share was borderline stale. They were leathery and had molding debris stuck on bunches of them. I remember when your worms never had warts, these had lots and should have been rejected. I think I'm gonna stop buying this brand.<br /><br />I have seen on TV how these are made which explains why they are so expensive. The white warts that get stuck to them I believe is from molding debris, based on the TV program (How It's Made, season 1). Usually these are top notch but lately they are B- or C- grade.

review/summary: squiggly worms that giggle in the bag
review/text: I'm surprised I haven't seen a commercial yet that shows gummy worms wiggling out of the bag and dancing on the grocery store floor, lol.  Seems like a fairly obvious and outrageous idea that would be wonderful and whacky to implement but, to my knowledge, hasn't been used yet.  Anyway I remember 5th grade science class and how this one teacher came up with an idea to put gummy worms in chocolate cake mix and we'd pretend it's real worms in soil.  She'd pass out cups of worms/cake mix to the kids and we'd all laugh.  That actually encouraged me to pass science class that year, believe it or not and I wasn't even a fan of gummy worms back then!  It's true, I didn't actually appreciate the fine flavor until I was about 20.  Before then, all gummy-related things would stick to the roof of my mouth and cause unsatisfaction.  Pick up this bag of Trolli Gummy Squiggles today so your friends or students can share the same joys.

review/summary: Fast & Good
review/text: The Gummi Squiggles came fast and I was surprised on how quick. The price was great, however, it was MISLEADING since the delivery charge was very high and I was charged for every bag I purchased even though they were packed together.  In the end, the price was the same as every other company that sells these. I just believe it is kind of misleading on how they put a price of $9.99 and then charge close to $7.oo per delivery on every bag while other companies charge $14 and only have a $3 delivery. That decision is up to you, but watch your delivery prices before you purchase.<br /><br />Everything was fine, but one thing to remember is that it is probably better to order these in the Fall, Winter or early Spring because the candy becomes way, way too soft when it is delivered in the heat of the summer.  I had one right out of the bag as soon as I got them, but the texture and the taste of the candy was weird so I put them in my cabinet in a cool area and they firmed up and were ready to go.

review/text: My dog has been sick for several days after eating these treats...she's finally acting almost normal again today after 24 hours off these treats.  The sicker she became, the more treats I gave her (duh) trying to cheer her up to make her feel better and of course the worse her symptoms became.  I can't say 100% it's related but the coincidence is too large to ignore.  They also happen to be distributed by Del Monte, the same company who distributes the Milo's Kitchen chicken jerky treats that have made so many dogs sick.  Do your pets and yourselves a favor...Google homemade dog treats and bake a batch of your own.  It's inexpensive and healthy...and safe.

review/summary: best dog food!!!
review/text: I've been giving this brand of dog food to my small dogs (10-12 pounds each), since the tainted dog food incident a few years ago (it takes them probably 6-8 months to go through 30 pounds).<br /><br />When I got a new puppy (doberman), I thought this would be a little expensive, since he eats a LOT.  I looked through PetCo at just about all the different dog foods around this same price (I didn't really look at the ones that were more, since I'm pretty happy with the food). I found that this was the ONLY dog food in this price range that had the first TWO ingredients being meat (or meat by product). In fact, many of the dog foods (the kinds that you find in the grocery store) actually had the FIRST ingredient being filler. In case you don't know, the largest quantity ingredient is listed 1st and so on down to the smallest.<br /><br />He did have diahrea for the first couple of days, but that is because I did not transition him to this food.  Sadly, he had moved from one house to another house to our house within 36 hours, and I did not get information from the original owner about what he had been eating. I mention this mostly to refute the other lower rating - most dogs need to transition in foods or they will get diahrea. So typically, one should mix the old dog food with the new one, in decreasing increments over about two weeks, until the dog is eating 100% of the new food.

I have price compared buying from Amazon and the "big-name" pet store and more times than not Amazon has been less expensive.

Her coat was kind of dull, but we transitioned her to Blue large breed puppy as soon as she moved in.  Her coat was shiny within a week or two.  She likes the food, although the feeding guidelines have been a little low for her activity level so I feed her about a half a cup more.  She has a bit of a sensitive stomach with treats, but she has been fine on this brand of food and treats.  She is now just shy of 8 months and I'm still loving this food.

review/summary: Shiny puppies!
review/text: We started buying this food which was recommended by our vet.  When we brought our dog home from the shelter at 4 months old we knew he would be a good size -he's a Weimaraner mix. He transitioned well to this food.  He became a shiny, beautiful, happy boy. Eight months later when we adopted another 4 month old puppy (Black Lab this time)  as a playmate there was no doubt which dog food he would be getting. The Lab seemed to have had a harder time before being adopted. He was underweight, with his ribs and hip bones showing. He also had quite a case of dandruff. After a couple of weeks eating this food he was putting on weight and became more sleek and healthy.<br /><br />Months later, both dogs are in peak physical condition. Bright eyes, shiny coats, energetic and full of life. This truly is the best dog food I've ever used in all my years as a pet parent.<br /><br />/even the poop is better<br /><br />Buying on Amazon is great, too. The big box pet stores don't keep enough in stock to be sure you can always get a bag when you need it. Amazon never runs out and brings it to your house. Brilliant!

review/summary: My dogs love it, and my cats do, too!
review/text: Blue Buffalo is one of four brands I rotate through with my four big dogs.  This puppy kibble is on the small size, and the cats steal a few of these from the dogs when the dogs aren't looking.  None of my dogs has ever gotten sick or suffered from loose stool with this product.  There are no cheap food colorings.<br /><br />My German shepherd dog actually eats this stuff, too, and she's known to shy away from dry food.<br /><br />Amazon will periodically have this on sale for under USD 38, so watch the price on this.  When it sells for under USD 50 you are getting a better deal through Amazon than from the big pet store, but pet food retailers and your local feed store may offer this at a better price.

review/summary: Great Food
review/text: Great ingredients and solid stools. Our puppy loves it and it's nice to know that I am giving her something that does not contain a bunch of corn and fillers. Make sure to transition very slowly, especially if previouse food is lower in protien and nutritional value, as a fast switch can lead to upset tummy and loose stools. We transitioned slowly over about a 2-3 week period and our pup had no problems. Her coat is soft, fluffy, and shiny.....Blue Buffalo is a great product.

review/summary: AMAZING!
review/text: I can't say enough good things about this food. Our puppy (American Staffordshire) was on Puppy Chow when we got her. After reviewing many different foods I decided to switch her to Blue Buffalo. We did a slow transition mixing first a quarter cup, then half, and so on until she was fully switched. Her stool was fine and her coat immediately began showing the difference. Her energy picked up and she loves it! We also mix in a tablespoon or so of the Blue Buffalo canned food which just adds to the flavor for her. This is a great product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality dog food at a reasonable price.

review/text: Transitioned our new puppy (Golden Retriever) to this food over about 2 weeks and he had no trouble with it at all. Plus, he absolutely LOVES it. His coat is starting to look a little more shiny and smooth than it had been about a month ago (maybe this is just his summer coat coming in, maybe it's the food, who knows) but I like knowing that Blue Buffalo is full of quality ingredients, has no negative digestive or energy level effects for my dog, and that he enjoys it. That's good enough for me. I'll plan on using this until it's time for some adult food.

review/text: When I got my puppy I started feeding him Purina One, thinking that I was buying really good dog food.  But then I started reading labels and information about dog food brands.  This led me to Blue Buffaloe.  Not only do they appear to make one of the best dog foods, and by that I mean healthiest, my puppy cannot get enough of this food.  That is saying something too because he was never a fan of Purina One or Eukanuba.

So when i first bought my puppy he was used to purina then a rep at petsmart highly recommended Blue buffalo because my dog was a German Shepherd puppy he needed alot of nutrients. so at first he had loose stools for about a week. Then his white coat was lush and shiny and soft. his stools are solid now. and he looks and feels healthy. My 4 month White German Shepherd is 40 lbs and is very happy with Blue Buffalo.

If you do decide to change from your current brand, remember to do it over a 3-4 week period and mix the old with new gradually. If you want to know the history of this great brand, go to their website. I wish the company was public, I would own their stock.

review/text: My Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy loves this stuff. He initially was eating Eukenuba from the breeder, but once we got home we found that the large pieces were hard for him to break up at 8 weeks and he didn't seem to be too excited for meals. While he was in a new place away from his litter mates, once we starting mixing his food with the Blue Buffalo his appetite really picked up. We transitioned him over the past 15 days and soon he will be on Blue Buffalo 100%. Luckily, Amazon sells this great food at a reasonable price and with free Prime shipping.

review/summary: Gave my puppy very loose stools
review/text: We began feeding our 10 week old German Shepherd puppy Blue Buffalo Large Breed Puppy food, transitioning her from Purina very slowly over the course of several weeks.  Initally she seemed to do fine but then began getting very loose stools. We couldn't even pick up after her.  It was terrible. We took her to the vet for tests, added pumpkin to her diet, vet gave her probiotics, nothing seemed to help. After about 6 weeks of this (and working unsuccessfully with my vet to find a solution)I switched foods.  In about 3 days her stools were nice and solid.  While the ingredients in Blue look good on paper , it just wasn't good for her digestive system.  Now feeding California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and she's doing great on it.

review/text: The product description and listed shipping weight (12.7 pounds) made me think I was getting an amazing deal on a 12-pack of green olives, but I only received one jar.  Too good to be true, I suppose!<br /><br />I also took a chance on the Kalamata olives from the same seller (PTOmart/Saucier Enterprises, though I see that the seller for the green ones is now listed as Tropical Traditions), which didn't mention 12 jars but listed the ITEM weight at 10.8 pounds.  But the SHIPPING weight is listed at 10.1 OUNCES, which makes sense since I only received one jar of those as well.  I'll take the blame for that one...<br /><br />Anyway, hope this helps someone avoid the same mistake(s)!

review/summary: pretty good and not too "sweet"
review/text: I've found Zevia sodas to be hit-or-miss when it comes to flavors. I also think that a lot depends on individual taste. My wife, for example, loves the cola flavor but I can't stand it. My favorite flavor is Dr. Zevia which to me has no aftertaste at all.<br /><br />I recently noticed new flavors available on amazon and I could not find them in my local stores. I ordered the strawberry flavor hoping it would not be terrible since I was buying an entire case.<br /><br />The strawberry flavoring is pretty good and without knowing it was strawberry you might almost think it is watermelon. There is a slight aftertaste (at least to me) but nothing bad and a lot better than other diet sodas. The soda is clear and has plenty of carbonation.<br /><br />Overall, I like this flavor and would order it again, especially if amazon adds it to the subscribe and save inventory.

review/text: So far I have tried the cola, grape, and now the strawberry.<br /><br />Stevia is a type of sweetener that does take some getting used to.  (It is really really sweet tasting and some flavers of Zevia I think they get too much stevia in them...)<br /><br />That being said, the strawberry is really not that bad.  It does have a good amount of strawberry taste but not too much.  It kind of reminds me of strawberry bubble gum....  However, I will say that this is one flaver that is very sweet tasting but not really in a bad way.....(if that makes sense?)  (This is one soda that does taste better the colder it is.)

review/summary: Great quality
review/text: I use a lot of seeds for making breads, salad dressings, and in other cooking.  These are excellent sesame seeds.  The only drawback is that it takes a while to use up two packages and unless you are careful to keep the seeds cool and out of the sun they lose a little quality after a few months.  Toast them to bring out the flavor.  Grind them up when making salad dressings and add them to your other ingredients to add new flavor to your dressings.  I toss a handful into salads, onto cooked vegetable or add them to marinades for poultry and meats.  Sesame is very versatile and healthy eating!

review/text: These sesame seeds are great. I used them to make my own tahini and it was very tasty. I don't think I really saved money over buying REGULAR tahini in the store, but I definitely saved over raw, organic tahini and feel more confident that what I'm eating is actually raw. The seeds were also good in crackers. I guess I will probably freeze the second bag until it's time to make tahini again. I've purchased a number of Frontier's items in these large packages from Amazon and I've been happy with all of them.

review/text: I'm a HUGE fan of Seedlander<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KLSZGW">Doctor Kracker Seedlander Organic Crispbreads, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. I go through a shipment of those every month. I wanted to try something else, and listened to the reviews. First of all, I'm not exactly sure what rosemary tastes like, but I have tried rosemary flatbread before and loved it. This cracker either has too much rosemary, or maybe something else I'm not aware of. Just my opinion on the taste. I really am going to give the unopened boxes to charity (a person who is hungry). I will keep these in my car because I know somebody less fortunate than me will really appreciate these. Hopefully, they like it as well as the other reviewers. Peace

review/summary: I Ordered Another Shipment After I Tasted These!!
review/text: These are the best crackers I've ever tasted!  They also are a tasty snack for those of us who are counting our calories.  A serving of 19 is only 130 calories.  These are called "Crispbread," so rather than crackers, they are more like thin, crispy wafers with a hint of rosemary. They're very satisfying on their own, but if you add cheese or another topping, they are divine!  They're also made right here in Colorado!

review/text: These were my favorite biscuits when we lived in London.  Now I've learnt to call them cookies,  but their delicious oaty goodness with a thick chocolatey cover... just works so well. We also dip them in tea,  to make them melt a little and then it's amazing how quickly the pack is gone!<br /><br />I have seen these around for cheaper,  so this is not the best price you could get for them, but they are hard to find,  so if you can't get any locally,  these are still worth it.

review/text: I needed some hobnobs as a surprise for my wife.  These were just what she wanted.  My only regret was that I didn't pay a lot more to get them from somewhere else.  They chocolate was melted and it took a lot of work to pry them apart.  If it's summer, wait until winter to order these from Amazon.  They weren't destroyed and were good as new once pried apart, so I gave five stars.  I can't fault the product because I chose to ship chocolate.  I personally prefer the ones without chocolate, but my wife and everyone else we asked likes them with chocolate.
