review/summary: Perhaps too compostable?
review/text: I bought these bags to go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017WOFSI">Exaco Trading ECO-2000 2.4 Gallon Kitchen Compost Waste Collector</a> that I purchased on Amazon. The bags fit perfectly, but they seem to start degrading within a few days. If I took out compost every day, it would be fine, but I empty my compost bucket about twice a week. When I lift a bag to take it outside, it is dripping, so I have to take the whole bucket out and scrub it thoroughly afterwards to get rid of the odor. Previously, when I used a regular plastic shopping bag, leakage was almost never a problem, but it is a regular occurance with these liners. I like that the bags are biodegradable, but rather than purchasing these again, I'll probably go back to re-using plastic bags when my supply runs out--unless I find a sturdier brand. Any suggestions?

review/summary: Works great for my needs
review/text: I use this to line the compost collection can I keep under the sink or I use one when I am doing a big cooking project to gather compostable items.  If I let things set in the bag more than 5 days the bags start to leak as they start to break down.  And breaking down is what I want them to do as I put them into my compost bin.  Even in winter I notice that they start breaking down rather quickly.  I am sure by spring when I am ready to use my compost these bags will be fully intergrated into my compost.

review/summary: Takes Getting Used To!
review/text: Its not that these bags are bad - its really more that it takes some time to get used to a compostable bag!!  they aren't as 'strong' as the regular bags you're probably used to (and that goes for me too) so it has taken me some time to get used to the fact these bags don't stand up very long to let's say compost material - but I will say that if you are diligent about getting your composte down to the bin more frequently it is nice to be able to just throw bag and all into the bin!

review/summary: I have the opposite problem of most other reviewers...
review/text: in that my bags don't break down at all.  I put them in my compost pile each week but over time (approaching 9 months since I put the first bag in) I've ended up with a compost pile consisting of about 40 intact bags - like having 40 separate compost piles.  I actually had to take the waste out of each bag and mix everything then throw out the bags themselves in the garbage.  I'll just get normal small trash bags at this point and empty the waste out of those each week.  That's what I've ended up doing with the "compostable" bags but at a lot higher price.<br />I wished they worked ...

review/summary: These bags are NOT compostable!
review/text: I have recently started composting and have searched for several months for compostable bags that are sturdy enough to last until the bag is full. I have tried a few different brands, and so far been disappointed with bags that begin to break down as soon a bit of food scraps are thrown in, which makes for a yucky clean up at the end of a day or two when the bag is full and ready to go in my compost bin. I thought I had finally found a bag that was exactly what I had been looking for when I received these EcoSafe "Compostable Bags". They were sturdy and well made, and at the end of a couple days in my kitchen compost pail, they had not broken down at all! They were perfect. But, like my mother always said, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. The reason these bags didn't break down in my compost pail is because they are not compostable at all! They don't break down in the compost bin either. I wondered what was going on, so I did a little research and discovered that these bags have no business going into a compost bin. They are made out of plastic and not "green" at all.  They "bio-degrade" into tiny pellets of plastic.  Personally, I do not like toxic plastic in my compost, being absorbed by my fruit and vegetable plants, so needless to say I am once again disappointed and feel that these bags are being falsely advertised as compost bags.

review/summary: Should have tried one first
review/text: I bought these through another site. The picture of the bag composting was very convincing, but now that I've used them I can say that they don't compost per statement.  I have used these bags to collect food scraps to take over to my compost bin.  Over a year later they are still there.  I had my husband cut an opening of our compost bin thinking I could get some finished compost out on the very bottom. The plastic tears easier now but still in one piece, was thinking it wouldn't be identifiable.<br /><br />UPDATE I found info regarding "compostable" at plasticsindustry.org and here's a paragraph of what "compostable" means: "In order to breakdown, compostable bags must be sent to an industrial composting facility, not backyard piles or municipal composting centers. There are very few of these facilities in the U.S. and where these facilities are not available, compostable bags will sit in landfills because they<br />can't be recycled."  Shocking or what?!

review/summary: They are as advertised, but....
review/text: These compostable bags are definitely that. They will break down, and so are pretty perfect for your typical compostable kitchen waste. However, they are super thin and will break down in your composting bin as well. Maybe not every time, but we have seen about 25% of them begin to break down and leak long before we actually fill it our bin. I would say the average time before the bag begins to leek is around a week. Like I say, not all these bags are apparently created equal, as some do maintain their integrity longer, but it isnt something I would rely on. You are better served changin it out at least once a week, and maybe more often. Dont wait just because you havent prepped as many veggies and fruit this week.

I chose Italian foods cookies and a nostalgic collection of candies from the 40s for my mother. She really enjoyed the gifts that arrived in time for the holiday. Best of all, I didn't have to haul everything down to the already overworked postal workers and keep my fingers crossed for weeks that everything would arrive in good condition.<br />  Amazon and their associates have always given me good value and quick neat shipping. The customer service that the associates have given me is the type of service that even the pickiest person cold find no fault with. I am very pleased with my Amazon shopping experience.Amazon shopping gave me a way to get a gift to my mother in The United States while I sat at my computer in Brazil.<br /><br />  I also sell my books MAN'S BEST FRIEND and RED SKY IN THER MORNING: The Post KATRINA Cover-up, through Amazon and for reading on Amazon Kindle.<br />Mark James Chappell

review/summary: For people who like almond snacks
review/text: This product could best be described as pieces of almond brittle.  It is a Vegan snack comprised mainly of almonds, evaporated cane juice, and a little salt.  The main problem is that they list a "serving" as 7 pieces rather than one package.  Anyone opening a package will probably eat the entire package.  The 7 piece serving has 176 calories with 14 grams of vegetable fat (from the almonds), 4 grams of sugar (from the glaze), 4 grams of protein, and 2 grams of fiber.<br /><br />For comparison, one ounce of lightly salted almonds is listed as having 16 grams fat, 6 grams protein, and 3 grams fiber.<br /><br />The product is an attractive snack for any purpose.  It can be dropped into your travel bag, backpack, desk drawer, etc.  The product is reasonably durable (not overly sensitive to temperature) and is in easy to tear open foil packs.

review/summary: well, that didn't work!
review/text: I was looking forward to providing these treats to our two small dogs but made the mistake of buying six boxes because I thought my dogs would 'for sure' like them based on the reviews. They ate them for a few days, then I started discovering them around the garden. Unfortunately, they didn't like them. Others have written about how good they smell, that they crumble easily etc - I don't think they're any different than any other dog biscuit. They're large, but they break into pieces just fine (without crumbling). I'd suggest you buy a single box to see if your dog actually likes them.

review/summary: These are great dog snacks!
review/text: My border collie will no longer eat a snack unless it is one of the Blue Dog Bakery snacks.  Offered a regular snack, he sniffs and walks away.  This is a very smart dog and he knows what he likes.<br /><br />Honestly, once you open the package, you will understand.  It smells good.  Have you ever opened a dog snack and thought it smelled like freshly baked cookies?  These do.  I never, ever, imagined that dog snacks could smell so good.<br /><br />Lucky they don't make cat snacks.<br /><br />The only flaw with this product is that they do go stale.  I ordered a lot of a bunch of flavors on a Friday sale, I think, and the last box of six smelled a little stale to me.  The dog did not mind at all!

review/summary: Like master, like dog
review/text: Cats aren't truly domesticated. They are wild animals who attached themselves to humans for comfort reasons. Deep inside, a cat is still a little tiger or cougar, ready to lash out at kids, neighbours or some poor sparrows.<br /><br />Dogs, on the other hand, now that's a domesticated animal, alright. Lazy, silly, funny and co-dependent. That's a dog for you. In fact, I'm surprised dogs even bother chasing cats. I mean, what's the story? If you give Fido this dog candy, I'm sure he'll forget about El Tigre in no time!<br /><br />But hey, don't open ten cans of dog food while you're away on holiday, the silly doggie will eat all of them at once, get the stomache ache of the century, and then probably die of malnutrition. They can't take care of themselves. Co-dependency, that's the word.<br /><br />Small wonder dogs have attached themselves to a certain primate known as "modern man". The similarity is striking. Like master, like dog.

review/text: The dogs love these, the only thing I would caution is that they are on the large size.  So though they would be a great snack for large active dogs, they are a bit too much for a puppy and a slightly overweight scottie dog. Some of the shapes are so large they make a meal for a smaller dog.  And they are not they easiest things to break apart. But as stated above the dogs love them, in fact they smell so good they could tempt a human.

review/summary: Blue Dog Bakery Cookies Get Four Paws Rating
review/text: My Yellow Lab prefers these cookies over several other well known brands.  Yes, they are hard as several reviewers have noted - all the better for helping to reduce tarter thru chewing hard cookies or biscuits which in turn helps to promote healthier gums.  I find the hardness of these cookies no different from say Milk Bone Dog Biscuits which my Lab also loves.  I spoke to my Vet about these dry, hard cookies and, based upon the ingredients listed on the cookie box, he saw nothing wrong with giving them as a treat BUT as with any other treat, only in moderation.  He also surmised that the hardness of the cookies could help in reducing tarter buildup.  I give my Lab either one of the larger sized or two of the smaller sized cookies per day.  They make a nice treat after his evening walk.  (He gets a Milk Bone after his morning stroll).  I've purchased both the peanut butter & molasses as well as these assorted flavors cookies and my Lab loves them all.  He gives these Blue Dog Bakery cookies a "Four Paws" rating.

review/text: Sadie is a six year old German Shephard and comes to me asking for dog biscuits whenever she wants one.  I ask her if she wants to go outside and she just looks at me.  I ask her if she wants a dog biscuit and she sticks her tongue out.  That means "yes."<br /><br />Sadie really likes the Blue Dog biscuit more than any others.  I can tell because she asks for one three times a day.<br /><br />Right now it's very hot here in Medford, Oregon, and sadie only wants to go out to "do her duty."  I worry that she is getting too fat.  What a spoiled brat!

review/text: I've purchased Blue Dog Bakery treats before in the store and was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful they smelled.  I even tried a small piece myself - not bad, not bad at all!  Are you sure these are for dogs?<br /><br />I bought the Assorted Flavors here on Amazon because of the terrific value.  I am currently "dog aunt" to a couple of mutts and I take great pride in spoiling them rotten.  They love these treats.  I love that the treats are hard and crunchy, good for their teeth, and that they are made right here in America from all natural human, food ingredients.  As I said before, they smell great and you could probably chow down on these yourself - but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have strong teeth!  Will definitely buy these again for my buddies.

review/summary: Doggone Delicious Dog Treats!!!
review/text: Well, I can't really say that first hand...but my GSD/Husky, Jake, seems to adore them!  He's proven himself a fairly picky eater when it comes to dog treats. Even the 5-star rated goodies have received an upturned nose from this pooch.  The Blue Dog Bakery treats are definitely an exception. They are sizeable morsels, but can be easily broken down when used for training.  They come in assorted flavors and all of them seem to strike a chord with Jake.  You can practically see the smile on his face, the swagger in his step, and the sway of his tail when he knows he's getting one of these morsels from Heaven. OK, I may be overstating it, but these are truly some dynamic dog treats that Jack and I would highly recommend to most the finnicky canine!

Yes, but he doesn't seem to get more.<br /><br />When I first got him, I was giving him Milkbones, which he loved. When I first gave him one of these, at first he didn't know what to do with it, but that quickly changed.<br /><br />He now licks the treat like Popsicles before actually eating it. I'm assuming that means he likes them more.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: My sweet baby dog is a newly diagnosed diabetic and has to have a no sugar added, low fat diet. He was devastated to not have his regular dog treats, bones, etc that he looks for forward to. I've made a hundred trips to a hundred stores, tried dozens upon dozens of different low-fat all natural snacks for him, but he rejected them all, stomped off and pouted. Money wasted...Until I happened upon the Blue Dog Bakery. Wow. It's everything he needs for his diet and he inhales them and begs and pleads for more!!! They even smell amazing. Each box has several different flavors and he never gets bored of them. Such a simple thing that has brought him such enjoyment in his little world. I'm happy. He's happy. So VERY thankful for this product!!!!! Just wanted to pass along this info to anyone else in the same situation.

The first order they lost and couldn't/wouldn't find until Amazon called them.  Then they miraculously found them and said that they would deliver within a week.  That was two weeks into a guaranted 2-day delivery.  I reordered and got the new order in before the scheduled delivery date.  Well, the scheduled delivery date came and went with no dog treats and no call from the USPS.  Amazon did reimburse me for the first order though.  In summary...treats good...USPS...sucks!  Is there any alternative shipping methods available?

review/text: I'm not going to pretend my dogs are particular about their treats because they aren't but they really do seem to enjoy these and I love giving the treats to them.  Why?  They're low in fat, all natural and they smell delicious.  My Aunt was house sitting one weekend and even left us a note just to mention how great she thought they smelled, she calls them "the gingerbread cookies".  They're a nice size for our two larger dogs (75lbs and 60lbs) and I love that they come in a 6 pack so we always have them on hand.

review/summary: Scrumptious!
review/text: This is my 9th year of purchasing Blue Dog Bakery products and I am still very happy with their line of snacks. My two shelties just love them and I have used the  Super Stars not only as rewards for training but also for their night time cookie before bed. I always have my shirt pocket full for the neighborhood dogs when we go on walks, now I am the Pied Piper of dogs!<br />These products are always fresh and consistent in size color and taste, yes I said taste! I read years ago that people take these snacks with them hiking and share them with their dogs. There are human consumption quality. So I tried it, ok maybe I would prefer an Oreo, but they are not that bad at all. So now I test them on occasion to see if they are consistent, and they are. The Natural soft peanut butter chews, they look like Fig Newtons, stay fresh from the time I open the package till they are all gone. Now you never want to overdo it with snack because it is the fastest way to cause obesity in your pet. So I actually count out their cookies for the day and put them in a little tin to keep me for over doing it. This has helped me to control their weight and to help me remember how many I have given them.

review/summary: Great Product - But check Price!
review/text: My dog loves these!  They are crunchy, tasty (my pups input), big pieces (so you may want to break in half) and low fat (human concern).<br /><br />Amazon is always a great shipper/supplier BUT the price here is not competitive.  Just bought these at the store and the regular price is $3.99/box, store had them on sale for $2.99 and I had a coupon for $1 so I got it for $1.99/box.

review/summary: Great treats,  even better price!
review/text: I have purchased the Blue Dog treats for my two Huskies, who absolutely LOVE them.  While any treat is excitedly accepted, they are especially happy when I give them these particular cookies.  Not that I can blame them; they smell good enough for humans!  I also really like the fact that they are made in the US.  My dogs do not get any stomach upset with Blue Dog, something I can no longer claim about Milk Bones.  The monthly shipment, or in my case,6 week shipment, ensures that I won't run out, and the price buying in bulk makes these treats very affordable.<br /><br />Thanks Blue Dog, we love your company!

review/summary: A MUST HAVE DOG TREAT
review/text: These are simply the greatest. NATURAL and low fat. Baked dog treats. My Chihuahua's and my German Shepherd LOVE them. They are easy enough to break into pieces for my chihuahua's and large enough to give to my German Shepherd without breaking up. I plan on keeping these around on a permanent basis and give them to my fellow dog lovers as Christmas gifts.  A Must have item you simply can't go wrong with. Thanks Blue Dog Bakery.

review/summary: Doggy Treat JACKPOT
review/text: I have two boxers - a 60lb highly food motivated male who literally drools when I reach for these "cookies" and a 45lb finicky princess who thoroughly inspects anything offered to her before eating it (or not).  These Blue Dog Bakery Treats are hands down, the best dog biscuits I have found... And both of my dogs LOVE them.<br /><br />Even though both dogs are on grain free diets, I make Blue Dog treats the one exception because of the clean, all natural ingredients.  Each box contains a variety of flavors and a few sizes -- I have been searching for larger sized dog treats, and these are perfect.  As a bonus (for me) these treats don't smell like dog food - they actually smell pretty good.<br /><br />I put these on auto delivery so I always have them on hand... And I break them into smaller pieces for use when training (my male is a recent rescue).<br /><br />I will point out that there was a quality control problem with the last batch I ordered.  Instead of their usual rich colors and crisply defined shapes, three of the boxes I've recently opened contained paste-y blobs formed into biscuits.  They smelled the same and my dogs didn't seem to notice a difference, so I kept them.  So, they still earn 5 stars in my book -  but that will change if this problem persists.  If quality control is lacking - that could be an indicator of more significant issues.  For now I still highly recommend.

review/summary: My dogs like these healthy treats!
review/text: All my dogs like the Blue Dog Bakery treats. They have other treats which smells stronger, but judging from the ingredients the Blue Dog Bakery is one of the healthier treats for them. There are also other natural treats on the market which also have great quality ingredients, but whenever we have doggie party, the dogs would refuse other healthy brands and go for the Blue Dog. I also purchased other Blue Dog treats which are low fat, other flavors, and they're equally popular.<br /><br />These little treats are also great for training because they're bit size, so the dogs don't have to spend a lot of time slowing down chewing them. They're not too small neither which prevents them from being swallowed in haste.<br /><br />One thing to note is that these may not be wheat free. Whenever I adopt a new dog with unknown history, I try to give the new dog wheat and grain free product in case they have allergy, and slowly ease them into food that contains wheat and grains. Luckily none of my adopted dogs turned out to be allergic, so they all get to enjoy all those tasty treats all the time!

The shapes are adorable and the sizes that come in the boxes vary, so I don't have to break big ones in half for smaller dogs! I work in a grooming salon and use these treats in my treat bags. The figures make great center pieces for my bags, and I haven't had any complaints about the taste yet! I've never had a problem with upset stomachs with these treats, which is a BIG problem for my smaller dogs :)

I have 3 dogs (2 golden retrievers, 1 cocker spaniel) and they love these treats.  Purchase on the Subscribe and Save program ... it's great!

review/text: Blue Dog Bakery came recommended from one of my dog newsletters that I think highly of.  I had not heard of Blue Dog Bakery until then.  By buying 6 boxes at a time, the price per box is more reasonable than the Mother Hubbard Large Biscuit 4lb. bag I was using.  My dog has certainly been happy with these biscuits and because it is low fat it is a good choice.  It is important to not let our dogs put on extra weight for a variety of reasons.

review/summary: Blue Dog - A great dog biscuit
review/text: This is the only dog biscuit that my large dog absolutely loves.  They're all natural and low fat, which is great, but he obviously loves them for the taste as he eagerly takes them when offered.  This is in contrast to the large, name brand plain biscuits which must smell like sawdust to him as he takes them reluctantly or just walks away.  Each Blue Dog box contains a variety of animal shapes and sizes and I prefer the ones that have four flavors in each box.  They're also available through Amazon at a much better price than PetSmart which inexplicably stopped carrying such a quality product.  My dog and I would highly recommend Blue Dog biscuits.

We've shared these treats with a 2-year-old Golden Doodle who has the same reaction: the cookies (and yes, that's just what they seem like) are gobbled up in micro-seconds.  When I look at the ingredients list, I'm tempted to try the treats myself -- they look healthier than a lot of the people-treats on the shelves in the supermarket.  Can't recommend these highly enough.

When they hear the box being opened (which I do very quietly) they come from wherever they are and sit very nicely with an expectant look on their faces.  I feel good knowing that these treats are healthy and low fat. Some of these treats are fairly large and would have to be broken up for a small dog. The 6 pack is a good buy and when I open the last box, I know that it is time to reorder.
