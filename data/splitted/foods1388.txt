review/summary: Hodgson Mill Bread Mix Is Great Stuff!
review/text: Hodgson Mill makes a fantastic array of bread mixes<br />that are easy and fun to make.  I buy the European<br />Cheese & Herb to make the most heavenly pizza crusts<br />with.  I usually use 2 mixes and make a gigantic pizza<br />with very thick crust filled with every kind of topping<br />you can imagine.  Everytime I share this pizza with<br />others, they *ALWAYS* comment on how wonderful the<br />crust is, and say they are dying to know what my secret<br />recipe is.  No commercial pizza company can beat the<br />taste, no matter how expensive or gourmet it is.  If<br />you want to make a truly "knock-your-socks-off GREAT<br />pizza" you simply MUST try Hodgson Mill European Cheese<br />& Herb bread mix for your crust!  I'm getting hungry<br />just writing about it, so I'm gonna go now and make me<br />a yummy pizza!

I have a wonderful bread machine and all of the Hodgson Mill bread mixes come out perfect!  Every time!  This one is our favorite! Texture and taste could not be better!  Makes the house smell wonderful when baking!  Sliced thin this is amazing for sandwiches or toast.  Keeps for a week in the frig, but we usually eat it faster than that!  Highly recommend!!!

review/summary: almost perfect - not whole grain
review/text: Whenever I make a loaf of this my family eats it as some would eat popcorn, taking a slice every time they walk anywhere near the kitchen.  It does slice nicely, and would probably make great sandwiches if it would last that long.  I make it at high altitude in a 2 lb Cuisinart breadmaker, so under perhaps less than ideal conditions.  It's very easy to make, and with the Subscription, it's affordable, too.

review/summary: Golden, High, and Fluffy
review/text: This bread worked out great in my machine. I made a few loaves on delay, and one right away. Each came out exactly the same: perfect.<br /><br />Flavor: it tasted great to us. I serve it when my extended family is around. Everyone liked it, plus it gets the "freshness" bonus points. The cheese and herb are light in this brand, so if you like a very strong herb flavor, this might not be for you.<br /><br />Price: With Amazon Prime, I'm paying $2 a loaf. I see that some people don't like the price, but is making home-baked bread a money decision? Not for me - I do it for the ceremony, for the great odor in the house, and the luxury of a fresh loaf of bread.

review/text: I have purchased this product many times.  Makes a great tasting BLT.  The only problem I've encountered is the yeast package sometimes is old and the bread does not rise.  Happens a lot when I purchase several cases of the product.  This can be fixed by purchasing fresh packages of yeast and using it instead.

review/summary: Best Bread for Grilled Cheese Sandwiches!
review/text: We make this great, tasty bread two or three times a week. It's great for sandwiches -- especially grilled cheese. We also make braided loaves baked free-form to serve as "pull apart" bread to serve with soup and salad. However, a tip if you don't use a bread machine. We add a tablespoon of honey and a teaspoon of sugar to the water to proof the yeast then add a teaspoon of regular, not fast-rise, yeast to that provided with the mix. This seems to work better using a KitchenAid to mix and kneed the bread. Bake as directed. The extra east seems to withstand the longer rising time required when using an oven to bake the loaf.

review/summary: My favorite Hodgson Mill bread by far!
review/text: I bought this bread to use with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005QFL0">Panasonic SD-YD250  Automatic Bread Maker</a>.  The directions were simple (and with that particular bread maker, the water temperature is inconsequential) and within 2 minutes my work was done.<br /><br />The bread smelled delicious as soon as the mixing began and got even better during baking.  The loaf rose very high and the herb flavor was great (not overpowering).<br /><br />In addition to traditional loaf bread, this makes great rolls, pizza crust, and calzones.<br /><br />The Amazon price is good, too, compared to my local grocery, where these are sold in the "organic" section (with the requisite "organic" price tag) for twice as much.

THE PRODUCT IS PERFECT FOR A NOVICE LIKE ME. I WOULD SUGGEST ANYONE, NOVICE OR NOT, TO TRY THIS MIX OUT.

review/text: This is our favorite of all the Hodgson's mixes.  I like to add poppyseeds to the mix, or dried onion, and extra herbs.  It's a delicious bread with our without additions.  It has a delicate flavor, which is great, because you don't always want an overpowering bread, but if you do you can easily add more ingredients to it.  I've never had a mix fail to rise.  I usually make this in my breadmaker, but I've also made it in to rolls in the oven.  This also makes a great focaccia base.  One of our favorite ways to augment this mix is to add tomato powder and garlic powder- and it smells like an Italian meal is cooking in our breadmaker.

review/text: I have bought several types of bread mix for my breadmaker.  My family likes this type of bread mix "head & shoulders" above all others.  I like each different type, but this one is the best.  Hodgson Mills deliver exceptional quality.  Never had a problem with any box, every one created a great loaf of bread.  And the price from Amazon is GREAT.  Buying one box of this in a grocery store would be 2 time more expensive or even more.  Great product, great company and Amazon, in this case, has the best price!

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I loved this bread.  Very tasty with a good texture and taste.  I tried making something similar from scratch and it didn't turn out anything like this bread.  Slices great warm or cold.  I bake for my boss and her family and they all voted a resounding "Yes, we like this" when I brought her in a loaf.  Freezes well and toasts up great either plain or with butter or cream cheese.  My boss ate hers with spaghetti after lightly toasting.  She said it was outstanding and wanted more (am I surprised, no).  Would highly recommend if you want a good Italian style bread.  I made mine in my horizonetal Wolfgang Puck breadmaker and used a crisp or dark crust setting.  I tried all other settings, light and medium and the bread came out great with a little different texture but still great nonetheless.

review/text: I had purchased the Caraway Rye as the first bread I tried from Hodgson. Maybe the yeast was bad, but it was terrible, so my friends and I were apprehensive about this pack. This bread is fantastic.<br /><br />In my opinion, take this bread, toast it, butter it, and put garlic salt on it and you will have the only bread you will ever eat with pasta again. It would be easy to find your own favorite use for this bread. I have given some of it to co-workers and friends and I have not yet met someone that did not like this bread. I had to give up a whole loaf to someone who tried it it today!<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in this bread.

Only the best for me and mine:)<br /><br />I love good sandwiches. On the grill or off. This bread adds a dimension to a grilled ham and cheese like you never had. Making a ham and cheese, roast beef and swiss, egg salad, chicken salad tuna salad, turkey club? OMG! Toasted adds yet another dimension to this fabulous bread. and with and Italian meal I sauted E.V.O.O. and lots of garlic and applied it to the slices then broiled. I SLICED THE LOAF INTO WIDER SLICES THEN REGULAR BREAD SLICES. Crispy and yet the bread substantial enough to be chewy. No fluff bread here!  What a CONCEPT!

review/summary: Tasty Well Formed Loaf
review/text: I first bought this mix about a year ago. I am no expert at the art of bread making but I have made approximately one dozen loaves from this mix both by hand and bread machine and each method produced a delicious, well formed and consistently textured loaf. The simple and accurate instructions on the box include hand and machine methods for preparing this bread so even the novice can turn out a nice loaf with this mix. The texture is somewhat dense as you would expect from a European style mix. We love the hearty texture but for those preferring a spongier bread just add a couple tablespoons of gluten. We love it for sandwiches and it makes incredible garlic toast served with Italian dishes and steak dinners. It freezes exceptionally well but we always use ours within two months of freezing. It also makes terrific pizza dough.

review/summary: Not bad, but I personally need to spice it up a bit
review/text: I purchased a Breadman TR875 breadmaker back in December and I'm a newbie to the baking world.  I always found it easier to just buy a loaf, but figured I'd love to try to make my own one day.  When the breadmaker deal came across, I dove into breadmaking.  Bought a few books, tried a few recipes, and really haven't been wowwed.  I had gotten this 6 pk for about half the current price on a Gold Box deal (just over $10).  The first box I made came out absolutely perfect; nice texture, good taste, had risen perfectly, but something was missing.  I jazzed it up with the herbs used in another bread recipe I've had (which was awesome) and became one of the best toasted-with-butter breads I have encountered to date.  I've been playing with the amounts of spices and still haven't found that perfect loaf, yet.  If the price is right, I'd definitely purchase this imparticular "flavor" again.<br /><br />My additional spices (jarred), in case anyone is interested:<br />1 tsp garlic, 1/2 tsp basil, 1/4 tsp tarragon, 1/4 tsp dill weed, 1/8 tsp thyme

review/text: This is one of the BEST bread machine mixes I have ever used! For me, this is one that you dont get to be too "creative" with, just follow the directions, and you WILL get a perfect loaf. The only time I have had a bad result was when I thought it would be a super idea to semi-replicate a from scratch concept with bacon and MORE cheese.<br /><br />As my friend Heather reminded me "baking bread is science".  (ok, when I add stuff I use Hodgson Mill White bread mix. So THERE, Heather!).<br /><br />I like the fact that it truly is goof proof - from the newer machines, to my Mom's trusty West-Bend dual paddle unit ( yup, she has a newer one, but still likes her "vintage" 1994 ((??)) unit, best).<br /><br />Though any bread-machine mix is (honestly) pretty easy, some results are sub-par. Not with THIS mix. I would guess that it maybe takes 5 minutes to prepare, including reading directions. The result is outstanding! This is a great one to give as a gift too- the unique aroma and flavor really seem to please people.<br /><br />NICE!

review/text: I purchased these bread mixes intending to use the finished product with bread dipping herbs and olive oil. My guess was right, this bread went perfectly! I baked it in my bread machine and it turned out beautifully with the setting for a medium crust. All I had to add was a little bit of oil and some water. Fresh bread doesn't get any easier than that!<br />My only complaint is that one of the boxes of mix did not have the yeast packet included as it should have. Other than that, no complaints at all. The price was also very reasonable.

review/summary: Hodgson Mill European Cheese and Herb Bread Mix
review/text: It produces a decent loaf of bread however the flavor is rather mild. Which we found disapointing. We also noticed that the aroma when baking was minimal. Again not a big perk. One of the reasons for baking at home is the scent flooding the home making you eager for dinner! However we found when served with dishes of seasoned olive oil it was wonderful! We may buy it when we find it on sale but otherwise we are not likely to go out of our way to purchase again.

review/summary: Speedy......and great too! New price doubles old price!
review/text: If you haven't checked recently, the cost of these bread mixes have more than doubled!!!! Even with subscription rates prices have doubled. If I didn't look closely at my subscriptions, which include this mix and also the Whole Wheat Honey mix, I wouldn't have noticed it and Amazon would have shipped as normal without informing me of the new price hike, kinda' unscrupulous. I know food prices are skyrocketing all over because of fuel costs, but more than double the original subscription price? The original price of $9.60 was tremendous, but does the extra fuel costs justify the new cost? The same is true for all of the Hodgson products, including their Vital Wheat Gluten. All of their products are great, but is anybody out there making more money now in this economy? I cancelled all my subs because I felt the wool was being pulled over my eyes. Do not let my criticisms hold you back from purchasing these excellent products, but with things looking like they are not going to get any better soon, I am going back to making my breads from scratch. See below for my original review:<br /><br />I purchased a case of Hodgson Mill European Cheese and Herb Bread Mix two days ago!!!! I purchased it as a Gold Box deal just for me, which made it ridiculously inexpensive, $10.73 a case of 6, delivered, which will average out to about $2 a loaf, more expensive than scratch, but  not much more expensive, and I do not know of a recipe that could challenge this one. (If I knew in advance how delicious this mix is, I would have put it on the subscription program, bringing it down even further, to less than $9.60 a case, delivered) It was in my bread machine within 15 minutes of receiving it. Three hours later... my house starts smelling like a pizza parlor back in my home town Brooklyn 50 years ago. And, this stuff tastes like it smells, luscious! I made the mistake of baking it in my machine on dark, which made the crust just a little too dark, just short of burnt, but it was still the most delicious loaf I've produced, scratch or mix. It was liberally laced throughout with the herbs, and it was so moist and tender, you must try some! Do not hesitate, get this mix, it is the ultimate in ease, just add some butter, or oil of your choice, some water, the included yeast, and the mix, according to your machine, in 3-4 hours, your house too, will smell like your local home pizzeria:~)<br />P.S. It makes a 1 1/2 lb loaf, but can easily be adjusted down to a one pounder, there are directions for both.<br />P.P.S. Yeahs to Amazon for getting it to me in two days.<br />P.P.P.S. I have learned early in my bread machine history that you must let the finished loaf sit and cool down to room temperature on a bakers rack. It comes out of the machine piping hot and still cooking through the steam generated, so please, try to resist the urge to slice it up right away...... hey, hey, hey, I saw you... put that knife down! It really makes a huge difference.<br />P.P.P.P.S. I will try to post several photos of my latest loaf shortly, cheers.....<br />P.P.P.P.S. I have since used this mix for pizza dough(instructions on box). It has turned my normally bland pizza into pizzeria style pizza, I was so proud of myself, I can now make pizza that rivals pizzeria style pizza!!!!

review/summary: Rare concentrate from organically grown blueberries.
review/text: Awesome product! Many are skeptical how naturally sweet this concentrate is, but if you take a bite of real blueberry and real cranberry, you'll notice right away how tangy cranberries are and how sweeter and much less tangy the blueberries taste, so comparing this concentrate to cranberry concentrate for the natural sweetness is not feasible. I'm quite this concentrate's sweetness is natural sweetness, as I'm very sensitive to the high fructose corn syrup in the drink. This blueberry concentrate is from organically grown blueberries, so a big higher price compared to others is understandable. I usually add 1/10th of glass and filled with water to drink. No need to add any more sweetness as it is naturally sweet as is. In our rural area, it's hard to come by organically grown blueberries, so this is product is great to compensate my problem!<br /><br />UPDATE on June 29, 2012<br /><br />Almost right after I posted this review, I noticed that the company stop listing "organically grown blueberries". Now it's listed "blueberries", and I assume they are no longer organic. It's too bad since this product was the only one that I know that was made organically. Don't the companies know we consumers want organic products especially when it comes to produce as listed as "dirty dozen" based on how pesticide contaminated!

review/summary: My baby loves these!
review/text: I had heard Mum Mums were a great finger food for babies so as soon as I got the OK from my son's pediatrician to start finger foods/teething biscuits, I purchased these.  I was a little worried about the fact that they were from China, but after doing some research, I found that the milk powder that Mum Mums contain is made in New Zealand and that the Organic Mum Mums do not even have milk powder as an ingredient (although the box does state that the product may contain trace amounts.)<br /><br />Anyway, my son loves to chew on these and play with them, and they don't make a mess like other teething biscuits.  They are easy for him to hold and manipulate.  I definitely recommend these over the other types of finger food and biscuits that you can get.<br /><br />I bought mine from Amazon (for a good price for six boxes) but I have also seen these at Babies R US.

review/summary: Great for calming fussy babies!
review/text: Baby Mum-Mum Organic Rice Rusks are great for calming a fussy baby.  They are slightly sweet and dissolve quickly in the mouth.  You would still watch your baby when they are eating these because they can still choke on these if they try to stuff a big piece in their mouth.  This happened to us only once and our baby just spit it back out with a gag reflex.  I love giving these to our baby while we're having our dinner so he can feel like he's eating with us.  The only problem with these are when they get moist from being in the baby's mouth and it ends up on the baby's clothes or high chair or car seat, they dry like cement to whatever it is sticking to.  I love that they are organic though but I don't like that they are made in China.<br /><br />Pros: calms baby's fussiness, dissolves quickly, baby can practice self-feeding, organic<br />Cons: potential choking hazard, made in China, hardens to fabrics and objects when wet

I always had them on hand because they were a neat snack that always made my kids happy and kept them occupied.  I had huge qualms about the fact that they were made in china, but thought it might help to buy the organic type.<br /><br />I've found a new product recently, coco pop lite rice cakes, that are my new substitute.

They aren't really marketed towards babies and kids, but they really should be.  I will still probably get some mum mums to keep in the diaper bag or car, but I won't be getting them by the case on subscribe and ship like I was before.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PEHCFK">Original Flavor: Coco Multigrain Pop Cakes, 12 Bags, 16 Calories Per Piece, 0 Weight Watcher Point, Great Diet Food, Free Shipping, Only $35.99</a>

review/summary: Nom Nom Mum Mums!!!!
review/text: My daughter LOVES these and from the rate they are disappearing I am starting to think my husband does as well. The first time we got them we ran across the banana variety at a local grocery (at around 4 bucks a box!). But as soon as we got them home and baby started freaking out with joy every time she was given one, I ordered the box of the organic. I ordered the organic mostly because of the a) "China" thing, and b) the banana ones seemed like they might have more sugar. We just received our 2nd case yesterday and this time we went with the veggie flavor. These I may end up eating if baby doesn't hurry, they're delicious! I really am not that concerned about the Made In China aspect at this point...I understand the concerns of the mothers who are, but since it is a product exported that is also used there on their own children...and the ingredient list is pretty straightforward...it seems a bit xenophobic to worry too much.<br />Now I'm just waiting for her to get enough teeth so we can try the strawberry toddler ones. :)

Sure enough, as soon as my son was old enough to eat solids, we found out the awesomeness of the Mum-Mum.  My son loves these things.  It's easy to throw a pack of them in a bag for road trips or for daycare.  The USDA certifies the Mum-Mum as organic, which is super-duper!  I'd rather they weren't made in China because I'm tired of us giving China all of our money, but oh well, if an American company can make a snack as cool as the Mum-Mum, I'd happily switch over! For right now, our family is sold on the product.

review/text: These are great items because they encourage the learning to eat solids phase safely.  The crackers dissolve in their mouth very quickly, yet they can practice the chewing skill.  They love putting things in their mouth so it keeps them entertained.  My 15 mo old still likes them.  :)

review/summary: Better than a Pacifier
review/text: My baby loves these! She has been eating them since she was 6 months old. The veggie flavored ones and the organic ones are great. She doesn't care too much for the banana ones. I am a little concerned regarding the "Made In China" tag, but see other reviewers who have stated they are backed by an independent company as well. (There are multiple of reviews that have mentioned this statement).<br /><br />This product has saved me from many headaches and meltdowns as once she has it in her hands, she is quiet and content. happy baby, happy mommy. they melt in her mouth, she can hold them, they aren't hard like many other teething biscuits that crumble when you bite into them. Yes, if you put it in your purse, and place your wallet on top of it, it will crumble. Otherwise, it holds up well.<br /><br />definitely try a box. BTW, my older son loves these as well.

review/summary: Terrible sticky mess - but the baby loves them
review/text: These things dissolve when in contact with saliva or water into some kind of rice-glue-paste which apparently tastes great to the baby. It's either that or she just loves to manipulate it and feed herself. It's probably some combination.<br /><br />I was concered that these were made in China, given the lack of trust I have for foodstuffs made there (PRC has terrible food safety standards:[Link to Food_safety_incidents_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China removed]). However I did verify that Bigwant Foods is listed in the USDA's National Organic Program certified operations database ([Ref # 41799 in the NOC database link removed]). This makes me more trusting as there is some independent verification.

review/text: Mum-mums are one of my favorite finds for baby. We have given them to our three children as early as 6 months.<br />We LOVE them!!! They disolve almost instantly, so there's not much worry of choking; they have a nice crisp so they feel good on teething gums; they are not very messy like most teething crackers; the ingredient list is simple - not loaded with sugar or preservatives; and most importantly they love them!<br />They are also conveniently wrapped in two packs, so they are great to throw in your purse or diaper bag.<br />My 3 and 5 year olds still ask for them when I have them out for my 11 month old.<br />Also love that they come in organic as well as a vegetable flavor now.<br />I buy them buy the case!!!

review/summary: My 7 month old baby loves these-texture+++
review/text: My baby does NOT like purees.  She wants table food, and lots of it-give her a grain of rice or half a pea, and she is your friend for life, but if you give her a bite of mushed banana or baby food from the jar and she makes a horrified face and spits it out.  That being said, she LOVES these!  She has two bottom teeth, and the only down side to these great biscuits is that she can easily chomp off a mouthful, but they dissolve so easily they immediately begin disintegrating in her mouth.  What I am doing is breaking them for her into bite size pieces.  I don't understand all the cheerio comparisons, because a baby that can chew and eat cheerios well doesn't need 'teething' biscuits, they are beyond that stage.  These biscuits are a great transitional food to get to a point where a baby can eat cheerios, not to be used in place of them.  The little pieces disintegrate almost immediately in the mouth, unlike a cheerio.  They also stick to the slightest bit of dampness, making them easy to grab for a little one who is still working on fine motor skills.  My only disappointment is that they are made in China, and they do have a lot of packaging, which is convenient but not very eco-friendly, to say the slightest.

review/text: I bought Mum-Mums for my son when I saw my nephew eat them like popcorn. Usually companies who make organic foods have an interest in being eco-friendly. This product is the total opposite. Box, inner plastic bag, foil wrapper around each and every mum-mum. No thanks, I'll use cheerios in a reusable container. It's an easy choice since my son does not like them. He always hands them back to me after the first bite.

review/text: Our 1 year old is a huge fan of these.  She's loved them since she was about 8 months.  I had no worries about giving them to her at such a young age.  They melt really quickly in her mouth so there's no fear of choking.  They're not sweet, no salt so there's no worry about spoiling her palate.  They're great for her to just hold onto and munch on.  She loves them at home, in her car seat, at restaurants.  They're fantastic when I need her to focus on something for like 5 minutes.  Definitely my go-to snack for her.

review/summary: A disappointment all around
review/text: I bought the mum-mums for two reasons: to provide teething itch relief for my 6-month-old son and to keep him independently occupied with something to munch on. The mum-mums disappointed on both of these counts. They are way too fragile and crumble easily. I thought they would be hard so that he could suck on them for a while, but as soon as I put one in his mouth he "bit" off a huge piece that obviously would have presented a choking hazard. And he can't even hold them - they crumble in his grasp. (This is also the reason they are not so good on the go - they crumble to pieces in the bag.) So, I end up breaking off little pieces and putting them in his mouth. I could use Cheerios for that instead of spending that much money on the mum-mums!<br />Taste-wise they are pretty good and he enjoys them, plus they are organic and I know they are easy on his stomach. But they are a disappointment because they failed on both intended purposes: they do not provide teething relief and they do no work as a snack for him to enjoy on his own.

While they are very tasty I was disappointed that they're so sugary! The tops are speckled with a strawberry icing making this more like a cookie. Don't want my 9 month old daughter hopped up on sugar, so I'm sticking with the non-organic. I wish they made an organic version with no icing-like top!

review/summary: Hoping to start a less biased discussion
review/text: Immediately after drinking Penta, I definitely felt "refreshed" (whatever that means), the texture seems "smoother" and the water appears clearer, but I believe that these characteristics are merely psychosomatic and fall in line with thinking of what pure water means. I felt calmer overall, but I attribute this to the water, not the oxygen. Otherwise, I think the oxygen takes away from the full benefit of the product.<br /><br />After a few cycles of testing Penta, my instincts kicked in and I started reading about the effects of too much oxygen in the body and brain. Since it stands to reason that if Penta is infusing their bottles with oxygen, their water would end up being impregnated with it. Though the oxygen in their bottles could be minimal, it could be enough to offset the nitrogen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood after drinking enough of it, especially with their patented level of filtration. There's no doubt that Penta water feels like it is being absorbed more readily than others, an effect which seems enhanced when drinking it cold. I have noticed this effect also when I had a bout of altitude sickness in Colorado. At the time, someone recommended I drink plenty of water to feel better as it had oxygen in it. I found some bottled water (from another commercial brand) and drank as much as I could. I could literally feel the water oxygenate my body as I drank it.<br /><br />Logically, then, one might assume that water impregnated with oxygen would be better for you. I believe, though, that the benefits of oxygen in water are only met if the oxygen is within natural levels. Penta claims they add oxygen only to tighten the bottle. I'm sure their marketing team knew that people would come to their own conclusions about this statement and may assume that this was yet be another "purifying" aspect of Penta water. I know of no other drink manufacturer adding oxygen just to tighten their bottle, so I doubt there is a real concern about its use for packing purposes. For some of you who drink several bottles of Penta a day, you may want to consider how much you are over-saturating your blood with oxygen.<br /><br />I started doing some research on Penta with a much more critical eye. That is when I found James Randi. Mr. Randi, as some of you know, is a hyperbolic debunker and skeptic who has offered a one-million-dollar prize to anyone "who can show under proper observing conditions, evidence of any paranormal, supernatural, or occult power or event." After reading the letters (*which can be read publicly online) exchanged between Mr. Randi and the owner of Penta, I got the impression that the owner was just another health trend exploiter, not some arbiter of a new scientific frontier. The guy can't even spell. My thoughts are that this person stumbled upon the next trend of water purification and made a business decision to add a little something extra to merit a higher price point that would reap a greater profit than a competitor's brand. Don't get me wrong. I believe that deionized, low pH, metals -and -trace pharma free water is legit, but claims that Penta water is somehow more special than others using the same methods are truly unmitigated.<br /><br />I think people who are health-conscious these days are toeing the line between reasonable skepticism and hopeful hypochondriacs. I wanted to believe, like many people these days, that I could use an inexpensive regimen of pure supplements to undo any damage I've done to my body. I imagine that people think that when something like water, a necessary ingredient for sustaining human life, is hard to come by in an unadulterated state, it somehow means that ingesting great amounts of pure water must act as some sort of great equalizer in the body, that if you drink clean water, you are aiding your body in being able to reverse and repair damage.<br /><br />I'm sure some of you think my impressions of Penta are crackpot science at best, but consider how it is no different than staring at a few pdfs on the manufacturer's site, understanding none of it, and yet still believing a doctor claiming better benefits who was likely funded by Penta themselves to do the research. This method of boosting the appearance of legitimacy for purified water is common. Look up "Ilumati Lithia water." It appears they had involvement with a clinical trial from the University of British Columbia, a study that has been suspended due to "logistical issues." It's not that as a given I don't believe in the truthfulness of clinical trials. I just won't fall prey to believing that a product is better simply because it was involved in a clinical trial, especially if the product developer has anything to do with it. Think of how you yourself may be buying into quackery just by taking what a business driven for profit says at face value.<br /><br />I urge you to take stock of your own body and share what you've realistically experienced with Penta. I still believe pure water is extremely helpful for the body's regulation. Though this is not a cure-all, based on the competition out there, I believe this could be the best water on the market - if oxygen wasn't placed in the bottle as "added value."

review/summary: Wonderful stuff...
review/text: I love this stuff with just about everything--stir fry, sautes, rice, even popcorn. The flavoring is subtle, but I think that makes it better. It costs less here than on the product website, if you subscribe. Otherwise, it's a toss-up between the lower cost of the product plus the shipping at the site, as the shipping there requires a $100 minimum purchase to get free shipping.

review/text: this is okay oil I had expected a little more from this brand, it was just slightly infused and honestly it didn't smell anything like onion ginger or garlic..it was just kinda peppery i guess but so light it really wasn't worth the money to get 3..if your gonna buy their oils just get the sunflower oil, its much better than this stuff.

review/summary: Have to agree this is not cranberry juice
review/text: Reading the label it says this is "27% cranberry juice" and a bunch of other fairly innocuous stuff, but it is not real cranberry juice.  Yuck. I will not buy it again.

review/summary: Not Cranberry Juice...
review/text: This is a cocktail, meaning it is sugared water mixed with some amount of juice.  The juice may or may not all be cranberry.  And the percentages are not revealed.<br /><br />This is completely false advertising.  This is closer to cool-aid than juice.

review/summary: I love it!
review/text: I am a big cranberry juice fan and this is good juice. I have ordered it multiple times through Amazon. I feel that it is a good value for the price. My only problem is that sometimes when I want it, it is out of stock, so I guess other people must like it too. :)

review/summary: My favorite Starbucks blend!
review/text: I have tried all the Via blends, and my favorite by far is still Starbucks Tribute.  It was so sad when they ran out last year.  My back-up is the Columbian, always good, but I have always loved Sumatra.  The cherry is a note, and does not come across as a 'flavor'.  I do not like flavored coffee.  I heat this in the microwave for two minutes in a mug of 1% organic milk.  Yummy!<br /><br />Starbucks writes:  . . . "Spicy & Cherry" and "With beans from all three of the world's coffee-growing regions . . . Aged Sumatra, sun-dried beans from Ethiopia, and coffees from Papua New Guinea and Colombia come together to create this spicy and full-bodied blend with dark cherry notes."

review/summary: Good product, and good deal.
review/text: I like the VIA Colombia instant coffee. It's medium but still a little dark for me, so I make two cups of coffee with one pack... :)<br />Very good deal from Amazon compare to the price in store.<br />I'll but this product again.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I've learned that I can cutopen the top of the packet, pinch it to divide the micro-ground coffee in half, and it makes a nice cup of coffee! Be sure to know how many ounces your cup is, or, you may be making very strong coffee. Try experimenting a bit to s t r e t c h the individual packet servings. :)

review/summary: IF YOU LIKE REALLY ORDINARY COFFEE...
review/text: My husband and I agree that this brew is really ordinary. If you don't like espresso, or strong coffee, this blend if for you! It reminds me of the coffee I used to drink before finding Lavazza, an Italian coffee we've drunk since 2007 when we came home from France with memories of that divine espresso. Now, we've gotten lazy and enjoy the Starbucks VIA italian roast instant coffee--the key to our appreciation being the strong but NOT BITTER flavor.

review/summary: It's just ok
review/text: This syrup need more flavor-it tasted like regular syrup with some pecan pieces thrown in.  All the pieces of pecan float to the top and fall out on the first serving.
