review/summary: Not a cat's favorite treat
review/text: I'm not really sure what to think of these treats. Cats seems to only want to eat them sometimes. I have given them to three different cats, and each cat has loved them at first and then grown tired of them. I have a feeling that my cats prefer crunchy treats to these moist ones.<br /><br />These treats also have a sour, cheesy smell to them, unlike crunchy treats, which generally just smell like kibbles.

review/summary: Best Lemon Juice
review/text: I bought this at Marty's in Newton, MA... and was looking to buy more now that I live in NC. This is the BEST lemon juice I have ever had. Literally when I first opened it to use I was amazed at how bright and heavenly it smelled. This is NOT your normal lemon juice. I found myself constantly flipping the cap to take another whiff whenever I went to the fridge. My lemon poppy seed cake isn't half as good with the organic lemon juice I bought at Whole Foods last week - in fact hardly anyone would touch it - whereas with Nellie & Joe's Famous Key Lemon Juice it literally disappears. I didn't realize everyone liked it as much as I did till they weren't in the mood for this last cake. Normally its breakfast and afternoon snack for everyone, sometimes even a nibble before bed. This one sat until I finally cut it up and put it in the compost after it started growing mold.

review/summary: Good coffee, superior k-cup design
review/text: This coffee has a good, strong flavor. It doesn't suffer from the weak, watery taste that so many k-cups have, especially the decafs. It might be a little too bitter for some tastes.<br /><br />And it's not the typical plastic k-cup. This is a much better design - there are no more surprise "exploding" k-cups. You can see the filter so you'll know before you brew if the filter is torn, plus you don't get the grinds squirting out the top when the plastic didn't get punctured properly (because there is no plastic cup).  A couple of reviewers have complained that no plastic cup means that the coffee will get stale, but this is no more of a concern than it would be for regular coffee (the kind not in a k-cup, where you open the 1 lb bag or can). You can always put them in a resealable container to keep them fresh - a ziplock bag, or even an old coffee can.

review/text: I was surprise that these had no "bottom". I noticed that they now changed the picture to show this.<br /><br />I switched from the Senseo to K-cups because I didn't like the coffee drip when the Senseo filter were removed and that they need to be stored in a bag to keep them fresh. I assumed that these would have the same problems. I was please that there is no drips with these when removed but I do have to store them in jars to keep them fresh.<br /><br />The taste is incredible! It's the best coffee I've ever had from a single cup brewer. The quality of the coffee and the cheaper price more than makes up for the slight hassle of storing them in jars. The regular coffee is great and the decaf is the best decaf I've ever drank.

The taste/flavor is fine, the residual I mentioned is the only real difference. I would not hesitate to buy them again, nor refer them to friends/fellow Keurig users, with the caveat on the slight residual.

The filter design fits in the k-cup processers well but alot of grind residue is released into the coffee.  You end up with a less than desirable cup of joe.  The idea might work...it just requires a little more improvement and product testing.

The box came in 3 vacuum sealed packages, so I just open one at a time and store in an airtight container...I haven't found that this affects the freshness at all. Once this baby arrives, I'll likely order some other roasts.

review/summary: Nice design, good coffee
review/text: These work fine in K-cup machines, but have less packaging waste than regular K-cups, and cost much less, possibly because of both reduced manufacturing costs and not paying K-cup license fees. A definite win for Keurig users.<br />The San Francisco Decaf makes an tasty medium size cup, one of the best decafs I've had, though like most french roast, it's taste is almost (but not quite) burnt.

review/summary: Great (greener) coffee for k-cups!
review/text: We tried the San Francisco Bay Coffee Decaf OneCup for Keurig in our office because of the price and it was a hit.  The decaf was nice and rich without any metallic or bitter taste.<br />They don't look like regular k-cups but they work great.  Instead of the plastic "cup" it just looks like a coffee filter on the bottom.  That said, it is less plastic and more environmentally friendly.  So, it's a great cup of coffee for less than other k-cups and greener- who can beat that.

review/summary: Great improvement on K-Cups, coffee too harsh, though
review/text: The top of these S. F. Bay coffee cups appear to be K-Cups, cause the foil top looks exactly like every other brand of K-cup for Keurig makers.  The rest of it is extremely unique, different than any other type of K-cup,  There's no plastic below the top ring (where the foil attaches), just filter.  I was really concerned that the puncture tip on the Keurig would penetrate the filter, and there's be coffee grounds everywhere.  Not the case, the SF Bay cup is 1 cm shorter than other K-cups - the filter doesn't reach the puncture tip.  The only issue I had with the coffee is the taste.  It's very strong, and too dark for a French Roast, even set with 10 oz of water.  I've never had "Non-Keurig" S F Bay French Roast, so I can't comment on whether it's similar or not.  IMO it's just stronger than any other type of decaf coffee I've tried in the U.S, also has a burned smell to it.  I really like the cup packaging, a great saver for our environment.

review/summary: San Francisco Bay Coffee "Decaf" One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast
review/text: I've had the Keurig Brewer for a couple of years and the concept is perfect for my coffee drinking needs, however most available decaf coffees for this brewer are very mild and watered down tasting.  I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the San Francisco decaf, it was bold and rich tasting, definitly my favorite prepackaged decaf for the Keurig brewer.  Amazon's Subscribe & Save subscription makes the price of the coffee more reasonable than most other sources.

review/summary: Less waste and great coffee too!
review/text: I'm very impressed with the packaging of these "K-Cups"!  They take up less room when storing (we keep ours in sealed glass jars) and much less room in the garbage can.  Because I compost, and coffee grounds are an excellent addition to the bin, I've been opening up the old style cups and scraping out the grounds.  With these, the lid peels easily off (once slit with scissors) and the grounds just pop out - easy!<br /><br />The taste of the coffee is also excellent.  I prefer deep, dark roasts and the French Roast is perfect.  Can't wait to try other blends and to see other manufacturers tackle this greener packaging style.

review/summary: Excellent flavor flav!
review/text: As the picture depicts these are not your traditional K-cups however like others have stated it is not a problem. They pop right in your machine. To be honest, they might even be better than K-cups because the whole bottom is a filter... I'm not sure, but the coffee is really delicious! I bought these because of the subscribe and save and because they were decaf... so glad I did. Very tasty!!<br />They did come in three separate bags and the filter is exposed. I still have them in the bag they came in and just cut a small whole to grab them out with.  Doesn't bother me. I might store them in a ziplock baggie, but I've only had them for two days and have had two cups therefore don't taste a freshness difference. The bags also have a little coffee filter thingy, like other coffee bean bags have for freshness but without a way to reseal the bag I don't see a point. No big deal for me though. These are a good deal and a great tasting cup of joe! Highly recommend!

It does fit in your Keurig and brews just fine.<br /><br />I love the aroma and the taste of this coffee, reminded my husband and I of espresso we had in Siily, Italy a few years ago.

review/summary: Not a K-cup but works in a Keurig
review/text: As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!

review/summary: San Francisco Decaf OneCp for Keurig K-Cup Brewers
review/text: I ordered this coffee and since it was tagged as for K-Cup brewers, I assumed it would be designed like a regular K-Cup packet, but it is not. It will fit in and work in a Keurig, but because of its design, it lets a small amount of sediment through while brewing, which is not pleasing when you get to the last few sips of coffee. Also, this coffee has a bitter taste, so I definitely will not buy this product again.

review/summary: I thought the reviewers were exaggerating!
review/text: I thought people were so excited to find an alternative to the monopoly that they were going overboard,  but when I opened the seal and got a whiff of the dark,  rich coffee smell I was sold!<br /><br />To add to the current comments:  this product arrives sealed in a large bag.  Once you open it, the seal is broken so it needs to be stored however you store loose coffee.  Also,  this is an extremely dark coffee and pretty strong - much darker and more flavorful than any other k-cup I have tried.  If you prefer a milder coffee, maybe try another of their roasts.<br /><br />I am not an expert in coffee tasting.  I will just say that this is a very rich French Roast,  with the slightly bitter aftertaste that is typical of that style.  I am not sure whether the reviewers who hated it were just not lovers of a dark roast,  or got a bad batch (maybe a broken seal?).<br /><br />This is everything I love about my Keurig (an amazing cup of coffee any time I want one) and none of the things I hate about it (price gouging monopoly,  excessive waste).

review/summary: Great to come home to after a long day
review/text: Up until now my favorite french k-cup was Deidrichs and my favorite decaf was Newman's own. Well move over and make room for San Francisco french decaf. Like fog lifter, the k-cup is unusual. Instead of the bottom holding the coffee being plastic it's a coffee filter, meaning once you open the sealed inner package of k-cups you do need to store them in a baggie or tupperware or something to keep them fresh. I have a b60 and the cup fit perfectly and brew beautifully.<br /><br />Once I get past the weird little cup I appreciate the aroma as I open the baggie. The french decaf is a really nice medium to light bold cup of coffee. The taste is rich and mellow. This is the perfect decaf to curl on the couch after dinner and enjoy a cup of coffee.

review/summary: NOT Dark, Rich, or very tastey
review/text: Well, THIS was a one shot deal! I won't order these again because there are a couple of issues with freshness and flavor that will never allow this coffee to taste as rich and full bodied as say Tully's decaf French Roast.<br />First.. they are not true K cups but instead a little filtered nugged with a foil top. The coffee comes through so much more quickly than in the K cup with a small pierced bottom so I feel there is no time for the water to sit and brew to develop any flavor.<br />Second.. of course it smells great when you cut open the cellophane packaging inside the box but I'm sure that the cost of that burst of aroma will be lost flavor unless repackaged into a locking container or baggie.<br />There is no cost break to make any of these concessions worthwhile, in my eyes. And that taste of the first cup did not wow me at all.. mediocre at best. As often is the case, the aroma was better than the flavor, which was watery and not syrupy or complex or rich at all. All in all, just a disappointment and one time mistake :(<br />Certainly was NOT worthy of the anticipation of being on a waiting list.  Nice name, not so good tasting in the cup though.  Don't be tempted it's not worth it. Better to stay with any of the other, better, bold decafs offered here.

review/text: This is OK Coffee.  Definitely not the worst coffee I have had, but not the best either.  I drink coffee black no sugar so I am picky about my coffee.  I don't go for the celestial male deer brand of coffee which so many coffee brands seem to want to replicate.  If you are looking for a slightly milder/less bitter/better tasting version of that, this might work for you.<br /><br />My wife liked the idea of these style of coffee pods as they appear to use less plastic than a traditional K cup pod.  However, after weighing both this style and a traditional k cup pod (without coffee in it) there is nearly the same weight of plastic.  Not really scientific, but don't let your green side buy these just because you worry about the amount of plastic in a k cup pod.<br /><br />One concert of mine is the coffee going stale in these kinds of packets as they are not sealed to the air.  I only drink decaf on the weekends so it takes me a while to go through a package.  So far they don't taste any different fresh from the sealed package as they do several weeks later.

review/text: I am recently pregnant and have just switched to decaf coffee.  These appealed to me because of the earth-friendly design and mostly positive reviews.  They brewed fine in my Keurig.  Might not be a "standard" k-cup, but they work just as well, with less trash.  Great.  But the taste.  oh my god.  The taste is horrendous.  It's bitter, gritty, strong, but not strong in a good way.  The smell is just as bad.  I drink my coffee black, so it's not like I could even mask the taste with cream and sugar.  I know Amazon doesn't accept returns on grocery items, for health reasons, but I requested a refund anyway and it was granted.  These went straight in the trash, where they belong.  I did try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033HGLTG">Donut House Collection Donut House Decaf, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> and it is delicious!  That will be my go-to decaf for the next few months.

The price obviously was also very enticing.<br />When the coffee arrived, I carefully transferred the pods to a plastic ziploc bag.<br />So far, so good. I then proceeded to brew my first cup - all excited to have found something wonderful.<br />Well, the excitement ceased when the cup produced was pure black liquid with a flavor that was not pleasing to my palate - at all. Maybe if you like bitterness in a coffee without the pleasantness of a well-rounded rich coffee, then this is for you.<br />I found it not an experience to be repeated. I tried to like this coffee, but will go back to another brand. Sorry San Francisco Bay Coffee company - I really tried.<br />The same holds true for decaf French Roast - except it was even less likable...

review/summary: Coffee flavor overwhelmed by bitterness
review/text: My husband and I both like a good strong tasting coffee, but need decaf, so we tried this for our new Keurig brewer. Unfortunately I found that while it was strong, the coffee flavor was overwhelmed by bitterness. We subsequently tried the extra-bold <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6ESS">Green Mountain Coffee Decaf Dark Magic, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> which is more to my liking, with strong flavor, but a flavor of coffee rather than just bitterness.

A big surprise when I opened the box that didn't make me happy.<br /><br />But they do take ya home to a night out camping under the stars and a morning sunrise to a cup of coffee over the fire.  A bit gritty, strong, and full of flavor.

review/summary: Worst coffee ever
review/text: I was trying to find an alternative to donut house decalf, but this is not it. My wife described it tasting like old rotten wood. After taking a sip I had to agree. Will never by again. It could be because of the cheap packaging that does not have a total seal. Reputable coffeemakers package their product in nitrogen to preserve the freshness and you cannot do this without a sealed cup. Advise everyone this product is no good!!!!

review/summary: Nastiest coffee I ever tried
review/text: I had no problem with the unconventional packaging. It brews just as well as the regular k-cups. The problem I had was with the coffee itself. The first thing I noticed was the smell. It does not even smell like coffee, but I am stuck with it so I gave it a shot. The taste is sour and leaves a disgusting aftertaste in your mouth. I ordered it because it was the cheapest coffee I could find that I could use in my Keurig. Now I know why.

review/text: I ordered this as a kcup and got something that may or may not work, but is definitely not an approved kcup. I am not sure what these are for, but am a little nervous about trying to use one in my new Keurig machine. One reviewer said they did try it and it worked.  I have not tried. But if you are expecting the usual plastic K-cup, this is not the product for you. I received 3 plastic pouches in a printed brown cardboard box and nowhere on the box does it mention k-cups. My guess is that these were not licensed for use in Keurig coffee makers.

For anyone who uses the one cup brewers it should bother you a little bit that every time you do you are throwing away a little plastic cup - with the popularity of these models that is a lot of plastic well San Francisco Bay Coffee has eliminated the cup- YEAH!!

review/summary: OK but suffers from lack of K-Cup form factor
review/text: My wife and I used to live in the San Francisco Bay Area and we loved this coffee, the San Francisco Bay Coffee Decaf French Roast blend.  When I spotted this coffee on Amazon for use in the Keurig brewer I immediately ordered it in some quantity based on our past experience.  I was surprised to discover that the coffee is not contained within a K-Cup container but rather it is contained in a coffee filter like material with a top which fits into the K-Cup receptacle of the brewer.  Our family results are mixed.  My wife likes this coffee and drinks it a few times each day.  My experience was that the coffee flavor is still good but the hot water passes through the coffee and filter paper too quickly which produces a watered-down coffee flavor.  I wish the San Francisco Bay Coffee company would get the necessary licenses to put their coffee into actual K-Cup pods.  If the price was competitive, my wife and I would be steady customers.  But for my tastes, I'll stick with the Green Mountain dark roast decaf coffees which have a richer coffee flavor.

review/summary: Not a traditional "cup" for your Keurig
review/text: I took a shot based on the great "subscribe and save" pricing for these.  Haven't tried them in my brewer yet, but a few initial impressions "as received":<br /><br />1. These are not k-cups in the traditional sense.  There's no "cup" to them, just the filter attached to a rim with a seal on it.  So I don't see how these could possibly "brew" in the cup like a k-cup is supposed to brew.  I'm betting these are another "instant" coffee designed to fit a Keurig brewer.<br />2. The shipment of 3 packages of 12 each that I received was 3 clear plastic bags.  No box as shown on the listing picture.  Now I get it they say packing may differ from that depicted, but IMHO it's dishonest of Amazon to display these online with a box when they know they aren't going to ship them that way.<br />3. Combining #1 and #2 together means once you open the plastic bag of 12, since the individual servings aren't sealed per se, in order to keep them fresh it seems to me you would need to put them in some sort of sealed container.  Not at all user friendly for the many "carousel" and "drawer" k-cup storage units offered.<br /><br />I do not plan to open and try them at all.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/10/2012: As you can see from above, I wasn't particularly happy with what I received.  But as I said, those were my "initial impressions" and I believe fairly stated for what they are.  That said, I did contact Amazon customer service about my displeasure, and they issued a full credit to my account.  I've been buying from Amazon since 1998, and this is probably only the 4th or 5th time I've requested a refund on a purchase.  Since this is a grocery item, Amazon said they could not accept a return even IF unopened, and the customer service rep encouraged me to keep the coffee and go ahead and try it.  So, I did.<br />I'm happy to report that it is INDEED real coffee (not instant), the aroma is great and the taste is great.  I've upped my rating from 2 to 4 stars.  I do feel justified in knocking the score 1 star for the inadequate description as people need to understand these are NOT "K-cups", but they ARE real coffee packaged in a manner different than most would expect when buying coffee for their Keurig. And I still contend that displaying what looks like a nice retail box in the item photo is also misleading.<br />My issue #3 of course remains unresolved, and also contributes to the lower of my rating.  You need to keep these stored in a decanter or some other sealed container if you want to keep the other 11 fresh after you open the plastic bag to brew up your first cup.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I ordered these because they're the only decaf K cups I could find for subscribe and save.  You can see from the picture that they're not "traditional" K cups, but it would be helpful to have a more zoomed in view.  As the previous reviewer mentioned, the coffee is shipped in three plastic bags rather than a box and the "cup" is more of a pouch with a foil lid.  I wasn't sure whether they would work in my brewer, but I'm glad I tried it because the coffee is honestly the best decaf K cup coffee I've had (and I've tried most of them).  This is NOT instant coffee, it is regular, brewed K cup coffee.  This is a great product, I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 because of the confusing picture of the packaging.

review/summary: Works in the B3000 brewer
review/text: I can confirm that the Rogers "One Cup" pods work in the office-size Keurig B-3000 brewer as well as the smaller Keurig brewers.  Sometimes you will see the "No K-Cup Detected" warning, but you can ignore it.  The pods load and eject as well as authentic K-Cups.<br /><br />As for the coffee, it's as the other reviewers say.  Nice body, darker roasted, and more flavor than the decaf offerings from Green Mountain.  A very satisfactory decaf.<br /><br />Opening the bag yields a wonderful fresh-roasted aroma.  As mentioned elsewhere, the bag is not re-sealable, but if you store it in a tightly-closed container, it won't lose the aroma for days.<br /><br />The complaints you hear in some of the comments are actually features to many.  The filter does allow a little very fine sediment through, which is off-putting to a few but adds to the body.  As one would expect from a French Roast, it is decidedly dark.  If you want a mild cup of coffee, you'll want to stay with the Green Mountain, but for those of us who want a stronger and more flavorful cup without the work of using a Solofill or other filter for your own coffee, this is a very welcome product.

review/summary: Good coffee.  Cheaper price.  Happy sipper.
review/text: I was hesitant to try this coffee based on the one review available at the time, but decided to take the risk.  I don't regret that decision.<br /><br />I have no issue with the strength of the coffee, as others have opined.  Although the coffee is not housed in the same type of plastic cup as other brands of Keurig-compatible coffees, but rather in what appears to be a thick filter material, the coffee brews thoroughly.  I found the resulting cup of coffee to be well within the range of perfect strength, and actually leaning toward the darker/stronger end of what I enjoy.<br /><br />I am also pleased with the price, as we finally have a product that should consistently be priced beneath that pesky 60-cent floor, and nearer to 40 cents for those who buy the coffee by subscription.  That is a significant savings!<br /><br />If I could, I might subtract half a star, because I feel that this coffee is not quite as smooth to the palate as some of the higher-end coffees.  However, it is very good coffee and is worth 5 stars.  I will definitely purchase it again (probably by subscription).<br /><br />Happy sipping!  :)

I thought I'd try one and then send them back if it didn't work.  It not only worked, but worked better than K-cups.  I bought the decaf for my husband to enjoy coffee in the evening.  There is more efficiency with this design.  The keurig doesn't poke a hole in the bottom of these and the filter works very well.  There's less mess when you take it out.<br /><br />I will buy these again, especially since the subscribe and save makes them cheaper than traditional k-cups.  The flavor was bold and delicious.

review/summary: Good tasting and great value!
review/text: My wife and I love our Keurig machine.  Now that most of the kids are out of the house we almost never use the old coffee pot.  So, although we're not connoisseurs we look for flavorful coffee in K-cups at reasonable prices (I always consider the cost-per-Kcup).  If you like a rich tasting cup of decaf with a slight "edge" to it, the San Francisco Bay French Roast decaf is a very good choice.<br /><br />Let's face it -- many of the K-cup coffees available for sale are WAY overpriced, even on Amazon.  The San Francisco Bay comes out to about 49 cents a cup, which is tolerable.  The one and only negative about this coffee is that some of the finely ground coffee can push through the filter and leave a small bit of sludge at the bottom of the cup, so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Also, keep the pods in an airtight container if possible -- the open filter design means that oxygen can more easily get to the coffee grounds and affect the taste if they sit around too long.

review/text: Love our Keurig, but I hate to pay a fortune for good coffee, and Amazon always seems to have great options for me.  So as I was shopping for regular coffee and ordered the FogChaser variety, I found the decaf French Roast as well. Surprisingly, the missing bottom to the cup is not an issue! Spouse and I love the coffee, it is strong enough for him, and tasty for me. If you want to recycle the grounds, they are much easier to get to since you only have to tear open the paper basket on the bottom. The cups come in sealed bags of 8 cups at a time to preserve freshness, so buying 36 is no problem.  Also the coffee company has begun adding a plastic sealed container to the box so when you open the bag, you can place them in the sealed container for freshness.  I really like the San Francisco Bay coffees!

review/text: I have been drinking San Francisco Bay coffee for years.  Recent doctors recommendations were to switch to decaffeinated coffee.  I knew SF Bay came in decaf but it was hard to locate.  We purchased a single cup brewing system to accommodate now differing preferences.  I was overjoyed when I found, on Amazon, San Francisco Bay Coffee Decaf One Cup for Keurig Brewers, French Roast, 36 count.  Additionally they have a regular delivery option which saves me from running out of the product and they offer an exceptional price.  This product also creates less impact on the environment with their packaging.

I opted for the eco packaging as well and had no problem with it.  If you were giving as a gift you might want to get the boxed ones though, so they know what they're getting!!

review/text: I drink a LOT of coffee. Mostly half caf, mixing Caffeinated with Decaffeinated. This is easy to do with the single serve coffee makers. I prefer to use the same brand and flavor of Caf and Decaf. There are not a lot of brands which offer both Caf and Decaf. Then it's hard to find a flavor I like even when it is available in both Caf and Decaf. I like the taste of San Francisco Bay French Roast and it comes in both Caf and Decaf. I like their Fog Chaser flavor a lot too but it doesn't come in Decaf.<br />The coffee is held in a little mesh bag not a plastic cup. They claim this packaging is more eco-friendly. Don't know about that and I think the coffee might not stay fresh if the little pouches are stored exposed to the air. Becuase of this I keep them in a seald plastic tub and I use them up pretty quickly anyway.<br /><br />I buy them from Amazon because I can't get it locally and Amazon always has it for a great price and quick delivery.

Also you can see the ammount of coffee in the bag not like the k-cups. GREAT COFFEE !

review/text: The coffee is one of the best I have tried. This is not for those who love weak standard American style coffee. This is the real deal!

review/text: The coffee tastes good, not outstanding but acceptable.  The cuplets work well in the Keurig.  My only negative is they come in sealed bags of 10 or so and once you open the bag, the coffee is exposed to the air as the bottom of the cuplet is filter paper.  Thus I found a large screwtop jar and keep them in that.  Not a big deal but not as convenient as picking up a sealed cuplet and popping it into the brewer.

review/summary: Good flavored decaf & works well in Keurig
review/text: I bought these because I'm trying to wean myself off full-caffeine coffee a bit more.  The flavor from these little pods is great - it doesn't have a watered-down/weak flavor like a lot of decaf blends do IMHO, so I really like these because I don't feel like I'm getting cheated out of my "real" coffee in the morning because I made decaf.<br /><br />As for the filter packs/pods themselves, I was a bit worried at first because of other reviews, but I figured for the price, I would give them a shot.  I think they work great.  Yes, you have to seal up the pods after you open the pouch, but that's not a big deal for me.  I will take having to seal up a bag or canister for less waste in the end.  And they work great in the Keurig.  I still feel like there's this sound of the filter getting punctured when I close the hatch, but it never does.<br /><br />I'm still debating if I want to go with the subscribe & save option, but what's holding me back is the lack of variety.  These could always be my go-to dark roast, and I think I would be good with that!

review/summary: Great Coffee, Great Value
review/text: I have been very pleased with this coffee. The flavor is quite good for decaf and the pods work well in my Keurig brewer. The only slight negative is the packaging for twelve pods coming in non-resealable bags. It is not a huge deal. I just keep the open bag inside a larger ziploc.

review/summary: GREAT TASTE!!!
review/text: The first thing I would like to say is that the bottom of the k cup is a mesh not plastic but it still goes in my keurig machine just like a regular plastic bottom k cup. I don't understand what the fuss is all about.  It does look a little different from what you may be used to seeing, but works just the same. Now as to the taste of the coffee, I think that it is a full body flavor. If I want a strong taste I brew regular size amd if I wish to have a milder flavor I will brew the largest cup size, I have the best of both worlds. I immediately went on subscribe and save.  I order 5 boxes at a time.  Love the flavor of this coffee.  Now to my complaint. I notice today that the price of each box has increased approximately $2.54 a box and that is within about three weeks time. Now I really love the convenience of my Keurig, however eventually the price of the k cups will reach a price that will cause me to say NO MORE. That time is approaching quickly. This brand started out to be more reasonable than most, but with this price jump in the last three weeks I am afraid they (the company) will soon be way overpriced as are the other brands.  Again I will say I do love the flavor of this coffee. Did I mention my husband likes it as well and he normally does not like decaf coffee.

review/text: I read the reviews and got nervous at first.<br />I'm happy I tried it and now I have a monthly subscription, loving the coffee.<br />This is one of the best decafs I've had to date.<br />The lack of plastic is good too, as it seems such a waste.
