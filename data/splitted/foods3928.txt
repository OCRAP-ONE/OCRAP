review/summary: Product was opened. Tamper proof seal broken,
review/text: Product was opened and re-taped with clear box tape. Not cool at all. Last time UPS left on the porch while the sprinklers were on and it was completely soaked. Hit and miss with these. They are wonderful when you get the large size fireballs that are solid in the middle not so much so when you get the smaller ones or the softer ones that dissolve in your mouth readily and break when you bite on them. That is not what I would call a fireball.

review/text: These are the hard to find large fireballs.  These are the fireballs I remember from childhood.  I recently ordered some others and was disappointed to find small fireballs, not at all what I remembered.  After much searching, I ordered the Atomic Fireball Jar and was thrilled to find my old favorite, large fireballs!

review/text: Satisfied with product and it is what I expected.  The only minor complaint I have is the jar they come in does not match the picture.  Not a big deal to me at all but still somewhat misleading and deserves some deduction.  Could be a big deal to others.  They did come in a large, clear, open topped plastic jar but if someone was planning on displaying these in the pictured jar then they might be disappointed.

review/text: Love these babies. If you are a fireball ball lover like me, I recommend buying these in bulk. I purchased two. Good price and you get a ton of fireballs. They will irritate the taste buds a little on your tongue if you suck on too many of these things in a row or two often. LOL

I like these and was disappointed to see that my local Sam's Club had quit carrying them.  The only place I had run across them recently was a mall candy store, where they were horribly over-priced.  It was nice to find them online at a good price.

review/text: Just like I remember them from childhood. The only downside is that they didn't come in the awesome packaging pictured here. They came in a very flimsy tall rectangular plastic box, with an equally flimsy lid. Personally I love these candies. Currently using them as a way to stop smoking (gum works well, but these are just awesome - who needs cigarettes when your mouth is on fire from these babies?) Final thoughts - I love them, will buy again (though I have also gotten a better jar for holding them at home)

review/summary: Hot Stuff!!
review/text: For lovers of cinnamon and hot candies generally, Atomic Fireballs are as good as it gets.  As another reviewer mentioned, the degree of hotness varies from piece to piece, sometimes it has an almost fruity quality and others it's pure cinnamon.  Either way they're good.  I take a bag along on long road trips.  They're guaranteed to wake up a drowsy driver.  If you're lucky enough to live near a B.J.'s Warehouse and get free "trial membership" offers a couple times a year you can load up on the big 200-piece jars even cheaper than offered on Amazon.  You may have to pay sales tax but no shipping.

review/text: Ferrara Pan Candy Company is the only Atomics I know and they have been around since the beginning of time. They are consistent in quality.<br /><br />I buy around 200 each week for people at work. Some people just live on these animals. Others just see how long they can suck on them before changing to the other side of the mouth. It looks like people are going around with fat jaws. When the red coating wears off it seems that they just get hotter. And you can hear the tell tale sound of people crunching to get it over with. Then they come back for more.

Let me tell you, there's a definite burn but as the other review mentions, it's not really off-putting. It's the consistent, enjoyable sort (definitely strong, though) without being throbbing or unpleasant.<br /><br />I'll almost certainly be keeping a stock of this cheese in the fridge from now on. :)

review/text: Currently, the rabbit for this (and the RAW frozen) are sourced from China. Only the Instinct Dry kibble uses rabbit sourced from France. It's an oddity amongst NV's products (everything else seems to be sourced from the US.) Buyer beware as, despite reassurances, Chinese sourced food has had lots of problems (chemical contamination.) Supposedly, at the moment, NV is looking to change the source for the wet canned and frozen to France as well; but it hasn't happened yet.

review/summary: My Dog Goes Nuts for NV Canned Rabbit - Stinks that its sourced from China!
review/text: I have a very picky rottie mix who stopped eating most foods a looong time ago. I have her on an air-dried raw diet that she seems to love but am sad that I can no longer continue the variety I once had in her diet. She gave up on the majority of the canned food she used to eat a long itme ago but I also learned that the only way to find what she tolerates is to spend the cash and experiment.<br /><br />For whatever reason she LOVES this brand canned rabbit - even though she's turned down others. I actually think it has to do with the pork liver; she seems to love certain pork products and I think the mix is what does it. She loves it enough it actually got her to eat when I was on vacation and had to leave her with my ex, and for a picky dog that NEVER wouuld eat at his house it's saying a lot!<br /><br />I actually tried the Nature's Variety canned Duck (also with pork liver) and she ate it the first day but only after a LONG hesitation after she realized she wasn't getting anyting else. (I never feed more than half a can at a time to my dog because I use it for supplemental feeding) By the second day, however, she was licking the bowl clean. The third day when I had run out she was looking at the "wet food" dish so I have a feeling if i purchase it again she'll learn to love it as well.<br /><br />Hopefully I can introduce the entire NV line to keep the variety going in her diet. Unfortunately she has ALWAYS had issues with her BM's being too loose for my liking so I try to not feed a lot of canned. (the raw diet has definitely helped with that, btw....) For many dogs, however, it's a wonderful supplement as they tend to not get enough water throughout the day.<br /><br />P.S. - It truly stinks that the rabbit is sourced from China as I know there have been a lot of issues with any foods sourced from China. (Plus I'd rather not continute to their economy if possible) Unfortunately it appears that a LOT of the treats that she eats are sourced from there, and since she's picky to begin with it's not always easy to make a switch. Her primary food is not from China, however, and she only get treats sparingly. The training treats we use are sourced in the U.S. and hopefully more manufactuers will continue to listen to consumers and stop sourcing their meat products from there.

review/summary: great!
review/text: our dog has terrible allergies and we think we've finally found out that the root of the problem is food. the vet mentioned that dogs do very well with rabbit because it is a species not commonly used in dog food. we started our dog on this food as well as some dry venison/sweet potato food and she has been doing wonderfully!! her hot spots have cleared up, her breath smells better, her fur looks and smells great! no more constant scratching!!! fingers crossed that things stay on this track, but i think as long as she is eating this food she will be fine. and the food looks like a high quality product.

review/text: My 5 dogs love the NV Instinct canned Rabbit food. They were having potty issues with loose stools and stomach problems. I switched them to Natures Variety no-grain dry dog food as well as the canned wet food. Now all their issues have been resolved and they love the food. Their stools are now firm and easy to pick up and dispose of. Now I don't have to beg them to eat their food. Their skin and coat also looks much healthier.

review/text: I had loved the peanuts that are available at "5 Guys Hamburgers". I found out that they came from  Hampton Farms and I ordered the 5 lb. bag from a merchant on Amazon. The peanuts were quite disappointing! No 2 peanuts are the same. In other words, some are roasted until they almost disappear and are hard as a rock, some shells have NO peanuts in them and somtimes you actually get some regular peanuts but they're small. The flavor isn't bad, but that too is inconsistant. It seems the quality of what "5 Guys Hamburgers" gets and what the public gets are way different.

review/text: I love the flavor and don't have the patience for old fashioned grits which can take about 45 minutes to cook. This is the best option between the gross instant grits and the slow cook old fashioned. I like to eat them with a breakfast meat and cheese with a drop of butter.<br /><br />I must point out that anything more than about $2.99 for the 24oz is a bit steep. If you live state-side, check your local grocery store or Target/Walmart to find this product at a reasonable price. However, if you don't have convenient access to a general American grocery store (deployed, overseas, care package, etc.) then perhaps this price may be worth it.<br /><br />Never dissappointed with the taste, just the online price.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.

As a drink-it-all-day choice, it is a winner for me! Some of the "bold" category coffees are good for an occasional boost, but this choice is balanced, smooth, and abundant flavor. It works very well when iced and/or blended with creams & spices. I prefer straight coffee, and this pairs well with food. In fact, depending on your food, the coffee undertones can really bloom on your palate! A very nice coffee and one of my favorites!

review/text: I love my new coffee storage drawer. It hold 30 K cups and it is a good use of space. I sit my Keurig coffeemaker on top of it and my coffee center is is very organized. It does not take up any more counter space than my coffeemaker.

review/summary: Do Not Buy - Doesn't Work
review/text: I really wanted this to work. It looks nice and is a little more narrow than some of the other K-cup drawers. First of all this says it holds 35, but the box it came in says it holds only holds 30. That is not the problem. It looks very nice, I like the material on top, BUT the entire thing slips and slides. The Keurig (B70) slides on top even with a full water reserve. When you pull the drawer the entire drawer, Keurig and all slides as well. That's not the worst part, however, I could get past that and use rubber shelf lining to fix that issue. The worst part that you cannot fix is the fact that even with LESS than 30 K-cups in this drawer it WILL NOT OPEN. The K-cups in the middle column get stuck and jammed due to a metal rod along the top of that column. The K-cups on the ends get stuck on the metal pieces that bend over the top of the columns. This will RUIN your k-cups as they get snagged and pressed by the metal. It took me several minutes to remove K-cups that jammed in the drawer and the drawer would not open. AWFUL. Completely unusable and worthless. I returned this product and instead bought a larger one with rubber mat on top that slides easily (from Bed Bath and Beyond for $20 w/ 20% off coupon. Cheaper, holds more, slides easier, doesn't damage k-cups and won't slide off your counter.

review/summary: Bad
review/text: When I got the product I was under the impression that it was going to work better then it did. the slid out part of mine has been super hard to slide out making it hard to put my K-cups in there so if I had to buy another one I would get a vertical one that does not have a drawer.

review/summary: An OK Storage Drawer
review/text: The storage drawer came in on time just like the shipping message said it would and the product was in good condition but I am not completely satified with this drawer.  Although the drawer holds a good number of K-cups and it does save counter space because it fits under the Keurig it is alittle too small for the K-cups to fit properly.  And every time the drawer is opened or closed the K-cups get all twisted and struck in the drawer so it doesn't shut right.  Plus the drawer squeaks everytime it is opened or closed quite loudly, it doesn't slide as easily as I thought it would.  If I had to do over I probably would not purchase this product.

review/summary: Looks nice, but does not slide open and closed easily
review/text: After reading the reviews on this K Cup holder, I was expecting it to be exactly what I was looking for. While it looks very nice, it does not function well at all. The K Cups get hung up somewhere and prevent the drawer from sliding open and closed easily, and when you are trying to open and close the drawer, the whole unit slides forward or backward on the countertop. I was very disappointed, and I ended up returning this product.

review/summary: K-Cup Coffee Storage Drawer
review/text: Works well for me. The drawer has been modified to have more height so that the tops of the K-Cups don't hang when opening or closing the drawer. It will hold seven K-Cups in each section for a total of 35. It would be nice if an additional section could be designed and added to the drawer to hold sugar packets and stir sticks.

review/summary: Great but bigger than my coffee maker.
review/text: This product arrived very fast to an APO account. I ordered two, One for work and One for my room. I do not have the traditional Kureg maker. I have the black and Decker model and when I center it on the Drawer it has about a good three inches on each side. It works great though. I have the one at work just holding up my mugs and the storage is really nice. If you have the name brand kureg than you'll be fine. Even the space isn't that bad but i don't have a whole lot of space to have taken up.<br /><br />Overall it's a really great little storage solution and I really enjoy it a lot.

review/text: This works just fine and does what its meant to do. My complaint is the design. literally less then a week of using it, it began to make a metal on metal screeching noise whenever I opened it. The noise was so unsettling, I tried everything to fix it & nothing helped.<br /><br />I finally ended up buying the official keurig model from bed bath and beyond, months later its still quiet as a mouse.

review/summary: Storage Drawer
review/text: This storage drawer will hold as many as 35 K-cups.  Built sturdy and slides ok.  Came with a few small dents that probably came out of the factory like that.  Will not effect the usesage but should not have dents when new.  Will not return it though, because of the hassle doing that.  Overall very happy with the product.

review/summary: Not worth the cheaper price - measurements off
review/text: I was very excited when I took this out of the box because I like the design.  But that all ended when I started putting the k-cups in it.  The measurements are off.  Any k-cup with a slightly rounded top will catch when you try to open or close the drawer.  There is not enough clearance.  Also, the drawer is not long enough to hold 7 per each of the 5 rows like advertised.  Again, the measurement if off slightly so it will only hold 6 (for a total of 30) with a little room left over so they do not fit snug.  Which leads to the 3rd problem:  with 2 rails instead of a solid bottom or mesh to sit on, the k-cups tilt so, again, with the poor clearance, they get hung up when you try to open or close the drawer.  Regretfully, this is not as advertised and not measured property to use for k-cups.  I am really not hard to please, but this is way wrong at any price.

review/summary: Bad design
review/text: We bought the coffee storage drawer to store our K-cups under the Keurig coffee maker. The top of the drawer is supported by "ribs" that run underneath from front to back. When you stick the pods in the drawer, the pods in the middle row don't fit easily because of the supporting "rib". In our case, this rib kept tearing the top of our K-cups. This is not a good design for a K-cup drawer.

review/summary: Poorly designed
review/text: I thought this would be the perfect solution to counter clutter and wrangling the k-cups. WRONG! The drawer doesn't slide easily when it's empty never mind with k-cups. The tops of the cups jam up against the top of the drawer when sliding open AND closed. Great concept but poorly designed. Also, the "feet" of the drawer don't have non-skid, non-scratch rubber coverings. With needing more effort to slide the drawer opened or closed, my granite counter would have been scratched after one use. I took it out of the box, tested it once empty, once with k-cups and packed it right back up for return. Sorry guys...but it's back to the drawing board for improvements. I ended up buying the k-cup spinning tower and it works perfectly, straight out of the box!

review/summary: Big Disappointment!
review/text: I love the idea of the drawer that you can put the brewer on top of, but this thing is really lousy. The pods keep getting stuck so it becomes impossible to open/close the drawer. All of the pods fall over every time you do manage to get it open so it just ends up being a big mess.  Huge disappointment!

review/text: I am not impressed with this and am planning to return it.  The pods fall over easily and get stuck.  I even punctured a pod just trying to open and close the drawer.  I live it high altitude and my pods tend to bulge more on top with the air pressure so they don't fit in this very well...they are too tall.  Very disappointed.

review/summary: One cannot close or open the drawer with K-Cups in it
review/text: While the item is decent looking and holds the brewer just fine, it does not close very well (or at all) once you put K-Cups in it.  This defeats the purpose, in my mind, for having the item.  If the manufacturer increased the clearance by 1/8 to 1/4 inch, it would be a nice addition to your coffee area.
