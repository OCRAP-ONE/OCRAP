review/summary: Cuppa Delicious!
review/text: I never had this brand of tea before but have always wanted to try their tea. I should have tried it along time ago. As far as the smell, this flavor slaps you in the face before you even heat the water. I made roughly 36 oz from 1 tea bag. I made it in the 12 oz Aladdin Tea Infuser Mug. I also used a Squeezmo. I like nothing in my tea and insisted that my mother take a sip. Although she likes sugar in her tea, she said she would drink it again with of course sugar. I highly recommend this tea. I can't wait to try their other flavors.

review/summary: Disappointingly not delish
review/text: I'm an olive addict - it's officially a sickness. Granted there was only one review for the product but the line got good reviews in general. What a letdown. Received three jars, opened one and olives were mushy with an odd "off" taste. Second jar was same, off taste, smell and mushiness. I almost threw third jar away unopened but I'm stubborn and I paid a lot for these damn olives! Finally, a decent olive - not great but some proper olive taste, nice brine and crispness. For the cost/shipping I feel ripped off. It's like they sent two bad jars and one good. I won't ever order these from Amazon again. In fact Gristede's carries Mezzetta Martini olives and the olives and Vermouth are really delicious - not a mushy one in the bunch and the liquid makes a great dirty martini. Best, a case of six was less than this order. I've got my fingers crossed they won't be mushy when they arrive. I think the vinegar and vermouth softens the Leone olives - the Mezzetta olives are as sans vinegar. If you love olives give the Mezzetta's try.

review/summary: Delish!
review/text: I have never bought "gourmet" olives in a jar...if I buy olives, I tend to buy greek ones from a deli, or just your standard Spanish stuffed olive at the grocery.  I bought some of these Miss Leone's recently at a close-out store for about $2 a jar, I figured they'd be worth that.  Well, I think they are worth more!  I've had the jalapeno stuffed olives and the martini pimento stuffed ones, they are packed in vermouth.  You really do get a bit of the alcohol and it is wonderful.  They are smooth, meaty, and not overly salty.  The jalapeno stuffed ones have just a nice bit of heat, but are definitely not HOT.  I even drank the liquid in the jar on the Martini Pimento ones, not good for my high blood pressure, I'm sure...but I couldn't stop.  Vermouth is the last item in the ingredient list, but I do think I sensed just the right touch of alcohol. I will definitely purchase more of these, and for a special occasion would pay much more than I did.  I'd say, give them a try yourself if you are an olive lover.

review/summary: A great change
review/text: This pasta is definitely different than white pasta.  Don't expect the same flavor or texture!  However, we love this pasta for what it is.  It is a lot like a sponge and needs much more sauce than white pasta to not taste dry.  Our favorite way to eat it is just with real butter, salt & pepper.  (My kids want this for lunch everyday)  As far as other pasta dishes go, I find that you can't really substitute this.  Tinkyada is a good brand that is much more similar to regular white pasta if you just want the health benefits, but don't want to change your recipes very much.  The flavor of this pasta is much more rich and full than a normal white pasta, or even whole grain pasta.  It will compete with other flavors, so you have to tinker with it and find what you like it with and what you don't.  I don't think it tastes like cardboard though, we really enjoy the flavor.  All in all, the health benefits are so great, we will use this 90% of the time.  Also, I do think the penne is the best shape.  The spaghetti is difficult to work with and overcooks easily.  The penne is delicate, but turns out much better for me.

My son uses these instead of white flour macaroni in his every day favorite mac and cheese after school snack. he still uses the nasty powdered cheese from Kraft, but I think at least he isn't getting a whole ton of enriched flour and useless carb calories.

review/text: I have to agree with one of the earlier reviews. This tastes like cardboard!<br /><br />I was a bit surprised by the taste and had to check if the box I had was within its expiry date. It was fine. So I slowly chewed a few pieces and found it hard to detect any real "taste" (it's hard to explain) and it just didn't taste like any food items I have eaten before. First thing that came to my mind was cardboard. Thankfully I only had one box. The texture was not like normal pasta so it's just whatever ingredients contained in it made into a pasta shape.

review/summary: Ezekiel is the future
review/text: There's no doubting the nutritional value of the Ezekiel formula. It's a miraculous combination loaded with fiber and protein with almost no fat but unfortunately this pasta is very difficult to cook. I wanted so much to make this my new super food at dinner time but I've had little success making it work and the flavor is comparable to nutty cardboard vaguely resembling pasta. I tried under cooking it but it's inedible. Dare not over cook or you will have an Ezekiel porridge. Sorry guys I'm really rooting for you but I have to be honest!

review/summary: Know what you are buying & set your expectations accordingly
review/text: I don't know how people can complain about the taste of this product. I am not sure if they are expecting this to taste exactly like their regular durum semolina pasta but this product has a very acceptable taste and texture for my tastes. This product is the only organic sprouted grain pasta I am aware of and that brings a whole host of health and nutrition benefits. If the nutritional benefits of eating sprouted grains is important to you than I am sure you will find the taste acceptable.<br /><br />I recommend following the cooking directions and staying within the 3 to 4 minute range, I went to 5 minutes and but I tested it at the 3 minute mark, 4 minutes would be about right for me. This is a bolder tasting pasta, it is not as subtle tasting as regular pasta and if you are expecting that, then don't buy this product, plan and simple. Some people have mentioned that it has a 'nuttier' type taste to it and I can definitely agree with that description. It's a very subtle nutty taste though. If you are borderline on the taste, you might want to find a sauce that is bolder tasting.<br /><br />If you are new to non durum based pastas you might want to try going to a whole grain pasta first, which most of the major pasta manufacturers now make. If the taste doesen't bother you then I would try a box of this pasta. The texture of this pasta is on the firm side of al dente, if you try to cook it longer to soften it up it gets kind of gummy.<br /><br />Overall I would give this product a 4 out of 5 because I like the taste but I don't love the taste. It would also be nice if they could give you the option to cook this to various levels of firmness without turning to goo. That being said, I am completely aware that they are working within the constraints of the ingredients used and I think they have done a very good within the confines of the ingredient list.

review/summary: Makes a tasty mac n' cheese!
review/text: I bought two boxes of the penne pasta on sale at our local natural food market.  I boiled one box and probably overcooked it.  The consistency was not like that of regular pasta.  It sort of broke apart, but it tasted fine.<br />I made 4 cups of white sauce with lowfat milk and plain soymilk (just thought I'd try combining - I used mostly lowfat milk), corn starch, margarine (Smart Balance) and salt and pepper.  Then I sprayed the rectangular Corningware dish with cooking spray,  I mixed the penne pasta with the white sauce in a pan, then I spread the mixture in the baking dish.  I stirred in chunks of cheddar cheese flavored almond "cheese" and sprinkled parmesan cheese and paprika on top.  I decided to add a drained 9.75 oz. can of Swanson's chicken breast, so I stirred that in on top as well.  I topped all of this with a small amount of Panko bread crumbs, more parmesan cheese and some pieces of mozzarella cheese and small pats of Smart Balance.  I baked the mixture at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. It worked out to be very moist, tasty and creamy comfort food - packed with protein and certainly with less cholesterol and a much lower glycemic index than regular macaroni and cheese.  I am most pleased with my creation and this pasta does work in a casserole.  It absorbs the flavors of other ingredients.  Happy Concocting!

review/summary: Excellent Shampoo
review/text: I purchased this shampoo for my Maltese. I have been using an Oatmeal Shampoo and was satisfied with it, but I wanted to try something for Whitening and to see if I could improve on my dogs coat. Several blogs had recommended Bio-Groom and this Super White Dog Shampoo was specifically mentioned for the Maltese.<br /><br />This shampoo is concentrated at a 1 to 4 ratio. So, I put a little in a cup and added some water and stirred it up and used it. It wasn't very "sudsy" but it did lather-up nicely. It is listed as a Conditioning Shampoo, so I bathed him without Conditioning him. I didn't expect much because the Shampoo didn't have hardly any fragrance and it just seemed kinda "ho hum."<br /><br />The results were obvious when I started drying him. His coat became full and and very soft. It was as if I had Conditioned him. His coat was easy to comb and was bright white. I know you're supposed to moisten the coat before you brush your dog, but with this shampoo I haven't needed to. My Maltese has a "Cottony" coat, so it is not a show dog. So all you professionals out there, don't hate on me if I'm not doing things exactly correct. Although he is not a show dog, this product has helped a great deal. I am very happy with this product.

review/summary: excellent for cooking
review/text: This oil is fantastic for many great tasting recipes and for Asian cooking in general. Also this oil seems to withstand high heat without burning. In my house we use it all the time for many different dishes. Sesame oil contains vitamin E which is an anti-oxidant. This means it helps lower your cholesterol.<br /><br />I like to cut up broccoli, peppers (green and red), brussel sprouts and a chicken breast. Then I add soy sauce, hot sauce, ginger & garlic paste, water and of course sesame oil. You only need a little sesame oil. Less is better here because if you put too much the sesame oil will overpower the other flavors. A teaspoon or a little less is just right. This makes a quick tasty meal when mixed and stirred in a hot pan on high heat. It only takes about 10 minutes and serves at least 2 people. Very simple and quick meal that tastes great with sesame oil.<br /><br />I'm sure there are loads of tasty sesame oil recipes. All you have to do is search the internet and you'll be busy for hours if you like to cook. The main thing is to use it sparingly. This oil is dark, rich and very tasty.

I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.<br /><br />Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.<br /><br />I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!

review/summary: An excellent pepper spice for Japanese food lovers
review/text: House shichimi togarashi (7 flavored pepper spice) is a very popular brand of seasoning and this distinct little red glass jar is often found on countertops in ramen shops and izakayas across Japan and the US. It is an excellent spice to sprinkle on top of ramen, fish, grilled chicken skewers, okonomiyaki, and any other food you'd like to add a little fire to.<br /><br />Shichimi doesn't just bring heat. It adds texture, flavor, and a small amount of added nutrients from the seeds in the mixture. Shichimi in Japan usually contains hemp seed as one of the 7 ingredients, which gives the spice a good crunch. For export to the US, this ingredient has been replaced. Aside from that, this is a true taste of a Japanese favorite.<br /><br />Be sure to put the cap back on tightly after use so that no moisture gets into the bottle. When that happens, the powdered ingredients will start to stick together and become difficult to shake out of the hole.

review/text: I simply love Keurig coffee, particularly Timothy's French Roast. And the opportunity to buy it at a really great price makes my morning even more fabulous. If you have not tried Keruig and Timothy's you should. When I buy it at my store, I usually have to settle for another brand, with only 18 K-cups to the box; and it does not make the 16 ounce size I love. But Timothy's does. I like buying from Amazon because their offer of 2 24-count boxes for $29.95 and NO SHIPPING saves me about 50 cents per large cup. No need to stop for gormet coffee....I can brew my own. Way to go!

review/summary: Rich, dark roast coffee........
review/text: I was given a Keurig coffee brewer for Christmas 2008, since receiving it I have tried many different kinds and brands of coffee.  I'm still trying to find my "favorite", since I like so many of them!  This one is delicious if you like a dark robust cup of coffee.  It's rich enough that I can get two cups of coffee from one K-cup.......I make the largest cup size first, and then have a refill using the smallest cup size, second cup is just as good as the first.  I've recently had the Kona blend, Columbian and another one of my favorites, Paul Newman's Own......which is also a dark roast, so far this French roast and Newman's Own are on the top of my list of favorites.  It's really fun to sample different coffee's and I haven't found one that I couldn't drink, they're really all quite good.

It provides a tasty spin in traditional oil and vinegar dressings.

review/summary: A Great Cup of Tea
review/text: I was traveling a lot for work and was on a 2 year contract, so I stayed at a hotel from Sunday night through Thursday morning every week.<br /><br />When I'd arrive late on Sunday, I'd ask them to please send me up a pot of tea - my travel time was 6 hours and I was usually pretty tired.  The hotel always sent up a pot of this wonderful Vanilla black tea - I'd never seen it before and it was so great.<br /><br />When the contract was over, I looked for this particular French Vanilla black tea, but couldn't find it where I live.  Then about a year later, I decided to search on Amazon for French Vanilla black teas, and there it was - the exact same label and the same wonderful fragrance and taste!<br /><br />When it arrived, I made myself a cup and, well, it was exactly as I'd remembered.  I'm so glad I found it again.

review/text: This is not a bad coffee - it's smooth, has no aftertaste, not bitter, etc.  However, it really doesn't taste too much like chocolate or raspberry to me.  It can smell the chocolate and raspberry when I open the package and fill up the coffeepot, but it kind of ends there.  Once it's in my mug, I really don't taste anything other than coffee.  To me it has an ever-so-slight smoky (but not burnt!) flavor.  It's not unpleasant...it's just not chocolate or raspberry.

review/summary: Thank god for this formula!
review/text: Happy baby = Happy Mommy.<br /><br />After having breastfeeding problems with my little guy right from the start, we started supplementing with formula. I used the free samples of Enfamil Newborn that I had received. It worked for a couple weeks until I noticed a real problem with fussiness and gas. He was crying most of the time while up and I couldn't put him down, always wanted to be rocked. So I switched to the GentleEase, which seemed to make no difference other than he was now gassy in his sleep. Next...tryed Gerber Good Start...even worse. He started having Colic screaming fits, so back to the Enfamil I went, and along came constipation! Started getting balls of poop!<br /><br />Note: Baby is 6 weeks old. No spitting up, just extreme fussiness and gassy symptoms that the gas drops or gripe water had no effect on. I changed bottles several times also, finally found the drop-in system worked the best. Irritable Baby = Cranky Mommy<br /><br />Dr. recommended Similac Sensitive for lactose problems and gave me some samples. I have no history in my family of lactose intolerance, but I have a sensitive tummy myself. I noticed a significant change in his behavior after about 3 bottles. He is now finishing his bottles, feeling full and happy in between. I can finally put him in his bouncy chair or lay him down to play with out immediate screaming fits. And now come the smiles :) Poor guy was just really upset cuz his tummy was upset.<br /><br />The ready made formula seems a little thicker and smells different, and so does the concentrated stuff. This powder is lighter in color and texture when mixed. Doesn't seem to matter to my little guy though. Dissolves better than other powders I have used, less clumps.<br /><br />The only reason this didn't get 5 stars...The Powder makes a VERY FOAMY mixture. Make the entire days worth of formula so the bubbles have a chance to settle. My first bottle made him very gassy still...defeats the purpose right?<br /><br />Hint:  Mix with warm water to minimize foam/bubbles...stir with a fork or spoon instead of shaking to mix. Or make a whole batch and let it sit, gently swirl to mix up before making a bottle. If immediate bottle is needed, add 1-2 DROPS of Mycalon (or similar) gas drops and it takes the bubbles out instantly. (I'm not a dr. so I don't recommend this to babies with health problems and such).<br /><br />So far, Target has been the cheapest price I have found for this product. :)

review/summary: This formula was the magic key!
review/text: We started our daughter out on Good Start as a newborn and around 3 weeks she started crying all of the time.  So we took her to the pediatrician and he said to try Similac Sensitive.  It's really easy on the tummies.  He also said to try phasing her out of it around 4 months when her digestive system is a little more stable.  The similac has been a life saver!  She was such a happy baby afterwards.  We did try switching her to a generic brand at 4 months because of the money savings, but the same problems started immediately.  We asked her pediatrician about it and he said she was probably lactose sensitive and Similac Sensitive is lactose free.  We tried a few different lactose free generic brands (still trying to save money), but they made her constipated which made her fussy and uncomfortable again.  I had a box of similac that was recalled.  The month in-between the recall and them getting back out on the shelves was a long one for us and our daughter.  So, although I have hated paying the higher costs, I am appreciative that they made a product that allows my daughter to be healthy and comfortable.

review/summary: less bowel movement
review/text: I am breatfeeding, and use formula when breastfeeding is not enough. We used Similac advanced first. The baby took it good first, then got fussy and we can hear her swallowing when she was not eating. she had a little spit up too. The doctor said it was probably reflux. So we switched to Similac Sensitive which is lactose free. We are all happy with it until after about a month, her bowel movement significantly reduced. She used to poop 4 or more times a day. Now she poops every 5 to 7 days. We are worried, but she does not have fever, eats good, sleeps good, and the poop still looks normal, although smells really bad. And she is sweet most of the time. I am feeding her water as doctor suggested. But I am wondering if I shall try something else again.

review/summary: Long time trusted name
review/text: Similac has been around for a long time & is still a trusted company in my opinion. I was feeding my daughter the formula when the recall hit in mid 2010. I had 3 large containers that were part of the recall. Yes, Similac had a slip in their quality, hence the recall. BUT, they handled it with ease & it was very swift & easy to return my 3 containers for a full refund. They actually gave me quite a bit more money with the check than I actually paid for them in the first place. They also sent some very generous coupons for future formula purchases.<br /><br />I acknowledge & they have acknowledged a mistake was made & we are both moving on. I continue to use this product & my 5 month old is very happy on it. :)

review/summary: My little one was even more fussy and spit up a lot!
review/text: We started our infant on Gentlease since we had a sample-in addition to breastfeeding. He seemed ok on it aside from a lot of spit up. We then went to Emfamil Newborn thinking maybe the thicker formula would work better for spit up. It did, no intense spit up but he got constipated off the bat. So, going through Costco I found Similac Sensitive for Gas and Fussiness and found this to be similar to Gentlease. Costco has it available in bulk and we couldn't beat the price!<br /><br />Immediately we noticed our newborn getting bad bouts of fussiness after feedings. It was horrible! He had normal bowel movements but the thin, frequent spit up was back. With such a huge container, we thought we would have to wait it out and add it to another formula until it was out. Thank god Costco has a really good return policy, we gave it almost a week and that container was returned right back to the store and we got Costco's formula + gas drops in his bottles and have had no problems.<br /><br />I didn't like Gentlease for the spit up issues and he feeds more frequently on such a thin formula, but I'd much prefer Gentlease over this stuff.
