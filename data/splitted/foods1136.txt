review/text: Love that it's fresh...  Husband says it's not a "true" paraguayan cut, as paraguayan cut is larger-  and this does tend to be a tad bit powdery- HOWEVER, it is VERY fresh and delicious!  Love it. :)  Five stars all around.

review/text: verry good tasty yerba mate, a bit harsh at first i recommend adding sugar or honey on the first fill for newbies and a bit of lemon , the taste then will become more light after the third refill, the seller shipped this faster than i thought. It arrives verry quickly i recommend from this seller. I will keep buying pounds from here.

review/summary: Our favorite mate
review/text: My husband doesn't do well with coffee and coffee doesn't really work to keep me awake anymore (but I do LOVE it). When we go on road trips or if we don't have enough sleep before work, we brew a pot of mate in the french press instead of coffee. It's great if a pinch of peppermint leaves are added to the pot.<br /><br />This yerba mate is great hot or iced, brewed light or strong, sweetened or unsweetened. It is a very versatile, earthy tea, and it is well received by guests when I've served it.<br /><br />The amount sold in this listing lasts a LONG time if you brew light to medium strength. We store it in a quart sized glass mason jar (usually Ball brand) to keep it fresh in large amounts.

review/summary: Why isn't this more popular in the states?
review/text: This stuff is reaaaly neat. I am a tea drinker, no coffee for me. Not too long ago I've never even heard of it, then one day I run across it online. As much caffine as a cup of coffee, more antioxidants than green tea, and tastes like chocolate? That sounds like big claims you always hear but never live up to. But, it's ture with this stuff. Im not quite sure why this stuff isnt as popular in the US as it should be. I brew it in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPN8TK">Adagio Teas 16-Ounce Ingenuitea Teapot</a> and its just awesome.

review/text: Blenheim Ginger Ale's Spicy Sampler pack is 12 bottles of some of the finest ginger ale I have ever tasted. When I say 'ginger ale', I do not mean the overly sweet, ginger-free tasting sodas commonly passed off as said product; I mean the actual, genuine article.<br /><br />Even the 'mild' has quite a kick to it, it is the kind of spice that opens up your sinuses and leaves you with a pleasant tingle in the mouth. It's sweet at first, with some of the floral notes you expect from real ginger, followed by a hint of lemon-y acidity, with the aforementioned sinus-burn (similar to horseradish) as the last note.<br /><br />Really, truly delicious on its own, and when mixed with a good whiskey, even better.

review/text: Most ginger ales are mixers - they add a sweet little bubble to your liquor, or what have you.<br />Blenheim is not. It's spicy, pungent, carbonated ginger at its finest. If you want your nose to itch and your taste buds to be delighted, this is what you're looking for.<br />Though best consumed alone, it also makes an excellent companion for spiced rum.

review/summary: My family is obsessed with these pretzels!  If you like chocolate, caramel and pretzels - this is your holy grail!
review/text: I bought these on a whim because they were on sale on Amazon one day and I am SO glad that I did.  My family and I love chocolate, caramel and pretzels and this is the perfect mix of those flavors in a crunchy, salty-sweet treat.  Both canisters were properly sealed and the pretzels were fresh.  After being open for about a week they started to get a little stale but they were so popular with my kids that they didn't make it much past a week before they were devoured.  I can't say enough good things about these pretzels.  Also, we ordered them in the fall and even though we live in Florida, they weren't melted.  Good packaging Amazon!

When I saw them on Amazon's Manager's Special for approx. half the retail price I decided to give them a try.  They are fantastic!  The combination of caramel and the 3 chocolates make for a most unusual snack.  They are not overwhelmingly sweet either, just a nice balance of the thick pretzels and the candies  -- great with coffee or a latte.  Hope to see the peanut butter FunkyChunkys on Amazon soon!

My mother sent me ice trays and i purchased the Black sage honey and it has been my own personal ice tea tea bar. I just finished 2 the Raspberry lemon mate and strawberry lemonade within a month.<br />Each tea had a bold distinct flavor and drink "texture" individualy that i barely put any honey or Rock sugar to sweeten them. I like the raspberry lemon mate on its own ot mixed with blueberry roobios and/or strawberry lemonade very pleasant smell. The Roobios tropica has the subtle flavor so its great for getting the tea tate when mixing with the herbal teas.<br /><br />The only downside is that because its by a weight of 2 oz. each, I felt gypped with non-roobios teas. The pineapple Kona pop, strawberry lemonade, and rasberry lemon mate had bigger, pretty, "airy" but heavier bits and pieces. The roobios teas are super fine and lasted quite long.<br />When putting them in the tins, the teas filled less than half of the tins it came with.<br /><br />Overall, product is amazing as a sampler, price is ok(6oz. of each would have been golden along with scoop. also<br />Even though red tea make a good iced tea i wished they put more of a variety of tea types like flavored black, white or green tea.

They are also a good texture.  Now, I love gummy bears, but not when I am working out.  These are soft, yet firm and not sticky.  To me, eating something like a really sticky, sweet gummy, while or just after exercising is yucky.  These won't make ya feel all gooey gross.  They taste good, too.  In fact, therein lies the rub.  They are so tasty (and they are organic, so that makes them healthy, right? :-)  ), that every member of the family ends up digging into them, even when they are not working out/competing.  We finally gave up trying to ration them and just subscribed!

review/text: If you like refried beans that taste like just beans, no major spiciness or additional veggie ingredients, you will like these. These refried beans are hearty and easy to use in a variety of recipes. And with the lower sodium count, you are more likely to be able to incorporate these into a low-salt diet.<br /><br />I use these for nachos. I spread the beans on organic corn tortilla chips, top the whole thing with about a 1/4 portion of cheese (by that, I mean that I use maybe 1/4 of a cup for a 2-person portion; I guess you could say that I am cutting cheese out of my diet as much as possible), and stick it all in the oven for a few minutes, just long enough for the cheese to melt and the beans to warm up.<br /><br />Then I top the baked result with organic salsa.<br /><br />Wonderful!<br /><br />These beans make great bean-n-cheese tacos, too.<br /><br />Healthy and delicous--enjoy!

While they MAY be safe - I don't want to take that chance - and they were not advertised as "scratch and dent" type item.<br /><br />Update:  Contacted AMZ as item not eligible for return.  They told me to keep or throw away the dented cans and they sent me a replacement case in 2 days.  All cans in good shape on replacement.<br /><br />Great product - the glitch was somewhere in the order filling process.  We will continue to buy this product.

review/summary: Best ever, and gives me lots of low cost energy
review/text: My taste buds aren't ruined with fast food salt and grease.  I LOVE being able to taste real food with Amy's unsalted brand.  They use such good tasting ingredients I can enjoy these refried beans, even without adding salsa.  Noticed I wouldn't be hungry for a long time after eating a few tacos made with these beans.  That's a huge deal when someone has low blood sugar issues.  Nice to just live my day instead of constantly trying to eat small meals to keep sugar levels from crashing.<br /><br />I keep a case of cans at work with some taco shells so I always have a quick, cheap meal on hand.

review/text: This is the strangest tasting Amy's brand (or any other brand I have ever tried) refried black beans I have ever ate.  I have tried every brand that I ever found, it this one just tastes odd, and I like the regular Amy's refried black beans.  I think it is all the extra ingredients, specifically the green bell pepper and onion that give it such an odd sweet flavor, but I am not sure as I have never studied the ingredients before.  Under lying that sweetness is just a bland, non existent, "watery" flavor that does nothing for me.  I would have preferred a spicy flavor, so I have to add my own.  I will not reorder.

review/text: So, I am a candied fruit slice fanatic, so please consider that I am extra picky in this category of candy.  My ideal fuit slice is one in which the rind (the part outside that thin sugar, white line) is really aldente, the fruit is somewhat dry and which provides some resistance to my teeth.  I found these to be, in general, too wet and too soft.  Perhaps I could have let them dry out in the air and get a little stale but I didn't try that.  I think, instead, I will try another brand.

review/summary: Salsa of the Month was Great!
review/text: I just received The Salsa of the Month Club package and everything was great!  I was excited to try two new salsas from different specialty companies that I would've never been able to try.  They arrived in a sturdy box with foam packing peanuts.  I admit that I was a little nervous that they wouldn't arrive safely, but the glass jars were completely fine.  They were even accompanied by a newsletter giving some background about the salsas and the companies who made them.  They both looked so good, it was hard to decide which one to open first!  My wife and I decided to open the Pink's Mild Salsa from Pennsylvania to accompany our fajitas that we were making for dinner.  It was bold, fresh and made with minimal ingredients and also contained no allergens.  Medically, my wife has to follow a Gluten Free diet, so we are always concerned with allergens and trying to eat foods closer to nature.  A few days later we opened the second salsa (after scraping the first jar dry) and were equally impressed!  The second jar was a Picante Salsa from Hillside Orchard farms in Georgia and was very flavorful and had some visibly large cilantro pieces (my favorite), but was not as chunky as the other one.  This one was great to pour over tacos, as it had more of a sauce consistency, but it was a little harder to pick up with a chip.  Overall, I was very satisfied and I'm looking forward to next month's salsas!  This was the perfect gift for us and would highly recommend the Salsa of the Month Club!

review/text: I was hesitant to purchase this based on the only review, which complained about getting only 1 bottle.  The title clearly says 6 bottles.  The earlier review implied that they bought it from somewhere other than Amazon.  At the time I purchased, though, this item was sold & shipped by Amazon, so I didn't hesitate long.  I knew Amazon would make the matter right if I only received 1 bottle.  But I didn't - there are six.  And, the 2 oz bottles are twice the size of most extracts sold in the grocery store.  So my only problem is - how will I use all this lemon flavoring up!  I haven't purchased a lot of grocery items yet from Amazon, but so far, every one has been quality as well as a good deal.

review/summary: Fabulous food and a little goes a long way....
review/text: I have two cats who are in the process of learning how to be "real cats" again.  That is, they are learning to like MEAT and not that nasty dry food made out of corn, wheat, and lord knows what else.  That nasty dry food is called "crack for cats" and with good reason, as the dry food is nothing more than corn kibbles that have  sprayed with an animal digest product (kind of like bullion soup broth) and dried.<br /><br />Anyway, I went to PetSmart and bought this product on clearance, 97 cents a can.  I also bought cans of WellNess, Nutro, BlueMountain, FancyFeast, Sophisticat (the store brand,) Avoderm, Friskies, Meow Mix, and others, making sure that I chose only those items which have meat products among the first 4 ingredients, and NO corn or wheat gluten. I am doing research to determine which nutritional canned products are most-liked by my cats.<br /><br />Okay, so this product is 95% meat. I put 2 teaspoons on a saucer and Tiki, half-tabby and half marbled Savannah, 8 months old and already 9 pounds--  went nuts. She loved it!  She's a semi picky cat, so-so with Newman's Organics, Friskies, Meow Mix, and Fancy Feast, while Whiskas and 9-Lives are paws down. She hates raw.  Poor girl, she had been fed dry Science Diet at the pound (she had been abandoned by a bad breeder) and her wild cat instincts are dull.  But I have never seen Tiki react to a wet food like this.<br /><br />Now, when I put the food in front of our Bengal, Tonga, a real dry-food addict, she just pushed it away with her paw and yawned. I've noticed that the better quality the food, the more Tonga dislikes it.  I think this is because  Tonga is almost 4 years old and she has had a habit of just nibbling on nasty dry food throughout the day. She's going to be a harder convert.<br /><br />It's been two days since I've taken the "cat crack" away from both kitties and this is a traumatic period for both (!), but if Tiki is loving this product, then it must be yummy!  Smart girl, she knows what is good for her.

review/text: This is some goooood candy. The bag is, as others have mentioned, not filled completely, but it's still a lot of strawberry puffs! Definitely my favorite candy, and I'm glad Amazon has it or else I'd have to buy it for a ridiculous price at the mall candy store. By the way, these are perfect for road trip vacations; you hardly notice the long driving hours when you're munching on this goodness.

review/summary: Strawberry puffs
review/text: I first came upon this candy at a gas station in Texas. I was looking to satisfy my sweet tooth while on a road trip you see I'm from the mid-west and I had never seen this Trolli Strawberry Puffs before. So when I came back home I went to the store and looked for them and to my surprise I couldn't find them anywhere!! So while shopping on Amazon I decided to look for them and I found them! They tasted just as delicious as I remember them... although I have to say the bag isn't quite as full as I would like it to be, but other than that two thumbs up!

review/text: We just tried Wild Thymes Chili Ginger Honey Marinade and love it!  We marinated wild Alaskan salmon in a small amount of the marinade and roasted it in the oven. It added just the right amount of flavor without overpowering the dish. A little went a long way, so it added very few calories per serving.  We also love that while it is not sugar free, it is lower in sugar than similar products on the market, and it is made from a simple list of ingredients without additives.

I do almost everything, grilled cheese sandwiches, mac and cheese, enchildadas, lasagna, etc.  We can not eat cow's milk cheeses, and we didn't like the taste of goat's milk cheeses.  Are friend's that can eat normal cow's milk cheese, love Istara's Sheep's milk Cheese.

review/summary: The best root beer ever made!
review/text: Gotta have my Barq's!!!  This root beer, with caffeine in it, is amazing.  When I need a little extra but don't really want coke or Dr Pepper, I get me a Barq's and the "bite" it has in it as opposed to other root beers, is just what I'm needing.  My son loves them, my dad loves them, my husband will even drink one every once in a while - and that's saying a lot, because he typically doesn't enjoy root beers!  A winner with our family, for sure!

review/text: This is the best root beer around.  Has a bite to the taste.  Very good.  There is a new design on the can.  Yuk!  Hate it.  Someone was lazy with the design.  It looks plain.  Why change a good thing?  When I first opened the 12 can box, I thought I bought the wrong soda.  Ok, I know I can get use to it but, I'd rather not.  Why do companies do this?  Who makes these decisions? They should have their head examined.  :-)

review/summary: Love root beer, but if you can find locally, it's cheaper!
review/text: I agree with other reviewers - this is the BEST root beer, in my opinion.  A&W doesn't taste right too me, especially when I compare it to this.  A nice big iced glass of Barq's with extra foam on the top - YUM!!  BUT, isn't this a little expensive?  It could be worse, I'm sure, but you can get soda on sale for like 3 for $12 or less, plus you don't have to pay shipping.  So, I gave it 3 stars for the price, not the product.  If you can't find it in your area, than it's worth paying a little more for sure!

review/summary: My Cats Love This!
review/text: All cats are different, but in my experience both my personal pets and cats I rescue/foster seem to really love this food. I bought it initially because of the high calorie content when trying to put weight on finicky eaters and ill rescue kittens. I wasn't prepared for them to go CRAZY over this. I thought it might smell really gamey but it's fairly bland-smelling to me.<br />I keep a few cans in my first aid stock.<br /><br />It's expensive but has actually saved some cats when they refused to eat other foods or needed extra nutrition. My IBD senior loves it and it keeps weight on her.<br /><br />As with any 100% meat food, this is to be used in conjunction with kibble or another balanced food.

review/text: No problem with the vendor or the shipping. My cat used to love this product & looked forward to getting it each night when I got home from work. I would  say "beaver" & he would come running & wait by his dish. This last batch is dry & my cat won't eat it. I even bought a can from a local pet food store & found the same problem. When I talked to the pet food store owner she said there have been a lot of complaints. I won't buy this product again & wonder what has changed  with the manufacturer. The local pet food store owner said this company is very difficult to deal with & it probably wasn't worth my time complaining because they are unresponsive. Maybe they'll care about quality when people stop buying their product.

review/summary: Smells weird, but dog loves it
review/text: I have to say that this stuff definitely smells like it did indeed come out of some backwoods swamp or something. It doesn't smell horrible like green tripe or anything like that, but just smells swampy. Anyway, regardless of what I think, my dog loves it, and it did actually help him put on a couple pounds, which was my purpose for getting it. Beaver is supposed to be high quality food with a high calorie content. I wouldn't feed this to my dog all the time, but I'd buy it again.

review/summary: there ought'ta be a law....
review/text: I tried this on a banana recently and I have to agree with the other five star reviews that there should be some sort of warning label about how addictive this stuff could be. Nothing like Nutella in flavor *or* texture and that for me is a *good* thing; the best I could do to try to explain the difference would be to compare/contrast - Nutella is to Hershey's what Nocciolata is to Godiva. Not that I have anything against good ol' Hersheys but my palate has grown up a bit over the years and I happen to LOVE the less sweet, more natural taste of this spread.<br /><br />To me, this tastes more like milk chocolate than dark which the description says it is made with; makes sense as it does contain milk too. You definitely taste the fresh toasted hazelnuts as well. The texture is great for dipping that banana in the two tiny teaspoons the label says I can have. Somehow with the perfect balance of chocolate and hazelnut just that little bit does seem to satisfy my cravings though.

review/text: I have not tried another brand of prickly pear cactus syrup to compare but this is delicious and an excellent compliment to tequila. I found a terrific recipe that is similar to a Tequila Sunrise called a Sonora Sunset. Instead of orange juice, you use grapefruit juice and instead of grenadine, you use this syrup. Gorgeous and refreshing. The sweetness of the syrup is a nice contrast to the tartness of the grapefruit juice. Don't waste your time getting the small bottle, get the big bottle and save on shipping.
