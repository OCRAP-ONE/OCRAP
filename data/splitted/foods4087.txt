review/summary: Awesome, Refreshing Organic Mints
review/text: I was hesitant about buying a pack of six bags since this was my first time trying these mints, but wow - I will not go back to the chemically sweetened mints after tasting these!  They are refreshing, cool mints with just a hint of sweetness.  They are not bitter at all - they taste great and natural.  Love them!  :)

review/summary: Awsome - think organic Altoids
review/text: They're organic, they've got some awesome minty power in your mouth, and they're pretty cheap.  These mints remind me of Altoids, 'curiously strong' seems an apt description.  They're not the type of candy you shovel into your mouth a handful at a time, one will last a while and probably going to be painful to eat several at once.  Helps me resist the urge to munch mindlessly while working at the computer. Because they're extra minty strong, I find them pretty satiating one at a time, consequently a bag lasts a [little] while.  By way of example, the half-life of a bag of gummy bears at work is about 10 minutes, YummyEarth Organic mints is closer to a few days but, I get a lot more enjoyment out of the mints. Seems to be pretty good for a cough too, at least that's the excuse my co-workers have been using lately to grab a few.<br /><br />In short, I like them a lot, my friends love'em, my son (12yo) asks for them, and you probably shouldn't leave them out in the open unless you're really the sharing type (of course you are!) since they will disappear.  If you find yourself buying mints at convenience store check out lines, want something to 'freshen your mouth' after that morning Starbucks, or your kids get an occasional sweet tooth going on, you should definitely give them a try.  They come in packs of 6, so throw one in the kitchen, another in your desk, one for the co-workers, the glove compartment...and spread a few more around for good measure.

review/text: We absolutely love these mints. After having read what most brand-name gums contain, we started looking for healthier alternatives. This is a wonderful find. Not overly sweet, just a clean, fresh flavor that is so very much better than artificial mint flavors! Each is individually and well wrapped, making it easy to carry a 2-3 in a suit pocket for the day.

I am very happy with these mints and will continue to recommend an purchase Yummy Earth products in the future!

review/summary: Refreshing and clean-tasting
review/text: WOW I can really tell the difference between these and every other kind of mint. Clean-tasting means these don't coat my teeth with ick like some other candies do and the mint flavor is very crisp. Never going back to ick-mints after these. Glad I bought them.<br /><br />I've read the other reviews that compare them to Altoids ... I'm not going that far. These have a milder bite, that I actually prefer. I think Altoids go too far. I don't get that feeling in the back of my throat/sinuses that starts to make my eyes water.<br /><br />Size-wise these have a diameter between the size of a dime and a nickel. So, they could be a bit bigger. They look hand-made because each one is slightly unique ... nothing like those candies that are all exactly the same.<br /><br />The individual wrapping is very good so they're very easy to take-along.

review/text: I bought these to crush up and add to homemade peppermint bark. They were not great for this use because they were extremely minty and not very sweet at all. They were also too hard to crush easily. I did use them sparingly for the peppermint bark, and the flavor was okay. But, these are less like a candy and more like a breath mint. Still, the ingredients are great and natural, so they are probably one of the best breath mints out there.

It came late (ordered 10/18, recieved 11/5).  It is damaged (chipped in one corner), dirty (covered with plaster-like dust), and will break the first time it is dropped or bumped.  I probably could've used clay and some plaster to make a cast of simliar quality myself. Don't waste your money!

review/summary: The secret to classic Thai taste
review/text: Golden Mountain Sauce is the secret ingredient that makes Thai dishes come alive. You may be able to find it in Asian food stores by the Thai fish sauce.  You can also order it from one of the Asian gourmet or grocery vendors at Amazon.com.  Look for "naturally fermented" on the label; otherwise you may be buying hydrolyzed soy protein (used in fake soy sauces) which is unhealthy and potentially toxic in high levels.  Check with the vendor PRIOR to purchasing to ensure you are getting the "naturally fermented" product.

I was so happy when I tried these Hint of Salt Triscuits.  I was unhappy when my local Kroger stopped selling them!  I can only find them in one small grocery store and they're usually sold out!  Enter Amazon.  Like the reviewer before me I am thrilled with the natural list of ingredients.  I tried another brand that made a triscuit-like cracker and there were at least 20 ingredients and they tasted so weird/fake.  Next I'd like them to make the Reduced Fat Triscuits with a Hint of Salt.  Please Nabisco?

review/summary: Really Does Help Your Skin
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker and came across this tea with wonderful reviews on how it helps clear up your skin. I have perfectly clear skin on most of my face except on my chin area. For some reason I break out horribly around that area and despite my efforts and products galore, I still have a hard time keeping that spot clear. I would say after a week of drinking the tea, my skin started to change dramatically. My chin area started to clear up and I noticed no new pimples coming in. I get the cyst like pimples in that area which feel like they last forever and can be very painful. Even the rest of my skin which was always clear had almost like a glow to it. I will continue to drink this tea as directed. I always drink my teas on their own without any sugar or cream and the taste has a nice flowery hint to it and doesn't taste bad at all.

The amount is much less (18 mg) than that in coffee (90 mg for 8 oz), but as someone who's quite sensitive to caffeine, I really can't drink more than one cup per day, and only in the mornings. Still, it tastes wonderful!

review/summary: Best I've ever had!
review/text: These are the best tasting and crunchiest pistachios I have ever eaten. Without added salt you can really taste the sweetness of the nut, I love them... On a freshness scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest I would give them a 20. I'll be back for these again and again.

review/text: Amazing price for great quality pistachios. Someone said something about them being tiny but that is not the case at all. They are normal size I would say. You can definitely tell that they are not salted but it's not a bad thing. I taste more of the pistachios and don't miss the salt at all. Will probably buy again when I run out.

review/summary: Keenan Farms unsalted pstachios
review/text: These nuts are so fresh and absolutely delicious!!! Once I start eating them I find I can not stop.<br />The pistachios in the shell are the way to go, because having to shell them yourself does slow you<br />down from eating as many. The unsalted pistachio is much more tasty and healthier, especially for<br />those people that must watch their salt intake.

review/text: It is much better to have them unsalted than regular pistachios you buy from grocery stores that come with so much salt! I just can't believe how people don't understand the side effects of salt. I really don't see much difference. Also, unlike other pistachios I bought before, even after opening the bag for some time, they are still crunchy and taste good. My recommendation to the company is consider using ziplock bag. This way they will stay even fresher. Great product!

review/text: Not much to say. There are some pistachios that haven't been opened up properly, but most of them are just fine. Sometimes you can taste the sweetness (I had no idea they could be sweet). I ran through them pretty quickly- an open bag just vanishes like that. I'll probably buy some more from this seller.

review/summary: A great starting point
review/text: I'll start this review by saying I never usually just dump a pasta sauce on top of noodles and eat it as is.  I usually add mushrooms, tomatoes, garlic, onions, etc. depending on what I'm serving it with.  That being said, I'm reviewing this sauce based on it's original taste and ability to be combined with other ingredients.  This is a pasta sauce and it tastes like pasta sauce.  Although ground beef is the second ingredient listed, I didn't find it to be an obvious flavor.  I like the quantity that comes in each jar, since I usually cook large batches to freeze the left overs.  I think this is a good starting point to add more ingredients to, the flavor tastes just like any other pasta sauce until you kick it up a notch with whatever ingredients you prefer.

review/summary: Regional soda
review/text: Cheerwine is a regional soda from North Carolina, that has expanded into 12 other southeast states in the last 8 years. Started in 1917, Cheerwine was first formulated in the basement of L. D. Peeler's wholesale grocery store. Created during prohibition when it was common to name sodas after liquors. The owner added a new cherry flavor syrup to his previous soda and cheerwine was born. Believe it or his great grandsons still run the company.<br />The bergundy red soft drink has a nice mellow cherry flavor, and the color is really a pretty burgundy color, almost like wine. It is more subtle and seems less sweet on the palate than the grocery store house brands of cherry soda. No aftertaste or bite. It is easy to see why the locals in North Carolina rave about this and the other drink from this company, "Cool Moon".  Also made in diet soda.

review/summary: It works.
review/text: I originally received Bedtime tea as a gift and enjoyed it so much that I ordered it when I couldn't find it locally.  I believe it works primarily because it contains valerian which is also available in capsule form.  Valerian generally doesn't smell very good in a capsule but in this tea with Passion Flower Extract and other organic herbs it tastes great.  Some people report vivid dreams with valerian but that's not necessarily bad.  I don't have any morning grogginess and valerian is not associated with bizarre behaviors while asleep (eating, driving, etc) as some prescription sleep aids do.  As a rotating shift worker I have to be alert for either a day or night shift.  This helps me sleep when I need to and awake well rested.  I will definately order it again.

review/summary: Yummy baby food!
review/text: I was advised by my pediatrician to start feeding my baby cereal to get him accustomed to the taste and texture of food.  Hubby and I excitedly went out and got for him "G___" rice cereal.  My poor baby was making faces while eating his rice cereal but was a pretty good sport and still swallowed.  I was fed Cerelac as a baby and I decided that my baby should try some too.  He was smiling and laughing while I was feeding him Cerelac.  He obviously enjoyed his dinner. :-)  My only concern is that the 4 pack cans expire on 10/12 and I don't know if my baby will be able to eat everything by then, since he's also taking breast milk.  I wish the cans will have a later expiration date.  Next time, I will just stick to the single cans.  Although pricier, I will be sure there won't be any waste.

It is manufactured in Spain.  Tastes just as good as I remember it and is very nutritious.  My daughter loves it too.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Great stuff.
review/text: Well,<br /><br />This is the stuff I ate from the time I was 6 months old, and I'm sort of surprised that this has not been reviewed yet. It tastes great and my little  8 months old is starting to love it.<br />My only concern is that I'm not sure that the FDA tests this product, since it is imported. Bottom line is if is good enought for me, it probably is for my daughter.

review/summary: Was a Little Worried, but it's Great!
review/text: I was a little worried when I unpacked this coffee and noticed the "Extra Bold" on the box.  However, this coffee is very smooth, with no bitter taste to it...and it is also not weak like some breakfast blend coffees can be.  This coffee is for my wife, who doesn't like some of the bolder coffee's I drink. (Timothy's Parisian Nights, Coffee People Black Tiger, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, Starbucks Cafe Verona and Sumatra)  This is more like Caribou Blend or some of the lighter "Donut House" coffees.  I tried a cup and I know it'll be right up her alley.

review/summary: Not as light as expected
review/text: I like a light strength of coffee and this one said it was light. However, it is more of a medium and stronger than I like.  So, I was a little disappointed since the purchase included 2 boxes. I'll use it because it's a little pricey, but I won't order this brand again.

review/summary: Nice - mild blend
review/text: I like my coffee in the mild range - and this fits the bill.  I had been drinking nothing but Green Mountain Breakfast Blend, and while I would say I prefer that variety a little better in terms of taste, these Tully's are very similar.  And given the ridiculous price of most K-cups - Green Mountain included - I will stick with the Tully's for now.  The only thing I didn't really like is that the 50 K-cups were thrown in to the shipping box loosely, with no additional packing material.  Even something like a plastic bag to seal them up inside the shipping box would have been nice.

review/summary: Perfect
review/text: I've been trying all the different flavors of K-cups and this one is my favorite so far.  Good enough to stop looking.  I've only seen it on Amazon, and ordered it in search of a favorite.  Strong enough that it has flavor.  Not so strong so that you think you drank a charred tire.  No extra flavors either like some others.  I'd categorize this as a medium to light roast.  It is a just a little lighter than the Tulley's House blend.

review/text: This coffee rocks!! Not bitter and without that lingering aftertaste. I love the flavor of bold coffee and this one hits it perfectly. Very smooth and delicious. I think the breakfast blend (bold) and the house blend (bold) are basically the same. I have both and taste little differences. Love it!!

review/text: This is the only coffee Mom liked from the sample packs that came with the Keurig Coffee Brewer I gave her for Christmas two years ago.  It is impossible to find in retail stores so I have ordered on line from another source for the past two years.

review/summary: Very nice breakfast blend
review/text: This is one of my favorite K Cup varieties.  It's important to note that the light classification refers to the roast and flavor of the coffee not the strength of the coffee.  This coffee is no weaker than the darker roasts I've purchased, but the flavor is brighter and great for a morning brew.

review/summary: Problem brewing
review/text: I liked the taste of this coffee but there was a problem with some of the K-cups of this brand.  Probably a half-a-dozen of this brand of K-cups did not work properly.  I would put the K-cup in the coffeemaker, close the lid on the Keurig, and press the button of the size cup I wanted to brew and it would brew about 3 Tablespoons of coffee and then stop.  Coffee grounds would be in the cup and I would open the Keurig and close the lid and try again and it just would not brew.  I tried another K-cup of this same brand and it did the same thing.  Finally I just put in a Timothy's brand K-cup and it worked just fine.  This kept happening using the Tully's K-cup- so far I've wasted six of them.  Some of them worked just fine.  It might have just been a fluke with this box of Tully's K-cups but I probably will not order this kind again.  The K-cups are too expensive to waste 1/4 of them.

review/text: The K-cup system is very convenient and the Tully's cups make an especially rich and smooth cafe-style coffee.  You can actually use the Tully's K-cups twice because the coffee is nice and strong.  The only problem with these and any k-cup is the price (around $.50~.60 per cup).  Buying in bulk on Amazon does save a few cents a cup.

review/summary: Grounded Out!
review/text: I have purchased K-Cups of Tully's Coffee previously but not the Breakfast Blend. For some reason almost all of the K-Cups in this Pack of 2 purchase I made have had grounds coming out in my coffee mug! I notice that when the cups are pierced the seal is not tight enough to prevent an opening at the rim, thus the fine coffee dust and also some grounds are escaping. Not very happy with this so I am not sure I will buy any more of this particular brand.

review/text: This was supposed to contain 50 Tully's Breakfast Blend K-Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers.  Instead there were only 38 K-Cups, 4 of which were Green Mountain Half-Caff and one of the Tully's K-Cups was busted open.  I've ordered K-Cups through Amazon many times in the past with no issue.  This is by far the absolute worst experience I've ever had with them and makes me question whether or not I'll purchase any more from them.

But yesterday I tried a cup around 3pm and it tasted like I was licking a clown's elbow.<br /><br />I'm assuming y'all will recommend noon as a safe cutoff, but I'd really like to incorporate BB into my post lunch rotation.  How late can I enjoy a cup without it feeling like I'm drinking a bucket of sand?<br /><br />Thanks.

review/summary: Excellent tea
review/text: I love Ahmad teas and this one is one of my favorites.  The leaves went through minimum processing, which is evident from a very small amount of tea dust at a bottom of a container.  The bigger pieces mean that more of tea's essential oils are preserved contributing to more aromatic taste and superior flavor.  A freshly brewed cup of this tea is balanced and smooth and has a pleasant aftertaste.  It is good in the morning as a wake-me-up and it is equally good as an Afternoon Tea pick-me-up.  It is good on its own or with dessert.  I highly recommend it.
