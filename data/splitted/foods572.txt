review/summary: Simply delicious!  I can't believe it!
review/text: I've tried to like prunes before.  I love dried fruit and prunes have a certain reputation.  These prunes and gooey, and sweet and actually delicious.  Good prunes apparently have a delicious and complicated flavor, are slightly tangy and sweet.  I was just sitting down to eat a couple, and I ate five!  I hope nothing terrible happens!  I imagine if you like prunes, you will love these and if you WANT to like prunes... well... you will love these!

review/summary: The best organic prunes!
review/text: Wow!!! I just purchased a single pouch of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET5Y52">Newman's Own Organics California Prunes, Pitted, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a> at my neighborhood Publix super market, spending a pretty penny but wanting to try them first before I ordered a pack of 6 at Amazon... and I am sold!!! These are the very best organic prunes I've ever eaten!!!<br /><br />Newman's Own are not only organic, they are soft, moist, juicy and melt in the mouth with natural sweetness. Lovely!<br /><br />What's more, they are an incredible value here at Amazon Subscribe and Save. I will keep well stocked up from now on, thanks once again to Amazon.

review/summary: Organic dried prunes! Not all organic!!!
review/text: I just went through my 4th bag. Make sure theses all organic prunes as it states here. No preservatives. I had 2 bags that said under Ingredients: prunes, potassium sorbate as a preservative. I can't have potassium sorbate and that is why I purchase these. Be careful on what you will receive in the mail. I would check all bags under INGREDIENTS: Organic prunes and NOT Prunes, Potassium as a preservative. You will see the difference in the prunes as the organic prunes are more mushy and the postasium sorbate are intact and not mushy. If you ever had dried prunes that are preserved you will notice the difference in textured.

review/summary: Really good fat and moist prunes
review/text: I try to purchase only organic dried fruit to avoid pesticide residue and sulphites and decided to try these Newman's prunes.  I think they are great!  They are really plump and moist and delicious to "eat out of hand" or to use any other way you use prunes.<br /><br />My husband thinks he doesn't like prunes so I mix them with dates, nuts, cacao powder, a little almond butter or tahini, vanilla and a bit of agave in my food processor and make no bake/no flour "chocolate brownies" which he absolutely loves.  You can also add just a bit of water and grind the prunes into a paste to use as a replacement for half of the oil in chocolate cake or cookies. I'm happy to munch on the prunes right out of the package.  I think you will be also.<br /><br />Oh yes - Amazon's price is much lower than our local grocery store or even the food club I belong to!

review/summary: It works and it taste great!
review/text: I like the taste of prunes.  They are sweet and tangy at the same time. Newman's prunes are a noticeably different from Sun Maid prunes.  Sun Main prunes are moist and soft.  Newman's prunes are dried fruit that is less moist, less sweet, a little chewy.  They are more like a typical dried fruit in texture.  I like both Sun Maid prunes and Newman's prunes, and it is nice to have a variety.<br /><br />When I had problem with regularity I started including 4-5 prunes as part of my breakfast and it worked like magic! Now I eat them just because I like the taste.<br />I eat prunes right out of the bag, a few a day. For a special treat I like them with a small piece of dark chocolate.  Those two flavors are incredible together. I would have loved to have more than a few prunes a day but the "side effects" train you to take just the right amount, if you indulge too  much you'll be spending more time in the bathroom!<br /><br />I became curious to learn how prunes work to produce the gentle laxitive effect.  Here is what I learned:<br /><br />The dietary fiber (think of fiber as millions of tiny water attracting particles) mixes with the stool. Each fiber particle soaks up available liquid, and enlarges into a minute gel bead. These particles give the stool size shape and moisture, making it easy for the colon to move along easily.<br /><br />To work properly two other circumstances must also be right; adequate water for absorption, and adequate lubrication of the colon lining. Humans require 8-10 (8 or 10 ounce) large glasses of water daily. Water can be any liquid, whether it is tea, coffee, milk, fruit juices, soft drinks, or other beverages that agree with you. Milk products may be particularly gassy, due to the fermentation of milk sugar, i.e., lactose, in the colon.<br /><br />In order to lubricate the passage, the colon manufactures mucous. If the colon is dry, i.e., one has too little mucous, or drinks too little water, the stool will be hard and dry and will stick to the colon requiring that one strain to eliminate.<br /><br />How do prunes and prune juice work?  Prune juice supplies simple sugars that help draw fluids to the intestines. This helps to soften the stools, generate lubricating mucous,  and facilitates bowel movements.<br /><br />I like the flavor and the fact it makes me regular. I recommend adding prunes to your daily ritual.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Best Prunes Out There! Organic + Always Moist + Great Price
review/text: I love Newman's Own's prunes.  They're organic, which is important especially if you like to eat large quantities of prunes or habitually over a long period of time.<br /><br />In addition, these prunes are *consistently moist*.  Not in the "so moist, they're mushy and they've broken apart in the bag, so it feels like I am trying to eat very sweet mushpoo" -- no, these prunes are all intact, beautifully pruney wholes that are simply moist.  I've tried other organic prunes - Whole Foods, Trader Joe's - and they've always been too dry/too hard.  But Newman's Own always comes through.<br /><br />Best prunes ever.

review/text: Since we use a great amount of prunes, Newman's Own� Organics Organic California Prunes, Pitted, 12-Ounce Unit (Pack of 6), are excellent for us. I can't find six 12-ounce single packs anywhere for the price I pay for the six-pack here. We just started on our second six-pack and so far have only found one pit. Which is excellent; the brand I used to buy wasn't pitted very well and I had to be very careful of my teeth. This is definitely a good deal for us especially, when I add something else to my order which brings it to the amount that qualifies for free shipping.

review/summary: what -- hard and dry?  no way!!  MOIST and DELICIOUS!!!!
review/text: These prunes are extraordinary.  I see a reviewer says they're hard and dry, but that's not been my experience at all.  I'm on my fourth case of these precious little gems and have greatly loved them.  True confessions:  if you keep them for a while after the pack is opened, they DO get a bit hard and dry -- but they NEVER are when you first open them.  And frankly, usually they're gone before they have a chance to harden up.  I find the ziploc bags a great idea but a little awkward in practice, as the moist gooey prunes are a little sticky and the stickiness from the bag tends to wear off onto my fingers as I dig in for another -- so I just transfer them into a small lock-n-lock container just barely large enough for a whole bag, and then pick each prune right off the top with ease as I work my way through the whole bag's worth.  These are so good, I actually have an extra container full for travel, so that they're easily at hand on trips.  Great snacks, great go-to when you want something sweet and can easily make yourself settle for one of these delights.  Try them -- you may be surprised at how totally wonderful they are!

review/summary: Prune goo
review/text: I love prunes for their anti-oxidant and laxative properties. I especially appreciate them when I am traveling and have less control over what I eat. Last time I ordered Newman's Own organic prunes, they were a nice, chewy consistency and easy to eat. This time, while they still taste great, they are prune mush. As others have said, it is impossible to tell where one begins and the next one ends. In addition, when I remove my hand from the bag, my hand is a sticky, gooey mess. The packaging indicates they are using a new process. I don't find it to be an improvement.

They are sweet; moist and delicious... and of course organic as well.  The 12 ounce pouch is the perfect size container and has a resealable zipper.  When purchased from Amazon by subscription, the price is less than at the supermarket and free delivery to your front door is fantastic.

Lying on his deathbed with images of his life flickering before his fading vision...The Hustler, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Butch Cassidy, numerous salad dressings...I like to think he gave a final goodbye to the prunes before the clammy fingers of fate smothered him in the eternal dark moment of death's sweet release.  Paul Newman suffered to bring the prunes to us and ultimately paid the ultimate price for it; a price far greater than the list price of $29.40 + shipping, and he did it with dignity.

review/summary: Slimey prunes
review/text: We are a prune loving family. I buy several pounds of organic prunes each month. I'd never tried Newman's Own, but didn't really think I could go wrong with organic prunes and the price is great. I was WRONG!! I opened the first package and went to grab by first prune. Immediately, I noticed a difference. These are mushy, slimey and sticky. Not at all the consistancy of dried fruit! I like dried fruit because it's easy to eat on the go, pack into lunches or grab as a snack. This isn't possible with these because they are too messy. I ended up putting them into my food dehydrator to try and finish the drying process. This makes the great price much less great if I have to add in the time and expense of drying them myself. I have canceled my Subscribe & Save and will go back to the ones I usually get at the health food store.

review/text: They are sweet and nice, but I was disappointed that they didn't still have the pits in them.  It did not have on the package information that they were pitted.  I'd like to find a good source of organic prunes with the pits still in them.  I like to suck on the pits for hours.  It's a good way not to chew gum.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: We like these a lot.  Once in awhile a few will be a little hard and not as plump as we prefer in the bag, and it gets worse the longer they are refrigerated.  But, they taste excellent and for the most part they are large and very moist and not hard at all.  And, they are organic so we are not exposing ourselves to harmful pesticides, they are more nutrient dense than non-organic, and they are better for the earth because of the better farming practices.

review/summary: I like them, they don't
review/text: I was so sure these would be a hit, that I subscribed to them.<br /><br />Con: Unfortunately, my picky eaters did not like them because they were TOO moist.  They are messy to eat, and do not contain as much fiber per serving as some other brands.<br /><br />Pro: I still like them, and will have to finish the carton myself - over a period of weeks, of course.  The pouches keep them fresher than those cardboard containers some other brands use.  Still a good price vs. supermarket, and merchant delivered very fast.

review/summary: Paul Newman Squished Prunes from Amazon
review/text: Up to the point of buying Paul Newman's prunes I was very happy with his products. I had been buying Del Monte prunes. I like the Del Monte, but Paul's were "organic," so I thought I would try them even though they are about twice the cost. When I received them they were in a "zip-lock" style bag very similar to the Del Monte. The big difference is Paul's are vacuum packed so it seems. No air in the package at all. The prunes were all mashed together in one big blob. When I tried to separated the prunes with a fork they kind of came apart. What a mess. I would never buy these again, and I certainly would not recommend them. I'm going back to Del Monte.

review/summary: I've purchased this several times, because it's GREAT!
review/text: The strawberry banana flavor of this individually packaged drink mix is really out-of-this-world! It's as good as the far more expensive bottled drinks. The packaging is ultra-convenient, and saves me the hassle of carrying in cans of diet soda. Besides, who really needs the carbonation?<br /><br />Now, as for the "hunger satisfaction" part -- I can't believe it, but it really does seem to work. Now, it is true that if I drank plain water before a meal, it would also kill my hunger. However, the taste of this stuff is so great that it really does satisfy my craving for something sweet. So, if this is "science," "magic," or my will to believe in the power of Crystal Light -- I don't know. But, the bottom line is that this is a great product that I've already purchased several times, and will continue to buy.

review/summary: Hunger Satisfaction, YES! Great Taste, YES!
review/text: Finally! A hunger satisfaction product that actually works and tastes great, too. One of my main problems when I am on a diet is that I am constantly hungry. I've tried so many other products that claim to reduce hunger, yet I don't notice any real effects. However, this Crystal Light product does reduce my hunger pangs and enables me to go longer between meals. The instructions indicate the powder should be mixed with a 16.9 ounce bottle of water, but I find the flavor a bit strong, so I usually mix it with a 20 ounce bottle. The strawberry-banana flavor is very fruity and I can't discern any chemical or artificial aftertaste. I take this with me on trips, it's great for avoiding the temptations of airport fast food. I also mix it into liquid diet meals for a boost of fiber. It doesn't blend particularly well with anything other than water, so I use a blender for this. Even with water, you have to shake the bottle vigorously, but it does blend well with vigorous shaking. All in all, this has really helped me to be more successful on my diet.

It keeps hunger at bay for at least 24 hours and it works best with a 20 oz. bottle and if you empty some of the water out first so it will dissolve better, and you must shake it well. Now, that I know this is at both Walmarts' near my house again I will purchase it there.

review/text: I really like this product; it truly "tides me over in the afternoon when I get really hungary, and keeps me from eating candy or some other thing that is not nutritious.  The only negative thing I have to say is that I wish there were other flavors, like maybe lemonade, cherry, etc.  I think the strawberry bananna is ok except that I don't like banannas so I mix a little lemon with it and that takes the bananna flavor away.  Thanks for making this great product.

review/summary: Harder to dissolve than other Crystal Lights
review/text: I'm a regular buyer of Crystal Light flavor packets, as it's the only way I drink water! Crystal Light makes amazing options, and I'm a fan of almost all that I've tried.<br /><br />This particular one has a fantastic taste, though I find it VERY difficult to mix into water. At first I put one packet into 20oz, and was left with lumps of powder within the drink. Now I've been putting half a packet into my 20oz, and it's still pretty hard to dissolve it all. I'm not sure if it's because this one has extra ingredients due to the "hunger satisfaction" part and that's why this is more difficult, but it's enough of a hassle for me to just pick another type of Crystal Light drink mix. I like to use my same reusable cup all day, and only usually clean it out every night. When using this type, I have to clean in between each glass in order to eliminate the powder buildup.<br /><br />As far as the 'hunger satisfaction' goes, I got this more for the flavor than that aspect. I wouldn't say it 'satisfies' hunger, but it can help you if you've got some time before your next meal.

If you aren't too concerned about serious hunger satisfaction from a drink, I recommend these as a 'change-up' from your normal water additive.

review/summary: Ok, but not great...
review/text: I bought this thinking it was a strawberry/banana version of the small Crystal Light on the go packets with 10 calories per packet.  I was a bit disappointed when I got them and they have 30 calories and 3x as much powder as the normal CL on the go packets.  If you are using a new bottle of water, you have to pour some water out to make room for the mix.  It also took about an hour for the powder to dissolve in the water.  It settled at the bottom of my bottle and would not mix no matter how hard I shook it.  I found that if you pour it in and place the bottle in the fridge for about an hour then go back to it, the water will have penetrated these clumps enough to mix in with some heavy shaking.  It is nearly impossible to mix in initially.  This is not a big deal for me, I will just place it mixed in my fridge overnight, but for anyone thinking they can just take a packet to work with them and mix it in at lunch will be disappointed, you will need a separate glass and spoon to mix immediately as you poor it into the water.  Now for the taste...It has a decent flavor when you first take a drink, but the after taste is not good.  I'll stick with my orange or raspberry lemonade CL on the go packs.

review/text: I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS">Starbucks Frappuccino</a>, but I don't get to drink it too often since it's a bit on a heavy side for a casual coffee-based drink IMHO. illy issimo cappuccino is a much lighter alternative to Farappuccino: it has half the calories (100 vs. 200) and fat (1.5 g vs. 3 g), albeit in a slightly smaller serving size. The lightness, of course, comes at a price and illy issimo cappuccino tastes as light as you would have expected it. It is made of medium-brew coffee, which is not that bad, but I prefer more full flavored varieties. This is a fairly tasty coffee-based energy drink, but it's not as impressive as illy issimo's espresso drinks. Nonetheless, I've enjoyed drinking it and would recommend it to most coffee lovers in a search of a convenient and tasty energy drink.

review/text: Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids. To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.

The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.<br /><br />While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job.

And if the complaining persists, gerber may stop making it all together and babies who love this product will suffer! Gerber, don't stop making these!

review/summary: Yucky Vegetable Smoothie Add-in
review/text: Gerber changed the recipe for the worse, this version isn't new and improved. It's worse I think because of the addition of the tuna oil/DHA. When the weather cools down I'll hide this in soups and stews as a mystery ingredient. Even the dog won't eat it :(

review/summary: My baby eats it all!
review/text: I bought These green beans for my baby because they're organic. I honestly expected him to reject them, that it would be a good photo op for funny faces. He didn't flinch and in fact ate the whole thing! This was much to my surprise! Maybe it was a fluke, he was really hungry that day. On a different day, he ate the whole container once again! I'm thrilled that this is another green option in his diet since he doesn't seem crazy about peas. I will be buying more of these.

There is tuna oil included in the ingredient list which is how the DHA is added.

review/text: I am not happy with Gerber at all.  I researched their products and they do not have to list ingredients if below a certain percentage.  (LIKE IF GREEN BEANS WERE MADE ON A CONVEYER OF WHERE RICE WAS MADE AND THE RICE WAS UNDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT TRACED THEY DO NOT LIST IT ON THE INGREDIENTS).  The beans I did not know have fish oil in it.  It is now listed on the product ingredients.

review/summary: Gourmet Popcorn
review/text: My father-in-law recently introduced me to this delicious popcorn, and I highly recommend it to others. He purchased a couple bags of the tiny kernels in Northern Indiana Amish country earlier this summer. The popcorn is light and can easily be distinguished from store-bought microwave popcorn. Yoder's popcorn does not contain any artificial ingredients or preservatives and would make a great gift.

review/summary: Too Pricey To Be Disappointing
review/text: I love popcorn but don't have it very often, so when I do I want great popcorn. As odd as it may sound, I have worked at it over the years to get it "right." I'm satisfied with my process and usually use Orville's, but recently found that I love the popcorn at Sundance Theaters. Sometimes I stop in their lobby just to pick up a bag of popcorn to take home for supper. I learned the trick of adding a touch of coconut oil to the popping oil and now I'm on a hunt for the best popping corn. I bought this even though to me the product and shipping cost was steep. I thought that if we bonded---me and the popping corn---it would be worth it. Well, it arrived poorly packed but intact. No matter, I made a batch of popcorn that night and settled in to watch "Leverage." The popcorn was tasteless. Made the same way as always, it was completely tasteless. I actually threw it out, which is so unlike me. I threw out the batch and I threw out the entire bag of popping corn. I've been an Amazon.com user since its inception and I think this is only my second poor review. If the popcorn and shipping cost wasn't so pricey it would be a small matter. I just don't want someone else to overextend themselves like I did in a purchase and have such a bad experience. I may be some kind of popcorn elitist, so let me just say that if you have gourmet tastes when it comes to popcorn and a slender pocketbook, don't take a chance on this brand unless you can try a smaller amount, closer to home.

review/summary: Great active toy
review/text: The Jolly Ball toss and tug can be played with by one dog, or in my case ,as a tug toy for two.This was a replacement purchase, as the previous ball finally split after over a year of being outside and well used.My dogs are fairly large (60 lbs )and have a blast running and tugging. The ball comes in two sizes, 6" and 8".  The 6" is the size of a softball and the 8" is about as large as a bowling ball. I have both. The larger one is the favorite. The balls are hollow ,squishy, not too heavy, and the rope is the sturdiest I've seen. I highly reccomend this toy for it's durability and versitility, as it can be tossed, rolled, tugged and chewed.

I am looking for a replacement rope for it now as it is the most loved toy in the house.  My two Aussies can't get enough of tugging and tossing this toy, I just hope I can fix it!

review/summary: Fresh product, great price
review/text: This extremely large bag of organic dry milk powder was a great purchase.  You can't find it anywhere else at this price ($140 and shipping was free through prime).  The cheapest I found it elsewhere was $180 plus shipping.  It came earlier than expected (2 weeks instead of 3-6 weeks) and in perfect condition.  The powder is free-flowing and fresh, which is more than I can say for the smaller bags of the same brand that I purchased in the store.  The price per ounce compared to the small bags is wonderful, too.  It's almost half as much when you buy it in bulk, which is why I bought such a big bag.<br /><br />The biggest issue I can see is that most people don't need 25 pounds of powdered milk at one time; I certainly don't. I bought it to use in preparing some ready-to-use, "make-ahead", homemade bread and cake mixes (found in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0762426020">Make-A-Mix</a> cookbook, which is very nice), but still I don't need that much at one time.  So what I did was to vacuum seal 10 cups at a time with my food saver and store it in the refrigerator for when I need it. I ended up with exactly 85 cups of milk powder when measured properly--scooped in the measuring cup and then leveled with the back of a knife. I have a feeling it will last me a *very* long time--lol. Since it's vacuum-sealed, I hope that it will stay nice and dry and fresh. This would be a great purchase for someone who owns an organic bakery or has a very large family and a lot of storage space in the fridge or freezer.<br /><br />From what I understand, this product is best used for cooking and baking rather than making milk to drink. That's because it's not an "instant" non-fat dry milk powder; therefore, it's being said (in reviews of the same product in a smaller package) that it doesn't dissolve very quickly in water.  I think it can be used for drinking in a pinch, though, and OV does say that it can be used that way.  I hope I never need to find out, as I prefer fresh whole milk for drinking and making ice cream. My main reason for using it is for baking, so this shouldn't be an issue. Just something to keep in mind for those wanting to use it for making milk for drinking. If you dissolve it in warm filtered water, it should help; you can then put it in the fridge to chill for a while.<br /><br />There are no instructions whatsoever on the packaging, so if you are buying this, you need to have a clear idea of what you're using it for (as I do because of the recipes in the one cookbook).  If using it for making milk, you'll need to know how much to use per cup of water because of the lack of instructions of any kind.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied with this product at the price I paid. Thank you, Amazon!

We have ordered over 40 containers (from Amazon and other online outlets) and the problem persists in just about every order, there will be at least of the containers that is open at the top either due to heat or poor packaging or heat, the top seal seems weak and unable to stand 'shipping and handling'.

review/text: I read about the health  benefits of Japanese green tea.  The neighborhood health food store introduced me to this tea.  I was happy to find Amazon was selling this tea.  I think the tea is smooth tasting.  It is almost like a comfort food to me.  Steeping for 3 minutes really brings out the flavor. I like to put some frothy soy milk into the tea and sit back and relax.  I especially love this tea is offered by subscription. Now I don't have to go to the store, my tea comes to me. I feel I am having something healthful as well as satisfying.  It is a part of my day I look forward to.
