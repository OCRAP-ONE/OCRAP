review/summary: Tastes good.  Subscribed!
review/text: We had tried this while traveling and knew we liked it, notwithstanding other, negative reviews here.  It's literally a matter of taste.<br /><br />A few minutes web research on the Ace-K sweetener mentioned in another review showed that some folks are concerned, but no tests have not shown clear evidence of a health hazard.<br /><br />So, we like it, we're not worried about it, but we could not find it locally, even at groceries that carried other Torani varieties.  Amazon's offer of free shipping and a discount in return for a subscription order met our needs.  Subscribed.<br /><br />The first shipment came in right away and we've been enjoying it since.

review/summary: Great Sugar Free alternatives!!!
review/text: SF English Toffee is my favorite of all the Sugar Free flavors Torani offers.  I have my own coffee bar set up at home and have 10 SF flavors setting out as I speak.  Some are better than others, but I haven't had sugar in 10 years and they are a great tool for sweetening coffee, tea, yogurt, muffins-both before and after baking, and so many more.  For some perspective, I have Type 1 Diabetes and these syrups are the closest thing to real that I can safely have.  Thanks to the company of Torani for working on the flavors and marketing them.  I appreciate it.  When a reviewer says to not waste your time, I wholeheartedly disagree.  Try them.  My family has their own favorites and they are not diabetic.  Sugar Free Salted caramel, SF Vanilla and SF Wild Raspberry are fantastic.  I forgot SF Coconut, really good...

review/summary: Torani Sugar Free Syrups Taste Aweful
review/text: Don't waste your time.  I started using Torani's sugar free stuff to sweeteen my coffee, but I could only last so long.  It has such a terrible after taste, that I would have given up coffee all together if this stuff was the only product I could use.  I still have two bottles that I will never touch again.  Luckily, there are other brands that don't come with unwanted taste effects.  I've been using Stirling, and I'm going to try DaVinci.  Monin syrups always taste good as well.

review/summary: Not very sweet, splenda is minor ingredient
review/text: This "syrup" is not very sweet and despite being labelled "sweetened with splenda" it has a very small amount as splenda is the last ingredient. The primary sweetner is acsulfame potassium which is nowhere as far as i am concerned. As a general rule if any deception in ingredients or labelling the product should be boycotted. Who wants to buy products from companies that want to deceive you into buying an inferior or cheaply made product. They find it easier to put a token amount of splenda so they can put it on the label and you will think better of the product. I only would buy this if there was no alternative available and it was necessary due to blood sugar level control otherwise pass on it. I hate food companies that lie. Even small lies. It is like a famous brand of shortening on the market that says 0 grams of trans fats on the label but in reality it is 100 percent hydrogenated oil which is trans fat. Even though the entire can is only trans fat they made the serving size so small that it contains less than 1 gram of trans fat so they can put contains 0 grams trans fat on the label to cheat their customers by deception.  Torani sugar free syrup would not sell much if they put sweetened with acsulfame potassium on the front of the bottle instead of splenda. Nuff said.

review/summary: Great taste when cold brewed!
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for months now along with the Tazo Zen green tea. I love both flavors and have found that they make a wonderful iced tea (the only way I like to drink tea). I have found that if you cold brew this tea and the Zen green tea, they do have the flavor undertones that the box states. It almost seems to have a "solidness" to the flavor that seems to fit the breakfast concept well. I definitely recommend it if you like a nice smooth flavor to your black tea. I use the Starbucks Classic syrup in this tea and the flavor is perfect together (you can buy classic syrup in a bottle from almost any Starbucks location).<br /><br />Just as a side for those who are interested. Cold brewing just means that you place the tea bags in the fridge in water and let it set, usually at least 3 hours. It's that simple! It maintains the full subtle flavor of the tea much better and is almost impossible to turn bitter or mess it up unless you use too many tea bags. This only works if you plan to have iced tea of course. I use 4 "Awake" tea bags in 2 quarts of water and let it set overnight. I don't remove the tea bags until I have drank all the tea. It's delicious and super easy. I would recommend trying it to anyone who likes iced tea!

review/summary: Tazo Awake
review/text: My husband stopped drinking coffee last fall.  On a trip one of the hotels had Tazo Awake Tea in the room.  He tried a cup and liked it.  When we got home, I priced a box of Tazo at the local market and decided I'd need a part time job to pay for it.  I looked on Amazon and was happy to find it at a great price.  It was shipped quickly and we are very pleased.

review/summary: Strong and yet very smooth.
review/text: I'm a long time tea and coffee drinker. I've bought many pounds of different varieties of teas over the years and have settled on various black teas as my favorite. However I was blown away by how smooth this tea is for its strength. This is a bold tea, very dark, leaves dark stains on the inside of your cups, but it tastes so much better than most Irish and English breakfast teas that I've had over the years. I've normally had a little stomach upset with many of the loose leaf teas I buy, but I can drink several mugs of this stuff and it has no affect on my stomach at all. Thanks Tazo and keep up the good work.

I used to drink plain Lipton tea, or Republic of Tea "Ginger Peach". Once in a while, I'd go to Starbucks and pay $2.50 for a tazo awake tea. Buing the tea online is so much more affordable!

review/summary: An Excellent "Basic" Tea...
review/text: If you are looking for an excellent basic tea - one without exotic flavors - then Tazo Awake Black Tea is for you!<br /><br />I have been a tea drinker since childhood, but several years ago noticed that grocery store teas - Lipton and Tetley - did not seem as good as in former years.  Further, I found I was getting queasy after drinking those teas.  It seemed I would have to forego my afternoon cup of tea.  Then my husband brought home several Tazo Awake tea bags; they had been a complimentary offering in one of the hotels in which he stayed.  Tazo Awake was wonderful - it tasted just as I remembered tea tasting in earlier years.  Additionally, it didn't upset my stomach; that was a real plus!<br /><br />Tazo Awake Black Tea is an outstanding choice for anyone looking for an excellent basic tea.  I particularly like it with cream and sweetner, but find it just as good without those additions.<br /><br />Amazon is the only source from which I buy Tazo Awake Black Tea.  The price beats anything else I've found and delivery - even with Super Saver shipping - is quick.  I had my tea on Monday, and I had ordered it on Friday.  Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: TOO strong black tea for my taste
review/text: I'm a black tea lover, I usually brew leaf teas. I like Darjeeling and Ceylon teas and I'm not much of an Assam fan, but can like it in moderation. That said, I don't understand the fascination with Tazo teas. I've tried some of their bagged green teas and they were too flavored and one could hardly taste the "green" part of the tea. This black tea on the other hand is so strong that if properly brewed it completely kills my taste buds. Sometimes one wants bagged teas to quickly make oneself a cup, but not at such taste disadvantage. I ended up babysitting these tea bags and pulling them out early, but it's not quite it and the convenience factor is out of the window. This tea is understandably still an upgrade on Lipton and Tetley bagged black teas.

The chicken is shredded, but each shredded piece is about 3 inches long and they are bundled and packed pretty dense.  I may try cutting the pieces further or blending to see if I can get her to eat it more enthusiastically.

review/text: I wonder how many post office workers considered this to be something other than Nettle :)<br />Very pungent smell before even openining the package and when it was opened I was suprised to see two small pillow size bags of neetle. Very good quality and I ended up just putting in about a tablespoon for the oversized cup of tea..let it sit for a few mintutes to settle and strained off just a bit on the stuff that wouldn't sink...tastes great and delivery was just a few days..it actually arrived the same time my amazon prime packaged arrived...great product, great service and although it was be a while before I order more I will come back to this place...

review/summary: Best Juice for kids!!
review/text: I really think this is the best juice for kids. It tastes WAY less sweet that regular kids juice, even juices with an equal amount of sugar. It has lots of vitamins! It's the ONLY juice my kids drink! When they get apple juice at other kid's houses they think it's too sweet.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5, is price and availability. When I started buy the juice it was everywhere, grocery store, Target,etc. Now I can only find it in one store and at Amazon. It is also pretty expensive especially because it's the only juice my kids drink and I have 3 kids!!

review/summary: Our #1 juice product
review/text: I started buying this product for my daughter when she was just over one year old. She has always loved this apple-carrot flavor and she prefers it to all other types of sugary juices, even now at 2 1/2 years old. Its nice that it is organic, BPA-free, and low in sugar. It also has extra calcium and is high in vitamins A and C.<br /><br />We buy the sippy bottles and refill them from this larger bottle. The sippy bottles are dish-washable and don't leak, so they're perfect for the diaper bag.<br /><br />First Juice is a great product. My daughter really loves it, and I feel good giving it to her.

review/summary: Best juice for toddlers
review/text: I waited a long time before introducing juice to my toddler, on my pediatrician's and pediatric dentist's recommendations.  When I finally decided to let him drink something other than milk or water, I read a lot of labels before deciding to try First Juice.  I liked that it was a mix of fruit and veggie juice, and that it was so low in sugar compared to other juices intended for kids.<br /><br />My 19 month-old son loves this juice!  He has tried "Motts for Tots" and a couple of other types of reduced sugar juice for kids while at friends' houses, and he didn't like them in comparison.  There are four flavors of First Juice, and I think his favorite is the banana-carrot.  He also really likes the small sippy bottles the juice comes in.  We usually buy the 32-ounce bottles and refill our sippy bottles.  They wash easily in the dishwasher, and last a long time.  When one gets crushed or finally springs a link, we toss it in the recycle bin and buy another one to replace it.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RBTMLE">First Juice Blueberry-purple Carrot, 8 Ounce Sippy Top Bottle (Pack of 12)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RBTMLE">First Juice Blueberry-purple Carrot, 8 Ounce Sippy Top Bottle (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Sumptiously delicious!
review/text: I have searched high and low to find a high-quality sugar free, dairy free chocolate bar that tasted just like the real thing, and I can honestly say that these amazing chocolate bars fit the bill perfectly!  Ross Chocolates has truly done it--I could not tell the difference between these and the kind made with sugar and dairy.  These dark chocolate bars are perfect for anyone looking for a pure, healthy alternative to the standard sugar-laden chocolate bar out there.  I am hypoglycemic, so normal sugary candy isn't an option for me.  These bars, though, have no impact on my blood sugar--in fact, I feel even better after eating them and have no negative reactions whatsoever!  They are also perfect for people who are allergic to dairy (like myself) because they are completely dairy-free.  As an added bonus, each bar contains 3 grams of fiber!  The bars have a wonderul, fresh crunch to them, with none of the strange aftertaste common to some products sweetened with sugar alcohols.  I honestly couldn't tell the difference between these maltitol-sweetened bars and those sweetened by regular sugar.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/summary: Tasty chocolate that's perfectly permissable for low-carb followers
review/text: I don't know, maybe it's because dark chocolate isn't as sweet as regular chocolate anyway, but I found these sugar-free dark chocolate bars absolutely satisfying and delicious.  As someone following the Atkins diet (with considerable success), it's always great to find a successful low-carb, sugar-free version of the foods and snacks formally crossed off the "okay to eat" list.  I'm certainly going to re-order another supply.<br /><br />By the way, although I purchased these bars via Amazon, they were actually shipped directly from CarbSmart, a retailer specializing in low-carb and other restricted-diet foods.  Yes, both the product and the shipping are a little pricey, and the shipping isn't as lightning fast as Amazon's well-oiled operation, but those are quibbles when considering that I can again happily eat candy- and good candy, too- at the movies again!

But I was NOT willing to give up my chocolate, thank you! In doing research for a book I'm writing, I had become a bit of a "chocolate snob." Valrhona. Guittard. Amedei. Lundt. But Ross Chocolate? Never had heard of it before going totally sugar-free. But these dark-chock bars just ROCK. They melt well in the microwave, as well as in your mouth. They save me from being desperate when I crave my favorite treat. No digestive upset, no stalling effect in my weight loss, either. I'll be ordering again: Thanks, Ross!

review/text: When it comes to chocolate I'm an expert and I have tasted all kinds from many places and for the true chocolate lover this is a very good one for being sugar free. This is a really nice treat that is good by its self or with a nice drink of coffee or tea to aid in melting it in ones mouth... I suggest that you request it be shipped 2 day and on ice if ordered in the spring, summer and fall as this is chocolate and it melts easy. It will still taste good but for the full enjoyment the normal presentation is best and how a food that is eaten for pleasure should be... I love this product and will buy many times more in the future... Thanks so much, I do apreciate the care that has been taken in making this wonderful product.

review/text: In trying to eat a low-carb diet, I have tried all of this brand's chocolate bars. Of those offered the dark chocolate are definitely the best. The maltitol flavoring is certainly not as good as a normal chocolate bar, but considering it's low carb value it's not bad. The dark chocolate is naturally less sweet, and I am guessing that means it gets less of the artificial sweetener in this bar. Either way, if you like dark chocolate and need to avoid the sugar, this is a passable bar which tastes OK. I was much less enthusiastic about the other flavors (almond and coconut).

If  you are looking for something low in carbs this is a great choice.  If you are not on a low carb diet, please note that these bars have 12 grams of fat each.

When I found these chocolate bars,(which taste great to me!) I wrongly believed I had finally found the chocolates that wouldn't feed my Candida. I was wrong because Maltitol does feed Candida. I found out that XYLITOL is the **only** sweetener that does not feed the yeast. Fortunately, I managed to find delicious dark chocolate bars sweetened with Xylitol on the Internet and I am going to stick to those. Being that Xylitol is so healthy, why isn't it used on more products? Unfortunately, many of us already know the answer. :(

For the price I was expecting a bit of a "gourmet" taste, a chocolate with a smooth, creamy melt.  This chocolate tasted a bit gritty and was neither smooth nor creamy.<br /><br />What I did like was that the vendor enclosed a chemical pack with the shipment that kept the chocolate cool enough despite the summer heat.  This chemical pack prevented the chocolate from arriving in a brown, mushy package.

review/summary: This company sells lousy tea!
review/text: Alvita  Nettle tea is lousy. It does not taste good. The tea bags have very little tea in them. Some of the tea bags were open and the contents spilled into the outer packaging. I will stick with another brand of Nettle tea. First they sent Parsley tea and I had to send that back. Don't waste your time or your money on this product.

review/summary: dissapointed!
review/text: if i just would have taken the time to look a little more on Amazon, i found this SAME product, 30 bags instead of 24, for only $6.00 with free shipping- SAME THING FOR LESS.  i plan to cancel my subscription and order from the other vendor.  I think in this time of economic hardship that EVERY vendor should really take a look at what is out there and try to be as comparable as they can for everyone!  i am very disappointed in this. I would only consider to keep my subscription if the price was reduced!

review/summary: Too Organic
review/text: I placed an order in October 25th 2011, and received in the next week. The products were supposed to be good by February 2012.  Knowing this is organic product, I did not have problem with that. It tasted great. Good portion for little kids. However, I just found out some of the cartons started leaking and grew mold (and it is still mid January!). It must be packaging issue. I have seen the same company having packing issues with baby jar food. I am very sorry that we wasted about the half of what we have gotten because we really liked them! We will have to pick different ones next time.

review/summary: Great organic juice, but box leaks
review/text: First off, this is a great product if you are looking for an organic apple juice. My toddler loves the taste, and so do I.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the boxes in my order were leaking. I counted 10 of 44. I thought they might have been damaged during shipment. Upon further inspection I noticed the bottom of the boxes were saturated with juice. I guess it's a manufacturer's flaw because none of the boxes had holes in them. Maybe a seal problem?<br /><br />Anyway, I reported issue to Amazon.com and they reimbursed me for the 10 damaged juice boxes.<br /><br />Like I said, this is a great product. I just won't order this juice in bulk. I'll stick to buying smaller quantities at the super market.

In any case, they are much better than high sugar, high fructose juices, but if you can go for Vruit - go for it!

review/text: I ordered this box of apple juice for my daughter's first birthday party.  We were inviting lots of little kids (5 and under), and thought that these juice boxes will reduce potential mess.  We were right, no spills!  The juice tastes great - not too sweet or too sour.  The size is perfect for 3-5 year olds.  For adults, of course the 4 oz is just one sip.  I did not actually give my 1-y old any.  We also took leftover boxes on a trip.  Easy to carry and not heavy.

The nice thing was that I felt I could get a wholesome breakfast on the run.  Also, some days I could only eat half a container and was full.  The rest went into the frig for the next day (maybe why sometimes it seemed mushy).  Maybe all they need is smaller containers.

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE these
review/text: There are several things I like about this product, including that these are naturally shed antlers that are collected, cleaned, packaged and then sold without involving killing to get them.  Somebody goes out and collects these and that is probably part of why they are fairly expensive, even on-line...I first found these in our local pet store...but forget about the retail price, (IF you can even find them,) the price at the pet store was twice what I found on-line, and the antlers were not nearly as large.  None of the big chain pet stores carry these, at least not in my area so far. I ordered these through Amazon and was amazed and delighted that they arrived literally the next day.<br /><br />That said, my dogs simply ADORE these things.<br />They keep my new, and very young 100# rescue lab busy literally for hours, but do not "slime" my floors or carpet, (or our bed or couch.)  He loves to set one on my desk as an "offering," which I actually don't mind since they are VERY clean compared to all the more traditional bones, hoofs and chews.<br /><br />Additionally, they double as a great "fetch" toy in the yard.<br /><br />Essentially my guys just chew them down to the nubbin's, but without any damage to my stuff. Highly recommend if you want a clean chew/toy that will keep your dog busy for hours without wrecking the party, and helps with tarter build-up on their teeth in the process.<br /><br />Really a great idea, and a great product.

review/summary: Good . . . and over priced
review/text: My dogs like these.  Everything the positive reviews say about them is true . . . they're a really good option because they don't splinter easily and it takes a good while for my pack of sniveling, snarling, white hot balls of canine terror (wiener dogs) to wear them down.  They eventually get small enough that they become choking hazards and you have to toss them.<br /><br />I have no hesitation in highly recommending deer antlers as a chew for dogs.  It's only that after first buying this brand, I then ran across real, honest to goodness deer antlers that were comparable to these in every way at a local pet store for almost exactly half the price of these.  If you can't find real antlers locally or online for a better price, these are absolutely fine.  But do look around first.

review/summary: Excellent purchase, and much bigger than expected
review/text: After reading the reviews about how some customers received an antler piece that was too small, I was concerned that the same thing would happen to me and purchased a medium sized chew for my Japanese Chin.  When I received the chew, I was surprised to see how big the antler piece was! My dog definitely loves the chew toy; she sniffs at it, and tries to chew on the end.  However, it's much too heavy and long for her to carry around happily, and she will inevitably give up on the chew.  I will be giving this chew to my friend's dog, who is a Destroyer of Toys (bit the nose off a rubber squeaky pig) to see how she likes it.  I have already ordered a small sized chew for my dog.<br /><br />I guess my only complaint is that the size estimate is really too vague.  4-6 inches for the medium?  Well 6 inches is 50% more than 4 inches.  I'd like to see the sizes more exact.

This is one of his absolute favorite chew things (other than that blue monkey which ended up in the garbage).  I love this product because I do not worry about him choking or if it is okay for him to be eating plastic.

review/text: This was thin, unlike the last xtra large that I ordered from this supplier.  I think it will still work for the dog to chew, at least until is shrinks 2 inches or so.  Since my dog is a mastiff, I'm afraid that he'd try to swallow the thing whole if it gets too much smaller, due to its thin diameter.  So far, he hasn't shown much interest in chewing it.  I think  he likes the taste of the elk and moose antlers better.

review/summary: THE BEST CHEW ON THE MARKET
review/text: I adore this chew.  Two years ago I gave up chewing tobacco, the wife and the doc teamed up on me and finally convinced me it was time to stop playing chew Russian roulette.  It was tough to quit, I'd been chewing since I was eleven and half.  The idea was, give up the chew first and then tackle the cigarettes.  Well I'm happy to announce that last July with the help of hypnosis, the Patch, and plenty of nicotine gum, I am a non smoker!  Now watch, I'll get hit by buy a bus :) I'm just joshing.  Sure I put on a few pounds, a hundred and thirteen to be exact.  My shrink said I had an oral fixation and suggested a number of remedies, rebirthing, joggin, getting my jaw wired shut, tummy tucks, fake cigarettes, you know just something to stick in my kisser, hell I tried the works, but nothing seemed to do the trick.  Until accidently I stumbled upon these Antler Chews.  I had bought a couple for my dog "Swiderski," and one night while he was enjoying one at my feet, I was having myself a plate of ribs watching the Braves game.  And you know me, all thumbs, I dropped a rib to the floor.  Well I reached down real quick to grab it and accidently picked up Swiderski's antler.  And Lawdy lawd I tell you what, I was home.  These are TAAAASSSSSTY, I'll never buy a pack of beef jerky again.  I've dropped eighty eight pounds to date, and I don't go anywhere without my new chew.  I keep one in the glove box of my truck, and I've got em in every room in the house. Hell I've fallen asleep sucking these chews.  I know it's somewhat of a cliche but they do taste a little like chicken, and I stress, they are not overwhelming.  I couldn't tell you how many packs of smokes I'd go through when I'd get to drinking my beer, but now I can go a good three or four months with just one antler.  Whew baby!  For any of you out there with an oral fixation or those who just wanna drop a few pounds, these deer antlers'll do the trick. My compliments to the chef.  God does work in mysterious ways.

Rawhide chews are not bought by us anymore, and we're saving money even after buying these.  Do the math.

review/summary: FINALLY something that my girls can't chew through in minutes!
review/text: We have two dogs that are just over one year old (a Yorkie and a Pomeranian.)  And boy do they like to chew.  When they were puppies we could get away with the conventional chew toys, but as the girls got older, their chewing muscles got stronger.  They now destroy any plastic chew toy in minutes.  Eventually we found bully sticks, which are wonderful distractions for those evenings when the girls have more energy than I do, but the sticks would still only last about 60 minutes.  And then we met the deer antlers...PERFECT! The girls love to chew on them and the antlers last and last and last.  The antlers arrived and were approximately 6 inches long.  I didn't have much hope of them lasting since they seemed kind of small and the girls really went to town chewing on them.  But for weeks now the girls have chewed on the antlers and there is still barely any gone.  Oh deer antlers...where have you been all my life?  :-)

review/text: Tillie loves her deer antler! She goes kind of "crazy". She just chews and bites and chews -- keeps her busy for quite some time. The antler doesn't split or break in pieces.  It's great!

review/summary: Solid
review/text: I am a huge fan of antlers.  I was recently in Florida visiting my wife's Aunt.  They have a dog and only seemed to have interactive toys.  I had one of these sent to their house and their dog loves it.  As do mine

review/text: Don't bother with these....dogs go through them so fast! I have a small boxer that chewed an entire antler in 1.5 hours and the darn thing cost $20!
