review/text: I love the coffee from Coffee Bean Direct.  BUT the price is about $10 more here than if you order directly from the company.  AND if you order 25lb all or several flavors you do not have to pay shipping.  I get together with friends and we place a combined order once a year.  Great coffee and Great selection, as well as tea.

review/text: I have to confess I am a Lazy Cook.  One of THE laziest cooks in history, I would guess.  I suppose my lack of enthusiasm for cooking comes from the fact that the effort in making any dish is soon demolished as the receipe involved is devoured either by other hungry people, or one's self.  Nothing remains for all that work and effort!  John Fiedler, (I think), once told Julia Child that cooking and music are similar, in that after the effort is expended, the work soon disappears.  But Mr. Fiedler, (or perhaps John Williams -- or whoever else said this), was wrong.  Because music can be RECORDED -- and listened to over and over again.  Sadly, the same cannot be said for food.  You can make it over and over...but the effort involved is always the same.  Food cannot be "recorded", then "played back" in an instant.  Unless, I guess, you make a lot and freeze some of it.  But when the frozen portion is gone -- you've got to make the receipe all over again.<br /><br />Yes -- I AM a lazy cook.  A very, very, very, VERY lazy cook.  To me, making a tuna salad is an effort.  (Forget about anything more complicated to make!)  However, I will ALWAYS make the effort to make a tuna sandwhich, and take my own home-made "liquid refresment" with me, (ice tea, lemonade, iced coffee, etc.) -- "brown-bagging" whenever possible, to save a few pennies, which, day after day, and year after year, DO add up!<br /><br />Yes, even I will make tea.  With tea bags, (or even with lose tea), it is very, (VERY!) simple to make, after all!  (Even simpler than intant coffee....because, to make GOOD tea, the water should come just to boiling, whereas in instant coffee, the longer the water boils, the more tasty the instant coffee will be.<br /><br />Therefore, even I see absolutely NO reason to buy bottled tea!  OK -- maybe once, so that you can use the empty bottle(s) into which to pour your own, "home-made" tea, after the bottles are empty. All that is required is to rinse out the glass bottles, (IMMEDIATELY!) a few times, with very hot water, or put dish-detergent soap into the glass bottles, fill with water, leave overnight, and THEN rinse with very hot water.  Or put the empty glass bottles in the dishwasher to get them clean.  Not very hard -- even very lazy me can do these things.<br /><br />But, I suppose if you are going to get some bottles to put your tea in, you might as well get HONEST TEA COMMUNITY GREEN TEA, offered here on Amazon in a 12-bottle pack.  This tea is rated the No. 1 tea in one of a very famous series of diet -- or make that, non-diet -- books, (you know, the ones with all the pretty pictures in them).  Anyway, the authors of this book are very, er -- authoritative -- being editor-in-chief, and food and nutrition editors of some very well known, and famous, men's and women's health magazines.  HONEST TEA COMMUNITY GREEN TEA gets their highest marks.  I also note that there is a nice wide mouth and screw cap on this bottle -- easy for refilling and opening and closing, (keep a sterilized funnel handy, if needed).  This green tea has maltese oranges in it, (to sweeten the flavour and add to the health benefits), and is certified kosher by the Orthodox Union, and certified organic by the USDA.  It tastes pretty good for a green tea -- and the anti-oxidents in green tea have been proven to increase metabolism, and do other good things.  If you still don't like the taste of green tea, you can, (after finishing this product), COMBINE green tea with other tea, (orange pekoe, English Breakfast, jasmine, etc.), for a better taste.  More cheaply -- with your own brewed tea from bags or lose-leaves.<br /><br />HONEST TEA COMMUNITY GREEN TEA comes in a 16 ounce bottle.  If you have a thermos of this size, (or larger), you might want to use it instead -- but this way, you will have many, (that is, 12!), eventually-empty bottles, and perhaps thus be able to fill, (and refrigerate), several at a time, thus saving yourself some extra work.  (There's "Lazy-Cook" me again!)<br /><br />To your health -- and your saving money, making for more leisure, now and in the future!  : )

review/text: These are tasty. they're not like home made so don't expect that.  they're the top of the line for canned pasta. and it only takes 90 seconds to heat the whole can (once you dump contents into microwave safe container). they are plump with meat- so they are BIG BEEF_ the meat mix is creamy but the sauce has meat chunks in it- like regular pasta sauce might if the meatballs break up in it. the cans came with 1 1/2 years till expiration date- so if you order extra you don't have to eat them all right away- so if they're on sale_ buy, buy, buy. good source of protien, veggies and fiber- i read the label. if you eat the whole can it's about 500 calories- but you're filled up and it's good.

review/text: I bought this to keep at work. I didn't want to spend $10 on lunch every day so this sounded like a good idea at the time. I've tried this both on the stove and by microwave but the results have been pretty bad. To clarify, it's not that it tastes bad, but it doesn't taste good either. The sodium intake is sky high so at the very least it could tasty delicious like all the other food that's not good for you. It's so bland that I started drenching it in hotsauce and even hot cheetos.<br /><br />I guess it's back to ramen noodles until there is a cheap and tolerable food that doesn't take 10 years off my life.

review/summary: Exceeded my expectations
review/text: I was a barista for 15 years and sold excellent coffee while living in San Francisco.  I love coffee. When I developed gastrointestinal issues coffee became something I couldn't drink without suffering immensely.  I began a search for coffee I could drink.  I bought a Toddy system which removes 70% of the acid and will still use that method, but it isn't always convenient and a pound of coffee doesn't go as far with that system in my experience.  A friend brought me some low-acid beans and I enjoyed waking up in the morning and grinding beans for a fresh cup. It still gave me heartburn but was easier on me than regular coffee, somewhat.  But I SO enjoyed making fresh coffee again, so I searched for a low-acid coffee when my little stash ran out, and that's when I found Puroast.  I have never bought ground coffee, always whole bean, so had very low expectations on all counts.  But that's how desperate I was to have fresh coffee, I figured it's worth a try.  This coffee really is low acid and I can enjoy a cup or two each morning.  I don't feel as if I'm drinking an inferior coffee and I LOVE that it's organic, free trade.  I loved Peet's french roast, so if Peet's is a 10 then this coffee is a 7 or 8, which I think is incredible for a low-acid coffee and not even a dark french.  This is coffee I don't have to apologize for when sharing it with friends.  I am ordering more.

While the spout does leave much to be desired, getting  the wax off the crock was a pain. What I'd recommend (if you really love this oil like I do) is buy the crock, get the wax off (you can melt the final bits with a flame to get it nice and clean), and then buy these drums as refills for the crock. Best of both worlds!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product! I'd make it 4.5 stars because of the drum, but since that's not an option, I have to round it up to 5.

review/summary: Love the oil. The drum? Not so much
review/text: L'Olivier makes a lovely, fruity olive oil.  I've used it (whenever I could find it) for years.  This drum 2-pack is a great value, for the volume and quality of the olive oil.  The drum looks handsome on the counter, too, but is terrible for dispensing the oil.  The pull-out spot on the top is too short to keep the oil from dribbling across the top and down the side of the drum.  Buy it for the oil, but decant into another container.

review/summary: Love this oil
review/text: I've bought L'Olivier before when I could find it, & Amazon's price is great. I think French olive oil, even though extra virgin, has a light taste that's excellent to use when you don't want to change the taste of your food, almost like regular "light olive oil", but richer & with the health benefits of EVOO.<br /><br />I did have trouble with the pull-up pour spout coming out the second time I used it. No big deal, just transferred the oil to another container.

review/text: this very fragrant olive oil adds depth to recipes and melds especially well with the summer bounty of tomatoes and basil.  It is also great with any Mediterrean, Provencal, or Italian recipes.  Althought a bit pricey, its flavor and versatility make it worth the cost for cooking with quality ingredients.  It is  probably my favorite olive oil.

review/summary: 13 flavors, nice sampler, long use by dates, great for K-cup starter
review/text: Most coffee drinkers want caffeine...I am one of those rare people that LOVES coffee (especially dark and bold), but just doesn't need the caffeine at all. Finding decaf K-cups is a challenge, so I was happy to receive this as a gift for xmas 2011. I also posted a picture of the sampler. There are 13 flavors included in this 20 decaf coffee sampler:<br /><br />2 - Green Mountain French Vanilla<br />2 - Green Mountain Breakfast Blend<br />2 - Green Mountain Extra Bold Dark Magic<br />2 - Tully's House Blend<br />2 - Tully's French Roast<br />2 - Emeril's Jazzed Up<br />2 - Caribou Caribou Blend<br />1 - Green Mountain Vermont Country Blend<br />1 - Green Mountain Hazelnut<br />1 - Coffee People Donut Shop Decaf<br />1 - Donut House Decaf<br />1 - Newman's Own Special Decaf<br />1 - Timothy's Hazelnut<br /><br />Very happy that all packages specifically say decaf since these will likely get mixed in with hubby's cafs in our K-cup drawer!<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a good sampler. The packaging was nice for a gift...with 4 recipes printed inside the box (although they didn't correlate with the coffees in the box). I would have preferred a little less duplication...how about 20 different coffees!? We are just starting out with a Keurig, so wanted to try samplers first. I bet that almost every box that goes out is different. So, I'd likely buy again (and hope that there is a Wolfgang Puck in the mix). Would have liked to see a hot cocoa in the box, just for variety (like the tea samplers often have cider).<br /><br />Also important to note, the use by dates on the pagkages range from 5/12 to 9/12!<br /><br />No comments on taste just yet since we are new to the K-cup world and because coffee flavor is based so much on personal preference.<br /><br />4 stars for nice packaging, decent variety, and long use by dates. Would give 5 stars for 20 different coffees!!

The packaging also makes for a nice gift presentation. Highly recommend.

I started buying the Etouffee by the case when it was in a can that included the liquid. Now its a dry mix but it still provides a flavor second to none. Of course if you want it to have a hot bite, just add some Chachere Creole Seasoning. And I only serve this over rice out of my rice cooker.

Great flavor, they rehydrate quickly and add tremendous depth and zest to recipes. So quick, I love them.

I highly recommend for soups, vegetable dishes, stews, just about anything.

review/summary: Very Flavorful....
review/text: I have used a pretty good size line of Barry Farms dehydrated veggies for more than a decade now.  Although I occasionally have used them when cooking in my kitchen, the vast majority of time I use them for campfire cooking when I am hiking.  I love carrying dried products such as this on my hikes for they are light, easy to carry, and you can just use what you want and reseal the bag.  (Unlike canned veggies and such that don't take kindly to being bagged and toted along as leftovers).  Best of all, these tomato flakes are very flavorful.  Make that downright delicious.  I add about a third of one bag to any stew or soup I am making on an open fire, and the rich taste of fresh tomato is your reward in every spoonful. A little of these flakes goes a long ways as to flavor, so keep that in mind if your a beginner with them.  They have a much fresher taste than you would imagine, and have been a part of some of the best meals I have ever put together in the wilderness.  My only recommendation when ordering these flakes is to get at least 3 bags at once to make the shipping worth it.  You can order 3 of them for the same shipping cost as one.  Really rich tasting and well worth your money in my opinion...

It is still not the best drink, but it keeps me fairly energized and I do not dislike it any longer.

Now Im not 100% sure its the tea but you have to look at your body like a computer, whenever something seems wrong with it, then go back and figure out what have you taken or stopped taking and problem solved. the taste is not horrible. I mainly drink one pack before working out for energy and it delivers without the jitters.

review/summary: Crawfish:Cajun Boiled
review/text: I haven't had crawfish in 11 years and wanted some of my family to try them. They all agreed that while they stink in the kitchen, they taste much better than they smell and have an earthy and slightly shrimpy flavor to them. They also tend to have a shrimp like texture in the tail. I found about 4 bad or slightly decaying crawfish in this package....which is EXCELLENT for crawfish. Especially considering that you can EASILY get a bad one in a restaurant without the cooks realizing that it was less than KOSHER. In all, I had several dozen in this 3 pound order and can say that out of roughly 40 crawfish, only 4 or 5 were less than appetizing. You can generally tell by the odor and color of the flesh once cooked. I used a cajun seafood boil from Zatterans to flazor mine. I just boil about 1/2 gallon of water with 1-1/2 cups of their seasoning. Once boiling is under way, drop in crawfish and let boil about 7 minutes....then shut of heat and allow to rest about another 3 minutes to absorb more spice. Excellent spice that was just meant for these. Overall, I found these crawfish to be a very reasonable buy and well shipped for the price. If you don't live where crawfish are easily bought at low prices....then this place is were to go for these!

I then show them how we pour it - I like to use a Primo Latte Frother, and have found that International Delight sugar free creamer works best.  Pour creamer in the cup, add any Splenda or sugar desired, and then froth it with the latte frother.  Pour the coffee after that.  It makes a cup of coffee that I think is better than any Starbucks you can get!

review/summary: Works but tastes disgusting
review/text: The review for this product alone is going to be short: it is effective, but tastes awful and bitter.  I ordered this product to focus on studying, etc but I found that "get charged" is just as effective plus wakes me up a bit more and tastes a whole lot better.  If you are considering "get smart", I would strongly suggest trying "get charged" first.  I have inserted my review for "get charged" below so you can see why...<br /><br />"'Get charged' works wonders and tastes amazing, even without sugar, whether hot or cold. I ordered a cup of this on a whim while working on application essays for grad school. I figured (especially being caffeine free) that it would just be a gimmick and that I'd just move onto a latte afterward. Well...I never needed the latte. This woke me up and made me focus better than anything I have ever tried before. Now instead of taking my ADHD meds, which work but give me migraines, I usually just grab a cup of this instead. I'm about to finish up my first can and will definitely be purchasing another one. Whether looking for energy, focus, or both, this tea absolutely delivers! I cannot recommend it enough.<br />***Word of caution*** One cup is plenty to get you going; a little goes a LONG way. Two cups in a row made me a little jittery, dizzy, and gave me stomach pain."

review/text: I love this stuff! I sprinkle some into the bottom of a cup I am about to brew green tea in, add a green tea teabag, sprinkle in a little stevia, add hot water, and enjoy! The green tea extract kicks up the green tea a notch or two (making the tea flavor more intense) and the stevia counteracts any bitterness making it nicely sweet without any calories ... just don't add too much, a little goes a long way (true both for the extract and the stevia).

review/summary: Our Toddler Loves These
review/text: I'm no "health nut", but my wife and I both figure our toddler doesn't need to be consuming large amounts of refined sugar yet, so we are very thankful that he loves these Kashi crackers. He can snack on them for a long time if allowed because they taste great. In fact, so can I, yet as best I can tell they don't have anything in them except good wholesome stuff. He screams sometimes when we take them away. If you're looking for a genuinely health snack food for your child, we highly recommend these.

review/summary: Excellent Coffee
review/text: So I had my first taste of Jamaica blue mountain coffee today and can honestly say it's the best, most smooth cup of coffee i've had. The smell when you first open the bag is divine, when you grind down the beans it only gets better. I use a Bruville single cup coffee maker to make my coffee so i'm not exactly sure if it would taste different with a drip coffee maker, i'll have to use one and then update this review. Not only can you smell the difference from your run of the mill coffee but you can see the difference as well,a dark rich looking cup but not overbearing or bitter just really smooth. The only thing about buying this bag from Amazon is that your paying close to 20$ more than you should. I got the same bag from coffeeforless.com for 54$ and free shipping.

review/text: First a little background on me. I Am a coffee drinking fiend. I probably keep several countries coffee production up, so I know coffee. I don't mind strong coffee or so so tasting coffee I just dont expect it to be expensive so so tasting coffee. I have had and love Jamaican Blue mountain coffee before but it was a lot more expensive than this. This came in a cute little burlap sack (you get some style points there) but after that it's pretty much down hill. The coffe is not the normal rich tasting wonderfull smelling JBM I have had before, it just tastes like every other coffee albeit at an extravagent price. I have ordered some more Blue mountain from another supplier will have to see how that goes. This is one that will not get any repeat business from me. There are plenty of other better tasting coffees out there at a lower price.

review/text: I got turned on to this coffee when I was in Jamaica.  I decided to order a bag.  It is a very high quality coffee, very very smooth and not bitter at all.  Like any coffee, the type of sugar and cream you use can make or break it.  I don't drink it black....judge me not.  With a little turbinado sugar and very little cream, it's great.  However, it isn't the strongest coffee so too much cream or sugar will ruin it.<br /><br />The price is a little steep and I probably won't be ordering again, at least not for awhile.  It is good coffee, but for my money I'll get less expensive beans that are a little less high quality.

review/summary: Another New Orleans Treat
review/text: This is an excellent coffee that is very similar to Cafe Du Monde but it is much more available. I can find this at my local grocery store whereas I have to order Cafe Du Monde through Amazon. (Which I do on occasion)<br /><br />I find Cafe Du Monde just a tad bit smoother and a little "earthy", but that said this is still top notch, and has notes of caramel.<br /><br />Remember as with all coffee with chicory to use less then you would normal coffee, perhaps half of what you normally would. Using less you will still get a dark coffee as it is almost impossible to get a light coffee with this. That being said, it still contains less caffeine as normal coffee and is certainly less bitter and taste less acidic.<br /><br />Try this today if you are like me and love a good, bold, robust, great tasting coffee with chicory. You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Simply the best
review/text: I am passionate about good coffee, and I've traveled around the world and been fortunate to taste the coffees of many lands. There are great coffees in Italy, Kenya, Ethiopia, Colombia, and many other countries, but in the USA there is no finer coffee than French Market Coffee & Chicory. I've been drinking this for over 40 years and it is a staple in my home. It never disappoints, and I always get unsolicited rave reviews from guests about the coffee I brew.<br /><br />There are a couple of things you should know. Even though this is a blend of coffee & chicory, it makes a robust pot of coffee. Pay attention to the advice that's printed on the lid of every can: "Use 1/3 to 1/2 as much coffee as you would normally use to brew a pot." My standard recipe these days is 2 level scoops per 8 cups of water for an automatic drip brewer, but if your coffee maker will take 10 or 12 cups of water, I'd still recommend using just 2 level scoops; then adjust to your own taste.<br /><br />You get great value from a can of French Market coffee. The can is 16 oz., not 12 oz. like many other cans on your grocer's shelf. And by using only 2 level scoops per pot, that can will last for weeks.<br /><br />The company that makes French Market coffee was acquired by another New Orleans-based company, but I trust that they will respect the heritage and tradition of this great New Orleans brand. Try French Market coffee and see if you agree with me that it's simply the best.

review/text: We love French Market Coffee and are thrilled we can order it from Amazon.  During the years we lived in New Orleans we got hooked on this coffee after having it at Galatoire's and Commander's Palace, two of our favorite five star restaurants in New Orleans.  It is the only coffee these two fine restaurants will serve.  We couldn't believe our luck that it was also available in New Orleans' grocery stores.  But now that we no longer live in New Orleans we have more trouble finding it.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  This coffee is in a league of it's own.  Rich, flavorful, full bodied and smooth like the finest European coffees.  Once you taste it, regular American coffee tastes like bitter, colored water.  I can't imagine a morning without my French Market coffee!

review/summary: My favorite!
review/text: I've been hooked on French Market coffee ever since a trip to New Orleans in 1980.  The last few years I've been buying directly from the company online because it's very expensive to buy retail here in Seattle (yes, I like it MUCH better than Starbuck's). I prefer the medium-dark roast, both the Creole Roast (red can) and the Restaurant blend (white can); the two are indistinguishable to me. I don't know how to describe it other than it has a very strong, deep flavor, but is mellow, not bitter, which may be the chicory. I practically never grind beans anymore because I like the chicory component and the coffee stays very fresh in the can anyway. I really do use ~50% less coffee to make a pot, as they recommend, and that, plus buying in bulk, makes my coffee habit extremely affordable. I was happy to see I could get on a subscription buying plan through Amazon.com; hopefully,I'll be less likely to run out. Now, I just have to find a good coffee maker to replace my old Starbuck's Barista that has finally quit.

The blend is strong, but not burnt or charred like some other "dark" roasts. There is no bitterness to it at all. I fill my coffeemaker carafe to the 6-cup line, and I used only one rounded scoop of coffee instead of two, as per reviewer recommendations. Still every bit as strong as I'd like! I would describe the flavor as "spicy", but not overwhelmingly so. Just enough that you know there's a little something extra in it.<br /><br />Overall a great blend and value. Definitely would order from Amazon in the future.

review/summary: THE BEST COFFEE EVER
review/text: I have been using this French Market coffee for many years. On moving to Guam, it was not in the stores here. I had brought some with me and sent some out when I went to the mainland last year.How thrilled I was to find I could order it through Amazon at a reasonable price and on automatic shipment! This coffee is never bitter due to the chicory in it and is robust and very tasty. I won't use anything else!

review/summary: Good coffee ... especially when you read the directions!
review/text: This is a delicious alternative to regular coffee.  It has less caffeine and seems to be a bit easier on my achy joints.  It brews smooth, rich and dark because of the chicory root.<br /><br />There is no need to add additional coffee, as a one-star reviewer claimed.  The directions instruct you to use fewer scoops of French Market chicory coffee than you would normally use for a pot of normal coffee.  I use a french press (32 oz size), and two heaping tablespoons are enough to make a bold, smooth, and delicious brew with 5-7 minutes of steeping.

review/summary: Too strong for me!
review/text: I love bold coffee but for some reason I did not like this coffee. I got the medium to dark roast and its still very very strong. Also, the taste didn't appeal to me, maybe its the chicory. If this is the first time you going to get this I recommend sampling this at your local store before ordering it online. I got 3 cans with subscribe and save!! just finished one and I am not sure what to do with the other two.

review/summary: Excellent coffee - brings back memories of Bangalore
review/text: French Market is one of the best Chicory blended coffee that I have tasted in the US - really love the thick strong crema/decoction is makes.<br /><br />Anyone who has visited/grew up in South India - specifically Chennai/Madras and Bangalore - you would noticed that these are the 2 cities in India where coffee is a staple drink.  While the rest of India drinks Tea - these two cities swear by their coffee.<br /><br />Drop by at one of the Darshinis (Fast food restaurants) and they make super strong coffee - mixed with Milk and sugar.  The specialty of this coffee is the right blend of Coffee and Chicory which was popularized by the British when they were ruling India.  Most of the restaurants/coffee houses prepare the crema/decoction made with coffee in a 5 liter stainless steel container - then when a coffee order comes through they mix the thick crema/decoction with milk and sugar and serve it in a small stainless steel cup with an inverted bowl - it is a unique experience in itself !<br /><br />Chicory is cheaper than coffee and different 'blends' offer different proportion - typically it is 70-80% coffee and 20-30% chicory.  The best restaurants and coffee house make the right mix of coffee/chicory depending on the coffee type - it is an art.  Until the advent of 'Coffee Day' and 'Barista' chain of modern cafe - the old Bangalore coffee was coffee/chicory blends.<br /><br />Until I came to the US, I had never tasted 100% coffee - I love 100% coffee at Starbucks/Dunkin Donuts.  But once in a way, I get my memories back with French Market Coffee and enjoy it - it does have the right blend of Coffee and Chicory and amazingly rich and flavorful.<br /><br />Here are a few tips on how you prepare a good cup of coffee with the French Market Chicory blended coffee:<br />  * Use only 50-75% of this coffee/chicory blend as compared to using 100% coffee powder<br />  * Preferably add 2% or whole milk to the resulting crema/decoction

review/summary: This one is not good!
review/text: The first time I tried chicory coffee was at a restaurant in Northwest Florida and it was delicious. I purchased some from Community Coffee and it was also very good, impressive, actually including the smell, fresh and aromatic. So, I decided I wanted to to also try Cafe Du Monde and French Market. Well, I was dissappointed with the CDM, but it was still ok, just not as good as Community. However, the French Market was absolutely horrible. The one I had was dark roast. When I opened the can, there was no coffee smell at all which I found very odd. I tried it strong, weak, in-between, and mixed with regular coffee. It was all bad. I would not recommend it. I will stick with Community Coffee.

review/summary: chicory coffe
review/text: French Market chicory coffee is so verrry strong. It must be mixed with other regular coffee(at least 1/2 to 1/2)  I have two cans left and haven't opened yet. Does anyone want to buy them back from me?
