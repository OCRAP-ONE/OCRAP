review/summary: Wife loves the banana bread flavor but it's hard to find.
review/text: My wife loves this banana bread flavor of weight control oatmeal.  It is impossible to find in a non-variety pack.  Our local supermarket used to carry just boxes of weight control banana bread but now it is only available in the weight control variety pack.  Amazon is about the only place I could find just the boxes of only banana bread weight control and I'm not sure how much longer it will be available on here as I heard quaker oats is discontinuing the banana bread only box.  Great oatmeal!

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: I've been eating Quaker Instant Oatmeal for years. I like most of the flavors ( even the plain ) and the banana cream is wonderful but they only sell it in the variety pack. I figured this would taste just as good as the banana cream so I ordered it. That was a mistake. This was terrible ! It had almost no taste and the taste it had was that of a diet after-taste. That's the only way to explain it. It has a chemical and paste taste...if that makes sense. I thought of donating it to my local foodbank but I feel bad giving such a terrible tasting product to a family in need.

review/summary: Artificial sweetener, no returns.
review/text: My biggest problem with Amazon is their return policy, or lack thereof, on unopened grocery items. I ordered the four pack since they can't seem to sell single boxes, and ended up hating this stuff. Now I'm stuck with three new boxes of inedible oatmeal. I couldn't get passed the  artificial sweetener aftertaste.

review/text: I purchaed this cereal some time ago in the grocery store.  I loved it but all stores stopped selling it.  I am so glad it can be purchased through Amazon.  It is so easy to prepare and fabulous.  I eat it every day -- not only for breakfast but sometimes dinner too.  It is so filling and I love the banan taste. Also low calories.  Can't beat that.

review/summary: Delicious Instant oatmeal
review/text: I bought this not because it was a 'weight control' formula but because of the flavor. I love Quaker oatmeal and I love Banana bread so I figured it would be a logical thing to buy. I'm glad I bought this because this oatmeal is delicious. It has a real banana flavor - not a fake banana flavor. And it does remind me of eating homemade banana bread. I love the fact that it's got 7g of protein and 6g of dietary fiber because I'm trying to get more protein and fiber in my diet.

Gotta say, by far the best tasting oatmeal I've ever had so for sure they're my absolute favorite. Keep up the good work amazon and always have these around. Big fan! Bye the way, I also find this to be true for a lot of the other hard to find products out there that I like. When in doubt or can't locate it else where check on amazon.com

review/summary: Mediocre taste, expensive, and label falsely implies product is decaffeinated
review/text: 1) This product is not at all decaffeinated. The "99.7% caffeine free" on the label refers to the percentage of stuff in the container that is not caffeine, rather than a portion of caffeine that has been removed from the cocoa. It is no more meaningful than it would be to write "100% nightshade free" on the container. See the comment thread under Matt's review for more information. 2-star penalty for misleading advertising.<br /><br />2) This cocoa tastes no better than cheaper brands I've tried, and it is more expensive other brands that taste better. 3 stars for taste.<br /><br />3) The fat-free aspect is not very significant, at least not to me. Cocoa powder is roughly 20% fat, but you only need a small amount of cocoa powder to make hot chocolate.<br /><br />4) The metal containers, while nice looking, do not function well. It is difficult to open them without spilling some cocoa.

review/summary: DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING BUT TASTY ENOUGH
review/text: Absolutely deceptive advertising.<br /><br />I use in the AM Equal Exchange Baking Cocoa for my hot cocoa - FANTASTIC, Organic and Fair Trade but I can only drink it in the AM.<br /><br />So I tried this. 6 oz container (not 8 or larger) and the powder is so light it can fly away - probably due to removing fat albeit .5G per serving - not a lot.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is decent with a little stevia and hot liquid of your choice. BUT, because it is so light it requires double to have reasonable amount of flavor.<br /><br />It HAS NOT kept me awake at all though, so in the very least for me it is decaf - beyond that, this product is mediocre.

review/summary: NOT decaffeinated
review/text: This may or may not be a tasty cocoa powder, but is not decaffeinated and it is not free of caffeine.  The product is simply cocoa powder, the same thing you get if you buy Hershey's or any other brand of unsweetened cocoa.  The label states that the powder is "99.7% caffeine free."  This is true because -- you guessed it -- cocoa powder naturally consists of 0.3% caffeine.  This is not comparable to statements that (for instance) decaffeinated coffee is 97% caffeine free, which means that 97% of the original caffeine content has been removed.<br /><br />If you make a cup of hot chocolate from this powder, using one tablespoon per 8 ounces of milk, the caffeine content will be reasonably low -- approximately 15 milligrams -- but perceptible to someone who is very sensitive to caffeine.  If you make what we might call the Angelina's cocoa recipe (about 80 grams of cocoa), you will have 240 milligrams of caffeine, about the equivalent of a "tall" Starbucks coffee.  Do not buy this powder (as I unfortunately did) thinking that you can make your favorite brownies, truffles, or even hot chocolate with any less caffeine than those recipes would have if you made them from another standard unsweetened cocoa powder.<br /><br />Rated 1 star for deceptive advertising.

review/text: For the most part when I was reading reviews over these corn chips, most of them were very positive. This is very obvious as soon as you get them. 1st off, the corn chips are in a see through bag which didn't have much info on the bag. This is awesome because they are so simple by listing the few ingredients in them, and when I ate my 1st chip, I had to eat the entire bag!! These were the absolute best corn chips I have ever had. These beat some chips that I have eaten at authentic Mexican restaurants and I would recommend them again. Also, I didn't find the price to be overly high at all. All I wish is that these came in bigger bags because I know they wont last long.

review/text: How can the manufacturers, whoever they are, be so proud of this product when it is teeming with MONSANTO'S GMO's corn and soy?  These foods are unlabeled and untested, harm the environment and cause food allergies, among other things.  They could use organic and feel proud and not add to the guinea pig food experiment going on in this country with these GMO's.<br />GO ORGANIC OR DON'T SHOW UP IN MY KITCHEN!!  The Hari Krishnas should be ashamed of themselves!

review/summary: CHOCK FULL OF MONSANTO GMO's
review/text: I try NOT to eat GMO foods, which are genetically modified organisms.  They were created by Monsanto and other companies to withstand huge amounts of their pesticides.  These foods are unlabeled, untested, and dangerous.  They are harmful to the environment and are causing Superweeds all over the world which now are so huge they break farm implements and require massive doses of other more dangerous pesticides in addition to the Monsanto Round Up. I called the Hava Corn Chips company and they did verify that since their products are not organic that they may very well contain these GMO's, which, by the way can cause food allergies and also have caused sterility in lab animals.  THEY ARE UNTESTED.  I do NOT recommend eating corn and soy which is not organic-it's almost all GMO.  Read your labels, don't eat these!!!  Shame on the Hari Krishnas!  For a few pennies more they could sell organic products.

review/summary: Braswell Pear Preserves
review/text: I live in Massachusetts but I'm originally from the South. Usually, when I go home, I buy several jars of Braswell Pear Preserves but haven't been home for a while. I can't find them here and the company who makes them is in Georgia. It seems to only be distributed in the Southern part of the U.S.<br />I have been craving Pear Preserves and when I saw them on Amazon, I had to have them, no matter what the cost. Yes, they are expensive but worth every spoonful.<br />I recommend them to all Pear lovers.

I ordered this product 3 times.  Returned the first two.  I'll keep this third order.  This darker yellow hard candy is no better than the $7 bucks for 7 lbs hard candy; no reason to pay $55

review/summary: Smells like the plastic bottle it's packaged in
review/text: The first thing I noticed was an almost chemical-like smell upon opening the bottle.  It did NOT smell like spices.  I had my sister take a whiff for a second opinion and she said it smelled like chemicals from the hair salon.  Not a good start.  Perhaps the cheap plastic bottle it's packaged in was affecting the smell?  Despite the scent, I tried the curry powder. There's definitely a kick from the Red chiles which are the first listed ingredient.  Other than that, the overall taste is just odd.  It does not taste like any curry powder I've ever had, hot or otherwise.  The ingredients listed on the label are: Red Chiles, Coriander, Yellow Mustard, Fenugreek, Tumeric, and Cayenne.  (At the time I'm writing this review, the ingredients were not listed on the product page.)<br /><br />One more small oddity.  Although the label is in English, there must have been a translation somewhere along the way because it includes these instructions: "Curry powder must be heated up, in a little butter before use."  Huh?<br /><br />If you want good, quality Curry Powder this sadly isn't it.

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I have an espresso machine at home and I make my own lattes with it.  I've been trying to find a replacement caramel ever since Starbucks stopped selling theirs.  I tried this brand and it is NOT close to Starbucks style caramel.  I know they don't try to be the same as Starbucks so I cannot ding them on that.  Monin flavored caramel sauce is very runny and thin.  It is fine for adding caramel flavor, but it won't stay on top of the foam in a latte.  It tastes fine, but doesn't have as much of that rich buttery taste that the Starbucks caramel has.  The closest I've come to that is Target's Archer Farms caramel sauce.  I've also come really close with Torani's original caramel sauce.  This sauce is great for an iced coffee blended drink where all you care about is flavor.  If you're looking for presentation, as in a caramel macchiato then go elsewhere.

review/summary: A great caramel sauce
review/text: Was looking for caramel sauce to re-create my favorite coffee shop's caramel macchiatos. I made the mistake of trying the Smucker's brand caramel syrup which dilutes almost instantly in the coffee. The Monin brand however, does not and stays thick and adds a great flavor to any drink.<br /><br />This is worth the money and each comes in their own squeeze bottle which keeps clean up and ease of use nice and simple.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I was a little hesitant ordering the 6 pack - wondering if I should have spent less and just got a sauce from the store.<br /><br />This is a perfect sauce.  After using Redi Whip on my hot chocolate or cocoa, I drizzle the sauce over top and it it wonderful.  You can also use it before the whip cream.  I used to like marshmallows but whip cream and caramel sauce is decadent and a whole lot cheaper than going out and buying it.<br /><br />I am very happy with the purchase and it had a really good expiration date - not that they will last that long.

review/summary: Sweet and Delicious
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Licorice Spice Caffeine Free Herbal Tea has a the sweet flavor licorice teas are known for, along with several nice spices that complement the licorice in a lovely, more-subtle-than-chai way. Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Neon color plant
review/text: I ordered this on June 14, 2012 and it arrived four days later on June 18.  It came in a four inch plastic container, packaged with foam peanuts.<br /><br />My plant is more leafy or lush than the one pictured on the internet.  My plant has about 34 leaves of varying sizes.  It is bushy or very full for its container so I was able to divide this plant.<br /><br />This is the first time I have seen a plant with this unusual coloring so I am pleased to have this new color which is kind of yellow and green.  The new leaves are yellow green with yellow being the primary color, while the older leaves appear to be light green yellow, with a light green being the primary color.<br /><br />This fine and healthy plant is a new one to add to your collection.

review/text: My dogs love this dog food. They seem to prefer the souffle style wet foods that don't have a lot of chunkiness. This is one of those products. They also love the Cesar brand bacon and eggs souffle style dog food that comes with the pink lid. Great product. Arrives in a nice plastic case that has indentations to insert each of the dog food trays. Makes storing in the cabinet really simple.

review/text: I gave this five stars because I've never known a dog who won't "gobble" these Cesar foods.  Yet, my Vet scolded me ("Misty's getting chubby) and says this food is sinfully rich (& fattening).  He put her on a "healthy diet" and she's not very happy.  Feeling sorry for her, I mix a small portion of the Cesar with her 'healthy' dry food.  She normally finds the Cesar, and leaves most of the dry food.  If you've got a skinny dog, with a picky appetite, this is for you!

review/text: I have a basenji dog that is a bit "picky" and will not eat some dog foods (I have tried several of the "premium" and "super-premium" dog foods.<br /><br />He loves several of the Cesar Canine Cuisine foods and this is one of his favorites.  There is never any hesitation when I put his food down, he digs right in and consumes it almost instantly.<br /><br />There have been no GI upsets with this food - his stools are completely normal.  Traveling with him is easy with this food because it doesn't require refrigeration and no mixing - although I do give him dry food to "snack on" at will, he usually eats only a small amount of this and only when he has been very active.<br /><br />He gets two packages a day, one in the morning, one in the evening so a pack of 24 lasts 12 days.

review/summary: The most perfect sunscreen ever
review/text: This sunscreen is great.  I have sensitive skin and need to wear sunscreen daily because of my acne regimen.  I use Alba Hawaiian SPF 30+ on my face every day underneath makeup, and I absolutely love it.  It has a light, non-greasy, almost whipped texture, which absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any residue.  It has never irritated my skin, clogged my pores, or made me break out.  The scent is a mild green tea/floral fragrance; it doesn't smell at all like typical sunscreen.  Additionally, I love its high SPF rating (30), when so many facial sunscreens only give you SPF 15 or 20.  Best of all, Alba doesn't test on animals, and this product contains no animal ingredients.<br /><br />A few months ago, my tube of Alba Hawaiian ran out.  Wanting to see what else was out there, I tried another natural sunscreen (Aubrey Organics Natural Sun SPF 25) just for kicks, to see if I liked it better.  Ugh, I hated it!  It smelled bad, came out of the tube separated as oil and goop, and -- worst of all -- left a chalky residue on my skin (fine for beach-going, but not on my face underneath makeup).  I ordered another tube of Alba Hawaiian that very day and have never looked back.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those who want a sunscreen that is literally perfect!

I had tried every sunscreen out there with SPFs that ranged from 15spf to 80spf and even with the 80spf (reapplying 6-8 times in 8 hours)  I would burn. But when I used this for the first time I was blown away! I love the beach and the pool and even going in and out of the water all day long and only reapplying once or twice I didn't get burned! This is now the only sunscreen I will use.

review/summary: Love the sunscreen but is not organic
review/text: I have used the safe Alba Botanica Kids sunblock 30 on and off for a year now and am happy that it has no chemicals (or toxic ones) and rated a good 2 on the EWG database. So I foolishly bought this brand without checking the database or ingredients assuming it was the same but with more protection. Now that I have it, I noticed that it also has 10% Homosalate and Octocrylene, and now checked the database to discover the alarming 6 rating. Damn!! But I do love the smell, protection, and the lack of parabens. I am terrified of parabens, so I will keep using this until I run out but stick with Alba Bontanica Kids afterwards.<br /><br />I have been using sunscreen religiously for the past 12 years 365 days of the year and of course previously used all the chemical sunscreens before I/we knew about the nasty chemicals. I have lots of hormonal issues and a fibroid which makes me wonder if some of my products have contributed. So I will keep my trial and error with products and make sure that I do not buy any more hormonal disrupters, xenoestrogens, and cancer aids such as parabens. Alba Bonanica seems to be the going the right direction with some of their products, but this one could improve.

review/summary: Tasty way to get flaxseed - but exactly how much?
review/text: I am trying to get milled flaxseed into my diet, but my sweet tooth still has a fierce grip on me.  So when I stumbled upon these Omega 3 Munchies while looking for non-instant powdered milk (another story, another review), they went into my shopping cart faster than a discouraged Atkins dieter can say "carbs ...NOW!"<br /><br />And holy cannoli, these gems are yummy.  Not too hard to chew and the sugary bits do not get glommed onto the teeth, like some carmelized treats.  But I would like to know exactly how much flax seed each serving has (and there are 5 quarter-cup servings in a 5 ounce bag - who are they kidding?).  A book I am reading urges people to incorporate 1/4 of milled flaxseed into their daily diet.  I know that same book would not be pleased with these ingredients: evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, and maple syrup, all of which come before flaxseed.<br /><br />But for now, just let me enjoy these, okay?  They've got to be better than the Belgian Chocolate-Covered Oreos that somehow also made it into my shopping cart.

review/text: I live in Texas. While visiting our daughter in SD recently, she purchased these at her local grocery store. She served as salad topping, but then we ate a couple of packages by the handfuls. I went back the next morning on our way back home and purchased all they had in the maple and cinnamon flavors. I emailed the company and asked where I could buy more locally (Texas). They advised that this is a new product and only available to date in the Midwest basically, but that I could order through Amazon! I am thrilled! These are fantastic! a little on the expensive side, but just learn to "pace yourself" and not eat too many! Maple is our favorite; cinnamon is good too; haven't tried banana flavor. Enjoy!

In some countries like Italy and Brazil they are very traditional specially around the holidays. In Brazil they are traditional as eggnog for us at Christmas. With that said. Bauducco is one of the best in the world, the consistency and texture is just right on this one, (and thats a big deal) hard to find, so if you know how a panettone should taste like, this is the best one for you. We love it. We normally go through 20 from November to New Years eve. I recommend, totally.  : )

review/summary: Best breadpudding ingredient EVER!
review/text: I love when this stuff comes out in stores every year, because that means I get to make bread pudding!  This bread is incredible for bread pudding, as it has spices and dried fruits already built in.  Just cube up, let sit overnight (or if in a hurry, just use it as-is), and use it as the bread component in a good bread pudding recipe (I recommend one from the Food Network).  This stuff is incredible!  It also makes fantastic stuffing!
