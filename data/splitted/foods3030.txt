review/summary: Best "breath mints" ever
review/text: I've enjoyed these anise pastilles for many years.  Just 3 ingredients, none of them artificial.  If you like anise flavor or like licorice you'll probably love these.  Everyone I've ever given them to loves them too.  Intense but not harsh, refreshing flavor.  Size and shape of tic tacs, but so much better!  I order them by the case to keep on hand.  The tin is lovely too.  Too good to be called breath mints, they are really a wonderful convection.

review/text: Given the earlier reviews, I was a little nervous that these would arrive broken, but I needed them quickly and didn't have another option.  They arrived on time and of the three dozen I ordered, not a single one was broken.  They are packaged as a Oriental Trading Company product, so I could have ordered them directly, I suppose, but they would not have arrived as quickly and with shipping I probably would have paid more.  I also really like these because they have clear wrappers with no writing or graphics on them.

If you are on a sodium restricted diet, try Campbells Low Sodium Tomato Juice.

review/summary: Very tasty!
review/text: I am really a huge advocate of cooking from scratch, with all fresh ingredients, but I really love these seasoning packets especially the one for pork.<br /><br />This has not only nice flavors, but a bit of thickening.  I use it whenever I make split pea soup (one packet of this per 1lb bag of peas and only use half the amount of water they say to use on the bag of peas...beautiful, thick split pea soup every time!) or a pot of beans with ham shanks and it always comes out beautifully flavored.  I don't add salt when I use this but other herbs can be used, of course, with fantastic results.<br /><br />This comes in several other flavors now, but this is the one that I use the most.  Just store the packets in airtight containers, such as Lock & Lock, and they keep practically forever.

review/summary: No beef ingredients!!!
review/text: My husband cannot eat red meat, so we eat a lot of pork and chicken.  We love pork in the slow cooker with potatoes, carrots, and onions, but it is nearly impossible to find any slow cooker mixes for pork that don't include some kind of beef ingredient (often beef fat).  This is the only mix I've found that has no ingredients that hubby can't have, and it's absolutely delicious!  It offers just the right mix of flavors, without taking away from the flavor of the pork.  Unfortunately, it seems that all of our local grocery stores have taken this product off the shelves, so I am thrilled to find it here on Amazon!!  :)

It is great for busy Moms like myself who love taking my kids to playdates and running errands all day but still enjoy a delicious healthy meal. My picky kids love this too! I joke with all of my stay-at-home Mom friends that my crockpot is like my personal chef and lets me play while it works all day!  I highly recommend this great product!

review/summary: Unique, original, complex and a treat NOT to be missed!
review/text: I buy my tcho chocolates at Whole Foods and absolutely LOVE their "nutty" chocolates.  I've always heard raves about these pricey tcho chocolates but its price is more than justified. I thought when I bought the "nutty" flavor that it would have nuts in it. I was wrong - it had NO NUTS! BUT IT TASTED NUTTY just like the package stated!! It tasted rich and nutty with just a little piece. I ate the whole pkg in only a few swallows fast. It's delicious and addicting and you'll never want to go back to common mainstream chocolates or even other luxury/premium chocolates when you taste just 1 piece of it! Unlike other organic chocolates, tcho chocolates are NOT incredibly bitter.<br /><br />Their chocolate is organic and fair trade. According to their package it states "Origin doesn't necessarily tell you about flavor, either. Within a single country, different regions grow different genetic varieties of cacao, in different climates and soils - each can greatly affect flavor. An Ecuador chocolate from one region can have nutty flavor notes, and from another, floral flavor notes." Tcho grades their chcolate based on a "flavor wheel" with tastes of "fruity," "citrus,", "nutty," etc with no added flavorings.

review/text: It's actually some of the best chocolate I've tried. I have Virgin America airlines to thank for this little addiction; they tuck one of these squares in the package with my turkey cranberry sandwich that I always order when flying back east to visit my kids.<br /><br />One of the best things about TCHO chocolate is the texture. It has a good "snap" when you bite it, but softens on the tongue quickly, melting away releasing intense chocolate flavor. How cool is it that the "Nutty" flavor has no nuts??? I like that the variety of flavors are so uniquely complex - Chocolatey, Fruity, and Citrus, very satisfying - so much so that you really only need one piece to get a good chocolate *fix*.<br /><br />This is definitely the kind of "vitamin" I remember to take once a day with packaging that seems like it's really an essential part of my balanced diet.<br /><br />Pleased to recommend.

review/summary: LOVE this packet of scrumptious spicy noodles!! oh, it's also vegetarian if it matters to you.
review/text: yes, it's full of salt, msg and other lovely stuff, but it can't be any worse than what you eat at many typical restaurants. i can handle a LOT of spice. seriously. in fact, sometimes i add a squirt of sriracha sauce on each bite when feeling indulgent. but this noodle would be spicy for some - if you can't handle the heat, get the sapporo ichiban's ramen. (or add less soup base, but more on that later.)<br /><br />if you don't count the high-priced specialty brand that i can't remember the name of (eh, it wasn't that good), this product also seems to have the distinction of being the only vegetarian instant ramen, thanks to the more accurate labeling of international food products. in case you're a vegetarian searching for the ingredients, here it is as printed on the package, complete with spelling errors:<br /><br />noodles: wheat flour, modified starch, palm oil, salt, gluten.<br />soup base: salt, monosodium l-glutmate, sugar, capsicum, ginger powder, red pepper, bean protein.<br />dried vegetables: green onion, mushroom, carrot, red pepper cabbage.<br /><br />since one package contains almost 100% recommended intake of sodium for a petite person, this is what i do. besides adding my own fresh veggies, i pour the water out directly from the pot after cooking (thus leaving some in there), then i only add the half of the soup base. i have no desire to drink the liquid part, and i think some of the palm oil also gets release from the noodles. i skip the dried vegetable packet since they just look gross.<br /><br />you could probably find this at a better price at your local korean grocery market if you have one nearby, but you can't beat the convenience of amazon. for about $1 each subscribe-and-save, it's worth it for me.

review/text: I have a really hard time finding these noodles locally here in Denver. The H-Mart here doesn't have them regularly.<br /><br />I am vegetarian, so it can be very difficult to find spicy ramen that doesn't have beef stock in it. In fact, this is the only spicy ramen I have found that doesn't. These are the best ramen noodles I have ever had. Slightly spicy and delicious.<br /><br />By the way, I eat a lot of spicy foods, so it is hard for me to gauge very well, but I would guess if you're not like me and don't eat much spicy stuff, these noodles could be too hot for you.

However, these are better than what you get at your local grocery store (Maruchan/Top ramen).

review/text: Hellmann's Canola Mayonnaise, 30oz<br />(Oddly enough the product link cannot find this!)<br />I cannot have dairy, gluten, soy, lime, mint or grapes, and this is THE ONLY mayo I can use.  It is WONDEFUL!  I use it in place of sour cream, sometimes make dipping sauces using it.  Add some dill, lemon, onion powder, etc. to make a bit of sauce for fish, etc.<br />Sometimes I put 1/2 C. of it in my cakes, gingerbread, etc., and they are moist and so Yummy!<br /><br />If you are on an allergen free diet, think of this as your all around sour cream, buttermilk (add a 1 tsp vinegar and about 1/3 C. of water or almond milk, stir and let sit about 10 minutes), etc.  It works wonders!  This is a MUST-HAVE in your kitchen.<br /><br />However, I am appalled at the prices here.  Get better prices at any other place - - Walmart, Cub, Target, Rainbow, Festival, Byerly's, Coburn's. etc.  Come on AMZ!  Wake up!

review/summary: The best low calorie mayonaise.
review/text: It would be very difficult to taste the difference between this and regular Hellman's Mayonaise and I think Hellman's is the best you can buy. No funny taste or funny after taste. Has the same texture and flavor of my favorite mayo and half the calories and no cholesterol.It is worth a try.

review/summary: GMO Sumatran Extra Bold
review/text: Green Mountain Organic Sumatran Extra Bold K-cups for Keurig Brewers is a rich bold coffee that is not bitter.  I love not wasting coffee by brewing one cup at a time, however, I do wish that the K-cups were a little more environmentally friendly.  I hope that they can start making the pods from something that is more biodegradable in the future.

It's smoother with a cleaner finish and overall just a better flavor than the Timothy's (which is still a great k-cup btw).  And the fact that it is organic and fair trade makes it all the better!

review/text: A good everyday coffee with no bitterness.  BTW, folks, K-cups marked "Extra Bold" simply have more than the usual amount of coffee in the K-cup, allowing one to make the larger cup of coffee without it's being weak -- doesn't mean it's extra dark.

review/summary: Excellent coffee
review/text: I originally bought this coffee because the one I usually drink, GM Nantucket, was out of stock, and was concerned that "extra bold" would mean a coffee that was overly strong and bitter.  Instead, it is very full-bodied and smooth, and is now my coffee of choice.  I recently compared Nantucket and Organic Sumatran Extra Bold back-to-back, and found the former almost tasteless in comparison.

review/text: This is, by far, the tastiest K-Cup variety I've tried. I've had about 10 different types, and this one is a hands-down favorite. Everyone who's tried it at my house has loved it and been very impressed that this came from a Keurig. I think the body and richness is comparable to coffee made in a drip or (don't shoot me, coffee purists) a press!<br /><br />The flavor just barely edges toward bitter, but in a very pleasant way. It's rich and dark and very full-bodied. A great coffee for those of us who prefer it dark (but not burnt in the Starbucks fashion).<br /><br />Highly recommend this product!

review/text: I find I have grown somewhat addicted to having one of these crisps every morning with my coffee - they're not terribly filling because the crisps are relatively thin, but if like me you just need a little something to munch on in the morning these are the perfect pick.  Easy to grab and go, delicious, crunchy, all that you could look for in the morning.  Nice to buy them on sale or in bulk because they can be expensive.<br /><br />I like both fruit flavors of this product, but not as much the chocolate or cinnamon flavors.  I'm hoping they'll introduce more fruit flavors in the future.

review/summary: Good for the Price...
review/text: Initially, I was a little disappointed in this bonsai tree. It was a little smaller than I expected and looked a little more fake than I had hoped, but with a little work it worked out well. The ends between the trunk and the branches looked very fake as they are a green plastic color. I took a brown sharpie and did a little color work on them and it looked much better. Some of the plastic leaves also looked very fake, but I used some sharpies on those too to add a little color and it looked much more real and turned out to be a nice looking bonsai for the money. The moss at the bottom of the trunk is nice looking and a very good touch which adds to the overall appearance. The trunk of the tree is fairly nice looking, but I also did some touch-up work on it with the sharpies, which made it look better too.<br /><br />So the bottom line on this product is that it is fairly inexpensive, but for the money, and with a little effort on your part, this can be a decent looking artificial bonsai, and it is definitely easier to keep alive than a real tree! If you are on a budget or looking for something which is easy to care for, this is a decent option for you. Not the best, but good for the money. 4 Stars.<br /><br />Bohdi Sanders, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0979676460">Wisdom of the Elders</a>

review/text: After a bout of upset tum from a bad bag of food (lasted ~1 month!), my vet recommended vegetarian organic.  This fits the bill and, fortunately, my dog loves it!  Eventually, I want to get her back on a meaty diet...partly because this is expensive but also because it is just more natural for dogs to eat meat.  This is good because there's no yeast, no soy, no meat, and gets just basic ingredients that shouldn't upset a tummy.  We also add plain yogurt and OptaGest to her food in the evenings.  She's enjoying herself again.

In fact, the antioxidants contained in the bar are numerous, but to mention a few:<br />Goji Berries, Acai Berries, Cranberries, Maqui Berries, Mangosteen, Pomegrantes, plus each bar contains the equivalent<br />Resveratrol in thirty bottles of Red Wine. It is certified by Brunswick Labs and made in the USA.<br />They'll be days where I'll have one as a snack and days where it will be a meal replacement. Besides having a long shelf life<br />- My bar expires on March 14, 2013. I'm delighted with my purchase.

review/text: I first ordered Regeneration USA Anti-Aging Whole Food Bar, Goji Flavor, 2.07-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12) with an external website but soon after ordering I received an email informing me the bars are one week after "the best by' date. They asked me if I still want the product or not. Thinking of the ingredients in this product, I considered that one week after 'best by date' is not something that I want. So I stopped the purchase. I mention the product was cheaper on that website.<br /><br />So, I go ahead and order my products on Amazon. Surprise!!! When I got them, I checked the expiration date... the bars were not within ''the best by date'' range, but one week after. At least the other website was honest and informed me on the issue, whereas Amazon didn't.

review/summary: BEWARE "YEAST EXTRACT"
review/text: Although my cats rejected Merrick's Quail & Chicken, I'm giving it five stars [but not anymore - see UPDATE below] because I think it smells great and the ingredients list is excellent. After supplementing their regular canned food with small amounts of the Quail & Chicken over a period of about two weeks (six cans divided between two cats) in order to introduce it gradually, the cats began refusing to eat it all together. It smells like roasted poultry and they ate it readily at first. I feel it must not have agreed with their tummies, or they would have continued to eat it. But who knows why these things happen with fussy cats. I tried to reintroduce it several times over the next few weeks, but they'd have none of it.<br /><br />I haven't tried lots of different natural canned foods for my cats, but I have found two that they consistently like. Those are Natural Life Lamaderm Lamb & Rice Platter and Natural Balance Indoor Cat Formula. But who knows why they prefer those, or how long that preference will last.<br /><br />UPDATE (July 17, 2011): I've recently learned about an ingredient in Merrick's canned cat foods that may have caused my cats to reject it, after having eaten it readily at first. That ingredient is "yeast extract." It seems that this is just an innocent-sounding name for glutamates (the same as in monosodium glutamate or MSG). It's an appetite stimulant (flavor enhancer) with the same side effects as MSG. For the many who are sensitive to it, the side effects of glutamate include headaches, dizziness, abdominal cramps, heartburn, etc.<br /><br />If a cat eats something that tastes good, but then the cat feels sick, it will eventually reject that food. I'm glad they have that survival instinct or they'd be sick all the time thanks to these dumb pet food companies that will feed them anything. It would be a real coup to get pets addicted to your brand of pet food by adding a flavor enhancer that other brands didn't have, now wouldn't it? Of course, it if makes them sick and they reject it, then the scheme has backfired.<br /><br />And, by the way, my cats still enjoy the Natural Life and Natural Balance foods that I've been feeding them. So it seems it wasn't just a passing preference.<br /><br />Because of the deceptive ingredient "yeast extract" and its potential for making pets sick, I now give this food a "1 star" rating.

review/summary: Dogs Obsess About
review/text: I have tried lots of treats for my dogs, but these are the only ones they never seem to tire of. Most treats they love then lose interest in pretty quickly. I am not sure why, but these simple treats, a soft dried apple with a piece of chicken wrapped around it, are their favorite. I have to order these on Subscribe and Save because they can't get enough of them.<br /><br />Also, the treats claim to have glucosamine and chondroitin in them, which is good for hips and back of dogs who struggle with those problem areas. As the owner of 4 dachshunds, I am always worried about their backs. In fact, two of my dogs have really hurt their backs in the past. I don't know if it is these treats or something else, but we haven't had a back incident in a very long time. I like to think it is the treats, but I couldn't tell you for sure. Although I am immensely happy the back issues have subsided! Not to mention, the treats make me the favorite person in the house whenever they come out!

review/text: My 18-month old cockapoo loves these Dogswell Veggie Life Happy Hip treats more than any other treat I give to him.  He gets all excited if he sees the package.  When he's a good boy and I give him one, he trots off to another room to eat it (like he wants to savor this particular treat and not just gobble it down).  The treats are chewy and not easy to gulp down, so it lasts a bit longer than most.  I like that these are natural and good for his hips.  Although he is young, I believe he should have the "healthy hip" treats before he gets old and his hips feel achy.  I only wish each treat were a bit smaller (sometimes I cut them in half, but you need a sharp knife or kitchen scissors to do that).

Some of the kids broke them open at the party and had a lot of fun tasting and comparing flavors.  There is a guide to the flavors on the back of each box and each box is plastic sealed.  If you are planning on having a HP party, these are a MUST!  You and your guests won't be disappointed.  The price is right also (they are generally between $2.50 and $4.50 in the stores, if you can find them) and delivery was right on time.

review/summary: Really saves clean up and make great coffee at cheaper prices.
review/text: After messing with cleaning the Keurig coffee brewing single cup server, I wanted my own brand of coffee at greatly reduced prices.  When using the lil grey pod replacement and screen filter I had lots of trouble washing the screen filter so I could make a new cup of coffee.  The EZ Pod system with the paper filters was the best method to use my own brands at greatly reduced prices.  All you do is place the paper filter paper in the EZ cup and close it up, then place it in the regular K-cup holder.  Then choose your cup size and brew it.  I don't use regular grind but fine as this gives the best flavor per cup just like the regular K-cups you buy in the 12 or 48 or 80 piece boxes but at pennies a cup.  Very easy clean up as you just remove the filter paper.  If I had my choice I would improve the EZ cup lid with a larger rim for easier removal from the cup.  But this is a minor thing.

review/summary: Warning: these can be habit forming!
review/text: Cashews are the tastiest (and one of the costliest) of the what we call nuts. Although a nut in the culinary sense, in the botanical sense the fruit of the cashew is actually a seed that grows from the cashew tree. Their caloric numbers may be a bit high, but they provide surprising amounts of potassium, protein, and dietary fiber.<br /><br />That being said, these are some of the tastiest cashews that you'll find, and they have no trans fat, either. Must also note that Emerald's "On the Go" canister" is an excellent variation from the standard packaging, featuring a handy lid that seems about right to measure a single portion.<br /><br />Pros: good sized halves and pieces, lightly salted with an excellent natural buttery cashew taste. No trans fat.<br /><br />Cons: oil and sodium... but it's the salt that makes them great.<br /><br />Serving size: 1 ounce (about 1/4 cup)<br />Servings per container: 10<br />Calories per serving: 160<br />Calories from fat: 120<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want some really flavorsome cashews, Emerald does a tremendous job with these. For those who prefer whole cashews, you might try Emerald Nuts Whole Cashews, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4), and for an interesting (and highly-recommended) five-star taste treat, you might want to try Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashew, 10oz Canister (Pack of 4). All of these have outstanding natural buttery cashew taste, and are packaged in the same handy canister.<br /><br />Warning: any of these can be habit-forming!

review/summary: Good candy!
review/text: A brief tutorial for those who are unfamiliar with SweeTarts.  Tiny, sugary, multi-colored candies.  They are sweet.  They are tart.  Hence the name.  If you are confused as to what to do with them, instructions appear on each one.  BITE 'EM, it says.  If you do, there is a burst of flavor.  Very tasty!<br /><br />One thing, though.  I have been eating these since forever, and they have been re-branded as Willy Wonka SweeTarts.  Should I be nervous?  If you remember that story, Willy Wonka is known for some dangerous candies.  I keep thinking that one day I will bite into one of these thingies and the next sound will be all like "Oompa Loompa Loompity Doo" and I'll be all like "Uh oh!"  Just saying.

review/summary: Coffe shop quality capuccino at home
review/text: I love coffee. Usually I would not recommend Maxwell House as I consider it a "supermarket brand". I was very surprised with the quality of this cappuccino. My wife loves it too!<br /><br />Contrary to instructions, we brew milk first then the espresso, this makes it look very nice, especially on a transparent cup. The taste is smooth and velvety, with low acidity and aftertaste. You can buy extra espresso T-Discs separately and brew an extra shot if you really like your coffee bold (like I do).<br /><br />In about a minute, you have a cappuccino that is as good as that of many coffee shops. Yes, it is not nearly close to making my personal list of best coffees I have tested, but you can't beat the convenience and cost. We also use it a lot to entertain guests at our house. Works great with any dessert.<br /><br />Instead of buying them one box for 6 coffees at a time, this 5-pack from Amazon really saves us money. Each set comes with 16 T-Discs: 8 espresso and 8 milk. So this 5-pack will be good for 40 cappuccinos.

review/text: This cappuccino is very good and tastes almost as good as Starbucks Latte Primo, T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers, 8 Count Packages (Pack of 2). The cream foams up well in the Tassimo machine. The only difference in taste between this Cappuccino drink and the Starbucks Latte Primo is that the coffee flavor is slightly stronger in the Starbucks product. Also, with the Cappuccino you brew the coffee first and then use the milk disc. With the Starbucks Latte Primo you brew the milk first then the coffee.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a bargain buy. As long as you are not looking for a slightly stronger coffee flavor, I'd suggest purchasing this instead of the Starbucks brand as both products use expresso coffee and milk discs.

review/summary: White Cheddar Blast!
review/text: If, like me, you crave a little popcorn with your cheese, then welcome aboard! This sharp white cheddar popcorn by Deep River Snacks, really fits the bill. The cheese is real and intense. The corn is light and flavorful, with a great texture. It comes in a two ounce bag -- two servings -- but, trust me, this is a one serving experience. For this indulgence, you get 300 calories, three grams of saturated fat, zero trans fat, four of fiber, six of protein, and six of sugar. Overall, a superb and pretty healthy snack...one that's already on my 'critical' list.

review/summary: Deep River does it again, good, messy cheese popcorn bliss
review/text: This is my third Deep River product and all of them have been superb. I had tried 2 potato chip flavors before and based on the great quality decided to give these a try. They are a large, satisfying, tasty snack. The cheese is very generous and there is enough that it will get all over your fingers. It definitely falls in the 'gourmet popcorn' category but I wish there had been just a tad bit more bite to the cheese.<br /><br />Also as a previous reviewers mentioned it is 300 calories in the bag and a good amount of unsaturated fat. But you do get all natural ingredients, no trans fats, not much saturated fat, and a good tasting product. When comparing calories versus how satisfying it is, it is a pretty good tradeoff overall. To me, it is obvious Deep River takes care with their products. They are well on their way to becoming a big player on the quality snack scene.

review/summary: Best baby white cheddar popcorn on the market!
review/text: I've been buying this product for years.  It is definitely the best baby white cheddar cheese popcorn I have tried.  For those who love strong cheese flavour, this is the strongest you will find (at least that I know of).  I wish they made it in extra sharp, but they probably wanted a "middle of the road" cheese for the majority of consumers who might find extra sharp too strong for them.<br /><br />In any event, there really aren't that many companies that make baby white popcorn with cheddar cheese in the first place.  The larger-sized corn and yellow corn just are not the same quality as baby white, cheese or no cheese.<br /><br />That crap made by Smartfood that is sold in the markets is horrendous (not to mention lots of partially popped kernels).  The popcorn made by Deep River has less hulls because it is baby-sized, which is better for the digestive track (especially for those of us that are older).  Also less partially popped kernels than the other brands I have tried.<br /><br />There is great popcorn out of Colorado (Cornzapoppin) made fresh just before shipping, but it is full-sized.  The flavours are great, but there's just nothing like baby white corn (did I say that already?).  It's also rather expensive, but does make a great gift for those you want to spend money on.<br /><br />So until someone else makes a high quality baby white sharp cheddar popcorn, I am loyal to this Deep River Snacks product!

review/summary: Great for the price!
review/text: Overall, it's a very good white cheddar popcorn.  The AGED white cheddar flavor is great!  There is a reasonable amount of white cheddar on the popcorn, but I really wish there was 25-50% more cheese on it.  But at a dollar per bag, it's a great price.  The 2oz. bags are the perfect snack size.  When I get the bigger bags, I tend to eat it all until it's gone, which is often too much, so I'm a big fan of this size.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the popcorn (under the cheese) tends to have a bit of a burnt-flavor.  The kernels don't look burned at all, and they are very crisp and crunchy, but an odd burned-corn essence tends to compete with the cheese.  (I'm not sure how else to describe it).  I have tried every brand of white cheddar popcorn that I can find, and this is in my top 3.  It would be my #1 favorite if they added more cheese, and cooked their corn differently, or somehow tamed the "burnt" taste I'm describing.<br /><br />I still highly recommend, and I will be buying again =)

review/summary: A Worthy Substitute ....
review/text: If you have ever looked at a recipe for Creme Brulee made from scratch, you may have started to shake uncontrollably.  With my cooking skills and patience, I found the mere reading of the ingredients and instructions daunting.  So, in my characteristic way, I began to look for the contemporary substitute or recreation (let's not use such a vile term as 'knockoff').  I have now tried several that are on the market and find this one quite lovely and very easy to make.  The most difficult task is pouring the hot liquid into a rammekin (that is a new word for me as well).  But, my best work is reserved for the carmelizing of the pure cane sugar with my butane fired blow torch.  Pure ecstasy!  [I have also used the dark sugar that comes with the kit but prefer the white stuff.] Actually, this stuff is great but I have reserved the five star rating for the real thing ...

review/summary: This helps me to make a restaurant quality sauce for duck
review/text: Several times a year I treat my guests (and myself) to a meal starring boneless duck breasts.  I love the sweet, dark and rich flavor of the meat.  Sometimes I make a fruit based sauce (orange, raspberry or fig) and sometimes a cream and wine based one.  Regardless of which type I choose, I ALWAYS include this product to bring extra taste to the sauce.<br /><br />Glace de Canard is a 20 times reduction of duck and chicken stock, although the duck flavor dominates.  Following the classic French recipe for duck stock it includes carrot, celery and onion stock, tomato paste and wine.  This type of heavily concentrated stock is a staple in professional kitchens but usually out of the reach of the home chef.  First one must have the duck bones and the hours and hours needed to not only make stock but to reduce it to 1/20 of it's volume.  This (and More Than Gourmet's other products) allows me to make the type of sauce that one finds in a great restaurant.<br /><br />A good recipe is included with the glace and additional ones can be found on-line at their website.  I usually use recipes from a great sauce reference book "Sauces, Classic and Contemporary Sauce Making" by James Peterson (in his most recent edition of the book he mentions More Than Gourmet by name and recommends the use of their products).  For some of the demi-glaces that I use often (the vegetable, chicken and brown sauce) I buy the larger 16 oz. tubs.  Because I don't treat myself to duck breast that often I prefer these 1.5 oz. containers.  If you are into cooking and love duck, as I do, I think that you will enjoy this.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470194960">Sauces: Classical and Contemporary Sauce Making</a>

review/summary: big european coffee
review/text: is what my husband said this coffee reminds him of.  He likes a mid (not strong) taste.  I don't drink coffee hot. My idea of coffee is a wonderful smell in the morning that I will make and add to a latte or I guess I mean a chocolate/coffee smoothie that I make at home.  This one suits that bill.  It is a full flavor to me or strong.  I believe it would even make a second cup if I so desired.<br /><br />Would I pay a huge amount for it?  No, I think this coffee is relatively expensive. There are only 15 pods in the box and it happens to have Marley on the box.  Is that the reason for the cost or is pod coffee just expensive?<br /><br />Since I don't have a pod machine I boiled a cup of water and added it to the pod in a cup with a spoon holding it down.  Worked well for me.<br /><br />Good coffee but not worth what they want for it.

review/summary: convenient, low-acid, but a bit weak
review/text: The first thing that hit me is that these appear to be a low-acid gype of coffee....I didn't get that icky feeling some coffees give you after you drink them.  That is a definite plus.  But the coffee itself isn't that strong either.  I'm not into Kona or really deep flavors, I like just a medium blend.  But this still seemed weak.  It almost came across as coffee-tea than a strong cup of joe.<br /><br />I don't think I'd order this particular blend again.
