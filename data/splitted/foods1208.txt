review/summary: My Dogs Love It
review/text: Have a eight year old Jack Russell and a thirteen year old mixed breed and needed an all natural low fat treat that was not expensive but had assorted flavors for the dogs. When i found Blue Dog Bakery Treats I was pleased with the low price and assortment. Purchased a pack of six and have been totally satisfied. Each dog loves the assortment and taste of each biscuit. The different biscuit sizes also makes it easy to give large pieces to the mixed bread and small pieces to the Jack Russell.

review/summary: Great healthy treats your dogs will love!
review/text: I have two very finicky greyhounds, and they LOVE these biscuits! There are several varieties in each box, from Peanut butter and molasses to chicken. The only sweetener is molasses - no refined sugars or fructose. The price for this multi-bix case is exceptional; I've previously bought these on sale at PetSmart for higher prices.

review/summary: Natural dog treats even humans can eat!
review/text: I bought these very cheaply through a lightning deal because I am always looking for tasty treats to spoil my puppies with. The package comes with 6 boxes and this is a lot of treats! Some treats are bigger, others smaller; I usually try to break the bigger ones in half, otherwise the dogs continue to eat the treat way after they earned it. These are some of the few dog treats I have found that actually smell and taste good for humans as well, that usually means they are pretty healthy in my opinion. The variety is great, allows the dogs a surprise treat every time. Definitely a good buy, gave away a box to a friend and their dog loved it as well. I understand the need to have bigger treats but I would have preferred some more smaller ones because these cookies are hard to break.

review/summary: Immediately became my dogs favorite treat!
review/text: I don't write a ton of reviews. I just leach off of all of yours. :) That said, my dog absolutely loves these. I was surprised just how much. She's a finicky bitch, and on many occasions I've bought her treats and foods and she'll turn her nose up to it.<br /><br />I let her choose her treats. We usually have multiple options for her and she'll take whatever gets her attention first. When I added these to the mix she went for them every single time. Every time. These are the only treats in our pantry these days. Highly recommended for Jack Russel Terriers.

review/summary: Great treat for a picky dog!
review/text: Our dog often turns her nose up at treats.  She is very particular about what she eats and she LOVES these!  She does prefer certain flavors, but she eats all of them.  When the box came I was a little worried about how many there were for a first try, but I know she will eat every last one.  You can't beat the price for a treat like this!

review/summary: Great natural treat and my 4 dogs love them!
review/text: My dogs love the flavor of these treats and I like the large size so I can split them up between 2 dogs. There are smaller ones in there I like to give to my dachshunds. I read that some posters on here eat these too and I tried one and I didn't like it, but I guess that is why it is for dogs! I bought these on special,6 boxes for 20.00 with free shipping. I like that these are for sale at my local Walmart so it makes it easy to pick up. I am not sure I would pay more than 3.50 a box for these since they don't last long with my 4 dogs.

review/summary: My Son will eat them!
review/text: My son has autism. He is on a gluten-free, casein-free, and soy free diet, so there is not a lot of pre-packaged stuff out there that he can eat that he actually wants to eat. We have tried the Glutino pretzels, they are good but have soy. My typical son on an unrestricted diet likes them and asks for them. But my gf/cf/sf son can't have them.<br /><br />I brought home a few sample bags of these from a TACA meeting (Talk About Curing Autism) and my son ate them right up. I was glad to see them on this site so I could order them in bulk.<br /><br />I tried them and didn't think they tasted bad. Of course, they could use more salt for my taste, but my son gets enough sodium from other sources, so I'm glad that they aren't salted.

So the product must have been sitting somewhere for a long time before it was sent to us. Plus it does not taste as good as the one without the sesame.

review/summary: HIGH FIBER SNACK!!
review/text: I love these small, round 3/4" pretzels!  What sets them apart is that they have 3 gr of FIBER in every serving!  That equals my husband's Metamucil (registered trademark) dietary fiber!  Plus, they taste very good, it's hard to stop snacking...<br /><br />Don't look for alot of salt on the outside, but the overall flavor is salty enough for me. A serving has 230 mg, or 10% of your daily sodium intake.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts: each bag has 4 (30g) servings of 40 pretzels, each serving has 130 calories, 30 from fat, 3.5g total fat, 2g saturated fat (9%), No trans fat or cholesterol, 24g carbohydrate (8%), 3g dietary fiber, 1g sugar, .6g protein.<br /><br />I once bought a bag of the Ener-G GF 2.65 oz. pretzels,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFIIZO">Ener-G Foods Crisp Pretzels, Wheat-Free, 2.65-Ounce Bags (Pack of 20)</a> and they taste great - but each serving has twice the salt, almost twice as much fat (6g), and less than 1g fiber.  That is alot of salt for a snack.  (all the other values are about the same).  Put enough fat and salt in anything, and it will taste good...I choose the Wylde pretzels!<br /><br />PS:  Don't eat these unless you have sound teeth - I had a temporary, plastic crown break while eating them.

review/summary: Autism Spectrum Disorder
review/text: I have a daughter with Autistic Spectrum Disorder... DAN! (Defeat Autism Now!) had an article that implied some connection between gluten and dairy allergies to behavioral difficulties in children with this disorder. So, we decided to try a gluten-free, dairy-free diet to see what happened. I have to say I have seen a good deal of improvement in her general behavior as well as her focus and retention rate.<br /><br />From what I understand it is a good product for kidney patients as well because it is low protein. And it's Kosher Parve.<br /><br />I tried these pretzles because of this new diet and now my whole family is addicted! They are tasty, crunchy and not too salty, but still satisfy my desire for salty foods. We will be buying these from now on.

review/summary: Great gluten-free snack
review/text: I have endometriosis and was looking for snacks that would not aggravate my condition.  These pretzels are so delicious, I can eat them all day with no negative effects.  I will say that people either hate these or love these though.  The people who hate them seem to be males more than females and usually are people who do not have any alergies.  My best work friend (who is vegan) sneaks into my desk constantly for them.  The taste is like eating just the outside crunchy part of a regular pretzel.  They are very crunchy and well suited for travelling, stashing in your office desk, and snacking during surfing the web.  I reccomend these to people with food alergies that miss their wheat snack products and often get a craving for a salty snack.<br />Additionally, I find them to be a great value and they last a long time.  They are less suceptable to getting stale than regular snacks.  I ordered two boxes eight months ago and still have a few bags left.  When I open the new bags, they are just as fresh and tasty as the ones I opened eight months ago.  If you get tired of snacks and want to rotate variety, these pretzels will wait until you are ready to fit them back into your lunch pack.

I bought these for my gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free son & for small children, broken food is a big deal.  I will pursue a refund from Amazon.<br /><br />Once you can get past the broken pieces, they taste good.

review/summary: Great to eat pretzels again
review/text: I was very happy with this product.  Even my husband, who doesn't need to eat gluten free, liked them.  Nice and crunchy with a very good taste.  I tried a smaller bag at the local store for 2 bucks and liked it.  Then, I saw these and it was a much better buy.  Compare prices though, because right now this size isn't the best deal.  It was when I bought it.

review/text: Another great produce carried by Amazon for those suffering from Celiac Disease or anybody else who wants a great tasting crunchy pretzel.  My husband was diagnosed with Celiac Disease 4 years ago.  It has been my goal to make him feel less restricted in a world that is chock full of gluten.  I read every food label of anything I purchase so it is nice to know that there is a wonderful worry-free snack food out there that tastes even better than regular pretzels.  Good thing you can get this product in 4 oz bags or you would not be able to pace yourself. Thanks again Amazon for making such a wonderful produce as Wylde Pretzels available and accessible to all.

review/text: We have been a gluten free family for many years and have been enjoying the new products that are now continully being introduced.  These pretzels are not nearly as good as the ones by Ener-G Foods (small size bags) or by Glutano (larger, family size bags).  These Wylde pretzels are, as one reviewer already commented, not salty enough - that is, not salty enough for me to feel they qualify as satisfying a pretzel yearning.  These pretzels are also much harder than the others, which I don't find appealing.  That being said, I would highly recommend the Glutano or the Ener-G Foods pretzels over these.  I rated it 2-stars simply for being another gluten free product.

review/summary: Genmai Cha Green Tea with Roasted Brown Rice
review/text: Overall this is a great product if you are a loose leaf tea drinker.  I say overall because, like most things, there are pluses and minuses.  I have been drinking loose leaf teas for about ten years now.  I would not rank myself as an expert, but I have sampled many varieties and flavors which I suppose gives me some degree of knowledge.<br /><br />I usually purchase a different brand Genmaicha which I have grown accustomed to over the years.  In my research this other tea is about what you would expect from a Genmaicha: loose leaf green tea with roasted brown rice in about a 50-50 ratio.  The Shirakiku I am reviewing now is somewhat different.  This "Genmai Cha" (note the spelling difference)seems to consist mostly of roasted brown rice with some loose leaf green tea and the addition of Matcha tea.  If you are not familiar with Matcha tea is is a Japanese tea variety which is commonly used in tea ceremonies.  It is in powdered form and prepared by being whisked into water not brewed and strained like loose leaf tea.  Had I known that this tea was manufactured the way it is I don't think that I would have purchased it.  That said, I am still happy with my purchase and enjoy this tea on a daily basis.<br /><br />My critique of the drinkability of the tea itself is a mixed bag.  The flavor is "in the neighborhood" of my usual Genmaicha.  However it is definitely not the same.  The bready flavor of the roasted rice is overpowered by the Matcha tea.  In addition, to me Matcha tea is somewhat akin to instant tea.  Although many may disagree strongly with that statement, it is how I feel.  I simply prefer brewed loose leaf tea, and since I was not aware of the nature of this tea, I suppose I am a little dissapointed.  In the cup the tea is very cloudy.  Genmaicha in general is a cloudy cup due to the rice.  The Genmai Cha is about twice as cloudy, due in part to the Matcha and also the high percentage of roasted rice that I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />The other factors to consider with this tea is the quantity and the pricing.  The Shirakiku comes in two vacuum sealed bricks weighing 2.2 pounds (1 Kilogram) each.  That means that you get about 4.4 pounds of tea in total.  That's a lot of tea!  Which leads me to the price.  After tax and with free shipping through Amazon I paid less than $10.50 per pound of tea.  This is less than half of what I would expect to pay for my usual brand.<br /><br />Overall the tea is a great value.  Cost per pound is very low, but 2 Kilograms is a lot of tea.  And the flavor is very good.  So I would have to say that I took away two stars for the introduction of the Matcha tea, but I added one star for the amazing value this tea offers.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cost per pound<br />Flavor is very good<br /><br />Cons:<br />4.4 pounds of tea (you will be drinking it for a long time....)<br />Not a true Genmaicha (at least not to purists)<br />Lots of sediment at the bottom of the cup

review/summary: Excellent, especially for the price
review/text: I am nowhere near an expert, although I have been drinking Japanese teas for more than 40 years, from back in the day when the only way to get it was to have it shipped directly from the family in Japan.<br /><br />Overall this is a great tea, especially for the price, since the matcha isn't cheap. The genmaicha portion is tasty, and the matcha (which always comes only as a powder, even for tea ceremony) isn't too heavy, with enough added in to give it plenty of flavor. This tea is good for drinking hot or cold, and can easily be made cup by cup or pitcher at a time.<br /><br />Sometimes there is confusion about matcha and genmaicha. Genmaicha tends to be a more subtle flavor, while often people describe matcha as "grassy" and "bitter", but the flavor changes a bit when added to other things, so it is a very complimentary flavor. Matcha is considered very healthy partly because, instead of drinking tea leaf-infused water, you are drinking the actual tea leaves, since the matcha is a fine powder. There are different quality levels of matcha, and while the matcha in this tea isn't the highest, it is still very tasty, and I have been drinking it for years. Additionally, there is no difference between "genmai cha" and "genmaicha." It's just where the translators decided to break the word. (Similar to "icecream" and "ice cream.") The "matchairi" in the label of the tea means that the tea contains matcha.

review/text: I love this stuff! I moved to the Ozarks about ten years ago, and couldn't find the chili garlic sauce locally. I was ecstatic when I found it through Amazon. The scent alone is worth the money. When I opened the first jar it was like all kinds of good meals came back to mind...sort of like walking past a lilac bush and remembering grandma's front porch, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />This chili sauce is hot, but not overpowering. (I think it's probably about tabasco-level strength). It has a LOT of flavor. Some hot sauces/chili sauces have either a vinegar flavor or a ketchup flavor, not this stuff. Its genuine chili and garlic smell is pungent. In addition to typical oriental fare (which I sometimes add freshly grated ginger to the sauce for that - yum), I eat this chili sauce on pasta, pizza, sandwiches (delicious on toasted subs), eggs, cheese & crackers; it's also good stirred into cocktail sauce for shrimp. Highly recommended!

review/text: I drank sport tea back when I lived in Colorado...now that I've moved on, I had been trying to find it.  I'd found it at some smaller online stores at a higher price, but it's much better with two day shipping.<br /><br />I just wish the boxes were bigger, as my fridge tea container takes 6 of these big bags to fill, and only about 4 days to empty.

review/summary: Sportea great for hot weather challenges
review/text: I went from San Francisco's 60-ish weather to 100+ degrees in Northern California. Had nausea and after a few glasses of water, 2 sodas and lunch, it did not improve. Our friend gave me a glass of this and I perked up immediately as it balanced my electrolytes. Drank it the rest of the time in the hot weather and it really made it much more comfortable and I had no more dehydration or nausea. I am a Coca Cola addict and am finding this is a great replacement, no sugar or calories. Fresh and refreshing. Making it a staple in our household and on day trips in warm weather.

review/summary: good tea but has lemon taste
review/text: I've been trying to find a drink to replace the sodas that I drink daily and while I like tea, I don't like the amount of sugar I have to put in the tea to enjoy it. I've read several reviews and thought I would try it. Well I guess I didn't read all the reviews and thought it would be important to let people know that while this tea is pretty good, it has a lemon taste to it. Now for some people they like lemon in their tea, but I don't like lemon at all. I will say that the lemon flavor is not as strong as some lemon teas i've tasted, so I will try to develope a taste for it, but if you don't like lemon in your tea you probably won't fall in love with this tea.

review/text: Sportea has become the default drink here at home, replacing things like diet coke, and other things that weren't good for us. I first had Sportea at Tarpy's Road House, a favorite restaurant here in Monterey, California. I asked our food server what kind of tea it was, and promptly went home and ordered some on Amazon.com.<br />I have been a steady customer ever since. If you like tea, I think you will find this very refreshing...

review/text: I first encountered sport tea in 2000 when I was working in a funky cafe.  Our chef had been trained in San Francisco, and she brought alot of cool things back from the west coast with her. Not sure where sport tea is from, but she had had it there.  I got hooked then and I had not had it in over 10 years and looked it up on here.  I have been buying it again since I found it.  Love how you can get several boxes at once for a good price.  It is so refreshing.  Nothing compares to it!  If you are wondering if you should buy it the answer is YES!!!!!

It tastes lightly sweet due to the citrusy flavor. I first tried this tea in a 5-star restaurant and had to have more so I signed up for quarterly delivery.

review/summary: Thirst Quencher!
review/text: I LOVE this tea. It truly does what it says. The hydration and thirst quenching claims are true. My husband is a personal trainer. He is the one who introduced me to SporTea. We live in Arizona, so heat and needing good hydration is a way of life. This stuff really helps beyond what "sport" waters and other products do.<br /><br />The only thing to be prepared for is, that you do not brew it in a tea pot or kettle. It is submerged in water and left to develop for several hours, or overnight in the fridge. I personally like the flavor after 24 hours. You need to plan ahead to have the tea ready for when you plan to need it. IT IS WORTH THE EXTRA EFFORT!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E10A">SPORTea Iced Tea, 7-Quart Size 3-Ounce Tea Bags (Pack of 4)</a><br />I moved from Colorado, 10 years ago, where I was first introduced to Iced SPORTea at my favorite burger joint in Denver: My Brother's Bar. After years of bringing boxes of SPORTea back home with me in my suitcase... or having family and friends living in Denver, pack extra boxes of SPORTea in their luggage when ever coming for a visit... I was happy to finally order this wonderful tea  through Amazon. ( I buy enough that I rarely have to pay for shipping )<br />I don't like "sweetened" or lemon in my tea. ( SPORTea has neither sweetner or lemon ) but the flavors for me, were "aquired". (not your regular "Lipton's Ice Tea" ) ... but a wonderful blend of flavors with a citrus undertones. I drink it during my workouts at the gym, ...when my energy feels low but I don't want any more caffeine, ... AND ALWAYS when I feel a cold coming on... I just keep on drinking my SPORTea, and a cold never seems to arrive with any sort of significance.<br />IT really works for me, and performs as it claims it will.  EXCELLENT BEVERAGE IF CHOICE !

Living in the South I needed to find a low calorie substitute to the traditional sweet tea that's everywhere. Sport Tea is wonderful! It is a very mild tea--it doesn't compare at all to sweet tea or Lipton. It has a light, gingery taste. I also love that you brew it overnight in cold water in the fridge--no boiling water!

review/summary: A Different Type of Olive Oil - Worth A Try!
review/text: I've learned to like olive oils as dipping oils and sometimes for cooking but I didn't know that there is more to olive oils than meets the eye.  It's just like looking for fine wine.  This olive oil has a very subtle aroma with a robust flavor and slight bitterness to it (which I understand is more for cooking rather than for dipping.)  I'm excited to use this to enhance flavors with my pasta, salads and meat dishes.  If you love olive oils, you might want to try this because it is a different type of olive oil than what you are probably used to buying before.  It's made from 200yr old olive trees from Spain and I doubt if you can get the same taste anywhere else in the world.

Glad I did... some of the items in this package tasted great, some of them were mediocre, and a few were vile, one brand of cider tasting remarkably similar to what Red Bull and shampoo mixed together probably tastes like.
