review/summary: GREAT FOOD
review/text: I have been using this for years for my Chihuahua's and they love it. The small mini-chunks are just great for them as they have such a small mouth. No bad gas and perfect stools. And my vet reccomends Nuto brand formulas.  My Chihuahua's are going on ten years old now and thanks to Nutro they are in perfect health, good teeth and shiny coats. You simply can't go wrong with Nutro.

review/summary: Beware of kosher tax.
review/text: This product claims to be Natural.  But there is nothing natural about paying a rabbi to bless a jar of peanut butter. Skippy Natural is a kosher certified product, which means that the consumer is paying slightly extra to cover the rabbinical fees involved in the certification procedure.<br /><br />Not all people want kosher products. Skippy should sell a non-kosher version of this product, for a reduced fee. But they don't.<br /><br />For those who don't know:<br />In order to determine if a product has been certified kosher, just look at the product label.  If you see the letter U with a circle around it, or the letter K with a circle around it (usually it is located somewhere near the product logo), then the product has been certified kosher.<br />You might be surprised to realize how many products in your cupboards have been certified kosher.  When I first learned about this kosher tax/scam, I ran to my cupboards and began looking at labels.  I found that nearly half of the products in my cupboards had been certified kosher.<br /><br />The flavor of this product is good.  But peanut butter always tastes good.  Skippy doesn't deserve credit for the fact that peanut butter tastes good.

review/text: I have nasty food allergies to wheat, dairy, eggs, corn, peanuts, and about 2 dozen other foods so when I find something I can actually eat I have a tendency to buy a case.  Simply put, these are great.  They have a wonderful, soft texture with a mildly sweet (but not too sweet) flavor.  For anyone with allergies or intolerances like myself, they're a real lifesaver.  They're satisfying, nicely packaged, and very fresh tasting.  I'll be buying more.

review/summary: Special ingredient in Southern cooking
review/text: If you're not familiar with this brand of mayonnaise, your missing a key ingredient to many dishes in southern food.  It has a distinct flavor that no other mayo has come close to, and one of the biggest selling brands of mayo in North & South Carolina.  It brings a zing to coleslaw, potato salad, tuna salad, egg salad, chicken salad, etc.  Basically, anything that calls for mayo in the recipe, Duke's works great in!  Ask any Carolinian what their favorite mayo is, and the answer will be Duke's.  Now that I live in the Midwest, I was tickled pink to have a taste of the south at home again!  If you order it in bulk (like I did), then make sure you store the extra in a cool, dark place until needed; otherwise, separation may occur, and the flavor can change.

review/text: I love Indian food and when I discovered Patak's cooking sauces it al-lowed me have delicious Indian food at home with very little effort.  I am am able to get 3 or 4 dinners out of one jar container.<br /><br />Korma is one of my favorite sauces.  I use the paste as the base and add the following ingredients: coconut milk, cilantro, garlic, nuts, and raisins  I typically make either chicken or lamb cut up in small pieces.  I also often add vegetable into the same pan, potatoes and onions work very well.  Sometimes I also like adding broccoli, cauliflower or chickpeas for variety.<br /><br />The best price for this sauce I found in a local Indian store.  They have a very large variety of Patak's sauces: different flavors and dif-ferent hotness. I usually buy a large variety and store unopened jars in the basement. They keeps very well for a long time.<br /><br />I have tried a variety of Indian cooking sauces and Patak's is my favorite.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Its like drinking battery acid
review/text: I'd give this negative stars if I could. After steeping according to directions I ended up with a pot of tea that had a very bitter, chemical taste, so i threw that batch out. I tried again, steeping it as you would a green tea, 175 degrees less than 1 minute. This was drinkable, but not good. The taste was very astringent, somewhat bitter. I actually got a sore throat from drinking it. I then tried blending small amounts of it with other teas. I tried 1/2 tsp silver yin with 2 tsp gyokuro, the green was completely overpowered by the white. Threw that batch out as well. Then I tried blending 1/2 tsp silver yin with 2 tsp monkey picked oolong. The result was okay, but then I went to the bathroom. My urine smelled like burnt plastic!?!?!?!? It was so bad that I actually searched the house to find the source of the chemical fire. It was the next time I went that I realized where the odor was coming from. I've never experienced anything like that before. Bottom line, I probably won't be purchasing ANY teavana products again.

Cheaper white teas from other brands are much better. Rishi, H&S, and numerous other tea companies have better white tea. In all honesty, this tastes worse than bagged tea. Teavana has some good products, but they are just too overpriced.<br /><br />Did I mention how horrible Teavana's customer service is? They don't respond to emails,etc. You have to wait on the phone for hours. Simply unacceptable. Feel free to check their facebook wall to see customers voicing the same concern.

review/text: We LOVE Tone's Ground Cinnamon. We use it in a graham cracker recipe that we make and the flavor is amazing. It smells great, too.<br /><br />I like that the container has both a sifter side and a side for measuring with spoon.<br /><br />This is a LARGE container and it will last you for a very long time. It is a great value, too!

review/text: I purchased 2, one is like the picture, the package is full of Cinnamon.<br />The other one, for a strange reason, has about 20% less, so I'm disappointed.<br />The quality is good, 3 stars just for the problem of the diference of "oz" between the two packages. I think will depend of lucky. Good luck for you!

review/summary: Great cinnamon
review/text: We normally buy this cinnamon and brand at Sam's, but we have moved and we don't have transportation to get there anymore. We always use cinnamon in our coffee for flavoring. When we are on diets we use this and stay away from the flavored creamers to cut calories and carbs. When we ran out of cinnamon, we panicked! My husband came up with the novel idea that Amazon might have it!!<br /><br />When the bottle got here, we immediately used it in our coffee and found no difference between the one at Sam's and the one sold here. They both taste identical. I read one reviewer that said that it seemed to thicken when liquid was added, and they thought it wasn't pure cinnamon. Now, I can't tell you if anything's been added or not, but I will tell you this. I noticed after I have added the coffee and 1/2 and 1/2, that I have to really stir it a lot to try to get the cinnamon to all dissolve. Normally I can't get it all to dissolve, no matter how much stirring I do. So whether this is just a normal trait of cinnamon, or a result of added ingredients; I can't tell you one way or the other.<br /><br />However, the taste is great and we still use it!

review/summary: Sprinkle On, Cholesterol Warriors
review/text: A sprinkle atop your oatmeal, a pinch to a cake batter, dashes in your coffee filter before you fill it with coffee grounds. Tone's Ground Cinnamon can enhance the flavor of some of the simplest dishes. But do you know the health benefits of this sweet spice?<br /><br />Perhaps you've consumed one too many cheeseburgers and are on medication to lower your cholesterol. It's common knowledge that oatmeal will help lower it as well, so fill up. Aside from making that bowl of plain oats edible, Tone's Ground Cinnamon will help your bad cholesterol go down. So sprinkle on, cholesterol warriors. Sprinkle on.<br /><br />You're probably hungry from easing up on the cheeseburgers, and let's be honest: oatmeal isn't that filling. But did you know Tone's Ground Cinnamon helps stave off hunger? Just a pinch here and there will keep it at bay, until you binge on a double bacon cheeseburger and wonder why your doctor is angry about your lab results.<br /><br />There's only so much you can do in the struggle for low cholesterol and losing weight. Include a bottle of Tone's Ground Cinnamon in that struggle.<br /><br />And sprinkle on, cholesterol warriors. Sprinkle on.

review/summary: BPA no longer an issue
review/text: ****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months.  Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best.  It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself.  The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy...  and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well.  All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read the review about BPA in the lids.  I spent some time trying to verify this myself.  A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me:  Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids...  their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question.  The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss.  That's only slightly paraphrased.  Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either...  nothing.  I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents...  something.  Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns...  just say something...  anything.  Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain.  Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review.  Their office was closed...  9AM - 7PM est.  Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />***UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.

They include a 1-800 number if people have further questions: please feel free to contact us at 1-800-434-4246, Monday through Friday from 7AM - 5PM Mountain Time.<br /><br />I don't know why they don't advertise this on the packaging, website, etc. It would reassure a lot of parents!

review/text: I have been very pleased with this variety pack of baby food. The pack contains three each of pears, peaches oatmeal banana, apples and apricots, and peaches bananas and raspberries. My 6 1/2 month old daughter loves all of them, especially the peaches bananas and raspberries! I have been very satisfied with Earth's best with one exception. The metal lids have a lining that contains BPA (as do ALL lids on glass babyfood jars), so if you're set on staying away from BPA, you'll want to get your baby food from companies that make pouches, like HappyBaby and Plum Organics. I make a lot of my own babyfood, so I feel that feeding her SOME food from glass jars is acceptable, especially for varieties that I can't make. I do also buy a lot of HappyBaby, and I'm very satisfied with the quality there also. All in all though, a very nice variety of good tasting fruits!

review/summary: BPA in lids!!!
review/text: I was disappointed to find out that the LIDS of Earth's Best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains BPA :(<br />I thought I was avoiding the whole BPA issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. If it's in the lids, it's going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. I was planning on being a devoted Earth's Best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then I found out about the BPA. As a note, if BPA doesn't bother you, most of Earth's Best food is tasty.

review/summary: Best Baby Food by Far, but we have some allergies with this one.
review/text: Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Fruit Variety Pack<br />Normally I would say this is a great idea, but I wasn't a fan of this particular variety. My son would have been just fine with it, but unfortunately for us at this point my daughter is allergic to raspberries and mangos. These are both things I think she'll grown out of, but something you may want to consider when purchasing this item. I would suggest trying an individual serving of one from your local store to see if your child has an allergy, but if they don't I would say buy it! Other than that I do think it's a great variety for kids who need some changing up occasionally. Also, the subscription price on this variety is great and can be altered depending on how soon you need it. We ended up running through another subscription we had and were able to have another shipped as soon as we needed it.

review/text: Just off the phone with them (Aug/12) and they said that yes they stopped putting BPA in the liners in Oct/11. Of course there is old stock on the shelves so I asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the "old" (with BPA) or the "new" (without BPA) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid. If it is all white then it is BPA free - if it is metallic or gold then it's the "old" lids which did contain a BPA layer. Thought this might help some of you out there!

review/text: I am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible. We used many of the Earth's Best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them. What I found irritating though was how runny many of the flavors were; I often had to add oatmeal or rice just to keep the food on the spoon.  Water is added to many if not most of the flavors. I wondered if that was a necessity however "Plum" "Ella's Kitchen" and "Happy Baby" brands (also organic) do not have water as an added ingredient. We definitely used these, but to be honest, I prefered the other brands because I felt we were getting a better value considering we weren't paying for water in those packages.

review/summary: Best every day price
review/text: With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there's a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.<br /><br />Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I'll probably always keep a few jars of Earth's Best to get by in a pinch.

review/text: we make our own fruits and veggies to use at home or at daycare.  however, storing them while we travel is challenging so we use the earths best on trips.  the flavor is wonderful, the ingredients are simple and organic and we feel good giving this to our 7 month old.  she loved all of the flavors in this variety pack so much that we are trying to replicate them at home.  we also keep these in the pantry as back up.

review/summary: Best Baby Food out there if you're not making your own!
review/text: I am loving Earth's Best brand overall.  I set out with the goal of making all of our son's food.  However, when I returned to work full time the puree time was less.  So my go-to backup is Earth's Best Baby Food.  We're on stage two now, almost stage 3, and he loves them.  I appreciate the no added sugars / preservatives and that it's mostly organic.  He loves the taste and combos.  Good stuff, great product, LOVE IT!

review/summary: Not completely BPA Free!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I just called up customer service and found that since October 2011, all the jars are BPA free. BUT...the jars manufactured before October,2011 are still available in the market. Usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed. So the jars with BPA lining on the lids are still floating around in the market. The consumers cannot tell the difference. So what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is BPA free or not??? This is very very disappointing from earth's best.

review/text: I usually feed Earth's Best baby food to my grandson. He has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food I have given him. This is the first time I have tried this particular variety pack. I fed him the Peach Oatmeal Banana and Apples and Apricots for breakfast this morning. Shortly after I noticed he was scratching. I looked and he had a rash. I remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so I checked and yes it is this variety pack. I don't know what is in it that would cause this type of reaction. Unfortunately I fed him two different jars so I don't know which one caused it but I don't want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go. Just thought I would let others know.

review/summary: addictive--creates instant party dip in one step
review/text: I actually got on Amazon to order some jars to ship out as Christmas presents but at the time of this review there is a shipping price per seller and it's currently not available via Prime...so I'm headed back to H.E.B. where I bought this last night to buy some and ship em out cheaper in some gift baskets.<br /><br />I'm not typically one to send food for the holidays but this is different. Put this over a block of cream cheese or vegan cream cheese if you are on a special diet for an instant party appetizer that is better than one that took you hours to cook and has to stay hot. I had slices of french bread and crackers and a knife to spread it with and this was the highlight of the evening.<br /><br />Now, trying to describe it is a whole other thing. You can't do this justice with a description. You get the sweet from the pineapple in almost a jelly base but the pineapple was roasted first to not only bring out the flavor, but a wonderful smoky flavor that's completely different than anything you've ever had before. Even if you've had roasted pineapple, that cool sweetness mixed with a slight heat of habanero (it's not overpowering by any means) is what makes all the difference.<br /><br />Another idea? Mix with stone ground mustard and serve with pretzel sticks for something way better than honey mustard.

review/text: These mushrooms are SO full of flavor!  Just add a handful to about a cup of very hot water and cover for about 20  minutes.  The broth they create after rehydrating is so rich.  It doesn't take alot of these to enhance anything you're cooking, from stews, to soups to sauces.  The jars are also great for storing them until they're gone.  NOTE:  Be sure to swish any dried mushrooms well, in the liquid, because there can be grit in dried mushrooms.  Let it settle to the bottom after you've rehydrated them and leave it behind when you pour off the broth.

I only use pure vanilla and although it is more expensive than imitation vanilla, it is by far more flavorful.  Most brands add sugar, but this one does not.  Any sugar comes from the alcohol which is 35%.  When you open this bottle of vanilla you can immediately smell the aroma of the beans which is very potent.  I found this vanilla in a market while visiting Florida.  I have not been able to find it in New Jersey.  So, I went to Amazon, where I can find almost anything and there it was!  I highly recommend this vanilla if you are a vanilla lover.

review/summary: Loved in this house!
review/text: I have one cat that is totally all things Whiskas!  I bought her a bag of this on a whim and gave it to her the same time I gave her some wet food.  It was quite amusing to see her go from one bowl to the next, trying to decide which to eat first!  She grabbed some wet, went to this, went back grabbed more wet, back to this, it was quite comical!  She loves the taste of this dry food, however, it's terribly hard for her to eat it.  The kibble is quite large and I'm trying to figure out if the makers thought they were making this for dogs!  She mostly has to swallow it whole unless I put some in a plastic baggy and whack it with a hammer.  They're just too stiff to snap in half with your fingers.<br /><br />Other than that, I do recommend this, but if your cat has a small mouth like mine, you might want to try something else.  She likes it so much that I keep giving it to her, but I'm still trying to find ways to help her eat it.
