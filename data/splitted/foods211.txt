Since digging deeper into the ingredients I have decided to switch to a much "healthier" alternative called ULTIMA replenisher with NO ARTIFICIAL COLORS, FLAVORS OR SWEETENERS.

review/summary: It's Alive!!!
review/text: We bought 6 very small "on sale" azalea bushes last year.  They made it through last summer and winter without dying and that was about it.  This spring, as everything around was turning green and lush, these little bushes were pretty sad looking and very brittle.  No flowers and brown looking leaves.  In fact, they almost looked like they were dead.  My husband (better known as Eeyore) was sure that they were as good as dead, said that fertilizer would never work, and was getting ready to pull them up and go buy some that were already large and healthy looking--and also very expensive.  I said, hold everything--before we give up, let me look online and see if there is something we can do to save these.<br /><br />I read a review here and some at epinions on Miracid azalea/camellia/rhodedendron food. I then promised him if this didn't work, we could pull up those plants and start over.<br /><br />Thank you to all of you who wrote reviews here and elsewhere.  I want to add my own recommendation.  Because--unbelievably, within two days after feeding, the first flowers were peeking out.  It is now not even a full week later and all 6 bushes have flowers and/or buds.  I counted at least 22 buds on one bush alone.  My nay-saying husband first said that it was a coincidence but now he is talking about feeding them every couple of weeks!!  I think he has become a believer.  Me too--I never did tell him but I really thought those bushes were probably dead, too.<br /><br />Really amazing stuff!

review/summary: good for more than you think
review/text: I have been using this fertilizer for years on the recommended plants.  But this year I decided to try it on some other plants that typically you would not use this on.<br />I live in an area that gets lots of freezes and frosts and some occasional snow, though not heavy.  I also am a devoted lover of geraniums and I like to have them growing in hanging pots. But they will not withstand the winters here, so I winter them over in the greenhouse and bring them out when they are safe from frost. When they come out they always have suffered dieback of some of the branches, sometimes a lot depending on the winter.  So, this year, I decided to try giving them the miracle grow for acid loving plants instead of general purpose miracle grow.  It made a huge difference.  I fed them this several times until the foliage came back, and boy did it come back.  They are much more lush and green and as a result have more branches to produce buds.  After which I switched back to general purpose miracle grow.  I decided to try the same procedure on other plants not previously treated this way, such as roses and it produced the same results.  Then of course I switched back to regular rose food.  I even tried it on my tomatoes right after transplanting them from the greenhouse to the ground.  It gave them a boost during the transition from greenhouse to outdoors, without trying to get them to produce blooms.  It has been a boon to my tomatoes.  They made the transition seamlessly.

review/text: If you have azaleas (which are actually part of the genus rhododendron) this is the product for you. In Chinese culture, the azalea is known as "thinking of home bush" (xiangsi shu) which makes sense because when I think of home I remember the azaleas in my yard and I feel better. I have a crazy-looking azalea in my backyard. It's been there for at least 20 years. It looks like a bonzai--it's all bend over and stretched out and narly. I put some Miracid on it and Jeez the awesom blooms I got this year! It was wicked cool! Thanks Miracid! You're the best!

review/text: Bear Creek Darn Good Chili Mix is just that - darn good! The instructions to turn this mix into chili or dip are clear and concise, and include suggestions for "doctoring" it up. Following the directions to the letter will result in a meatless (but not vegetarian - read the ingredient list) chili that is flavorful but not too spicy. I especially love the variety of beans included. My suggestion for perfect chili: add a half pound of spicy turkey sausage (mild is too sweet) and a half pound of lean ground beef. Brown the meat first then add water as indicated on the package (don't increase or decrease the water measure) and follow the directions from there. Yum!

I made it according to directions, and threw in some browned hamburger. The smell filled the room, as it boiled, and simmered.  I was not disappointed, with the way it tasted.  I don't like my chili spicey, and this one fit the bill exactly, as it has just the right amount of spices and herbs. I have tried a lot of chili, in a lot of places, and I will say that this is  the best MIX that I have ever tried. I would definitely recommend this for camping trips.  The 9.8 ounce bag, says that it makes 8 servings, but depending on how hungry your crew is, might only feed four.

review/summary: "Darn Good" Chili Kicked Up
review/text: Bear Creek "Darn Good" Chili is some of the best chili I've ever had. It is quick and easy by just following the instructions on the back of the packet. My family enjoys chili just a little spicier and a little meatier so I've added a few items to kick the chili up another notch. So here it is....<br /><br />(2) packs of Bear Creek "Darn Good" Chili Mix<br />(2) cans of Tomato Paste<br />(2) cans of Rotel Tomatoes<br />(2) Small Onions (Chopped)<br />(1) Bellpepper (Chopped)<br />(4) cloves of Garlic (Chopped)<br />(1.5) lbs. of Ground Beef or Ground Chuck<br />(2) lbs. of Smoked Sausage (Finely Chopped)<br />Hint of Cayenne Pepper (To your taste)<br />Hint of liquid smoke<br /><br />In a large pot, add both chili mixes to boiling water (As directed), then add the tomato paste. Stir well and turn fire down to a medium heat. In a large sauce pan, brown your ground beef and chopped sausage, then add to your pot. In the same large sauce pan, saute chopped onion, bellpeppers, and garlic (10-15 min) and then add to your pot. Add the Rotel Tomatoes, turn heat down to a simmer and let cook about 30 minutes (Stirring occasionally). Add cayenne pepper to taste and a hint of Liquid Smoke and let simmer for about 30 more minutes (Still stirring). In this last few minutes while the chili is cooking,  bake up your favorite cornbread (I like "Jiffy"). Gather your family and friends for a "Darn Good" Chili time.<br /><br />Recipe is even better in a CrockPot.....And I don't know why I added the Liquid Smoke (But it worked)<br /><br />Hope ya like it!!!

For the Chili I add 1 can of green chili and diced tomato and a can of tomato paste with a couple of soup can's of water, I think I used 4.  I also added some precooked hamburger and red pepper as well.  Great thing is you can add what you like and this soup tastes great and you can make it thicker or soupier what ever you desire.  I took it to a pot luck and it was gone in no time.  I am a repeat buyer of this mix and will purchasing more in the near future.

review/summary: Oh my gosh, so darn good!
review/text: I recently discovered Darn Good Chili Mix at a local store.  It is tasty just using the directions on the bag, which is just the chili mix, water, and a can of tomato paste.  It makes roughly 8 cups of chili, which is enough for the 3 adults in our family.  If you're following the new 2011 Weight Watchers plan, 1 cup of chili is 2 points when made according to those directions.<br /><br />However, I like it better as a base for my own chili.  Here is how I make it:<br /><br />2 lbs of ground sirloin (90% lean)<br />1 lbs of ground venison (or substitute more ground beef)<br />1 large sweet onion, chopped<br />2 large green peppers, chopped<br />5 or 6 heaping teaspoons of fresh minced garlic (I use the jarred garlic that needs refrigerated)<br /><br />Toss all of the above in a large skillet, and cook over medium heat until meat is done.  Drain any grease and sit aside.<br /><br />In a large pot, add 14 cups of water.  Bring to a boil.<br /><br />Whisk in 2 bags of Darn Good Chili Mix, and 2 cans of tomato paste.  Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes.<br /><br />After 15 minutes, add:<br />15 oz can dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed<br />15 oz can light red kidney beans, drained and rinsed<br />28 oz can of diced tomatos<br />28 oz can of Rotel tomatoes<br />Meat mixture<br /><br />Stir together and continue to simmer for another 20 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes.<br /><br />This makes a lot of chili.  My 8 1/2 quart pot was nearly full.  I always make extra chili so I can freeze part of it for a future meal.

review/text: This is sooo tasty and very low in calories.  So many low cal foods don't have much flavor but this one has both.  I made a couple of changes - because I love the flavor of tomatoes I decreased the water from 7 cups to 6 cups and added a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes to the water.  I also added a can of black beans (drained)to it.  I was trying to keep the calories down so didn't add meat but imagine that would be good also.  Try it....

review/text: We've been eating this for years. In fact since before they changed the name. It was originally named with a three letter word (similar to darn) that Amazon won't let me write. We've tried quite a number of variations of this and it always turns out good. Sausage works well. Add cream cheese, sour cream, cheddar cheese, or bacon when serving. We only buy from Amazon as they have the best pricing so sometimes we have to wait for stock but it's worth the wait. When we don't want to make it from scratch or just want smaller batches this is the way to go. YUM!

But one cold day, I was wondering through the grocery while craving something different, so I grabbed a bag.  Like most reviewers here, I thought I'd add a few ingredients.  A can of spicy rotel, some seasoned ground chuck, a little onion.  Other than that, I followed the directions and added a couple extra cups of water (I like my chili a little soupy, probably not recommended for most).  Wow!  I was floored.  My son was ready to report me to child services for making him eat chili, but one taste and he was just as impressed as I was and didn't even complain when we hit the left-overs the next day.  Bear Creek did a really nice job on this one, I'll have to try their others.

I have never added to it, I just stick to the tomato paste, water and mix. Sometimes I add a bit of shredded cheese (if I feel like spending the points ;-) ) and it's just delicious.<br /><br />It's got lots of fiber, is just the right amount of spicy, and every bite is full of yum. Even though I'm watching what I eat for weight loss, to be honest sometimes I just want to stuff my face, and this fits the bill. It's tasty, it's good for me, and it's filling.

I usually go for 3 hours.<br /><br />I've officially stopped buying canned chili since stumbling across this at the store! I would recommend this to any chili fan for when you're to lazy to do it from scratch. Seems pricey here on Amazon though since i've bought mine for $4 a pack average at most stores such as Wal-Mart & WinCo.

review/text: For those who need some darn good chili fast, here's the answer. This stuff is very open to doctoring and I highly recommend adding at least 12oz of ground beef. Not a huge fan of the rice but I found it to be hardly noticeable. It's a mild chili, so for spice add either cayenne powder or chili powder. About two TBL of cayenne powder whisked in added a nice additional kick for my batch. The alternate recipe on the back of the bag calls for chopped tomatoes but I feel they are unnecessary. My additions were toppings; sweet onions and shredded cheddar. Usually skip the sour cream in favor of ice cream for dessert. Knocks out heat real quick.

review/summary: Truly is the best Darn Good Chili Mix you can buy.....
review/text: Tried this on a whim today and so impressed I'm writing a review - which isn't something I often do. Love it!! I made the broth according to package directions and then added 1 can of "Chili" Rotel, 1 cup of picante sauce, 1/2 bottle of beer (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale), 1 pound of browned ground turkey and some fresh garlic. Topped my bowl off with just a small dollop of fat free sour cream and oh my goodness this was absolutely the BEST mix chili I've ever tried. Loved the variety of beans, the rice, the flavor - and SOOOO easy - and quick!!

review/summary: Good Stuff!!!
review/text: I use this product as a base for my own chile.  I follow their receipt but:  Brown about 1.5 Lbs of ground beef with 2 medium chopped onions and 2 or 3 cloves of fresh garlic (or more to taste) in the bottom of the chile pot. Instead of adding water, use Beef Stock.  Add 2 cans of drained different color kidney beans (like Red & Black).  Add 1 large can of diced tomatoes (including juices).  Add 1 extra small can of tomato paste.  Add Chile Powder to taste (I like mine spicy so I add 5 or 6 Tbs).  Let it simmer until it thickens (could be several hours) and enjoy!!!!

I didn't tell my SO there was no meat in it and thought it was awesome.  Couldn't believe the very low calories and high fiber.  A definite keeper and will be a staple in my pantry!

review/summary: Great meal & easy!
review/text: Was thrilled to find this mix on Amazon.  My mom has been buying it for me when she can find it, but that's not always easy.  I add a bit of cooked ground beef or shredded chicken (I always keep some ready in the freezer for times like this), a can of diced tomatoes and a couple of undrained cans of beans (dark red kidney & pinto last night).  I cook uncovered for longer than the directions say, as it is less watery and more flavorful that way, I think.  My five-year-old daughter simply loves the soup and has thanked me no less than a dozen times in the fifteen hours since dinner.  We've got plenty of leftovers, with a dozen hearty one-cup servings (I measured).  And to my surprise, only 3 Weight Watchers points!  Next time I'm going to try adding broccoli cut into small pieces, (maybe even shredded spinach) to add even more nutrition.  Yum!!!

review/summary: THE.BEST.
review/text: I tried Bear Creek's Hot and Sour soup a few years ago and my daughter enjoyed it.  While shopping a few weeks ago, I decided to buy a bag of the Darn Good Chili because it appeared easy to prepare.  Without a doubt, it was THE.BEST.  I dropped some off at my son's house and he called to tell me how delicious it was and asked why I never prepared it while he was growing up!<br /><br />I added browned chopped meat and hot pepper.  Next time I think I'll add some frozen corn and turkey sausage and serve it stuffed pepper style!  What a great product!

review/summary: What it is....
review/text: As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying "fresh" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh.

I have given one to every tea loving person I know and they ALL loved it!<br /><br />I rarely drink any tea but Numi anymore.

review/summary: You can taste the difference
review/text: I have been a herbal tea drinker for many years and when I try a new brand I expect to be disappointed.  Numi's Moroccan Mint Tea is fresh tasting with full-bodied flavor and a clean finish.<br />I love that the tea bags are fully organic, not just organic tea in a synthetic bag.  What I also love is that if you are brewing your mug of tea and the phone rings, or you are distracted by something, when you come back the taste of the tea is just as fresh and delicious.  I can't wait to brew this for iced tea next summer!  I just had surgery and was queasy afterwards and Numi Moroccan Mint tea was the only thing that tasted good, and it also settled my stomach.  Recently, I left a box on the counter when I went on vacation and when I returned my sister, who was sitting my dog, asked, "Where can we get more Moroccan Mint tea?"  Another convert.  Whether you buy it here or in a local store, "taste the difference."  I certainly did!  I will now try some of the other Herbal Teasans.

I only use one teaspoon of sugar to add sweetness as this tea is naturally tangy-sweet.<br /><br />The only drawback is the price.  This is the kind of tea I'll reserve for guests, or as fillers for Christmas stockings for my tea-drinking friends.

I have to say this one has a much more mellow taste and the price is far better. I have taken to having a cup after dinner and it makes for a very enjoyable evening experience. I normally sweeten it with a teaspoon or two of light organic agave nectar. It just takes the taste over the top. I initially thought a six pack would be overkill but after having a few cups I see that I am going to breeze through my supply relatively quickly.

review/text: I'm challenging myself to give up soda 100% this year, but I needed something with flavor to replace it. After searching online for Tea reviews, I decided to give this tea a try. I just made the first batch of Iced Tea and it's FANTASTIC!!! The tea has a clean, crisp taste and you can definitely taste the mint!! It's not overpowering but it's definitely there! I used 3 teabags , steeped it in a 2 quart pan full of hot water, added a teaspoon of sugar and let it sit. The tea really is very delicious, and leagues better than the yucky pre-made tea I've been buying at work. The tea is a bit naturally sweet, but it needed a teeny bit of sugar.<br /><br />I'm so pumped! Here's to a healthier 2012 with Numi.<br /><br />P.S. amazon prime rocks.

It is delicious, and my favorite mint tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "In the Moroccan spring, the snow melts off the Atlas Mountains, watering the plains below. As the days warm, some of the most soothing, refreshing and full-flavored mint flourishes in this ancient land of the Berbers. With a flavor as light and lively as a newly picked leaf, our choice organic mint will become your favorite mint teasan. An all-day or after-dinner delight, no wonder the Moroccans drink ten cups a day."<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry.

It's just that you could break a tooth if you tried to chew on them right out of the package. I am thinking they are probably just old stock and fresh ones would be chewy and lovely. The flavor is good and they are adorable.

review/summary: Solid In Olive Oil -- Sort Of
review/text: I first got introduced to StarKist Tuna Fillet Gourmet In Olive Oil, when I purchased several cans from a big name "Mart". I was impressed by the tuna being packed in Olive Oil. The solid tuna was slightly darker than solid white Albacore, but had a good taste and apparently contains less trace mercury than the solid white tuna. When I went back to the "Mart", the item was no longer offered, so I turned to Amazon. I ordered two cases of 12 cans per case. When I finally received the cans, I found that the amount of Olive Oil and tuna grade were very inconsistent.<br />Either there was a small amount of oil along with a lot of water or there was very little liquid at all. The can's label does not list water as an ingredient. Some cans had fillets, while others had a mash of small tuna chunks. I probably will not order another case of this brand again.

review/summary: Good tuna, good deal
review/text: I feel this is quite tasty tuna at a reasonable price.  I agree that the texture of the contents isn't completely consistent, sometimes solid fillets, other times less so, but still far from "chunk style".  I have found no water in there.  This tuna is vastly less salty than, say, Progresso.

review/summary: Best Tuna I've Ever Used:  Please Make It Available Again
review/text: I love this tuna.  It tastes great and is packed in olive oil, which is a big plus for those of us who like flavor.  I wanted to order more today, but it apparently isn't being sold because some people had complained about it.  I read the reviews from some disgruntled (probably overly picky) people who were upset about the consistency of the tuna.  While it may be that you don't always get a solid chunk of tuna or sometimes it's packed a little looser than other times, you still get a whole can of tuna instead of a fourth of a can of flaked tuna and three quarters of water like the regular cans.  I am really bummed that I can't order this right now because of the complainers of the world.  If you don't like it, nobody forces you to order it.  I hope Amazon has the good business sense to make this available again as soon as possible.

review/text: I just finished my first can of this. Delicious! I have been looking for a tuna packed in olive oil. Found this & bought it. Was $1.48 per can at meijers. The olive oil was evoo(extra virgin olive oil), & adds an enhanced flavor to the tuna. The tuna pieces were larger & not all smooshed like I usually find in tuna packed in water. It tends to be a little drier than the stuff in water as well. But I like that. I don't like drippy sandwiches & I always get that from tuna in water. No matter how long I leave the tuna in the mesh strainer. I,just had my sandwich with a light brushing of miracle whip, put the tuna on, topped of with another slice of bread & ate it. Sooo goood!!!!! I do not place the tuna in a bowl & mix with miracle whip because even with lightly folding in the salad dressing it still smooshes the tuna. And I like the bigger pieces. I am,going back tomorrow & get some more!

review/text: This tuna is quite tasty, and the packaging is more convenient than any other brand I've seen. The cans have pull tabs -- very easy to open. Also they are 4.5 oz, which is just about the right size for one generous serving, small enough that I don't feel the need to discard the olive oil in order to cut the calories. By the way, olive oil pack is the way to go -- it makes a nice combination with the relatively dry tuna. At the price, an excellent value. I'm very pleased and intend to buy this again.

review/text: This is very good quality tuna fillet and is superior to other national brands tuna in olive oil. The olive oil is not of the best quality but you can drain it and just enjoy the tuna with little olive oil. The best use is to make a salad with iceberg lettuce and tomatoes and then just add a little vinegar.

review/text: I ordered these not knowing how good or bad they really were. They are amazing, incredible, delicious, and pretty good as well. The amaretto is injected by needle into two distinct bands that run the length of the cake, so the distribution is even and balanced. The cake itself is very good, reminiscent of a handmade pound cake of many years ago, before that horrible mess the grocery stores sell as 'pound cake' became the norm. Excellent flavor, texture, and moistness. Recommended without hesitation, UNLESS you are on a diet, in which case ordering this is akin to total surrender.

Each friend had a significat amount of dried fruit left and I was initially surprised when I visited the first friend and saw fruit remaining. "Well, the first friend explained, this fruit just wasn not as good as most dried fruit so I haven't eaten it all yet. I tasted an apricot. Dried apricots generally have a nice tangy flavor even after a year. No flavor. I visited the next friend and the same basic scenario was repeated. Either I got two bad batches of fruit, or this company is just not up to snuff.

I used pork Char Siu in with it, and that was fine, as I said, I am a big fan of NOHs Char Siu, but this stuff was about useless.<br /><br />I added extra Teriyaki sauce, just to give the rice some flavor, and it actually got better tasting the 2nd day.  I am going to try this again with about 2 cups of rice, just to see if its better in a smaller batch. I mean I got 11 more pouches of this stuff, I gotta find some use for it.

review/text: I love this rice!  It truly is "tender and delicious" as stated on the package.  Keep in mind that even though it is a product of California, this is a Japanese-style brown rice, thus more polished than American-style brown rice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a few months after posting this review I have had some  bad batches of this rice, regardless of the place of purchase (I tried a nearby Japanese food store as well as a mail-order Korean store).  I also had that experience when buying it already cooked (as part of the bento lunches at a nearby Japanese cafe). It is as if the rice is on its way to being rancid.  If anyone knows what the problem is and how to recognize it before I buy a pack, please let me know because when it is good, it is outstanding.

For an easy vegan meal replacement, it does the trick, and the price is good. I'll try the vanilla next, as that might mix well with some fruit in the blender.

review/summary: gym rat bargain!
review/text: Great flavor, low in calories, high in nutrients, high in protein! Usually protein powders are high priced and high in calories, this one is a great bargain and tastes great, I highly recommend for the lady gym rats, probably not "macho" enough for guys since it is soy based...

review/summary: Great Product for Busy Mom's
review/text: Great for when you are in too much of a hurry to cook breakfast or make a lunch.  The flavor is rich and chocolatey, add a bannana, a cup of 2% milk, blend it up and you are good to go.
