Ummm...it wasn't on the list of ingredients! I tried it once and noticed it right away, picked up the box and there it is, sucralose. I threw this away, the bitter taste AND aftertaste isnt worth it. I don't care how much brown sugar they say they added, you cant put both together and expect a postive result.<br />Dont buy this unless you want a bitter taste and the sure to be in your near future-health problems with cancerous after effects of chlorinated fake sugar.....

review/text: I agree with Texas Mom and would recommend that you check your local Bed, Bath and Beyond. I was able to buy a box of 16 for about 10 dollars.<br /><br />You may also want to check out other online vendors. Most of them will sell the cider for list price. Most k-cups will average in price from about 50 cents to the high of 70 cents each. From this vendor, the cider k-cups are about $1.60 each, instead of .68 cents each from vendors like Bed, Bath and Beyond. I would recommend that you shop around for the best deal.

Really?  And when I purchased mine from Amazon (because I couldn't find them anywhere in town), they were about $30 for 24 k-cups (currently, they're at $24/24).  Compared to your other non-coffee options, the per-cup cost of these gems is just silly.  I realize they're a novelty, and apparently not carried in any retail store anywhere in North Texas-- but I can't make a habit of dropping thirty bucks on novelty beverages...

I expected a very fake and chemical tasting brew but was pleasantly surprised that I got neither! I was very happy to ready that there are no artificial ingredients in this one too! This is a great alternative for when you want something different from coffee and tea. If I had to point out anything bad about them, maybe that the flavor is almost too sweet? If you brew it on your smallest cup setting (mine is 5oz for the Keurig B60 Special Edition) it is a tad tooo strong but in the medium size offerning its just right.  I hate having to buy 2-packs though...

review/summary: Nice Aroma, Off Taste
review/text: The aroma while brewing was great, but the actual drink felt watered down. I recommend using the 2nd smallest brewing size on a Keurig Platinum - the taste was still a little off, but decent.<br /><br />I peeled the K-cup open after brewing to see the contents and it looked like apple sauce more or less. Keurig boasts that the cider is all natural with no artificial flavors or preservatives so I was curious. The ingredients however do list organic malic acid and Reb A, which is a stevia extract. I dislike any kind of substitute sweeteners, so that could be why the taste was off for me.<br /><br />For any Weight Watchers followers out there, each K Cup is 2 points because of the 20 grams of carbs.

I have tried a lot of coffee and hot chocolate, teas etc. Im not sure if its the kerig cups or the Kerug brewer but these apple cider k cups never come out quite right. Once in a while ill get one that tastes ok. But mostly they taste like apple water. Ive tried them in other relatives brewers and have the same results. Ive tried shaking the k cup up before brewing to loosen the granules. Its like drinking flavored water. Id stick to the packages next time they are much more flavorful and much less expensive.

review/summary: A nice winter warm-up
review/text: I purchased these as a change-up to our inventory of teas, coffees and cocoas my wife and I drink during the cold winter months.<br /><br />I've read other reviews regarding price. Although I won't include price into my rating, I will say that an item is only worth whatever someone will pay for it. As for these, I waited until Amazon had a sale and pulled the trigger. I got them for around $.75/k-cup.<br /><br />As for the cider k-cups themselves, I am pleased with them overall.  As with some of the cocoa k-cups, the larger setting on the Keurig machine produces a more watery result but this doesn't seem to affect the hot cider flavor as much as it does the hot cocoa.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, I'd compare the largest setting flavor to a green tea. Light and not overpowering, but the flavor is there.<br />With the smaller Keurig settings, the cider has a more robust flavor and is perfect for being creative and mixing in other things. My personal favorite is a dash of cinnamon and a dribble of Irish wiskey.<br /><br />I'm giving this 4 stars because I think that these K-cup makers should be able to produce a K-cup that creates a consistent product at the larger Keurig settings, but I can't knock it too much because the lighter, more diluted tasing cider can be very enjoyable at times too.

review/text: I enjoyed a couple cups of this over the holidays, so I ordered two boxes for myself. The smell and taste are great, but I noticed that even though I really like the cider while I'm drinking it, I feel nauseous after every cup. Apparently, this is a common side effect of stevia. I typically don't use sugar-replacement sweeteners. so I wasn't familiar with stevia or that it wouldn't agree with me. Such a pity that Green Mountain had to add it because the cider would have been nice and tart with just the brown sugar and apples. Guess I'll have to go back to just coffee and tea. Too bad.

The taste is great, but don't stretch it too thin.  Standard mug size works well.  What's even better are the natural ingredients;  Dried apples, brown sugar, malic acid (good for you), and stevia (natural sweetener).  This is sure to be a winter staple at home.

(I made the large)  Added some light brown sugar, no change in sweetness or tartness.<br /><br />My wife said it tasted fine so maybe I'm just not a cider fan.  I could have sworn I've had it before and was fine with it - that and I'm a fan of every other apple based goods. (pies, juice, etc.)<br /><br />Probably won't buy again.

review/summary: Hot Apple Cider K-Cups
review/text: Very good taste if you like Apple Cider. Need to make this item in a spiced apple cider version. I try to look for less expensive places to buy this type of product, but what can I say, I am a fan of Amazon.com.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Just tried the Green Mountain Naturals Hot Apple Cider K-Cups for the first time and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!  The initial sip is very sweet, almost like biting into a tart green apple, but as soon as the liquid slides down your throat, there is a nice pleasant semi sweet aftertaste.  The smell is out of this world, it just screams "FALL"!!  The smell and taste make me feel as though I'm sitting on a porch swing of a country home watching the leaves change color and the kids play in the yard.<br /><br />The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is I think if I'm not totally in the mood for this, the initial sweet apple taste might bother me.  But overall I will purchase this again.<br /><br />I bought my K-cups from Bed Bath & Beyond, using my 20% off coupon, a 16-count for about $10.

review/summary: Smells Great, Tastes Good
review/text: I was really looking forward to trying these Hot Apple Ciders. When they finally came in season, I picked up a box. As soon as I received it, even though it was summer, I eagerly brewed my first cup.<br /><br />First off the cider SMELLS great. You can smell all of the spices in the cider that make cider taste good and it will make your kitchen smell amazing.<br /><br />I brewed my first mug with 8oz of water and found the flavor to be not as strong as the smell. I brewed subsequent mugs with 6 oz. of water and those tasted a bit stronger and were much more cider-y.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good cider, but I definitely recommend using less water to make sure you get to enjoy the nice cider flavor.

review/text: This Hot Apple Cider is really good, but sure is sweet.  If you don't like coffee, hot chocolate or tea, this is the perfect choice for you on a really cold night.  If you don't like sweet drinks, you can also "Irish It Up" if you choose to and it will tame down the sugary taste.  It's good either way.

review/summary: Perfect addition for your maker!
review/text: If you have read some of my other k-cup reviews, I am not a big coffee fan but I do love my Keurig maker! This tastes very good, but I have learned to make it on the middle or low setting as like most k cups, this tastes very watered down. I can't really taste the difference from store bought apple cider that you make in the microwave. I do however love the convince of the k-cups for my maker! This is a perfect treat on a cold winter or fall day, I also enjoy the apple flavor on a warmer spring or summer day!

review/summary: Superb Flavor- we just love it!
review/text: I went out on a limb and purchased one box of Green Mountain Hot Apple Cider and was pleasantly surprised! The flavor is right on- not overly sweet but just perfect, where I don't have to reach for my Splenda. There is a subtle cinnamon flavor to it which I just love and a "true" apple taste- not a fake taste by any means. This is the perfect drink for cold winter nights when I do not want a cup of hot coffee. I try to keep a few on "reserve" for my friends and family who do not enjoy coffee. I've yet to meet someone who does not enjoy this cider.  I highly recommend you try this. However, I purchase direct from Green Mountain- as the prices are far better than Amazon. Sorry Amazon- as much as I love you, I've got to shop where the deals are.

review/summary: Great flavor but take note of freshness date printed on the product.
review/text: I purchased this through Amazon Warehouse Deals. I bought two boxes for my mother. For $10 a package it was an excellent price. I understand these were returns to Amazon but it didn't look like it. It was in brand new unopened condition. I normally would give 5 stars except for one thing. The "best by" date listed July 30, 2012. I got it May 31, 2012. If it was 6 months I probably wouldn't worry but two months is a problem. So I dropped it to 3 stars. The price and the fact I still have two months saves it. I guess I will have to help my mom finish these off. Luckily they are pretty good. I may buy again from the seller since the price is good. Wish the "best by" could have been listed before I ordered.<br /><br />UPDATE (July 13, 2012) Bought again through Amazon but from  another seller, ezee llc (lindasproperties), for $17.10 per 24 pack. That was way more than my original order but my mom wanted more. Seeing it was close to the MSRP of $19.99, I was expecting to receive a product that had a better "best by" date. No, this time it was worse. The "best by" date is August 17, 2012. I have little over a month to go. Granted my mom will probably finish it within that time frame but this is unacceptable. I'm dropping the product rating to two stars due to unsatisfactory experiences with two different sellers. I should get at lest six months.<br /><br />UPDATE (October 24, 2012) I guess my mom goes through this quite quickly. I purchased through a seller on eBay for $17.95 per 24 pack on September 10, 2012. This time around I got a package that was well more than a year out for the "best by" date. So I guess I know now that this product actually has a good shelf life if purchased from a proper seller. I realize my star rating is harsh since it focuses on the seller not the product. The taste and flavor is excellent and I have definitely purchased and drank this multiple times when I am at my parents. I am going to bump the review to 5 out of 5 because the product itself is not at fault. Just buy it from a good seller.

review/summary: Apple Cider
review/text: I was really looking forward to the apple cider when I got my Keurig coffee pot but I found it to be a bit weaker than I thought it would be. I even checked every local store before buying this 24 pack on Amazon.<br /><br />I will say that I am glad that I tried it, but it wasn't what I thought it would be, though that's not to say it was bad either.<br /><br />I will be more than happy to drink this whole box of my cider, but I don't know if I will have an urge to purchase this again or not. I think I may stay with simply putting a packet of Alpine cider (those ones that can be found at most stores in the coffee, tea, and hot chocolate section) and just running some water through my coffee pot instead. It'll be a fraction of the cost personally as I can get 12 boxes with 10 packs each (120 packs all together) for about $10 through amazon, which is a lot cheaper for my wallet.

review/text: I am not a coffee drinker, but wanted the Keurig for the ease of offering coffee to clients.  I was excited to see this product and bought 24 (at about .75/cup).  I was incredibly excited when it was making it, as the smell was quite heavenly.  That said, and it may be that I didn't know what to expect, but the drink itself was nice but didn't quite match up to the incredible smell.  I will keep these stocked, but I doubt I will often reach for it over the Cocoa or Teas.  That said, it truly is almost worth making just to grab that wonderful smell!

review/text: These are among my favorite of the non-coffee Keurig K-cups.  The flavor is very nice: natural tasting, not too sweet, with just a hint of spice.  The aroma is likewise a good approximation of 'real' hot apple cider.  The one area that is lacking is, I think, unavoidable: as with the hot chocolates, this drink has no body.  While the aroma and taste is very good, it remains just flavored hot water.

review/summary: Great cider
review/text: The apple cider KCups from Green Mountain are delicious. It's just the warm drink needed after being outside in the winter.<br /><br />However, keep an eye on price. These are one of the more expensive K-Cups, and sometimes clock in at over $1 a cup. Keep an eye out at retail stores and online stores for the more reasonable $0.70/cup prices that sometimes crop up. It irks me to pay more than $.50 for a k-cup, but for a special treat like this cider, I will compromise... but not too much.<br /><br />NOTE: This product uses STEVIA as a sweetener. That's fine for me, but for those of you who taste Stevia as bitter, give this a pass.

review/text: My wife, kids and I liked this hot apple cider so much that we've practically gone through our first order of 24 in less than a week so I am reordering.  As opposed to some of the hot chocolate k-cups, you can set the Keurig for mug size and still get a good tasting cup.

review/summary: Natural cider in a k cup
review/text: I was impressed with this cider. Originally skeptical of apple cider in a k cup, this really doesn't disappoint. It's nice that the ingredients are natural. It tastes like a great apple cider you'd get from your local farm. Pours cloudy, not clear. Watch the price here though. I usually take a 20% off coupon into bed bath and beyond for my k cups. Comes out to about 8 bucks for 16 I believe.

review/summary: Very tasty and easy Hot Cider
review/text: I bought these for my wife who doesn't care for coffee, but loves cider and wanted something she could use in our new Keurig brewer. I'll have them on occasion too. They don't quite pack the flavor that fresh, local cider might have, but since these can be a year-round treat, they're very hand and very tasty.<br /><br />If I had to compare them to hot, fresh cider, they'd rate lower, but for what they are, I am extremely happy and would definitely recommend.

review/text: I have avoided the new coffee maker trap for a LONG time.  I had purchased a pod brewer and HATED it....could not even hardly give it away at my yard sale.  So I was done with "one cup at a time" brewers.  THEN I started taking my best friend to her dental appointments.  GUESS WHAT THEY HAVE?  A commercial Keurig and GUESS WHAT MY FAVORITE flavor is?  Yuppers, APPLE CIDER!  DARN IT ALL!!  GUESS WHAT I PURCHASED?  A Keurig!  Ok, I have purchased other K-Cups as well but am still waiting for my Keurig to get here.  For the time being I sit and stare at my box of hot cider and wait with eager anticipation.  Oh yes, THIS K-Cup flavor is DA BEST!  For a non-coffee that is.  And I agree with another reviewer who said there is no junky ingredients in these.  It's all good.  Now, if I only had the coffee maker!

review/summary: Much, much better than the Gevalia
review/text: The Starbucks t-discs are truly superior. While on the surface they might seem more expensive due to the fact that you get fewer discs, the discs contain about three times the coffee as do the Gevalia. Secondly, opening a newly used Gevalia and Starbucks t-disc revealed the Starbucks to be much dryer, making me thing they drain better and give a better extraction. The net result is a stronger and more flavorful cup.<br />  The only drawback is that they only make a few of their blends in this format. If they put their Sumatra, Italian Roast, espresso, and a few others in this format there would be no need to buy any other brand.

review/summary: RICH, FULL-BODIED TASTE
review/text: Really do love this coffee!  It has a rich, full bodied taste, not at all bitter despite its darkness but delicious!<br /><br /> As we're a bit new at using the T-discs, (we have a Bosch Tassimo, which by the way we really like) we were surprised to find that the Starbucks disc was twice as thick as our Carte Noire disc.  But, no problem whatsoever, the Starbucks disc was easily punctured and fit quite easily into the brewing unit.<br /><br /> As we're a two person household with only one often drinking coffee, the ability to brew only one cup of really good coffee is important to us.  On the other hand, the brewing is so speedy that if we want two cups or more it can be accomplished in a jif.<br /><br /> We will be looking forward to trying the other Starbucks flavors available in discs.<br /><br /> - Gail Cooke

review/summary: Better than the store
review/text: Although the Starbucks Verona discs aren't cheap, they are the best in-home Starbucks experience.  I used to make 3+ trips to Starbucks a day.  Now I don't.  Saves on gas $ not so much coffee $.  But what is great is that of all the Starbucks blends Verona is my favorite.  With all stores having Pikes Place blend 100% of the time, T-Discs are about the only way I can get Verona.  Until the Tassimo, home brewing never worked for me no matter how much money I spent on brewers, beans, water, etc.  Tassimo _does_ work.  Just be careful the T-Discs are fresh.  I've found that after about 3 months, they can become stale too, just like beans.  Amazon shipped freshly manufactured T-Discs so all is good.

review/summary: A little bit of stale bitterness detected
review/text: Starbucks Caffe Verona $10.99 for 12 (91 cents per drink)<br /><br />Individual tastes vary of course, but for me, these T-discs, higher in price than others, leave a bitter acidic aftertaste that I do not get from the Gavalia T-discs. Not bad when the drink is very hot, but halfway through, it's not so delicious. Having said that, the brewed coffee sold inside an actual Starbucks is often about the same as these, so if you can enjoy that, you may like these, and enjoy the convenience and savings.<br /><br />As with all the T-discs, you can improve your experience by starting with a warm cup/mug/glass and by never using the add more-water-to-overextract-the-grounds feature. If you feel you must add extra water to your cleverly designed coffee drink, do it with plain water through the yellow cleaner disc, not through the spent coffee disc.

review/text: I used to buy Caffe Verona for my regular coffeepot and decided to try this for my Tassimo when it came out.  I was disappointed in the flavor.  When I would drink from the coffeepot, it was sooooo good.  It didn't seem to have the same flavor from the t-discs.  I wouldn't buy it again.  Maybe it is the strength of the t-disc?  I prefer it kind of strong.

review/summary: Very Good Coffee
review/text: This coffee is really good! It has a good flavor and is strong.  One T-disc just about fills up a coffee mug to the top.  You get a good size, good tasting cup of coffee.<br /><br />At first I assumed there were fewer T-discs in the Starbuck packages (12 T-discs per pack) than the Gevalia (16 T-discs per pack) because Starbucks was just more expensive, but not so. The Starbuck T-discs are larger and hold more coffee so you get a much better cup of coffee, in my opinion.  It really is as tasty as getting the coffee from a Starbucks cafe.<br /><br />This website is not selling T-discs at double the price of the Tassimo website, as one reviewer mistakenly said.  Here you get 2 packages, on the Tassimo site , you get one package.<br /><br />I've had a Keurig (K-cups) for several years and Tassimo is much better. The coffee is a lot stronger, it tastes like REAL coffee, and there is a lot of variety as far as what you can make (coffee, cappuccino, espresso, latte).  K-cups only makes regular coffee and teas.  But Tassimo does not have the variety of brands nor the number of choices of different flavors of coffee and tea products as K-cups.  I think this will improve; Tassimo is a newer product than Keurig.  I am very pleased with the Tassimo.

He says the Starbucks Verona blend "is good coffee".<br />I'll be buying more of this product for sure.

review/summary: A bit disappointing
review/text: I ordered this for my Tassimo because I was looking for a cartridge that would make a full size cup of coffee for me in the morning.  I had been quite happy with Gevalia's Morning Blend -- it makes a large mug and is very tasty in the AM.  I think Verona is the best Starbucks blend, so I chose it when I was unable to reorder the Gevalia -- Amazon was out of stock!<br /><br />The Verona coffee is OK, but not as smooth tasting to me as when brewed in a regular drip coffee maker.  And I have problems with the oversized cartride -- which tends to stick up in the lid of the brewer after finishing.  It makes about an 8 oz. cup, not 12 oz. like the Gevalia brand.  It didn't seem worth the money to me and I won't be reordering.

review/summary: Perhaps a bit bitter in flavor
review/text: Taste is ultimately, of course, subjective. Nonetheless, I find this brew to be bitter in its initial tasting. It hits the front of the mouth with an initial bitterness, and the other flavors do not present themselves strongly enough to overcome that first impression. I should note that I have made five cups on consecutive mornings, so it is something endemic to the brew.<br /><br /> I do not use cream/sugar, and those who do may find the bitterness ameliorated, and the underlying boldness of this selection should carry through such additions.
