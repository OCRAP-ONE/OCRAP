review/summary: Neat, but not "wowwie!"
review/text: After reading reviews and testing these out with friends, I can say this: Everyone's tastes (and tastebuds) are different. What is not sweet to one person is super sweet to another. So be ye warned, results for these may vary.<br /><br />I found that the tablets didn't make things "sweet" as much it cut down on the sourness, almost like a numbing effect.  Ever put sugar on a lemon slice and bit into it? The sour kick is still there, just canceled out. I'm certainly not going to be eating them like candy as some reviews suggest.<br /><br />Tried out a few beer types, with mixed results: Beers that are fruity/citrus ended up gross, as it would taste like I mixed in a mouthful of juice with the beer. Dark beers like an Irish Red were my favorite.<br /><br />I really recommend going out to eat so you can try a variety of things. Certain foods will take you for surprise (ranch dressing, for example, was notably different and very good).

review/summary: MAMMA MIA!!!!
review/text: Wow, I DID NOT EXPECT such a quick, shocking result from this product, but it definitely delivers!!! My brother told me about these tablets and the "flavor tripping" parties. I had never heard of them before, but decided to give it a try just because the claim sounded so wildly strange, a sort of "Ripley's Believe it or not" kind of novelty.<br />Anyway, the tablets WORK immediately. I just took one, had a lemon, and voila': it's SWEET! I also tried a sip of Chianti wine.. SWEET.... I poured a spoonful of white vinegar in a small glass of water... SWEET... I haven't tried beer or other things, but sooner or later I will!<br />The best thing I see coming out of this is that I FINALLY don't need to sweeten my tea! I'll just squeeze a lemon in and that will be that.<br />Hmmm... perhaps I can add lemon juice to soda water and it can turn into a new diet soft-drink!! The possibilities are endless!

review/summary: it works... sorta
review/text: I do reccomend this product, as it is effective and very fun to try. Here are the setbacks: It only lasts around 30 minutes, not 2 hours. I bought these in lieu of the actual berries ($90 vs. $10) so they weren't as potent as I had read about/expected. Nonetheless, they do work! Lemons and limes were delicious!<br />Oh, be sure to move the tablet over the ENTIRE surface of your tounge in order to cover ALL of your taste buds.

review/text: Basically these tables change the way you taste acidic things, they will instead taste sweet. Lemons taste like a strong lemonade. Some of you might be thinking, well that's fun and all but how would my lover taste? well, kind of sweet(men and women). Give it a try you'll see. My only complaint is that they made them look so much like a drug that I had to convince some of my more prudish friends that it was just ground fruit.

review/summary: It works and was fun.
review/text: I got these for me and my boyfriend to try but he refused to try it with me... at first. I tried to explain to him that it's just fruit put in a pill form but he was convinced it was some type of trick I was trying to pull on him. Anyways so I went to the store and picked up some lemons, limes, tomatoes, kiwi, oatmeal stout beer (which I absolutely hate stout beer), sour candy and some red hots. I let the pill dissolve on my tongue and started out trying a lemon. One thing I recommend which I didn't do was to try out all the food first to get something to compare it to. I sat in front of my boyfriend and ate a whole lemon without even flinching. Then I told him to try it and he could barely lick it without making a face. Then I tried some stout beer... it tasted like cold coffee with a hint of kahluah. I eventually got him to take one of the pills. We had sooo much fun tasting foods!! it was amazing how much it worked!!!! I already recommended it to all my friends and now I recommend it to you. It can be a really cool party trick by betting someone you can eat a whole lemon without making a face.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: After dissolving one tab on my tongue, I ate 1/4 of a large lime, and it tasted mostly sweet with just a hint of tartness!  I would have eaten the whole lime but was worried all that acid might upset my stomach.  I didn't notice any difference when I ate parsley, though--the parsley still tasted somewhat bitter to me.  Miracle Berry worked extremely well for me with sour stuff, but not at all as far as I could tell with bitter stuff.<br /><br />Still, well worth the price to experience this amazing transformation in taste.<br /><br />Edit:  I had a craving for blackberries and bought a large container of them from a warehouse-type store.  I planned on eating them all at one sitting, but after one or two I couldn't eat them--they were mostly sour and hardly any sweet.  I remembered that I had some of these tablets left, so I rolled one around on my tongue until it dissolved, and thereafter the blackberries tasted pleasantly sweet, so I was able to finish them all.

review/summary: M-azing!
review/text: The mberry tabs work by altering your taste receptors and make sour tasting foods more sweet. I'm a high school science teacher, and I used these both in my classes and for my science club. The students love trying out different sour food items to taste the results. I've used this brand several times, and it seems to be pretty consistent in it's effectiveness and quality. The best way I can describe the effect of these tabs is it makes a lemon taste like a lemon "shake-up" from a fair/carnival. It does not create a super "candy-like" sweetness (which I think would be really weird anyway), there is still a hint of sour behind the sweet taste. Also, they do not last anywhere near an hour, more like 15-20 min., so just be warned, and be ready to taste things immediately after dissolving the pill in your mouth. In my experience, there have been a percentage of people for whom the tabs are not effective, maybe between 5-15% in a group (1-3 people per 20). The tabs are somewhat expensive, but as a pretty unique experience, I definitely recommend trying it at least once!

review/text: I just did a test run for a work party and I sampled raspberries, strawberries, lemons, limes, Tabasco sauce, goats cheese, beer, orange juice, and yogurt. First off, the lemon was the best tasting example of fruit I have ever had in my life. I wanted to eat the whole thing. The rest of the fruits tasted delicious. The unsweetened yogurt was good, the orange juice amazing, and the beer much sweeter. The goats cheese didnt taste that yummy to me and the tabasco sauce didnt have a noticeable change in flavor. Over all, a very fun and effective flavor changing experience!

review/summary: It does change the way you taste...
review/text: It does change the way you taste but not to such a great effect that you are expecting. It's more of a pleasant surprise and not a OMG! surprise. It makes sour and most fruits sweeter. It makes beer taste like some sort of sugary juice (and I don't like beer). I would like to try cream cheese and wine which are supposed to be yummy. I recommend this product and I only need a half a tablet to last about 45 min to an hour. I wouldn't dare try spicy foods as they suggest on the package but they suggest pineapple, cheese, peppers, and limes. Lemon in water tasted like lemonade with tons of sugar. I would experiement and see how it works out for you. It doesn't work on all foods though like potatoes or meats, as it mostly alters your sour or tart taste buds.

review/text: I purchased these tabs for my daughters "flavor tripping" party. I have never tried them out before so I invited a couple of friends over to experience this with me. I set up a spread our items, gave everyone a mberry, and got to tasting. The first item that we tried was a lemon and we were literally blown away because they were so sweet and tasty. Next came the dill pickle and it tasted like a sweet pickle. We even tried ketchup and mustard and couldn't stop dipping out fingers in it because the flavors were unbelievable. We also had a bottle of cheap dry wine and it was delicious. The strawberries were so delicious that we ate the entire bowl. Fruit rollups were great too. This is something that I know my daughter will enjoy at her party and I will be trying these time and time again.

review/summary: Flavor tripping is fun!
review/text: After reading an article online a while back about flavor tripping, I went looking for miracle berries and was surprised to find these handy tablets on Amazon. I was worried they wouldn't pack the punch the actual berries were reputed to, but they turned out to be a great purchase.<br /><br />It's true that how effective they are varies by person, and by the foods you try them with, but overall these were a big hit at numerous gatherings of friends and family. I've found that the biggest hits tend to be vinegar, and tart citrus like lemons, limes, or grapefruit juice. For me all go from being sour to very sweet (yes, to the point where if I didn't know better I'd be gulping the vinegar down). Dark beers are interesting, with the changed flavor still usually somewhat enjoyable. Foods or drinks that are already very sweet become cloying and unpleasant. It's still worth trying just to see the effect, but keep that in mind when choosing things to try with the tablets in advance.<br /><br />I've ordered these 4 times, and hope to do so again (at the time of this writing, they are not available). If they remain out of stock for too long, I'll have to try some of the alternatives. I'm reluctant to do so though, knowing how effective these are.

review/summary: So much fun - but don't forget the Tums!
review/text: My friend and I had a flavor tripping party for two.  We each dissolved one tablet on our tongues and then dug in to a plate full of lemons, limes and other sour items.  The effect was immediate and amazing.  We were laughing hysterically throughout the whole ordeal.  We also tried shots of vinegar, mustard by the spoonful (really yummy) and several other types of fruit.  We had a blast finding new things to try.  I think next we're going to have a big group over to play around.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you can split the tablets in half to lessen the effect.  Remember - if you're going to have a flavor tripping party of your own, pack some antacid.  After all we ate, we really needed it.<br /><br />Updates 12/20 - I gave mberry pills to friends for the holidays.  The pills didn't work for all of them.  Judging by some of the reviews the pills either don't work for everyone or not every pill is the same potency.  I contacted the seller who put me in touch with the manufacturer and they are sending me out a replacement batch to give the people who had a bad experience.  Excellent customer service all around.  I still wholeheartedly recommend giving the tablets a try.  If it works for you, it is really amazing.

review/summary: Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets
review/text: A friend referred me to these and told me that they were "freaking awesome." I decided to give them ago and surprisingly they work extremely well.  I found that the taste of them, while they are dissolving on your tongue is a bit horrid, but nothing I couldn't tolerate.<br /><br />After it dissolved me and some friends decided to test it.  We cut up some lemons and limes and decided to see if these really worked and to our amazement they really did.  The lemons tasted like a 'lemon drop' candy, and the limes were very refreshing.  We then expanded our horizons and started trying other things to see what it was like. We found some other foods to be excellent, and others not so much.  All in all it's very fun.<br /><br />They are, however, quite expensive. The effects on me lasted roughly 1-1.5 hours.  So as a novelty, hurray for these.

I really didn't even want to try it at first but i was told i had to. It tasted like the sweetest and most flavorful lemonade ever. Seriously, it was like candy all of the sudden. I almost couldn't believe it. When a few friends were over i gave them a pill each and we all of the sudden lemons were the best thing ever lol!

During her first chemo, she hated everything because everything tasted like metal and it was short of pulling teeth to get her to eat something.

During her second chemo she ate all her normal foods and actually enjoyed it making the entire process of eating during chemo a small miracle. We were so happy that she was eating because of this that we ordered more immediately!

review/summary: Too sweet for my tastes...
review/text: After reading most of the reviews, I was expecting the tablet to taste gross.  It does not.  It's not yummy, but it does have a slight (tart?) flavor to it.<br /><br />My first taste was of a strawberry.  It was way too sweet for me.  Almost tasted like I had put tons of sugar on the strawberry, or even sugar substitute.  Next I tried a blackberry, blueberry, pomegranate seed....they were sweeter, but I wasn't blown away by how "good" they tasted, just surprised at how my taste buds have changed.  Next up, a lemon!  Everyone has been right about the lemon, it tastes like lemonade!  I ate half of a lemon before I decided it was too sweet for me.  I put pomegranate flavored Greek yogurt over the fruit I just mentioned, and had a bite.  TOO SWEET for me!  Next up, some fermented spicy daikon (ever hear of "Dave's Gourmet Korean food"?  Everything is fermented in vinegar and it is DELICIOUS!).  The vinegar taste was gone, but the spiciness remained.  Interesting.  I actually like the regular flavor, unaltered, so I won't be having that again.  Oh, I also tried chocolate flavored coconut water--yuck!  There was a chocolate CHALKY taste to it.  It has now been 30 minutes and I just tried the other half of the lemon.  It still tastes sweet to me.  And then I had a sip of veggie broth (from "Dave's Korean") which is the only thing that has changed in a way that was pleasing to my taste buds.<br /><br />I'm giving the mberry four stars because it DOES do what it claims, it's just not my preferred way of tasting things.

So I thought I would try it out, and it is pretty cool, but not worth the outrageous price. About one minute after I sucked the tab I tried eating numerous things like limes, lemons, and oranges, just to name a few. It did make everything that's sour sweet. Not to the point of "oh my god, it's amazing" but it did work. So to sum this up, this stuff was good for a one time deal, but after doing it a few times it lost it's appeal.

review/text: The tablets do work but from I read in the description that half a tablet would work- it does, but you have to make sure your whole tongue and mouth had decent contact with the tablet piece.  The tablet dissolves quite fast in your mouth so 1/2 tablet may be too little.<br /><br />I tried again using 1 tablet and had good results- then tried with 2 and had slightly better results.  The effect was pretty good.  Lemons are still a bit sour to eat raw but its not that bad.  Grapefruit is particularly awesome with this tablet.  Limes were in between- still a little sour but tasted quite nice.  Overall I could still not eat too much lemon or lime and the acid content of both got me worried about stomaching too much.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: This product makes me want to buy a Miracle Fruit tree so I can have these awesome berries all the time.<br /><br />The biggest changes my husband and I noticed were in eating fruits & other berries. Store-bought strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, oranges, and green apples tasted like they were just picked off the plant/bush/tree at the height of ripeness. It was like being a kid again and biting into my first :)<br /><br />I didn't notice any change at all with anything bitter. Beers and coffees and teas tasted about the same. Spicy things like hot sauce tasted kind of gross. Savory things like noodles and meat got a slight hint of sweetness, but nothing THAT noticeable. Sweet things like candy and cake were made to be way too sweet to be palatable.<br /><br />Definitely make sure you get the tablet to slide all over your tongue, and don't chew -- leave it on your tongue until it dissolves.<br /><br />If you're a fan of sweet, succulent fruit, but can't get fresh produce from farmer's markets, do yourself a favor and try these. It's worth the price for the fun, at the very least :)

That is exactly what it was, the tablets themself have an odd taste (not the best) but for two hours afterward everything we ate was completely different from anything I've had before. Lemons, kiwi, strawberries, cheese, mustard, cranberry juice, OJ, and a lot more. IT all was completely different and was like experiencing these foods for the first time. Everything was sweet and tasted (with few exclusions) much better. I ended up eating whole lemons by the end because they were my favorite.<br /><br />These really are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone who likes food.

review/summary: Amazing.
review/text: I just bought the mberry with slight concerns that it will not work. All those concerns went away when I tried it. It was a tingly feeling at first where ever it was on the tongue. I didn't notice anything. First thing i tried was a grape. I mean this was the most delicious grape I had ever tasted. I started try all the fruits and sodas i could. Amazing. People don't realize that you should use it on fruits and things with acidity. It is supposed to make them sweeter. Although it did make one of my cookies sweeter it wasn't nearly as dramatic as when I ate a lime. It tasted like lime-ade. I wouldn't suggest eating a bunch of lemons because this only affects your tongue. Not your stomach. When you buy these you run the risk that it won't work, but it probably will. Very pleased.

review/text: I really enjoyed this, tried it with my family and my dad was so skeptical at first but when he took a bit into the lemon he was flabbergasted! The look on his face was priceless. Best for groups of friends unless you experiment alone but the more the merrier! Wish it came with more berries per the price which is a bit steep for tablets and not the real berries which are hard to come by. People said it lasts only a couple minutes but for me it was a decent 15 minutes or more. Obviously the lemons with juice and other fruits will make it end quicker since there are liquids washing it out. Just have everything prepared and on the table before you take it!

review/summary: Miracle berry + lemons = AWESOMENESS
review/text: I was researching the miracle berry protein miraculin for a research proposal, so I decided to give these tablets a try. The effect was immediate, and lasted approximately 20 min for me and my coworkers. Everyone was completely in love with the lemons, and those who normally enjoy the flavor of lime went nuts over them as well. For some the effect was actually too sweet, and they gave up after a few foods. Other foods/beverages tested were blackberries and raspberries (lost their tartness), red wine vinegar (sweet on the tongue, but not so great in the throat) and Corona (loses bitterness and is sweet if you squeeze some lime into it). It certainly is not cost effective as a diet aid, but it's a great parlor trick to share when you are entertaining.

review/summary: Very slight effect....
review/text: Maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone. It had very little effect when I used it. I started with a clear pallet, let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc. Then I tried the classic first, a lime. I noticed, barely, that it was not quite as pucker inducing as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly. And it did not add any "sweet". It just inhibited a hint of sour. Other foods like vinegar, vinegar chips, Guinness, strawberries, cheese, etc. Many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact. And after just a few minutes, I could notice any change.<br /><br />So, either, some people just don't have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and heightened suggestibility. Either way, they were a let down.

review/summary: Pretty Fun!!
review/text: We found these tablets to be pretty fun! I suggest dissolving a full tablet in your mouth, not cutting it in half as others suggested. And definitely be sure to move the tablet around your ENTIRE tongue...I missed the back of my tongue when dissolving the tablet so whenever I'd swallow I'd get a hint of the real flavor.<br /><br />However, it was definitely neat to see how the tablet changes your taste!! We tried lemons, limes, grapefruit, buffalo wing flavored potato chips, sour patch kids, warhead sour spray, dill pickles, oranges, whiskey, and wine. I found the ruby red grapefruit to be absolutely AMAZING. The dill pickles tasted so much like sweet pickles, I had to double check the jar to make sure they weren't! Pinot grigio was particularly delicious, as the tablet cut through the sour-ness turning it super sweet!!<br /><br />Oranges were okay, just tasted a little sweeter than normal. The lemons were still a bit sour but I found myself eating 4 slices of them, which I don't think I could have done without the tablets! I swear, the ruby red grapefruit was by far the best, in my opinion.<br /><br />We found that the more sour a food, the more drastic an effect. I definitely recommend trying these tablets with a full fridge so you can experience all types of foods! I'd say some grapefruit, lemons, and dill pickles are a must to try with these.<br /><br />They're great to try with friends, as the novelty wears off after one or two tries. As long as there are new people around though, it's fun to see other reactions to the tablets. Definitely recommend!!

review/text: As other reviewers have pointed out, the effects vary from person to person. Each tablet seemed to last up to a half hour (longer for my sister)and while it did make things noticeably sweeter, the initial taste of something was identical, and it slowly got sweeter after the first half a second. Oh, and sour/bitter drinks like Monster took on a sickly sweet syrupy flavor that may leave you feeling a bit ill after. Don't try Apple cider vinegar, it tastes fine if a bit odd on your tongue, but as soon as it hits your throat the flavor and fumes were overpoweringly awful.

review/text: I was curious and decided to buy this product because of it (and despite the price).  It worked and is SERIOUSLY cool.  I followed the directions by putting a whole tablet on my tongue and letting it completely dissolved.  Sliced up a lemon and very warily put it in my mouth just to find that it tasted like a sweet lemonade.  There was only a slight tinge of sour.  I would have happily KEPT eating lemons, as they were delicious, the the acid on my lips told me to stop.  I plan on buying MUCH more of this product in the future.  It works and is fantastic!

review/summary: Miracle? No. Fun? Absolutely!
review/text: Bought some of these after getting frustrated about not being able to grow the plant at my house (for those curious, I live in Northern California).  I've always been intrigued after seeing numerous videos on the internet.  I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical.<br /><br />When I got the package, I popped a whole tablet in my mouth and let is swish around my entire tongue until it dissolved.  As for the flavor, if any of you have had Haw Flakes from any Asian market, that's what it tastes like.  For those who don't know, don't worry, it's nothing disgusting.  Kinda bland, to be honest.  After is dissolved, the first thing I tried was a lime.  Verdict: Sweet.  Not overly sweet, but still sweet.  Kind of like a lemonade just a tad of sugar missing.  Next up, apple cider vinegar.  Verict: Sweet.  Doesn't taste exactly like apple cider like some people say, but I see what they're saying.  Last test is cheese.  It tasted different, but not exactly a big change.<br /><br />As for how long it lasted, I would say after 30-45 minutes, it started to fade.  After an hour, it was gone.<br /><br />Bottom line, it was fun to try it out and I will definitely be trying out more things in the future.  As for hosting a flavor-tripping party?  Maybe a good business venture.

It comes with a list of items you can use it with, lemons,strawberries,cheese. I was using it to try and mask the taste of the salt water flush while doing the master cleanse. It DOES NOT mask salt water. Not sure of a use I'd have for it. It does what it claims, just not needed for me.

Bitter foods and drinks still tasted bitter to me.  Sweet foods and drinks didn't taste any sweeter.  I was prepared to write the whole thing off as placebo effect on the part of some people but the positive reviews made me try again.  It was when I drank pure lemon juice that I noticed a difference.  Pure lemon tasted like lemonade.  So the product does work, it just may not work exactly as advertised for you.

I got the strongest effects from vinegar, ketchup/mustard and Salt-vinegar chips. But nothing tasted miraculously better as I had expected. As others have pointed out, everyone reacts differently. The two other people I did it with seemed to have about my reaction as well. One experienced a bit stronger and the other one a bit weaker than me. You could try this if you are interested but I wouldn't buy it again.

review/text: First of all, these things taste pretty bad. If you can handle the taste while they melt on your tongue, maybe it wouldn't be AS bad. But I really didn't notice much change in the taste of foods. Lemons tasted sweet, but that's all I noticed. I considered trying two at a time, but they just tasted so bad to me that I have never used them again.

review/summary: Not quite the miracle we were expecting...
review/text: After reading the reviews on Amazon and researching food ideas online I got some friends together and we all divulged.  Out of the seven of us who took it, three of us just felt sick after the process.  All of us concluded that while our taste buds were playing tricks on us, they were not necessarily good tricks.  I wouldn't say sour things tasted sweet for instance, I would say they tasted weird kind of like lychees but not very good ones.  The only thing I tried that really improved after dissolving the pill on my tongue was a Coors light.  It tasted like a pretty good Pilsner after the pill, and everyone seemed to like this, but sometimes a nice cold Coors light is just what you need, so...  If you have nothing left to spend your money on, this isn't the worst choice in the world, but don't expect a miracle, because that is not going to happen.  Expect a stomach ache, a loss of appetite, and then you won't find disappointment.

review/text: My husband and I were excited to try them. We bought pineapple, beer, lemon, lime, hot peppers, cheese and wine. The only thing we noticed any difference in was the lemon and lime. The lemon was pretty easy to eat because it added some sweetness - it remained quite sour though. We each let one tablet dissolve on our tongue as directed so not sure what the problem was.

review/summary: Placebo tablets, I think
review/text: I and a friend tried these tablets before sampling various kinds of foods we'd seen suggested online, but noticed no effects whatever. We used them as suggested, then even tried multiple tablets at once. Maybe I got a bad batch or maybe we have unusual taste buds, but in any case it was very disappointing. Makes me think I should have tried the berries themselves instead.

review/text: After reading several glowing reviews about this product, I decided to buy it and see for myself how great it is.<br /><br />After following the instructions, I taste tested a variety of items, that were suggested on the packaging. None of which seemed to have any affect. On lemons, I noticed a slight taste change, however the lemon was no sweeter.<br /><br />Bottom line; the product is over-hyped, and in my opinion, is not worth the buying. I know it's definitely not something I will ever purchase again.

review/summary: Nothing Miraculous Here
review/text: StumbleUpon users, be wary. I was browsing when I stumbled upon an article about miracle berries- a cool new fad that apparently causes things to taste different than they normally would. Naturally, I tried to see where I could get my hands on some.<br /><br />Once I found the mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets, I did some research. I always look at a lot of reviews and alternatives before buying anything on Amazon. The price was relatively cheap, I figured, if it worked as advertised. The aggressive claims on the product's page and the Amazon user reviews also furthered my need to investigate this mystery product, so I bought two packs- one for me and one for my friend.<br /><br />After both of us trying the Miracle Berry tablets, I'd have to say that the product is extremely overhyped, and the experience was, unfortunately, lacking.<br /><br />The way mberry talks about their tablets, you'd expect to have a Willy Wonka-esque food tasting bonanza. Sadly, this isn't the case, and though the tablets do change the flavors of many foods to a degree, it's much more subtle than you'd probably like- no Snozzberries here. I found this to be the case for me, and I was hoping maybe my taste buds were maybe just a bit more dull, but my friend reported the same experience.<br /><br />I'm giving the product 2 stars, not because I hated the product, but because I was very let down with the experience and taking that fact into consideration, I don't think it's worth the money.

I may even be willing to pay $10.00 for a pack of 10.<br />Anything more than $10 is total robbery.<br /><br />So, obviously, $17.99 is WAY too much.<br /><br />This product is SUPER cool, and I LOVED how it worked.<br /><br />But, really? $18.00?<br /><br />Mberry should Market their product as a food enhancer, not as a "Flavor tripping experience".<br /><br />If Mberry does that, and prices their products reasonably, it WILL gain customers.<br /><br />Keeping there product around as a "Flavor tripping experience" will surely make it a passing fad.

review/summary: Works - Sort of
review/text: I bought these tablets to try during lunch at work. Four of us each tried one tablet, tasted various foods, and noticed no difference. At that point, I gave up, but two intrepid friends went on to try four tablets each. They reported strange flavors in some of the foods they tried, but many items remained unaffected. Among those that were was a fruit punch Powerade reported to taste so sweet as to be very repulsive (like drinking pure sugar), and a cashew which apparently tasted like heaven. Most other affected foods were impacted negatively.<br /><br />In all, we were unimpressed with these tablets. While they did accomplish their flavor-changing purpose, it took a lot of tablets before any change was noticeable. And the experience, though fun, was rather pricey considering how many tablets were required. I was really hoping for a bigger impact.

review/summary: The effect is barely perceptible and definitely not worth trying more than once
review/text: My girlfriend loves grapefruit, but I absolutely hate the stuff.  For her, it starts and ends very sweet, for me (and most people in the world) it starts sweet and ends bitter.  After we tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LXYA5Q">Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets</a>tablet, there was a small difference for both of us.  For me, the bitterness subsided a small amount-- not even enough to worth mentioning.  For her, the grapefruit tasted like one of the "sweetest" ones she'd ever had.<br /><br />However, the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes.  Both of which tasted noticeably better.  However, the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes.  To be honest, I hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour, but as is, you're paying quite a bit per minute for these things (we paid ~$20 for ten tablets w/ shipping).<br /><br />Would I try it again?  After the tablets we have left are finished, I think not.  I already enjoy gala apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries without this tablet-- I can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit, lemons or limes DIRECTLY (lemon and lime are fine in foods).<br /><br />If you're dead-set on trying these tablets, try it with some of your friends, but don't expect too much.

review/text: I read all the positive reviews and thought I'd give it try. First of all it tasted stale.  Secondly I had to use 5 spoonfuls just to get any taste and then it didn't taste like the chocolate. It tasted more like Olvatine.  For the young people out there, Ovaltine was drink in the 50's, Which I didn't like any better. We all have different tastes.  For my part I won't be ordering this again.  UPDATE: I bought the Milk chocolate at the same time and decided to try that.  It was delicious.  I can't explain the difference but I'd recommend the Milk Chocolate just stay away from the one with the marshmallows.

It's much better than other fat-free hot cocoa varieties but doesn't do justice to regular Stephen's Hot Cocoa.  I'm going back to the good stuff.

review/text: I ordered this as the price was certainly right (6 1lb cans for less than $30) and the reviews were good.<br /><br />This is certainly a step up in the hot cocoa market. Better than just about anything you can find in the supermarket. I certainly prefer hot chocolate - but it can be time-consuming to make and it's tough to heat milk and melt chocolate at work or in class.<br /><br />This is the perfect compromise for when you want that chocolate drink and aren't in a position to 'do it right'.<br /><br />Very good taste and dissolves well. I always use a little more than it says on the can - with some cocoa that means it won't all dissolve - this is not a problem here.<br /><br />Certainly recommended.

review/summary: Stephen's Hot Candycane Cocoa is the best!
review/text: We have been drinking Stephen's Candycane Cocoa for several years.  Our Walmart carries it at Christmas time, but they run out fast.  It's the candycane pieces in the cocoa that make it soo good!  You can make it as strong or weak as you like it, by adding more cocoa or more water than the directions say.  I like it a little stronger - it gives it a bold chocolate taste with a strong candycane kick!  I don't know what else to tell you except it is absolutely out of this world!  All you need is a cup, a spoon, hot water, and Stephen's Candycane Cocoa.  You're set, drink up!  Just remember not to use it all up in one setting!<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing I would change about this product is the number of cups of cocoa per can.  It calls for 3 1/2 rounded tablespoons of cocoa mix per 6 ounces of hot water.  When Sara and I make a 12 oz cup each and each have a refill, we can almost kill off one can in a sitting.  (Yes, it IS that good!)  I wish Stephen's could concentrate this or put it up in larger cans.<br /><br />I hope I have helped in your purchasing decision.

Amazingly, that is not the case with this mix, even with no milk added this has a great rich, chocolate-mint taste.<br /><br />Because it doesn't require milk, I can keep it at work for a warm-up drink on cold office days. I usually put 4 teaspoons of mix in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P6855Y">Aladdin 16-Ounce Recycled and Recyclable Tumbler, Lily</a> then add hot water from the dispenser at work for a perfect mug of hot chocolate.

review/summary: Absolutely the BEST!!!
review/text: I bought this hot chocolate at a grocery store because it looked interesting.  We like to drive around our neighborhood and look at the Christmas lights.  I always like to drink hot chocolate while enjoying this outing.  Oh My Gosh!  This hot chocolate was incredible. When I opened the can to make it, I saw pieces of Candycane candy in the chocolate powder. I made it the way that they suggested, with hot water, not milk.  It was so creamy with just the right amount of peppermint flavor.  There were no lumps and it was excellent to the last drop.  I am thrilled to see that they carry this on Amazon because I know that the grocery store only carried it for the holidays and the price on Amazon is much less than I paid.

review/summary: I agree!!
review/text: These folks are right.  This stuff is very rich and we just use skim milk.  Richer than the expensive chocolate shavings we have splurged on in the past.  The tins go along ways too.  The per serving cost is a fraction of buying the individual packets at the grocery store of other brands, but I would pay more anyway because this stuff is so good.  We just had to order another case.  Try it with some coffee.  Mash it up in some vanilla ice cream. Seems like they could sell it for much more if they got rid of the dude's first name.  First name only brands really cheese up the product.  How about "Cocoa Passions" or "Divine Cocoa" or even, "Serenity Now Cocoa".  Anything would Glam up the product name a little. I am a builder, would you buy an expensive house from "Kreg's Stately Mansions"? Nope.  Doesn't matter how choice the work is. I am sorry, Stephen, you do have a great product, I'll stop. Oh well, keep the prices low...Five stars, brother.

review/summary: Not Ghirardelli, but not bad.
review/text: I just bought a six-pack of Stephen's Gourmet Hot Cocoa mix.  It's pretty good for the price.  My favorite will always be Ghirardelli -- but this does the trick in a pinch.

review/summary: Great Cocoa
review/text: This is the perfect cocoa to sit by a fire/listen ot the rain/cuddle next to your loved ones. I had to order it on amazon, since it was only available in UT where I used to live. I'm so glad I ordered it!  Choc  Rasp is the best flavor but Chocolate Hazelnut, Chocolate Mint, and Milk Chocolate are also excellent.

review/summary: Very tasty - maybe a little too rich if making with milk
review/text: I really enjoyed this, and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well (if they are re-stocked - it seems that most of them are sold out).  I wanted something a little better than what I find in my area grocery stores, and this was really good.  The first time we made it, it was with milk, and it was a little too rich for me (which I thought was impressive, especially as I was only using skim milk), so I've since moved to a combination of milk and water, and it tastes GREAT (and I'll probably still make it with just milk, after adjusting more towards that over time).  My house is known for hot cocoa (we have at least 7 options right now), but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it.

review/text: Has just enough of the raspberry taste without being over bearing. Will purchase more in the future when my supple depletes.  I had trouble finding a good raspberry hot cocoa but now I know where to get it.  This site will be one of my favorites.

review/text: do you like dark chocolate?  wish you could find quality dark chocolate cocoa mix?  this is the real deal!  i have tried a few different "dark" chocolate mixes.  this one stands above others in it's smooth'ness and creamy quality.  nice and dark, add some honey or cinnamon and you'll have a fantastic cuppa cocoa.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: I ordered the No Sugar Added version. I usually like no sugar added or low sugar products - ice cream, yogurt, hot chocolate etc. But this one was terrible. Like the other reviewer, this tasted like ovaltine. I had to use like 5 spoons of the powder to get the taste. I don't know what to do with 5 other cans.. I will probably donate..

review/summary: It's the Best
review/text: I have tasted several Stephen's Gourmet products, but the Chocolate Raspberry is my favorite. It's creamy, smoothe and delicious.  I consider it my one splurge for myself.  I have a cup every morning and have now shared my favorite beverage with my son, who just cannot get enough of it.  He has created different recipes with it, one using ice cream.  I will stick to the original method.  It's the best hot cocoa mix I have ever tasted.  The aroma alone will draw you in.  I am often asked what is that wonderful smelling beverage.  Occasionally I will share in hopes they will purchase their own.  Stephen's Gourmet makes the best cocoa ever.  I will drink it as long as they continue to make it.

review/text: I love this stuff!  This is my favorite of the flavors I have tried.  I do feel like I have to add quite a bit of chocolate powder to get it to the flavor that I like, but that is okay.  I'd take this over any of the other stuff any day.  Swiss Miss is for the kids and this stuff is for me.  My husband loved the milk chocolate...until he tried the amaretto.  I just stick with this because I haven't found that I like the others as much.  Even though I don't like the others as much, all of the Stephen's cocoa that I have tried is the richest out there.  It doesn't taste like I mixed it with water at all.
