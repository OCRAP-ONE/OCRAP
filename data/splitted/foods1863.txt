review/summary: Great for dips!
review/text: I mix this with 0% fat plain greek yogurt (I buy Fage) for a rich flavored no guilt dip! I sometimes add extra minced fresh onion, maybe  chopped fresh chives or parsley, too. You can add a little extra powdered garlic or onion powder if you want a stronger dip.  Depends what I'll be dipping.  Carrots sticks, broccoli, celery- it all goes well with this dip! Refridgerate overnight if you want the flavors to blend.  A very nice mix that doesn't have the fake additives, color, msg or msg-like ingredients.  If you like dip but don't like the guilt, mix this with 0% fat greek yogurt!!! I forgot- for extra kick, add a tiny bit of horseradish...good on top of a chopped up grilled steak sandwich!

review/summary: Better and cheaper than Starbucks VIA
review/text: I really enjoy Douwe Egberts coffee.  My girlfriend turned me on to it about a year ago.  She would drive out of her way to some restaurant just to get herself a cup.  We later found out that Burger King's BK JOE was actually Douwe Egberts so we could get it pretty much when ever we wanted.  Unfortunately BK switched to Seattle's Best earlier this year so we would have to again venture out to that tiny restaurant to enjoy a cup.  When I saw this product, I figured I'd have to give it a try since I've tried the VIA freeze dried coffee from Starbucks and enjoyed it.  I'm happy to report that this product is better than VIA and significantly more affordable.<br /><br />I purchased this on 7/30/2010 and it was at my door 2 days later.  The expiration date on the packages is 1/03/2012.  I'm probably going to stock up on a few cases of this since I have a terrible track record of finding something I like once then never being able to find it again.<br /><br />200 8oz servings ($.23 a cup)<br />I would describe this as a medium/light bodied roast with a very slight nutty flavor.<br /><br />Remember, taste is subjective and I don't claim to be an expert of any kind on coffee.

review/summary: Great Instant Coffee!
review/text: When I found these coffee sticks I was excited.  When I received them and tried them I was estatic!  It was the same wonderful flavor I remembered from the restaurant where I first encountered Douwe Egbert coffee. I moved to an area where I was unable to locate someone serving this coffee so I was happy to find a way to bring it to my home.  Even though the coffee is a little pricey, I am totally pleased with my purchase. The coffee sticks produce a perfect cup of coffee every time, in my opinion.

review/summary: Very weak coffee but pleasant flavor
review/text: My husband and I have been using Starbucks Via for quick fixes of coffee. I was attracted to this by both the price and reviews. I have to say that the price is not good when you have to use two packets to a cup. The coffee, while pleasantly flavored, is very weak when compared to a single packet of Via. If you like a weak diner coffee then you should be happy with this. If you prefer a richer flavor then you will have to double up or look elsewhere.

review/summary: Very Good - From a Coffee Snob
review/text: I purchased as a component of my food stuffs preparedness program.<br /><br />My morning coffee today was whole bean "small batch" Ethiopian.  Needed a boost between Divisional Play Off Games. I took a packet added hot water and some Splenda.  Surprisingly good.<br /><br />IMHO, all instant coffee has some aftertaste, though I found this to be very minimal and it didn't hit me until after I finished the entire cup.<br /><br />I am curious to see how this tastes iced during warm weather.<br /><br />Not a replacement for fresh ground or even DD.  However, as an alternative to a trip out or not wanting to deal with mess and effort of brewing 1-cup, not a bad alternative and as a component of a food preparedness program, an excellent option.

review/summary: Buy it packaged in canister instead...Delicious coffee!!!
review/text: For those of you that love the taste of this coffee as I do, here is my advice. Buy the one in the glass canister. It will cost about the same per cup and then you have a nice glass canister for other things. The coffee gets 5 stars, the packaging gets 2 stars...here is why: The packaging is misleading because when you cost it out , you think, 300 cups of coffee...that is about 17 cents a cup and the coffee is really some of the best, if not THE BEST tasting you will find...but it takes 3-4 packets per cup. That is still not that much for a great tasting cup of coffee, but you would do better to buy it packaged in a nice glass canister.

review/summary: How Delicious it is!
review/text: My girlfriend found Douwe Egberts in a Las Vegas restaurant a year ago and really liked it.  We went back to the same restaurant and it was just as good the second time as the first time.  Asked our waiter what brand it was and he came back with it on a piece of paper.  We thanked him a bunch and when we came home we found it at Amazon.  Decided to give the packets of instant a try and the girlfriend just smiled with the first sip.  Now when we go out she will carry a packet or two with her and at a restaurant she will ask for hot water.  We tell them what we are doing and to charge appropriately.  Not that cheap, we want to be fair.  Anyway she really likes it and now I purchase an extra box as a backup so she will never run out.

review/summary: The best instant coffee
review/text: I first had Douwe Egberts coffee at a restaurant and loved it.  I drink instant coffee on the mornings I don't have time to brew a pot of coffee before work. These packets make a delicious cup of coffee. They are the right size for a good cup but on the mornings when I need an extra 'kick' I add another one. This is really very, very good coffee, is a little more expensive than the grocery store instant but is worth the price. I even take a few packets with me to work when I need a pick-me-up in the afternoon and no coffee is brewed. Will definitely purchase again, and again, and again.

review/summary: Very surprising
review/text: I'm not much of a fan of instant coffee, but appreciate the convenience when I can't either brew my own or buy a cup. That being said, I went on the search for an instant coffee that actually tastes somewhat decent. Starbucks VIA is the obvious choice, but the price (and the frequency in which I intend to drink said instant coffee) was rather prohibitive, so I started with Maxwell house and Folgers, the ol' standby! They lacked taste and didn't quite agree with my stomach, so I finally decided to search Douwe Egberts on a whim, thinking they would be too cool for school to possibly make a lowly instant coffee. Well, they certainly do, and let me tell you it's pretty good. Instant coffee it is, but terrible it is not. Smooth enough with the right amount of water, and flavorful as well. It certainly surprised my palate, and helped me to change my preconceptions about instant coffee. Try it, I dare you.

We started with purchasing one box, but we are going to start the monthly order.

review/summary: Superb Tabouli ! (But, no recipe is included.) Highly Recommended!
review/text: I enjoy Tabouli, thus, I ordered a large amount. The other reviews indicate that this s a fine quality mix. Could someone please send me the correct recipe for the use of this mix? I can find no phone number for the company and Amazon was not very helpful with this issue (a big surprise, Amazon is usually great in dealing with problems and issues). Therefore, I mark this product down to 1 star. After I experiment with various combinations, I will add to this review. I hope that this product is as good as everyone has mentioned in their reviews. But, I do think that the company should include instructions.<br /><br />UPDATE: This is the best Tabouli mix that I have ever experienced. I can unreservedly recommend this mix to all. I am glad that I was able to acquire this mix in bulk, it is delicious and will disappear quickly. There is no recipe included,but,this is how I made mine:<br /><br />2 cups mix<br />2c. boiling water<br />7T Olive Oil<br />1/2 cup fresh lemon juice<br />1/4 t. cayenne pepper<br />5 green onions -thinly sliced<br />2 tomatoes- small bits<br />1/2 of a diced "European"" Cucumber<br />Salt and pepper to taste<br /><br />Pour boiling water over mix, let sit, covered with plastic wrap 'til the mix has cooled. Fluff with fork. Add olive oil and lemon juice, taste and adjust quantities as needed. Add remaining ingredients. Let sit for a few hours so that flavors meld. I have a cold kitchen and did not refrigerate the Tabouli. American refrigerators make the Tabouli too cold, which dulls the flavor. Ideally, this is best made on the day of consumption, if you keep it a few days, it becomes soggy and less tasty. If you have good Feta, the type in brine, add bits of that to the Tabouli or sprinkle it on the top of each serving.<br /><br />Note: For my taste, the mix has enough mint, others may prefer to add some chopped, fresh mint.

The steak sauce was reasonable at $6.99, but the shipping was $8.95 by UPS and it was late.  The US Post Office would have shipped it cheaper and delivered it faster.

They taste awful. I know that no matter what people say, diet food will never taste as good as regular food but at least it should be palatable. It doesn't taste anything like peanut butter or chocolate, it's more grainy than crunchy, and it leaves this weird after taste in my mouth. I think I will be switching back to Slim Fast, at least I actually enjoy their products.

review/summary: New taste is disappointing. So is the additional sugar
review/text: These became my favorite meal bars after I purchased a few at a gas station while evacuating during Hurricane Katrina. They were sugar free, and, to me at least, tasted a little like Snickers (or at least how I remembered Snickers tasting; I hadn't had one in a while).<br /><br />Somewhere in there, Kraft changed the formula, adding sugar while still retaining some of the artificial sweeteners. I found the taste to be similar, but not nearly as good. Worst part was a metallic aftertaste.<br /><br />Well, Kraft stopped producing these, and I didn't miss them too much, because they weren't the same. I still checked periodically to see if they would come out again, though. I saw recently that they'd been rereleased, but also that they'd been reformulated yet again. Now they're chewy (they had been crunchy) and are sweetened without artificial sweeteners (they use stevia, a natural sweetener, in addition to more sugar). It has a stronger peanut taste than before, very different from the Kraft bars. At least that metallic taste is gone.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend buying a single box (or single bar if possible) if you want to try these. I used to prefer this flavor to the chocolate South Beach meal bars, but now I prefer the chocolate. The taste of those actually improved with the reformulation. I'd rate the original chocolate peanut butter meal bars 5 stars, the new chocolate meal bars 4 stars, and these new chocolate peanut butter meal bars 3 stars.<br /><br />What I'd really like is for someone to produce 1% cheese slices like Kraft produced under the South Beach name a while back. I only found it at Sam's Club for a short time.

review/text: The previous version of these meal replacement bars were amazing ... better tasting, better texture (a bit crunchier, kind of like a rice crispy treat), and healthier, with less sugar.<br /><br />The new version is ok - I think it is better than most meal replacement bars from a taste-to-health ratio stand point.<br /><br />But they are definitely not as good as previous version.  New version has more sugar, a weird soft/chewy (but in a bad way) texture, and a bit of an after taste.  I don't know what was wrong with the last recipe.  Please bring it back!

review/summary: Doable Flavor & Ingredients for Low Carb
review/text: Having lost 15 lbs in the past 2 months on a low-carb diet, I have tried several brands of meal replacement bars. This South Beach Chocolate Peanut Butter bar is pretty good. I like it better than the Slim-Fast 3-2-1 Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavored meal replacement bars, anyway. And it is less gassy than some delicious Atkins bars...<br /><br />Fully vitamin fortified, these are just a tad lower in sugars and a bit higher in protein than the typical Slim-Fast bar, and about half the fat and 4x the sugar of the typical Atkins bar. As a pre-diabetic (or whatever they are calling the condition these days : ) this South Beach bar has enough protein and fat, and is just a bit higher in sugars than I would prefer. Anyone in the diabetic category should do some reading about carbs/protein/fat ratios in our food, as we need some fat and protein with our meals to slow down the absorption of carbs.<br /><br />I recommend trying any new bar in a small box to make sure you like it and are not sensitive to any of the ingredients before going hog-wild on a case...<br /><br />See my other reviews for my take on more low-carb, chocolate-based snacks and meal-replacement bars.

review/summary: Great Flavor Great Results
review/text: I love these  South Beach Diet Meal Bar, Chocolate Peanut Butter, 5-Count (Pack of 8) .  I just ordered another batch.  I find the flavor and texture to be very good.  I'm surprised with the negative reviews.<br /><br />Each bar is 180 calories contains just 6 grams of fat per serving and 0 trans fats, 12 grams of protein, 9 grams of fiber, and 23 essential vitamins and minerals. They are very convenient when you're on the run.<br /><br />I injured my knee 6 months ago.  I needed surgery and had that in April.  I wanted to lose weight prior to my surgery.  I knew my knee would do better without the extra weight.  I used the South Beach diet. Prior to the surgery I did not use the bars.  I managed to lose about 20 pounds.  After the surgery my husband had to prepare meals.  At breakfast I had the bar.  Lunch he would prepare a SB style meal.  I had South beach meals prepared in the freezer for dinners.  8 weeks later I had lost another 10 pounds.  All of my weight loss was without working out. I have to say I'm very pleased with the results.

review/summary: Great Bar but Price keeps going up
review/text: These bars are one of the best tasting bars that also contain loads of vitamins. I would recommend these for anyone looking for daily essential vitamins. 50% vitamin A, 100% of vitamin C and E. 20% or more of just about every other vitamin. But as I stated in the title of the review, the price has increased regularly over the past 6 months.  Great news to anyone who has not noticed that Walmart, everyones favorite competitor has once again started to supply the New South Beach diet Meal Bars at a fraction of the cost, only 5.98 a box! Compared to Amazons price of over 7.00 a box! I hope you have a Walmart in your area. I hope you find this helpful. I would hope that Amazon would also realize they are going to have to lower their price if they want to sell to more consumers who are looking for a good deal!

review/text: Do not buy these if you were hooked on these prior to the last 2 months or so (April '13) I did not have any issues with the artifical sweeteners, and the old bars tasted AMAZING - as we all agreed (and as I gave a 5 star review for several years ago). These taste only slightly better than a 30G protein bar (with only 12G of protein now). One of the more disappointing food changes in recent memory, I used to LIVE off these bars!

review/summary: Really different.
review/text: Stash teas, overall, are very good--they use generous amounts of essential oils or flavoring agents in their mixes--in this case lemongrass.  This tea is lemon and light mint with a grassy aftertaste.<br /><br />What's really interesting about this, is that it's a much lower caffeine tea even without the decaffeination process because it's white tea, or tea from the tips of the camellia sinensis (tea) plant. The lower down in the plant you go, the higher the amount of caffeine in tea made from the leaves.<br /><br />This is good for later in the day if you are one of those people who drinks tea all day long.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Edit:  This tea grows on you.  It's really good for drinking as iced tea if you're just thirsty.

There are few "flavored" teas I can drink (berry, for example, reminds me too much of the flavored lipgloss I wore in elementary school), but this white tea with lemon is very subtle in flavor.  It is delicious either hot or as iced tea.  I would highly recommend that you try this!

I love pretzels in general but these have just a hint of sweetness and 2 grams of fiber for a 120-calorie serving. The serving size is eight twists, which is a good amount. Overall, it's a low-calorie yet very satisfying snack. It's also not nearly as messy as crackers for my son.

They do seem to dry out if left out but if you put them in a ziplock bag with a few drops of water and put in microwave for about 10 seconds you can give them a second life.

review/summary: Excellent training guides for our food motivated hound!
review/text: I love the Zukes Mini Naturals and so does my 4.5 month old Alaskan Malamute!  He loves every flavor (except peanut butter for some reason) and will pretty much do whatever it takes to deserve a little treat.  They are small enough to put a handful in your pocket for walking around, prompting awesome behavior while you are out and about.<br /><br />He has learned "Touch", "High Five", "Sit", "Down", "Wait" (just try to teach that one to a food motivated Malamute!!), "Turn Around" and we are working on "Bang Bang".  He heels nicely and is a pleasure to take out wherever we are going because if I have a pocket full of Zukes he is on his best best behavior!<br /><br />One note of warning:  The treats dry out a bit if you leave them in your pockets (I seem to have a few in each of my jackets) and if you don't remove them then your workplace pooch might chew a hole in your jacket pocket while you are in a meeting (one of my workmates brings her English Bulldog into the office).<br /><br />3 calories each??  Heck yeah... reward that good behavior!  Makes you and your dog happy!

review/summary: Zuke's Minis are great for training
review/text: I've been using Zuke's Mini's for training since I first brought my girl home and she (surprisingly, for she's quite picky) still tolerates them and *sometimes* even seems to want to work for them. (Not having a food motivated dog SUCKS for training - I could literally be walking around with big macs in my pockets and it just wouldn't matter) They are low calorie and reasonably cheap (I can actually find them at some local stores cheaper than I can on Amazon, sometimes) as the bags tend to last a while. (I actually use kibble mixed with the treats when working with her, becuase I'm sneaky like that and she doesn't notice the difference once we get going)<br /><br />Of course not all dogs work with all treats - and it SHOULD be noted that although these treats do not have a lot of the "bad" ingredients in them they still do have grains. (NO grain treats have a much different texture, either from being pure meat or using various ingredients as the "binder" necessary for treats like this)<br /><br />This is the only type of treat we feed that has grains in it; almost everything else she eats is pure meat in various fashions. (lamb lung, water buffalo, venison, rabbit, etc)<br /><br />If you have a dog with allergies you may want to try some of the grain-free options for training treats, like the mini lamb lungs or mini beef jerkies, etc. For our needs, though, these are perfect. \<br /><br />I was SO psyched when I saw that they came out with the "rabbit" variety! I try to keep the variety going in her diet and she doesn't like the peanut butter kind so it was always down to alternating between chicken or salmon, both of which are very common proteins. I can't tell if she likes this kind more or not, but she's definitely eating them which is a good sign! They tend to be more expensive than the other variety so I don't buy them as often, but love including it in the mix!<br /><br />One last thing I wanted to mention, my Mom has small dogs (tiny chihuahuas) and they can eat this size training treat with ease. However, I recently purchased the SMALL training treats for her (they are usually about 1/2 cal per treat) and she said that they are PERFECT for her sized dogs that she is constantly trying to diet. I don't believe they are made in that size by Zuke's but there are several brands out there that also use similar ingredients (no bad preservatives, no corn, by products, etc) that may work better for very small dogs.

review/text: Of the Zukes flavors, the New Zealand Rabbit is Pepper's favorite. In fact, she likes it almost too much. When we are in agility class, I limit how much of these she gets, interspersing them with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW">Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats</a>. I also try not to give her these with another dog nearby as she gets a little food defensive (something I need to work on, just not in agility class).<br /><br />The Zukes are good agility treats because they are small enough for a medium size dog to eat without much effort. They also do not crumble, leaving crumbs to distract the next dog. One drawback is that the little cylinder shape means they can roll a long distance if you try to throw them on a spot.

review/text: I have Yorkies so don't give them the entire stick at once. I cut them into about 6 pieces. My dogs LOVE these and will do anything to get one. My dogs are not puppies but of all the chew treats I have tried these are the only ones they like. They will not eat your typical dog bone treats. If you buy  these at Petco they cost twice what I paid for them here and I had them within 4 days.

review/text: Our 16 year-old Tabby usually finds treats/food interesting for a week or so, then he could care less for them.  Not Greenies!  We are at the 6-month mark and he has yet to refuse this treat.  Twice a day we comply with his demands for a hit and toss a few treats into his cubby, AKA crack house.  Gotta get your hand out fast!  Greenies are definately worth the $ for a happy, albeit, addicted cat!

review/text: Who would figure that cats would like something that was actually good for them? I started giving my cat's greenies because of their oral problems. My cats absolutely love them! In fact, they beg for them every day. It's a shame that more stores don't carry these. They're really nice crunchy treats that help scrub cat's teeth to help prevent gingevitis and plaque buildup. A must for any cat owner!

review/text: My cat is fairly finicky and he LOVES these treats.  Agree with the other reviewer- they don't do anything for his breath (one way or another) and I only give him 3-4 at one time, which is sufficient.  But when he sees the bag, he goes crazy.<br /><br />Of course, cats are notoriously individualistic, and your mileage may vary, but there's one happy cat in California who highly recommends these treats.

review/summary: Green Color Mist for a Green Alien Party
review/text: I had so much fun with Wilton's green Color Mist for a green alien party! Remember, it's a MIST, which means it sprays LIGHTLY, so keep that in mind when you want to add just a tint of color to your party foods. For example, it's a great mist for popcorn. I sprayed some of the Kettle Korn green and added regular colored Kettle Korn for a party mix, then added green M&Ms for a sweet and savory mix. The kids loved it. You could use Color Mist to spray marshmallows, white bread, potato chips and any other lightly colored foods to keep with your party theme colors.<br /><br />I'll use the pink color mist for my next party: a pink pirate party, mateys!

I followed the instructions perfectly and it gave it a grayish color only if you sprayed a bunch on.  The smell was awful and it looked awful.  Realizing it wasn't going to work I stopped and tried to scrape it off.  The entire cake absorbed the flavor - it was horrible and the cake ended up in the garbage.

review/summary: Misleading Picture and Description
review/text: This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is "russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA".  Notice that this product title starts with "Alaskan Salmon", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of "Grained Salmon Caviar"  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see "made in USA" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was "sorry I was out of town".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.  However there are still inconsistencies with this product's page, that needs to be pointed out.

review/summary: Not exactly what I ordered...
review/text: As another reviewer has noted, the product description was a bit misleading. I thought I was getting four 7oz jars of Alaskan Salmon Roe. What I received was six small 5oz tins of something purporting to be salmon roe. Most of the writing on the label is in Russian, but it does say "Product of USA." This is all a bit off-putting, as we were planning to give the jars as gifts. Now I guess I'll have to open one one to check things out. The can has a stamp indicating that it was packed only 2 week ago.<br />If the product inside is any good, I'll upgrade this by a star (to 4), if so-so I'll leave it at 3 or maybe 2. If bad, the minimum one star.

review/summary: good food to begin your kittens life
review/text: I have been fostering kittens for a few years now and I think that this is a great food to start out on if you have a tighter budget. I really like the holistic foods, but I think that starting out with this is not too bad. It's not as great for you kitten, but it provides all their necessities and it's not too bad of a brand. All the shelters that I have been to also use this food. I just wanted to note that the higher quality food that you feed your kitten, the less waste they will produce and the general health will increase (shinier coat and etc). I always get this is the big bag because it seems to be the most worth it and this food is not too bad when you can get it on sale. You can also buy these from your local petsmarts so I think it is pretty convenient. Remember to get your pets spayed and neutered as well!! prevent the over accumulation of strays in our shelters and stop overpopulation!!!

review/text: I have two kittens both male persians.  I've been trying different brand kitten foods, including fresh, canned, and dry.  Of all the dried types I have purchased, they like this brand and the Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula.  Each piece of food is small and bite sized for my kitten's little mouths.  Each of my kittens are less than a year old. I like how Hill's uses a portion of the price I paid for this food and donates it through their Shelter Nutrition Partnership.  I'm willing to pay a little more money for the kitten food knowing that a portion is donated to help animals have a more balanced nutrition.  I will purchase this brand again.

review/summary: My kitten loves it - and so does his "big brother"!
review/text: Several weeks ago, I adopted a new kitten, about 6 months old. I figured he would need some food of his own, so I chose Science Diet Indoor kitten food, since he will be an indoor cat. While my two cats were in the "separation" state, I fed the Science Diet to the kitten, and he ate it readily.<br /><br />Then, after I "integrated" the two cats, I had a problem; the older cat decided he liked the kitten food better than his own food. So he wouldn't eat his own food, just the kitten food. I didn't want him eating a lot of kitten food, because it is high in fat and calories, and he is already overweight. But I also wanted my kitten to get some benefit from the kitten food. I tried structured feedings, but it was no use - the older cat would rather go on a hunger strike than eat anything but the kitten food. Boy, it must taste good!<br /><br />I finally ended up mixing the adult food with the kitten food and giving it to both cats. I wish I could feed the kitten the Science Diet exclusively, but oh well, at least he is getting some of it... without my older cat getting a huge amount.

Well, the minute I heard marzipan, I HAD to try it and the rest is history.<br /><br />I often made my own which is roughly the size of a loaf cake and received raves for ''making an especially lush'' cake. BUT I didn't always want the hassle of doing my own. Enter my old chum Mr. Kipling and his exceedingly good cakes. Yes, they are and I was known to hide away with a box of 5 little Battenbergs, polishing them off in an evening. I am so happy to see them here. They are very sweet and worth every ounce!<br /><br />Positively addictive!

review/text: We stumbled across Mr. Kipling's Mini Battenbergs 5 Pack on a recent trip to Scotland. They are incredibly moist and flavorful -- the almond paste wrap is what really makes them, but the cake itself is excellent, and the little bit of apricot jam between the squares is the crowning touch. They are pretty as well. Each battenberg could be sliced in squares and served at a tea party. My opinion is that once you taste one, they won't be around long enough to serve to guests.

review/text: I love Battenburg cakes so much that I make them myself and they come out perfect every time. A few months ago I found a website called Fantes, they sell Battenburg cake tins, yeah! They sell so many kitchen things.<br /><br />You go on the Fantes site select 'Cake Pans'. Choose 'Square and Rectangular Pans'. Keep scrolling down until you see a picture of a Battenburg Cake, with the pink and yellow squares. It will say 'Silverwood Battenburg Cake Pan'. If you like to bake you'll love these. I bought two, and put them side by side, in my Euro Pro convection oven, which is a bit larger than the usual roaster toaster oven. I'd searched for years until I came accross these cake pans.<br /><br />If you're not into baking, try these ready made Battenburg cakes, you won't be disappointed, they are absolutely delicious. The yummy sponges stuck together with jam and covered with marzipan, Mmmmm your in for a treat. I'm making my mouth water!<br /><br />The chefs of the British Royal family were introduced to the German style of cake making during Queen Victoria reign. The first Battenburg cake was made in that German style to celebrate the wedding of Queen Victoria's Granddaughter's Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, and was named after her husband to be Prince Louis of Battenburg.<br /><br />These yummy Battenburg cakes are readily available all over the UK in supermarkets. I'm happy to see them here on Amazon.

review/text: What can I say - these little cakes are very tasty. Like other reviewers have said, it's the marzipan that makes them. So good. I purchased a box to try not knowing how they tasted. Wasn't sure if they'd be stale and nasty like some of the imported treats can be. They were very moist. Looked up some recipes online and am going to try to make my own Battenberg cake. A little pricey, but for a quick fix, these won't disappoint!

review/summary: Delicious Valentine's Day Gift
review/text: I got these as a Valentine's Day gift for my wife, who says they were delicious.  For those unfamiliar with Battenberg cakes, each of these consists of four little sponge cakes glued together in a checkerboard pattern with jam and the whole thing is covered with almond paste.  These have been popular with afternoon tea in the UK for many years.

review/summary: AWESOME!!!
review/text: These snails are awesome.  They are the best tasting escargot I have ever had, at any restaurant, anywhere.  I was worried that the giant snails might be too big, and they are larger than any I had ever seen.  But they are so tender that you can just bite right through them.  These are delicious and I am waiting for amazon to get more in stock so I can order more.  I prepared some on a family vacation and parents, cousins, uncles, aunts were all raving over them...even people who didn't know they liked escargot!  And, by the way, this 12-pack is the best deal on earth.  Order the $5 HIC escargot plate with them, find a butter recipe online, buy some crostinis at the grocery store and enjoy.  The little plate fits in my toaster oven and I have wonderful escargot in 5 minutes.

review/summary: Unbelievable !!!
review/text: If you were to imagine the biggest, sweetest, most tender escargot in the universe, you'd still be pleasantly surprised after opening a can of these lovelies and baking them gently.<br /><br />I'm an escargot lover and also a Yankee. The combination of those 2 things has made it hard for me to order escargot in a restaurant.  I have on occasion, but $10. for 6 tiny, albeit tasty morsels has caused minor pangs in my Yankee heart. Add to that the trend in the US for more casual dining and even finding escargot on the menu now is less likely than it was 10 years ago.  So, not a big deal. Life goes on...no snails for Jo Ana.<br /><br />Until now.  I was doing some grocery shopping on Amazon the other day and discovered the Subscribe and Save program. While checking it out I found the Roland Giant Snails and ordered a box of them, hoping for the best but not expecting the largest snails I've ever seen in my life times 2 !!  I'm not a big eater, but 6 of these with a small vegetable portion is dinner for me.  I bake them with organic extra virgin coconut oil heavily laced with garlic and WOW !  My first bite reminded me how much I love escargot and the rest of the bites made me very very happy that I'm an Amazon customer who happened upon the Save & Subscribe program!<br /><br />If you love escargot, you will be very pleasantly surprised with the size, taste and overall yumminess of this product !

review/summary: Simply the best
review/text: If you truly enjoy eating then you will truly enjoy escargot; even though you may not know it if you have never tasted.  If you love and enjoy escargot, then I promise you that you will absolutely love this product.  These puppies are BIG!  Now I know that big does not always mean better, but I have to say I have never tasted better and I have eaten these things in many restaurants, in many homes and locations around the world. I come from several generations of snail lovers and we are all pretty picky!<br /><br />These snails are tender, not mushy as you often find and if prepared correctly can send you into a state of gastronomic nirvana.  A bit of EVOO, garlic and a touch of salt, a dash of wine and a hot oven and you have pure heaven at the table.<br /><br />I cannot believe the price here on Amazon.  I buy this same product at a local store and can assure you that I pay much, much more.<br /><br />As one reviewer has pointed out, it is very difficult to find these in many restaurants these days.  When I was a little girl, traveling with my parents all over the U.S. it was not much of a problem.  Times have changed though and if you want a `snail fix,' you are quite often forced to do it yourself.  Fortunately that is not difficult if you have a quality product to begin with.  It this case, you do.<br /><br />Whether you buy here on Amazon or buy locally, don't let these slip by you.

review/summary: Roland Giant Snails - Most Excellent
review/text: Based on reviews, we ordered a case.  These are awesome, just as indicated by others.  Delicious when heated with garlic/shallot butter; very tender and GIANT.  Very minor issues: (1) There were 16 in the can we opened.  Since I assume sold/packed by weight and not number, would have been even larger if only 12. (2) strong sulfur smell when opening the can, but easily rinsed off and not apparent in heated snails. (3) I had assumed, apparently incorrectly, country of origin was France.  Packaging (but not web site) indicates from Indonesia; I hope better than food coming from China!  We will order again.
