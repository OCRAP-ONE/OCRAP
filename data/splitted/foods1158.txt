review/summary: Great BBQ sauce
review/text: I used this sauce with chicken in my crock pot. I used only the chicken thighs and the sauce, and it came out terrific. My husband complimented the recipe, which says something because he's a fan of BBQ. I have also tried the Organcville Teriyaki sauce with excellent results. These sauces are perfect for a very easy, very quickly-prepared meal using almost any type of meat.

review/summary: So much easier on my babies tummy.
review/text: When we switch my daughter from nursing to eating her first solid foods we started with rice cereal.  The misery that caused will be forever emblazoned on my memory.  Colic, gas, and it backed her up right proper.<br /><br />My wife and I started researching alternatives on the Internet.  We found a bunch of references to how Barley was easier on a tummy.  That Barley soup/broth is often what is given to people recovering in hospitals etc...  I went to every local store looking for some.  Family and friends that had used it used to buy it locally.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  I found it here on Amazon and bought this pack of 12 boxes.<br /><br />We found rather strongly that this was much easier on my daughters tummy.  She continued to eat without distress after we made the switch.  We started using it just as cereal and then as she got older we started using it as a thickening agent and filler when mixed with pureed vegetables etc...  She liked things better when they were less runny and we liked things better when she was happy.<br /><br />We will be ordering more here shortly for the twins that have now joined our family.  For us it worked great.  I really do recommend it as a far better option that rice cereal.

review/summary: Always have this on hand
review/text: I keep Gerber 'Mixed' and 'Barley' on hand all the time. The 'mixed' consists of rice, oat and wheat so I mix a box of that with a box of the 'barley' and have a completely balanced breakfast cereal. I don't use it for people: I keep it handy for when the dogs have upset tummies and their regular food is too harsh on their digestive systems and they need soft, easy to digest food that fills them up and is healthy for them.  As their tummies return to normal, I reduce the baby cereal a bit and add in some of their normal foods and as they continue to improve, the baby cereal gets reduced while their normal foods eventually return to full bore.<br /><br />This is good for them, too, after dental cleanings/extractions, surgeries, when they need a little help in the 'bowel' department (fiber), or just as an added treat to change it up a bit in their daily diet.<br /><br />I have used this in place of bread crumbs when making a meatloaf (ok, I was desperate), but didn't care for the texture of the meatloaf once cooked. It was too soft for our liking, but still quite tasty.

review/summary: CC Sumatra Dark Roast
review/text: I tried several brands of coffee before settling on this one.  There's a lot of taste and almost no bitterness with this blend, and I've been quite happy with it.  I usually tend toward the quite dark, expresso roasts, but I've been finding that the bitterness in the followthrough has been ruining things for me.  If you like Starbucks, you will probably not like this coffee - but I gave up Starbucks as overly roasted (burned, really) and sour years ago.  This coffee is smooth with lots of taste, but easy drinking enough for multiple cups.  I usually can't drink coffee black, because I make it strong, but I can drink this black without any problems.  I'm quite impressed with the product, and with Ship and Save, it's even more attractive.

I am no coffee afficiando but I do know what I do and don't like and this is a re-buy once I finish.

Will definitely keep this on subscription, as the price cannot be beat anywhere near me.  Even mediocre coffee costs $7 or more per bag in the stores.

review/text: I was pleased when Amazon decided to sell Community Coffee since I long ago decided it was the best of the rich, strong flavored Louisiana coffees.  The private reserve coffees Community Coffee sells are quite good, just as I remembered them being when I lived in Baton Rouge many, many years ago.  Community Coffees offer a consistently rich, flavorful roast.  The price is reasonable especially with Amazon's subscribe and save program.  I make my own blends of Sumatran, French Roast, Columbian and Espresso and am very happy with the results.

review/text: I have edited my review three times. My first order-I was very surprised to find an improperly sealed package. Amazon responded promptly and replaced the coffee. The first batch had 2 sealed and one unsealed bag. The sealed bags tasted old from that shipment. The beans were dried out looking and the coffee bland. The replacement shipment was very good. I liked the coffee in the second shipment alot. It was full flavored and the beans were shiny and in good condition. I reordered this coffee and hoped it was an unusual event in their quality control.I subscribed to delivery service. Unfortunately the next batch was stale tasting, not vacuum packed and dry looking beans. Sadly I canceled the subscription. The quality is very inconsistent. At it's best it is great , and at it's worst - tastes very stale.

review/summary: Baby Mum-Mum Vegetable Flavored Rice Rusks
review/text: I discovered these at Walmart and then purchased them in bulk at Amazon (a much better savings).  I was reluctant to try them at first.  I was searching for biter biscuits or zwieback toast when our daughter started teething but was having a difficult time finding such products and when I did they were never on sale.  I stumbled upon the Baby Mum-Mum products at Walmart, they were affordable and conveniently packaged.  Our daughter LOVES THEM.  She knows the package and gets excited when you pull one out.  I love that they are wrapped in two packs also, you don't have to waste a baggie packing them to go and they don't go stale.  We bring them with us to restaurants and it's a great way to keep her busy and get in a healthy snack while we are waiting for the food to come...a lifesaver!  I think it is also important to mention that they contain vegetables and are tagged as "organic" I don't hold a lot of importance in finding organics products because of the price but am happy when I can afford them.  Also, I've found that many snacks for babies/children (such as Gerber Graduates line) are loaded with extra sugar which I believe is unnecessary.  The fruit snacks have twice as much sugar as normal fruit snacks off the shelf.  So I'm happy to find a product such as a Mum Mum which doesn't contain a lot of excess sugars.

review/summary: Healthy Alternative to Gerber Puffs and Such
review/text: When my child was starting to learn to self-feed, people always recommended Gerber Puffs and other types of airy/puffy easily dissolved food for babies.  The problem is that these snacks are processed, full of preservatives and artificial flavors and colors- pretty much Cheetos for babies!  I saw these at a local store and tried them based on another mom's recommendation, and my little has loved them ever since!  They don't make a mess like other teething biscuits, dissolve easily, and are made of natural ingredients.  These are especially handy if your little one has diarrhea, since rice is easy to digest and firms up the stools.  The taste of this is mild, similar to Rice Krispies, and like I said, the little one LOVES them.  I would tell any new mom to try these as a healthy way for their child to start self-feeding.

review/summary: Mum-Mums...  Yay
review/text: If you are starting baby on finger foods, these are a must try.  They dissolve easily in the mouth and our baby loves them.  She can hold the shape/size easily in her hands.  They're also great for on-the-go because they come in individually packaged sets of 2.  I give them to her in the grocery store as a little distraction snack and she's happy as can be.  Just a note: they are really sticky so may want to have a wipe on hand.  Also, they are great ingredients-wise... no preservatives or other yucky stuff that you have to look up on the internet to see if it's safe!  They can be hard to find locally, so stock up if baby likes them.

review/summary: My daughter's favorite cracker.
review/text: These are wrapped in packages of two, so it's easy to toss a pack or two in my purse, my daughter's backpack or her lunchbox.  They melt in your mouth, so they're great for babies learning to eat solids.  We also keep them handy for when the kids aren't feeling well because they're bland and easy on the tummy.

review/summary: Perfect for teethers
review/text: I happened upon these recently at Walmart and thought I'd give them a try for my 9 month old daughter (we tried the veggie variety). She absolutely loves them! They are easy to chew - they sort of dissolve in baby's mouth making it the perfect first snack for those early eaters. They come wrapped (two packs) which makes them perfect for on the go. I have recommended them to other parents and will continue to buy them for my little one, even after she's eating more and more solids.

review/text: these are awful, my 7 month old did not like them and eevn when I threw them out to the birds they didn't even eat them. What bothered me also is that they weren't even made in the U.S.A. I was surprised that Earth's Best had a low rating. She loved them, she was able to hold on to them better than these, they didnt just dissolve away like nothing. the Earth's Best is a million times better.

review/summary: Baby food product made in Mainland China? No thanks.
review/text: If I had known this baby food product was made in Mainland China, I would not have ordered it.<br />We refuse to give our baby this product due to the negative publicity plastered all over the news associated with tainted infant formula and other food products made in Mainland China. I own other items made in China but food products are something that I refuse to consume.<br /><br />I went back and re-read the description on the Amazon.com website and did not see a product origin. Isn't there a disclosure requirement for retailers to disclose from where products they sell are made? (silly me!)<br /><br />We both ate packs of the rice crackers while I did whatever research I could on the factory in Guangzhou, China that made this rice cracker. Not much came out of my simple desktop research -<br />1) a letter from the FDA regarding claims on the box: [...];<br />2) import refusal letter from FDA:<br />[...]<br /><br />Funny thing, the rice crackers actually taste good. And, I am still around to write this review. However, in my kitchen, I have six boxes of Baby crackers that I will probably not eat.<br /><br />In the mean time, I will search for and purchase a baby teething cracker made some where other than Mainland China. Maybe I'll walk to a local Wholefoods rather than buy baby products from Amazon.com.

review/summary: Great Brand from Taiwan
review/text: My husband and I came from Taiwan and have been living in the US for over 15 years. Normally we only buy Chinese snacks that are brand names and made in US or Taiwan. However, I was very glad to find this product in Amazon even though I just bought it today and haven't yet received it. I do know "Hot Kid" very well and used to have it for snack growing up in Taiwan. It was one of my few favorite snacks made by a well reputed Taiwanese company. I trust this brand just as I do General Mills or Kraft. It was already a major food company in Taiwan back then and "rice rusk" was the most popular product. Now, this company has made its way to becoming one of the three biggest food companies in China. Interesting enough, these three companies are all Taiwanese companies. I think the main reason is that people in China do not trust their own brands. I believe that "Hot Kid"is a quality food product. I think the worry is overdone and the red flag is unnecessary. My son is 7 months now and it was a pleasing surprise to have found this product in US.

review/summary: Great Snack for New Eaters
review/text: These are great for little ones who are just started to get teeth or are new to eating solids. These crackers sort of just dissolve in your mouth. I was always nervous about chunks breaking off of the hard teething biscuits. These were a snack I could give without any concern at all. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the sugar content is a bit high.<br /><br />Also, we ordered a case from Amazon in April that expires in the beginning of August which is coming upon us quickly. I don't know if these have a short "life expectancy" or if Amazon had them sitting around a while. The product isn't stale or anything it's just a case is a lot to go through in just a few months.

review/summary: My son would probably eat 5 million of these at a sitting if we let him!
review/text: They are great for a quick on the go snack for a baby. They come wrapped two to a pack, so you can either give your child both of them or nibble on one if you're feeling desperate.<br /><br />They taste pleasant enough to me (not a strong flavor but light and a sort of fluffy crunch if that makes any sense), but they are like baby crack. I have yet to meet a baby that didn't love mum-mums. They are fabulous for teething-- in fact they helped us avoid numbing gels and pain killers during teething. They are also a fantastic find for snacks/distractions during grocery shopping or car rides (these saved us during a 14 hour train trip when our son was 8 months old).<br /><br />If you aren't sure, try a single box from a store. Your child will almost undoubtedly love them. Then come back here to stock up! The last time Amazon had a discount code for mum mums we bought 4 cases, and I'm kicking myself for not buying more already!

We've tried every flavor and honestly it doesn't seem to matter to my daughter. I ordered the veggie flavor just to see if it would be more cracker like flavor wise than the banana or plain, but she just gobbles them right up. If I don't watch out my husband eats them as well sometimes and the dog eats the little mushy pieces of mum mum that baby leaves behind.

review/text: We've only tried the vegetable version but my 6 month old loves it. It dissolves right when you bite it, and she enjoys holding it and putting it in her mouth. I only gave it 3 stars because it is no different from the rice crackers they sell at the Asian groceries. I thought I was getting a good deal on Amazon, but the ones at the Asian groceries are only 2-3 bucks a package. I agree with a previous poster that this company uses an awful lot of packaging. It's a nuisance especially since there is so much eco-awareness nowadays.<br /><br />BTW, my two year old loves these too so I always have them handy in the trunk of the car. These will get crushed in your diaper bag, so stash somewhere safe :)

The taste is mild, and babies are so happy to be able to self feed!  Plus, if you are in a silly mood, you can make all sorts of rhymes and word play to entertain your baby.  "Mum-Mum's MMMM Yum-Yum..."  My son has been eating this since about 5.5 months.  They are packaged in little pockets of two, so you can slip one in your purse and pull it out in case of emergency.  My third baby get's dragged along to board meetings at my son's preschool, PTO meeting's and fundraisers at my daughters elementary school, and every where else I go, so I love how convienient they are.  Unlike Cheerio's and other lose pieces, I don't have to worry that they are going to be dropped all over the place, and unlike biter bicuits they don't make him all messy faced.

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: I LOVE these as a snack for my baby, and use them mostly when on the go since baby can hold them himself.  I keep them in my car and offer them to him when shopping, in church or other errands.  GREAT for a stroller snack when on walks/run.  Rather than puffs where they go all over and he is always grabbing and vocalizing for more, these keep his hands and mouth busy for a good while.  And he feels grown up to be feeding himself.  They are "individually packaged" with two rusks/pack which is great, because like most good things one is never enough!  He always wants one more.<br /><br />Baby liked banana flavor just fine, but I'm partial to the veggie and since he likes them, and I always end up taking a nibble or two, I just get veggie now :)<br /><br />The only reason it is 4 stars not 5 is because mum mum + baby saliva = cement.  Best to clean his hands and pick up any dropped pieces before they get uber sticky and harden.  That said, once dry the pieces do chip off clothes or stroller/carseat material easily with your nail.

review/summary: way better than puffs for my baby;  but won't ship to APO
review/text: My baby just loves these - she's 8 months and just really started to know how to chew.  We tried the puffs, but they were too small.  Also Mums are good car snacks, cause she doesn't have to hold a cup AND try to put small puffs into her mouth.  Just discovered these this Christmas while visiting in the states.  We live in Germany.  We're with the military, and our commissary doesn't have these so I tried to order from Amazon.  They only ship mum mums to 48 contiguous states.  I tried drug store dot com and they shipped no problem, though! Yay! Baby's gonna be happy.

review/summary: baby approved
review/text: Both my children love these and I love that they are made with some veggies. These are a great snack, easy for the babe to hold, and don't make a mess. However, they are fragile and if you're not careful about how you store them in the diaper bag, they will break easily. The ONLY reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because sugar is still one of the top ingredients (although don't taste sugary) and they use a tremendous amount of packaging. A pair is individually wrapped in plastic, then all 12 pair are wrapped in another plastic package, and finally enclosed in a box. The brand could do better to have less impact on the environment w/ their packaging. Overall, love this product. It's a staple for my baby.

review/summary: 7 month old LOVES them!
review/text: A friend recommended these, and my daughter loves them! They're great because they dissolve quickly. I think she learned how to eat solids with these -- they're big enough for her to hold before she could pick things up with two fingers, and she would just suck/gnaw on them (she also didn't have teeth yet, so she wasn't breaking off pieces when she first started eating them). She would get SO EXCITED when she'd hear me opening a pack of them! I also used them to get veggies and other nourishing foods in here when she was putting up a stink and wouldn't eat them. I'd wait for her to open her mouth for the Mum Mum, and then I'd stick a spoonfull of veggies in her mouth. She didn't seem to care because she was getting her Mum Mum! She's getting to smart for that trick now, but it worked for a while! Just a heads up -- when she first started eating them, she stuck the end of the piece in her mouth a couple times, which was too big. As with all solid foods, make sure you're with them when they're eating. I'm a big fan!

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: I've tried so many Teething Cookies... The gerber ones are a joke, They just "crumble" in the baby's mouth and leave a goo on my little one's hands.  The Earth's best ones are hard, and doesn't crumble but the goo is always every where. These rice rucks are awesome, they will melt, they come off in bits and doesn't crumble in my lttile one's mouth.  Her hands are not full of cookie goo.<br />It's inexpensive.  I grew up eating the same kind of product from Hot Kids in Hong Kong and in the States. So i trust this company.  I'm just like any other moms, looking for the best product for your little one. If you are looking for a snack that your little one can hold and wont make a mess. this is it! we tried all the baby mum mum flavors. I usually go with the organic ones. but i do switch it up!<br />also, it doesn't constipate her. because is rice. and they eat rice cereal anyway!<br />If you don't want to buy 6, you can go to babysrus or target. "target is the cheapest its less than 3$" buy one box, and you wil be hooked! just make sure to look at the label that says BABY or Toddler.<br />hope this helps!

review/summary: MIC is fine, but THE NUTRITION FACTS are not
review/text: Some people are concerned about this product being made in China, personally I think it's fine, since it's from the largest rice cracker manufacturer in the world, they should have decent quality control systems-- after all, the ingredients from the frightening food scandals in China never appears in any of their product that's made in China. (Interestingly, some of their adult rice snacks made in Taiwan were involved).<br /><br />However, I hope I've read the nutrition facts before purchasing this product:it has sugar and sodium. Baby food are not supposed to have sugar and salt added into it. THEY ARE FOR ADULTS! Especially, the sodium per serving for this product is about 2/3 the value for reduce fat potato chips. Since you cannot return grocery purchases on Amazon, think twice before you buy this. My daughter is 8 months old, I'll probably give her this after she's 12 months old -- since I cannot return this anyway, but I won't give her too much in a day simply because of they added salt into this product.

review/summary: So delicious kids love them!  But made in China
review/text: Such a good deal through Amazon, and if you subscribe, even better.  However, my husband made me get rid of them upon learning they're made in China.  What with all the fake milk, fake eggs, fake everything they put into baby food, even though I'm 99% sure these are fine (they gotta be, right?  I mean, they're made for export!), you never know with Chinese products.<br /><br />In this day and age I don't trust made in China anything for things my child can put in his mouth, drink, ingest, lick, breathe in, bite, bathe in, wash with, etc.<br /><br />But it's delicious.  I snacked on these too when we went to the park and we're both fine.  I still give these four stars for the taste and packaging.  So if you don't care about made in China, I recommend!<br /><br />But we're listening to daddy to be safe than sorry.

review/text: I am a mother to 3 children under the age of 3 and have always been worried about my little one's choking on those first "finger food" crackers. I tried Mum's Mum's because my daughter has many food allergies and these were made of rice. She loves it. My son Jacob is 11 months old and absolutely devours these snacks. In fact, his very first word was not "mamma" but "mum mum". Hmmm....highly recommend this product. P.S. Not messy like other first crackers, biscuits or cookies.

review/summary: Best "No Mess" Snack Ever!
review/text: We started feeding these to our baby when he was around ten months old and he loved them right from the start.  He is now 13 months old and I have to say, I love them better than the puff snacks, (although he likes those also), but these don't make the mess like the little puff snacks do.  Baby holds on to the cracker and eats it, rather than dumping a bowl of puffs all on the floor, half of which usually end up getting vaccumed up.  We think these are the best value for the buck as there is less waste, he enjoys them and best of all, no mess!

I couldn't find veggie flavored in the store, only the original flavor.  Buying these on subscribe and save makes them cheaper than in the store anyway, so, yay!  I took off one star because these turn into paste when wet, so they stick everywhere.  You will need a wet cloth nearby to clean up your baby and likely the area they are eating in.  I don't know of any baby so far that doesn't like these.  When my daughter goes through one pack she goes crazy for seconds.

review/text: I first purchased this because my son, who was about 8 months old, was diagnosed with milk, eggs and soy allergies. Not too many products out there for kids with allergies, and this was a great find. My 5 year old decided to try (maybe out of that sibling rivalry feeling), and now it is almost all they want for snack. Which is a great thing, since it is on the healthy side, particularly the vegetable flavored one. I love hearing the crackling sound of my baby enjoying his snack, and it is pretty portable since it is individually wrapped, great for car rides. Just be careful how you transport it since it breaks off easily. I usually have a box in the car, ready for anything.

These were the perfect solution and my daughter loves them.  She is going to be one soon, still only has four teeth and still eats these like they're her favorite treat.  All she has to see is the wrapped package and she starts babbling like crazy!
