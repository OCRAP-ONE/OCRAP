review/summary: Great price Great escargots
review/text: Bought two cases, did not realize it was 12 in a case.  Tried three cans, large escargots, delicious, just make up butter seasoning,a drop of wine (optional), put in baking dish and bake at 10 min in 400 degree over.  Voila! Great appetizer and great price.  Gave 1/2 dozen to sister as a present - she loved them, I love them.  Can imagine sitting on the Champs, eating a dozen with baguettes.

review/summary: great escargots
review/text: I ordered the escargots in January and thought I had ordered two cans and when they arrived I had twelve cans.  I kept them and am really glad that I did.  We have already used several of them.  They are very good and so easy to fix for a quick appetizer.  I rate these a 4 1/2 out of 5.

review/summary: Just an OK product
review/text: These giant snails hail from Indonesia and hardly fit into the traditional escargot plate. As compared to the french versions, these are tougher and not as tender. And with the size, it does take time for these to absorb in the marinade or sauces. A different way of cooking may be needed to create a tasty dish out of this.<br /><br />As I prefer smaller escargots so that it can fit into the escargot plate, I chanced upon another Indonesian equivalent product, Jans Escargots. Though they are still tougher than the french versions, due to their inherent petite size, they are able to blend into the marinade or sauces quicker. I obtained this from the Chinese supermarket in San Jose, CA and is priced under $2 for close to 2 dozen pieces.

review/summary: Great service and product
review/text: I was so pleased to find the 1 dozen size Roland brand escargot.  This brand is carried in our very gourmet grocery store but in a 2 dozen size quantity.  My husband and are have spent time in France and are escargot fans but can't eat more than 6 snails each. I was reluctant to freeze the remainder of an open 2 doz can - the 1 doz. size is perfect.  They are delicious prepared in a simple garlic/butter/parley sauce and baked in special escargot dishes I purchased at the same time. I did not use the shells that can also be purchased for that purpose.<br /><br />The order was sent promtly and I would buy this product again.

review/text: I like to order escargot in the restaurant but I've been out of America and Europe so have been unable to lately. I asked my wife to send me some, and this was the brand she bought at Publix. Having said that it took me a long time to finally try them because I didn't have an escargot pan. When I finally did try them I used them in an alfredo sauce over pasta with shrimp, the escargot were restaurant quality, and in all likelihood the same kind they use! Highly recommended, they are tender with good taste. Ordering through Amazon looks a lot cheaper too!

review/summary: Roland Giant Snails (12 Per Can) 7.75-Ounce Cans (Pk of 12)
review/text: Let me start by saying... OMG! We just recieved these a couple hours ago and I just couldn't wait to jump in a try these little guys out! The title and previous reviews are dead on when they say HUGE! These escargot are the biggest that I have ever seen! They pack some serious flavor though. You would think that because they are so big they would loose some of their flavor and the ability to retain outside flavors but not in this case! My husband simmered them in some white wine for about 8-10 minutes on med-high heat. We then placed them in our new "HIC Whiteware Porcelain 6-1/2-Inch Footed Escargot Plate" with a butter mixture (butter, parsley, garlic). They were then topped with some provolone cheese and placed in the oven at 400 for 15 minutes. They were wonderful! The escargot pulled in so much of the butter mixture and retained that flavor so perfectly. My husband who is a very picky eater actually liked them! I will say though, I am not a big eater so after a couple bites of anything I am usually finished. If you can not eat a lot then I would suggest maybe getting some smaller escargot instead of these GIANT ones if you plan on eating for small families. We had to give atleast a good 8ish to our neighboors because we just couldn't eat another bite! So these will not be good for us to have as just the two of us but definitely when we have dinner parties! All in all, I am very pleased with our purchase and will purchase again!

These make for a delicious appetizer that may in fact be better flavor, quality, and size than is found in most restaurants.  Of course, when it comes to value this pack cannot be beat.  Additionally, because these snails are canned, they last a very long time so you do not have to worry about spoilage.  If you love escargot, do not hesitate to order.

review/summary: Bigger is better
review/text: These snails are of a good quality at a much better price than I have seen them elsewhere.<br />The reason for the lower rating in the stars is that there is the non advertised inclusion of pepper, not enough to be hot but just enough to create a bit of a bitter taste, even with rinsing. They are much better than the smaller size `very large' cans of snails of the same brand.<br />At an even better level are the helix escargot if you really want to taste a higher quality.<br />These do not have to be stuffed into shells, I simply put them in a small oven proof bowl, after rinsing well and shaking the water off in a colander - with chives, garlic, bits, a tiny bit of garlic salt and place pats of butter on top, pop them into a 375 degree oven for 15 minutes and they are ready.<br />Hopefully one thing that has improved and that I did not make part of the qualification for my review was the packing, it was done very poorly and many of the cans were dented on the bottom - they were replaced, but be sure to check your whole package if you order them.

We have found that using ghee (cooked clarified butter), garlic and plenty of fresh parsley and sauteeing the snails quickly gives better results than baking them in shells -- and it's a LOT easier!  For a perfect combination, use them to top a small serving of pasta (we use Tinkyada brand rice pasta or Vita Spelt pasta)

review/summary: It Works for My Poor, Old Cat
review/text: I used to use litter crystals and then switched to clay when I could get a 40-lb box at BJ's for just $8.99.  I used the clay litter with those sifting liners and all was well.<br /><br />Well, as my little guy is now over 10 years old, he's gotten funny in his ways.  He seems to like to get in his box and toss litter all over the place before . . . uh . . . handling his business.  That was making my bathroom a mess.  I'd have to sweep and mop before putting down my bath mat to take a bath and it was just too much so this week I switched back to crystals.  Yippee!<br /><br />The low tracking is what does it for me.  For the few crystals that get out of the box, it's no issue to clean up quickly.  No fine dust to contend with.  The solid litter is a breeze to remove and I stir about twice a day, usually when I'm already in the bathroom and notice he's gone.  I mean, you can't even tell I have a cat in the house.  Zero odor, little tracking and easy to clean.  The only thing I do is use a liner with it so that whatever liquid does get through doesn't seep into the plastic over time and stink it up.  The simple fact that this litter is lighter overall is just wonderful.  Less mess and less dust make it a winner.<br /><br />I would LOVE if I could buy this product in a 40-lb box so I could keep it on hand instead of buying small bags.  But I can't say yet if it will last a full month.  I bought a 4-lb bag and I imagine it will last a couple weeks at best.  However, I'm setting a reminder in Outlook and in 3 weeks I'll give you the honest results.

review/summary: best litter EVER
review/text: this product is the best litter I have ever tried, and I have tried them all.  there is NO SMELL at all (besides the light clean fragrance of the crystals) and no scooping up clumps of wet, urine soaked clay that never dries and constantly smells.  while yes it may be a bit more expensive than other litters, I don't have to keep refilling my litter box ever time I scoop it.  I fill it once and don't have to replace it for a whole month.  that means I end up saving loads of money.  and for someone with multiple cats in a small one bedroom apartment, saving money on pet supplies and having a clean fresh smelling home is worth its weight in gold.  did I mention there is NO SMELL?  you would never know I had cats upon entering my apartment whereas with other litters people wouldn't even be through the door when they would say "oh, you have cats, don't you?".  best litter EVER!

review/summary: LOVE fresh step products!
review/text: When I had just one cat, I considered this to be the best product ever invented. This product absorbs all of the urine in such a way that it doesn't clump and the peed on litter is still usable. The litter doesn't stick to the poop which is awesome because I can just scoop out the poop and flush it down the toilet, which cannot be done with clay or clumping litters.  Much less scooping is required as the urine doesn't need to be removed. All thats needed once the poop is removed is some stirring of the urine stained crystals. My cats love this stuff and with one cat I only have to do a complete litter change every 2 months! As far as the scent goes, there is no smell to it at all! It's such a wonderful change of pace! No more worrying about embarrassing litter box odors! I recommend this product to everyone with only one or two cats as it changed my life. My house no longer has that filthy litter stink smell to it. Guests who visit don't even know I have a cat by the smell of my house. It really is a great product! And no, I don't work for fresh step, lol.<br />  The reason why I keep saying it's an ideal litter for one cat is because I have rescued 3 now, and with that many pee's a day, the urine kind of pools up in the corner if you don't do complete litter changes often. I never had this problem with only one cat. Now I buy Fresh Step Extreme Oder Control Scoopable Cat Litter. Because the urine does clump up, I do have to sift the litter much more often. However, due to the high frequency use of the litter boxes it actually keeps it cleaner to remove the clumps as apposed to leaving it in there to collect and pool up. Also, the scoopable kind does stick to the poop so it cannot be flushed. The oder control is just as awesome with the scoop able as it is with the crystals. However, the scoopable puts off a fresh smell that I just love, whereas the crystals had no smell at all.<br />  In conclusion, they are both great products. Crystals are ideal for one cat, but you may want to consider the scoopable if you have several cats. Hope this helped! =)<br /><br />PS- most fresh step litters have something called "paw points" on or in the box. You can collect these and enter them online to get free coupons or cat item rewards!

review/summary: Never Going Back
review/text: Having used clumping clay litter for two years for my older cat, I was tired of the dust and smell. I got a kitten, so that meant double the scooping. I decided to try the Fresh Step crystal litter and I will never go back. Both cats like it, I only use one litter box (though I scoop the poop and rake it twice a day) and I have never had an "accident." No dust, no smell. It seems to dry up the hard waste very quickly so it minimizes the smell and the mess when scooping, and the urine just disappears. Since I use the Litter Locker disposal system, I appreciate that I fill it up more slowly and therefore use fewer bags because there are no urine clumps to dispose of, just solids. I also like the fact that an 8 lb bag is enough for almost two pan refills (I use the extra large pan) and I am not hurting my back lugging it home from the store!

However, I came across this litter at the store and thought I would give it a try. Am I glad I did! Not only does it absorb the liquids and the odors... it last longer than other litters and I don't need to keep re-filling it after each scooping. Now I just need Amazon to carry it so I can order it online, as its slightly difficult to find commercially.

review/text: After debating about using crystals, I finaly decided to give the product a try and boy am I glad I did.  I went to Walmart to do a price comparision and 8lbs of Fresh Step was $14.00, so I looked at the other crystal products and found MiMi crystals 4bls for $4.14.  I was using traditional non-clumping clay litter, it worked fine but had alot of dust and lets face it, clay is dirty.  So I bought the MiMi crystal litter, I thought for only $4.14 I'd give it a try.  I will never go back to clay, my indoor/outdoor cat took to it right away and did his thing, I went to take a look about an hour later and the entire pee was dried up, it was like magic.  Crystals also have virtuly no dust, no fragrance, look pretty and WORK!!!

review/summary: Best litter to date
review/text: I agree with all the comments about this litter being easier to scoop and dispose of in the toilet. I have four cats and I change the box out around every 2 weeks. The litter does not stick to the box which makes it so much easier to clean. I used to have to rinse out the box to get the stinky clumps off of it. Now it's a cinch! And it really does absorb the smells better than any other brand i've tried. This product is more pricey but it's a lot cheaper at other stores then online and well worth it:)

review/summary: No Lasting Power
review/text: I tried this litter at the suggestion on someone's suggestion in the grocery. It lasted a long time for him and his multi-cat household and locked in all the odors.  Unfortunately, it didn't work well for me.  Kitty didn't mind it and there was no dust flying up when I scooped out the stinky solids and fluffed the litter(huge plus), but if I didn't change it every 5-7 days, the yellow-soaked grains would start to smell stale and then downright stinky.  The stuff costs too much for that.  I tried Fresh Step Extreme instead and that stuff is amazing.  Of course, I have to contend with the dust, but again, Kitty doesn't mind it and it smells fresh and masks the odors of the waste as I remove it.  I only change it once every 3-4 weeks, but I do clean her box everytime she uses it.

review/summary: My cats won't use it!
review/text: I got this litter because the store was out of my normal litter, and this one was less expensive than my normal litter, so I thought I would give it a try. I have two boxes (for my two cats), so I left the old litter in one box and stopped cleaning that one, then put Fresh Step Crystals in the other box. Theoretically, when the old box got gross enough, they would switch over to the new litter. Well, instead, they decided to switch over to going on the floor, next to the litter boxes. So gross. Needless to say I switched back to my old litter.<br /><br />I did notice these crystals feel a little sharp, so I don't know if my cats didn't use it because it hurts their paws or something. Or if it just looks too weird for them to be comfortable with. I have no clue if this litter tracks, or locks in odor, or if there is anything good about it. If my cat's won't use it, there is really no point.

review/text: Silica litter has to be the best because it absorbs pee! And cats pee a lot more than they poop, so your litter box chore is greatly reduced. As long as you stir the crystals every day, this stuff is great. Unfortunately it is not dust-free.

review/summary: disgusting, don't buy it
review/text: This litter is horrible! It DOES NOT lock in odors at all and in fact, my house smelled like they were going in the box without litter at all and I was cleaning it twice a day! It works okay for feces, but does nothing for urine as it does not clump and does not help smell. I figured since it was twice as expensive as the clay litter that it would work wonders, but that's not the case at all. The smell of ammonia mixed with the litter was so appalling that it felt like it was singing my nose hairs. Plus, the crystals track all over the floor which if stepped on make a bigger mess when they get crunched. The only good thing about it is that it's low on dust so that's why it gets one star. I will stick to the clay litter for half the price and the elimination of odors over this terrible product any day. Fresh step does make good clay litter though and I do like the corn one as well. But not this one...never again.

review/summary: Really good!
review/text: I bought three different varieties at the same time:<br />  Panama Bouquet Blend, Costa Rican Blend, and Guatemalan Blend<br /><br />Of the three, I liked the Panama Bouquet Blend the best overall, with the Costa Rican Blend a very close second.  The Guatemalan Blend is fantastic too, but it has a slightly heavier chocolate note and a dark acidity that I tend to shy away from (but Starbucks drinkers will like it better).<br /><br />The Panama Bouquet Blend is Sooooooo Smooooooth, it's like velvet chocolate, just so very nice.  I DREAM of waking up in the morning and having me some Panama Bouquet, with its full and rich cocoa-iness, and its smoothness.  Just very pleasant.  No acidity bite (not to my taste).  Since I don't want my coffee to slap me in the face in the morning, this is perfect.<br /><br />Better than I had hoped it would taste when I ordered it, and will definitely be in my reordering future!  I highly recommend it.

Once I moved overseas, I found I really missed cooking with it so ordered a package of Velveeta Mexican Mild from Shopping Solution.  I just received my package and am dismayed to see it is NOT Velveeta Mexican Mild but Velveeta Queso Blanco.  I will add in some chopped jalepenos as a substitute but wish the company had represented the product accurately on amazon.  (or perhaps it was just an oversight when they packaged my order)  Unfortunately, due to the great expense of re-shipping my items to an overseas location, returning this and getting what I actually ordered is not an option.

Although much of what I purchase is manufactured in China, I am wary of food products sourcing from there given the history of poor quality control and intentional tainting of protein products with lethal melamine.  I would be far more comfortable with garlic from California, so I probably will not purchase the product again even though the flavor is good.

review/summary: good food to begin your kittens life
review/text: I have been fostering kittens for a few years now and I think that this is a great food to start out on if you have a tighter budget. I really like the holistic foods, but I think that starting out with this is not too bad. It's not as great for you kitten, but it provides all their necessities and it's not too bad of a brand. All the shelters that I have been to also use this food. I just wanted to note that the higher quality food that you feed your kitten, the less waste they will produce and the general health will increase (shinier coat and etc). I always get this is the big bag because it seems to be the most worth it and this food is not too bad when you can get it on sale. You can also buy these from your local petsmarts so I think it is pretty convenient. Remember to get your pets spayed and neutered as well!! prevent the over accumulation of strays in our shelters and stop overpopulation!!!

Of all the dried types I have purchased, they like this brand and the Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula.  Each piece of food is small and bite sized for my kitten's little mouths.  Each of my kittens are less than a year old. I like how Hill's uses a portion of the price I paid for this food and donates it through their Shelter Nutrition Partnership.  I'm willing to pay a little more money for the kitten food knowing that a portion is donated to help animals have a more balanced nutrition.  I will purchase this brand again.

review/summary: My kitten loves it - and so does his "big brother"!
review/text: Several weeks ago, I adopted a new kitten, about 6 months old. I figured he would need some food of his own, so I chose Science Diet Indoor kitten food, since he will be an indoor cat. While my two cats were in the "separation" state, I fed the Science Diet to the kitten, and he ate it readily.<br /><br />Then, after I "integrated" the two cats, I had a problem; the older cat decided he liked the kitten food better than his own food. So he wouldn't eat his own food, just the kitten food. I didn't want him eating a lot of kitten food, because it is high in fat and calories, and he is already overweight. But I also wanted my kitten to get some benefit from the kitten food. I tried structured feedings, but it was no use - the older cat would rather go on a hunger strike than eat anything but the kitten food. Boy, it must taste good!<br /><br />I finally ended up mixing the adult food with the kitten food and giving it to both cats. I wish I could feed the kitten the Science Diet exclusively, but oh well, at least he is getting some of it... without my older cat getting a huge amount.

Well, she really likes dark chocolate, and had never had aerated chocolate (from what I understand, until recently, you couldn't buy it in the US very easily).  I lived in Russia for a few years and loved their chocolate (more similar to European chocolates) and developed a taste for aerated chocolate.  I was glad to find this chocolate here to order.  Price is reasonable - shipping made it so I ordered two to reduce total unit cost.  This chocolate is actually made in Russia - the wrapper is in Russian (nutritional information is given for 100 gram servings which is how they do it there) with a US tag for import reasons.  Chocolate arrived unmelted/unruined despite ridiculously hot days here in Tennessee.  Definitely worth ever penny.  Oh, and the chocolate parties?  I'm a regular now.  A vice president even came just to try this chocolate.

review/summary: Better than candy!
review/text: This stuff is the bomb!  Does list sugar as an ingredient.  As well as sulfur dioxide (preservative).  However, in a 1.5 oz serving, only 1 gram of sugar!  30 carbs and 14 grams of fiber.  Proceed w/ caution - it's addicting.  My children think it's candy.  It tastes like it.  It is mostly pretty soft & chewy w/ a very fine layer of sweet crunch on the surface.  Can be pulsed in a food processor and used instead of the syrupy, super sweet coconut flakes for baking.  Costco now sells it for $8.99/bag.  It's right next to the dried mango.  I buy several bags each trip.  Enjoy.

review/summary: My new addiction!
review/text: This stuff is awesome!!  Not only is it a healthier alternative to sweets, satisfies the sweet tooth and truly addicting, but its also a great source of dietary fiber (14g per serving).  In regard to a couple of the previous reviews, the "orange stain" on some of the pieces appears to be natural, like the pieces are from closer to the shell.  (Sort of like spots on apples, you can't expect perfection from natural foods - that's part of the beauty of it)  The nutritional label does indeed read 'sugars 1g' however the bag I have has an amended sticker on it that reads 'sugars 18g' indicating that the 1g is likely a typo.  Even with 18g of sugar, however this is a better alternative to candy and if you like coconut, its a great snack!

review/summary: Try Before You Buy - It's not For Everyone
review/text: This is one of those items you really should try before you buy - even if you love coconut.  I am a huge coconut fan and I really didn't like this stuff the first time I tried it.  While it had the coconut taste that I loved, the texture is really something you need to get used to.  Some pieces are firm and about an inch and a half in size.  Others are brittle and smaller in size (those pieces are really sweet).  All of them have an almost waxy texture.  It was kinda "meh" when I first ate it, but after a few pieces, it really grew on me.  But I really love coconut.<br /><br />It's definitely not like the yummy Philippine Mango (love at first taste super sugary goodness), but it's still a yummy snack.

review/summary: Good And Good For You. A Nice Combination.
review/text: Dried fruits and nuts constitute a fairly good portion of my diet. Thus, when I was on the latest visit to my nearby Costco Warehouse store, I spotted a display of Philippine Brand Dried Coconut. I've had the dried mangoes from this brand and they were quite good. Into the basket went an 18-ounce packet of coconut. Dried coconut is not one of my favorites, but mix it with other things and it can be quite good and good for you. For example, I read that one serving supplies 14 g of fiber, or 55 % of your daily needs. That's amazing! And with only a small amount of sodium.<br /><br />This dried coconut is a bit like eating candy, except it only has a trace of sugar and is only slightly sweet. But it chews up like a candy and is quit tasty in a very mild way. I think my young boy thinks it is candy and that's a neat trick to have around. It's good and good for you. What more could you expect from a treat?<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Bait and Switch!
review/text: AS IN PREVIOUS REVIEW, COSTCO PRICE: $8.99.<br /><br />Anyway, I loved the ORIGINAL Philippine Dried Young Coconut which used to have sulfur dioxide as the preservative.<br />The original version was heavenly. I could go through a bag of the original one in 2-3 days, it tasted that good.<br /><br />However, in the past month - end of June 2012 - they have switched to using sodium metabisulfate as the preservative, and it is completely inedible.  This new version tastes awful, horrible, rancid.  I cannot even stomach the *smell* of the new one, much less the taste.<br /><br />The old and new versions are two completely different products in my opinion!  I'd say the bottom line is don't waste your money on this one unless and until they go back to using the old formula.  (Contact them!)

review/summary: Loved it until I questioned the fat content.
review/text: I love the taste of this coconut.  I read about the fact that they sold it as having "1 gram" of sugar, then eventually corrected their labels to show 18 grams of sugar.  HUGE DIFFERENCE!  I thought it was healthy-14 grams of fiber with only 4 grams of fat.  Now I SERIOUSLY question the fat content.  If 42 grams of shredded coconut has 25 grams of fat, how can 42 grams of this coconut only have 4 grams of fat?  I saw the shredded coconut at Whole Foods and read the label.  I mean that stuff seems dry, yet they claim this product only has 4 grams?  I don't believe it. Okay, add to the fact that I've been gaining weight and wasn't sure why-this is the only thing I have changed in my diet.  BUYER BEWARE-TOO MUCH SUGAR AND I CAN'T BELIEVE ONLY 4 GRAMS OF FAT.  I'm considering having it tested, that is how pissed off I am.  I thought it was a relatively healthy evening sweet.

Soon as I tried it, I said that it was too good to be true.  And it wasn`t.  My advice to you:  get your kids to the dentist cause their teeth are gonna fall out after eating all of that sugar.  No doubt your kids are hooked and addicted to sugar now.

review/text: Fruit flavored and fruit shaped mix, in a movie concession box. You get just one 7 ounce box in this deal. Maybe this is how the wallpaper in the original "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" would have tasted, after all it is made by the Willy Wonka company. The fruit shapes are fun although they are small enough to look just like lumps for some flavors, but you can't miss the banana shaped one. The flavors taste a bit like the flavor they represnt, but are tart and tangy. Almost lke a sweet tart with a crunchy candy exterior. The flavors are banana, cherry, lime, orange, and strawberry. I agree with the other reviewer that runts can rough up your tongue and roof of mouth if you eat too many at a time.

review/summary: The Best Gluten-Free Pancake Mix!
review/text: To be honest, I've only tried one other gluten-free pancake mix besides this one (Arrowhead Mills); but now that I've found G-F Mama, I can't imagine finding a better one!  Compared with the AM (which is still good), the texture is more smooth (being that AM contains cornmeal), and it seems to be easier to flip over than AM too.  Instead of regular milk, I add Bulgarian buttermilk- which adds a special richness!  (And I sometimes add some maple flavoring, or frozen blueberries to the batter as well.)<br /><br />As a side note, I also highly recommend the Coconut Flour Blend- which is delicious!  (We've made cake, sweet bread, and even use it to coat our (fried) chicken pieces.)<br /><br />  I just recently bought the cookie, pizza, and pie crust mixes; but I haven't been able to try them out as of yet.  ..I'm happy to see that Amazon is carrying this brand!

review/text: Like a lot of other people I was looking for a "good" gluten free waffle and pancake mix; I looked at every product on the internet I think, lol. I found Mama's Pancake and Waffle mix here at Amazon and thought I'd give it a try. My whole family, and that includes extended family, loves my waffles from this mix. They don't even care about going back to the wheat flour mixes. I believe this is a case where an actual improvement has been made over the traditional style mixes. One hint that helps any recipe and that is to make sure you keep the waffles hot on the middle grill in the oven about 225 to 250 degrees--they'll stay crispy that way.

review/summary: Just one word: YUM!
review/text: When I discovered Gluten Free Mama's products, breakfast time (my favorite meal of the day) was a happy time again!  This pancake mix is absolutely delicious, easy to make, and truly the most similar to "home-made" that this scratch baker can find.  I'm NOT a mix person, and this one fact makes being celiac really tricky when it comes to baking.  But you know what?  With easy-to-make pancakes (and scones, and pizza crust, and pie crust, and flour blends) using a mix is suddenly FUN!  The healthy ingredients include almond meal, so those with nut allergies beware.  Lucky me - at least I don't have this particular issue, so I can gorge myself on the delicious pancakes to my heart's content (and trust me, I do!).  The measurements are easily modified to make more or less than the package indicates, and the mix keeps really well in the cupboard instead of having to freeze it as with other almond meal products - although honestly it doesn't last long enough for storage to be a problem.  The packaging is a neat self-sealing pouch rather than a box, so there's more room in the cupboard - so why not purchase this in bulk from Amazon so you always have some on hand like I do?!  As far as my family is concerned there's not a better gluten free company out there, and we'll remain loyal to Gluten Free Mama and her delicious, healthful products for as long as she's willing to supply them to us - which we hope is a very long time!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YR7BBI">Gluten Free Mama, Mama's Pie Crust Mix, 18-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 5)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YRBB1Y">Gluten Free Mama, Mama's Scone Mix,  32-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 5)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YRBATC">Gluten Free Mama, Mama's Almond Blend Flour, All Purpose Flour, 4-Pound Pouches (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YR7BEK">Gluten Free Mama, Mama's Pizza Crust Mix, 18.1-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 5)</a>

The texture is the closest to normal of any gluten free product that my family has had.  My husband can't stand gluten free baked goods and even he enjoys everything that I make from Gluten Free Mama!  Most gluten free baked goods are very grainy but I haven't had that complaint with Gluten Free Mama products.  The pancake mix is probably one of the best pancake mixes I have ever had gluten free or not!  The Almond Flour is great, makes great muffins, and the Coconut Flour is also amazing.  All of the products have great flavor and texture, and if you have ever tried eating gluten free you know how important texture is.  You can also make really good biscuits from the pancake mix as well!

Not sure what it is but once I put butter on them it almost has a corn/popcorn taste to them which is just odd.  Even my pancake loving son doesn't like these.  Mind you he will eat them but he doesn't ask for seconds like he does with another mix or even buckwheat pancakes.<br /><br />However I gave this mix 3 stars because it makes terrific pancakes on a stick (when maple extract is put in the batter and then baked around sausages).  Everyone in my family wanted more when I made that meal.  So I will keep this mix in the house to make that dish but I think that's the only use I have come up with so far.

review/text: This sauce is salty.  Before you use the sauce, you need to TRY IT YOURSELF.  Then when you use it, you are only suppose to use it in SMALL quantities as in SMALL spoonfuls.  Add a little bit first, taste the dish and then add more.  This isn't a type of sauce that you can just slather on to something.  When you stir fry with it, lets say, black bean chicken, add a little bit, taste and then add more.<br /><br />DO NOT ADD ANY ADDITIONAL SOY SAUCE to your dish.  Black bean sauce is pretty much black beans, salt, soy sauce and oyster sauce.  You do not need to add any additional salt or soy sauce.<br /><br />I bought this sauce because if I'm short on time and I don't have time to soak black beans, this is a good substitute.<br /><br />Just a warning, sampling the sauce itself is essential, but it is so salty that it may make you gag.  However, it is delicious when used in CORRECT quanitities and spread over meat.<br /><br />Let me remphasize, SMALL QUANTITIES.

For a large stir fry dish, add 1-2 or max max max 3 teas of Black Bean Garlic Sauce and equal amt Red Chili Garlic Paste same brand is a good one) to the oil and mix well. Of course you can squeeze in lemon or lime juice or and equal or lesser amt of Tamarind paste (cheap 6 pk on Amazon so go in on it w some friends because Tamarind paste is super concentrated and similar to lemon juice but more savory, and it is NOT a dipping sauce either) and also add more garlic and or mix in some quality peanut butter (not Skippy or other pasty kind) or sesame tahini (Joyva Tahini is my fav and cheapest at Vitacost), then add your various vegetables and meat if you want. I would NEVER consider this a dipping sauce and if adding to a broth...i would only add a speck. This keeps FOREVER refridgerated (also refridg nut butters). Always use a clean utensil to scoop out of container for longevity of freshness. :-)

Even then, you could taste the saltiness.<br /><br />Thinking it was my fault for even adding any type of soy sauce to it, I bought a new jar and tried it alone in the dish. Once more, the saltiness was so overpowering, one couldn't even eat anything without having to rinse the dish off.<br /><br />The tastiness of the black beans and garlic is there, but the saltiness is way too overpowering and is too much to take in.

review/text: We are diehard stirfry fans and enjoy all types of cultural foods. If it's different and has lots of veggies and a bit of good meat or seafood, we love it. This sauce is the exception. We could hardly eat a few bites. What a waste of a bunch of wonderful ingredients like scallops and fresh vegetables. The sauce is incredibly bitter and salty.

review/summary: Delicious, but....................
review/text: This honey will not be for everyone. If you are usually an American honey eater this honey is akin to a forest honey or a dark autumn honey. It has a very strong and lingering flavour which is both spicy and fragrant and is absolutely delicious!

review/summary: Best honey on the planet
review/text: This is hands down the best honey I have ever put in my mouth. In fact, it's so good that I give it annually for Christmas gifts. Watch out, though - this will spoil you for that stuff sold in the bear-shaped bottles! There is simply no comparison between this and the product carried in grocery stores. Because it's expensive, I don't cook with it. But I love it on toast or muffins, in tea, or anywhere that the honey flavor really comes through.

review/summary: Awesome and Delicious!
review/text: This is a thick, creamy and exotically flavorful honey, but it is not inexpensive.  I love Tasmanian Leatherwood Honey, but purchase it only as a special treat, for the cost otherwise is prohibitive.  I recommend it because it's the most delicious honey I've ever tasted, as well as being antibacterial and calming to the digestive system.<br /><br />Once washed, the attractive containter can be used for other purposes.

review/summary: An exotic experience
review/text: I just received this honey as a gift, and it is a delight.  The mostly unfiltered honey has a very complex flavor and changes and develops as you taste it.  It starts with a strong, almost molasses flavor and then the floral tones arrive.  There is a perfume-ish quality, and the finish is a long floral aftertaste that draws me back for more.  Very exotic, very good.

review/text: 10 stars. This stuff is addicting. It's like liquid flowers. So sweet and floral. Great gift too. Gave my dad some for Christmas.  Too expensive to cook with but really great in tea and peanut butter sandwiches.

review/summary: Excellent honey
review/text: Another of my favorite honeys.  This is from New Zealand, also made from the leatherwood flower.  It's a little thicker than the one from Australia, but not quite as sweet.  Delicious over Greek yogurt.

review/summary: It's good.
review/text: I will add another five star review to this delectable honey. Whoever that bird is on the label should be given a Nobel prize for making this stuff. Of all nature's treats that weird bird's honey is her finest. It's like a Unicorn actually farted rainbows directly into my mouth.<br /><br />Try it in tea.<br /><br />Edit 5/10/12: I hope you stocked up because the price of this honey just doubled. Hopefully it goes back down to ~$12 or so soon.

review/summary: Heavenly Aroma
review/text: I became familiar with Tansmanian Leatherwood honey when a local delicatessen (since defunct) offered it.  It has an aromatic quality that is indescribable. Comes in a colorful container, too.  Try it!!!  (The price is a bit higher than what I paid at the delicatessen.)
