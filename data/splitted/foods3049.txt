We have used quite a few of Chef Paul Prudhomme's seasonings and have never been disappointed.

When I'm out, I've even tried mixing a bag of sugar and my guesses as to what else went in there. Not as good =( Don't stop making this Mr. Prudhomme, I'm warning you.<br /><br />Try chopping up a mango, half a peach, a tiny bit of bell pepper, throw in some cilantro, juice a lemon on top, drizzle some honey, dash of salt, and let marinade while your salmon is in the oven. Serve salsa on top, perfect mix of sweet and sour.

review/summary: Not my cup of tea
review/text: I tried to find out the ingredient list before I purchased this seasoning. I went to Paul's website and it didn't list the ingredients. It said this: Salmon Magic(tm), Chef Paul's newest creation, is a unique blend of carefully selected herbs and spices with subtle accents of dry mustard seeds.<br /> After I received it the first ingredient listed was Sugar. My problem is that I don't like sweet tasting food unless it's a dessert. I tried to like it but I could hardly get through dinner. If you like your food on the slightly sweet side it will probably be fine for you.<br /><br />P.S. I really like his Seafood and Blackened Redfish Magic.

review/text: Seriously , these peppers add great heat and smokiness to any dish. Just puree or chop em with a food blender or knife. I use them in a simple sour cream sauce -mix in pepper purre, touch of cumin and a squirt of lime juice to taste. Use as a dip or on chicken etc. I use the puree for burgers too. Mix in one whole 12 oz can of the chipotle peppers (pureed) into 2 lbs of ground beef - add garlic and onion powder as well. Grill to your liking and top with cheddar and onion (cilantro is a good addition too!). I always get compliments on these smoky hot burgers. Good Luck.

review/summary: My opinion
review/text: This is just my opinion based on trying a few other organic sugars. C&H does not harden as easily as other os's. It is a MUCH more pleasant tasting sugar and seems to blend more easily when used in my morning bowl of cold cereal.  I like it. I have to buy it on Amazon now because the Kroger store that once carried it has limited it's sugar to Domino's only and a store brand of organic sugar that was just downright nasty. I also use ONLY C&H pure cane sugar non-organic; brown & white for baking and flavoring. The quality of C&H has never disappointed and it is a company I trust. And, though I don't know for certain; I believe it is grown and processed in the good old U.S of A. - Hawaii - or so their jingle once claimed. Aw shoot now I cannot get the song out of my head!

review/text: I use Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning Blends ~ Poultry Magic for all my poultry and stuffing needs. The problem is the only store that sold it (Superfresh) in my area just closed down. It adds that kick that my family and myself likes. I normally buy it in a 2.0 oz. jar for about $3 plus. So there is no doubt the 24 oz. can was a better value. It shipped fast (3 days) and came with a little catalog with all their other spices, most of which I didn't know existed.

review/text: This bar really did for me what it claimed it would... I ate it on the run and when I got home a couple of hours later, when I would normally raid the kitchen cabinet, ravenous, I found I wasn't hungry or grouchy at all. In fact, I paced around the house because I wasn't sure what to do --getting home starving had become such a habit!<br />I am not diabetic; I bought this bar because it said it was gluten free and also because I have trouble staying full. I was a little nervous about the "made in a facility which processes wheat" warning but after I ate it I did some research on the company website and they actually test the products for gluten.<br />Now, the flavor of this particular one is a tad off and soy-y, but not bad at all. I plan to try the peanut one; I heard it's good. Try the chips the company makes as well. The white cheddar ones are super yummy.

review/summary: Does not live up to it's ad
review/text: As a diabetic, i am always looking for anything that can help my blood sugars. I was excited to read about these bars, and the claims sounded great. For me,  this product did not live up to it's claims.  The taste was terrible!  I ate it anyway, thinking the benefit would outweigh the taste, but within an hour or 2 ,I was very hungry!  Very disappointed in product. I would spend my money on something else.

review/summary: Only Trail Mix I've Ever Hated
review/text: I've tried lots of different trail mixes from sweet to salty to hot and spicy and lots of different brands as well and this is the first trail mix I've ever had that I literally just couldn't eat because not only does it taste horrible to me but it smells icky too.<br /><br />I'm not sure exactly what it is. If you've ever eaten raw nuts and substandard chocolate together then that's a bit what it reminds me of. Roasted nuts taste a lot different than raw and I'm not saying the nuts in this package are raw but it's got that....super organic kind of taste that's sort of bitter and just not good.<br /><br />Another strike against it is that it was the most expensive bag of trail mix in my local grocery store. Normally if I get something at the grocery store that doesn't taste good to me, I just "lump it" because I don't think it's the store's fault but in this case, I took it back and received a refund because even the store manager thought it smelled funny and he wouldn't even taste it. Please note that it was not expired product.<br /><br />I'm going back to my regular brand. I can't recall the name of it but I know it when I see it. If I can recall it, I'll come back and add it to this review because it's FAB and the cost is reasonable.<br /><br />Addendum 10/21/12: My favorite brand of trail mix is Kar's. I can get a huge 34 ounce bag of it at my local grocery store for about 8 bucks. I add unsalted almonds and unsalted pecans to it to make it just perfect. You might like it as is but I'm a type 2 diabetic so I like to watch my carbs/sugar and salt intake.

review/summary: Not Recommended At All
review/text: I didn't think you could really go wrong with any type of trail mix, but the "Fancy" Mojo Mix proved me wrong. At first, the taste just seemed off to me. Finally, I just got bugged at how not good it was, so I decided, "I just want the delicious chocolate candies since the rest of it is no good". That's when I realized that the chocolate is the worst part! I ended up throwing away the vast majority of a 28 oz bag I had purchased for a road trip. Save yourself the disappointment and don't buy EnergyClub Fancy Mojo Mix.

review/text: I have a Pit Bull who is a little over a year old.  To say he is food motivated is an understatement.  However, with that being said he is still picky.  He adores these treats and others from Darford.  I do much research before I feed treats/food to my dog and I could not find any bad information on this company.  I promote these treats to family/friends that have dogs and their dogs are also hooked.  Good wholesome treats and grainfree which is good because some dogs have allergy problems with grains.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: This gum is pretty decent. It loses its flavor after only a few minutes of chewing, but I don't chew it for the taste. It tastes good, but there are other benefits to chewing this gum and those are more important to me. I generally pop 2 pieces in my mouth after each time I eat and chew for anywhere between 15-45 minutes.<br /><br />I think it does an excellent job of removing the food from my teeth, especially the deep pits of the molars. It helps to reduce cavities by not allowing the bacteria to munch on the leftover food in your mouth.<br /><br />I generally have a nice clean feeling in my mouth after chewing. This gum does not replace flossing - I recommend that people still floss, but the dental benefits of this gum are fantastic.<br /><br />Best of all it's sweetened with xylitol which won't cause your bloodsugar to spike and it does not contribute to cavities because of the structure of the xylitol molecules.

review/summary: Healthy, Natural Chewing Gum
review/text: I grew up loving gum. Bubblegum, chewing gum, whatever. I'd chew the stuff until my jaw hurt. Now, thanks to scientific progress and a small dose of common sense, I've learned that sugar, aspartame, and basically every other sugar substitute out there has detrimental effects to your teeth/brain/blood sugar/etc. But I still wanted gum. Enter Spry *cue infomercial music*. I bought a jar of this back in June and am just getting down to the bottom of it (I tend to chew 2-3 pieces at a time). The xylitol is healthy, the gum is consistent, the flavor is real (even though it doesn't last very long). It does a fine job of freshening up my mouth, and it's hard not to grow weary of all the clueless folks who bash this because it's so foreign to the aspartame-pumped stuff they're used to chewing. Give me natural sugar alcohol any day. I'm forgetful enough without Alzheimer's.

review/summary: No chemical poison sweetner in them
review/text: Theis gum is great. I used to chew a lot of the Dentyne and other brands the use aspartame and used to use aspartame and splenda with my coffee and oatmeal until I developed insomnia and a heightened sense of fear and anxiety. I thought I was going crazy.<br /><br />It took me a while to figure out what was causing it. One week after I stopped using chemical sweeteners and drank a lot of water to flush my system, I was back to normal. I could get a good night sleep, wake up refreshed. Upon further research I found how damaging aspartame an splenda is to our bodies, yet we continue to see them in diet soda and other products. As a result I've grown so sensitive to that stuff that even one piece of a chewing gum containing aspartame or two sips of a drink containing splenda makes me suffer the prior side effects.<br /><br />Anyway, I love chewing gum and these are great and don't bother me at all. Cheers and stay healthy.<br /><br />Public service: If you or someone you know have developed insomnia or other psychological problems and not know what's causing it while drinking diet soda or taking Asp/Splenda in coffee, those are the culprits.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I'm trying to avoid aspartame, which is in EVERYTHING sugar free, it seems. This is the best tasting aspartame-free gum I have been able to find. Also, I'm starting to enjoy buying gum in a 600-pack! :)<br /><br />The flavor doesn't last long. It seems the gum-makers use aspartame to make gum flavor last a long time, so when you give up aspartame, you are effectively giving up long-lasting gum flavor. Therefore, I don't hold the brevity of the flavor against the makers of Spry. I get about five minutes of flavor before it's time to spit it out.<br /><br />Hint: empty Altoids tins (or similar) work really well for carrying some Spry gum with you!

review/summary: Chew it for healthy teeth - Xylitol helps reduce cavities
review/text: True, the flavor isn't long lasting but a very important aspect of this gum often goes unsaid.  Xylitol has been proven in studies to reduce cavities. This is the gum to let your kids chew.  Although, they say you need to chew it at least 4 times a day to get the full benefit.<br /><br />This gun also has no artificial colors, ingredients or sweeteners and a very low glycemic index.<br /><br />We also use the Xylitol nose spray and the never-ending sniffing finally ended.<br /><br />There are articles and books written about the positive health benefits of Xylitol.

review/text: I LOVE this gum.  I prefer sugar-free gum and am not able to eat aspartame.  That leaves me with few choices.  I tried this gum several months back.  Now I have to order it by the largest container available because I chew it all the time.  The flavor is great.  No weird aftertaste from the xylitol.  The flavor lasts a long time as does the texture which is often a serious problem for sugar-free gum.  They make smaller packages if you are just trying for the first time, but you will wish you had bought the larger size as you will be addicted like I am.

review/summary: wonderful alternative to chewing gum
review/text: I chewed gum with nutrasweet for years and thought I couldn't walk as fast or remember things because of the natural progression of age. As a nurse and a person who reads a lot about nutrition and health I know that people have been misdiagnosed with MS when they consumed products with nutrasweet (aspartame). When I took nutrasweet out of my diet I could walk fast again and think clearer, I was surprised. Spry lets me chew gum again, it protects my teeth from decay and my mouth from bacteria. I don't ever want to be without it again and with the subscribe and save feature, I don't even have to remember to order it.

review/summary: Don't buy this just because it's cheaper!
review/text: If you are buying this gum because of the different sweetener, that's fine.  But if you are buying it because it's cheaper per piece than other similar gums, DON'T!  The pieces are a little smaller and I found that two pieces was a closer match to ONE of the other stuff.  Also, the flavor just doesn't last.  You remember that pink Bazooka gum that had a little cartoon in it that you used to get at halloween time?  This gum flavor lasts about as long as that did (so... way short!  Really, don't bother if you're trying to save a buck, otherwise (you people who worry about different kinds of fake sugar) the flavor is good, while it lasts.  Maybe I'll feed it to my kids (keep them out of my better gum).

review/text: I heard about this gum on a radio program--with a respected physician encouraging his listeners to use Spry gum.  I ordered the 600-piece jar, and it was fairly pricey.  However, I found that you needed two or three pieces for a good "chew," and the flavor  lasted only 2-3 minutes. My husband didn't like the gum at all. I threw away 3/4 of the jar after owning it for a few weeks.  Certainly not worth the price.

review/text: Just bought a case of Nestle Pure Life water.  We were with my boyfriend's daughter and she told us to buy a different kind since they sold it at school and she thought it tasted "funny."  Since she tends to be a little finicky, we disregarded her comment.  Mistake.  The water has an odd, metallic aftertaste and your tongue feels a little tingly afterward (not in a good way).  Even on sale, this is definitely not worth it.  We not only wouldn't buy it again, we wouldn't even take it if it was free.  It's that bad.

I like Ozarka natural spring water but can't stand Nestle Pure Life.  He showed me that Ozarka is a division of Nestle and it was all in my head, that the bottles are identical but just have different labels.  Looking closer at the labels, I see what the difference is.  The Nestle Pure Life is basically distilled water with added minerals.  So I wouldn't buy it unless you don't mind the taste of distilled water.

review/summary: Ambrosial treat appeases finnicky adults and children alike
review/text: I've never had much of a sweet tooth and even I find these lollipops to be addictive.  They are not sickeningly or artificially sweet, there are no awful additives and food colourings, just fruit juice and sugar.  Best of all, it's organic.<br /><br />There is a wide variety of piquant flavours, some more traditional (Strawberry Smash) and others more tropical (Mango Tango).  NB: I have to agree with a previous reviewer in that the bags definitely do not provide equal amounts of each flavour.  Luckily, none of them taste terrible but it is a legitimate niggle.<br /><br />For the kids, this candy is especially practical due to its relatively small (read as exercise in moderation) size and you can give them a few without feeling like you're spoiling or depriving them.  As for the adults, the flavours are complex enough to keep you interested in a guilt-free indulgence.  Sure they cost a bit more than non-organic lollies but where else are you going to find gluten-free Kosher lollipops that taste this great?  Exactly.<br /><br />So whether you're bribing your nieces and nephews into behaving or helping former smoker friends ease the pain of nicotine withdrawal, it's always good to have a bag of these on hand.

review/text: Most amazing candy I have ever had... I have my whole office hooked on these Lollipops and now I have more visitors to my desk than ever before.<br /><br />For someone like me who has chemical sensitivity, irritable bowel & gastroparesis.... these Lollipops have been a wonderful treat that do not exacerbate any of my medical conditions. :)

review/summary: Good assortment but does not contain every flavor
review/text: This version of the lollipop assortment has a good variety of flavors but there are a few that are not included such as the lemon, orange, and ginger. However, if you dont want to have to buy the full 5lb bag, this is still an acceptable assortment with a good variety.<br /><br />As for the lollypops themselves, theres no point in trying to give the flavors a rating since one reviewer says they hate it and the next says they love it. One thing though, is that some of the colors are very similar to each other and it can be hard to differentiate between the lollypops at a glance, and its harder to remember the exact flavors you enjoy. The blueberry one to me doesnt taste anything like blueberries, and its not blue either, its white, and is my least favorite. My most favorite is the wet face watermelon and mango tango. I purchased my bag at whole foods and got a fairly even assortment of flavors.<br /><br />The lollypops are all wrapped individually. They last a decent amount of time in your mouth and the flavor lasts the whole time. They are roughly the size of a quarter, but thicker. I wouldnt give these to little kids since of course, they could choke, but also since you can bite it near the end and get even smaller hard pieces of lollypop. Also, the stick lasts longer then other brands unlike dum-dums which tend to fall apart and leave you with pieces of paper in your mouth.<br /><br />22 calories per lollypop, 3 lollypops per serving, 17g carbs and 17g sugar per serving. Made in mexico, certified organic.<br /><br />To say that these are the BEST lollypop I ever tasted is a little overrated.. these are certainly tasty and fulfilling, but in the end its still basically sugar on a stick. Some people leaving reviews are touting it as a healthy miracle just because it doesnt contain a fraction of a percent of artificial coloring. But its a good product to snack on when you need something sweet. If you really love a particular flavor they do sell bags individually of the various flavors as well.

review/text: These are very yummy lollipops. The flavors are intense, they are low-calorie (you can eat 3 for 70 calories), they are fairly good sized, and they are free of yucky chemicals. My kids love them! They are also a great value- the bags are huge!<br />mango, lemon, and watermelon are my favorites- very fruity. Pomegranite one has an intense cherry flavor- I don't really like cherry, but the kids seem to like them. No orange one to speak of in my bags- too bad, since we love oranges....

review/text: I had morning sickness so bad it lasted all day and for 5.5 months, ugh!  I called it baby flu since there was little relief.  Ginger ale and YummyEarth organic candies were the only two things that settled my stomach enough to eat a small meal.  The assorted bag was nice to switch it up depending on my taste that day.  After I delivered my baby girl, I still enjoyed these when I have a dry mouth or would like a little sweetness.  It was so nice to find a tasty organic hard candy, so much tastier than Preggo Pops!

review/summary: Classic flavor and nutritious.
review/text: Red Zinger is the tea that made Celestial Seasonings famous.  This was the must-have tea in the seventies.  Every well stocked hippie cupboard had to have this tea next to the brown rice and soy sauce.  But it is the healthful ingredients and classic flavor that keep it an enduring favorite.  This caffeine-free herbal blend brews up into a tasty ruby potion that smells lemon-mint tart and tastes like minty cherry syrup.<br /><br />Hibiscus is the first ingredient.  First consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Hibiscus tea has diuretic qualities, can lower blood pressure, and has minerals and flavonoids.  The second ingredient, rose hips, are very high in vitamin C and are used in herbal medicine to prevent urinary tract infections.  Other ingredients include peppermint, lemon grass, orange peel, lemon myrtle, licorice and wild cherry bark.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Passion colors all that it touches in its own hues."  Baltasar Gracian.

review/summary: What an awesome first christmas present for my girlfriend! LOL.
review/text: Last year, I didn't quite know what to get my gf for Christmas until we were out shopping at the local grocery and noticed that they no longer carried OEP Cheesy Mexican Rice.  She looked at me with actual sadness in her eyes, as we'd eaten it at least once or twice per month for our entire relationship.  We checked everywhere for availability... Target?  Out.  Walmart? Out.  Harris Teeter & Food Lion?  Out and Out.  So, I went on Amazon looking for a gift she'd never forget... and here it was.  The laugh we shared on Christmas was worth the price, which is still a great deal nonetheless.<br /><br />Of course, I got her other stuff too... but nothing quite made an impression like a case of Cheesy Mexican Rice.  We had to order another case in July!

review/text: I'm one of those weird people who has never been able to drink water.  I don't like the taste of it, it makes me gag when it's going down, and it just stresses me out even thinking of drinking water.  I know, I know, I have issues... Anyway, I'm getting OLDER and realizing that drinking 5 bottles of flavored sugary Snapple is not going to cut it for my daily liquid intake any more.  Then our cafeteria at work started stocking this stuff and I thought I'd give it a try.  I was IMMEDIATELY hooked.  It's just damn good.  It's not sickly sweet or overpowering with fake fruity flavor like some of the other flavored waters.  It's just the right HINT of flavor.  I'm addicted.  Now I get regular deliveries to make sure I don't run out.

review/summary: I am in love.
review/text: I love this water so much, I just subscribed to get it once a month. I'm sort of amused/bewildered at some of the other reviewers claims that the fruit flavor in this water is too mild- the flavor of the blackberry, in particular, is a somewhat strong, almost jam-like taste. It's not overpowering, but I don't think it could be any stronger without negatively affecting the flavor of the water. My guess is that what most reviewers are actually missing in this water is the sweetener- there is NOT even a hint of that- just the taste of fruit and water. This is precisely what I've been looking for FOREVER in a flavored water, as I don't like artificial sweetener but I do sometimes prefer something beyond the plain taste of water.<br />My only possible complaint with this product is that it's ridiculously overpriced. But apparently not so much that I'm not willing to pay it. It's THAT good.

But you get what you pay for - the less that goes into something, the more we pay - sad but true - you want something natural and healthy - it costs.

review/summary: Pure undiluted blackberry essence - like spa water - love it!
review/text: If you love berries in the raw, particularly blackberries, you will love Hint Premium Essence Water in Blackberry.  I tried this for the first time at Starbucks and am totally hooked and am looking forward to trying their other flavors. As someone who's constantly looking for healthy beverage alternatives and gets tired of drinking plain filtered water, Hint has done it right and created a zero-calorie, zero-sweetener, preservative-free, refreshing water with literally a "hint" of natural fruit essence - no man-made fruit sweeteners here!  The only thing I'm not crazy about is the price @ $2 per 16 oz. bottle when purchased directly from the [...] website.  The 10% savings when buying from Amazon does help ease the high-price factor, but not by much....so I still consider this product somewhat of a splurge/luxury for this budget-conscious/health-conscious consumer.  With that said, I plan to buy in bulk every couple of months any how and am looking forward to drinking these in the summer in "slushie" form after storing them in the freezer for a bit.  Happy "Hint" Drinking!

review/summary: Yum!  Tasty treat
review/text: I tried Hint for the first time yesterday and I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised!  I have quite a sweet tooth, but I am trying to decrease my intake of sugary juices and cut back on the amount of soda that I drink.  I avoid drinks with fake sweetners like the plague because I don't like the taste, but I was very interested to find out that Hint has does not contain sugar or any sweetners at all.  It is literally a bottle of water with *just a hint* of fruit flavor.  The flavor is not overpowering, and it makes water a bit more exciting.<br /><br />I am not one to drink water with meals.  I drink plenty of bottled water when I am thirsty or after meals, but I usually grab soda or juice when I eat lunch/dinner.  However, I do enjoy drinking Hint with my lunch.  I think it is a great alternative to many of the super sugary drinks and diet beverages on the market.<br /><br />I recommend that you try it!  It is a bit pricey, but it is a nice healthy treat.  I agree with a previous reviewer:  the flavor is similar to eating a piece of fruit and then washing it down with a sip of water.  That is exactly what it tastes like.

review/text: I was skeptical when I first tried this, because most flavored waters are way too sugary sweet for my tastes.  But this product delivers what it promises, a lightly flavored, cool, refreshing drink with yes, just a Hint of blackberry.  You end up feeling like you just ate a handful of berries and then washed it down with some springwater, with just that essence of berry left in your mouth.<br /><br />I wish they would come up with more traditional flavors instead of some of the bizarre combinations they have.  What about just plain old lemon?  Or Strawberry?  And I wish it was available in more stores instead of just Starbucks and Whole Foods.

review/summary: Tried it at Starbucks today after Pilates: Huh, kinda not working for me
review/text: I do think this product is crazy overpriced for what it is and how much flavor you get. However, I was thirsty after Pilates and went to the Starbucks next to the studio and they had this, so, liking blackberries and having tasted the Pear Hint (which has a complex and interestingly subtle flavor), I got it.<br /><br />Not interesting. Not complex. Very much like you just added water to a glass in which you'd had some berry juice. But the flavor itself, while clearly a berry flavor, is not rereshing or interesting. It fell flat for me.<br /><br />I did like the idea that Hint gave me to make my own fruit essence water. A simple idea, but other than a squeeze of lime or lemon or other citrus at home, it had never occurred to me to just add a couple drops of fruit concentrate to my filtered water at home and chill.<br /><br />I'll do that now. I think it's crazy to pay a premium price for barely flavored water (unless you're away from home and dying of thirst and looking for something that's not sugary like juice or boring like plain water).<br /><br />Nice enough, but really, nothing special. Though I love their bottle /label designs. They do catch the eye and feel "clean".

review/summary: SIMPLY THE BEST!
review/text: I was looking for a zero or low calorie drink that didn't contain a lot of unnatural ingredients that could take the place of Diet Pepsi which I love but is not good for me since I have acid reflux.  Plus I had read where the artificial coloring to create the caramel color is not good.  Vitamin water didn't appeal to me because I thought how much of this stuff can I really drink?  I don't want to overdose on too much vitamins.  When I found Hint water it seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. The first bottle I tried I was a little disappointed.  You can smell the "flavor" more than taste it .. it really is just a "hint" of flavor.  However, the more I drank it the more I started to love this product and now this is my choice of drink!  I don't write reviews.  This is only the second review of written out of all the many products I've purchased from Amazon.  Give this product a chance.  Like I said, it was instant like for me but by the second or third bottle I discovered that this is really a great product and excellent way to drink more water.

review/summary: So delicious -- satisfies juice craving, but a bit acidic
review/text: I really love these -- they're incredibly refreshing!  I drink one whenever I'm craving juice, and it really satisfies the craving.  I'm pretty sensitive to sugar, so bottled juice is off the menu.  My favorite flavor is blackberry, which tastes just like blackberry without the tartness (it's awesome). The only minor drawback would be that I can't overindulge in these bc they are slightly acidic, though I'm pretty sensitive, so not sure if others have had issues with this.  I've tried drinking this in place of my daily water intake, and I ended up having heartburn-ish sensations, so I drink these as a treat rather than a substitute for water.  Overall love these, and I don't miss bottled juice at all.

review/summary: Bad experiance
review/text: The picture looks like a nice bonsai tree.<br /><br />The product is a branch cut to about 4 inches in length and a clump of brown dead needles to it and spray painted.  The pieces are glued together with a big clump of white glue that runs all over the branch.  Whoever glued it together obviously felt more was better. because it's all over the place,<br /><br />this is not a preserved tree.<br /><br />It looks more like a second grade class project where the students took branches and glued them together and then spray painted the top green.<br />Wait, I'm sorry.  That is exactly what it is.<br /><br />I bought this for my wife for her birthday.<br />It's now hidden in the basement so I can ship it back.<br /><br />If they don't take returns I will throw it out.<br />It's that hideous
