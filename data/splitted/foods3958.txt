review/summary: TWO big candy bars in EACH Package!
review/text: !!HEY, these are BIG! There are actually two candy bars in each of these wraps, (36 servings) so two people can enjoy Baby Ruth, or eat one for now, save one for later! Each bar is 250 calories, has 2 grams of protein and 16 carbs. NO trans fat and no cholesterol, either!  My sister and I love these King Size Baby Ruth bars because each of us gets a BIG bar and is not tempted to consume BOTH! (You know, once the wrapper is ripped open and the other candy bar is just sitting there!) Great idea Nestle had! This is an excellent afternoon pick me up snack!

review/text: This was a great deal on this king sized box of Baby Ruth bars.  The only problem is that they are harder than a rock when you bite into them.  Made my jaw ache just eating one.  I normally like Baby Ruth bars, but I think these were on a bit of the old side.

You'll only get a refund on the purchase price and not on shipping, which is most of the cost of the product. I've ordered large and small plastic bottles from a different Vender (British Delights) without any shipping casualties. The cans that did make it taste just fine (mmmm good!)

review/text: I bought a case of this breading cuz a Facebook friend raved about it and where I live I couldnt find in my local supermarkets so I had to buy a case online. The breading has a good taste to it but I thought it would have more kick to it, I first tried it frying sum chicken,it was cool but no kick,then I read it would hav more kick if I cook the chicken in the oven,still no kick. I jus add sum Cayenne pepper to the breading and BAM,I got my kick! Im not a big fan of supa spicy foods but I do like sum kick to my chicken from time to time.

review/summary: Another Good Choice in Organic Cookies
review/text: After my positive experience with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUT89A">Health Valley Cookie Cremes, Double Chocolate</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027CE2S">Newman's Own Organics Newman-O'S Ginger-O's, 16-Ounce Packages</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027CE2I">Newman's Own Organics Alphabet Cookies, Cinnamon, 10-Ounce Bags</a>, I thought I would give Country Choice a go.  So far, I'm "4-for-4" in ordering good organic cookies.  I took a chance and bought them without trying them first.  I'm happy to say I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Country Choice Organic Ginger Lemon is a good tasting cookie that have all the benefits of sweetness we would expect from cookies, but lacking the artificial ingredients consistent with cookies commonly on the market.  The cookies are lighter than other organic cookies I've tried, but the taste is quite strong and the cookies are sweet, a surprise from my initial introduction to organic cookies that had the flavor and consistency of the cardboard box they were stored in.<br /><br />There are some points the consumer needs to know; they may be minuses for some, but they're certainly pluses for me:<br /><br />1) The cookies are VERY sweet; I had to have a glass of milk with them.  While I adore sweet cookies, it may turn some people off.  Be mindful of that.<br /><br />2) The taste of ginger is overwhelmed by the strongest taste of lemon in cookies I've ever had.  To me this would be a significant minus, except that I absolutely love the lemony taste in cookies.  The aroma is heavenly, but the taste is so powerful it seems almost artificial.  Oddly, I can taste a hint of ginger when they're dunked in milk (any explanation from food chemists/scientists out there?).  Again I love that taste, but others may not.  If you want the gingery taste, you would have to be an expert food taster to find it here (in my opinion).<br /><br />3) While these cookies are made with organic and natural ingredients (no hydrogenated oils or trans fats), they're still cookies: they are loaded with sugar, sodium and carbs.  Two cookies pack a whopping 130 calories; 50 calories from fat.  Remember, organic does not always mean healthy.  And because these cookies are lighter than other organic cookies I've tried, and very tasty, it is very easy to overeat them.<br /><br />4) These cookies (barely) pass my all-important "dunkability" test, where they adequately absorb milk to compliment the flavor of the cookies (Oreo's, despite their artificial ingredients, is still king in the dunkability of cookies, in my honest opinion).  They taste delicious when dunked, but these cookies begin to fall apart quickly, so holding them under milk for a length of time could be problematic.<br /><br />Given the minuses I've indicated, you wonder: why do I give it four stars.  Simple: I love them.  Taste, like beauty, is in the eye (or palate) of the beholder.  And I can't get enough of them.  While my opinion is unquestionably biased, I try to give as much unbiased information on the product as I can.  Use it to make your decision.<br /><br />As with all Amazon grocery products, I recommend going to a supermarket or specialty store (Whole Foods, for example), buy a single pack and sample the cookies before you buy the entire case.  I took a gamble and bought the case untested; it's a gamble that has paid dividends for me.

review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Vanilla creme filling between two vanilla wafers. The vanilla wafers are very light and crispy which goes well with the smooth vanilla creme. Vanilla bliss. More crumbly than the chocolate wafers. Kosher D from processing on shared equipment. 65 kcal per cookie. I put 2-4 cookies in zipper snack bags to make convenient portions. I save and reuse these snack bags for when I open the next "big" package. Easy to keep these fresh in an airtight cookie jar or gallon (4 ltr) ziplock bag.

The nutrition facts and ingredient list are the icing on the cake - so much better for you than Oreos and just as good (if not better) tasting. They may be more expensive than Oreos but it is well worth it. Highly recommended.

review/text: Country Choice Organic Ginger Lemon cookies are the tastiest sandwich cookies on the market.  They have a tangy, fresh flavor that tickles the tongue and sets them apart from other, more mundane cookies.  I only wish that they were more widely available locally.  My whole family goes through six packages in about a week.  If you want to stock your larder with an adventurous snack, you can't miss with these delicious sandwich cookies.

review/summary: Super great - way better than Oreos
review/text: These chocolate cookies are an organic version of Oreo-type cookies but are far superior than that name brand, in my opinion.  They are seriously addicting and I cannot buy them anymore because I tend to eat toooooooo many and the package is gone in a couple/few days.  They are not particularly healthy - they are a cookie, after all!  The cookie part is nice and crunchy (almost tending toward light and crisp) with an excellent chocolate flavor.  The filling is great - smooth and creamy (does not get hard like some other oreo-types) with a good degree of sweetness.  I have also tried the Paul Newman brand of oreos and was not that impressed.  The Country Choice far exceeds all other brands - highly recommend!

review/summary: Best cookies I've ever had!!
review/text: These are the best cookies I've ever had.  I was never a fan of oreo-type cookies until I tasted these!!  With a really nice cookie outside and a mint creme that is delicious (they're not too minty but just right), you will LOVE these cookies!!  I am now a fan - and the fact that they're organic is an added bonus.

review/text: These are my favorite chocolate sandwich cookie.  The chocolate is more semisweet than the other famous brand & these are also not so sugary sweet.  They are not health food (darn) but are a tasty treat in moderation.

review/summary: Crunchy & minty
review/text: UPS just delivered them so of course I had to try them before lunch. The chocolate wafer is nice and crisp and the mint creme center has a moderate mint flavor. If you take the wafer apart like one would do for an Oreo, the center is a bit gritty like the sugar wasn't fully blended. However I still prefer these over an Oreo since the combined flavor is wonderful and they are organic. Now I wish I'd purchased the oatmeal and chocolate chip while the coupon offer existed. These small 6 packages will disappear too quickly at my house.

Knowing they are 100% Organic and have only healthy, pure ingredients not only makes them Taste Better but I (mom) feel much less guilty when I am enjoying them! My daughter demands that two of these always be present whenever I pack a school lunch. My toddler can't get enought so I have to hide them sometimes and my husband would sit down and eat half the container if I didn't shoo him away. Good Stuff!

review/summary: A little disappointed in Amazon Grocery...
review/text: I ordered the ginger lemon cremes, but was very disappointed to find Amazon screwing up so badly.  The outside of the box as shipped from the vendor to Amazon clearly says "VANILLA" in very large letters, but Amazon slapped a sticker with a barcode on it that tags the box of cookies as "ginger lemon cremes," so now instead of enjoying the ginger lemon cremes I had been looking forward to tasting, I have to go through the hassle of trying to return these and hopefully get Amazon to send me the right product a second time around.  So, now I have to wait to see if I actually get ginger lemon cremes in another few weeks or however long Amazon takes.  Boy, their service has gotten worse and worse every year since I started buying stuff from Amazon back in their early days.

Meanwhile I tried other kinds of Greek Honey and I begin to understand that it is different from other kinds of honey... It is thicker and even though not so aromatic it still tastes good, therefore I upgraded my rating. Not bad at all... just different.

review/summary: Not sure what all the hoopla is about...
review/text: This review is for the coffee, not the roaster (Jersey Shore Coffee Roasters). The roaster is fantastic. I would order from them again. True to their word, the coffee had been roasted 3 days before it arrived; the perfect time to give it a try. It came in a resealable gold foil/mylar exhaust pouch with a flat bottom. It was clearly labeled with the coffee type and roast date. Now on to the product.<br /><br />I've been curious about 100% Blue Mountain estate coffees for years, and after much research, the Mavis Bank Estate came up as one of two that I wanted to try. I ordered the 1/2 pound bag; partially because this bean is so %^#* expensive, and also because I didn't want to get stuck with a pound of beans I might not like, and wish I had the fifty bucks back in my pocket. I much prefer Kona or a Costa Rican peaberry to this. It's a nice coffee; maybe too "nice". If you're a connoisseur of mild coffees, this is the one for you. It makes Gevalia Light Roast taste like French roast. Too delicate for my taste. I made a few pots, and kept increasing the amount of coffee. It looked pretty scary whe I was using 6 scoops for five "cups", but always tasted bland and watery. I tried it with just a hint of sugar, and nothing else.<br /><br />I'm not into 100% dark roasts at all; I hate that burnt taste. In fact I use a medium roast for my espresso machine. I'll try running some of this through it. Maybe It'll extract some flavor from this curious bean.

review/summary: Great Upgrade!
review/text: I used to buy a different bag of dog food everytime I would go to H-E-B for my dogs..I KNOW, don't hit me! I'm horrible! :( lol. I had to buy dog food and puppy food since I have two dogs of different ages. Once my Chow started hitting a year though (thank the Lord!), I wanted to buy the same dog food for both my dogs. I started getting a litte more concerned about the quality of my dog food and this was the cheapest I could start off with. It's been amazing so far (it's been two months). My German Shepherd mix has actually gained weight and that made me so happy! I got her when she was 100+ pounds but I think the transition from owner to owner got her kinda sad and she dropped to the 70 pound range and no matter how hard I tried, she wouldn't eat. Now, she's always hitting up her feeder and is back up to 85 pounds. Her coat looks great; very shiny! It's also been good to my Chow. I had read better ingredients made the dog poop less and I didn't believe that until I purchased this food. It's a very surprising change. Overall, very glad I decided to be a more informed pet owner. This is the top rated dog food on Petco.com right now and all of the reviews concur with the fact that it's the best bang for your buck. VERY HAPPY!

review/summary: Prima Donna of Pops
review/text: I've loved European soft drinks since being introduced to them in Sweden as a teenager--"sockerdricka," a banana-flavored carbonated beverage, was my favorite.  Far more variety than their American competitors--and less sweet!  For a buck a can you can't beat a Limonata with its foiled cover (so chic, lots of cachet conveyed to the consumer even before the first sparkly sip) and its crisp, just-sour-enough flavor.  Count me a subscriber of this one (if only American beverage-makers weren't so terrified of marketing anything that wasn't loaded up and down (the adrenaline pattern of the consumer's blood sugar counts) with dozens of teaspoons full of sugar (call it fructose, honey, sucrose, dextrose--it's still gratuitous, unhealthy, taste-neutral sugar!).<br /><br />This has quickly become my second favorite drink available from Amazon.  The first is Blenheim ginger ale.  (Don't even consider any other brand, regardless of its price or "exotic" origins.  It's all bland.)  Blenheim is the only ginger ale that will clean out your sinuses, ream out your internal plumbing and, as James Brown used to say, put pep in your step and gut in your strut.  Burn, baby, burn!  (Could just as well be Blenheim's motto.)

review/summary: Great sour lemon taste
review/text: I hate sparkling water, so I was reluctant to try this for fear that it would taste like S. Pellegrino's sparkling mineral water...much to my amazement, I LOVE the taste of this! I love pretty much anything with a lemon flavor to it, and although this isn't really a lemon flavor per se, it has enough of a lemon taste to be called "limonata." This looks like a traditional soda, since it comes in a traditional soda aluminum can. This, however, is more of a carbonated sour lemon drink that is more cool and refreshing than any soda without being excessively sweet or syrupy like regular citrus sodas can be. The only catch is that it really is sour (not excessive, but fairly strong in sourness), so if you don't like sour things you will not like this drink. You are better off going with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4">San Pellegrino Sparkling Beverage, Orange, 11.15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, which is not sour at all and is more of a sweet, orange flavor. If you like lemons or if you are tired of the usual Sprite/Sierra Mist/Mountain Dew flavors then give this drink a try. It is a refreshingly different twist.

review/text: The perfect summer drink; not quite lemonade not quite lemon-flavored sparking water. It is about half way in between.  Do note that this isn't just flavored sparking water- there is some sugar added so you are looking at 150 calories or so a can.  Half of a can of soda or lemonade, but a lot more than just water and lemon slices added.  Still, I had a very hard time keeping them in the fridge this brutally hot summer and they were great in my brown bag lunches.

review/text: Very lemony and a bit sweet, this stuff is WAY better than what I was expecting. I took my daughter on a walk today and it was VERY hot, so we stopped by our local convenience store. I wanted a beverage that wasn't soda, and I already had a water in the stroller. I grabbed this, expecting it to be like perrier lemon, which is just so-so. I didn't want a soda because I generally don't do sugary stuff but I bought it without looking at the ingredients, in a hurry. I got outside the store and popped the top. It IS very much a soda, a lemonade soda in fact, but one without tons of ingredients (I checked after I tasted he sweetness of it). I gave my daughter a sip, and she started immediately fussing "shook, shook!" (juice lol) for more. This is one sodapop I'll definitely get again. It is DELICIOUS!!!

review/text: Finally a lemon soda really worthy of its name. All the usual ones, such as 7 up, Sprite, mountain Dew, and the million other generic-type citrus based soft drinks can't even compare. They are just too sweet and seriously lack any natural lemon taste. Also, the usual sweetener used for them is corn syrup, cheap to produce and with an objectional after taste. San Pellegrino Limonata has real lemon flavor because of the real juice content and is sweetened with real sugar. It's the new standard for the ideal citrus soft drink, as far as I am concerned.

review/summary: Sour Ball Soda...
review/text: If you're a fan of sour-ball candies, you might like this Italian-made drink. This product contains eighteen percent pure lemon juice [roughly two ounces]...a bit too much for the amount of fluid in an eleven ounce can. They loaded thirty-six grams of sugar into this beverage, but still, it was not enough to counteract the extreme sour taste. If you chill it way down, it becomes quite drinkable, but be forewarned, the acidic level is nearly caustic and may cause you to gasp. I had higher expectations for this drink, since its orange-flavored cousin is delicious. The old Latin admonition,'caveat emptor', definitely applies here.

review/text: These are not quite �Cornichons extra fins� or fine gherkins for the USA. Inside this huge can, the average cornichons size is much bigger then the ones found inside a jar from Maille or even Carrefour brand. The vinegar used is just pure white vinegar instead of the more refines white wine vinegar used for Maille or Carrefour. Inside this huge can, I only found like ~5 or 6 pickle white pearl onion. There is more pearl onion inside a Maille jar (220g jar)!?!<br />Furthermore, even if the cornichons are grown & packed in India, the quality is still there but not the refinement. Many of them still have a small stem attached.<br />In conclusion, this will not replace the french quality & refinement but for what we can find in the USA, for the quality/price, is still hard to beat especially when a Maille jar is selling for ~$5 (220g) in a grocery store & if you can find it!!!

review/summary: If you are looking for the right cornichon in the US, this is it
review/text: This very large can contains typical French style tiny gerghins.  Very sharp and crunchy.  If you are used to Dessaux brand or Amora brand, you will not be disappointed and the price is a fraction of what you pay in the better stores if they cary this item.  When I saw that these were made in India I was a bit worried that they would not have the taste I was looking for, but they proved to be excellent (Vinegar, tarragon, pickling spices - NO sugar) and tiny as supposed to be. I repack them for my pantry in recycled glass jars.  Now I have good cornichons to accompany charcuterie and cold meats as well as making sauces, steak tartat and whatnot. I am very pleased and have added this item to my Amazon shopping list.  Alas I am a bit in a pickle because I cannot stop eating them.

review/summary: Like eating rubber with a side of vinegar
review/text: Actually bought this exact item at the grocery store.  I love pickled eggs but these are absolutely awful.  It is all in the quality of eggs rather than the flavor really.  These eggs were just like rubber and the yolk had no discernible flavor.  These eggs are of just horrible quality and I'll be forced to throw the remaining out.

review/summary: Thank You Amazon
review/text: I live in E.Tennessee, near a very large ConAgra plant. (These are made by ConAgra.) I don't know if these are made here, or were brought to this plant, but they were always available at the "Company Store" day for employees. A friend used to work there and would buy a case or 2 for me every time they were available. Prior to that I had never seen the product. They ARE NOT available in any store near me and they are not available in Chicagoland where I moved from 12 years ago. I am absolutely THRILLED that Amazon has this product. Through the years I have made my own fat free "refried beans" and Mexican Rice, and tried to keep meal sized portions of each in the freezer, but there is absolutely nothing faster than grabbing a can of these, some cheese, onion, flour tortillas, and making quickie burritos. OR, try adding some jalapenos and cheese and having a great, healthy dip in a couple of minutes in the microwave. The spicing is just right, the consistency is just right, they are nutritious without out any calories from fat, and they are so versatile. (My homemade Mexican Rice thaws faster than my homemade "refried beans" did.) I hate admitting to such laziness and impatience, but at least I have this wonderful product to reduce my sense of guilt. Amazon, Please keep carrying these and start carrying the other 2 NO FAT versions of Rosarita Refried Beans!!!

review/text: Not as tasty as traditional Rosarita beans but, duh, these are fat-free so I'm not surprised. (I decided to try these because they're half the price.)

I do like Rosarita overall because of the great texture, but I won't buy fat-free again.

review/summary: Fresh coconutty--edges out Mae Ploy and Chaokoh
review/text: I use coconut milk on my low-carb diabetic, dairy-free diet to make whey shakes (sweetened with steveia), cocoa, and coffee as a creamer.  I even make coconut milk yogurt with it.  I have used the usually top-rated brands of both Mae Ploy and Chaokoh but both have preservatives I would like to avoid.<br /><br />This arrived today and I immediately make a shake for lunch, and it is my favorite...very fresh tasting, more "coconutty," thick (not as thick as the two mentioned above, but thick enough).  I use the whole can, add one can of water to make a quart.  I love that it's just coconut milk, water, and guar gum.<br /><br />Since I use so much of it daily and I use Prime Shipping, the savings on the automatic ordering help me out a lot.  Umm...now to make some coconut milk yogurt with this.

review/summary: Very Good, Organic and No Preservatives!!! (SEE UPDATES!)
review/text: We see why people like this brand of coconut milk.  We like it, too.  It is organic and does have guar gum (which is a food derived, natural ingredient), but it DOES NOT have chemicals/preservatives, which are bad for you.  It is thick and creamy when slightly warmed, has a strong coconut flavor and tastes better than the brands with added preservatives.  (We've tried a lot of them!)  The ingredients are coconut milk, water, guar gum---that's it!  I DO wish it said what percentage of coconut milk was in the can, some brands do, but other than that, we are happy with this brand.  It DOES NOT have an expiration date printed on the can (we wish it did).  The price is more than the brands with preservatives, which I don't understand, I wish it were lower, but if we want food with no preservatives/added chemicals, I guess this is what our option is.  Hopefully, the price will come down.  What we don't like is the shipping--9 out of 24 cans in the case were severely or moderately dented, which means we had to use them soon or immediately (not happy at all about that).  However, we will order this brand again.  UPDATE:  Ordered second case, case was shipped "as is", broke open during shipping, all 24 cans arrived severely or moderately dented.  Can't even open most of them with a can opener.  Completely unusable and not safe to use.  Unless packing for shipping changes, even though we love the product, we will not order again. Not happy about that, as we can't find a source to purchase locally.  UPDATE:  Contacted Amazon, they sent another case, better packing, only 2 cans minor dented.  Thank you, Amazon!  Will try purchasing again, as we love this stuff!

review/summary: Wonderful Product but Cans not Protected
review/text: I purchased this case of coconut oil from Amazon and this review is no reflection about them, it is more directed at the company Roland. I was exited to get this product and when it did come, it was in Roland's Box which was then inside of Amazon's box. So I realized that Roland's has their product already packed for Amazon to ship. After opening the box, all cans were dented and none were in good shape. I had to throw out 6 of the 24 cans because some of the dents were far more severe then the rest. With that said, I need to express how wonderful this milk is to use for smoothies and cooking. It has an amazing flavor with full fat. I lost 6 pounds since using it, without changing a thing in my diet or exercise. I use it for cooking veggies and in pancakes etc. But most of all I use it in my smoothies. I take one can which is 14 Oz and then pour in a quart mason jar, then I fill the remainder of the space up with purified water. It works out to 1/2 cup of milk equals 100 calories and about 1 Tablespoon of Oil fat from the coconut. I thought this was important because in Fife's book it is recommended that adults take approximately 3 Tablespoons a day for most weights and for very petite persons it is about 2 1/2 Tablespoons a day. So with that said, I use 1/2 cup of coconut milk in two separate smoothies a day which gives me 2 Tablespoons and then I cook with coconut oil to get the remainder that I need to get my quota or I use it directly on my skin. I feel totally different and I literally feel my cells coming to life.. My daughter suffers from horrible cycle pains of her monthly and after taking this for only 3 weeks her next cycle she was nearly pain free, It is truly a miracle for she suffered from disabling pain for years now and nothing helped her.<br /><br />I truly recommend this product, I also recommend Coconut Oil from Nutiva (extra virgin) for it is the purest one I have found yet on the market.<br /><br />For me I use it for my gallbladder issues. It has saved me much pain for I cannot take in any type of dairy or meats of any kind. I am trying to dissolve my stones by myself rather then opting for operation which can cause so many problems after surgery, not to mention the gallbladder has more uses then what is normally stated by docs.. Anyway, I use the coconut milk as 1/2 cup then add water to the blender to bring to the 8oz mark and then add 5 ice cubes. After this I add 1/2 cup raw organic beets cut up and then 1 cup of cucumbers, both these are amazing for gallbladder problems but not just that, they are amazing to cleanse your liver as well. Then I add 1 cup or more of greens to the blender, and 1/2 banana, a few cherries, or 1/2 strawberries, 5 blueberries, 5 blackberries or other berries, and any other veggie I can think of and blend with a Dr.Mercola Miracle Whey which has medium chained fatty acids just like coconut milk and wow, it is so delicious and what a way to get your veggies in... Dr.Mercola's products have no sugar but use of stevia..<br /><br />Anyway, I feel totally different and could not live without this stuff..<br /><br />If ONLY Roland's would find a way to have the product shipped to them without the damage of the cans.. This is a dangerous thing, for poisoning could take place. I'm sure its in the travel that it takes to get here to the U.S but their cans just roll around in the box, there is no padding what so ever.. So I guess I am saying that a person must realize they will or could lose more then a half dozen cans when it gets to you.. Someone should talk to the company about this. Other then that I think this product is much better then any other coconut milk on the market and I still do recommend it highly.

review/summary: First time user of coconut milk
review/text: I'd never tasted coconut milk and made the purchase because so many of the recipes in a recent cookbook purchase required coconut milk. I chose the Roland Coconut Milk based on the reviews and because it is organic. Well, I received my order a week ago and while I've not used the milk in any recipes, I'm hooked. I followed the advice of other reviewers and dilute the milk with a can of water and store in a glass quart pitcher. The only mishap was that I first used cold purified water so the milk wasn't smooth. In recent batches I heat the purified water to room temperature or a little warmer and then mix it with the milk. I've found the consistency to be much better.<br /><br />Also, many reviewers reported that some of the cans in their shipment were dented or otherwise damaged. The company must have corrected this issue because mine arrived in a tight fitting box with no damage.

review/text: I ordered this coconut milk (24 cans!) before and loved it ... lots of creamy coconut fat that was as delicious in my morning cup of coffee as it was in curry dishes.  I didn't hesitate to order again, but will have to try another brand next time.  Multiple cans were dented on arrival, and every single can we've opened has contained a thin watery liquid (with less "substance" than skim milk!) with a small, hard, waxy piece of solid mass that can't even be broken up with a spoon. This was a very disappointing purchase.

review/summary: product has changed for the worse
review/text: I agree with the two most recent reviews...I have been ordering this product through subscribe and save for about a year now and have gone through several cases of delicious creamy coconut milk. In May Amazon had a discount on this product so I ordered two cases, and so far the first few cans we have opened have been very disappointing. I too noticed a difference upon shaking the can, it was very liquidy and not at all how it used to feel. Upon opening it, there was no cream, it was very runny and looked oily. I didn't notice a bad taste with it, but it is nothing like the product I was used to. Tonight I used it to make coconut milk ice cream, and it was very gritty, not creamy, and never even froze in the ice cream maker like it used to (it was very runny upon scooping it out). I am very disappointed in the change in this product and will be looking for a new brand.

review/summary: Much better than soy milk
review/text: After reading about the effect soy products have on the thyroid system, I decided to replace my soy milk with coconut milk.  I have never been a big fan of coconut, so I was concerned I wouldn't like it.  I was really surprised.  I love it.  It tastes rich like whole cows milk but with a touch of coconut.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I don't know how much you can write about Coconut Milk, but I will give it a shot!  This stuff is great.  Very flavorful, with a nice sublte coconut flavor, not sweet or icky thick.  I've found that with Organic Coconut Milk I have to open it with a can opener because sometimes the top gets hardened (coconut cream) and you have to scoop it out rather than pour it out.  I use a full can every morning for my protein shake.  Since using coconut milk, rather than cow's or soy my skin, hair, nails, well being have much improved.  I use coconut oil and milk daily and have noticed a significant improvement to my overall health.  I also began using coconut milk because of it's healthy benefits based on Bruce Fife's books on coconut oils.  I get a case of Roland Organic Coconut Milk (24 cans) sent to me monthly using Amazon's subscribe and save.  It is the best deal out there on the best product I have found!

review/summary: It's now watery!  Don't buy!
review/text: Like many of the recent reviewers here, I was also a long-time subscriber of this coconut milk.  I can also confirm that my case originated from Sri Lanka; not Thailand like all the previous orders.  We use coconut milk weekly, so imagine my surprise to find yellow water, instead of creamy, thick, white goodness.<br /><br />Christine at Amazon was able to provide a refund, but was very non-committal about opening a work ticket for the warehouse to investigate this product.  Guess they're not going to insist Roland change suppliers.<br /><br />It was a good thing while it lasted.  Now to try to find an organic alternative... If anybody has found a decent substitute, please share.

review/summary: Revised comment
review/text: Update added 8/25/10: I recently found that Roland is comparable in fat content that that of Thai Kitchen brand. I have three different brands of coconut milk on my shelf, and each one uses a different serving size...ugh! Sorry about that. It is a good milk; however, Thai Kitchen still seems to be a fuller-fat content as well as more consistent fat content than Roland. That said, for the cost savings, for many uses, it's not a big enough difference to be of concern, so I'll just keep some of both on the shelf and use Thai Kitchen for my puddings and ice creams.<br /><br />Roland Coconut Milk is a very good-quality coconut milk; however, it only has 5g fat per serving, as opposed to the 14g fat per serving in Thai brand coconut milk. I checked out the nutrition info and ingredients to be sure I was ordering something comparable, but neglected to compare fat content. Unfortunately, this milk will not be able to be used in many of the recipes I need that 14g fat/serving for.

review/summary: I won't buy this again
review/text: I have to say that I looked at the high marks that this got but didn't read the recent reviews. Silly me.<br /><br />This coconut milk is thin and I don't believe as good quality as some other ones on the market.<br /><br />The tins came in a big box and at least a third were badly dented.<br /><br />I won't be buying this again and would suggest you look elsewhere for your coconut milk.

review/summary: Last time I ordered it sucked.
review/text: First two times I ordered the milk was awesome.  Last time I ordered two cases they were all smashed and the milk was horrible.  I was unable to return it because amazon said it was nonreturnable. The first two times I got the milk I would have given five stars, now I would advise against buying it.  They can't even stand by their product by allowing a return on a bad batch.

review/summary: Inedible!
review/text: I ordered one case a number of months ago and was really impressed -- some of the best coconut milk I'd had.<br /><br />Then I received a case a couple weeks ago. I noticed it had a bit odd consistency, no cream on the top, but made a curry with it anyways, and was unable to finish it! I later tried to make a smoothie with it and almost vomited. What the hell happened to this product?<br /><br />Disappointed, and not going to order from Roland again, even if they improve -- I don't trust their quality control.

review/summary: second time around not a winner
review/text: I used to order this over a year ago on a subscribe and save basis, and was quite happy with it.  I just re-ordered it, and opened 3 of 24 cans only to find that it was watery, and smelled off.  I am definitely NOT ordering this again, and was told I could not return it to Amazon as it is a food product.  I had to beg and plead with their customer service to get a refund.  Caveat Emptor!  This is not the same great product it used to be...

review/summary: Inconsistent quality
review/text: I placed my first order for this product in March of 2011, and I was very pleased with what I received (I had never tried coconut milk before).  The coconut milk was thick and creamy.  If I didn't shake the can before opening it, there was a layer of (very tasty) cream at the top.<br /><br />I finished my first case at the end of May and decided to sign up for Amazon's subscription plan for Roland Coconut Milk.  The new case arrived very quickly, but the content of the cans was not the same.  This time, the coconut milk was watery and had a flavor I was not fond of.  There was no layer of cream at the top of the can, and it just sounded differently when I shook the can (being of much thinner consistency).<br /><br />Both products were Roland Organic Coconut Milk.  I did notice some slight differences on the cans.  The thicker, tasty, non-subscription cans were "AUSTRALIAN CERTIFIED ORGANIC," had a 2004 copyright, and were a product of Thailand.  The watery cans that came with the subscription had a "KLBD" symbol on them, were certified by Control Union Certifications, had a 2010 copyright, and were a product of Sri Lanka.  Both cans listed the same ingredients and nutrition information.<br /><br />I should also note that I had no problem with the packaging of my first, non-subscription order.  There were very minor dents on about 1/4 of the cans, but nothing that made me consider throwing them away.  The packaging of the subscription order was a mess.  It was completely falling apart and a can fell out of the box when I picked it up.  I haven't actually opened the box, I've just slid the 2 cans I've opened out of the holes in it.  The one can that fell out was dented, but I think this was a result of the fall.  The other can was in good condition.<br /><br />If I had reviewed this product after receiving my first order, I would have given it five stars.  The lack of consistency in the product quality and the poor flavor of the 2nd order lead me to give this product a 1 star review.

review/summary: Roland coconut milk - only half fat
review/text: I bought this expecting it would be like my local coconut milk, but it is only half the fat and no where on Amazon did it say that.  Most of the cans are dented and I am quite disappointed.  I won't buy again.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I have ordered this product in the past and been quite pleased with the quality; since we are dairy-free, I use a lot of coconut milk.  However, my most recent order has revealed that this coconut milk is not what it used to be.  It is watery, the coconut cream portion is hard and can't be whisked into the milk like it should be.  There is NO way you could use this coconut cream portion - it is anything but creamy.  I am so disappointed, and now I'm stuck with a whole case with limited useability and have wasted my money.  I just canceled my subscription to this item; I will not be ordering it ever again!
