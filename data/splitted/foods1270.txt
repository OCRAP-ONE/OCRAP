review/summary: Perfect for beginner eaters and toddlers too!
review/text: I purchased these when my infant son decided he hated being spoon-fed and wouldn't eat any jarred baby food. I saw these on Amazon and decided to give them a try. I loved the packaging and the fact that they're organic fruit.  Well, he loves them! He can hold them himself and suck the contents through the hole on top. No mess, happy kid. My 4 year old daughter loves them too...I just toss a bunch in my bag when we're heading out so I always have a simple, tasty, healthy snack on hand for both of them. Ok, fine, I'll admit it: I have several in my desk at work and I eat them too.  The fruits are all really good! It's like a little smoothie. This flavor (banana) happens to be my favorite.

review/summary: 2 year old still requests it!
review/text: Short and sweet, these are a God send!<br />Might suggest instead of purchasing online, having your child try it at the store first. Our child likes one and then grows out of it, moving on to the next flavor. The price here is WAY more than we pay at Babies R Us (Usually on sale 10 for $10) or Target ($1.29) but we LOVE giving organic food and it seems to be a big hit!

review/summary: Great for traveling or throwing in your diaper bag
review/text: My son loves these and they are great to put in your diaper bag when you are out and about or on a trip.  It is all fruit so that makes me feel better about giving them to my son.  He is 1 and a lot of times we can't find fruit that he can eat when we are out so these really help in those instances.  He drinks it right from the pouch.

review/text: Personally I thought they smelled a bit too much like overripe bananas, but my husband who I bought them for loves them! He has to have lots of potassium everyday and sometimes the store is out of bananas (our preferred easy source of on the go potassium naturally), so this was the perfect alternative! He loves them, they're organic, so I highly recommend them!

review/summary: Smaller version of the Plum purees.
review/text: I know this says it's for toddlers but our toddler was eating these well before his 12mo birthday. The MishMash is essentially just a slightly more textured puree for slightly older kids. The smaller size of these (3.17oz vs the 4+oz ones) make them a great on-the-go snack or squeeze half of this into a plain yogurt or oatmeal for a little extra taste. Our kid loves these...can't recommend Plum products highly enough. He also gets to feed himself which is perfect since he think he's Mr. Independent.

review/text: I bought these for my 10-month-old, and my 2-year-old. I opened one up for each of them when we received them, and my 2-year-old daughter inhaled the entire thing in one breath. My youngest slurped hers up in less than 1 minute (while it usually takes her 15 minutes to eat a 4 oz jar of food). They love these so much. My eldest is constantly begging me for them now.<br /><br />I did try one for myself, and thought it tasted a little funny, but that's my adult taste buds. There couldn't be anything better than these according to the little ones. =) I'll definitely buy these again. It's such a great treat, and so easy to grab when on the go. Great for breakfast, snacks, lunch, or any time!

review/summary: nearly indestructible
review/text: This toy holds up pretty well to the antics of my extremely chewy "destructo dog" Luna.  She's a lab-pit mix and she can destroy nearly every toy, even the ones that are marked as super tough or indestructible.  She is on her second of these and it's looking pretty worn, but it lasted for several months.  With her, that is pretty much miraculous.  Plus a high energy dog gets a lot of joy out of a frisbee.  My girl loves to chase it and carry it around for as long as you have the energy to play.

review/summary: same ole frisbee same ole quality
review/text: I would just like to say that this frisbee has always been my favorite and my dog max's as well(when you first get it you should wet it down with water because it's a little light)but after a little time it will break in and fly perfect, you just need to know what direction the wind is blowing when playing with it(these will normally last my german shepherd four-six months,using it one hour per day every day)with an aggressive playing dog.This is not a chew toy,it's used for excersising(so to all the people that let their dogs chew it,wrestle with it and use it for hanging from in the air)don't complain about how long it lasts(just complain about the lack of common sense your using playing with it)If you have a less aggressive dog this frisbee will last a very long time and please your dog every time you play.If you expect more from this product you'll have to take care of it.cleaning it with water,keeping it away from the dog untill play time(so they don't chew it to bits)just use common sense so you and your dog can have fun and enjoy it.Final thought,even if this frisbee starts to show age and have a couple of holes here and there you can always get a needle and thread to repair the damage and save on buying another one.I bought three of these from (little family members) for like $12.50 each, they not only arrived on time but those guys provided a five star service.when I need more of these frisbees in the future I will not hesitate to buy again from both the seller(little family members or the product booda).

review/text: My golden retriever/ yellow lab cross loves frisbee and as long as we have the booda soft bite all other frisbees are rejected.  It doesn't hurt her mouth and she enojoys shaking it.  It flies well even when I throw it.  light weight and high visibility in the tall grass.  It lasts a long time considering that she plays with it daily.  There are others that last longer but that is also because she won't play with them as much.  I don't leave her unattended with the frisbee because she tends to destory it and the grass in the process.

review/text: I got my dog this thing because his old one has about had it. The old one is still in use but is weathering away after almost 2 years of daily use. It never tore and still flies good just not as far. The new one I got showed me how weathered the old one was. It is the same great frisbee as the old style and I can throw it straight about 35 yards. I really think this is a great performing frisbee and will not ever chip or break my dogs teeth. Will last for a good while if you put it away from your dog after your done and do not let the dog keep it. It is made for catching and not tug of war or a chew toy.

review/text: This is a great product.  I have one from 10 or 12 years ago and is bleached out from the sun and rain while laying around in the yard.  Still works great.  Just enough lettering left to know what name to look for and have ordered several new ones.  My dog loves them and can not distroy one in week, a month or even years. Most other toys are gone in a few weeks. The stitching around the edge is the only occasional failure point but it is due to my Border Collie using it as a tug toy and chew toy as well as a fly and catch toy. I think it is probably the best toy I have found for my very active 50 lb dog.

review/summary: Best Dog Disc
review/text: Our miniature Australian shepherd loves his dog disc time. The construction is easy on the dog's mouth, but doesn't hold up to tugging. Our dog also likes to sometimes "kill" the disc before handing it over. He grabs it and violently shakes it. Again, a plastic disc would do better, but this is the best. We try to have two or three on hand. The expense is a bit high, but I do find it less expensive online than in brand name pet stores.

review/text: I have loved this tea for many years, but haven't seen it in stores for a long time.  I was glad to find  it on amazon and at such a great price.  This tea has all the vanilla, cinnamon and spice aroma of chai, and all of the rich aroma of a smooth lite roast arabica coffee, without any caffeine, or even any coffee. It's a roasted barley based beverage.  It truly is lovely on a cold winter night, it reminds me of Christmas.<br /><br />(My one tip is, don't steep it for too long.  Longer than about 5 minutes and it starts to loose it's magic.)

I am scared they will discontinue this, though my husband is convinced that will never happen.

review/summary: Tasty? Yes. Coffee Substitute? No.
review/text: Roastaroma is very tasty as a non-caffeinated hot beverage and that is how I think of it.  Those who use it as a coffee substitute must drink their coffee sweetened.  I do not, so Rostaroma tastes NOTHING like coffee IMHO.

review/summary: Loved this for years
review/text: I'm a caffein addict and die-hard coffee drinker, but once I've had my fix, more coffee makes me jittery.  Also, I can't drink coffee after a certain hour if I intend to get any sleep.<br /><br />I drank Roastaroma back in the 90's and loved it, and recently started hankering for some.  You can imagine how pleased I was to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price!  Thanks so much!  Now I can enjoy a rich, warm cup anytime.

review/summary: Ain't worth it.
review/text: I rarely write reviews, but concerning this product I had to.<br />I unfortunately suddenly developed a caffeine allergy and have had to use substitutes. Used Postum as a child, but it is no longer available. Cafix and Roma Kaffree are quite reasonable. I use a bit of each together, and that's fine.<br />Celestial makes many good products, but this is not one of them. Tried Roastaroma tea in small and larger amounts, and the stuff is absolutely vile. Very medicinal in taste.<br />Nothing tastes like tea or coffee, but this is a poor substitute.<br />I really do not know how it received 16 5 star reviews.<br />Good luck if you want to try it, but first get some locally before you buy the 6 packs offer thru Amazon.<br />Amazon/vendor are fine, and Amazon kindly refunded my money.

review/summary: Best tea ever
review/text: Best tea I've ever had, and I'm no spring chicken.  I drank coffee until about 8 years ago.  Lately I've been craving a coffee substitute.  Something I could enjoy at home, but that wouldn't keep me up or give me the coffee jitters.  Decaf never really did it for me.  But this tea is the best.  I probably would have been drinking this instead of coffee years before I gave up coffee if I'd only known about it.<br /><br />This tea mix will be in my kitchen from now on.  And when I travel I will take a few bags with me.  In fact I'm going to put a few in my travel bag right now.<br /><br />Get some, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Wonderful tea, but not really a coffee substitute
review/text: The box says it's a "full-bodied, caffeine-free alternative to coffee." I wouldn't say it's an alternative to coffee, but it really is a very tasty and unique tea. When I first opened a box, all I could smell was cinnamon, which made me think I was going to hate this tea. As soon as I poured hot water into my mug, the smell changed completely and so did my expectations. The cinnamon scent wasn't as dominant as it was when the tea bag was dry, and there was a wonderful chicory scent that gave me hope. The hint of allspice and star anise compliment this tea perfectly without overpowering it. It tastes like nothing I've ever drank before, and even though it doesn't taste much like coffee to me, I like it so much that I drink a cup almost every day.<br /><br />The only reason that it doesn't get five stars is because it's a bit weak for my taste, and one bag is only strong enough for a small cup. If I want to drink a big mug I need to use two bags. Let it steep for five minutes before you drink it, which helps get the most flavor out of it. I personally do not need to add sugar to this tea, the cinnamon, carob, and star anise make it somewhat sweet.<br /><br />My favorite way to enjoy a good cup of Roastaroma is with a cinnamon or almond flavored treat, like a cinnamon roll or almond blondies. I find that these flavors compliment the tea perfecly.<br /><br />The ingredients are not listed on this page, so here they are in case you're curious: Roasted barley, roasted chicory, roasted carob, cinnamon, allspice and Chinese star anise.

review/text: I purchased this in the hope that I could make coffee like beverages from it.  from the cup I just drank (hot)it seems like it will work just fine for making "iced coffee"  and mocha like beverages.  I love this brand!!!  it does smell like cinnamon out of the box but it stated to smell simmalar to coffee once i slipped it into water, once it was brewed though it did smell like coffee but close to it. it is a bit weaker compared to coffee at one bag per cup, even if you seep it for a long time.  bitter,black, hot, ya that's like coffee.

review/summary: Tastes great, just not like Postum
review/text: I guess on it's own it deserves 5 stars, but because I bought it as a potential replacement for Postum, which it doesn't mimic in flavor or taste. I give it a 4.<br /><br />I ordered this along with Cafix and Pero Extra to try the three and find an acceptable substitute for Postum. I'm a former Postum aficionado and had certainly developed quite a liking to Postum.<br /><br />Really can't take Pero Extra very much. I keep trying it again and again, prolly 10 times now, to see if I can develop a liking for it and just can't. I'm sure some people may like it, but it's just not for me.<br /><br />Cafix is what I'll usually go for, but it has a certain sort of built in slick sweetness (very mild, barely distinguishable)which comes from the beets that are added. Over time I've found it just sort of fills in some of the void from lack of Postum, and while it's not a Postum replica it has certain Postum like qualities.<br /><br />The Roastaroma actually is what I think tastes the best of the three, but its taste is just not at all like Postum, it is however very balanced and has a nice maltiness to it. Often I'll put just a little bit of Stevia powder in it. (I could always tell if I've ingested aspartame by (or nutrasweet, whatever) by how I felt, and try to verify any food/drink I ingest doesn't have aspartame. I mean, an item which arose out of research into nerve agents for warfare, and itself found to be an effective weapon, really shouldn't be passed off as a food item. Stevia is ground plant matter, even less processed that sugar.)The combo makes a really nice morning or late evening drink.

review/summary: nice bite to these!
review/text: This is my go-to pasta now!  I discovered it while searching for more organic staples to add to my pantry in a local store.  It cost twice as much as Amazons price!  I was pleasantly surprised when these were cooked to find out that they have a very firm texture and don't get limp and starchy like the national brands.  These are so great for my sauce dishes but they really work for dishes that you cook in the oven.  Baked ziti is now baked fusilli and the difference is night and day with the texture and taste.  Wow are these great!, and the other varieties / shapes preform equally well in all my recipes.  I'm on automatic delivery with three varieties.

My usual pastas are DeCecco and Barilla and although they are good, Bionaturae is fantastic.  First of all, the flavor of the pasta itself is delicious.  Second, the texture is superior in that it has no slightly gummy spots intermixed with the al dente.  Buy it.  You'll be on your way to a great pasta experience.

review/summary: If it's not Scottish, it's CRAP!
review/text: Received my CO2 chilled box a few days ago and transferred my sausages to the fridge with no issues. Very speedy shipping and excellent packing. Great shipping in the winter down here in FL, as the sausages were still ice cold when opened after sitting on the front stoop all day until I got home from work.<br /><br />Appearance: Just like the picture, expect a wonderful meat tube of dark sausage wrapped in a delicate casing. I opened the tube by cutting the ends and gingerly slicing down the length of the curve to tease it away from the sausage. To prepare, I sliced the sausage with a sharp knife into manageable 2" lengths for hearty eating (slice thinner if preferred).<br /><br />Cooked: Simply in a pan with some olive oil, although the oil wasn't necessary. Used medium heat and a longer cooking time turning the sausage pieces evenly in 1/4 inch turns and allowing the sausage to rest a good 2 mins in-between turns. Heat thoroughly until done. Carmelization was nice and the smell was wonderful.<br /><br />Taste: Amazing. Velvety smooth blood pudding taste with hints of star anise, pepper and salt, and just how I remember it from childhood. Crispy exterior from the cooked casing and melt-in-your-mouth warm center. This sausage is absolutely authentic and delicious.<br /><br />I can't recommend this black pudding enough to anyone craving a UK/Irish authentic flavor.

review/text: As far as digestive biscuits are concerned, McVities makes the best, no question.  The Milk Chocolate variety is alright, but the chocolate coating is rather sweet.  The sweetness definitely overwhelms the taste of the chocolate, and does not blend so well with the cookie.  If this is all you have tried, you will like it, but the Plain Chocolate variety is so much better.  The chocolate coating is not bitter (as some dark chocolate varieties can be)- it is still sweet, but the chocolate flavor is stronger and contrasts with the cookie much better.  This Milk Chocolate variety can be found at World Market.

review/summary: The chocolate I received is moldy!
review/text: I received this chocolate yesterday, from the clear plastic box, you can tell there are green/white mold coming out of the chocolate. It is so gross. I am so glad i didn't send this as a gift to my friends and family. I will return this immediately. This makes me question the credibility of this seller. Buyers should watch out. And plus you can get the same exact box of chocolate in Walgreen this week for only $7.99. I think this seller are way overpriced.

review/text: Instead of having only the Rocher truffle, this box also offers a couple of other Ferrero chocolates - Rondnoir and Garden Coconut.<br />While the product presentation is really good (and impressed the people to whom I gave it), I am not a particular fan of these chocolates due to their relatively soft flavor.

My order (Steak Rub and Fish Rub) arrived on schedule, nicely packed and in good condition.<br /><br />If you have never tried Szeged, I highly recommend the Steak, Fish and Chicken seasonings.  Chicken is not only good on chicken, but is wonderful on grilled vegetables.<br /><br />I personally do not care for Pork Rub.  I use the Steak Rub on pork as well as on beef.

review/summary: How to use Sugar Cure to make Canadian Bacon at home.
review/text: You can use this old fashioned product to make your own "knock your socks off" Canadian style Bacon. It's really simple, even though it takes 6 days and a little room in you fridge.  First requirement is, you must have a smoker/grill.  I use a large Big Green Egg. The recipe and instructions follow: For each one pound of Pork Loin (boneless) 1 tbs of Morton Sugar Cure,  1 tsp of white granulated sugar,  1 tsp of Dark Brown Sugar.  Add sugars to a small bowl and mix well by hand. Don't use the smoke flavored cure as it can be awfully tricky to get it right. The regular cure is a great product and easy to use.<br />Prep the Pork loin: most pork loins average 9-10 lbs, this is good size to use.  I like to cut them into thirds, approximately 3 lbs or so each as this size fits perfectly into 1 gallon freezer bags.  Cut, rinse under running water, then pat dry using paper towles and place one pc in a bag.<br />Back to cure mix, I like to mix the sugars for 3 lbs each in smaLL bowls and mix, this way I'm sure I get the right amount on each pc of meat.  Pour the cure mix into the bags, then using one hand reach into each bag and knead the mix into and all over the meat. When finished mixing the bags, wash hands and fold over top of bag squeezing out all air, then zip close.  Place bags flat on a shelf in your fridge. Once every 24 hoursflip the bags ( keeping closure folded over the top)The cure will draw moisture and create a brine (this is good, do not drain)  Do the flip routine for 5 days. On the 6th day remove from fidge, rinse off, then place the meat in a bowl of clean cool water and let soak for an hour to remove part of the salt. Will be too salty if you don't do this.  Dry meat put meat back into fridge, covered to chill down while you prep your smoker/grill.  Get your smoker to 225-250 degrees, steady,throw in a pc of hickory wood, then place the 3 pcs of cured loin into your smoker with a temp. probe in one pc.  Slow cook until the temp. of the meat reaches 160-165, then remove immedialtely.  Any higher will dry out the meat (160 is best).  Let meat cool down, then wrap and put in fridge over night.  Remove next day, slice about 1/8" thick and enjoy the best darn Canadian Bacon you ever eaten.  Canadian bacon in the stores is $8-$10 a lb and nowhere near this good.<br />If you enjoy grilling/smoking, you'll enjoy this.  A little time consuming but by no means is it hard to do.  This Morton's Sugar Cure is a great product that makes it all easy.

review/summary: Dog treats
review/text: My dogs always loved these Chicken Breast Nibbles. I use to get it in my local pet store,and had to pay a lot more. Unfortunately I have decided to stop buying things made in China for my dogs, so I can't buy these anymore. This company was very fast and easy to deal with. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again for things made in the USA.

review/summary: Delicious and Healthy Doggie Treats
review/text: In our home, Maxx gets excited when asked if he wants a 'chicken cookie'.  He'll do anything for one of these dehydrated discs of chicken.  Between the size of a quarter and a half-dollar, these 'cookies' are easily snapped into smaller serving sizes (very useful for training treats).  They come in a see-through plastic container with a screw-top lid.  Besides the size and convenience being a plus, so too, is its ingredient:  100% pure chicken.  There are no additives, no fillers.  Another plus is that, this product doesn't have an offensive dog food smell.  I feel that I'm giving my dog a healthy treat when he's rewarded with Chicken Nibbles.<br /><br />Whenever friends visit with their dogs I give them Chicken Nibbles, too.  They love them so much that, their owners inevitably ask where to buy them.  They used to be found at a big box pet store but, no longer carry them.  I'm delighted to have found them at Amazon.com.  Now we can all buy them right here.<br /><br />About Cost:<br />A container usually lasts a few months so, the price is not unreasonable.  When you consider that, you probably buy a variety of treats in smaller quantities (more frequently), there is not much difference in cost.  When you don't have to make a trip to the pet store, there is savings, too, in having it delivered to your home.  There are further savings when you buy through Amazon Prime; there is only an annual fee and not one for each time that you make an Amazon purchase.

review/summary: Cats Love Them Also.
review/text: My cats love these chicken nibbles. A one pound container lasts about seven to eight months. That's for two cats. This container may last a year if you only have one cat. There are a lot of treats in the container. I don't feed them these everyday. If you do feed them to your cats I have found that it is easier for them to eat if you break up the treat into four little pieces. My only concern was that they are made in China. The label says 100% chicken breast but I can't help but think there is something else in them. At just under $20 including shipping, I think it's a great value. You can also find these in your local pet stores however I have never seen them at places like Target or the grocery store.

review/text: I was first introduced to these doggie treats by my counselor,  who had them for her dog and visiting pooches.  They are made of 100% chicken breast and are about one inch in diameter.  The only negative is that they are made in China, but they do have good reviews throughout the Internet.  I break them into quarters for my 9 lb pooch and use them for training too.  She can easily chew a full one without breaking it in pieces.  They stay crisp in the plastic container and are not too difficult for my dog to chew.

Of course I had to go purchase them and now it is by far my dog's favorite treat.  I also give them during her training sessions and she thoroughly enjoys her rewards.

review/summary: James Bond's Favorite Whisky
review/text: It is completely understandable why Talisker would be Ian Flemming's scotch of choice for the James Bond character (in the books anyway). The spirit of Talisker is like no other single malt. Never subtle and always delicious.<br /><br />The 25 is the most refined, IMHO, and my favorite from this great and uncompromising distillery. Sweet peat, smokey, pepper and ginger spices, rich and fruity, (a touch of spring water brings out some of the floral character), a buttery smooth mouth feel and a long warming finish make this a must try for all single malt enthusiasts. The 25 year old changes a bit in character from year to year but not enough to worry about so seek out any year you can. Because this distillery tends to be overlooked by the masses, the 25 YO is a great value. It is a muscular whisky of great craftsmanship. An real gem of a whisky. Careful though, it is not a starter malt and doesn't take kindly to strangers who rush in. Approach it carefully, introduce yourself slowly and give it a little time to breath or it may bite back! Highly recommended.

I was really disappointed to discover on opening the first can that these beans are not peeled.  The remaining cans have been sitting in my pantry.  Last night I decided to bite the bullet and spent 30 minutes peeling to make fava hummus, which ended up tasting terrific.  But who does Progresso think they are kidding, the skins are inedible.

The price on the powder from Amazon costs $1.50 to $3.50 less than what I found in the health food stores in my area. It's also much, much cheaper than buying the milk in the carton (which ends up being about $16-20 a gallon!)  The only issue I've had with the powder is that it can clump up sometimes if you don't use water that is warm enough or don't shake vigorously and/or stir immediately.  Otherwise, we love it!
