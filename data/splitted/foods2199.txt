review/summary: Love these!
review/text: I am on a gluten free diet and prefer a bar that is low in sugar, high in protein and tastes good.  This totally fits that bill.  They are great for a mid-morning or afternoon snack or to carry with you incase you're stranded and need sometime to tide you over and give you energy.

review/summary: Sooo Good!
review/text: I am new to macrobiotics, so I am still training myself  to stay within the guidelines, but sometimes I either need a quick healthy snack or a treat to reward myself. These bars are really yummy. They are a little small to use for a meal replacement, but they make a great snack or a healthy dessert alternative. I have tried four of the flavors, and so far these are my favorite, but they have all been good. I hope this company is successful and someday the price might come down a bit more, but it's a great way to pamper myself. Enjoy!

review/summary: My favorite gluten free food bar
review/text: I am gluten intolerant and this bar suits my needs perfectly. It's not very sweet, but it's satisfyingly sweet enough to taste really good and has a definite peanut butter flavor... It's a perfect "go to" snack when I don't want to<br />indulge in rich desserts but am just craving something tasty. I often eat a bar in the movies and don't feel deprived knowing that other people are eating candy..... The peanut butter is my favorite flavor. You need to be careful when buying these Macrobars as some of these bars are made with gluten sweeteners like barley malt.  When I saw these bars for the first time, displayed in a health food store in another state, I had a difficult time distinguishing the gluten free bars from the regular ones.  I'm not following a macrobiotic diet, but I like knowing that this bar<br />is a very healthy gluten free option to eating a quick meal on the go. It's not always easy to find totally gluten free meals away from home,....so, I always keep a Macrobar in my purse just in case I'm feeling hungry.

review/summary: Best Salt? nope.  Best Smoked Salt? yup, the best ever
review/text: The respect, the care shown by these people at The Spice Lab in the handling and packaging of their salts is obvious. Plus, I'm sure they use rocket ships for delivery, too. I probably have 10 or 12 of their various salts so far (in regular use)...simply because it's fun, plus salt is cheaper than truffles. And I never seem to tire of experimenting. A few of the salts I possess have been smoked by folks in exotic locales, But other than their Course Pink Himalayan (best, by far, I say), I love experimenting with their Washington (Yakima Valley) applewood smoked salt. Using wood taken from their orchards, they're able to create a taste I love. Their apples must really be something.<br />I recently presented this salt with a cheese plate, and suggested modesty in it's use (Cheese? Why? don't know. Sounded good then). It was a huge hit. I frequently buy brussel sprouts just to see the sprouts joy when I introduce this salt (joy causes tasty). Good Vanilla ice cream becomes so much more...etc. A bit pricier than some others they offer? Yes, but worth it. Oh?... Well, have you ever begun salivating, simply by thinking of a brussel sprout?<br />I say try it. Now i'll shut up.

They hold any sauce exceptionally well, and just have that perfect consistency you're seeking in your recipes.  I've been using these for years and seldom buy anything else.

review/summary: I love 'em!
review/text: This is a 3 pack and the price is pretty darn good, this price is cheaper than you'll find 17oz boxes on sale in the local supermarket. But you'd have to buy 3, but that's not a hardship for those who love this cereal. However, I've noticed that the new boxes with the word "Fiber" on it taste a little different from the old boxes. I don't know if anyone else has noticed. The Froot Loops seem to be less crisp and more woody in texture. I hope they didn't mess with the formula because I don't really buy this cereal for the fiber, I buy it for the taste.<br /><br />Froot Loops is one of Kellogg's troika of cereals that Moms hate but kids love! (The other two of the Corn Pops and Apple Jacks.) I suspect the reason behind this is that neither the word "Froot" nor the word "Loops" are consider true food words, to Moms, these two words signify sugar and artificial colors. However, scientifically speaking, neither is truly bad. In today's age you can hardly avoid artificial coloring unless you want to eat gray and beige colored food and a serving size (3/4 cup) only gives you 12g of sugar vs. 39g in a 12oz can of Coke, so the word is moderation.<br /><br />I love it because it tastes good and I love the texture, it's crunchy without being too hard. And surprisingly, if you check the nutrition panel, there's 25% RDA of quite a lot of nutrients in it.<br /><br />So:<br />Pros: Tastes great.<br />Cons: Has the words "Froot" and "Loops" in the name so Moms don't like 'em.

review/text: If you are a fan of instant oats you'll love this brand. I happen to like several flavors from this company but this one is my favorite. The apple cinnamon flavor is sweet and not artificial tasting.  The oats have good texture - not gluey or gummy. Super convenient, efficiently packaged - comes in a *really* small box. No JUNK in the ingredient list either!<br /><br />I agree with other reviews that it's best to compare prices - for some reason there seems to be a very wide swing on this one.<br /><br />Overall, a quick and easy way to start the day with something good tasting and good for you too.

review/summary: Great Taste and Very Convenient
review/text: My wife and I picked up some packages of these of the dollar store and weren't sure if they'd be a good deal or not. Were very pleasantly surprised. I almost exclusively eat Quaker apple cinnamon oatmeal, but I really liked this brand.<br /><br />I have to comment on the great packaging idea of this product comes in. First, if you care it's post have lower amount of packaging than comparable products and be better for the environment. Anyway, the thing I really do like about this is the pouches are also the measuring cup. You take a bowl, tear the pouch open, dump out the contents, then you fill be empty pouch with water up to a line on the pouch, dump it in the bowl, stir and then nuke it for 90 seconds. I don't know why nobody is ever thought of this before in any of the packaging I've seen, but it saves the guessing at how much water to put in or caring stupid measuring cup around with you if you're eating it work like I do. My only minor gripe is the line it asks you to tear at isn't the area that had the tear point so I mistook the tear line for the fill line and put in too much water the first four or five times I used it.<br /><br />When we went back to the store we picked up another three boxes pulled me out for the next few weeks. Give the stuff a try. You won't regret it!

review/text: I once read that the genitals of female primates turn bright colors to attract males when they are in heat, well, this stuff turns your meat bright red to attract men to yummy food.<br /><br />Seriously, actual home made Char Siu, uses five spice, honey and other seasonings to flavor the meat, and it can substitute quite well if you can't get the NOH or other brands of this stuff, but, it wont dye your food the delicious shade of red as this stuff does, and duplicate the stuff you pay an outrageous price for in Chinese/Korean take out shops.<br /><br />I skip mixing this stuff into a marinade, and go directly to rubbing it in, skipping the H20, because it can only water this stuff down.<br /><br />Rub it onto pork butt steaks, or boneless ribs, marinate overnight, and you got damn good chinee pork.  On ribs, I do the same, one hour in the oven under foil, and the ribs are cooked soft, and PURPLE, or Chartreuse, or some other freaky color, then I finish it on the grill, and it turns back to red, and crisps over nicely in about 20 minutes over high heat.<br /><br />I served them at a family re-ONION, and everybody preferred these to regular red BBQ, and to Carolina Mustard BBQ, they are THAT GOOD!<br /><br />Next I want to cut a pork shoulder into thin, one inch wide strips, to maximize the surface area able to absorb the marinade, and try these as stick food, ala Ka-Bob, or meat on a sword.<br /><br />I have not tried this on beef, or chicken, only pork, but then again, I don't have any Muslim or Jewish friends to feed, but I think it might be OK on beef.  Chicken?  Maybe thighs, not breasts or anything too dry, you definitely want a fatty, juicy meat cut for this product, as the juice and grease tend to couple with the seasoning to create Umami-esque flavors.<br /><br />I LOVE THIS BRIGHT RED MEAT STUFF!

review/summary: Authentic Chinese BBQ Seasoning, The Best!
review/text: I think this week was my family's 3th time making Chinese BBQ spare ribs & Cha-Siu with NOH's Chinese BBQ seasoning and the flavor turned out perfect as always! The flavor is true to goodness "Cha-Siu" and I will confidently say that if you know how to cook in conjunction with this seasoning, your product will be even better & healthier than those found from Chinatown.<br /><br />The first time I decided to make homemade Cha-Siu, I used just this packet.  The end product was much too subtle in flavor when compared to Chinatown restaurant quality Cha-Siu.  It wasn't until my family devised a way to process and marinate the pork to produce even better results than restaurants.  I won't list the details (haha, it's now a secret family recipe ^_^ ), but will provide information that prior to using this seasoning mix, make sure to season & marinate your pork/ribs with cooking wine & sugar.  After a few days using this method, then mix in the NOH seasoning packet and let it marinate the meat for an additional few days.  These days of marinating the meat, especially the cooking wine + sugar in combination with the NOH seasoning really gives Cha-Siu that unmistakable flavor & aroma when finished cooking.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I was introduced to this product by my cousin. Quick and easy way to give some added flavor to your rice based meal. Many different ways to prepare, but my favorite is to marinate the meat in a slow cooker for the day, then add to my rice in the rice cooker. TASTY! Wife was a bit put off by the pink color at first, but the flavor pulled her past that. Looking forward to tryiong it in differnt ways.

review/summary: Authentic Taste - Easy to make!
review/text: Authentic taste and very easy!! I purchased this packet while I was in Hawaii.  I bought a 3 pound slab of pork ribs and sprinkled 1 1/2 packets of the seasoning and rubbed it in very throughly.  The other 1/2 of the packet I mixed with water and drizzled it over the ribs in a shallow pan.  Be careful because this spice does stain and turn your hands pink!  I let it marinate in the fridge for 5-6 hours. Remove the ribs from the fridge and set my oven at 350 degrees and covered the ribs with foil and let it slowly bake for 2 1/2 hours.  I then remove it from the oven and cook it on the grill at 375 degrees for 8-10 mins on each side.  If you want to add a simple glaze (honey and soy sauce) before you put it on the grill it will give it a good flavor.  Very easy and so delicious!  Use two tongs when putting it on the grill because the ribs will fall off the bone!  The Kalbi beef packet is just as good too if not better!

review/summary: tasty and high protein, not tough
review/text: When I needed something reasonably soft but high protein due to a dental problem, these Little Links really helped me out a lot. A few could give me half my protein requirement for the day without loads of chewing. I just sliced them up and heated in a convection/toaster oven for a few minutes, so it was easy to chew them on one side of my mouth. I imagine this would be a plus for little kids as well. Try them with sliced bananas ... Really! Bananas make a good side dish for savory items.  Anyway, I'll try to always keep them in stock from now on via Subscribe & Save. Oh, they're tasty even if you don't have any chewing problems!<br /><br />If they're not spicey enough for you - try getting some sausage type seasoning and cook them up with that. I like them the way they are from the can, though. The advantage of not being too spicey is that you can always add spice but you can't subtract it... Many times I don't want spicey because it can trigger a cough during the wrong season.<br /><br />I hope Worthington never messes up the Loma Linda line by adding egg whites as it does to much of the Worthington products. It's so hard to find egg-free items of this sort, but these are egg-free and dairy-free (vegan). I'm allergic to both dairy and egg.

It's the same addictively delicious taste I remember from my time in London -- and infinitely easier to purchase!<br />The cheese is scrumptious, and was shipped very carefully with ice packs to keep it fresh.  I recommend both the Cotswold and the vendor very highly.

You can go to [...] to buy smaller quantities at better prices direct from the manufacturer. The 5 star rating is for the product, not the price. Although the seller was quick on shipping.

review/summary: Great for SB & J Sandwhiches!!
review/text: My 5 year-old son has multiple, severe food allergies...peanuts and treenuts are biggies.  He's NEVER had peanut butter or anything with peanuts/tree nuts for that matter as he's been so allergic to things since he was about 12 months old.<br /><br />I found this product doing a Google search on "soy nuts".  He loves steamed edamame so I had to give this stuff a try.  I went to Shoprite last night to buy the soynut butter, gave it to my son for snack when I got home and he absolutely LOVES it!!  He's eating little SB & J sandwiches on rice crackers as I type.  (He also can't have gluten.)<br /><br />I bought the original creamy type.  It "sounds" like peanut butter when you break the seal, it smells just like peanut butter (honest to God!), has the same consistency of creamy peanut butter and tastes like it, too.  It has an ever so slightly different taste to it. I can't even tell you how excited I am about this stuff! I LOVE peanut butter but haven't had it in 3 years as a result of my son's allergies.  I would not hesitate for one second to put this on an english muffin with some jelly for my own breakfast.  It's delicious and a must have for little one's with peanut/tree nut allergies.

It's not exactly the same taste as peanut butter, but it is just plain good in it's own right.  We love it.  You've got to give it a try if allergies are an issue for anyone in your family.

review/summary: One of the best soy butters out there
review/text: As many commercial vendors (Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, etc.) stop carrying any type of soy butter at decent prices, it was great to see this available on Amazon.  Tried this for lack of any other available soy butter locally, and I am impressed.  The taste is one the best soy butters I've had, the price is competitive, and the separation factor is not so bad that it requires constant restirring like some soy butters.<br /><br />NOTE:  Those who are critical of the taste of any brand of soy butter and were duped into thinking the product is a "substitute" for peanut butter need to change their perspective.  Realize that if you do not like the taste of soy you will not like this any better.  But if you appreciate the unique taste and texture of soy products, you'll like I.M. Healthy as well or better than any other soy butter out there.

review/text: I have to say I was rather scared to try this not really knowing what I was going to get but I am so glad that I took the risk and tried this product. It tastes just like peanut butter only not as sweet or rich.  I loved its mild flavor so much, it has a great texture and the smell is so inviting.  Before buying online I would check your local health food stores first, just to make sure you like it, everyone has different tastes but all I can say is I am going to use this instead of peanut butter from now on.  YUM!  The nutrition facts are off on this product though, I have the same jar at home and for 2T it has 200 calories and 14 grams of fat, so thats a little confusing but I am going to trust what is on the actualy jar then what amazon is telling me here.

review/summary: 5 year old peanut butter addict likes this better!
review/text: My 2-year old was recently diagnosed with a peanut butter allergy.  My five year old eats pb&j almost every single day and LOVES peanut butter.  I was worried about having to make him stop eating peanut butter.  We tried a couple brand of soy butter -- one of which was really disgusting the others were so-so.  We tried this and my son says he actually likes it better than peanut butter.  I also love peanut butter and honestly can't tell the difference.  It is great!

review/summary: (For some) tastes better than peanut butter
review/text: My son has had children in his preschool classes for the past couple of years who have had peanut allergies, and we weren't permitted to pack lunches with peanut butter.  This product has been a very good alternative.  For me, I can take it or leave it, preferring real PB, and insofar as alternatives are concerned, I prefer cashew butter or sunflower butter.  It spreads like peanut butter, and has a stronger toasted flavor than PB.  I can't speak to the other varieties, but this one is pretty good.<br /><br />My son, however, requests this stuff over peanut butter when we're at home.  All.  The.  Time.  He's compartmentalized the taste as one that isn't a replacement for PB, but that is its own unique flavor.<br /><br />Our local grocers are raising prices to upwards of $7/bottle, so I'm very happy to see these multi-paks offered.

review/text: My girls started eating this soybutter around age 1 because i heard they should not have regular peanut butter until they where 3 due to so many peanut allergies. We have not stopped using it since. They are now 5 and rather have this than anything else. For some others it may be something to get use to, but we think it tastes great(including me) and want a healthy alternative to some of the other products on the market.

review/summary: Lots of soy taste ; far inferior to Wowbutter
review/text: We've tried several brands of soy butter when our daughter was flagged as being sensitive to peanuts. I'd pass on this soy butter in preference for Wowbutter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006HIY39I">Wowbutter (2 Pack)</a>. The I.M. Healthy has a LOT of soy taste that is unpleasant and unexpected for me, a lifelong peanut butter eater.<br /><br />The Wowbutter flavor profile is just a lot more similar to "real" peanute butter and is great for sandwiches. I don't know how the I.M. Healthy and Wowbutter would fare relative to each other when cooking with them.

review/text: Excellent product.  Good price, low cost delivery.  I switched to Soy butter because I found out PEANUTS and other NUTs make me break out with cold sores and sometime SHINGLES.  I don't eat peanut butter any more because I like the SOY better and it doesn't cause me any problems.  Try it, you'll like it!

review/text: If you are looking for a substitute for peanut butter that really tastes great, do yourself a favor & try this product.  After trying several non-peanut spreads, the IM Healthy SoyNut Butter is by far the best.  It has a great mild flavor & is creamy and delicious.  My kids have become fans, even though they ARE able to eat peanut butter. You don't have to purchase the 6-pack - it is available in singles, but you'll certainly come back after the 1st jar & buy the 6-pack.

review/summary: great alternative to peanut butter!
review/text: Bought this item at a local grocery store where they only sell organic stuff. My little one is allergic to peanuts, so i was on a quest to find a substitute. This is the first time I've heard that such product exist... and I LOVE IT. The consistency is dead on like peanut butter, the taste is pretty similar to peanut butter, but less nutty? By far i think this is a great alternative for those who are allergic to pb, and wants that pb&j sammie craving.

review/text: This brand has been consistently fresh, high-quality, and tasty.  My family has tried this variety, plus the unsweetened creamy and chocolate flavors.  Sugar vs. protein amounts are reasonable, so give it a try.  Usually we see this at the supermarket for ~$5.29 each, so $24-$25 per six-pack is a nice savings.

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: My daughter has a severe peanut, tree-nut allergy and after trying sunflower butter (very overpowering taste!) I was reluctant to experiment with another NON-peanut-butter. I'm so glad that I bought this. We all love it! Texture is the same as peanut-butter and the flavor is very similar, yet obviously not so peanut-y. Thankfully, it doesn't taste like soybeans (nothing against them but that isnt' what I think of when I'm craving the old peanut-butter!) Also, even though it's a "natural" product, we've only noticed quite a bit of seperation in just one jar. All the others (we buy these in packs of 6) are perfectly blended and stay that way. I've also used it in desserts and made some soybutter cups (think of the peanut-butter cups you can buy) using nothing but real chocolate and this soybutter and they turn out amazing! I am not a health-nut and only tried this soybutter for allergy reasons but I have to say that this stuff is good enough to eat right out of the jar!

review/summary: Excellent value for a product essential to a peanut-free home
review/text: Due to an allergy in the family, we use soynut butter instead of peanut butter.  The I.M. Healthy brand is indeed peanut free (you'd be surprised at how many soy nut butters actually include peanuts, are processed in the same facility as peanuts, etc).  The prices the local grocery stores charge for this product individually are outrageous.  The six-pack product on Amazon is a great deal - we go through it quickly enough that we don't have to worry about it going bad, etc, when we buy in quantity.

review/summary: Our favorite soy butter
review/text: One of my kids is allergic to peanuts, and in his 12 years we've tried all the substitutes.  My kids greatly prefer IM Healthy over other brands of soy nut butter, or sunflower butter.  They like all the flavors equally, creamy/chunky, with or without honey, and chocolate.  I can not purchase it locally for under $5/jar so this is a good deal.  For anyone looking to sub for PB in recipes, I have tried it with mixed results.  For recipes where the PB is just a little bit of texture or thickener (chili, egg rolls) it works fine.  For recipes where the peanut flavor is integral (PB cookies, etc) it obviously falls short for those of us who enjoy the actual taste of peanut butter.  But for making a substitute for someone with allergies who has never tasted the real thing...it's perfect!

I gave up on peanut butter altogether about 5 years ago. I was very pleased to finally find an acceptable substitute (Thanks to my wonderful GF!). Alone, honestly, doesn't taste exactly like peanut butter (still, tastes good). But, with grape jelly, oh man, i cant even tell the difference. SB n' J sandwiches are FTW!

review/text: I bought some of this yesterday at a rather large Kroger. This morning for breakfast, I had some coffee, a bowl of cereal, and some toast with this brand of soy nut butter. It looks like peanut butter, smells like peanut butter, and even tastes like peanut butter. In fact, I think this tastes better than any garden variety peanut butter you see in the store. It has a GREAT nutty taste. And it's not overly sweet. This is a winner!

review/text: I came across this product as I needed an alternative to peanut butter for my daughter in school.  She is 18 mos. old and a very picky eater.  She will only eat school (daycare) lunch 2 days out of the week so I was looking for an alternative to send to a peanut-free classroom.  From the first taste, there were no complaints or issues and she eats this on crackers, waffles and bread.  We actually switch back and forth btwn this and p.butter at home with no issues.  My 4-yr old son also has eaten the soynut butter and thinks it is p.butter.  I give this product 5 stars as a great alternative to peanut butter!!!

review/summary: A safe, healthy, and tasty alternative to peanut butter
review/text: I grew up eating peanut butter and loved it, but when my son was still a baby, we made the frightening discovery that he has a very severe peanut allergy. Needless to say, our family immediately, completely, and very happily dropped all forms of peanuts from our life.<br /><br />A couple of years then went by when I came across IM Healthy Soynut Butter at the supermarket. I bought a jar, figuring only that it might be nice to have this particular product among our snack food choices at home because it was so convenient and nutritious. I didn't at all, however, expect it to actually fill in as a complete substitute for how I'd enjoyed peanut butter my whole life previously -- but it has. Yes, the taste of soynut butter is different from peanut butter (Go figure...One's made from soynuts; the other, from peanuts :-D), but I can honestly say that I enjoy the taste of soynut butter equally. I now eat soynut butter the same way I'd always eaten peanut butter (in sb&j sandwiches, sb & bananas, sb & apples, sb & crackers, spoonfuls of sb right out of the jar, etc). Because my family eats it up so much, I regularly buy IM Healthy Soynut Butter as often as I used to buy peanut butter, too.<br /><br />It's nice to once again enjoy a nut butter and *know* that my son isn't being put at risk in the least.

review/summary: OK PB Sub....Does not taste like PB
review/text: I.M. Healthy Soy butter is a great alternative for children who have allergies or whose classmates have allergies.  Our 17 month old is in a class at daycare with another child who has nut allergies so we cannot send peanut butter.  This was a HUGE setback for us since that is our staple lunch.  After reading reviews we ordered a case of this.  We opened a jar upon delivery and it really does smell like PB.  The color is a little off, but the smell is right.  It does not separate or need to be put in the fridge, which was great.  My husband and I made a sandwich.  The initial taste is very much PB, but the finish is not.  It says with a hint of caramel, it should say a hint of broccoli.  The taste is very much vegetable.  Not bad, just vegetable.  Did the baby eat it????  Yes he eats it.  It took a few sandwiches before he got used to it, but he will eat it.  We have gone through about 3 of the 6 jars.  Do I ever make myself a Soy butter sandwich....not on your life!  So, for the undiscerning tastes of my 17 month old, he will eat it.  Do I want a sandwich...um No thanks, pass the JIF!

review/text: I don't know if other people have forgotten what peanut butter tastes like, but this does not taste anything like peanut butter. This taste exactly like crushed soy nuts, which is exactly what it is.  Its not a bad product, it has the same consistency as peanut butter and looks like peanut butter, but tastes like soy nuts.  Which, by the way, do not taste like peanuts.  (soy nuts are baked soy beans if you aren't aware) It is a fairly strong soy nut taste, you can taste the soy nut taste even with jam.  I like soy nuts ok, but I think I will go back to almond butter or peanut butter.

The chocolate flavor is actually very good. I was afraid it was going to be "whipped cream with a hint of chocolate and alcohol" but it's really not! It looks like chocolate mousse almost when you serve it and the flavor is just divine. Definitely going to get more of this!

review/summary: The Very Best
review/text: While marketing for healthy breakfast fare,I tripped across this tin of' Mc Cann's, Steel Cut, Oatmeal several years ago and decided to give it a try. I did and now I am all but addicted to it! I followed the directions to have  perfect oatmeal. It was perfect but the drawback was the 25 to 30 minutes to cook it, and to do this daily! I like mine 'al dente' so I fast cook it on high temperature until most of the water has boiled out about 10 minutes, then cover it to simmer it the remainder of the cooking time. However with this method, one has to stir the oatmeal very often while it is simmering. Then along came a friend who suggested that I make a full batch, 1 cup of this oatmeal to 4 cups of water, and put the remainder of what wasn't eaten in a covered bowl in the frig. This I did, and still do. Now I scoop out the amount I want to reheat, place it in a bowl stirring in a little water to loosen it up, microwave it for 2 minutes or less depending on the amount I am reheating, and  I have almost an instant breakfast! Since it so crunchy and so delicious all by itself ( it doesn't even taste like oatmeal!) that it really  does not need any extras!Try it and enjoy!!!

review/summary: The very best
review/text: Oatmeal gets a bad rap these days.<br /><br />Most people have their first experience with the quaker instant oatmeal, loaded with sugar and artificial flavoring, with the consistency of mush. After eating it, you just feel dirty for the next few hours, like you ate candy for breakfast. The rest of their lives, people never go back. John McCanns's oatmeal will convert anyone back.<br /><br />The flavor and consistency is everything you could ask for in a warm breakfast cereal. Once you try it, you can never go back to regular oatmeal. It's chewy and delicious, not like the quaker slime you might remember. Sure, it takes 30 minutes to cook, but after you've done it once, it's easy. I wake up, throw some water on the stove, make my coffee, drink my coffee while I wait for it to boil, throw in the oats, set the dial to 3, give it a stir, and take a shower. When I come out, breakfast is almost ready. I could understand if you don't have the extra time, but this stuff is worth it.<br /><br />The only thing is that this oatmeal is about 5-6 times more expensive than Steel-Cut oatmeal you can buy in bulk at the grocery store. That isn't to say that you can't taste the difference in quality, but at some point, they're both steel-cut oatmeal.<br /><br />So if you want the very best, go with John McCann's. I highly recommend buying a tin if it's your first time trying steel-cut, since it takes a few times to figure out how to cook it and the tin provides instruction. It also looks very cool and gives you a place to put the oats you might buy in bulk later.

review/summary: I too am hooked!
review/text: Saw this product in a local grocery and was lured by the tin can and decided to try it for myself. I must say it does in fact have a nutty taste to it unlike traditional oatmeal. I found myself buying another can just days later only halfway through the first can. I am now a devoted McCann oatmeal lover!

review/summary: What?  All These Folks Are Right?
review/text: I read the nine reviews that preceded me and wondered how a product depending on a person's taste could consistently receive five stars.  Is something suspicious here?<br /><br />Nope!  Here's the tenth five-star rating in a row, and I'm tough.  This is the best sauce of its kind (or any kind) I've ever had; and I'm an old guy who's been around.  Just the right sweetness, just the right hotness.  I'd love to soak a chicken in it, as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets.<br /><br />These big bottles won't last and I'll be back for more, fer shure.  Absolutely more than worth worth the little price, this stuff should be standard in every home, along with plumbing.<br /><br />And my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you.

review/summary: Restaurants should serve this.
review/text: This stuff is good. My mom gave me a bottle to go with some eggrolls and we were hooked upon first dip. The perfect blend between sweet and spicy, this stuff is so yummy that even people who claim to dislike "spicy" or "Asian" or any other kind of exotic fare find it delicious!
