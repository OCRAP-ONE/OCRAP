review/summary: Beware: Has sugar in it!
review/text: This vanilla has sugar in it.  Nowhere in the description does it specify that, but on the ingredient list on the label it does. This isn't the real thing at all, which would explain the price.  Shame on Amazon/seller for not listing all ingredients on this product. I buy from Amazon weekly, and this is the first purchase I've made that's made me feel taken.

review/summary: Good Enough, especially for the Price
review/text: Today I am buying my second bottle of this Kirkland Vanilla Extract, and that alone is a review!<br /><br />While this may not be an absolutely premium product, it is as good as the name brands in teensy, weensy little bottles at the supermarket, and it is drastically less expensive.<br /><br />I have not used this vanilla in baking, only in pudding, and the flavor was perfect. Maybe I am just not fussy. I do know that the teensy, weensy little bottles of Vanilla from the supermarket lasted a whole lot longer because of their cost. I found myself saving them for baked goods or other foods that I made for other people, and, at least in pudding for just myself, I did not use any vanilla to save money. Now I never fail to use vanilla when I want to.

review/text: I've purchased this from Costco when the vanilla I purchased from my cruise in Mexico ran out.  I've always been pleased with the products from the Kirkland Signature Brand but after I used this I poured the whole bottle down the sink.  I guess I've been spoiled after using such a high quality of vanilla and frankly I can never go back to using sub par vanilla in my baking.  But that goes for all vanilla here in the US, so sad we can't have a company that sells superior vanilla here too.

review/text: Planeters apparently has stopped making their Buffalo Wing flavor which was a 10 star flavor on a 5 star scale -- these on the other hand just taste like you took some peanuts and dusted them with chipotle pepper, its not a nice roasted in flavor, its just bland in opinion. I don't find them to be particularly hot or flavorful. Please bring back the Buffalo Wing flavor, that was by far the best tasting peanut ever made -- this is more like shaking salt or pepper on them, extremely disappointing.

review/text: We like chipotle and thought we would give these a try. They exceeded our expectations.These peanuts are very flavorful and yet nicely hot.You get taste first then a snap when the hot kicks into gear. They are hot enough to make your nose run like wasabi but not as hot as say 15 alarm type hot items. My two boys 15 and 9 loved them and were quickly addicted to the one-two punch. Even my twin 6 year old daughters liked them...but they kept their juice handy.<br /> Great for eating alone or to add to other nuts to liven them up.

review/summary: The best Progresso soup I've had so far
review/text: I've tried the majority of the Progresso soups, and this light beef pot roast has been the best one so far. The dominant ingredients include chunks of ground beef, tomatoes, carrots, celery, peas, green beans, and potatoes. The celery and green beans suffer from the never-ending Progresso symptom of being too mushy once warmed up, but the rest of the vegetables have come out perfect the times I've had this soup. The potatoes in particular are the perfect texture and consistency, and the ground beef is a very welcome and tasty alternative to Progresso's usual chicken, which typically dominates their non-vegetarian soups. The flavor is not bland like some and not too strong and has been just right when I've had it. The solid ingredients are plentiful and packed into the can, although I did not experience the same degree of satiation after eating this as I have from other Progresso soups. Because this is a "light" soup and a Weight Watchers item, it's relatively healthy compared to some of the other Progresso soups, having comparably low amounts per serving of Calories (80), sodium (490 mg), and cholesterol (10 mg). Definitely worth trying and as mentioned, a really nice alternative to the other chicken-dominated soups. Check out my picture to see what the soup looks like in the bowl.

But it also goes over well in box style mac n cheese, quick easy and filling. Two 26 0z cans of Campbells soup and one of these feeds my family of 4 on cold or rainy days. Add a can to those boxed chicken dinners that never seem to have enough chicken and you are good to go! Or add to macaroni salad and move it up from a side to a main dish. Lots of uses, long term storage for folks like us who live in storm center Florida. Although these days any part of the country should paractice "stocking up."

review/summary: Best dog food we've found
review/text: With 5 dogs of various breeds, ages, and sizes, it's difficult to find a quality food that meets everydoggy's tastes. With NRG Maxim Buffalo, we have found it! Plates of this food are quickly licked clean!<br /><br />We've tried other dehydrated/raws. HK smells very herby, and no one seemed to like it. Lucy's is apparently tasty, but its appearance will tell you it's mostly dried mashed potato. The ingredients in NRG are recognizably buffalo and veggies. There's a pleasant, fresh aroma upon adding water.<br /><br />For maximum convenience, I immediately portion out the box of food into smaller plastic containers. I suppose they could stay out, but I stack most of the containers in my freezer. I add COLD water to a container and put it in the fridge overnight. Next morning, it's reconstituted and ready to serve after warming up.<br /><br />Pricy? Maybe. But keep in mind that 10 pounds of dehydrated turns into much more after adding water. And the quality of this food is worth the price. I strongly believe that eating should be one of the pleasures of a dog's life. What made us think that it's okay to relegate a dog to a lifetime of eating only dry kibble? Give your canine buddy a plate of this...you'll see how much he enjoys it, and you won't want to go back to kibble!

As it turned out, I preferred the jar to the cubes. Well, next I was out of beef bouillon cubes and ran into the same problem. Same solution too. I bought the 7.9 ounce jar. It's excellent. Just yesterday I made a beef-flavored soup/stew and used the bouillon as a flavoring agent. Everything turned out perfect. This stuff has a real high sodium content, so I eliminated salt as an ingredient. The result was excellent!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I'm sure more people would give them a try if they packaged this in one 30-piece, portable little cardboard box, and sold it as an "add-on" product at Amazon for 2 dollars or something, just so folks could try it out.

However, the local grocery store ran a buy 2 100% juices and get one sparkling 4-pack free. So I gave them a try. Ugh. I love cranberry juice, but this is mostly grape juice and sparkling water with a hint of cranberry juice thrown in. First, I would never buy grape-cranberry juice or cran-grape juice. When you're expecting cranberry juice and get grape juice, it tastes awful. I waited a day and tried another can, thinking that knowing what it was before taking a swig would help. It didn't. This product is gross and leaves a bad after-taste. I can mix my own 70% cranberry juice and sparkling water beverage. I will never buy this product again.

review/summary: marvelous light beverage or cocktail alternative!
review/text: This delectably light combination of fruit juice and selzer water, with no added sugar, is a marvelous alternative to heavy or caffeinated drinks.  Sleekly packaged in a slender 8-oz. flip-top can, it's great to have one in your purse or briefcase to pour over a glass of ice when friends or colleagues are ordering iced tea (all that caffeine!) or a cocktail.  Easy to make your own, of course, but the packaging makes it so incredibly portable and eliminates the problem of storing leftovers if you're away from a fridge.  I confess the ease of use occasionally makes me pop one at home, too.  I appreciate the lack of added sugar, though of course the fruit juice itself is naturally sweet -- but the selzer helps cut it, as does the ice which I strongly recommend you pour it over.  Hard to find in our local grocery store (sells out!!), so it would be wonderful to be able to order in bulk at a reasonable price through Amazon!!

review/summary: Sparkling GRAPE Juice
review/text: When I first tasted this drink, I was expecting to find a taste similar to the cranberry juice I have been drinking for years. I mostly Ocean Spray cranberry juice, which is mixed with other fruit juices but still tastes mainly like cranberry. This drink was disappointing, only because to me it tasted more like bubbly grape juice than anything else. I then looked at the ingredient list. As many may know, ingredients used in the greatest amount are listed first, followed in descending order by those in smaller amounts. The very first ingredient listed was grape juice from concentrate, then sparkling water, and THEN cranberry juice from concentrate. To me, this is just not enough cranberry juice to be calling this product a sparking cranberry drink.<br /><br />The product is still tasty, but is not a true cranberry drink. If you're looking for that cranberry taste you won't find it here.

review/summary: Favorite product that I can never find in stores on the shelf!
review/text: I think the d'Abruzzo form of VitaSpelt pasta tastes better than wheat.<br /><br />Current day genetically modified wheat tastes dirty to me, after years of eating the Vitaspelt.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the regular, more brown whole grain pasta they carry. But being Italian,  pasta is kinda sacred to my tastebuds, ya know. This brand cooks to a perfect al dente texture<br /><br />The Penne is my ultimate favorite, then the angel hair pasta. If I'm lucky I'll see a few left on the grocery store shelf, which we grab up quickly. The next trip there will be none to be found!<br /><br />So being able to buy 12 boxes at once is such a wonderful benefit!  I'll keep my cupboards stocked with these shipments.

review/summary: Historical grain in pasta form
review/text: I ordered this product when my grandson was visiting. He is allergic to most grains including wheat, but spelt is  apparently an exception for some wheat-allergic people.<br />Somehow, I expected it to taste strange, but we all were happily surprised that spelt pasta tastes very much like "regular" pasta. It makes a great side dish with even a simple marinara sauce. Try it, you'll like it.<br />I sent home all the extra boxes with my grandson when he left, so I didn't have to eat the leftover pasta all by  myself for the next 6 months (:D). I did find out it is available locally at Whole Foods , but it is more expensive per box than Amazon.com.

review/summary: Veggie Rawhide -- Dried Sweet Potato
review/text: My dog is allergic to beef, so I needed an alternative to rawhide and tendon chews.  I tried these, and he loves them.  I have not found them to be messy or gummy.  I also love that they are made of real food (sweet potatoes), with no additives or fillers, and that they are made in the U.S. rather than China.  They are not as long-lasting a chew as rawhide or tendons, however.  If you are looking for a longer-term doggie pacifier, my recommendation would be a Zuke's Z-Ridge Edible Dental Chew Bone.

review/summary: Compared to the competition these are the best (My dogs love these!)
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:29 Mins<br /><br /></span>I was purchasing Canyon Creek (and Waggin' Train) yams for my dogs from the pet store.  They loved the taste but I couldn't stand the smell.  The preservative used is a bisulfite (I incorrectly state bisulfate in my review) and it breaks down to sulfur dioxide (one of the smells of burning matches) on standing.  I don't know if they use too much preservative but either way I never liked the thought of so much of it being there.  Although the Canyon Creek came from China I figured how could they screw up yams?  Anyway, I saw these in the store and saw the Made in the USA label and decided to give them a try.  For me they are better in every way, cheaper, no smell, last longer on chewing, better texture, bigger sizes.<br /><br />Some other notes that I forgot to include in the video, they are labeled as vegetable rawhides, they don't last anywhere near as long as a real rawhide.  Maybe a minute for my big dog.  Also some reviewers noted that their dogs either didn't like them or got sick after eating them.  My dogs experience no loose stools or vomiting and they will beg for these treats readily when I go for the bag (obvious in the video when I pull the treat from the bag and he immediately comes up to grab it), but again this depends on the dog.  These treats fit very well with my wish to feed my dogs a quality product whenever price will allow.<br /><br />Edit:  The price on these seems to fluctuate heavily.  When I bought these and wrote the review they were $9.99, that was a good deal for what they are and comparable with the other brands, but at $18.99 a bag I wouldn't really consider them worth it any more and I would buy other treats instead.

So it is a treat that that keeps her occupied for a while and helps her insides to be happier and healthier! The clinic dogs love them as well. As soon as I open up the bag to get one out their noses go straight up and they start sniffing..which leads to begging for one! =) I only give my baby 1 a day, as more than that would exceed her calorie limit for the day, and I think it would lead to loose stools, which no one wants!

review/summary: Excellent Vegetarian Rawhide
review/text: My dog really loves these Sam's Yams Veggie Rawhide Sweet Potato Dog Treats.  She eats one up so fast I kind of think she will choke, but she just really loves the flavor of these treats.  I have purchased some sweet potato treats for my dog before and she really liked them, so I thought I would give these a try for her.  She finds them even more tasty than the ones I had previously purchased.<br /><br />I like that these are vegetarian rather than beef rawhide.  Beef is OK, but I wanted to get her off so many beef items.  These are a good alternative.  The dehydrated sweet potato makes for an analysis of 6% minimum crude protein and 6% minimum crude fat.  Those levels are in the good range for these treats - I don't want them to get much above those amounts.<br /><br />I love my dog, and these premium treats are the perfect way to reward her, and help clean her teeth.

If you have a smaller dog, the Bichon Fries are perfect for you.  2 Paws Up!!

But as my doggie is small only 18 lbs I decided to cut them in half so I emptied the treats on my kitchen table to find TWO LIVE MAGGOTS! I was so grossed out I quickly took the treat away from my doggie and opened another bag and the same thing MORE MAGGOTS! I'm so disappointed please do not buy this product!

review/text: With 5 small dogs who are all on limited diet due to skin issues, finding a treat is a difficult task.  These fit the bill!  They are just hard enough to warrant some good chewing time but will not stain the carpet or leave bad house odors.  The only ONE drawback is just a nature issue....what goes in...must come out.  It does make cleaning the yard much easier since the bright orange sweet potato stands out in the green grass! (too many yams?? LOTS of outside potty time too!) I do like that these are a natural product that my dogs really enjoy.  We use other treats, but giving these once or twice a week works with our treat schedule well.

review/summary: Bear loves non-GMO Sam's Yams!
review/text: My dobe, Bear, has enjoyed Sam's Yams chews, cookies and bones since he was a puppy.  Because Sam's Yams require more focused chewing than typical training treats, the chews, cookies and bones were integral in a training routine to encourage my rambunctious puppy to stay down and calm on our "front porch" as neighbors, kids on bikes and cars moved past.  What began as training has become a ritual which is our favorite part of the day.<br /><br />Recently, at the advice of Bear's vet to address a chronic skin condition, I changed Bear's diet to a single novel protein source and eliminated all GMO ingredients. To that end, I contacted all of the vendors of Bear's treats including, of course, Sam's Yams.  To our delight, Chef David and Sam's Yams sweet potato grower assured us that Sam's Yams do not contain any GMO ingredients.  Happily, Bear's skin condition has resolved and he continues to be one of Sam's Yams greatest fans.

Doesn't take him as long to eat as a rawhide but they're still pretty substantial.

review/summary: This treat gets FOUR PAWS UP = our guys LOVE them!
review/text: (This is the same review I posted for the "Big Boyz" size of this product) ...<br /><br />We have three dogs, and one is a bit of a "picky" eater, and I have given Sam's Yams to ALL of them, with no complaints and wagging tails from everyone. I didn't want to have the mess on the rugs (or smell) of real rawhide, and I didn't want to worry about bone chips with regular bone treats. These are our guys' FAVORITE treat, hands down. To make them last longer overall, you can bend and break them into small pieces (which I always do), and simply give them as a smaller treat, vs. giving them the entire 'slice' of sweet potato as they come packaged in the bag. Even though they don't last for hours like a "rawhide" does, I just don't care. I've had my fill of trying to keep the dogs in one tiled area with their chews / bones so that they don't get crud on the carpet or rugs (that I have to clean!). With this product, you have: (1) a super healthy treat (2) something that doesn't have the risk of bone chips (although of course, I don't give them these treats and leave the house -- and I don't do that with any treat) (3) a treat that does NOT stain the carpet or rugs (at ALL!), or rub off or stain your dog's fur (4) a treat that is made from dried sweet potatoes and ONLY that ... no preservatives, no 'animal parts', no artificial colors, no chemicals, no other "mystery" ingredients that you can't identify - just 100% dried sweet potatoes. I've checked around and Amazon seems to have the best price - I recommend these VERY highly (and I would say that our dogs all agree!)

Well we finished the bag and they both are really warming up to the yams as they haven't had any other chews so I am ordering more bags. So I have revised up from 3 to 4 stars.

review/summary: Very happy puppy
review/text: My dog will not touch regular rawhide or any chewy for that matter, even when it is coated in peanut butter or marinated in steak seasoning. But she's loves these. We wanted her to chew more rawhide to help her teeth and gums. This works!

review/summary: Chihuahua loves them!
review/text: I have been wanting to switch my dog onto a different type of chew treat and have found that vegetables keep her GI tract in good order.  These are made in the USA and she loves them.  I break them into small 1 x 2 inches pieces and give her about 2 a day.  They don't last as long as rawhide, but the fiber is great for her and I have not had to give her doggie Heimlich maneuvers for choking since we made the switch.  We are going try other products from this company too.

review/text: My greyhounds go absolutely bananas for these chews.  I will not give them rawhide, so these are great for their teeth.  They're really hard, and made up of nothing but sweet potato goodness.  Sweet potatoes are rich in vitamins A and C and fiber (among other things), so much healthier anyway.  I buy these all the time!  Can't recommend them highly enough.

review/summary: So good i'd eat them...
review/text: These things are pretty good.  I saw them in the store, bought some there, and then bought some online to save a few bucks... they're kinda pricy, but i tried to make them myself thinking it'd be pretty easy since its just dried yams, and mine didn't come out as chewy, or with the same texture.  My dog will eat it either way, whether i made them or if i buy them, and still love them as much, but it takes a realy long time in the oven, and i can't be bothered to wait. my dog loves these things, but then again, she loves just about anything edible.  oh, also, my product came ontime.

review/summary: Best Chews Ever!
review/text: I can't say enough about this product!  My dog was sick for 6 months last year, and hospitalized twice.  Her food was changed 4 times, before they figured out she was allergic to just about every kind of meat!  What is a dog to do???  There wasn't anything out there that she could chew on (that she liked).  She wouldn't touch non-food toy chews, so she took to finding paper(or a book) and chewing/shredding it whenever she could get away with it.  I was going out of my head!  Sam's Yams was a God-send!  She loves them and can't wait to get one.  She gets so excited when she knows I'm getting one for her, and then can't find a place to chew it...it's funny, she circles the house looking for a good hide-out, afraid someone will take it from her.  The best part is...they aren't making her sick!  I highly recommend these, as well as the Big Boyz version of the chew. My dog is a Cavapoo, size of a Cocker, and it takes her about 5-10 minutes to polish one off.  That is the only downer...wish it lasted longer.  But hey, beggers can't be choosers!!

review/text: I bought these thinking they would be good and healthy for my terrier mix and he would enjoy them.  I was wrong.  After trying for a week, he wanted nothing to do with them. He prefers his Dingo rawhide bones.  I gave one to a friend's dog, a lab, who usually eats absolutely anything and everything, but surprisingly, she, too, after a couple of attempts wanted nothing to do with these.  Then, I gave one to my sister who has a rat terrier to see if he liked them.  At first he didn't, but after a day or so, he now loves them!  He must even like the smell of sweet potato because my sister says he even rolls on them!  So my experience says 1 out of 3 dogs will enjoy these sweet potato treats.

review/summary: Its cheap, but it has too much added flavoring
review/text: No...  I didn't try it myself and my dog loves eating it, but it smells like it has too much flavoring, seasoning and salt added. Smells like canned spam. Its mostly corn and mystery meats, but it has so much stuff added to make the dog like it that they become quite picky afterwards. This stuff is like human fast food. It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff. Now, my dog spits out the all-natural kibble -which I assume he thinks tastes like cardboard after having his taste buds desensitized by all the salt. Kinda like a Pandora's box.<br /><br />The stool is softened soft serve ice cream consistency. After first week when he became accustomed to it, which was more runny.<br /><br />The price is good, but your dog will become more picky with blander foods afterwards.

I have to throw away part of the the shipment and go through the disgust and hassle of cleaning it up.

I posted a comment to the seller about this after the frst shipment and never received a response and the problem keeps happening. SO NOT WORTH IT and I AM VERY UNHAPPY!!!! I am going to the local Walmart to get it there is not much of a difference in price and at least I know I am not getting bugs shipped to my home and having to throw out cans that are damaged. I cancelled my future shipments and DO NOT recommend anyone order this product from Amazon.

review/text: I never knew you could by dog food at Amazon until one day I just happened to bounce upon it.  To my amazement it came right when it was promised and no shipping to top that off was a delight.  My dog is happy too because she never has to wait for her meal like in some days she did when I would run out and have to go to the store.  This just adds a nice portability to fresh dog food and I do mean it came fresh. I have bought this same brand at the store before and it was not fresh plus I paidd a higher price per can.  Boy that was disappointing.  But now I will always order her food this way.  I hope to add the cats food next time.

review/summary: Tempted my 14 year 8 mo old dog to eat!
review/text: I tried some of this on my old guy, an American Staffordshire Terrier that is 14 years, 8 months old. He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )<br />So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.<br />So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!<br />Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.<br />( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )

review/text: I live in Manhattan and i have a beagle (5yr old) n i ordered this food because the economy is bad and i need cheap afforable dog food. People talk about this food as if its garbage so i did my research by a co worker who used to work for pedigree and online. The food is proccess is nasty! but if has all the vitamins and protien needed for all dogs. I checked cans at a pet store and pediagree had more vitamins and more crude protien then science diet n others. I know the food is made bad but it isnt effecting your dog. I recieved the cans unharmed just 1 was a lil bent but it wasnt a biggy n i recieved it fairly quick and my dog loves the food. I recommend this food for low income pet owners.  N pedigree may be bad but feeding your dog people food is even worse. Think about that!. Also Pedigree was the #1 dog food back in the 80S n 90s but since all these new dog food came out and research was done on the food was declared garbage. It still used in shelters.

review/summary: Delicious Meaty Dog Food
review/text: Pedigree  smells delicious.  It is an enticing smell, good enough to make humans turn their noses toward it.  A black lab and a standard poodle in our family agree that it tastes delicious.  The meaty chunks of real beef  in a doggy-tasty gravy pleases the most finicky canines. None of the humans in the family have tried it though.<br /><br />It has all the meat in it that a dog needs for maintenance, and it can be mixed with dry food for extra crunch.  There is the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones, according to the Pedigree people.  It also has omega fatty acids and the essential nutrient for healthy skin and a shiny coat.  The dogs find it highly digestible so that the nutrients are easily absorbed.  (All these features are listed on the Pedigree web page.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!

I was told that the product had been discontinued, so I purchased a substantial amount of both kinds from Amazon & am storing them in my freezer.<br /><br />Both products have been an easy-to-make quickly & very tasty tasty accompaniment to our meals.  I hope Jimmy Dean will realize that they have made a mistake in discontinuing this product, especially since it is the only one in the just-right size.

review/summary: A OK for the Bolivian Flavor I was looking for.
review/text: I was looking for Aji Colorado which is used in Bolivian cooking.  Angelina's advised that this was the closest according to her spice specialists.  It appears to be very, very close to the flavor and scent of the Bolivian spice.  After spending a fortune to get a few small envelopes of Aji from Boliva, I am thrilled to find something very similar for a great price.

review/text: Husband and I are faithful, every-day, instant oatmeal eaters. We've tried pretty much every variety on the market and had settled on Quaker Apple and Cinnamon (or occasionally Maple and Brown Sugar if we were feeling a little wild) until we found Chocolate Chip. It does not have an overwhelming chocolate flavor, but is quite good! It's all we've bought since first trying it nearly a year ago.

review/summary: Why ruin a good breakfast?
review/text: I love their regular instant oatmeal, but I can't say the same for this variation. The Chocolate Chip Instant Quaker Oats taste just sticks in my mouth and can't be ignored. It is plain awful. The reader who said it tastes like burnt chocolate is close. That some claim to like the taste is beyond my comprehension. I've even tried it after removing all the chips before cooking, and it still is horrible, so there must be something in it besides the chips to subvert the flavor. I'll just leave it there, I don't wish to obsess any more over the taste, so I'm off to eat something else to clear it from my mouth.
