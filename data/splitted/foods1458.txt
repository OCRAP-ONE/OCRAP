review/summary: Beef broth extraordinaire
review/text: My family loves a variety of soups, but their favorite is beef & cabbage soup made with leftover pot roast and other fresh vegetables and it's always a problem not having enough beef broth. I have used others but this is absolutely the best. It is low in salt and high in flavor. There is always some in my refrigerator. I use it whenever I need beef flavor. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTI22G">Pacific Natural Foods Beef. 32-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>

review/text: I bought this brand because their chicken stock is awesome, but this was disgusting.  I can't believe it's the same company.  I used this with French onion soup, which should be impossible to taste bad, but it just has a weird flavor.  It's hard to explain.  It doesn't have a rich, beef flavor to say the least.  Not to mention that it smells nasty as well.  I will never buy this again, and if I can't find anything better I will make my own beef stock.

review/summary: Salty Otherwise Bland
review/text: This salmon would be most appealing to those who like a strong salty taste.  Normally, such as taste would also come with a wood fire taste/smell.  Not here: this fish is a combination of heavy salt and a very light smoke.  It comes packaged in a brine and it has a briney flavor to it.  If you like a heavy smoke taste or conversely a fresh fish taste avoid this product.<br /><br />I give it a subjective 1 star.  Some people might like it but I found that the salt taste obscured all else and left a distinctive salty aftertaste.

review/text: Well, we just opened our box for a New Years breakfast.  Not what I expected.  First, there was no wooden box.  Secondly, it was not the typical smoked salmon we are used to.  As stated previously, this is packed in brine liquid.  The fish did not appear to be smoked in either flavor or appearance.  Although it is salmon, it tastes and smells more like a can of tuna.  I give one star only because ZERO is not an option.  I will not purchase this again.

review/summary: apricot kernals
review/text: I have ordered the organic apricot kernels. Proper research and understanding will dispel fears and knee jerk reaction about the cyanide component. Cyanide is used in table salt, fish industry and pesticides. So unwarranted fear is unnecessary. Unless someone eats way too many, it should not affect anyone. More people die of drug overdose such as taking aspirin and acetaminophen and than over consumption of food naturally made for us to consume and possibly heal naturally. Ironically organic also takes care of pesticides problem.

review/summary: Organic Raw Apricot Kernels - review
review/text: Purchased two bags of these - 2 pounds each. It's something like 1500 kernels per bag.  The packaging what very professional looking - sealed fresh. Once opened it has a ziplock press n seal thing to keep the bag closed.<br /><br />My wife and i take these up to 5 per day. Experience has taught us that unless you can handle the very bitter taste of these its best to take with some other form of food. You can also grind these in a coffee grinder which we've done and then sprinkle over salad, pasta or what have you.<br /><br />We came up with a great way to consume these without making you wince over the bitterness - buy a bag (or more) of organic, raw dried apricots (without sulfites or other additives) and take one of these with a kernel and chew it that way. Its like putting the kernel back in the apricot. Makes it a lot easier to eat the kernel if you are eating it whole and taste great that way.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: Apricot kernels do not taste very good, but they contain a supplement known as B17, which has been known to cure cancer.  I gave them to a friend with cancer.  Since she has been eating 7 a day along with taking the supplement in pill form, the doctors cannot find anymore cancer.  She also did 2 chemo sessions during this time, but was not able to finish chemo due to an allergic reaction to it.  This leads me to believe that the rumors are true...  B17 does kill cancer and you can get it through eating apricot kernels.  If the taste is too strong, I would also recommend chopping and mixing into other foods.  The package arrived promptly and in perfect condition.

review/summary: Use with Extreme Caution
review/text: I bought this product because I was told that the seeds contained a compound called amygdalin that could fight cancer and was like laetrile. I was eating about 7 seeds a day and after about 3 weeks my bones were aching and I couldn't get a good breath. After further researching, I found that amygdalin breaks down to cyanide in your system and I was sufferring from cyanide poisoning.  I have been getting steadily better since I discontinued using the seeds. Otherwise, they were fresh and well packaged, so your experience my not be like mine, but when fighting cancer you have to pick your poison apparently.

review/summary: Raw?  Really?
review/text: I had been using raw apricot seeds from another source for years, but when I found this product at this price (about 1/2 the price I was paying) I couldn't resist.  Immediately I noticed a brittle, crunchy texture like they were toasted or freeze-dried (both of which will destroy the B17).  The package clearly states "raw", which I suppose, however deceptively, does not exclude freeze-drying.  And after  popping the usual 7 kernels in my mouth, I braced myself for the wave of bitterness.  It never came.<br />Too bad I ordered 2 packages.  I am using 9-10 instead of 7 until these are gone.  I am too suspicious to reorder.

review/summary: Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor
review/text: My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.

review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT
review/text: I have a VERY picky 9.5 yr old German Shepherd that leaves anything but a milkbone on the floor to collect dust.  She LOVED this bone!!!  I was amazed to see her crunch it up the large bone so quickly!  She's always been very well disciplined until these bones arrived at least.  She went into my pantry and tore the bag open and ate 7 bones!!!  She had such a low hung head when I approached her about the issue all I could do was laugh!!!  Luckily, my 4 month old shephard got one before her sister ate the batch!)  I save about $5 ordering the bones on Amazon.

review/summary: Ithing and chewing on paws
review/text: I first purchased a pack of Nutri Dent puppy chews for my Welsh Terrier when he was just a few months old. He LOVED them and they kept him busy for a while. Around the same time, he started itching and chewing on his paws incessantly and would not stop, even for a treat. Initially we thought it was the flee protection, then the shampoo, then the treats, then the peanut butter and lastly these. We continually phased each of the previous items out of his diet/lifestyle until finally we determined that the itching and scratching was related to these. We've obviously stopped giving these to him and now he rarely scratches or chews on himself. Your dog may have a different reaction to them but if he's experienceing any of the above symptoms, it may be related to these.

Since I couldn't find them at Costco the past couple of times I went there, I searched online and found them on Amazon.  Funny...after I ordered them I now see them at my local grocery store chain (Ralph's)...and even on the flight I took across the country last month (United Airlines).  However, I'm still glad I ordered a big box of them because we go through them pretty fast.  :)

review/summary: OMG!!!!  Solves that craving!!
review/text: Oh, YUMMM!!<br />These are THE best chips I have tasted in years.  I am allergic to lactose, gluten, soy, mint and grapes, which has made it hard to go through these past several years craving soda crackers or something akin to them, and even trying (unsuccessfully) to come up with a workable recipe I can make for myself.  Now I have found them!  These are my newest comfort food.  Wonderful with a chilled glass of Diamond Almond Milk, and I am that little kid back in the kitchen sitting with my milk and crackers.  The texture and tender-crisp "bite-factor" (to me) is so close to that of good, old fashioned crackers - - and the flavor is just deeply satisfying.  I will be up in the middle of the night snacking on these for sure.  I cannot rave enough about them, but I see that others agree with me in the quality and "yummy-ness" quotient of these wonderful chips!  To me they taste closer to crackers than tortilla chips and that is SOOOO yummy!<br />Thank you AMZ for putting these on S&S!!!  Come next payday I will need to be getting a whole case, maybe 2!!

review/text: My two year old son and I have Celiac Disease. We can't have gluten, because it makes us very sick. We also both happen to have issues with dairy too. It is very nice that there are AFFORDABLE, delicious snacks like this that we can eat and enjoy. My son loves them, and so do I. The multi-grain are the only flavor we have tried, and we are sold! They are so good. I am so happy to have found these!<br /><br />Most gluten free food is very expensive. Like, Betty Crocker's (albeit delicious) gluten free chocolate cake mix is $3.50 a box, and you get half the amount of a regular Betty Crocker cake mix at 98 cents! It is nice when I find great products that taste good and are inexpensive that we can eat. I am so happy that more companies are finally making gluten free foods!

review/summary: Good. Different. Not too strong. Could maybe be stronger.
review/text: I'm a pros and cons gal. I tasted these chips expecting a basic tortilla chip with a hint of flavor, which is what I am used to tasting. The flavor was stronger than subtle and the chips were utlra-fresh tasting. Straight up, here's the pros and cons:<br />PROS: Super fresh. Nice portion size, especially because you'll want more than one portion. Attractive on a plate, unlike traditional tortilla chips. Good amount of flavoring. Light, not greasy. Chips were sturdy and didn't crumble in the bag easily. No pile of "chip-lets" at the bottom. Would probably be a nice surprise in someone's lunch box or at a movie party or summer get-together.<br /><br />CONS: Probably not great for dipping. If you're an olive lover, you may prefer the flavor to be more potent, as I did. If you're concerned about packaging waste, there's a lot of extra bag here which seems wasteful.<br /><br />I personally felt the olive flavor could have been stronger, so I withheld one star, but that is my personal taste. Several people felt it was strong enough. They are definitely worth trying.

review/summary: Average Chip...
review/text: Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly "olive" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of "crunch".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip. I'm much more likely to purchase the better known simple brands carried by my local grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty & healthier substitute for junk-food chips
review/text: Are you the type of person that always needs a side bag of chips to accompany their lunchtime sandwich but then feels pangs of guilt afterward for consuming  that extra 120-200 trans-fat laden empty calories?  If so, FoodShouldTasteGood's line of nutritious tortilla chips strikes an effective balance between satisfying your junk food cravings while providing some nutritional benefit by way of high quality ingredients and a few grams of fiber to boot.<br /><br />The most important factor though is that with their 'Olive' line of tortilla chips (think of a white corn tortilla chip with flavor profiles of black and green olives and a hit of garlic) the taste itself is good enough to convince the staunchest junk-food addicts to reach into that bag for yet another bite.  These chips go well with everything from sandwiches to soups as well as served plain by itself.  These chips are tasty enough with the right crisp texture you've come to know and expect from your standard snack tortilla morsel.  Great product all around.

review/summary: Interesting twist on tortilla chips
review/text: Olives and tortilla chips...who ever though such a combo would be so good? No trans fats, not overly salty, nothing artifical (like the label says...) makes for something a bit different that your typical tortilla chip.<br /><br />You don't need any salsa or cheese on top of them -- the flavor is perfect (if you like the taste of green olives, that is.) You'll be asking for more as the 1 oz. bag will not be enough!

review/summary: they are good and natural
review/text: these are very good tasting and I like that they are all natural no artificial anything. They are more like a tortilla chip. I thought they had a tiny bit of an off flavor and just a bit too much salt but they are good and if you are looking for a natural snack then this would be great with dips.

review/summary: Tasty and Wholesome
review/text: When looking for snack products, I tend to look for those with the fewest artificial ingredients or no artificial ingredients, if possible.  On this count, chips from Food Should Taste Good easily qualify.  All the ingredients are pronounceable and identifiable (quinoa, pronounced keen-wa, is a South American grain).  I have now tried three of the seven flavors, Chocolate, Sweet Potato, and Multigrain, and they all, well, taste good as the brand name implies they should.  The Multigrain chips have a wholesome nuttiness that would go well with a variety of dips (although I'm eating them plain).<br /><br />Best of all, they're kosher, gluten-free, and vegan.  How can one go wrong?

review/summary: Very good tortilla chips
review/text: The taste of these is right between Tostitos Multigrain chips and Original Sun Chips, and that's pretty nice place to be. A little sweeter corn flavor then the Tostitos, but not as much as the Sun Chips.<br /><br />They company/brand/motto of FoodShouldTasteGood lives up to its promise. Even though tastes vary greatly I think most people who like tortilla chips or even thin crackers like Wheat Thins will find these very enjoyable.<br /><br />One thing I thought was funny was that the mini bag seems to be just a scaled down version of the large bag since the picture which they claim is "Enlarged to show texture and detail" is really a bit smaller than actual size (which is about a 2" x 1.5" hexagon).

Love the very subtle hint of garlic but I just don't quite notice the taste of olives. I don't buy the same chips every time I go to stores,  but this is good enough that I will certainly pick up a bag from time to time.

review/summary: Delish!
review/text: These were absolutely delicious.  They came very nicely packaged, with a thick and smooth exterior plastic packaging.  I was a little disappointed that the package was mainly air- there were only about 15 chips in the 1 oz. bag.  However, each chip was delicious and wholesome.<br /><br />They were perfectly seasoned- not too salty, but just enough to bring out the flavor.  The sesame and flax seeds were very evident, and a nice addition.  The ingredients list the chips as being partially made from corn, but frankly, they tasted mainly like whole wheat.<br /><br />I ate them plain, and they were excellent.  I think eating them with salsa would be a waste!

review/summary: Tasty chips
review/text: I love tortilla chips, just good ol' fashioned corn chips with salt on them.  I was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare.<br /><br />Before even tasting these chips, the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness.  It's tough and a little slippery; I almost couldn't open it by hand.  The chips are little hexagons about 1" in diameter, with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips.  While the corn flavor is dominant, the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor.  They're not overly salty - indeed, if I had any quibble, it's that a little more salt would be appreciated.<br /><br />These chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party, a date, or just an evening when you want to treat yourself.

review/summary: Pretty tasty chips with no weird ingredients
review/text: These multigrain chips are more like those vegetable/organic/seed crackers than a tortilla chip.  It does taste a bit like a tortilla chip, but most of the flavor comes from the seeds in it.  I don't think they're too salty and the flavor is pretty well balanced.  The thickness and crunchiness is comparable to that of a Wheat Thin.  I only had one chip broken in half in the last bag that I ate.<br /><br />The ingredients list is pretty interesting in that there aren't any long chemical names: stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flour, flax seeds, turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.  Take a look at the gallery above for a picture of the back of the bag.<br /><br />Each bag is 140 calories and contains 7 grams of fat so they make a pretty good snack.

review/text: If you're like me and have a lot of allergies to different foods and preservatives, this is a great find.  I pulled the chips out and thought they were going to be just a bland chip, but they are very tasty...not too spicy or too strongly flavored either - just right.  I like the thin texture too and at less than a buck a bag, not too pricey as products like these tend to be.

review/text: This product is a perfect size for a lunch-box or a quick snack.  I find it to be hearty and quite filling.  The whole grains are entirely satisfying and work well with most traditional accompaniments for chips.  They are a nice break from the same-old corn chips and all of my guests who have tasted this product find them to be tasty and interesting.  Many have gone on to buy and enjoy this product themselves.  Just like the olive-flavored chips, virtually all the chips are whole and unbroken, which is a nice change of pace from what one gets with most similar products.

review/summary: Tasty, goes well with most dips
review/text: These chips are a nice break from the carbon copy corn-chips that we are all used to.  They have a nice, but not overwhelming, flavor of olive that is really quite delightful and that even people who dislike olives might enjoy.  They go well with guacamole, salsa, one of my favorite spinach dips, vegetable pate and just about any other dip that one might care to eat with it.  They have a hearty taste and texture that is quite satisfying and almost all the chips are whole.  The size is right for a lunch.  Frankly, I cannot imagine anybody not finding these chips enjoyable.<br /><br />I suppose that the only caveat is that if you specifically want the same-old corn chip, then this is probably not for you.

review/text: ...but I guess a little more like a tortilla chip.  I found these tasty and satisying, not quite as salty as the grocery store type tortilla and corn chips (a plus for me).  I didn't taste anything that hinted of olives, though.  Devotees of all-natural foods might be attracted by the lack of GMO ingredients, artificial colors/flavors, preservatives, etc. - that's not a selling point for me, though.  At my age I need all the preservatives I can get!

review/summary: Great taste,all natural ingredients,"iffy" texture
review/text: I'm always in search for good, healthy, whole grain products. When I saw these chips, I jumped at the chance to try something new.<br /><br />The ingredients are superb: it has a corn base, uses non-hydrogenated canola oil, brown rice flour, Turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, flax seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, Quinoa and sea salt. They are not overly salty like most other tortilla chips, which is a nice surprise.<br /><br />They are hearty chips and hold salsa well without breaking. They have a very good taste - corn, nutty, slight hint of salt, and hearty.<br /><br />My main complaint is with the texture. They're crunchy, but have too much of a cardboard texture for my liking.<br /><br />Overall, they're deliciously healthy chips, if you can get past the texture.

review/summary: Crackertilla
review/text: CRACKERTILLA is a word I came up with because this snack is both a thin, round cracker and tortilla chip all in one.  It is light, crispy, and quite tasty. We strongly sense the company really believes that, "Food Should Taste Good."<br /><br />Although we were skeptical at first, the unique olive flavor attracted us to this product. In addition, there are NO artificial colors, flavors, or GMOs in the ingredients.<br /><br />After opening the bag, we observed an attractive sight and scent and . This product is not like average chips, it has the aroma of real-food. The taste is also unlike any other, not only because of the olive flavor, but because of the marriage between the cracker and tortilla chip. The crispness is just right, and the Olive flavor is included without dominating other ingredients. The one-ounce serving size is just right and allows one to easily travel or pack this with a lunch.<br /><br />Overall, this healthy snack is recommended for both kids and adults.

review/summary: Good snack
review/text: I've tried 2 types of FoodShouldTasteGood chips - the Multigrain and these. I must say, I'm impressed with both. Most snack foods go out of their way to hit you over the head with their flavors. Not so here. The tastes are subtle and interesting. Gourmet snacks, if you like.<br /><br />In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Olive and Garlic. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, "No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors". 10% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost. But a few words must be devoted to their monetary price. For about 18 bucks you'll get 24 ounces of these - about 75 cents per ounce. Last week, I bought a 17.5 ounce bag of Ruffles for $3.49 - about 20 cents per ounce. That's quite a differential. Whether you're willing to shell out the extra cash for a non-essential snack will depend on your tastes, your priorities and your pocketbook.

review/summary: An All Natural Winner
review/text: Though I like to try and use all natural foods, I will not sacrifice flavor just to "go natural". From the 1st mini-chip to the last in one of the 1 oz snack-sized bags, I was entirely satisfied and will definitely buy these. I started eating the chips plain and, from the 1st bite, found the multigrain flavor satisfingly strong with a just a hint of sweetness that took the edge off the grain flavor. The size and shape of the chips (more like crackers than larger tortilla chips) was good for snacking, plus the thickness provided just the right texture and "crunch" factor.<br /><br />Later I finished the chips with a pesto dip and the complementary flavors worked perfectly: the chip didn't over power the dip, but neither did it roll over and die. I am sure I would enjoy these tortilla chips with other dips.<br /><br />Finally a last observation is how well these mini-chips kept their original shape. Out of the entire (albeit small) bag, only 1-2 chips were broken.<br /><br />An all natural winner that will have a permanent spot on my households snack-food roster.

review/text: The added grains make these a better choice than the usual chips. They have the same sugar, salt and oil so there are better food snack choices out there, if you care about your health. If they had been made with organic ingredients I might have given them another star. I doubt I would ever purchase this item. Snacks like this are expensive and with food prices going up it has to be really special to make it into the cart.

review/text: Olive Tortilla chips, who would have thought? These chips have a Mediterranean attitude. You can taste the olives but not overwhelmingly. They are great with the usual salsa and sour cream just like any other tortilla chips but these you can try more exotic things like an Italian salsa (tomatos and Italian dressing).<br /><br />Other serious reasons to buy these chips:<br />-No GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms; Basically you get all the plant chemistries God intended for your health, not the Monsanto Corporation.)<br />-Kosher Certified by the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations (For those who care about a holistic diet and raise everything to a spiritual level.)<br />-Certified Gluten-Free (I'm not sure who certifies this.)<br />-No Artificial Colors or Flavors<br />-No Preservatives (Except Sea Salt of course, 80mg per ounce.)<br />-No Cholesterol or Trans Fats

I first tried this companies products from Costco where I purchased their multi grain chips. I was hooked from the first bite and like them even better then the olive ones but they are both excellent chips. They are not too salty either which is another reason I love them. The grainy taste is nutty and a little sweet and addictive. The little bags were not enough I was left wanting more but on the other hand the little bags are safer to have around! You will love these I promise!

review/summary: Excellent, natural chip
review/text: You won't find any MSG, hydrogenated oils, or various things that most people can't pronounce and have no idea what it actually is in these chips.  What you WILL find, however, is a very flavorful chip that has enough flavor for eating plain, but not too much flavor for dipping.<br /><br />While I couldn't really taste a true "olive" flavor, I think that the olives mixed with the garlic salt provides a very subtle flavor that is more robust than plain salted chips.  Of course, not having an overpowering flavor is a good thing...<br /><br />Texture is important with the foods I eat, and these had a nice firm crispness to them.  Other various natural tortilla chips I've tried (including "store brand" Whole Foods chips) have an off-texture (not quite crisp, not quite stale) that have prevented me from repeated buys.  Not the case with these ones.

review/summary: you can actually taste the olives . .very unique
review/text: I like these chips just a bit better than I liked the multigrain version.  The flavor here is unique in that you can actually taste the green and black olives - I think they hit just the right balance here, as well, not too much, not too little.  Salt level is good - I don't care for overly salty chips so these are good for me.  Very textured and multi-level flavor in that you can taste the individual ingredients.  I think they'd go well with a mild guacamole or a smooth cheese and some fruit; nothing should compete with the flavor of these chips.
