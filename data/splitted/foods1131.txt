review/summary: My dog likes them and they like her!
review/text: My greyhound seems to like these a lot, and they don't give her loose stool (which plenty of things do).  Great healthy ingredients -- besides being grain free which is all I'll buy, I love the lack of additives or dubious ingredients.  This will be a repeater for me -- well it is already, as I got my first batch at a fancy pet food store I was visiting and came to Amazon to get more (for much less!).

review/summary: Amazing - But get the companion book!
review/text: This is a wonderful set.  It was originally created as a supplement to the book Ajanta - Regional Feasts of India by the author (who runs a lovely Indian restaurant in Berkeley, CA) Lachu Moorjani.<br /><br />There are 30 separately packed spices proportionate to their probably use.  I love it because I didn't have to purchase each spice, which is often quite expensive, especially when shipping and handling are added.<br /><br />The spices are:<br />Ajwain<br />Asafetida<br />Black Mustard Seeds<br />Black Cumin Seeds<br />Black Salt Powder<br />Cardamom Powder & Pods<br />Cinnamon Sticks<br />Cloves<br />Coriander Powder & Seeds<br />Cumin Powder & Seeds<br />Chile Pepper Flakes<br />Whole Red Chile Peppers<br />Chile Pepper Powder - Hot<br />Garam Masala<br />Dried Pomegranate Powder & Seeds<br />Dried Fenugreek Herb & Seeds<br />Fennel (Anise) Powder & Seeds<br />Mango Powder<br />Nigella Seeds<br />Paprika<br />Tamarind<br />Tumeric (sic)<br />White Pepper Powder<br />White Poppy Seeds<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1586857770">Ajanta: Regional Feasts of India</a>

review/summary: A box full of Surprises!
review/text: I just received the spice box and I can say without reservation that I am 100% satisfied. Everything one needs for a good Indian dish is in the spice box. It is a good starting point for somebody who is just starting out in Indian cooking, such as myself. If one was to buy spices one by one it would be expensive and like this you get everything you need for just a few dollars. Everything comes neatly packaged and labeled so that you don't mistake your curry from your garam masala and so on. Be warned, however, the spice box has a very powerful smell so much so that I had to contain my in a plastic bag and tie it because the smell of 30 different spices together was overpowering my small kitchen. Once in the bag the smell dissipated. Enjoy cooking!

I am dabbling in Indian cooking and other cuisines and can't find all the spices I need in the supermarket, and when I do they are SOOO expensive.<br />This comes with 30 spices... not huge quantities, but much more than I will need for a long time.<br />It really is a treasure chest of spices... and very reasonable when you figure what it would cost to amass these different spices separately.  I HIGHLY recommend!

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: I am an experienced cook but new to Indian, so this spice box was the best way for me to jump in and test the waters.  This was out of stock at the time I wanted it, so I contacted the Ajanta site directly and spoke to the owner and author of the accompanying cookbook (who signed my book) at their west coast CA restaurant--and it was shipped promptly the next day and I rec'd it two days later...mind you, I am on the east coast, in NY. I couldn't have been more pleased with the speedy delivery.  I was impressed with the spice box too.  Everything was in its place, and the top of the lid is 'mapped' out in alphabetical order, just like a box of chocolates, so you can quickly find the specific spice you want--a veritable file cabinet of spices.  Someone else mentioned that theirs arrived all jumbled up, so I have to assume that it got that way in shipping.  Mine was pristine and thoroughly organized, with a gold sticker sealing it down, lovely enough to 'gift.'  Having all spices in front of you to see, touch, and smell is easier to learn about too, better than just seeing illustrations in a book.  All in all, as a beginner of Indian cooking, this was an economical and practical way to try almost 100% of the necessary spices needed for ANY cookbook of Indian cuisine. I highly recommend it.

The spices are so fragrant - sometimes I'll open the box just to take a quick whiff.  It has been so wonderful to buy this and explore indian cooking.  I did not buy the accompanying cookbook.  I am using several popular ones that I checked out of the library.  I bought this and paid $7.99 S&H.  It came 2 days later, and the postage paid was over $12.  I have absolutely no complaints and would recommend this to anyone and everyone!!

Perfectly packaged for me to try out a couple recipes and then I can see what I actually need to get from the store.

review/text: I am new to Indian cooking and came across this spice box.  I received it in 4 days.  I started using the spices immediately because I was so excited.  My first dish was yellow Basmati rice .  It was sooooo good!  I mean if you go by the recipe for the proper amount of spices, then your dishes will be a winner! BUT, most of all these spices are sooo FRESH, and I think they gave a generous amount to use for each of the spices too.  I hope they make future spice boxes to include saffron.  Just a tad bit because I do not want the price to go up too much...lol.  I am very pleased with this spice box.  It is really going to simplify things like taking trips all over the place just to find one spice.  My next dish will be Chicken Korma.  Listen, this spice box is well worth it....get it and ENJOY!

review/text: Aside from being a nostalgicly great treat, they have no high-fructose corn syrup and are small enough for little hands.  We use these at our house for treats after helping clean up the playroom, and for rewards when working with our 1 and 3 year old in the swimming pool for swimming lessons.  The subscribe and save price is the best I've found - with 100 options to buy sweedish fish on amazon, this worked out the best for us.  The red flavor is the same it has been for years, and my personal favorite.  We tried the mixed flavors/colors, but they were just like other candy flavors, nothing special like the red ones :)  They arrived soft and fresh, with a far distant expiration date.  We are on our second box now, and appreciate the high quality.<br /><br />Lu

review/text: Just as the previous review, I found this item at whole foods.  I have two dogs a Shih Tzu and a Terrier Mix.  My Shih Tzu does not like the taste and spits it back out but my terrier mix likes it (but he likes everything).  If the taste would improve they would get the 5 stars.  Before giving my terrier this vitimin he used to shed a lot.  I would have to sweep my house daily and that was still not enough.  After a month feeding my terrier the vitimins the shedding has completely minimized.  My terrier would shed all year round and now no more shedding.  I am so happy I have found this product.  As for my Shih Tzu he has always suffered from allegies with this vitimin he doesn't chew his paws anymore.  I highly recommend this product for dogs with skin and shedding problems.

review/summary: Miracle Supplement for Dogs
review/text: I have two 4 month old English Creme Retrievers that are litter mates.  One of the two had loose stool from the time I picked him up.  We tried dewormer, anti-biotics, yogurt, etc, and nothing worked.  The other was fine though he wasn't particularly regular leading to a few accidents in the house.  I have been looking for something that could help them both and was running out of ideas.  Then one day I was in Whole Foods and noticed Greendog Naturals Whole Dog Daily Chewables on the shelf and decided to give them a whirl.<br /><br />Within a few days I witnessed a really amazing transformation.  My first puppy with the loose stool was feeling fine for the first time in two months!  His intestinal problems had vanished.  The second puppy is now as regular as a Swiss clock.  In fact they are both incredibly regular which makes potty time a breeze now - two dogs, one bag :)<br /><br />My only criticism is that neither of my puppies like the taste. If I try to give it to them directly one will always spit it out (and he is the billy goat of the two). I have to bury it in their food and then it doesn't seem to be a problem at all. While I could have shaved a star off the benefits far outweigh the less than stellar taste.

Probiotics is important to me, as she has been on antibiotics for quite awhile. (Antibiotics kill the beneficial tummy bugs, so I was looking for a product to help replace them.) My dog is doing better and better everyday, and I am more confident that she is getting the nutrition she needs. PLUS, she LIKES them!! For my finicky, food-disliking dog, this is FABULOUS!

review/summary: Small and hard - not like greenies
review/text: The mini chews are SMALL. I was surprised at how small they were, but since we have a 4lb morkie pup, I figured they'd be safe for him to eat under supervision.<br /><br />I expected a generic greenie, but these are much harder and don't have that twizzler type texture that the greenies seem to have. These are a lot cheaper than greenies, so the price is reasonable, especially if you use subscribe and save.<br /><br />My dog seems to like them, but again, because of the teeny size, I wouldn't leave him unattended while eating these for fear he might choke.<br /><br />8/27/2012 UPDATE<br /><br />I've since upped my rating to 4 stars since my dog is now older and REALLY REALLY LOVES these! The vet has told us that they keep plaque from building up on his teeth, so I am diligent about giving him one after each meal. I wish they lasted long. He can finish one in a few seconds, but that's ok. Also, have found these to be a lot cheaper at Petsmart and am able to get twice the amount for the same price as amazon.

review/text: My two maltese and I really like these treats. They both have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents has gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these minichews, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium sized ones after some trial and error. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. I like the smell- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. I like that they have actual ingredients that are "dental" and aren't just calling them a dental treat because of chewing action. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste. The only negatives I have are that these are relatively pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.

review/text: Our dogs love these dental chews and it makes us feel better that the chews take good care of their teeth, unlike some "treats".<br />These are perfectly sized for dogs under 9 pounds, and the "small" size of the same product would be better for dogs 9-20 pounds in size. These do seem to help keep the "doggie breath" problem to a minimum.

review/text: These are easily the best prepackaged kalamata olives I have ever eaten.  All other brands I've tried are packed with vinegar, which gives the olives an unpleasant sourness and masks the olives' splendid complexity of flavour.  For years we bought these at Trader Joe's stores, but since they have switched to another supplier for their store-branded kalamata olives (yes, packed in the ubiquitous vinegar solution) I am very happy to be able to purchase these online.  Delicious for your relish trays or to snack on anytime, or cut and added to your favorite pasta, foccaccia, salad, or other preparation, the Martini brined kalamatas can't be beat.

review/summary: Yummy treat for pumpkin lovers!
review/text: This Pumpkin Quick Bread mix is terrific for breads or muffins on short notice.  Great for a snack at home or to carry along in the car.  The muffins are about $.20 apiece as opposed to whatever you pay out in the world at shops that sell muffins.  Bread bakes in under an hour; muffins are less than 30 minutes.  Nice to keep on hand for welcoming new neighbors, taking a quick treat to the office, or for packing in lunches for school.  We always have this and the banana bread on hand.  Two thumbs up!  Even novice cooks or children can make these.  Enjoy!

review/text: My husband and I are HUGE fans of salt and vinegar chips, so I was very interested to try the Madhouse Munchies variety when I came across the brand in the natural foods section of my grocery store.  I was a little skeptical at first because some natural food chips are super greasy.  Boy was I wrong this time!  Madhouse Munchies are crunchy and flavorful but don't leave behind a greasy mess.  We take the Sea Salt & Vinegar chips with us to every cookout and tailgate party and they are always a big hit!  We always leave the parties empty handed!!

review/summary: First 2-3 deliveries were great.  Last 2 ... not so much
review/text: Decided to try Madhouse Munchies based on the description and the positive reviews.  No ... the opinion of an Olympic skier made no difference whatsoever except to wonder who out there actually believed that an an olympic skier is a more qualified determiner of potato chip quality than anyone else.  Anyway - my first delivery showed these to be good chips.  5 star ... or nearly so.  Second delivery supported the first.<br /><br />I'll give it three stars an an average.  Chips, when well made and fresh are probably closer to 5 stars.  I can't quite recall where it turned but it was either the third or fourth delivery.  This next delivery showed up with the box itself soaked with oil and every single bag within the box slit down the back seam.  It should have been nearly impossible for the person packing it not to notice and its difficult for me to believe that 12 bags spontaneously burst down the back seam in transit.  I reported it, threw them all out and Amazon refunded the money (thanks Amazon).  Next delivery, while not split down the seam, were very very greasy.  The chips were practically dripping oil.  Most recent delivery ... same thing.  I'll chalk the split seam issue down to logistics but the last two scream of manufacturing process changes or cutbacks or simply a malaise in the process.  Whatever it is ... that's all it really takes to lose a customer.  Lay's makes an excellent kettle chip, best I've had to date, and they sell it at the local small market where we pickup our milk for $2.29 for an 8.5oz bag.  That's a better price per oz than I was getting here.  I'm off the Madhouse Munchies bandwagon.<br />Giving this 3 stars as an average but this chip has been on a 5 star to 1 star slide.  Clearly they know how to make a good chip.  For whatever reason they just stopped doing it.

review/summary: The ULTIMATE chip!
review/text: I was first introduced to Madhouse Munchies on a visit to Vermont. After the trip, when the cravings started to hit, I went online and have been buying them online ever since. Braving the abuse of friends who frown on an online potato chip habit, I now find myself eating them alone (even before 5 o'clock!) and hiding them all over the place in case I need a nibble or two to get me through the day. I am always afraid of being found out, and work to hide my obvious potato breath. I know the ads say to munch responsibly, but I will admit that I am an addict (step #1, obviously). To all of you whom I have hurt, I'm sorry. But forget rehab: I will continue to let the chips fall where they may.

review/summary: I have only tried the BBQ flavor but...
review/text: ...they are not so good in my opinion. Described on the bag as light and crisp, they are anything but. These are thick chips made double thick by all the flavorings which is just so over-done, it is falling off into the bottom of the bag. You get about 6 actual chips with loads of orange flavor dust in the bottom of the bag, and it's not the kind that you can dump into your mouth at the end, it is sooooo salty. I bought these for vending (1 oz size) because the Kettle Brand BBQ (which IS good btw) has never come back in stock since I purchased them this past summer. The price is not bad on the madhouse chips but now I have way too many that I will not be able to sell very well (72 pack).<br />I'll probably end up giving them away.

review/summary: These are the best chips ever!
review/text: I am gonna keep this short and sweet. As a long time fan of all chips that are salt & vinegar, I have to say I found my one. Not too salty or pungent with vinegar, but just the right amount of flavor and crispiness. I am so glad I decided to try a box of these. You guys have a winner here.

review/summary: The perfect potato chips.
review/text: I discovered these chips for the first time while vacationing with my wife in New Hampshire last fall.  Wherever I travel, I'm in search of excellent potato chips, and these clearly rank with the best I've ever eaten.  Taste wise, these chips have the right balance between the natural potato flavor and the French onion flavoring, with just the right "crunch."  And what truly amazed me was how such a great tasting chip could have so many natural nutrients and so few calories per ounce.  When we returned to Ohio, I ordered a whole box of the 5-ounce bags to give to friends and relatives this Christmas.

review/summary: Extremely disappointing - chips were made in 2007 and the oil in them was rancid
review/text: I am very disappointed with this purchase.  I don't think it is the product itself but rather how old the chips were that were shipped to me.  The first bag I opened were pretty good and I was feeling happy with my purchase. However, when I went to eat another bag I opened it and it had a very strong smell of rancid oil that dominated any salt and vinegar smell or flavor.  I then opened 2 more bags and they had the exact same issue.  Chips in these bags were essentially non-edible or at least not in<br />anyway pleasant to eat.  Rancid oil can't be a good thing to consume.  Looking closely at the chips sent to me I saw they were manufactured in 2007 and have an expiration date of January 2011 - clearly they have already expired.  This item is not returnable so I will be throwing all of the remaining bags of chips out.  That means I will have spent almost $42 for one good 1-ounce bag of chips.  So if you are thinking of buying such an item on amazon first inquire about how old the product is that will be shipped to you - I will definitely be doing that in the future.

review/summary: Mad Munchies Sea Salted Potato Chips
review/text: My grandson has multiple allergies to all the grains except rice (plus nuts, garlic, etc).  When I discovered these potato chips on amazon.com, I was thrilled.  Only three ingredients, none of which he was allergic to.  I've been purchasing them ever since.  Try reading the ingredients list on other chips to see what I mean about ingredients!  Anyway, he's happy to take them with his lunch to school.  He can eat potato chips too.  And they are VERY good.  Thank you Mad Munchies and amazon.com.

review/summary: Yummy chips... but not all that different.
review/text: These chips are very good.  Crunchy and tasty. Just the right amount of salt. Yet, I really don't see much of a difference as far as the chip being any healthier or a lot more tasty than other kettle chips. They leave your fingers very greasy. (I guess all kettle chips do that though). The bottom of every bag was full of broken, greasy pieces of chip. Maybe my shipment just got banged around too much. They DO taste good and it is hard to put them down.  I finish off a bag every time I open one. (I am not a big eater either) I try to eat a sandwich with them as to not polish off a whole bag at one setting:)Overall, I would try these again.

review/text: These chips did have a terrific bite but still a bit on the greasy side but that's what Kettle chips are. My all time favorite is the Lays salt/vinegar but no longer in the stores where I reside and the company on amazon that sells them only has the 1.5oz (too small) and by the time you pay shipping...not worth it. Overall the Madhouse Munchies not bad and the 5oz size is quite lg. There was a promotional special when I ordered so got the case at a great price on Amazon.

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: I bought these for our office and they are extremely tasty.  Their only drawback is price.  Even with the sale I got them on, they cost nearly twice as much as the "normal" brands for half as much product.  However, they are still quick to be bought by the staff because they taste so darn good.<br /><br />If they would only make 2 oz. bags for the same price!<br /><br />One last thought:  I live in the Rocky Mountains and the shipping went over the passes in Colorado.  Some of the bags lost their air and became vacuum packed as they came back down.  The chips were OK, but the bags looked like they had nearly nothing in them!  This is the case for many air packed and sealed items I buy East of the Rockies.

review/summary: Great Chips
review/text: I consider myself somewhat of a potato chip expert having indulged my craving for over 55 years.  I first discovered Madhouse Munchies Sea Salted chips during a two year stay in Vermont close to where they're made.  I missed that lightly salted flavor when I moved back home.  It was a pleasant surprise to find them at Amazon.  If you like potato chips with a crunch, that aren't so thin they have no substance and with just the right amount of salt, this is it.  I rate these chips among my top three favorites.

review/text: I've recently had to change my diet and cut down on salt.  I'm a salt-aholic so this wasn't easy.  I found Madhouse Munchies chips in a Gourmet Kitchen store and I was amazed at how good they taste.  They have about half the sodium of other chips but taste delicious and satisfy the salt craving.  The store that carried these is far enough away that I don't get there often so I checked the internet.  I'm able to get a case of 12 bags delivered right to my door for a reasonable price.  Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: Madhouse Munchies Sea Salt & Vinegar Potato Chips
review/text: Do you have the Munchies?<br /><br />Light, non-oily, crispy with a balanced salt content, and perfect taste bud tang, Madhouse Munchies are highly recommended for those with a salt-and-vinegar fondness. This snack is made from select North American potatoes and is quite tasty, the way human nature intended.<br /><br />The only possible downside to this delight is the ingredient LACTOSE, which affects those allergic to milk.  Perhaps the company may consider an alternative version of these chips to satisfy a greater population.<br /><br />However, as they say, "because we cook with healthier oil [non-hydrogenated canola], chips are cholesterol free, 0g trans fat p/s, and has no MSG, preservatives, or artificial colors.<br /><br />Enjoy!

These chips are cooked in oil that is healthier (don't tell the kids) and taste way better than the average chip.  No oily taste like others, just potato and awesome spices.  I even stick them in the kids lunches.

review/text: I bought these chips because of all the positive reviews (and because they were cheap, with Amazon discounts), but I'm underwhelmed by both the Madhouse Munchies chip flavors I've purchased:  the Mesquite BBQ mentioned here, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDKZZK">Madhouse Munchies Sea Salt & Vinegar Potato Chips, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />The chips are perfectly edible (unlike some other chips I've tried, I won't have to give away every bag because I can't use them at all at home), but thin and insubstantial -- at least compared to the much superior Kettle brand chips I've been buying from Amazon, such as their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBVO">Kettle Chips, Sea Salt & Vinegar, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a> and their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4FI">Kettle Krinkle Cut Chips, Salt & Fresh Ground Pepper, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a> -- and the 'fire sweet' smokey quality of the barbecue flavor is a bit overpowering (especially with a weak chip underneath, offering nothing to back it up with other flavor notes).<br /><br />I'd prefer to get much more satisfaction and flavor in return for my caloric over-indulgence than is offered by Madhouse Munchies snacks so far.<br /><br />Unless you've already tried Madhouse Munchies brand from your local grocery store and loved their chips, I wouldn't advise purchasing this in bulk just yet.  There are far better chips available here for just a little more money (when you take advantage of sales and discounts).

When I received the box at my door, I was a little puzzled with how small it was, then VERY discouraged with how the chocolate was packaged. Nothing was punctured on mine, thankfully, and everything was how it should be. With that said, the only reason I give this a 4 star is because I only paid $12.99 and free 2-day shipping for this. I was able to open the package, have everything standing up like it shows in the actual picture, then wrap the bow around it myself. Needless to say, it looked much better with a little "tweaking". My boyfriend loves Ghirardelli chocolate so I'm sure he will be very pleased with this.
