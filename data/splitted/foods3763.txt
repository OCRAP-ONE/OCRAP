review/summary: Not what I expected...
review/text: This stuff smells like sulfur. I guess when I saw "smoked apple wood" I was expecting something different. There is probably an awesome recipe that this will go good with, but I haven't discovered it yet. I used it on roasted asparagus. I think I would have liked it better with regular sea salt. It's not the salt's fault that I can't figure out what to do with it. LOL!

review/summary: cookies all crumbled.
review/text: When I visit the store the cookies are always whole. I don't live near a Trader Joes so I thought I would try and order them. When I got the product there wasn't a whole cookie in the bag, all crumbs. Very disappointed at 8.00 a bag it wasn't a good deal. I can get them at a store cheaper but my daughter wanted them and so I got them. Not happy at all.... The cookies are good when they are a whole.....

It taste even better than then ones they have at the amusement parks.  All of my guest enjoy it so much, that when they know they are visiting they will always ask that I make it.

review/summary: great cotton candy, and a great price
review/text: I own a video store and was looking to stock some unique kinds of candy and snacks, so I chose to order the Mike & Ike cotton candy, as well as the Hot Tamales cotton candy, classic circus colors and Stars & Stripes.  The Mike & Ike cotton candy, as well as the Hot Tamales kind, are my best sellers at the store.  It isn't a super strong fruit flavor, but isn't as subtle as the cinnamon in the Hot Tamales kind.  Overall it's a great seller, kids love it, it shows up fresh and fluffy and has over a year shelf life I believe... though I will never have it sitting around even close to that long.  Highly recommended!

review/text: I purchased this food coloring hoping it would create black frosting. I read several reviews on this and other websites which suggested I use chocolate icing (as white icing + black food coloring= gray frosting) but this product did not darken the chocolate at ALL. I ended up using over half for one cake and still decided the color wasn't right. It was still obviously brown. Perhaps my expectations were too high.

review/text: I ordered the three pack of the Lime Coolers after hearing about them on the Paula Deen show.  When they arrived, I opened the bag and there were only 6 or so whole cookies, the rest were either in pieces or crumbs.  Amazon is great about keeping the customer satisfied and after I complained in an email, a replacement was sent.  The second shipment was in a similar state--they were packed tight, so who knows why they were in pieces.  They taste good but only order them if you like eating cookie crumbs and pieces.

review/summary: We got the byrd ...
review/text: Sadly - These cookies are not what I remember from living down in Florida. Originally, the cookies were white-coated, whole and zapped your tastebuds which immediately transported one to a mangrove swamp on a sunny day, sipping a lime/planters punch ... What I got was mostly crumbs, brown in colour, slightly stale and one half of the zap-in-the-mouth taste and was immediately transported to Buffalo, NY, for cold chicken wings. We checked all three tins and ended up tossing the lot.<br /><br />I believe that the Byrd group dumps their old/inferior stock in this manner just to gain a buck ... obviously, at our expense ... thusly ... giving us the byrd?<br /><br />I would recommend that Amazon re-evaluate their agreement with this company and take them to the woodshed for a 'chat'. I would further recommend avoiding a depressing/costly chance at happiness/nostalgia.

Being from the South, and only a few hours from Savannah where they're made I love supporting a local company. These are great for gifts and I have given them as Christmas gifts every year! Byrd cookies tend to be expensive, yes, but they are worth it and make great gifts.

review/summary: Best Turkey Jerky that I've tried
review/text: I've tried some options on amazon.com such as Jack Link's Turkey Jerky and Turkey Nuggets, Snackmasters Range Brown Turkey Jerky, Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky, among others from various retail outlets. Totally, I have had ~7 different brands of turkey jerky and ~8 of the beef variety .  Among turkey, Oberto is my favorite by far.<br /><br />Given that jerky is made by a dehydration process, dryness is inherent to jerky as a food.  Also, turkey is a dryer meat than beef (the most common jerky) and I've found turkey jerky to be, on average, dryer than beef jerky.  I prefer my jerky relatively moist.<br /><br />Oberto Turkey Jerky is by far the most moist jerky I've had (aside from the Oberto Pork brand). The package usually has very large strips that hold their water content for greater lengths of time.  The other brands I've tried are broken into small pieces and are very chewy & dry in comparison.  Another key aspect is the flavoring.  This product is well-flavored whereas other products often taste like proteinated cardboard.  For a teriyaki flavor, Oberto doesn't overdo on salt either and the entire product is natural and less processed.<br /><br />Overview:<br />Pros- Moist, Tastey, Natural & Minimally Processed<br />Cons- Oberto Turkey only comes in Teriyaki<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want Turkey Jerky and don't mind teriyaki, this is probably the best, easily obtainable product out there.

review/text: I'm a really big fan of the Jack Link's peppered beef jerky, but it can be hit or miss with the freshness. This stuff was pretty good though. I think the Jack Link's has a better taste due to more flavourings (the secret is in the soy sauce they use, I suspect) where this has a cleaner beef taste which some might like more.<br /><br />I think the beef strips in this brand are a bit too thick, but maybe that's just me.

review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: The texture of this jerky is good, and it's very moist compared to other turkey jerky I've had. However, I found the Teriyaki flavor much too sweet. I was hoping for a more subtle Teriyaki taste. To me, the flavor was a little overwhelming. There was no turkey flavor. Just the sweetness of the Teriyaki. I think 7 grams of sugar in a 1-ounce serving (1/3 of a package) seems like a lot. And look at the list of ingredients: Brown sugar is the #2 ingredient, sugar is the #4 ingredient, and pineapple juice concentrate is the #7 ingredient. That's quite a bit of sweetness. Too much sweetness for me.

review/text: Having had Jack Links jerky for a while I picked up this brand during one of Amazon's deals to try it out. While it is nice and the smokey flavour works well, there is a much sweeter flavour to it than Jack Links brand. Personally this puts me off this brand a little although others in my house do like the sweeter flavour.<br /><br />So it really depends what you want in your Teriyaki jerky and if you like it sweet or not.<br /><br />The jerky pieces are a good size though, they definitely give you some big jerky.

review/summary: Excellent product with variety of use
review/text: This is one product that I keep more on hand than anything else in my house.  I was only introduced to it about a year ago, but it is extremely versatile.  There are a couple of tricks that I've learned to get the most out of it though, and I'll share some of that here.<br /><br />Boiling - the product must be boiled before it can be used.  2 parts water brought to boil with 1 part quinoa.  Bring back to boil and then turn down to simmer for 9 minutes in a covered pot.  Turn off and then let sit for 20 minutes.  It will finish absorbing the rest of the water and do all it's tricks to get the white threat exposed.  It will be soft and fluffy and ready to use.  If you can put it in the fridge overnight and then fluff it up with a fork, this is when quinoa is at it's peak.  I keep some in the fridge for whatever I want later.<br /><br />Dinner - boil in chicken stock and add spices to get something like a healthy rice like product.  It has a nutty taste that is brought out by the salts.  While still hot, add butter, olive oil, garlic, and some goat cheese.  Stir gently till the cheese melts.<br /><br />Breakfast - boil in water as per above, and then mix with a small amount of coconut oil, raisins and craisins, toasted pine nuts, and some honey for an incredible cereal.  Eat it warm or cold right out of the fridge.  It is easy to transport, won't go bad quickly, and that and a yogurt are a great hotel breakfast you can depend on instead of the stale sugar rolls they serve down in the continental breakfast.<br /><br />Quinoa holds a sauce better than just about any rice or pasta product.

review/text: when this quinoa arrived I was so excited, it was so large and light-weight.  And, the seller was so nice, following-up to ensure that it had arrived safely.  unfortunately, I did not get around to using it right away.  First use, it was super gritty, despite rinsing: like eating sand.  So the second time around, I soaked it for 10 minutes.  Again, gritty.  The 3rd and final time, I soaked it an hour.  Still gritty AND mushy.  The remaining uncooked quinoa has been thrown-away.<br /><br />This is no reflection of the seller.  They were very thorough.

review/text: I'm chewing a piece right now for the review. I wish I could give half stars because I think it falls in about 2.5. Its not that its a terrible taste or bad texture, it just is very...blah for spearmint. The spearmint is very subtle. It almost reminds me of a sweet mint wannabe. This is a VERY sweet gum. After chewing for about 5 minutes most of the mint flavor is nearly gone. It has already started to taste bitter. I would suggest Orbit Spearmint and Spearmint Spritzer. I wanted to like Trident because it's the classic gum but it just falls short.

review/summary: very good taste
review/text: Trident Spearmint gum is quite good.  It is much healthier than many brands of gum that my kids prefer.  However, the relatively strong spearmint flavor "compensates" for the lack of unhealthy things (I'm serious!  Other brands do seem to be much less healthy AND the jolt offered by this flavor really does appeal to the kids.  It comes in packets a bit firmer than those from past years.  I ordered a subscription - so I am scheduled to receive semi-annual deliveries - it's a good price, as is, but very, very competitive with other brands.  I'm not a dentist, so I can't recommend it for dental hygiene purposes.  I do believe that gum can be a useful substitute for folks who've drank or smoked A LITTLE too much and who wish to quit (along with other things).  I have never found ANY brand or flavor of gum to last longer than 5 minutes, by which time it has no flavor left, the way that I chew anyways.  A stick of gum or a cigarette?  Which'll kill me from lung cancer?  I think that Trident has a good, credible name.  The flavor is good.  The price, in bulk, is great.  I strongly recommend that folks try it if you haven't before, especially if you like the taste of spearmint.  I'd give it an "A-".  (If they could come up with a gum that lasts for hours, I'd bump it up to an A+.

I do think it's rather ironic, though, that "trident" means "three teeth" in Latin.  Did anyone research this before naming the product???

review/summary: My Dog Loves This Food
review/text: I have a 12 year old golden retriever.  I have been feeding him Happy Hips treats for almost a year hoping the glucosamine helps with his arthritis.  He eats the treats like crazy.  I like the fact they are apple, banana, chicken and sweet potato.  They are healthier than store bought treats.  I have the same hope for the chicken & oats dry dog food. This dog food came the other day, I cut the bag open to dump it into a plastic tub and by mistake I tipped it over a little and some of it went scattered all over the floor.  Well, my dog with the arthrtis jumped right up and cleaned up the floor in no time, tried sticking his head in the bag and then wagged his tale licking my face.  If this is as good as the treats, I know it will help with his arthritis.  Amazon is the cheapest I have found for this food, plus the free shipping is a bonus.  I bought mine when Amazon had a 20 percent promotion so it was an added bonus.  Thanks Dogswell and Amazon.

review/summary: Hooked On Happy Hips
review/text: It's simple really, My dog is a very picky eater, not to mention she's allergic to so many things. We tried a lot of the name brand dog foods out there (Iams, Avoderm, Science Diet). Nothing worked, so then one night when she was out of food I went to the store and grabbed two small bags of dog food. Happy Hips was one of them. She immediately wanted to smell the bag right after opening it (which she never did before), and as soon as we put it in her bowl she devoured it. With all of the dog food we had previously given her we always had to mix it with something just to get her to eat it, that wasn't the case with Happy Hips, she ate it dry the first night and is still eating it dry 2 months later. She always got bored with the other dog food, after a couple weeks she would stop eating and/or put her nose up to it. She doesn't do that with Happy Hips. She absolutely loves it. Plus it's all natural and made in the U.S.A. You pay more for it, but it's well worth it. If you have never given this to your dog, it may be best to start them off with 4 pound bag or find somewhere you can get a free sample. But I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has a dog. I have also found that Amazon is so far the cheapest place to buy this dog food, and when I buy it, I get the free shipping as well.

review/text: I first found this product about a year ago through their free "mini-bag" giveaway. Nookie, my malamute, is a large dog that is susceptible to hip issues. I first had switched her over to the Happy Hips formula and saw that she walked without a limb for the first time in over a year. This took about six months, but was noticeable after about 4 months of eating Happy Hips. I was so pleased with the outcome that I transitioned my smaller, older dog to Happy Hips. My little dog, Steeler, was having back issues as she is getting older. After about 6 months eating Happy Hips, she is out running around like a puppy...she is now 13 years old. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a pet with joint problems or may have those issues later down the road.

review/summary: This food really made a difference in my dog's joint health/pain
review/text: My dog was 8+yrs old when I first bought Happy Hips by Dr. Dogswell for him to try - within a week my dog went from stumbling and walking slow, and occasionally buckling in the front shoulders during tight turns, to frisking like the younger dog he used to be - no buckling, back to a trotting gait, and no evidence of pain!  I've kept him on the food for the past two years, occasionally mixing in other food for variety - but this stuff really made a difference for my dog, so I'm swearing by it and recommending it to others.  I had been supplementing his previous food (Pedigree) with expensive pills that promised improved joint health, and they never seemed to do anything.  Now my dog is just primarily eating the Dr. Dogswell food (no supplements, but occasional mixing in of Newman's Own or Rachel Ray's food for variety) and he's still doing great.

review/text: My dog is very picky about her food and she has a lot of itching problems.  We have been told many time that her skin problems may have something to do with her diet.  We have tried many types of food, but this one seems to work best.  She really likes it and, although itching problem hasn't gone away, it does seem a little better. I am no health food expert, but based on what I am told by some Vets, this is a healthy product.  Final assessment: The extra cost of this food is worth the benefits of her eating more regularly; that she is eating a healthier food; and her itching seems to be somewhat relieved.  Also, I like having the bag delivered to my house at no charge in 2 days.  Schlepping big bag of dog food from the pet store  to my house is a pain.

She lives in an apartment with her cat and couldn't take this sweet chow mix home with her when as a stray she entered her work place and make a bee line right to my daughter.  We are all dog people and so she asked me to take in another stray.  Soon after our little Juvie began to drag herself around.  We took her into the vets and her hips are really out of whack.  There was nothing we could do or afford.  She seemed happy but very inactive.  After I began feeding her the Happy Hip, which she loves, she began standing more and even playing with the new puppy.  I began feeding my other dog (he is two years old now), mixing the old food with the Happy Hips.  He will eat all the Happy Hips and leave the old food until I admonish him to finish his dinner.  Both dogs are really happy with Happy Hips.

review/summary: My dog enjoys it and it helps her hips.
review/text: My dog was diagnosed with hip dysplasia as a 6-month old puppy.  The vet said it was the worst case he'd seen in a puppy her age and we were told that she wouldn't be able to walk by the time she was three if we didn't have an expensive surgery done.  I've tried various supplements and foods over the years and although she may sway a bit when walking and tire easily she's now 8 years old and we frequently go on short hikes together.<br /><br />I started feeding her Happy Hips about 4 months ago.  Since that time I've cut out any other supplements and paid close attention to how she does.  She readily eats the food and doesn't gorge herself when eating.  She seems to have more energy and stamina now.  I don't want to push her too hard but last weekend I took her on a 4 mile hike over aggressive terrain, much more than we normally do, she led the pack the whole way and even jumped in the truck quickly when we were done.  In the past I've had to lift her into the truck at the end of any hikes.  She spent the rest of the day sleeping but the next day was up and going again.  Overall I'm very impressed with my dog's health and since this has been her food over the last several months it has to be a factor in how she's doing.  I originally was going to rate this 4 stars but really have not complaints at all and my pup is doing great so I upped it to 5 stars.<br /><br />As a side note I read reviews online before feeding my dog this food and found that it is rated well by a few independent review sites.

review/summary: This Food is Absolutely Fantastic
review/text: My overweight little girl not only got down to a healthy size; but was cured of her lameness thanks to this food. Several years ago, she began walking on three legs.  The leg pulled to her body didn't seem to cause her any acute pain--she just didn't want to use it.  Vets and specialists armed with x-rays and other tests conferred and couldn't decide what was wrong with her.  A $7000 surgery was suggested; but I tried this food fist (coupled with Happy Hips chicken jerky treats).  After SIX months of being lame, within three weeks she was walking on all four legs and never had the problem again.  She has a shiny coat, bright eyes and lots of energy (she's nine years old).<br /><br />I would be a wreck if this ever went off the market.<br /><br />Also of note, this food seems super-healthy: no by-products, no fillers, no yucky things.  It seems as whole and healthy as you can get whilst using a manufactured dry food.  And even better, it has all her favorite table foods to eat--blueberries, chicken, sweet potatoes, apples, carrots, etc.<br /><br />There's a serving suggestion on the back of the package.  My dog is about 10 pounds and I feed her 1/2 cup of food a day.  (1/4 cup in the a.m. and 1/4 cup in the p.m.).  When she's super active (or seems terribly hungry), I give her more.  Also remember I supplement her diet with Happy Hips chicken jerky treats and the occasional raw fruit or vegetable when I'm cooking.  In short, a 4-pound bag lasts her three weeks to a month (if you're wondering how much to order on the subscription plan).<br /><br />Let me know if you have questions.

review/summary: Sr. Lab loves this food!!
review/text: Our 12+ yr old lab has been a finnicky eater for the past few years.  I've tried anything and everything to get her to eat. This food was new at our grocery store and I thought I'd give it a try.  She loves it!!!  This is the first 'dry'  dog food she eats without any extras ( fruit, veggies, meats etc)  Yesterday, the first day, she ate approx 4 cups of this food, typically she doesn't eat that much.  Well, let's see if that was a fluke, this morning she ate another 2 cups.  This food isn't really dry, it's a bit moist.  It smells great.  I can't believe our dog is eating it, much less so much of it.  I plan on getting the larger size bag from Amazon and trying some of the treats.

review/summary: This won't be in the rotation
review/text: I've complained about the expiration dates when ordering from amzaon. This had the same problem. While the ingredients look decent, even though it has chicken meal, my dog was not thrilled with this food at all. She's 9 yrs old and I thought the Glucosamine would be beneficial to her. So even though the dog food is going to expire in 4 months, I've ended up having to give it away to someone else as she just looks at the food and back at me like "Really you expect me to eat this" I will say that she is a very picky eater. So it maybe great for others, just not for my dog.

review/summary: Not good food
review/text: I had my dog on this food until he developed an infection in his anal glands. My vet told me not to use this food anymore because it is made in china and the glucosamine in the Happy Hips formula provides no benefit to my dog because the amount of glucosamine is too small and its not a high quality. He had us switch to Royal Canin<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00068K2OK">Royal Canin Dry Dog Food, Giant Breed Adult 28 Formula, 35-Pound Bag</a> - so far our dog is doing really well with this food, firmer stool, loves to eat it, etc. And for the glucosamine/chondroitin/MSM we are using Dasaquin<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MCVGEA">Nutramax Dasuquin with MSM for Large Dogs - 150 Tablets</a> which is a pharmaceutical grade supplement, same manufactorer makes a supplement for human consumption as well.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor- buy a solid supplement and a dog food that is not produced in China.

review/summary: Good quality food
review/text: I generally feed my dog a raw diet but I did try out a bag of this when trying to save some money and I was pretty pleased with it. Generally when she is on kibble you can tell, her skin gets more dandruff, she sheds more and she will poop 4-5 times a day. She didn't have as much of a problem with this kibble. It's definitely one I would order again if I decide to put her on kibble for a while. My only complaints are that "millet" is listed as the second ingredient, so its not a grain free kibble and it still has a fair amount of grain filler if its listed right after beef. Undoubtedly still better than corn filler though.

review/summary: An Excellent Way To Begin the Morning
review/text: This smoky falvoured black tea expertly blends the essential spices of Keemun, Darjeeling, Ceylon, and Assam to create a powerful brew. Unlike the numerous herbal teas that I frequently indulge in, the flavour of this brew is more akin to the traditional teas in that the flavour and aroma is heady and tends more toward bitterness. Due to this aspect, I found that cream was conducive to this brew and that for those who prefer a more mild tea, brewing is best at three minutes. Although I usually do not indulge in such strong tea, I found this to be the quintessential compliment to the breakfast atmosphere in that its invigorating taste and potent tinge helped to bring me more fully awake. Each element of the tea interwove to create a complimentary and elegant taste that no true tea connoisseur should miss. Overall, this having been my first venture into the Numi tea brand, I can envision myself returning to this particular brand in future.<br /><br />- Ravenova

review/summary: A smooth, subtle blend.
review/text: Numi has created a breakfast blend with four of the most popular black teas--Keemun, Assam, Ceylon and Darjeeling. The aroma is a fine grassy floral tea blend. The leading flavor is Keemun, a malty, slightly smoky flavor. This is a smooth subtle cup of tea, without some of the more characteristic robustness of most Breakfast blends.  However, it is still a very stimulating blend--fairly high in caffeine I would guess from its effect!  Unfortunately, Numi does not list caffeine count on the box.<br /><br />Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions. Numi uses only 100% natural ingredients without added oils or "natural flavorings".

review/summary: MY 18-MONTH OLD MALTY-POO LOVES THIS
review/text: I've had my malty-poo, Chloe since she was 5-weeks (don't get me started on that...I was told she was 8 weeks when she was handed down to me).  I've gone through quite a journey with her but overall she is my little girl and I was meant to have her.<br /><br />We've gone through so many brands of foods and she's liked some (Wellness, Natural Balance, Blue, Ultra) and hated some (Instinct, Castor and Pollux UltraMix, Innova).  Halo seems to have become her favorite so we've stuck by it for the last four or five months and Chloe doesn't seem to tire of it nor does she show any type of allergies that I noticed with some of her other foods.<br /><br />Lastly, I discovered Halo because I heard Ellen Degeneres was co-owner and if you know anything about Ellen you know that not only is she a humanitarian but she also loves animals so I would hope that this is not just a money making venture for her but that she has put her name behind something that is truthfully healthy for dogs.  Chloe has grown up on kibbles along with sliced carrots, celery, apples and she also gets a boiled piece of chicken every few weeks.  She doesn't like just any treat or any food and she's been like that since we got her.  She likes her Halo and she seems comfortable with the size of the kibble along with enjoying the taste so that is the ultimate gauge.  In terms of price, we do the subscribe and save and it usually falls below the price Petco has.<br /><br />If you have picky eaters similar to Chloe's breed, leave me a comment if you have any suggestions, tips or stories of your own to share.

review/text: If you order a pound of Tootsie Rolls you're in for a treat.  Last Halloween I ordered 12 for the different Trick or Treaters in my neighborhood and filled a large pumpkin with the bitesize treats.  Would you believe it, the kids ran me out of 12 full pounds!  I suspect that some of them doubled back to my doorbell once they saw the quality of goodies I was handing out.  Don't worry, I kept a few for myself too.  Because as long as you're a kid at heart, you'll keep your yen for America's original candy, Tootsie Rolls, the treat so tasty they named a movie after it.<br /><br />You don't need to give them any special treatment.  They will keep in a candy dish in your apartment or home, or they can be safely and easily stored in cupboard or freezer.  Warning, don't try to give them to your cat, I have heard that they are not too good for our feline friends.

review/summary: An Institution
review/text: I would guess that when Leo Hirshfield first began producing Tootsie Rolls in New York City that he never guessed that more than a century later the chocolate candy would be a favorite of children around the world.  This candy was originally a children's favorite because it was a penny candy, it was one of the first individually wrapped candies, and it was durable under a variety of conditions, like being in a child's pocket.<br /><br />Leo Hirshfield first produced Tootsie Rolls in 1896.  Hirshfield named the candy after his five-year-old daughter, whose nickname was Tootsie.  Tootsie Rolls became even more popular as the United States emerged from the Great Depression.  Tootsie Rolls went to war in World War II as a part of soldiers' rations, and it became a G.I.'s favorite for the same reason it was a children's favorite; it was wrapped and durable under a variety of conditions.  The candy also provided a quick energy boost.<br /><br />Tootsie Rolls are chewy and have a mild chocolate flavor with modest sweetness.  While Tootsie Rolls get harder when cold, they become soft again when warmed, yet they never get so soft in normal circumstances that they actually melt.  However, in a child's pocket they can get very soft.<br /><br />Tootsie Roll Industries is now a candy giant, and yet the original candy retains all its charm and is very much like the original made by Leo Hirshfield.  Tootsie Rolls has now expanded to numerous other countries, and yet in many ways this popular candy is an American institution.<br /><br />For a flavor experience I also recommend assorted Tootsie Rolls, which has included lemon, vanilla and cherry.

review/summary: I fed my son mystery formula for months!!!!!
review/text: After reading other customer reviews about a different label being underneath the Earth's Best label I went to look under my labels. Sure enough there is the same light blue label remains as in the other customer reviews. I am so upset that I don't know what I have been feeding my baby! I thought I was feeding him good formula. If anyone finds out what it actually is I would love to know. Don't order this formula from amazon!

review/summary: Buyers BEWARE!
review/text: Buyers Beware! The can of formula I received had an Earth's Best label placed on top of a torn off label of some unknown formula underneath (nothing that even close to resembled an Earth's Best label). I contacted Amazon and received a full refund for the product. Amazon told me they receive this product directly from the manufacturer with no middle man so they could not explain my experience and suggested I contact Earth's Best.<br /><br />I contacted Earth's Best and was told over and over again that they would NEVER re-label any of their products, once again not explaining how this could happen. Leading me to believe this product is NOT Earth's Best formula but something else being re-labeled. If you read other reviews you will see I am not the first person to experience this. It was the other reviews that made me peel off the Earth's Best label and look underneath.<br /><br />I purchased a can of Earth's Best formula today at a local grocery store and peeled off the label to check and see what it would look like underneath, and it was a clean new can - It looked nothing like the can I received from Amazon that had an old torn mystery label underneath.

review/summary: Scary, mine was in a repackaged container!
review/text: I'm half way though the first can I have ever bought and I happened to take the outside wrapper off.  To my dismay, I found that there had been another wrapper on the container.  The original wrapper was a a purple/blue color, now I have no idea what I have given my daughter, was a it was I thought I bought or some unknown formula repackaged.  I'm livid.  This is scary as hell.<br /><br />Do not trust this formula.

review/text: I hate the idea of giving my son soy formula but since that is all he can have right now I feel better knowing it is organic and a whole soy rather than soy isolate. I have always rcvd this promptly.

review/summary: Corn Syrup Solids: First Ingredient
review/text: I bought this product because I want the best for my baby. I'm willing to pay extra and to do the research.  This product uses corn syrup solids in bulk, a cheap sweetener.  Don't waste your money on this unhealthy product.

review/text: I like this formula, however I don't like that it is made up of corn. My favorite formula brand would be Babys Only Organic Soy. It is made from brown rice syrup and only costs 10$ for 12.7 oz at My local Henrys Market!

review/summary: Constipation Nation
review/text: After using almost every Soy Infant Formula out there, I began feeling guilty about the possibility of exposing my little one to GMO's.  So I ordered Earth's Best Organic Infant Formula in the soy version and my 5 month old didn't go to the bathroom for 3.5 days!  It was terrible and she has never experience this type of constipation with the other well-known, non-organic formulas.  I just couldn't believe that it was this organic formula which would be more pure and free of fillers that the other formulas so about a week later I gave it to her again and voila! She again didn't have a bowel movement for an entire 3 days!  I will not be using the rest of the formula I bought.<br />I can say on the up side when you open up the tin you really can see and smell a difference with this formula; it is light and flakey, white in colour (I find some of the other formulas are thick and yellowish), and it seems more natural.  That is probably why it constipated my infant, if it has less 'grease/bad-stuff' to slide through her system, it probably just got stuck.  The regular store-bought formulas have tons of (bad) corn syrup and are more likely to be expelled easier.<br />I'm going to try Nature's One organic infant formula as soon as I can get some.
