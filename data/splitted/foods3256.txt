review/summary: Tastes Like Celery
review/text: I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds.

review/summary: Best chips EVER
review/text: So my cafe at work switch to a bunch of chips I don't like and some Popchips.  Then they added these sweet potato chips and they're the only ones I buy now.  The sad thing is that these are hard to find at stores.  You'll find plenty of the other Popchip flavors, but not the sweet potato.  So I broke down and bought a box.  I went with the 3-ounce version because the price per oz was lower than the smaller bags.  These bags aren't TOO big, and I just use a clip on them to keep the air out after they're opened.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I love Popchips. They are a lot different than regular potato chips, but they are quite good. Sea Salt and Vinegar and Chili Lime are my two favorite flavors, and I'd like to try Parmesan Garlic one day (they don't seem to be sold in my area for some reason). Popchips are lower in calories and fat than most regular potato chips, which makes them a healthier alternative when you're looking for something crunchy to snack on. I like to take them to movies (in those rare theatres that don't have 'no outside food' signs) to eat in lieu of butter-laden popcorn. If you're on the fence about buying these, I would recommend trying a small bag to see if you like them before buying one of these big multi-pack deals. I've seen them at a lot of grocery stores--that's where I buy mine. They really are quite different from regular potato chips, but they're tasty and definitely worth trying.

review/summary: Not exactly like traditional potato chips, but a great substitute
review/text: One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips.  I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next.

review/summary: Fantastic chips!!!
review/text: I want to start out by saying that i thought at first that a bag with only 120 calories and 4 grams of fat (no saturated or trans) for every 20 chips was going to taste like crap. I must say that not only was i wrong, that this is my favorite BBQ chip on the market today. They are light and you cannot taste any fat or grease after eating them. That's because they aren't baked or fried, just popped as their name suggests. These chips are very easy to dip as well. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!

review/summary: Holy SALT, Batman!
review/text: We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a "healthier" alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their "original" flavor...I can't imagine what the "Salt & Pepper" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a "healthy" alternative to chips.

review/summary: Sweet Potato Popchip Goodness!
review/text: As a kid, I scarfed bags of the Calbee Sweet Potato chips that my mom would pick up at the local Asian market. As my tastes refined in adulthood, I was less inclined to buy bags of those chips that resembled styrofoam even if I still craved their sugary sweet and salty flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips Sweet Potato chips are the adult version of the snack I grew up with. There's a delicious sweet and salty mix in every bite.  The chip is light and airy, without resembling a foamy rice cake and the deep orange hue is the color of a perfectly roasted sweet potato.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of sweet potato chips from Amazon in the past (Both the "Terra" & "Food Should Taste Good" chips) which have all been good, but they didn't play up the sweet and salty combo quite as much as I'd like. The Terra chips are more like simple sliced sweet potatoes, oven dried and turned into chips; the Food Should Taste Good chips are like yummy, sweet potato flavored, salty tortilla chips; and these Pop Chips sweet potato chips are, well... sweet potato pop chips.  If you've never had a pop chip before, the weight of an individual chip probably most resembles Baked Lays - but with a puckered, air-puffed texture.<br /><br />There are 100 calories per bag.  24 bags come nicely packed in a box that you can tear open for a neat display in your pantry.  I've purchased bagged chips online a number of times and have received packages where the chips were thrown into a box which was thrown into an Amazon box for shipping so by the time they got to me, all the chips were broken.  Not so with this packaging, they're tightly packed so the the bags don't shift around much in shipping and the few bags we've already eaten have had no more broken chips than what we'd get from picking up a bag in the store.<br /><br />Happy snacking!

review/text: We love the plain PopChips (seasoned with salt only).  These salt & pepper chips are very spicy, so you only want to buy these if you REALLY like that black pepper burn.  Also, there IS enough GLUTEN in the product to cause a reaction IF YOU ARE "ALLERGIC" TO GLUTEN.  I found that eating them once in a while was not a big deal, but eating them frequently truly was/is a problem for me.  They taste GOOD, but be careful if you have food allergies.  Just sayin'...

review/summary: Salt and Vinegar addict
review/text: I'm not particularly health conscious, but when the general store on campus only had salt and vinegar (my favorite chip flavor) in the popchips brand, I figured I'd give these a try. To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. The texture, which is between a chip and a rice cake, is a bit thicker than usual but has a very satisfying crunch. It also helps the chips to keep from crumbling too easily. The sea salt and vinegar flavor is the perfect combination of salty and tangy, and while these are quite filling, I don't fill sick after I binge on a whole bag the way I would with ordinary chips. I never liked baked chips much (the texture was just off for me) but I think I might actually prefer these to ordinary potato chips.

I ate three bags on different days and on an empty stomach just to make sure I wasn't mistaken. Not even my pit bull would touch these (he's a bit of a snob though). These just sit on the cupboard (on death-row) awaiting their expiration date .

review/text: (Three times I've tried to post a review of these and it never goes through... forgive my abruptness.)<br /><br />Popchips? As in, potato chips puffed like popcorn? You got it, bub. Surprising lightness to them--much more so than expected, which allows the taste of the toppings (in this case, chili lime) to seem supercharged. This can be a good thing or not, depending on how sensitive your tongue is. Also, the texture is passing strange at first. Takes a bit of getting used to, but once you're used to it, you'll be popping these like, well, popcorn.

They're made with sweet potatoes so it makes sense.  Another interesting Popchips feature is that they are "popped"(hence the name, again, makes sense) rather than fried or baked... gives it an oriental rice snack kind of consistency.  All in all very pleased with these, give them a try for yourself, whether a health nut or not(a .8 oz bag of these is about 1/3rd the fat and half the rest of the nutrition facts numbers of a full oz of Lays for the record).

review/text: We've re-ordered the original potato Popchips several times since we first tried them.  They are perfect for snackers who crave salty crunchy things more than sweets.  There's only 100 calories per bag and you actually get enough to feel satisfied.  We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right, like you've never done it.)

review/summary: Super light, quite tasty, overpriced
review/text: We enjoyed these, as they have a light taste unencumbered by heavy oils and the byproducts of frying. No doubt they're much healthier than your standard potato chips, though I will say that Terra's sweet potato chips blow these away for taste, but then they're fried.<br /><br />The main issue here is value. These chips weigh about half what a bag of good chips cost, for the same money. Healthy or not, there needs to be some value, and at a buck for well under an ounce, I'm not sure these have that; I need to eat two bags to feel like I've had a snack. If you only need a tiny bit of something to make you feel full, then this might be perfect, though.<br /><br />But if you want to crunch a lot, don't want fried food, and prefer the sensation of eating a lot to actually eating a lot (dieters!), this would be a fine snack, and a unique taste.

review/summary: If you enjoy sweet potatoes, you'll enjoy these
review/text: I really enjoy sweet potato chips, sweet potato fries, baked sweet potatoes, etc., so I was eager to try these Popchips.  They did not disappoint!  The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.  I should also mention that they are not fans of sweet potatoes, and did not care for these either.  That's ok - more for me!

review/summary: Surprisingly delicious!
review/text: Wow, these are really good!  At first, I didn't understand "Popchips", and I was actually expecting something like regular fried potato chips, only made from sweet potatos.  The Popchips are very different from that!<br /><br />These contain rice flour as well as sweet potatos, and they are kind of air-popped, very light like popcorn.  Texture-wise, they remind me of "Munchos" only lighter and without the oily feel and taste.  Remember Munchos?  These are WAY better.<br /><br />Next thing - the flavor from the sweet potatos is YUMMY!  I know when I first read "rice flour" in the ingredients, I was thinking those cardboard-like rice cakes.  The sweet potato completely takes away any blandness or boringness and adds good taste.  And there is just a touch of salt - just enough to bring out the YUM without overdoing it.<br /><br />Finally, the package size.  When I saw "0.8 ounce", I expected that I would want two, three, or even four bags of these at a time.  Nope - one bag is a good snack!  Not that 0.8 is a big bag, or "filling" or anything like that, but the bag is just the right size, which is a very pleasant surpise to me!  I finish the last chips, like the last of the salt from my fingers, and I feel satisfied - like, wow, that was tasty and just right!  At Amazon's prices, I believe I will be buying these regularly!

I think if they had been a different flavor, then maybe I would have liked them more.  But everytime I ate them, the chili powder threatened to bring on an asthma attack.<br /><br />Next time I'm trying the Vinegar and Sea Salt!

I dont much care for this chili lime flavor though but i can definitely see myself getting other popchips flavors that i would prefer more.<br /><br />The flavor is evenly balanced out between spicy (chili) and sour (lime). I personally dont like sour chips much but these werent too bad in that sense. The chili is quite spicy though. It worth a try unless you really hate spicy chips or sour chips.

review/summary: If You Like Sweet Potatos, You'll Like These.
review/text: I am glad I got a whole case of these, simple because, after the first bag (keep in mind, these are small single serving bags), I was not impressed, and the sweet potato flavor overwhelmed me, but after eating my second bag, I liked them, a lot!<br /><br />  They are a little salty, but still sweet, and they are a bit akin to the chip version of a baked sweet potato with some butter and maple syrup, or at least that's how they tasted to me after getting over the initial reaction anyway!<br /><br />  My husband ended up eating the majority of them, not because I didn't want to eat them, but because he liked them so much!  It took little over a week for him to eat 2/3 of the box...  ;P  Me eating a bag like every other day, not realizing my supply was rapidly diminishing....<br /><br />  Needless to say, I will absolutely be buying myself a case of these in the very near future!  A great snack, and a wonderful change to the normal pop chips!  :D<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

review/text: SWEET POTATO<br />Pros:<br />- Amazing Taste<br />- Good packaging, almost no chips ever broken, all full shape.<br />- Great nutrition for such a tasty chip (hardly any salt)<br />- Perfect serving in the bag<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Hard to open the bag<br /><br />These chips are now my favorite brand, especially these sweet potato ones.  Since the order comes in a big "retail box" that comes with a count of 24, i gave them to out to friends and coworkers.  EVERY SINGLE PERSON was blown away by the taste.  Ironically, every person also commented on how hard it was to open the actual package. :)  Now the next dilemma is trying to decide... should i buy the sweet potato ones since they were so good, or try another flavor.<br /><br />For the current asking price, it is actually cheaper than buying other branded chips at the store.  Once again, these things blew my mind in that chips could be so good.

review/summary: It's not fried!
review/text: I am on a restricted diet, so these popchips was something I was eager to try.  I am always on the lookout for healthy alternatives to snacking - these were neither fried nor baked (although I will gladly eat a baked chip over a fried potato chip) - popped chips... they reminded me somewhat of Pringles, except the salt content was much lower and not that greasy either.  And, using sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes caught my eye as well.<br /><br />I loved these popchips.  They are slightly sweet and definitely quenches my need for a snack in the middle of the day.  I've seen these at my local Sprouts (not just in sweet potato flavor but other choices as well) and recommend them.  I think it's wonderful to see different types of alternative ways to healthy snacking available to the consumer.

review/summary: Mixed reviews from my family
review/text: Let me start by saying that I am not a sweet potato fan, however, my daughter and husband are, and since we are always looking for healthier snacks, this looked like a good option. There are only 3 grams of fat in a .8 oz snack bag, so they are much better for you then regular chips and if I remember correctly, are even healthier than the regular potato popchips. Personally, I thought the chips were just OK, but my daughter and husband love them, so I averaged out our reviews to end up with 4 stars.<br /><br />When I first bit into a chip I found it intensely sweet but then quickly I tasted the salt and it formed a nice balance, though after eating several I did find them more sweet than salty overall. They are really very light and not at all greasy. If you are a fan of sweet potatoes, you will probably like these chips. If sweet potatoes aren't your thing, these probably won't sway you (they didn't for me).

review/summary: Tangy and terrific
review/text: When I asked my older daughter to describe this flavor, she said to be sure to mention the word tangy. That is a fair description as the lime does heighten the taste buds and enhances the slight heat from the chili.<br /><br />My family really enjoys this flavor and it is among our favorites. We have tried most of the other varieties of Popchips and have our own preferences. My older daughter likes salt and pepper, barbecue, and this flavor the best. I like barbecue, sour cream and onion, and this flavor the best. My wife likes salt and vinegar and this flavor the best. My younger daughter does not like this flavor. She prefers barbecue, cheese, and sour cream and onion. Our least favorite is the original, probably because it is so plain by comparison.<br /><br />To me, Popchips are sort of a cross of potato chips, popcorn, and rice cakes. They are potato, but popped like popcorn and sort of puffy like rice cakes. They definitely have more flavor than many rice cakes and are a nice alternative to popcorn. They also can be used with dips although they never seem to last very long in our house.

Popchips offer a chip like substance,with the promise of low fat.<br /><br />They crunch like chips but don't quite have a chip like texture; it's closer to a rice cake.  The seasoning is decent as well.  They have a surprising amount of a great sweet potato flavor.<br /><br />The ingredients are okay as far as healthiness.  I like that rice flour is the first ingredient rather than potatoes or corn.  You still get oil, although less than normal chips.  There's more salt and sugar than I would like.<br /><br />In the end I found myself munching through the case of 24 fairly quickly.  Popchips taste good and aren't as bad for you.  Check them out!

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: For those who have never tried Popchips before, they are not exactly a normal potato chip.  Popchips are air popped rather than fried.  They have a sort of puffy physical trait and kind of remind me of the Munchos chips I used to eat as a kid.  You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just "different" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.

They are ok but not as good as a fried chip.  Maybe eating these will discourage me from chips period.  Like some other people making comments, I'll probably finish the box and not buy again.

review/text: I'm on a diet and there are times when I just want something crunchy. But I also have high blood pressure so a lot of snacks that I use as a treat are too high-sodium for me. I eat rice cakes with peanut butter or cottage cheese once in a while and I happened to see Popchips on Amazon.com. These <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0">Popchips Original Potato Chips, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a> were advertised at a special price and all the flavored ones were sold out, so I decided to try the original flavor. After trying my first bag I have a few comments.<br />1. Great service - I ordered them on 1/27, and they were delivered on 2/3, with no damage to the packaging.<br />2. I like the 24-pack that are individual servings because that helps me regulate portion control.<br />3. As a previous reviewer noted they do taste somewhat like Pringles - whether that's good or bad is up to individual tastes.<br />4. The nutritional information isn't terrible: a serving has 100 calories, 3 grams of fat with no cholesterol or saturated/trans fat, and only 160 mg.sodium; Pringles also contains 160 mg of sodium but has 150 calories and 9 grams of fat, as compared to potato chips with an average of 150 calories, 180 mg. sodium, and 10 grams fat, and pretzels with 110 calories, 450 mg sodium, and 1 gram fat.<br />5. They are kind of dry and bland, but are delicious with salsa - I really liked them with Costco's peach mango salsa! I don't have cottage cheese in the house so I couldn't try that. And I think peanut butter wouldn't be good unless something "wet" like sugar-free jam or jelly is also added.<br />I just got them so I'm not sure if I'll reorder another box; I think I'm going to next order Amazon's 6-flavor variety pack (4 Original Potato, 4 BBQ, 4 Salt & Pepper, 4 Sea Salt & Vinegar, 4 Sour Cream & Onion, 4 Cheddar)before deciding. I would give them 3 stars if my review was just based on taste; I'm giving 4 stars because I really want to like them because they're more healthy and I can think of lots of healthy foods to use them with - why not tuna,, egg salad, etc?

review/summary: Where have you been all my life?
review/text: I've never heard of these chips, but when I was offered the chance to review them, I got the Popchips Sweet Potato. DH had a heart attack last September and, after getting two stents put in, has had to cut out all of his beloved snacks, largely due to the high fat content and sodium (especially the sodium). I've been looking for something "snacky" with reduced sodium that isn't awful, and these are just the ticket. One .8 ounce bag, one serving, is a nice round 100 calories with only 3g of fat (.5g polyunsaturated, 2g monounsaturated), no cholesterol, 16g carbs, and 95mg of sodium. They have a bit of a salty taste, and they aren't very sweet with only 2g of sugar. I think they'd make an interesting dip chip with a plain-yogurt-based dip.<br /><br />I liked these Popchips so much that I got the next lowest sodium kind, the Chili Lime Potato flavor with 170mg of sodium and everything else the same except 1g of fiber. DH can have no more than 1500mg of sodium per day, but considering I'm using mostly frozen vegetables and not adding any salt to anything, I think he can have a bag of these on occasion without worry. And yowie zowie! What a big burst of flavor! The Chili Lime Potato Popchips are definitely the go-to chip when you've got to have something that tastes really "bad for you."<br /><br />I expect we're going to be signing up to get our Popchips delivered regularly via Amazon subscription. If we had been eating these Popchips instead of the regular high-fat/high-sodium/high-carb fare all along, I expect we'd both be a lot healthier now. A highly recommended product.

review/summary: Really sweet but sort of tasty
review/text: At 100 calories a bag these are a nice substitute for that afternoon craving of crunchy chips. The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack.

review/summary: I love Popchips, but I don't love this flavor
review/text: As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips.

review/summary: Not as good as I'd hoped
review/text: I had been eying the Popchips brand for some time but I they seemed too expensive and I passed. So, when I got the opportunity to review them, I was so excited to try them out. Unfortunately they did not live up to any expectations that I had from the good things I heard about them. The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime "flavor" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called "chili" flavor is almost non-existent and not enjoyable. It doesn't add anything in my opinion. Despite my experience these chips have good reviews. That tells me that I just need to try other flavors. This one needs improvement.

review/text: These are super tasty treats for days when you want something crunchy and salty.  I didn't find them overly salty as some commented.  They are very good and I would buy them again and again if the price were lower.  I got them as a special (24 single serve bags for $14) and would buy again at that price just to keep around as snacks.  Each bag is 100 cals and you actually feel like you are getting a real bag of potato chips.  Yummy.

review/text: I dislike it when they lump reviews for all flavors together. I have to rate these 5 stars because most flavors are amazing. I love popchips. The bbq and cheese ones are my fav, but recently ordered the sweet potatoes and found them to be lacking in taste. In fact, they tasted just like all the other types of chips, lacking flavor. Looking forward to trying the chili lime.

review/summary: Spicy, limey, popchips.
review/text: The Chili Lime popchips are a bit overwhelming. My friends said they couldn't really eat them by themselves, they taste better with a meal. However, I happily ate a whole bag just by itself, and it was fun.<br /><br />The chili (spicy) comes on strong at first, then you taste the lime, then it ends with a spicy limey aftertaste that is quite pleasant. This was my first time trying Popchips, and I loved eating them, the texture is great.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the size of the bags. It's like they are only half-filled, or the bags are twice the size they need to be. It makes it look like there is more in the bag than there is.<br /><br />Note that although these are '100 calorie' bags, each bag has 16 carbs. If you are on a low-carb diet, that eats up a large chunk of your daily serving, so beware! Because, like with most chips, you can't just eat one chip.

review/summary: DELICIOUS!
review/text: I don't much like sweet potatoes or things made with sweet potatoes, but these are really very good.  They have an unusual taste that is hard to describe.  It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.  The extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip.  I can't imagine anyone not liking Popchips, although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor.  Give it a try and you will most likely be hooked.

review/summary: Sweet Potato Popchips
review/text: Decent tasting snack.  Definitely has a sweet potato flavor, so if you don't like that vegetable, you probably won't like the flavor of these.  One bag (0.8 oz or 23 g) contains 19 chips, has 100 calories, 3 g of fat, 95 mg of sodium, and 45 mg of potassium.  That isn't bad compared to many other snack foods.  For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these "natural" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.  The first two ingredients are rice flour and sweet potato FLAKES.  The remaining ingredients are tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, and annatto (natural color).  They contain no fiber nor vitamin A, which I would expect to find in a sweet potato product.<br /><br />All in all, the Sweet Potato Popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods.  Obviously, something along the lines of an apple or some plain popcorn would be a healthier choice for a snack, but certainly would not be as enjoyable!

review/text: Put simply, these chips are full of flavor, texture and lower in calories than your average potato chip. They have a slightly salty but still sweet flavor. There's great "crunch" due to the fact that they have rice flour in them. They are not greasy since they are NOT fried. The only criticism is that they do not offer any significant fiber, being that the sweet potato is mixed with rice flour. I will absolutely purchase these as an alternative to a potato chip or a tortilla chip, for snacking.

review/text: Popchips are delicious!!!  We bought a variety pack.  I love the Salt & Pepper though all flavors are good (according to my husband since I can't have any dairy I did not try those flavors).  While the chips are high in sodium, they are a nice healthy alternative to grease and salt laden fried potato chips.  Don't expect a traditional potato chip or even a pressed chip like Pringles.  They are different but delicious.  A 0.8 ounce bag contains only 100 calories and 10% of your daily salt (2000 cal diet).  The bag says they start with a potato and "add a little heat and pressure and.. pop."  Well, not quite.  The ingredients list: Natural Potato Ingredients (Potato Flakes, Potato Starch), Safflower Oil and/or Sunflower Oil, Rice Flour, Sea Salt.  If you need gluten-free, they are gluten free BUT they are made on equipment shared with wheat.

All in all, these are great chips if you're watching your weight.  They are crispy and flavorful and much lower calories than regular chips.

review/text: I accidentally bought these chips (thought I was getting original pop chips), but have to say, because they are a little tart, I don't seem to be eating them as quickly, (good for my diet!).  If you like the taste of vinegar, you will like these.

review/summary: Yum!!!
review/text: Wow! is an understatement.  These are (by-far) the BEST barbecue potato chips on the market today -- and they don't have any non-food "junk" in them!  These chips taste like a cross between potato chips and barbecue pork rinds but they are low in fat and they are NOT fried!  They are really crunchy and we LOVE the barbecue seasoning that they use on these.  We're sold -- we won't be buying any of those "other" potato chips anymore. I've going to end this review now because I just heard one of my kids open up another bag...

review/summary: Cheddar POPCHIPS are totally Yummy!
review/text: I am addicted to Popchips - I love the cheddar flavored ones. I don't crave cheetos anymore which I was addicted to.  I know eat a bag of these and my craving is gone. They are actually healthy and for only 100 calories a bag and around 3 grams of fat - it is a much better choice than cheetos. They are very crunchy and full of flavor. I am ordering these again.

review/text: If you have not tried popchips, what are you waiting for?  They are the best.  Not baked or fried but low cal, lowfat and HIGH TASTE.  I have tried everything on the market and these are by far the best product out there of it's kind.  Guilt free snacks that are delicious are hard to come by.  This company has it down!  Every flavor rocks and new ones are coming soon!

review/summary: We'll never go back to "baked"!
review/text: These beat baked chips hands down! I love the crunch almost as much as I love the calorie content and the single serve bags! Because they are not fried you are saving fat and calories but they are not flat and tasteless like the baked chips either. You know the ones that if you bite off a piece the wrong way you can pierce your tongue with it? Never again! The BBQ is a tad strong IMHO but they are still keepers! The original flavor is awesome.

review/summary: A healthy alternative, but with overpowering and inconsistent flavor
review/text: These are definitely a healthier alternative than your standard potato chip - each bag (roughly 20 silver dollar-sized chips) has only three grams of fat and 100 calories. They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are "popped" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I was already a big fan of the Popchips Salt and Vinegar flavor, so when I saw that they were coming out with a Chili Lime flavor I was so excited to try it! The flavor does NOT disappoint - tangy, spicy, and a dash of sweet. This is my new favorite "chip"! Now, if you've never tried Popchips before, just be aware that the texture is different than regular potato chips, somewhere between a traditional chip and a rice cake. It can throw off die-hard potato chip fans, but if you just want something crunchy and awesome tasting, without as many calories and fat, then this is going to be your new favorite snack!

review/summary: Chili Lime Flavor Review
review/text: I love Pop Chips. Parmesan Garlic and Sour Cream and Onion Pop Chips rock my world. They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't. Interestingly enough the aftertaste is actually better than the intial flavor of the chip itself.<br />I'm not saying this flavor is bad, it's just not that good.<br /><br />Overall, great brand with great flavors in general but Chili Lime doesn't stack up against the others.

review/summary: Soooooo yummy and great texture!
review/text: OMG - these chips taste so good! I used to live in the UK and remember eating those delicious salt and vinegar chips. Flavor-wise these aren't as tart and vinegary as those, but they have a really nice twang to them that's not overwhelming, with some sweet/salty/savory overtones. Texture-wise these are light and airy. They are about 1/8 inch thick, like a mini rice cake though not as dense. They are great for dipping or eating all by themselves. The bag has just the right serving size. You don't feel too full afterward but they are definitely filling.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because even though they are natural, they aren't organic, and most non-organic potatoes are GMO (genetically modified), so maybe not totally healthy, but definitely delicious!

review/summary: Pop these chips...in your mouth!
review/text: Now the thought of a sweet potato chip might not initially appeal to everyone but I gave these a try and I am glad I did.  They are the right mix of sweet and salty so all those cravings get satisfied in one bite.  They are light and crispy.  If you have ever had a Muncho chip, they are similar in texture to those but not so salty like a Muncho.  You really don't get a strong sweet potato flavor and I at two small bags in one setting with ease.  They are low fat, low calorie (100 calories per bag which is a serving).  They contain natural ingredients like sunflower and safflower oil, sea salt, and organic yellow corn flour.  They are very very good.

review/summary: Popchips 5 Stars, Chili Lime Flavor 3 Stars
review/text: I have a bag of Popchips everyday with lunch. So needless to say I love Popchips. When I saw a new flavor available on Amazon of course I had to try it. Chili Lime sounded interesting, and it is indeed an interesting flavor. There is a big hint of lime along with the "chili" flavor which is hard to explain. I think this is one of those things that you just have to try for yourself if it sounds interesting. They're decent enough that I will finish off the box, but I can't say I would buy this flavor again.

review/text: I order Pop Chips through Amazon as none of my local stores carry the brand. I've tried a variety of the flavors they offer & all are very tasty, however, the sea salt & vinegar are by far my favorite. All I can say is....YUMMY.

review/summary: This stuff should be illegal!
review/text: Forget heroin...  Forget cocaine...  Forget meth...  NOTHING is more addictive than these "chips".  Heed these words: these "chips" will cause the downfall all modern civilization.<br /><br />In all seriousness, these things are very tasty, and nowhere near as bad for you as an old fashion potato chip.<br /><br />My wife picked up a small bag in an airport vending machine while on a trip.  She saved a few "chips" for me to try when she got home.  I was so impressed with the taste, and the nutrition label, that I immediately thought of my dad.  He loves a good snack item (don't we all?), but with a recent diabetes diagnosis, and the ever increasing challenge to lose a few pounds, his "snacking" options have been getting pretty sparse.<br /><br />So I shoot him a text message, and include a picture of the nutrition label from the back of the bag.  Seconds later I get a text message back:  "Are you kidding?  We're the reason Pop-Chips stock doubled last quarter!  Put all your stock into BBQ Pop-Chips. They will replace crystal meth soon!"<br /><br />Now, I haven't tried the other flavors yet.  If you look through the feedback on the other flavors, not all of them appear to be smash hits.  But you can't go wrong with Original.  Definitely give these things a try.  You won't be disappointed.
