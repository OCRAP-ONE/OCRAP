review/text: OVERALL, THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT!  THE TOMATOES ARE FABULOUS!!!  BEST CANNED TOMATOES I HAVE EVER HAD!  THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE PRODUCT IS THAT THE CANS ARE DENTED.  MY FIRST ORDER THERE WAS 'MAJOR' DENTING AND I DIDN'T USE THEM, BUT AMAZON MADE IT RIGHT FOR ME SO I ORDERED ANOTHER AND WHEN THIS BATCH ARRIVED THERE WAS ONLY MINIMAL DENTING ON TWO OF THE CANS.  SO OTHER THEN THE DENTING THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT!

review/summary: Well-balanced energy drink...
review/text: This drink tastes pretty good. It does have artificial sweeteners in it, even though you find it in stores that cater to "all-natural" shoppers. Maybe they should try a formula w/ stevia. The energy boost doesn't leave you w/ huge crash like Monster, etc. It does, however, get a little old taste-wise if you drink it all the time(like most low/zero calorie drinks). Good taste, nice boost, and low-calorie. Ka-ching!

review/summary: Deceptive and weird tasting anyways
review/text: Despite the "all natural" vibe the can emanates, the product is anything but. It's made with natural flavors and colors but then they hit you with Sucralose, and it has sugar anyways...please just use only cane sugar, the drink is much too sweet anyways. I am also disappointed that they only use 5% cherry juice. The other ingredients they use besides caffeine are in such minute quantities they will never accomplish anything. What's the point of including .01 mg of Flax Seed extract? I guess it looks good on the label. I'm surprised they had the balls to actually disclose the ridiculous fairy dusting of ingredients.<br /><br />On top of all this Bing has a very weird smell and aftertaste. The initial taste is mildly enjoyable, but overall it's a subpar energy drink. It can't hold a candle up to Guru energy.

review/summary: Not All Natural As Claimed
review/text: I took a chance on this product due to the fact I really like cherry juice flavor.  I skimmed over the reviews which were mostly positive but apparently not well enough to find out the actual contents of the product.  I drank about half the can until I realized something wasn't tasting right.  Then I looked at the ingredients and noticed it contained sucralose (Splenda) which is not something I except to find in a "all natural" drink.  I see no reason why they had to do this since it contains 10g of sugar anyway.  Why can't they just make a sugar-free version and keep that bad tasting artificial sweetener out of this version?  My next compliant is that it is only made up of 5% juice which isn't exactly a whole lot.  Both of these weren't mentioned (intentionally?) on the product description.  It is quite a shame because I think the taste of the product would have been pretty decent otherwise.  I think it is false advertising to say a product is "all natural and no artificial flavors" when it clearly isn't.

review/summary: Bing Mixology
review/text: I first bought Bing at a "Loaf & Jug" convenience store.  I liked the taste.  I don't get a kick from this like I do with Rockstar Sugar-free, but I think I'm sensitive to the artificial sweetners in the Rockstar which makes me feel more jittery than energized.  Bing is a mild energizer compared to other drinks, and doesn't really feel like a "crash" when it wears off.<br /><br />Mixology:  I use 1 cup of frozen berries and one can of Bing to make a berry smoothie pick-me-up.  I really enjoy this, sometimes adding a splash of orange juice, lemon juice, or lime juice to give the drink a little citrus bite.

review/text: I usually read the reviews but because I was impressed with the product description on Amazon I stupidly trusted the spin.<br />This so called all natural energy drink is a health hazard, make no mistake. They failed to mention that it has acesulfame potassium<br />which is aspartame. I don't think by mistake either because no heath conscious person would have ordered a chemical coctail<br />that is, surprise again, a non returnable product! Doubters just Google acesulfame potassium.

review/summary: Favorite energy drink
review/text: I used to drink rock star energy drinks, but they always left me crashing later. Bing is sold at the grocery store right next to where I work. I sometimes run over and buy one when I get a chance. The best part is that its only 40 calories per 12 oz can. It really does give you an energy boost to, but its more balanced and manageable. I feel like a tweaker when I drink other energy drinks and feel tired crappy later. Oh and it tastes great too!!! way better than rockstar. (unless you just don't like cherry)<br /><br />Pros: 40 calories, a balanced energy boost without a crash, delicious!<br />Cons: it can be kinda pricey, I would like to see this product sold in bulk at sams club or costco because I would buy it!<br /><br />In the grand scheme of things, energy drinks are just bad for you, but if you're going to drink one, it might as well be the healthiest and best tasting one.

review/summary: Bing Is Best Energy Drink
review/text: This 12 ounce Bing Energy Drink has great ingredients and is low in calories. First off there are only 40 calories in the entire 12 ounce can so it is a cross between a regular and diet energy drink. Where does it get its sweeting? It's got no high fructose corn syrup and not aspartame either, Bing actually is sweetened by cane sugar. Still only 40 calories. Awesome!  Three other ingredients also set this drink apart. One is Acai Berries which are a popular source of anti-oxidants. It also has flax seed oil which is a source of fiber and also beneficial in lowering cholesterol levels. The last is the Bing Cherry itself which is also an anti-oxidant and source of potassium which can help alleviate cramping for athletes.<br /><br />Bing contains 5% juice from black bing cherries.  Hence the name. The black bing cherry flavor is quite tasty and refreshing and the people at Bing did not skimp in the energy category either. With 120 milligrams of caffeine, 1000 milligrams of taurine, guarana seed extract, plethora of B-Vitamins and ginseng root extract this drink delivers a more than adequate kick. Although it is not among the strongest energy drinks out there it delivers plenty of kick to get you moving.

review/text: This review is for the drink itself, but not the delivery being offered if you buy it on amazon.  I'm lucky enough to live in Denver, where Bing is made, and have been drinking this product for several years now.  I work 12 hour night shifts, and I have a 9 month old son at home.  Sleep is definitely at a premium in my house.  To make matters worse, I've never been a coffee drinker.  I've tried most of the energy drinks on the market, and find they all have a medicinal aftertaste.  That's not the case with Bing.  It tastes like a carbonated cherry drink. Not only is it the best tasting energy drink I've ever tried, it's also the best tasting soft drink I think I've ever tried.  It helps energize me without a ton of sugar, it's only 40 calories, and has some vitamins in it.  What's not to love?  Thank you to Petey's for bringing this fantastic drink to the market and helping me get through long nights at work and then waking up early to spend time with my son.

I paid $6 for the 4pack I have right now.  Check the local stores (i got mine at a publix) and if you still cant find it, request it at your favorite store.  They would be more willing to carry it if they know someone will buy it.  Or, contact the manufacturer.  They should be able to tell you if it is distributed anywhere in your area.

review/summary: My Little Boy Loves Goldfish Colors.
review/text: My little boy (3 1/2 yrs. old) just loves Goldfish. I'm not sure where he got it, perhaps the grandparents. In any case, I have trouble with him in a little store I go to because they have a display of Goldfish cartons and we can't get by it without getting one. Any of you with kids probably understand. Well, now he loves Goldfish Colors and that probably also goes back to Grandpa. In any case, now Goldfish aren't good enough and Goldfish Colors are the only thing that will do. Fortunately, the store has some 6.6-ounce bags of them, so every time we're there we have to pick one up. Oh well, I enjoy Goldfish too so there's never any problem in getting rid of them. Personally, I grew up on Cheezits, but I like Goldfish just as well. Now I notice the Goldfish bag has a little notice in the upper left-hand corner that specifies the colors are from natural ingredients. That's good as I don't trust all dyes.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Good for YOU and Good for Children and FUN to EAT plus some NEAT-O TRICKS & TIPS!
review/text: Once again Pepperidge Farms has created a wholesome snack that is not only good for you but also good for children too; and a whole lotta fun to eat! Forget junk food when there's better food that's not only fun but wholesome and satisfying  but be careful; there are other "fisherpeople" out there who will raid your snack!<br /><br />Here's a bonus for those who were unaware - they are not "salty" like others are, plus for more specific info; you can always visit the Pepperidge Farms for they have various other products that are diabetic to heart healthy. Additional bonus is people who wear dentures won't die of embarrassment and enjoy the pleasure of munching on these beloved crackers. And those who have dental medical conditions by reason of medications or some type of genetic or health issues will also find these easy to eat as well - making them easier for Parents to Caretakers to monitor their loved ones or the ones they are overseeing.<br /><br />I also use these as Salad Toppers instead of hard croutons for a "Spring / Summer" fun - it adds spark and interest as well as contrast to your salad; even when entertaining ... who would have ever thought of tossing these precious yummies into salads? And plus, if you can't get your child to eat salad, they will when they see Pepperidge Goldfish in there swimming in cheese, lettuc, tomatoes - or even a Taco Salad to make Food interesting and introduction to healthy-eating to a child.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater (child) that just won't eat his/her veggies or just only specific types; try tossing a few Goldfish and sprinkle with cheese after cooking or steaming veggies and then at last minute toss in the fresh grated favorite cheese and some goldfish and toss; serve dinner immediately and observe after remarking that we're eating goldfish tonight that is swimming in our food.  (Leave it at that...) That is how I got my step-grandson to begin to eat other vegetables besides green beans, potatoes and corn. He was having too much fun playing and eating the veggies and "swimming" while eating at the same time that he forgot the rest of his dinner! *laughing*<br /><br />Thought I would toss an old trick I had done to my son when he was young, it still works... those Pepperidge Farm Goldfish are magical!

review/summary: Thin & crispy but too salty
review/text: I love blue corn tortillas and their products. I had been eating the Guiltless Gourmet brand Blue Corn Tortilla Chips for many years but ultimately found their chips a bit thick & bland. I decided to try out Garden of Eatin, and I am glad I did. Thinner and crispier than the GG brand with a richer blue corn flavor. If I didn't know they were baked, I'd think they were fried! My only complaint is the excessive salt which is super obvious on a dark blue chip. I just brush the extra salt off but this can be a pain. I'd buy a salt-free option if they offered it in their baked blue chips, but they only offer it in the fried blue chips. For now, these'll do. I like eating dipping them into my homemade, low-salt guacamole- YUM!!

review/summary: Too salty and nearly expired.
review/text: I ordered a case of these chips from Amazon because I like the regular Garden of Eatin blue chips and usually like baked chips better than fried.  I ordered a case (and put myself on subscription) to get the best price and figured I could eat a couple of cases a year.  But these chips are too salty - eating them actually burns my lips!  And all of the bags in the case I received from Amazon on January 5 have "best by" dates of February 3, 2010.  How am I supposed to eat 12 bags of too salty chips in less than a month?  Since Amazon does not allow returns on this item, I'll probably just donate my case to the food bank.  I highly recommend that before you order this item, buy a test bag at Whole Foods first.  And don't order a case unless you can use it within a month.  Learn from my experience!

review/text: These 1.5" rounds are cut too small for dipping, and may be too fragile for proper Tortilla dishes - so it's a shame I'm now stuck with a case of them.  considering the soy is at the end of the ingredient list after various oils and before the salt, then such soy is just a marketing gimmick to help excuse such a disappointing blue corn chip.  Target's Archer Farms Organic Blue Corn With Flax Seed Tortilla Chips - are much better and cheaper.  Thank you Amazon for double boxing this and sending out a 3 Month long dated product during a 50% off sale.

review/summary: Good, as long as they are still fresh
review/text: I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags....

review/summary: I love the sesame in these chips, you will too!
review/text: I love sesame in general. It makes foods more satisfying. There are two brands of blue corn sesame chips I know of; this one and one by Kettle. I think I might prefer the Kettle brand a little over this one since they use sprouted corn. Somehow that improves the flavor a little. These are still a 5 star product though. Sadly, I just searched for the Kettle chips and found they have been discontinued, so not only are these a great choice for sesame blue goodness they are your only choice!<br /><br />Of course chips like these are pretty high in fat, so it is not a good idea to eat them too often. They are quite addictive as well. For a little addition to a lunchtime meal you will not be disappointed. I hope you like them as much as I do.<br /><br />-Dan

review/text: I've been eating these chips with my lunch every day for over two years now. I love the taste first of all. Unlike two other black bean corn chip products I have tried (and more and more chip makers seem to be making black bean corn chips now), these are what they say they are: corn chips with black beans in them - - no lime or herb or any other kind of "flavor enhancer".<br /><br />I like the price of the chips here on Amazon. A 7.5 ounce bag sells for around $3 a bag, sometimes less when on sale.  Here, the case price works out to about $2.25 a bag,  - and delivery is free.

review/summary: The best corn chips out there
review/text: Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.  If you already know you like blue chips, get them here, as this price is unbeatable.

review/summary: The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization
review/text: Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet.  Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole "organic" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this "red hot" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.

review/text: I ordered these chips by accident. I meant to order "with added salt." I know, not a healthy choice but hey, I love salt! So, I ended up with a whole case of these unsalted chips. My wife said, hey these aren't salted! She was pleased. She worries about my diet. So, I had some chips. They're delicious! Good crunch. Very fresh corn flavor. Excellent with salsa. Sometimes a guy has to be wrong to do right!

review/summary: If you want fiber, don't buy!
review/text: I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips. But if the amount of fiber is what attracted you to them, don't buy!

review/text: I purchased these chips on October 18, 2010.  They were rancid/stale so you can certainly believe the other reviewers.  I had not noticed the reviews about the horrible taste and staleness of these chips.  I wish I had.  I contacted customer service for a refund which they approved but I think Amazon should either stop selling these chips due to such poor reviews or check their stock to make sure they are FRESH. If you order, you should order with caution.  I am trying another brand instead of reordering these.

The expiration date is not past when you receive your big box... but for some reason they are not fresh, and the salt on the chips is all at the bottom.  I kept thinking that it was "just that one bag..." but it was all of them.  I had eaten too many of them to send them back.  Do not buy this product from Amazon- but... my shipment may be the unlucky one that was stale- although i read several other reviews sharing my opinion... and i did not believe!

review/text: My first shipment of corn chips was rancid and absolutely inedible. That was very unfortunate because Garden of Eatin'chips can be very tasty. The Amazon vendor was no longer shipping so they were not replaced. I thought I was out the cost of a case of corn chips and still hungry.<br />  But...........<br />Upon hearing my concern, Amazon found a vendor and sent a new shipment at their cost next day. Those chips are absolutely perfect! Amazon's responsiveness, service and customer care is exceptional! Thanks Amazon for a superb customer experience and for renewing my faith in Garden of Eaten' Blue Corn Chips!

review/text: I have eaten the varieties of these for years and appreciate the concept- organic, not over salted, good varieities, etc.<br /><br />But more and more often, whether purchased here or in the store, in all varieties, the chips come with a sharp odor and flavor that to more suggests that rancid oil was used.  Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes terrible, and I am sick of wondering if I am eating something that has gone bad- and rancid oils are really bad for you, which defeats the purpose of this product. I can return them to a store but not to Amazon.  This is still a huge pain and not something that anyone should have to do.  I had to throw out a whole case of sesame blues from Amazon, which is a bad deal at any price. I am done with your rancid products.

review/summary: Regular tortilla chips.  Not flavorful.
review/text: I have noooo idea what the "blech" titled review is about.  My bag is not spicy at all, and the chips definitely don't taste bad. They were not too crunchy either.  In fact they are almost plain regular chips.  No big pizzaz here.  I was sad about that.<br /><br />I was actually really hoping for something limey! And Spicy! But don't expect that here.  I've almost gone through a whole bag, and maybe 1% of the bites have a hint of lime?  Zero bites have had a hint of chili.  99% taste like regular unflavored tortilla chips.  Well...a suuupppper small hint of flavor.  I'm almost wishing I had bought the pico de gallo instead.<br /><br />Basically, if you've been eating any chili-lemon flavored cheetos, completely wipe your memory and expectations- nothing that bold and tangy here.  (Which can be good and bad, my hubby hated the cheetos chili-lemon unspicy flavor and was worried we'd get that here, so he's happy we didn't.  I was looking forward to getting that popping taste, and am sad that wasn't there.)<br /><br />** WARNING: If you've never ordered full size bag of chips from amazon, be warned, 12 bags is A LOT!!! I opened the box and my jaw almost dropped, cause I don't know what I'm going to do with all the bags.  I'm sure they'll disappear at parties though.  (I had ordered mini 2oz bags from Amazon, and with those, the bulk amount is more manageable.)<br /><br />** Also, to make you feel good...I was at Ralphs shopping and one bag of 'Garden of Eaten' chips cost $5.39.  I think it was jalapeno cheese, and that's all they had, but regardless, I felt so good that I got the same thing for about $1.25 a bag (yea Amazon had it on sale). Yippy :-)<br /><br />** Chips were not stale, chipped or smashed on arrival, in case you're wondering.  And expiration date (on my on sale ones) is in about 4 months.

review/text: Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work.

review/text: I tried these chips about 4 years ago before the blue corn tortilla chips were popular. The second I finished eating one chip I knew I would be a customer for life. These are absolutely amazing. I wish all of the ingredients were organic but i won't be too picky. The 12 bags are quite a bit to get in one order but it is much cheaper than getting it at a local store. If you like to entertain these would be a good idea to keep handy for a more healthy option for your guests. I love these little guys. I would recommend to anyone.

review/text: If they were not on sale, I wouldn't have bought them, having tried other brands of "guac-a-mole" flavored tortilla chips.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  The taste is hard to describe - somewhere between gasoline and garbage, neither of which I've ever actually ingested, but which these chips brought to mind by taste and smell.  How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) "new look, same great taste" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the "Mad-Men" era I grew up in.

They have a great flavor and the perfect amount of salt. My only complaint is that this last case we recieved, the chips are so fragile! They are breaking really easily, they are not holding up to any amount of dipping, which is a bummer. I'll still buy these chips, I'm just not as pleased with them as I have been in the past. Perhaps it was just an odd batch, as they haven't always been this way.<br /><br />We have bought several flavors of Garden of Eatin chips and this brand is a winner, overall. Definitely our favorite corn chip brand!

review/summary: Vegan Natural [Organic Corn] Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. Kosher Parve. Made with organic yellow corn; canola, safflower, or sunflower oils [all organic and/or conventional]; and sea salt. Great choice for those who like corn chips like Fr*tos. Great with bean burritos, enchiladas, soups, and even as a crunchy salad topping. Like most chips, highly caloric. 170 calories per 1oz/28g serving. Use as a garnish, repackage in smaller snack bag sizes, or eat in moderation. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.

review/summary: No salt added!
review/text: I love this product very much. Normally, chips are too salty for me. This product is just perfect. I like to eat it without any sauce to enjoy its natural great flavor.

review/summary: Great Flavour - Excellent Find!
review/text: I've been hunting for snacks which taste good, but don't have BHA,BHT,EDTA,hydrogenated (partially or otherwise) fats, artificial colors and a myriad of other ingredients which are known to be "bad" yet they are still allowed in food production.  I can't express how excited I was to find these!  My husband is a very picky snacker - he loves these.  My children one which likes spicy and one which doesn't (third is too young for this kind of food) love these.  They are great straight out of the bag or as an accompaniment to a sandwich or bowl of chili.<br /><br />I initially found these in our local PCC and Whole Foods.  I'm glad Amazon carries them.  Price wise I'm saving at least $1.00/bag by buying through Amazon instead of from my grocery.
