review/summary: Freeze Dried Beef Liver
review/text: I have been giving the Stewart's Pro-Treat Freeze Dried Beef Liver to my maltipoo named Elvis Lee for many years now along with his daily meals.  It is all PURE Freeze Dried Beef Liver which provides him with protein since he is a very active boy who likes to go for long walks and play ball!  Elvis Lee is very particular about what he likes and this Freeze Dried Liver is on his list of FAVORITES!!

review/text: My two boxes absolutely LOVE these freeze dried liver treats; it is one of their favorites.  Both dogs do their kidney bean dances in the kitchen when we take the lid off.  The only bad thing is the treats are small and they only recommend a few daily.  (But, I guess that's not too much of a bad thing given these are a little pricer than the average dog treat)

The sizes are quite variable which is ok.<br /><br />The product arrived with no protective covering on either the outside of the tub or under the lid which bothered me a bit (not sure if they had been open, returned by someone, then sent to us) so that is why I rated 3 stars.<br /><br />The amount of product for the price is great!<br />I would most likely purchase again.

review/summary: Great treat to use as a high value reward!
review/text: My 4 month old aussie loves these! Whenever he's fixated on something (like another dog while we're on a walk), I quickly wave it near his head to redirect his attention. It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA. It has a May 2, 2014 expiration date printed on the underside of the container.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!

review/summary: This it like dog heroin.  There's nothing my dog won't do for liver treats.
review/text: I've been using Freeze Dried Liver treats to train and reward my dogs for about 20 years.  It is like dog heroin for my dogs, there is nothing they won't do for these treats.  It makes training a breeze.  My current dog, Samson, will sit in front of the pantry and drool until I give him a treat.  The treats are expensive so I cut them in quarters so they last longer.  These are 100% meat, no scrap or filler.  These are the only treats I give Samson, my Rottweiler.  You can't go wrong with these treats.

review/text: These are a great deal when compared to the small bags of treats available at the pet store. More importantly, my dog adores them. I use them as an extra special treat, usually just for when he goes into his crate. As soon as he notices that I have one in my hand, he runs to his crate and waits, tail wagging. The only downside is that the liver cubes smell horrible (to humans, anyway) and leave a powdery residue behind. But as some other reviews have noted, the powder is great for sprinkling on dry food for a finicky dog.

review/summary: Great treat, but probably not for small dogs
review/text: These treats are similar to the PureBites, however, since I have small dogs (Peke mix), I generally don't give them these snacks because they are more suited for medium and large dogs (or small dogs with large mouths). Smaller dogs have a hard time biting down on them and there is the possibility of choking because the pieces are too large and dense for their small mouths, so I have to break them up into smaller pieces before I give them to my doggies. The PureBites, on the other hand, are flatter and easier for them to chew. The snacks appear to made in the same way, so if I had larger dogs, I would give them either this snack or the PureBites.

The fact that the pieces are irregular is not a drawback and is not surprising.  I do cut up the larger pieces as I don't want to give them too much at once.  The prospect of getting one of these treats makes them much more receptive to training and just coming when you call.  Also, we find the largest size very economical as you don't pay for shipping.

review/text: My 2 year old German Shepherd loves this treat.  I keep it on my counter as a quick and handy treat for "mini, spontaneous training sessions".  The only issue I have is that most of the treats are a bit big and difficult to break into smaller pieces which is necessary for obedience classes where we go through many treats.  Therefore, I do not use these treats for that purpose.  (The container recommends only 3-4 cubes per day for large dogs).  Having said that, they are an excellent treat for occasional use and I would highly recommend them.

review/text: By far this treat is the best one that I have bought.  We used it to crate train out puppy and whenever he saw us going for the bucket or smelled it being opened he would run for his crate and sit in there until we gave him this treat.  The large bucket is the most economicay, but it does have a really strong odor when you open it; for that reason we always keep a small ziploc with the treats in it that we use regularly and only open the bin to refill that bag.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the sizes of the treats varies incredibly - but if one is too large we just split it, we will give 2 of the small ones, and the powder and bits at the end just go in his dinner one night for an added treat!

review/text: After exhaustively researching dry dog foods for our Great Dane and Black Lab, we decided on this one.  No by-products, fillers, or useless protien. Eagle Pack would possibly be a better choice, but not by much - and the price is significantly higher.  This food can be harder to find (the big box pet stores won't carry it) but you can locate stores in your area on the manufacturer's website if you'd rather not buy on-line.  I HIGHLY recommend this food.

It's quite the eclectic list of ingredients here...<br /><br />First, they have 4 meat products to start the product, which is among the best you will see anywhere. The grains they use afterwards are the types we like to see, such as rice and oatmeal. There aren't any cheap fillers like corn, soy or wheat.<br /><br />There are potatoes for a high-quality carb source, and eggs for further protein. Duck and salmon are somewhat far down the list, but they only add to the variety of meat sources in this food. Plus, look at the fruits and veggies: carrots, peas, apples, tomatoes, blueberries and spinach. It's hard to beat that.<br /><br />All of this in a food that is VERY reasonably priced!

review/text: My vet @ 183 Animal Hospital in Irving, TX is totally fine w/ this food.  They sell Science diet but what he says about Chicken Soup is "That's a very good food, nothin' wrong with that!"  Meatball and Zippo's coats have become shinier and they LOVE the stuff!  Been eating it for 3+ years.  My vet is very happy w/ their health.  He says he wishes his teeth were in good as shape as both my kids.  But I attribute some of that to "flossing".  They play pull-toy every day and I'm sure that, along w/ a good diet has a lot to do w/ it.  They also get supplemental anti-bacterial fluid for their water bin.<br /><br />Read the ingredients.  Some dogs have allergies to some ingredients so not all dogs can eat all things.  Mine most certainly benefit from Chicken Soup.  I am going to see if my feed store sells the canned version so the kids can get some real meat on a regular basis other than the incidental chicken, turkey or beef portions from my kitchen.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!

When our family hit some tough financial times, I began looking for a good food that would be a better fit with our budget. This food absolutely fits the bill.  My golden retriever mix is not crazy about it, but that doesn't bother me that much--he's a good weight, and he will eat it when he's hungry.  He's had some allergy issues in the past and I was sure this food would kick them into gear, but it didn't--after fully transitioning to this food he has not gotten itchy at all.  I'm definitely going to stick with Chicken Soup... why pay twice as much on dog food if you don't have to?

review/text: Kibble is a, "complete & balanced" recipe...look for that when YOU purchase kibble.  Very important words, stated by DR. EDELL. It's written on the packaging.  This kibble is well made and my dogs love it.  It is unknown to many pet owners but once the word's out, the price will probably go up.  I rate it 5 stars.

review/summary: Cured dogs' bad skin
review/text: After years of watching my older miniature schnauzer, Cosmo, suffer very bad itching, especially along the back, and starting to see the younger one get it too, it was truly a blessing to find this product which pretty much brought an end to their itching.<br />I've almost forgotten the sound of the chair hitting the table as Cosmo steps back and forth with his back under the chair's lower horizontal wood planks -scratching all of his hair off, and eventually his skin, but I still have pictures of the bloody red patches.<br />Thank you, Chicken Soup, for making a healthy natural product that doesn't give my dogs terrible skin reactions.

review/summary: First food my dog doesn't care for
review/text: I tried this for the first time recently. My budget was tight, but I was not willing to feed my dog "junk" food, so after some searching, "CSDLS" seemed like the most bang for the buck. The sales person advised me to buy a smaller bag before diving into the 35 pounder to make sure my dog would eat it. I chuckled and told him my dog has never met a food she doesn't like...until now. Now mind you, I have a lab. Labs love food and will eat just about anything. This is the first food that she is not excited to eat. :( She will eat it just b/c she's starving, but it's with much less enthusiasm. She even stops eating after a few bites, walks away, and then reluctantly finishes. She has never done this in her life. It's too bad. I was hoping she would like this, but now it's back to the more expensive brands.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods RECALLED
review/text: Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

review/summary: Read Review , Great food
review/text: I have a 6 year old cocker spaniel who has had horrible ear infections and very dry and coarse fur. I fed her buffalo blue for awhile, but when it would get to expensive, I would go back to 365 dog food or even crap like Purina. Her ear infections were so bad, I was putting drops in her ears 3 times a day. Also, her fur was disgusting. Mind you, my dog did not have any health problems or gross fur until the last year. Anyways, a local pet food supplier recommended Chicken Soup for the Soul dog food and it was affordable so I decided to try it, not expecting much, but figured she would be healthier. Three bags later and her ear infections have COMPLETELY cleared up. Not only that, her hair is back to it's soft and healthy coat. I can't believe it! I am truly impressed and happy! This just clarifies for me how much eating right can effect your health. While I have pretty good eating habits, I'm tightening them up even more after seeing the results of this food.

review/summary: Excellent food, excellent value
review/text: We adopted a 2.5 year old Landseer Newfoundland after our 7 year old Newfoundland passed away earlier this year. The breeder of our two Persian cats had recommended this food to me for the cats and had switched all her cats and her Shar Peis (which she also breeds) to this food. I ordered for the cats and accidentally ordered the dog food instead, so it was ready for him when we brought him home. He had been fed Purina before with his old owners. Otis loves the food and his coat is ridiculously shiny. Newfies are notorious for shedding, especially in warm climates where we live, and while he still sheds, it's very little. I reordered for our cats as well, and we are putting them back on Science Diet. One of the cats is an orange and white Persian, and his coat on the Science Diet had been so full and beautiful, and with the change to this food, he shed more than half his coat and the orange is now more of a beige and he looks much more white, but they love the food and there were no other issues. They are actually shedding less, and while they both get baths every month to help with shedding and dander, the food made their coats very soft and silky. We just prefer big fluffy cats, so this food will continue with our dog only! Love the free shipping right to our door--very convenient as well. And for anyone wondering, the stool volume when you go to any higher end food is a lot less in any animal. That is a big plus with a dog over 100 lbs!

review/summary: I wouldn't buy any dog food made by Diamond (chicken soup is only one of many)
review/text: Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the "voluntary" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through "other" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all.

They are sticky on the fingers and are definitely chewy, a desirable quality in a chewy bar.<br />This is a deceptive product however. Almond pieces are far down in the list of ingredients and not easily found in the bar itself. Like strawberries? Look elsewhere for your strawberry fix because there are no strawberries in this bar, not even a sliver or seed. Instead one gets strawberry flavored bits of cranberry.<br />Call me crazy, but the lack of strawberries in something called oats and strawberry rubs me the wrong way.

But these strawberry ones are so horrible, I literally gave them away at work. The taste is very artificial, and as someone else said the taste is "off".. Why did they drizzle chocolate on top too?  I don't think this is their standard chocolate that they put in the other bars, it too tastes bad..  It also has a horrible aftertaste.  I definitely don't recommend these at all.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I don't know why these bars aren't more popular.  They're delicious.  They're sweet and fruity -- satisfying, tasty, and keeps things "movin".  I mean, yes, all the rules of FiberOne still apply.  They're not THE BEST for you (they're not organic, and have sugar added) and if you're not used to eating high-fiber foods, they could make you a gassy.  But if you know and like FiberOne bars and enjoy fruity bars, I think you'll be very pleased with these.  I have one for breakfast or lunch (or, not and) and it hits the spot.  I like all of the FiberOne flavors, but this one is my favorite.

review/summary: High fiber isn't necessarily a good thing!
review/text: I recently cut fiber one bars out of my diet after I noticed that I get all the fiber I need in a day just by eating whole wheat bread, fruits, vegetables and nuts. If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a "healthy" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision. (And so are my friends!)

review/summary: Odd favor
review/text: Other reviewer is right. The flavor is odd (elderberry flavored cranberry pieces). Not what the palete is expecting when it thinks it is getting strawberry. They are pretty the same way waxed fruit is and just as inedible. All the fiber one bars have an odd raw flour flavor that is a little adjustment at first. The chocolate and caramel are very good. This one is for the birds. From seeing what they left on my car, a little fiber would be helpful.

review/summary: Fiber products
review/text: After I had a colonscopy, I was informed that I had diverticulosis.  I was told that more than half the population develops this condition because most people do not have sufficient fiber in their diet, which should be about 30 grams per day.  Diverticulosis can become a potentially hazardous condition called diverticulitis and if not reversed may require surgery.  One day while grocery shopping, I saw Fiber One and Kellogg's fiber bars, tried them and put myself on a three-a-day ration.  Actually, I'm doing this more for medicinal purposes than for taste.  I do like the bars, however, and they're a great replacement for dessert and/or sweet tooth. Now I'm ordering different flavors every three months in bulk (it's cheaper).  It took my body about six weeks to become accustomed to the increased fiber, but well worth it.  The bars do produce a lot of intestinal gas, so one needs to start introducing the added fiber slowly and then try to maintain a goal of 30 grams a day.

review/summary: Good Source of Fiber
review/text: When I first received my order I was a little disappointed with the barley size, they all kind of small.  But after I cooked it, the size actually doesn't matter.  I ususlly make barley soup or mix with rice.  It's good for making risotto too.  When I cook it with rice, I take 3cups of rice, 1cup of barley and use water for cooking 4cups of rice, set my rice cooker for at least 2~3 hours timer.  The taste is great and I love the texture of barley.  My kids will eat this rice mix without complain.  It gives you a lot more fiber compares with just eating rice. I keep my barley in freezer.

review/text: This may be not the best deal, but it is very convenient get groceries delivered to your door. Cooking instructions are somewhat OK, but if you like barley to be little softer I would suggest soaking it for about 3 hours before cooking. Set you fire to the lowest and let it simmer until most of the water is gone. Add some butter or margarine and you got yourself nice "kasha"

review/summary: Great price, great grain!
review/text: I mainly use pearled barley in soups and stews.  It adds a chewy wholesomeness, extra fiber and healthy amounts of niacin, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese and selenium.  I just add 1/2 to 1 cup of barley to the boiling stock as I cook.  It also makes a great side dish when seasoned and served as you would wild rice.<br /><br />Arrowhead Mills pearled barley is a great value - I love that it comes in 6 28-oz bags. It works out to $1.57 per pound, and even less if you sign up for Subscribe & Save.  I keep one bag in a kitchen canister for daily use, and store the others in a ziplock bag in my pantry (to protect against moisture and insects).

review/summary: Cure for Acid Reflux and Gerd
review/text: I have been using Pearl barley almost a year.  Arrowhead mills is one of the best quality.<br />In the beginning I started making Barley water for my first drink in the morning as recomemded by Dr.OZ.  Ir helps in starting a weight control diet.  The greeks used barley water mix for their soliders in anient times and the Vitamins and minerals make it a health food.  It is alkaline - it will help settle your acid reflux.  My wife has had on and off acid reflux and recently had to go to the ER over acid reflux.  They could do nothing.  I started her on Barley water - made form boiled Barley.  The only thin added was Truvia because she is a sweet tooth. Every thing must taste sweet for her. It worked.  Last week she made me call the ambulance to the ER.  I knew this was part real and part diet and part getting over emotional panic! Of couse they could not find anything. My moter had a great doctor in New Jersey who to say you could solve most health problems by examing every thing that you did and the food that in your mouth. Stop drinking carbonated water and drink Barley water first thing in the morning and when you have a problem. The barley water got me off diet soda which makes gain weight by stimulating your insulin production by 10 more times the normal. Spenda is 10 to 12 times sweeter than sugar. MY wife's Gerd is much better.<br />She now uswe our juicer to add fresh apple juice(replacing the Truva) to the barley water and natural raw honey both are alkaline.  No more GERD or acid reflux.

review/summary: Good quality juice at a really good price
review/text: I've used Festival lemon juice for several years - ordered right here on Amazon.  In the last year I've seen the price go up and up even in the grocery stores.  I was really happy to find this 4 gallon pack, since we use a lot of lemon juice and this will last us a year or so. I use it in seltzer water as a drink - Lemon juice becomes alkaline when consumed, which is good for our immune system, helps with weight loss and boosts energy levels. I also use lemon juice when canning or dehydrating potatoes, apples, or bananas since the citric acid keeps them from turning brown.<br /><br />I used Subscribe and Save to get free shipping and 15% off the purchase price, bringing it down to $8.40 per gallon.  I've paid that much for a quart of it in the grocery store!<br /><br />Festival brand also tastes good - not bitter like some store brands.  I'll keep the open gallon in our spare fridge with the milk and pickles, and store the rest on the pantry shelves.

review/summary: Great Product - but scratch and dent!
review/text: I give my two small dogs a spoon of pumpkin every night - the vet recommended it and they love it!  The quality and taste of this product seems to be fine for them - they eat it without complaint.  However, the issue is that more than half of the cans were SEVERELY dented.  Since the box was intact and whole, the cans were clearly already in this condition when placed in the box and shipped.  Because of the degree of denting on the cans, I could only safely use about 2/3 of the package.  Big picture - great product but you are being shipped cans the store won't sell because of the denting.  If you can accept that not all cans will be usable, this is good product.  But I was disappoint by the condition of the cans and will not repurchase this item.

review/summary: Great Product & No Dented Cans!
review/text: I have 2 poodle mixes and they had soft poop lately, so I tried giving them probiotics.  It didn't help.  So I tried giving them 1 tablespoon of this with each meal and now they are SUPER regular in their bowel movements and their poop has firmed up.  I don't even have to walk them for them to poop anymore!  They just go in the backyard.  Trust me these two rarely pooped in the backyard before I started giving them the pumpkin.  I do have a plastic dog can lid which I like to use to keep the fresher (at least I like to think so!).  None of my cans were dented.<br /><br />**TIP** I decided to give my dogs 1/2 tbpn since they are 15-20 lbs.  Since I can't use the whole can up in 3 days as recommended by the can, I used the 1/2 tablespoon to scoop little mounds onto a small cookie sheet, froze them in the freezer and then put the frozen scoops into a freezer zip lock bag for storage in the freezer.<br /><br />**UPDATE 4/25/12** My dog with the sensitive stomach, his poop got soft again even though I was giving him the pumpkin every meal.  So, now I added 2 tbspns of rice, and that's hardened up his poop.  I'll keep testing with different ratios of rice and pumpkin mixed with his canned dog food till I find the perfect output. Hahaha.

review/summary: severely dented and unusable
review/text: Because my local store wasn't carrying pumpkin yet for the holidays and I really needed it for my dogs, I took a chance ordering this product online. Twice I ordered out of necessity and was twice disappointed. Both times, most of the 12 cans in the box were so severely dented that I couldn't trust that it was safe to feed to my dogs. I would have never bought them if they were on a store shelf in that condition. The cans were not damaged in shipping, because the outer Amazon box was fine and the interior Nummy TumTum box was fine. Sadly, that means the dented cans were packed by the company itself, not damaged in transit.  My e-mail to Nummy Tum Tum's customer service about the condition of their product went unanswered/ignored. Why I gave the company a second chance I really don't know. I guess I naively thought the extent of the damage to the first batch must have been a fluke. I guess I also thought that the Nummy Tum Tum company would take more pride in its product than to ship the garbage they couldn't sell to customers buying them off the shelves to online customers who wouldn't go through the trouble of shipping them back. Boy, was I wrong. I was willing to give the product a chance, even a second chance, but dealing with this company was a big mistake. Buyer beware!

review/summary: Wonderful product
review/text: I'm so sorry to hear about the people who's had a bad experience with the dented cans.  My first order came out perfect! No dents and packed very well.<br /><br />In terms of the product, I couldn't be happier.  I first gave this to my shar pei, who has a very sensitive digestive system, in order to help him with his diarrhea. I use it as a supplement to his regular food, and mix it with rolled oats.  This might be a little TMI, but within a month of this supplement to his regular food, his diarrhea is gone! His poop has been solid and nothing the vet has prescribed has been able to do that on a prolonged basis.<br /><br />Note: I've tried the other pumpkins out there (non organic) because they were a bit cheaper...but it didn't have as good a result as the Nummy Tum Tums.<br /><br />Update: My second order of this product was a bit disappointing. 6 out of 12 cans were dented. Took away a star for that, because it's still a good product. I'm going to see what I can do about those six dented cans.<br /><br />Update 2: Amazon was fantastic and understanding about the dented cans. Thanks so much!  I've since ordered several more boxes (I order about one box a month as it is a daily supplement to my dog's meal) and have had no more dented can experience.

It is very clear that the cans were set into the box in this condition; this is NOT a packaging issue.<br /><br />Please note that this item is not returnable as per Amazon policy, but I did receive a prompt reply from Amazon that they would ship out a replacement order. I received the replacement lickety split and had to laugh because there came more dented cans, but not quite as bad as the first batch. Last night I opened the first can, tasted it and mixed some in to my cat's food. It was smooth and suprisingly sweet.She ate it! I then distributed the remains of the can into smaller portions in an ice cube tray to help it last.<br /><br />Overall, it appears to be a good product. I shared some cans with a human friend who makes pumpkin bread.  I haven't opened up the badly dented cans yet so I cannot report on the status of the product in those cans.

review/summary: Excellent product in perfect condition
review/text: I have used this product very successfully many times before (mixed in with Party Animal canned food as a topping on Acana kibble) when my dogs needed some extra fiber but I always bought it from a pet store. One of my dogs had diarrhea, and then the medication the vet prescribed plus the bland diet of white rice and boiled chicken promptly caused constipation. After 3 days of not "going" I knew I needed to get some pumpkin again. Since my work schedule this week was such that I couldn't make it to the pet store until the weekend and I didn't want to wait that long, I decided to check if Amazon might have it. I was pleasantly surprised to see that yes indeed they do, and at a much lower price than I had been paying (+ free shipping since I have the Prime membership). I was, however, turned off by the several negative reviews of the cans being shipped severely dented. At the end I decided to order anyway, figuring that I can always return the defective cans. Well, I am glad I did! My order arrived the next day, and every single can was in perfect condition - not a scratch or the tiniest dent on any of them - with expiration date Sept. 2014. I am stocked up and ready for the next tummy trouble. (Oh, and since it contains nothing else but 100% organic pumpkin, I have also used it to make pumpkin pancakes for us humans. Delicious! :-)

review/summary: Used to be high quality, now it's questionable
review/text: I used to love this product. I have purchased at least 10 cases over the last year or two. I am less impressed with the quality now and even a little concerned. Hopefully the manufacturer will read this review and be motivated to fix the problem. If not, I will continue to buy the Farmer's Market pumpkin from Target as it is made the right way and costs less.<br /><br />I manage a holistic rescue and boarding sanctuary. If you've ever been in pet rescue/boarding or taken a dog swimming at the beach, you know it is essential to have something that will stop diarrhea quickly. All canned/powdered pumpkin will stop diarrhea caused by saltwater ingestion or diet changes. This product works as well as any but now that this manufacturer is using pumpkins which aren't ripe, the product is less nutritious and harder to feed. Instead of a creamy consistency that will coat kibble, it is now thick and doesn't mix in well. Sometimes it's harder than others but I am notcing an overall trend of less-desirable product. Maybe Amazon is getting the reject product from the manufacturer and not explaining this to the consumer. The Nummy Tum Tum 100% Organic Pumpkin Puree should not be trusted to provide the vitamins that are in regular canned pumpkin. Only a product that is deep orange and mushy is made from ripe pumpkins and will provide the nutrients which are assumed to be in "pumpkin". Don't be fooled by yellow, firm pumpkin, it's not ripe.<br /><br />Lastly I want to add that two of my cases have contained badly dented cans that were dented prior to being packed in the box. That is just plain rude.

review/text: Dog woofs this stuff down and I was surprised to like it as well. No dents or expiration date issues. All cans lacked rust or any sign of being the slightest bit aged. Great bargain.

review/summary: yum pumpkin
review/text: I use pumpkin to help with my dogs' digestion - the fiber in pumpkin was recommneded by my vet.  It has worked like a charm for the past year.  Problem is finidnig canned pumpkin outside of the holiday baking season - so it's pricey in terms of the shipping costs.  But I only give them about a tablespoon on their food once a day so it'll last a long time.

review/summary: Comes out of the can like a brick!
review/text: This is nothing like the any organic pumpkin I have ever purchased.  It is dry and hard when it comes out of the can.  It actually is affecting the stools of my dogs in a negative way.  Will never buy it again.  I will pay more for the good stuff.

review/summary: Pure Pumpkin for ALL your pets!
review/text: While the label on the cans reads, "For Dogs", Nummy Tum Tum Pet Products (Pure Organic Pumpkin and Pure Organic Sweet Potato) are safe for ALL your pets.<br /><br />I began using Nummy Tum Tum because my Persian cat refuses anything but dry Royal Canin products, and he was constantly constipated. I read about using organic pumpkin to add fiber to the diet, so I tried Nummy Tum Tum's organic pumpkin and we have had "smooth sailing" ever since.<br /><br />No, my cat will not eat the pumpkin voluntarily, so part of the morning ritual is feeding him 1 tablespoon (1 tbs. per 10 lbs. weight) through a syringe. For the moment's inconvenience the cat experiences, it is well worth relieving him of rock hard stools.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who has any type of pet with constipation problems.<br /><br />Nummy Tum Tum's new look now includes the label on their website to read, "FOR ALL YOUR PETS".

review/summary: It's hard to understand....
review/text: how the packer gets the pumpkin to such a weird consistency.  Pumpkin is loose, and soft, right?  Not Nummy Tum Tum.  It's hard enough to slice...sort of like a huge amount of corn starch has been added.  And, what makes it pumpkin "for dogs," if it is 100% pure pumpkin?  Let me just say that I doubt I could make a pumpkin pie, out of it.<br />I purchased two cases. The dog seems to think it's okay, if I drip a fish oil capsule over it.

review/text: I have read all the reviews. I don't think I will order The pumpkin for dogs.I can't trust cans that have dents and damaged. I love my pets to much to take a chance on their health .I will stick with human- grade pumpkin . Not pumpkin that is for dogs . Please people give me a break. That is just a way to make you think you are doing a good thing for your pet .It's second grade food.

review/summary: Pumpkin for my dog
review/text: While I've read some really positive things about giving your dog pumpkin, it didn't work for me. My dog hated the pumpkin so I had to mix it with wet good chunks. In fairness he hates all pumpkin, not just this brand. I did this for two weeks of pumpkin and wet food each morning. I gave my 7 lb dog two table spoons daily. Less scooting but I still had to get his anal Gladstone expressed and they were full. Maybe I'll try coconut next.
