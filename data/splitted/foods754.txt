review/text: Teddy Grahams are soooo delish, they are what a chocolate graham should be. The ones I received were expired, but Amazon worked with me to find a resolution. This issue would not prevent me from ordering them again; Amazon is one of the friendliest, most customer oriented and easiest online or brick and mortar retailers period.

review/text: My kids LOVE these things. They are so convenient too.  I really like to order from Amazon, because it is so convenient... but watch the price on these little babies. I originally bought these in Sept 2011 for under seven dollars. 2 months later the price is over 14. Really?! I can appreciate inflation, but this kind of price increase is robbery!

review/text: Chocolate Teddy Grahams are so yummy!  As an adult, I love them.  I'd imagine kids would too.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- No high fructose corn syrup.<br />- Crunchy little bite-sized cookies.<br />- Nice chocolate taste that's not fake.<br />- Great to eat in the car, at your desk, or wherever.  It's a portable snack.<br />- Sweet but not sickeningly so.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I really have no cons other than they will get stale if you don't wrap the bag up tightly.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I enjoy Chocolate Teddy Grahams as either dessert, or a snack with a cup of coffee.  It's a sweet pick-me up that doesn't leave me feeling too guilty.  Cures the need for chocolate, and has a nice crunch that sometimes I really want.  Oh yeah, and they're cute little bears!

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: Well I just finished my first can and ordered more.  The nonfat stuff you buy in a cardboard box at the supermarket is just plain disgusting tasting-even mixed into sauces or with chocolate sauce added. So I thought maybe this whole milk powder might taste better. Night and day! This stuff is delicious-even just drinking as milk. I don't even use this as a "survival" food. I keep a can in the fridge (I don't know if that's required, but I feel if you can, it probably stays fresh longer) and I use it for all my milk needs, rather than buying a jug of milk and then throwing 1/3 away when it goes bad. I use this for sauces, in cereal, soups-in fact anywhere I want to use milk. And it is, as another reviewer put it: "yummy" stuff.

review/text: I absolutely love these rice snacks.  My husband bought himself a bag and I snuck a few just to try them and finished the whole bag!  I wish they came in a larger bag but I will continue to buy the smaller ones.  Sometimes our grocery store has them on sale for $1 which is perfect.  There is also garlic and onion powder but it's not overpowering in my opinion. I am trying to watch my weight and this is a great alternative to chips with sandwiches. I think they are definitely worth a try for all.

review/summary: The taste is more like onion and garlic than sea salt and black pepper
review/text: I love sea salt and black pepper on just about everything -- popcorn, baked potatoes, chips, everything!  So when I saw these I had to order them -- they are reasonably low in calories, and I figured they'd make a good snack (not fried, not greasy, and the sea salt and black pepper would avoid the chemical taste found in some of the other flavors of this product).<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong!  While there is a subtle taste of black pepper, it's actually more of a background flavor.  What you taste first is the oniony/garlicky powdered substance that coats the little rice cakes.  If there's sea salt in there, it's completely overwhelmed by the onion/garlic flavor.<br /><br />I have no clue why these things are covered in onion/garlic powder.  Nowhere on the label does it mention onion or garlic, but it does say (in pale-colored type), "Flavored with OTHER NATURAL FLAVORS" (the capital letters are theirs) and onion powder and garlic powder are listed in the ingredients on the back of the bag.  Had I known this, I would not have ordered them.<br /><br />Generally, I like rice cakes.  They are crispy and light, and they satisfy that urge for something crunchy that hits you every now and then.  The cheddar cheese flavor isn't bad -- a bit too much of the orange powdery substance that is supposed to be cheese, but I like cheese and it's no where near as irritating as the stuff that's sprayed on Cheetos or Doritos.  Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of garlic powder or onion powder, so there was no way these were going to work for me.<br /><br />I would have given these one star (since Amazon won't allow NO stars!), but my husband does like them, so I figured I'd go with two stars.  But there's no excuse for not making it clear on the front of the bag that these are ONION & GARLIC Rice Snacks!  That's not cool, Quaker!

review/summary: Quakes-sea salt and cracked black pepper
review/text: I am a big fan of Quakes as they are low in calories and pack a mean flavor punch. I usually stick with the cheddar cheese flavor because they are my favorite, but my local store was having a sale to benefit the USO, so I bought 10 bags of different flavors. This was one of the new ones I am trying out. I have to say that my first rice cake was extremely like a sour cream and onion flavored potato chip, which I don't mind at all because I like that flavor- I was just not expecting it! There is definitely a onion-y powder used in this. I found it to be nice and subtle throughout the serving. I like to keep myself at 10 rice cakes per serving, and the first rice cake was heavily flavored, while the rest imparted a more pepper and salt type of flavor, with the onion as a side note. I suspect the reason for the first cake seeming so powerful is because it was the first to hit my palate, and not because of over powdering. As the palate acquires the onion flavor, it will bring itself down. This is my observation anyway.<br /><br />Overall, I was not expecting much from the flavor, but was pleasantly surprised! I would recommend this to people who enjoy sour cream and onion flavored items. I am happy with this flavor.

review/summary: For RICE CAKE HATERS...
review/text: Thought I'd never eat anything with "rice cake" on the label...hated the whole concept since the 80's.<br /><br />However, they were sampling these at my Costco in Seattle and I hadn't eaten all day.  O.M.G. Delicious!  Lots of flavor, lots of crunch, mostly light and crispy but with some harder, crackly bits here and there which mixes up that texture a bit.  They have a really nice, lingering black pepper burn (don't be scared, it's about the equivelant of 1/2 star if you're thinking Asian food spice level)!<br />They apparently have a little garlic and onion flavoring, as well as yeast (nice umami quality) and there's some corn too, which probably explains the harder crunchy element.<br />The first ingredient is germless brown rice.<br /><br />Costco has them in 17oz bags for around $4 or so...can't remember exact price.<br /><br />Love them!

review/summary: One Of The Worst Food Items I've Ever Eaten
review/text: I saw many other flavors available, but I thought the sea salt and black pepper would be the minimalist choice as far as flavors went.  It fails to tell you that it also includes onion and garlic flavoring.  Don't get me wrong.  I season all of my meat with salt, cracked pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.  However, the combination on a rice cake is horrible.  The onion powder tastes like the old onion powder I had to throw out last year.  I'm known for continuing to eat somethat that tastes bad to me.  However, I can't this bag and neither will my family.  They really went wrong with this one.  I'm not afraid to try the Quakes, but none of the other options appealed to me.

review/summary: Three Happy Cats
review/text: I can't believe I found one food that works for all three of my cats...<br /><br />Our youngest "baby" has suffered with painful bowel problems and we have decided that she's probably allergic to poultry.  Thankfully she's adjusted well to this Natural Balance Green Pea & Salmon food.  No more kitty suffering makes me a happy lady...  And has helped to properly potty-train a little one who no longer associates the litter box with pain.<br /><br />My older kitten with no health problems also loves the food and has maintained a healthy appetite and weight.<br /><br />Incredibly, though, this has turned out to be a perfect food for my 12 year old obese kitty also.  She's been on high quality "lite" food nearly her whole life, but she was continuing to gain weight on very small amounts of food and always "starving".  Her sister, adopted by a friend, had the same difficulties.  They were finally able to begin losing weight on a prescription diabetes food (although they don't have diabetes).  But my girl hit a plateau and continued to complain daily that she was *hungry*.  With the Green Pea & Salmon food, though, she doesn't complain unless we're late providing her meal (despite being fed a small amount) and is gradually losing weight.  Her arthritis seems to have disappeared and she's more playful and happy.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change is that I'd like to be able to buy a bigger bag...  Buying only 10 pounds at a time is not as cost effective as I'd like.  The food is quite expensive, but worth it for the health of my three girls.  I just wish I could get a little price break by buying in a bigger quantity.

review/summary: The perfect food for my cat
review/text: For many years, I fed my now 10 year old long haired male cat a mainstream brand of cat food that I believed was high quality.  Over the past couple of years my cat started having stomach problems and was throwing up excessively...to the point of needing to be rehydrated at the vet at least once a year.  I tried canned wet food but it made the problem even worse.  Every time my vet would simply recommend a sensitive stomach dry food but it never worked long term. We were caught in a terrible cycle and I felt awful for my poor cat!<br />After doing some research on my own, I determined that my cat may have a grain sensitivity.  I decided to try a limited ingredient diet and chose Natural Balance (salmon and pea).  After 3 months on Natural Balance, it is like I have a different cat!  Immediately, he enjoyed the food so no issue there.  His coat improved after 1 month and it is so shiny and smooth.  He has not gotten sick once except for the occasional hair ball, which is even less frequent now (1 every 2 weeks).  We have started supplementing with NB LID wet canned food and he loves it as well!<br />I cannot say enough about this wonderful food.  If you have a cat struggling with tummy problems, give this a try!  It solved our problems AND I feel great about feeding him this high quality, nutritious food.

review/summary: Saved my cats' lives
review/text: I truly believe I am not exaggerating when I say this food saved at least one of my cats' lives, if not others.  I have seven, so finding food that pleases all of them can be a challenge even though they really aren't picky eaters.  I had been feeding them Iams since my husband and I adopted our first two cats in 2000 until finding out Iams had been sold to another company.  We noticed a change in quality and one of my cats stopped eating and became very ill, which I remain convinced is partially the fault of the food.  After his death to cancer a year later, and much research on the benefits of a raw or at least wet food over dry food diet, I switched them to a mostly chicken canned wet diet until I could gather the supplies I'd need to make raw food.<br /><br />The kitty gods were not smiling on us, however, as one of my cats developed severe itching and scratched his chin and near his ears bloody.  He was allergic to chicken.  I immediately switched them all to the Duck and Green Pea formulation, which he (and most of them) loved and tolerated well.  Unfortunately our newest kitty, who is barely over a year old, is tiny.  And I do mean TINY.  She barely tops the scale at 3 lbs.  And she decided she did NOT like the duck.  Even worse, Jinx's allergic symptoms began to return.  He seems to be allergic to all poultry.  So we switched them again, to the Salmon and Green Pea flavor.  The difference is astounding!  Tinycat loves it and has gained a significant amount of weight (that she needed), the overweight kitties seem trimmer and their coats brighter and softer, and most importantly, Jinx is rapidly improving from his allergic symptoms.  I would still prefer to feed them a raw diet but with so many cats and many of them approaching middle-age or older, there are too many factors to manage, not least of all Jinx's problems.  Natural Balance has saved his life (and perhaps Tiny's as well!) not to mention my sanity.

review/summary: Allergy Cat loves NB!
review/text: I've got a cat with a SEVERE food allergy.  Her face just scabs right up and she gets staph and ringworm everywhere.  She'll scratch where it itches, and then her paws would abscess after that.  We spent record amounts of time at the vet and she was constantly taking antibiotics and getting steroid shots.  I was getting scratched ALL the time because she was grumpy (steroids) and I had to pill her one zillion times a day!  LOL.  I tried a lot of foods recommended by the vet, and the Science Diet and Royal Canin had awful ingredients at a premium price.  The Z/D did nothing for her symptoms even though it had "Tiny proteins that wouldn't exacerbate the problem".<br /><br />I was very pleased to try out NB for less than half the cost of these other options.  She loves it, the other cats don't mind munching on it either.  The ingredient list is one I can stand behind, too.<br /><br />Just in case you were wondering, it creates feces of a very mild and unassuming odor.  Even the wet food isn't bad at all.

After much research and trial and error, I found she could tolerate Natural Balance limited ingredients formulations.  She really seems to not tolerate any foods with grains, which is a significant filler for many brands of cat foods, even the "organic" and "natural" brands.  Her diarrhea and vomiting problems significantly improved after about 6-8 weeks on a strict diet of Natural Balance limited ingredient duck and pea dry food, mixed with organic pumpkin (no spices or salt), and some feline probiotics.  She managed to gain weight after that, and has been doing well since.

review/summary: Great for cats with allergies!
review/text: I bought this cat food for a cat that has a chicken allergy.  This brand cat food along with the green pea and duck are the only type cat food that he can keep down without vomiting.  I won't buy anything else for him, and it's great for any other cat with food allergies.

review/summary: My sensitive, finicky cat loves it!
review/text: I have 3 cats; 2 of them suffer from allergies, and the other 1 eats too quickly. After a lot of worry and vet bills, I decided to try this food out. Everyone absolutely loves it! The allergy-ridden cats benefit from its limited ingredients, the fast eater benefits from the smaller kibble size and its easy digestibility, and they seem to really enjoy the taste. High recommended. : )

review/summary: For sensetive tummies
review/text: We adopted the SWEETEST little orange tabby kitten from the Humane Society. He has the most awesome personality of any cat I have ever had....and so I was very persistent in trying to get to the bottom of what is wrong with his tummy! His daily bowel movements were so frequent(5-7 times a day), loose and had a strong "acidic" (horroble) odor. I even paid top dollar and switched his food to EVO innova grain free dry kitten food for a couple months and only saw a slight decrease in frequency of bm's, but still diarrhea-looking and stinky stinky. The vet mentioned that he may have a food allergy. He said "when a cat has a food allergy it is almost always the meat source." I don't know if this is true but I thought it would be worth a try to change food again. So since EVO's top meat sources were chicken and turkey, and the Humane Society had him on purina kitten chow (meat source chicken) I turned to this NB limited ingredients diet with salmon as the only meat source.<br />I slowly mixed a small amount with his old food and it didn't even take 12 hours to notice a BIG change. Now it's only been 3 days- he's not even fully switched over to NB L.I.D. exlusively and he only has had ONE bowel movement a day. And let me tell you people who may not be aware- one BM a day is how it is suppose to be! The litter box odor is way way down. I can only imagine that my little Cheetoh's tummy feels loads better too!<br />The price may seem high, but for any grain free kibble you are going to be paying more because there aren't fillers like rice and corn, etc in it. I am grateful for this dry cat food. I would recommend giving it a try to anyone who is considering spending a small fortune at the vet to figure out why your kitty has a "sensetive stomach."

review/text: I normally don't take the time to write reviews but I am so grateful for this cat food.  My poor three year old tuxedo cat Sophia would vomit every day.  After trying countless expensive high quality dry and wet food brands I tried NB Salmon and pea.  She hasn't thrown up since, is looking and feeling fantastic.  She's always been sweet, but a little shy.  But now she's much friendlier and outgoing and playful, the way a healthy cat should be.  THANK YOU Natural Balance!!!!  I highly recommend this product, will never use any other cat food.  PS. My other cat likes it too!

review/summary: My cats stomach jumped out her mouth and said hello
review/text: I picked up a sample of this stuff at a health fair and figured that I would just use it as treats and keep my cat on her Iams.  I came home and gave my cat her normal "welcome home" snack which she normally eats with a standard amount of cat excitement.  I actually thought that she would be disappointed-- it's just cat food, after all, akin to giving a 5-year-old a carrot when he's expecting an Oreo (right?)<br /><br />Not the case.  When I gave her a piece of this food she went bonkers.  She even jumped on the shelf and knocked over the container to try to get more out and continued with this behavior for an hour until I hid it in my sock drawer.  the next morning when I opened the sock drawer she ran right up and demanded more NOW.  I have never seen her love a food so much!  It's crazy, I feel like I am living in the middle of a cat food commercial for this stuff.<br /><br />I notice that most people seem to be buying this food for health reasons, but I am buying it because I am afraid that my cat is going to murder me in my sleep if I don't.

I believe they may have a problem with chicken or with grains. I haven't tried the NB chicken yet....too happy with the improvement to try anything different! Sigh of major relief!!

review/summary: Really good cat food for my two guys with very diferent problems!
review/text: I bought this because I have two cats; one of them recently-diagnosed diabetic and both eat the same food pretty unavoidably. My guy who isn't diabetic has a sensitive stomach, used to vomit a lot and tends to go disastrously off his feed (have almost lost him this way twice because he just shuts down and won't eat anything). On the Natural Balance Limited Ingredient, my diabetic cat is very well-controlled with a protein content his kidneys can handle and my sensitive-stomach guy maintains a good weight, seems to enjoy this food quite a lot and no longer vomits daily. IT WORKS! Both are hale and healthy with issues under control. They are 14 years old, but you'd never know it to look at them or watch them, despite their difficulties. I highly recommend this very high-quality, and apparently quite appealing cat food. I buy it on Amazon all the time because it's less expensive, and, with my Prime membership, it shows up at my door w. no shipping charge two or three days after I order it, so I do less running around in my car.

review/text: This is the only food we have ever feed our now year and a half old cat. Liliath is strong, happy, healthy with an awesomely shiny silky coat. Her potty never smells, she is never gassy and also she has only ever had 1 hair ball. I started feeding her Natural Balance LID when she was 8 weeks old because I had fed the doggy version to my lab who had allergies and he loved it and I wanted to feed our new kitten a high quality cat food that I knew she would never have issues with. Liliath is so picky she even turned her nose up at some Fancy Feast a friend tried to give her. I love that with this food it feeds them their entire lives...no need to ever switch from kitten formula to adult.

review/text: I had been a little nervous about this cat food as other reviewers mentioned stinky litterboxes. Its been quite the opposite for me. When I adopted my cat, the spca had him on friskies which reeked like hell on the exit. Also, he had pretty bad dandruff, which i know from past pets can be due to a food allergy. We very gradually switched over. He likes the food, and the litter box is far less stinky. He also likes the wet food of the same variety, and its very convenient to have Amazon ship it all. Best part: the dandruff went away, and he's far less itchy.

review/summary: Absolutely Amazing!! Fixed our kitty's mystery chronic diarrhea!
review/text: Our recently adopted cat had been having diarrhea for the entire two months we've had her. We kept taking her to the vet who would run fecal test after test to try to determine if she had parasites, a bacterial infection or something else. Every test was negative and every medication we tried had absolutely no effect. We also tried fiber and bland diets with no change. It was becoming a pretty severe situation as every day we dealt with stinky surprise accidents on our furniture and carpet. Finally our only option was to *maybe* see if she had a food allergy or do a $600 biopsy. This food absolutely saved us all! I'm assuming chicken or grain was what was giving her issue, but with only 24 hours of eating this food and her stool is 100% normal! She is peppy, happy, and no longer stinky! It's like night and day...amazing!!! If you are struggling with these issues give this food a try. I hope that it can work as amazingly for you as it did for us!!!

review/text: We brought home a young female cat from the local shelter. Poor little one had runny poop when we got her and couldn't even make it into the litter box in time. She also ate like she was starving all the time and when she went outside we couldn't stop her from eating every weed she could find. Luckily when researching "runny cat poop" I found the reviews on this cat food. I'm so very glad to report that after slowly switching her food to this over a period of 10 days, she is now having regular bowel movements. Oh my, what a relief! I never thought the highlight of this year would be finding solid cat poop when cleaning the litter!!! And our other cat loves this food too - a double blessing. Hope it works for your cat too if it has this problem.

I have been stressing what to feed them and how to find the 'kitten fountain of youth' Bella has dry skin issues, it didnt seem nearly as bad one this food so obviously, I wanted to like this food, i got a good price on it (sticker on the bag at petco was 5 dollars off, and it was sale) I got it home and opened it up, and man did it stink! I ended up giving them the whole bag (I'm not about to throw money away) but, since i bought a big bag, i can safely say the next two months where quite... strong. Used a lot of air freshener, even with twice daily scooping.<br /><br />Maybe with another kind of flavor, I plan to give it another go once the Purina runs out.

review/summary: What am I doing wrong?
review/text: I introduced this expensive dry cat food to my four little ones yesterday, and all night long they were jumping around on the bed waking me up (they only do this when their feeder is empty) because they were hungry and didn't want to TOUCH this food. Only one of them (who will eat practically ANYTHING) is okay with it. The rest nibble a bit, and then shove it around on the floor in front of their bowl. I read the reviews and thought this would be an instant hit - so what am I doing wrong? Should I mix it with some of their old kitty "junk" food (aka Purina One) or is it a lost cause? Please help, I want my babies to be healthy!<br /><br />PS. I will change my rating if they actually start eating it, but until then it's one star for the 1 out of 4 cats that are eating it. One of my cats would rather eat foam peanuts than this food (NOT good or healthy)...

review/summary: Great stuff - but one carton will last a lifetime!
review/text: When I was much younger, I actually popped popcorn for a living! For both United Artists theaters and General Cinema. This salt is, as far as I can recall, exactly what I used there, and in my own experiments this salt creates the correct color and taste in your movie theater style popcorn.<br /><br />But, and this is a big but, I only used 1/2 teaspoon for a typical "large bowl" batch of popcorn. Any more and the flavor became too salty IMO. For a camping trip recently, I popped about 10 pounds of popcorn for my campmates over the course of 4 days, and I still have at least 4/5 of the 35 oz carton left. Your mileage may vary, but I think one of these cartons would easily flavor about 30-40 pounds of popcorn.<br /><br />So, my advice is definitely get some of this salt, but get one carton and order more later if you really need it.<br /><br />I rated the product at 4 out of 5 stars because the quantity in a 35 oz carton is simply too much even for wild popcorn maniacs, and it is not obvious from their description of the product how much you should really buy.

review/summary: Does not dry overnight; thick gel hard to apply evenly
review/text: Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make "ladybug spots and antennae," which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug "heads") very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.

review/summary: Why make black icing at home?
review/text: I hate making black icing at home, there's always an after taste from the food coloring and it ends up being a big mess. The Wilton tubes of black icing are great for frozen buttercream transfers when I decorate a birthday cake and much easier to handle.

review/summary: Awesome Quality
review/text: True Himalayan Pink Salt.  I won't bore you with all the wonderful benefits of this mineral-rich salt.  I'll figure you won't be here if you aren't already aware of them.<br /><br />This is excellent, rich, pink salt.  It is ground very well, and is suitable for use as both kitchen and table salt. It has a nice flavor and works perfectly in all our recipes. If you plan to store it in a shaker, you want to add some uncooked rice in with it, or it will lump badly.  It is very fine, so it absorbs all the moisture, without rice to help it.<br /><br />We love the quality of this brand, and will buy more, and more. :)

review/text: I bought this salt after reading Suzanne Somer's books. It turned out to be great because this salt does contain more minerals than "NA/CL", meaning you get a supply of important nutrients and does not have to ingest anti-caking ingredients in regular salt. But I do not know if Himalayan does supply iodine. The food tastes great, you can feel the difference. Great product!!

review/summary: Best Tasting Salt AND So Incredibly Good For You
review/text: This is the best tasting salt I've ever had.  I learned about this after starting a "raw" diet and I was obsessed about having everything raw.  I'm a condiment queen and it was really hard for me to give up a lot of my condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo).  I was never a salt user - I'm a self-described fresh pepper addict and connoisseur.  However, once I realized this salt was raw, all natural and got great reviews, I decided to try it.  This really does enhance almost every dish I eat.  In addition, there are a ton of articles online explaining why this 200 million year old natural nutrient is so very good for us.  Move over table salt with your history of ridicule and side effects; move in Himalayan salt.

review/text: I do a lot of Cajun cooking. I have been making my own seasoning combinations for a while.. I try to keep MSG and sugar out of my diet. I decided to give this a try. I made a pot of chilly. The only change I made this time was this salt. It was AMAZING!! My only regret now is that I only ordered a pound. Next time it will be more.<br /><br />This salt is also a great for exfoliation in the bath!<br /><br />One note: do be sure to add several grains of uncooked rice to the package as soon as you open it. It does start to clump rather quickly.

review/summary: Product not as described
review/text: Package arrived in time.  I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.  The salt was more like rock salt - the crystals being slightly larger than what you find in kosher salt.  I have to dilute it with water before I can consume it.  If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food.  This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid. The package it is in is also labeled "finely ground".<br /><br />I use it for cooking - where I have no problems with it.  The three stars are only because the salt was not what I would consider finely ground.

review/summary: Delicious Nutritious Non-nuclear Salt at a Great Price
review/text: I love salt and use a variety of salts to keep my blood pressure up in the normal range.<br /><br />This salt, I think, may be the same as that sold by David Wolfe's LongevityWarehouse but you get twice as much for roughly the same price.  Not only are the descriptions similar, but comparing the salts side-by-side, they have the exact same color, flavor, texture, grind, fragrance, etc in my opinion.<br /><br />Himalayan salt is definitely much cleaner than sea salt ever since the Fukushima plant began leaking radiation into the Pacific Ocean last year if not before.  Many people are unaware of this because the major television stations are not broadcasting information that would incriminate their owners but just google or YouTube search if you want to know what is happening and what your government is not doing about it.  I definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like ENENews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth.  If the sea salt wasn't harvested before Fukushima started dumping nuclear waste, it is just too risky to ingest.<br /><br />This salt is from the Himalayas which may be just as far from Fukushima's dumping ground as you can get!

review/summary: SALTY  SALT I HAVE EVER TASTED
review/text: This salt is pink in colour and upon recieveing it I used a tooth pick and dampened the end of the tooth pick and stuck the tip, JUST THE TIP, of the tooth pick into the pink looking salt and tasted it, and WOW! The salt taste about knocked me off my feet! The 2 pounds of this salt will last a very long time! I can use a lot less to salt whatever I want to have a salted flavour. It takes very little sprinkled on food or when cooking to obtain the desired salt flavour. It is great salt and it will last much longer than normal every day salt from the grocery store down town that I usualy buy for 78 cents to a dollar something. I recomend all people give this salt a try. As far as Iodine as a nessary nutriant, just eat potatoes ever so often and you will get the nessary iodine that you need in your diet, so no worries there. I can not wait to try this Himalayan Salt on Popcorn. I have been very un-satisfied with the normal every day salt from the store for a long time. Even sea salt has no "punch" to it like this salt. This is salt as it was meant to be and taste. (my opinion)

review/summary: good salt, good price, but not fine!
review/text: I got this to hold us over because our usual supplier was sold out right when we needed more Himalayan salt. The quality is good, but the salt is most certainly NOT finely ground. The crystals are the same size as previous Himalayan salt that we purchased in the past, which is coarser than regular table salt. When described as finely ground, I was expecting smaller sized crystals. Our usual supplier is in stock again, so I probably won't be purchasing this brand again if not necessary. But the price is pretty good and the quality seems fine, so I would recommend this to people who are looking to try Himalayan salt.

review/summary: Very pretty, but would not buy again
review/text: I bought this as an alternative to the sea salts that I normally purchase.  I find that the salt does not dissolve fully - it leaves a gritty residue behind, whether in sauces, soups, pickles or pasta water.  The flavor is fine, and when cooked in dishes the grit doesn't seem to be an issue, but I like my salts to be versatile, and this one doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I've got a Himalayan pink salt cooking plate, and I'm quite satisfied with that, but I don't use any liquid when cooking with it.

Real salt is the laziest company I know for not using an evaporation/filtering process to remove the dirt and sand!<br /><br />I am now the happy new owner of 4 lbs of Himalayan salt and it's not only clean unlike real salt, it tastes 10 levels better too! The company also has something like 200 different salts for your salt tasting pleasure! I will be ordering much more and sending as a gift to all my friends and family!

review/summary: Sensational and smooth
review/text: I had been looking for this for a while and hadn't been able locate it locally. I prefer it over sea salt or kosher. It is amazingly smooth with slight but perceptible mineral notes in the flavor. Kosher type salts seem to have a sharper edge to the taste. I highly recommend it for steaks or grilled salmon. It also gives a unique flavor and appearance to margaritas. Wonderful product.

review/summary: Great Quality
review/text: The salt is great quality and taste - if you haven't already stooped using table salt (Sodium Chloride) I urge you to read about the benefits of using Himalayan salt - not only does it taste better - it is much better for your health.

review/summary: Good salt
review/text: I've never tried any other himalayan salt but I really like it! I don't think it is as strong as normal white table salt, but it is tastier. Will continue to buy here!

I joined the GoGaStudios in Texarkana....and the exercise place believes in the Himalayan salt...so am trying this salt for my edema...which is actually lymphedma.

review/summary: Very Potent
review/text: This has a much saltier taste than table salt or even sea salt. I think I like sea salt better than this stuff, but that is quite probably just personal preference. I find that sea salt has more of a mouth watering quality, whereas this salt is more of a sharp saltiness.<br /><br />It would be excellent for desserts - like salt water taffy or a salty caramel.

review/text: Terrific salt.  Very pretty too.  If all you have ever tasted is salt from the grocery store then you need to try this.  You won't buy generic salt again.
