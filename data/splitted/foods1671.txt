review/summary: Very Pleased
review/text: It's not as light and fluffy as home made from scratch with real whipped cream, but it is quick and delicious nonetheless.<br />I'm not big on caffeine, so I used decaf when using this mix.<br />I think it's a very handy product to have in the cupboards and it is so quick to put together and then refrigerate for a couple of hours.<br />I'll definitely be making this more in the summer time for a light, cooling and refreshing dessert.

review/summary: Good basket, If Buying As Gift Check First
review/text: I purchased this for myself and the contained coffees were quite good.  The extras were a bit mediocre, half due to weak packaging.  The sugar packets were included in a mislabeled box, as were the creamers.  For your average coffee drinker the extras will be a pleasant surprise, just make sure you break open the basket and check the contents if you are giving this as a gift.

review/summary: Attractive for an office gift, but overpriced
review/text: This makes a good office gift -- it's functional and discreetly packaged without all Christmas frou frou decoration. The basket is well-made and would be a useful general-purpose addition to the desk or shelf. The coffee is very good.<br /><br />The problem is the price -- it seems to me to be too high by at least $10. There's relatively little contents in terms of amount and value. the mug is attractive but the other items are utilitarian -- powder creamer, wooden coffee stirrers and some nibbles. They do the job -- a complete coffee service -- but there is nothing distinctive.<br /><br />All in all, it's a well made gift and the basket is worth keeping.

review/summary: I'm pretty sure this was created as a joke
review/text: As my moniker suggests, I LOVE the glorious coffee bean. This, however, has got to be some sort of test....trial by fire-brewed perhaps? At first sight this basket looked delightful. A relatively cheap basket, as is to be expected, filled with goodies. Then comes the unwrapping. The cello wrap was broken, perhaps that is evidence that some sneak removed the 'Jamaican Blend' that is promised but missing.<br />The 'Coffee Box' box was a plain box with a photo copied paper taped to it, which contained 3 Arbuckle single pot bags. The next stuff I am giving a star because of the hearty laugh it gave me...<br />Cafe Vergnano 1882 cookies (4) are ginger-y and a nice complement to the unimpressive but not-too-bad Arbuckle's coffee. The box of 'creamer' contained a few packets of the most generic of office coffee whitener, the brands car repair shops use while you wait to get the oil changed. The 'Sugar in the Raw' was few packets as well. Here is the delightful part. Each box was covered by taped on labels....over empty JELLO BOXES! But wait, it gets better. The coffee stirrers were in an empty Reese's Pieces box! I have this odd visual of rag-clad children being forced to empty Jello and candy boxes day in and day out.<br />If I were the Queen of Back Mountain Baskets...I'd have a ban on scotch tape. I would make sure that the wooden coffee stirrers aren't flavored by the still fragrant Reese's Pieces box. Better creamer or no creamer. I don't mind the diner-esque coffee mug, but perhaps a more trend-on shape would be nice.<br />The individually wrapped cookies/biscuits were quite nice. Perhaps I would add the tiny wrapped bits of chocolate served with coffee in most European cafes.<br /><br />Until all that happens, I think I'd rather have a basket that has the Jello and Reese's intact and original.<br /><br />EDIT PLEASE NOTE: I have been made aware that I received a MOCK UP and NOT the basket intended for Amazon customers.

review/summary: Luxury Gift Basket For Coffee Lovers
review/text: As I opened the package, the coffee aroma was very pleasant. The items were attractively presented. There is a box with a variety of coffee samples and other items listed here under product features, so I won't list them again.<br /><br />It's a gift basket for coffee lovers.<br /><br />The package reminds me of the welcome basket one might find in a luxury hotel. It's fine for what it is. It's definitely a luxury item. It doesn't contain anything necessarily practical, but that isn't usually the goal in mind for the buyer of a gift basket.

review/text: This comes with two flavored coffees and two regular coffees, an assortment of DELICIOUS, light cookies, coffee stirrers, raw sugar, mug, and mints.  The Arbuckle coffee was tasty; we weren't wild about the canister of Irish Cream. There are several packets of generic creamers, the reason for a knock-down to 4 stars.  Leave them out or have something fancier.  Gift basket is light weight, but certainly adequate.

review/summary: Perfect gift for a single coffee lover
review/text: I bought this for a European friend who likes to take the traditional "coffee and cake" break in the late afternoon. The contents included:<br />1 coffee mug<br />10 creamer packs<br />6 raw sugar packs<br />1 Kauai Blend coffee pack<br />1 Breakfast blend coffee pack<br />1 Columbian blend coffee pack<br />1 small canister of Irish Creme-flavored coffee<br />Jila mints<br />A pack of coffee stirrers<br />5 Galette biscuits (thin cookies that are waffled)<br />4 Biscotte (biscoffee)<br />1 double-pack of biscoff (biscotte)<br /><br />It really was a nice selection for a single person--I say this because of the pack having 1 mug, although there was certainly enough for two to enjoy coffee for about 3 days. As such, it does make an excellent gift for people who don't know what to get a single friend or coworker who enjoys the European tradition of coffee in the afternoon.<br /><br />I don't know if this is true for all baskets, but I was intrigued that they repurposed boxes with new labels, such as Jello boxes, to contain the goodies. I liked this, since I like to recycle things, myself and I found it interesting.<br /><br />THe goodies are not "premium" but they were good and I liked the addition of the raw sugar instead of the refined white. It is a good, solid selection.<br /><br />The basket was nice and had leather loops for hands. I've repurposed that to hold the bits and pieces that collect around my desk at work. And that's something else I wanted to mention, this is PERFECT for work. Everything is packaged in a way that makes it very, very convenient for work or travel. In fact, if you have a friend who travels a lot, this may be a great gift bcause of the individual packaging. It would be very easy to pack and the individual biscotte would be great for flying since you rarely get anything to eat on planes anymore.<br /><br />So, I'd recommend this as a gift for any single friend or coworker. I'm sure he or she will enjoy it!

review/summary: Cheap Coffee and nowhere near gift quality
review/text: I chose this basket because I'm a major coffee lover and a gift basket filled with a variety of international coffees, cookies, etc. sounded perfect for me. Unfortunately, I was more than a little disappointed by overall presentation and quality of the items included. The basket itself is nice and even reusable, but the straw filler material makes a mess when you take items out of the basket. It looked like a box of shredded wheat exploded on my table. The coffees were just okay: an Arbuckle Mocha Java, an Arbuckle Breakfast Blend, an Arbuckle Amaretto Royale and a small can of Irish Cream Coffee. (There wasn't any Jamaican Blend included in the basket I received.) The European style cookies were fine, as were the stirrers, sugar and mints. The creamer was generic. The iGourmet ceramic mug is a nice touch, but I still think this basket is way overpriced considering the quality. While a basket for coffee lovers is a great idea for an individual or as a gift, without an exceptional selection of gourmet coffees and lots of high quality extras, I'd rather pick up a bag of some high quality coffee and a pack of cookies at the grocery store for a fraction of the price.

review/summary: Best tonic water ever!
review/text: I found this tonic water in a store 60 miles from my home.  I avoid high fructose corn syrup which is found in almost every tonic water unless you buy diet which tastes horrible.  Whole foods has a couple with sugar which I buy when I'm there but that is 90 miles from my home so I don't go often.  This tonic is even better because it's sweetened with agave nectar and has fewer calories than the ones with sugar.  I ordered it because I don't travel to the store where I found it often.

review/text: I picked a 4-pack of Q Tonic up at the grocery store, not knowing it was supposed to be an "artisanal" product. Frankly, I just don't think it tastes very good; I think the main issue being that the taste of agave clashes with both the quinine and with the gin (and I tried it with two different kind of gins, Bulldog and Hendricks). It was also quite flat, which didn't help, though that could have just been a problem with the pack I bought. At any rate, it just doesn't make as good a gin and tonic as your standard variety tonic, despite costing a good deal more.

review/text: I'm absolutely in love with my Tanqueray & Tonics; I drink them at least once a week and was looking for a way to improve what seemed insurmountable with a better tonic water. Usually, I stick with Seagrams (and have even gone with Diet a few times). I purchased this case of Q Tonic thinking it would mix the low-calorie of diet tonic with the rich taste of non-diet tonic. I was wrong! After having numerous picky drinkers give Q tonic a taste, we've all come to the same conclusion: it tastes eerily similar to seltzer water. Have you ever been to a bar and ordered something with tonic only to find that they were out and substituted seltzer instead--it's no fun! Well, picture spending $45 dollars on a case of fancily bottled seltzer and mixing that with your favorite drink!<br /><br />So, in conclusion: if you like the fancy bottles and the lower calorie seltzer water tasting tonic, this is the tonic you want. If you enjoy the distinction of actual tonic versus seltzer, stay away from Q Tonic.

The supplier does not ship them here I cannot imagine why,since we use the same USPS as in the 48 contiguous.  I had to order them to my daughter's home and she then forwarded them to me. But they are soo delicious, that I'd rather do that than go without them.  These are smooth, not crunchy, but "sweetish" and fulfilling to the palate.  They enhance any meal I add them to, particularly stir fry veggies with meat, any kind of meat.  They will take the flavor of whatever I'm cooking and calories are none existent.  I recommend them to all buyers.

review/summary: delicious specialty dish mushrooms
review/text: I have found consistently high quality in almost every Roland product I've ordered over the years, with very few exceptions.<br /><br />I ordered these straw mushrooms to make Thai Tom Yum soup but use them in miscellaneous stir fry dishes also.  My husband who tends to complain about some kinds of mushrooms really likes these. Some mushrooms (portabellini for example) can get dried out and rubbery if they are overcooked even a little.  These canned straw mushrooms stay soft - not mushy. And they taste good, too!<br /><br />The only thing that could make these mushrooms better (and other Roland products as well) is if Roland changes to BPA-free can linings.  That would be wonderful!<br /><br />Unfortunately all the cans in my first delivery were totally bashed/smashed (way beyond dented!). As always, the customer service rep was most gracious and the replacement shipment arrived in perfect condition in its own sturdy cardboard  shipping box.<br /><br />I actually placed this order as a separate order but the shipping department combined this order with 5 others, some of which were my monthly subscribe and save items, and threw them all into one big box.  Most of you "out there" know that Amazon has a problem in its shipping department with people who have not been trained to not throw a heavy cardboard case of canned goods on top of bubble wrapped cans.  Bubble wrap can only do so much!<br /><br />I am becoming more and more hesitant about ordering any canned products from Amazon and that is a shame because I've done a high percentage of my shopping on Amazon for several years and would like to continue to do so.

review/summary: Smoke your own "UPDATE"
review/text: OK to good flavor. Better deal than the rest they sell on Amazon mostly because you get a full 16+ ounces.  Flavor? I'm spoiled because I used to catch and smoke my own but still good. The more I eat the better I like it.<br /><br />I might not find a better value, all considered I'll buy more of this unless I can find better product/value.<br /><br />UPDATE! UPDATE:<br />I ordered this brand again, this time I looked for the expiration date.  I looked very carefully both on the box and on the sealed gold package.  As I have ordered almost every brand Amazon sells and they ALL have a expiration date ranging from 2013 - 2016 but NO DATE on this one.  I was going to sign up for a subscription,  NO WAY now.<br />It doesn't taste like it's 10 years old but who knows?

review/text: These were a gift to someone else, who loved them dearly. You get a "case" & about 10 sticks to a "pack". I thought there could have been more flavor or candy taste to them, but my friend said they are perfect,<br />I agree with the other poster about the double the price for shipping YIKES!!<br /><br />Con: I was surprised that on my check out, nothing was said about tax, nor how much the shipping was going to be. Amazon mentioned (many times) that my items will have to ship to them, than they would ship to me. Which should have been nice, as I wanted the order to arrive together. So I was thinking that most of the order was going to be ground shipping, & part of the order was free shipping. What a surprise when the shipping was twice the price of the product's cost, plus tax!!!

review/summary: Huge Disappointment
review/text: If your desire is to relive childhood memories through your taste buds, this underwhelming substitute will make you feel like crying.<br /><br />Candy cigarettes I bought in the mid to late 1960s had a wonderfully subtle (still can't name it) flavor that was so enjoyable I'd suck on one end of a candy cigarette to try to make it last as long as I could, and would innevitably be unable to resist biting into it. The old/original candy cigarettes crunched when you bit into one, and only with biting it did you discover the mild grit and the slightly chalky taste.<br /><br />The only similarities between the candy cigarettes of the 1960s and the product being sold here is the shape of the candy, and maybe the packaging. There's no flavor in this product (and I really do mean no flavor) and the texture is all wrong. Biting into one = no crunch, no grit, no chalky flavor. It just melts into a glob in your molars that feels (but doesn't taste like) confectioners sugar.

review/text: I recently ordered another box of these candy cigarettes.  I like to keep them in stock for my grandchildren.  This time they were not the same...  The last box listed, 'gelatin', in the ingredients and this new box lists, 'beef gelatin'.  They are not as good as the previous boxes and the grandchildren haven't even asked for them again since they tried a box of the new ones.  The ingredients have also been listed in a different order compared to the previous box.  Not sure I will ever order them again!  Unless of course, they go back to the other recipe and then I know I will order them again.  I have been eating these ever since I was a child...  It will be a shame if they don't go back to the old recipe...

The candy box was not sealed and it was all dusty on the outside, and when you opened it the ciggarete individual boxes were all dusty. I opened one of the individual cases and there were like 5 or 6. I opened another box and there was 5. I tried one of the candy sticks and it tasted horrible! not a good buy at all.

review/text: I remembered these from the 70's.  We used to buy these for snacks and they were good.  This is a product that has been able to stand the test of time.  I ordered these last year and was a little worried that I would remember them better then they are.  Nope just as good.  They are for people who can't have nuts but want a nut flavor in a snack.  Crunchy, salty and nutty describes these.  I ordered for a friend at work and we split.  She shared her's with others but I kept mine and snacked when I was temped to reach for the chips.  They are easy to carry in a baggie in your purse so you can have them around when the urge strikes.  If you remember these from years ago they haven't changed, just as good.  You won't be dissappointed.

review/text: My wife Carlene and I have known about Wheat Nuts for many years, but we have not seen it on our grocer's shelves for a long time.  We cook for a church function, and Carlene wanted to make a cold salad that had chicken, fruit, mixed greens, and nuts.  We know that at least one person who would be attending has a nut allergy, and we had decided to leave out the nuts.<br /><br />Carlene thought of Wheat Nuts - a nut free food that tastes a lot like pecans.  But where to buy it?  When three special shopping trips failed to find any, well, what else was there to do but turn to Google.  Sure enough, there they were on Amazon.  The jar pictured looked like we remembered, and the price was certainly reasonable, so I placed an order for 6 jars.<br /><br />I am pleased to report that the shipment arrived in good time, and was well packed.  Best of all, the product was exactly what we remembered.  The taste went well with the rest of the ingredients.  I would recommend Wheat Nuts as a substitute for nuts in a recipe - and they are great eaten out of hand.

review/summary: Pet Green Treat are amazingly good!!!
review/text: Ask my boy how good they are.....he is absolutely crazy about them..they are gluten free and made of great ingredients. A lot of the pet stores in South Florida don't carry their brand but you can order through Amazon or the manufacturer. Your dog is going to love all their products, you will see, try them

review/summary: Love the Lay's Limon
review/text: I tried the Lay's Limons while working in Colorado & I was hooked!!! I too contacted Lay's (via e-mail) to see if they could begin selling the item in my region (the South) or if I could purchase them from them(Lay's) . Unfortunately, it wasn't possible for Lay's to do such a thing so...curiosity advised that I check Amazon and I did!!! I'm glad that I did. I ordered on the 31st of July, I received them by the 6th of August (from Cheapees). My chips were boxed perfectly! I was worried that they'd be crushed & crumbled, but they weren't!!! So...kudos to Cheapees!!!

review/summary: Great Chip, Lousy Shipping
review/text: I agree with the previous reviewer; these are the best chips on the planet, but there's got to be a better way of shipping them then stacking them in a bare cardboard box!  I guess I should be happy to get them at all -- I couldn't believe these fabulous treats weren't available in stores east of Texas.  I will keep ordering them (can we put them on Subscribe & Save?), but I'll also keep hoping they find a better way to ship them to me so I have fewer crumbs and more chips!

review/text: These are sooooooo good. Seriously yummy. Even my 13yr old daughter loves these and she hates nuts....or she did until she snagged a few of these lol. They are the perfect mix of chocolate/caramel/nuts. I love that the nuts are whole and not pieces like some brands that do "turtles" candies. The only draw back was the price but since I can't find these at our local Costco I deal with it.

review/text: I could have actually enjoyed this product if it didn't have this gross musty smell and all of the pieces weren't stuck together in one melted lump. I guess the last part was the fault of humid weather, though. But I seriously couldn't get past the smell. Plus, I heard it was overpriced, so don't really like the idea of that.

review/summary: Doesn't look very appetizing
review/text: I bought these because my brother LOVES them and they stopped selling them at our Costco.  So, since they were a gift, it was important that at least look okay... they looked terrible!  I understand that they were shipped, but the chocolate was cracked in places and chunks of it had stuck to the container.  Ah, well... I'm sure he'll still be excited because he likes them so much, but still pretty disappointing since I paid over twice what they used to cost at Costco.

review/summary: Refreshing, yummy, great pick-me-up
review/text: I vowed to give up coffee for water, but it wasn't working.  Then someone educated me on the virtues of teas -- and I have a cabinet full of about 20 different varieties to prove it!  Octavia's Rainforest Mint Yerba Mate was my first foray in to loose tea, which I brew exactly as the tin instructs (boil water, but cool slightly to pour over tea infuser, cover, steep 3-4 minutes).  I LOVE IT!  With summer here, I use 2 infusers  with 8-9 ounces of hot water, then add ice for a mid-day pick me up.  Its perfect as is, just the right hint of mint and something else that keeps me from needing sweetener or having a bitter aftertaste.  Now if only I could figure out how to make it 2 quarts at a time to serve to family and guests...<br /><br />I don't know about the metabolism/weight loss aid it touts.  It would be a great side perk, but for now I'm just happy to have a pleasant way to increase my "water" intake!

review/text: I have tried different sugar substitutes.  This one is terrible.  If anyone had given me a clue as to how bad this is I would not have purchased it.  I can only use Xylitol or Stevia as a sweetner.  Now that I have tried both I can only say DO NOT BUY this product if you want to sweeten anything.  It just does not work.  I  cannot give this away.  No one wants it.  Sorry but a review should be honest.

review/summary: Terrible taste, terrible packaging
review/text: I ended up buying this at a local store instead of here, but the product is the same.<br /><br />1) It barely sweetens. I put 8 in my cup of coffee before I surrendered and returned to brown sugar.<br /><br />2) The packages are terrible. Almost impossible to open. There's a little "tear here" notch which is utterly useless, as it's hard to start opening, then causes the package to very suddenly give, causing crystallized bits to fly everywhere upon opening. (Yes, it takes that much force to open the package. I eventually gave up doing it manually and hunted down a pair of scissors.)<br /><br />Horrible product all around. Don't waste your money.

review/text: I didn't have the problems the other reviewers did with this product.  It's convenient to have little packages of xylitol with you.  The tearing notch doesn't work well, but it's not impossible to open.  If you're used to artificial sweeteners, you may need to use two or more packets of this stuff to get the sweetness you want.  I don't normally buy xylitol in individual packets like this, but I use it everyday at home.  It tastes as close to real sugar as *anything* else I've tried.

With this product I get my money's worth and it's good idea to boot.<br /><br />Only one quibble: the tea is not large chunks of spearmint but small flakes. So if you're using a teaball, the sediment goes through. If that's important to you, you'll need another way of brewing this particular tea.

review/summary: Good Spearmint Tea (but inconsistent)
review/text: This spearmint tea is very nice. Like all Davidson's teas it's Organic, so you aren't drinking down loads of nerve agents.<br /><br />It would be very inexpensive even if not organic, great value.<br /><br />Oh, and so far none of these have turned out to be peppermint, they have been without a doubt spearmint (I like peppermint as well). Excellent tea.<br /><br />UPDATE-<br /><br />The problem with this tea (and with the peppermint from Davidson's) is it's inconsistent. Sometimes you get a great bag of it, other times it has no flavor. Since writing the above review I've recieved bad batches of both mints, hardly any taste or smell. So when it's good, it's an easy 5 stars, but when it isn't, it's worthless. Hopefully that will explain the mixed reviews. I've had nothing but great tea from Davidson's otherwise (red, honey bush, chamomile, etc).

review/summary: Just like Grandma used to make!
review/text: I bought this product with trepidation because in the past I'd tried other fig preserves that were extremely disappointing - too much sugar, or bad figs, or somebody held their pinky the wrong way. Just bad.<br /><br />I held my breath when I opened up the Harvest Song Gourmet jar and took a spoonful out to taste. Then the heavens opened! Choirs of Angels sang! Tiny bluebirds rested on my shoulders! Okay, not really, but this stuff was the real thing - it tastes *exactly* like Grandma's homemade. Exactly. That she made in her kitchen in New Orleans 40 years ago with figs that Grandpa grew in the backyard.<br /><br />So if you are a fig lover, I highly recommend these preserves - they are to die for. If you've never tried figs or especially fig preserves, you don't know what you're missing!
