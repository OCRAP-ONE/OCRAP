review/summary: What's in it?
review/text: I complained to Amazon about the original package I received, since I thought it tasted moldy.  They helpfully sent me a second bag, and only then did I notice that the front panel says "tea and herbs" - and it clearly contains something to which I am apparently allergic (and is neither a tea nor an herb, BTW), and the replacement tasted awful, too.  I believe I've encountered the ingredient before, mixed into some red bush tea, which fortunately DID list ingredients.  I put that stuff in the compost, and will do the same with this, since it's supposedly organic.  I don't want to bother Amazon about this again, as it isn't their fault and they were most helpful in replacing the original shipment; but I would caution anyone who likes mate tea to avoid this one.  I will be looking for "100% mate" on the labels from now on.

review/summary: EXCELLENT STUFF!!
review/text: I MAKE A LOT OF FRUIT CAKES FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. LAST YEAR I MADE 13 CAKES AT A COST OF ABOUT $30.00 PER CAKE. BECAUSE I FOUND THIS 30 LB TUB OF CANDIED FRUIT FOR $68.00 MADE BY THE SAME COMPANY, MY COST PER CAKE HAS DROPPED DRAMATICALLY. I WAS PAYING $6.0O PER POUND FOR THE CANDIED FRUIT AND IT TAKES 2LBS OF THE FRUIT PER CAKE. SO INSTEAD OF $12.00 PER CAKE I NOW PAY JUST $2.26 PER POUND OF FRUIT SO I AM SAVING ABOUT $7.50 PER CAKE.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN GOOD CONDITION.

review/summary: Glacier water and high alkalinity - I can feel the difference
review/text: Yes, there is sometimes a slight taste to the water, but it is not bad. Most other high alkaline waters I've found are purified, and I appreciate that this water is sourced from glacier water in British Columbia. I have a very sensitive alkaline/acid balance, and I can feel the effects of the water as I drink it. I find it calming to my nervous system while it strengthens my heat tolerance on hot Northern California days.

review/summary: An excellent peppermint!
review/text: I love C Howard Violet Mints.  I also love their Peppermints.  The texture is much like a Smartie or an Altoid, but a wee bit softer - not as hard and slick as a LifeSaver.  The mints are square and flattish.  The peppermint is fragrant and rich, but not 'curiously strong' at all.  I like Altoids, and LifeSavers, but C Howard's are, in my opinion, the very best peppermints ever made, and less than a $1 each for (about) 11 mints - a 'normal' candy size - is very good indeed.  It's fun to nibble the outside thicker edge off and eat the middle last (like a smartie, if you do that and know what I mean, though these are about 3/4 inch squared).

review/text: I liked the product enough, it made a nice textured pasta and was easy to work with (much easier than white flour).  I did think it almost had a sort of "fishy" taste on my first batch, but not so much with my second batch.  I honestly don't know whether or not this is normal with Semolina, I had never used it before.<br /><br />As for the price, I'm assuming that price is for 4 24oz packages (not each package at 11 something), which comes out to something less than 3 dollars per, which is better than my local grocery by almost 2 dollars per, so it's a nice savings.

review/summary: The most amazing Octopi-imitative confection you will ever buy!
review/text: Hello there.<br /><br />You may not know me, and I may not know you - I'm here for one reason, and that's to espouse why these Gummi Octopi are absolutely the best thing since lavender tea. How, may you ask, can simple gummi candy differentiate itself from one another? After all - all gummi candies taste relatively the same, like processed sugar, corn syrup, and chemical colouring. But that is precisely where the discerning synaesthete draws their inspiration! For whilst normal gummi-flavored candy products have a boring range of flavors (chemical red, chemical yellow, and chemical green), the Gummi Octopi not only dual-wield vibrant and bright colors yet unknown to most other brands of candy, their taste is simply divine! Ah! Ice-tentacle blue, and beryl yellow! The sweet satisfaction you provide!<br /><br />In addition to that and the product's proper status as Gummi Octopi, as noted by my fellow reviewer f. ferreiro, my other fellow reviewer - Brook Lindquist - raises and equivalid point. The cuteness of the product can not be understated! Each individual octopus has two little eye-bumps and a smile carved into their trusting frame, and though destined to be eaten, seem to happily accept their fate. The packaging is both cute and functional; the dual-layered bags meaning that your candy will remain fresh for a significant time after you order it, should you not be ordering it as a gift for other - an extremely kind courtesy on behalf of the seller.<br /><br />Not only are they bright and cute, however! Did I mention that eating a handful of Gummi Octopi a day will increase your magical power? Well, it's true! I ordered these Octopi, and successfully found a job after searching for a significant amount of time, succeeded in all of my life goals save one, and found myself contacted by strange intelligences from beyond the stars!... So, what are you waiting for? Get you some o' these, today!..<br /><br />[In truth, I used to love these as a kid, and figured they weren't sold anywhere else in the world; it really made my day to find them again. And they are very cute and tasty, plus they ship and keep real well. If you want some gummi candy, it'd be hard to do better then these little fellas.]<br /><br />{And they really do increase your magical power.}

This product gets a 5/5 for great taste, great price, and overall awesome transaction through Amazon. I really enjoyed this product and have a case being sent to my uncle in Colorado. Give it a try if you're a fan of any of the brands I listed above. This is all natural and is sourced from Thailand where the drink is manufactured. To sum it all up, this is worth your money.

review/text: I've recently just about completely cut soda, energy drinks and sugary drinks in general from my diet, also anything with hydrogenized ingredients or high fructose corn syrup.  So, in an attempt to find healthy alternatives, I tried coconut water and was instantly hooked.  I've tried a bunch of brands; C2O, VitaCoco, Zico, Naked, ONE, Amy and Brian. Some taste better than others.  Some taste like toilet water.  This stuff is my new favorite.  So good.  I went through this whole pack in a couple of days.  If you haven't yet, you should give this brand a try.  My 9 year old cousin drank one in less than a minute, she loved it.

review/summary: Just what I was looking for!
review/text: After tryng almost every brand of coconut water that is available in the U.S., I have realized that they vary quite a bit in flavor by where the coconuts are grown. It is kind of like coffee. There is no "one brand" that meets everybody's preferences. Some are naturally sweeter than others. This is one of the coconut waters that rate high on the natural sweetness scale. For me, it is exactly what I wanted and could not be more pleased with the quality and taste of this coconut water. If you are looking for pure coconut water that is on naturally sweet side, then this is your stuff! It is not a bitter one and is very refreshing served ice cold. I liked it so much I am on the auto shipping of this product. Thanks for offering it Amazon!

review/summary: THIS IS THE BEST ONE EVER!!!!
review/text: I have been drinking cocnut water for the last year and love it however I keep changing brands once i find one thats better. I drank vitacoco and zico for a long time but never really liked the tangy aftertaste that i think comes from the vitamin c they add to the drink.  This coconut water is truly THE BEST one by far and I have already started a subscribe and save acct for it!! Its natural and good and pure cocnut water taste- no tangy-ness at all. They also have it with pulp if u like that which is equally good. EXCELLENT product-thank you Amazon!!!!

review/summary: Best Brand of Coconut Water
review/text: If you like coconut water, you'll love it! I've tried several types of coconut water, and this one is the best by far.<br /><br />I love this brand because I can actually taste the natural coconut, without any artificial flavors or added sweeteners. It's packed with nutrients, such as potassium, which make it perfect for recovering after work outs. Most of the time, I drink it chilled with dinner. Also,the aluminum can does a pretty good job of preserving the freshness without adding any additional "flavors" such as in the case of plastic bottles.<br /><br />Ordering from Amazon Subscription service is a bonus because it is sometimes difficult to locate this drink in the supermarket (plus it hardly is ever on sale). I wish it came in a pack of 16 instead of 12.

review/summary: Best coconut water on the market by far!
review/text: I've tried every coconut water there is. In a can, in a carton, in glass, in a coconut... Taste Nirvana is hands down the very best there is. Still to this day I try the new products that come out for comparison, but I always waste my money & palate. I love the 16.2oz size, I just wish I could get the coconut water with aloe in this size (love the added fiber!) on Amazon. If you've ever wanted to try coconut water, but you're fearful of the taste, DRINK TASTE NIRVANA. You'll love it. I buy 5 cases a month & drink two cans a day to stay hydrated & healthy & happy!

review/text: I ordered the Nico brand before this because it seemed to have good reveiws.  Then I noticed I had the reviews sorted by best to worst instead of most recent.  Nico's was from concentrate and tasted like it.  I think Nico no has some that are not from concentrate since so many people complained.  In any regard, this one tastes like it came right from the coconut without any processing.  So, get this one if  you want pure coconut water with no surprises.

review/text: We keep coconut water around as a staple, prior to this brand, VitaCoco, as this brand was elusive. I hope to always get this one from Amazon, b/c there's something about it I like...it's the one I pick out first if I have a choice of both brands in my home stock. I'm not one who likes things overly sweet, this one is not, and it has a smooth taste, no aftertaste. I have tasted "real" coconut water and this tastes like straight from the coconut shell.  With so many brands of coconut water on the market and so many differing opinions on each one, it seems it's just a matter of personal taste, the way one likes coffee strong, or weak, or w/backnotes of flavors.  To each his or her own...but for right now, this one is more than fine by me!

review/text: I am a coconut-water-alcoholics ... I drink at least 3-5 bottles a day. I try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I">Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a>, One, and even fresh cut coconut water from Wholefood Market. Before having this, I am a fan of VitaCoco, but recently the quality of VitaCoco is really getting worse. The taste is awful... One of my friend working at facebook told me that in facebook, they offer this to employee for free and he drinks 4-5 bottle a day, and i decide to give it a try. Well... I must said that the "real fresh cut" coconut is the best, but this one is the second best in my opinion. I can assure you that any reasonable one will love this than vitacoco. A chilly one is even better.<br /><br />If you don't believe the review, just go to a market, spend 2 dollars on each major brand, and you shall see the big difference.

So creamy and rich tasting with a mild coconut flavor that wasn't too sweet, I just couldn't believe this was coconut WATER! I am a subscriber now for sure and have ordered the one with pulp to try next! After this one, I did try ECOS brand and it didn't taste as good. ECOS just wasn't as creamy and had a slightly bitter taste at first.  I can't wait to try taste nirvana's with my protein shakes, and later tonight in a cocktail with some rum! I had one last night after a night of drinking some strong sake and I gotta say, I woke up feeling great this morning too! I'm definitely going to switch my husband to this from gatorade!

review/summary: Tastes exactly like what I get when I cut into a young coconut
review/text: I really love this one... and I have tried several over the last few weeks.  The tastes have really varied with each and every one I tried and after reading all of  the reviews for the different brands, I've been struck with some realizations.  First of all... the different brands utilize coconuts from different parts of the globe.  That in and of itself would cause flavor differences.  But, the other thing that came to mind is how the same tree can produce different flavor and texture results in things like oranges and apples depending on the weather pattern for that season, etc.  Perhaps the same applies to coconuts?  In any case, of all the brands I've tried, this is by far my favorite.  I decided to try drinking coconut water to help with lowering my blood pressure and it has definitely done that.  So I am happy that I finally found one that I can happily consume and enjoy every day!

review/text: I like it a lot, but the juice tastes more like roasted coconut than fresh. In Thailand, it is common to take a fresh coconuts and roast them to naturally sweeten the juice. The ingredients do not include added sugar, so my guess is that it was roasted because the juice is sweet. I actually prefer the taste of roasted coconuts, so I like Taste Nirvana. Minus one star because the last sip out of the can tastes weird. I don't know why.<br /><br />I also had tried Vita Coco and hated it. I have had fresh coconuts all my life, since I grew up in a tropical area, but I have to say that Vita Coco doesn't taste like coconut juice. Brazil probably has a different species of coconut trees.

I received my third case of the Real Coconut Water the other day and realized the nutrition label did not match the ones from my previous two cases, the Taste Nirvana website, or anywhere else I looked online.  I contacted Taste Nirvana through their website as well as directly through email to inquire and make sure the case I got at least came from their company, and haven't heard a word.  I loathe poor customer service, and their inability to even respond is enough for me to stop purchasing and recommending their products.<br /><br />That being said, I emailed Amazon as well, who promptly refunded my order even though they can't accept back groceries.  As usual, Amazon customer service is the best out there.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, has anyone else received cans with a nutrition label stating 100 calories (vs. the 75 cals it should say), 700 mg potassium (vs. the 1000 mg it should say), etc.?  Still trying to figure out where these cans I received and drank before noticing the incorrect label came from.

review/text: This is naturally sweet and tasty, but doesn't taste like real coconut water.  Tastes vanilla-y as another reviewer has said.  This product would be great for those who don't like the taste of real coco water and want a masked taste.<br /><br />I have tried all major brands -- Zico, One, and VitaCoco.  Zico in the tetrapak comes closest to tasting like the natural product (not the Zico in the bottles, which tastes great but contains additives -- when a manufacturer changes packaging claiming improved, you can be sure something major has changed).  But I have received 2 bad cases of Zico so am leery to order it again.  Both bad batches were on sale, so beware of coco water coupons -- company may be trying to ditch stock.<br /><br />VitaCoco rates about B+ -- sometimes has a pulpy taste, like they scraped too close to the coconut shell when they extracted the juice.  The one time I tried One, I didn't like, but a friends swears by it so I should probably try again.  So I guess for now, I'll order VitaCoco by the case.<br /><br />ps.  I grew up in a tropical country and drank a LOT of coco water right out the shell.

review/text: This is the  third or forth brand of coconut water in cans that I have tasted .I dont know why coconut water in cans taste weird.<br /><br />The ones in the terapak tastes better and more natural but you can also  tell when the coconut is harvested old or not.The can ones you can not tell if it is because of a certain taste that  I dont normally taste in fresh and younger coconut water and it has an aftertaste.<br /><br />When I was back in Cebu 2011, there is a new trend with the coccnut water , that they harvest, pack on the same day and distribute it to sell in bottle water container within 24 hours and because the water turns rancid if you dont drink it if its not in the refrigerator .But sugar is added since coconut water is bland if the coconut is not very young.Even though they are not direct from the cocnut ,  they were best to none.<br /><br />Anyway ,I dont like coconut water with the aftertaste so even though the can would say all natural and real , its not.<br /><br />I wont be buying this one again.

This has to be absolutely one of the worst products that is being marketed as Real Coconut Water. The very first thing I noticed when I opened the can was a chemical odor coming from the coconut water. This was the first indication that I knew I would not enjoy this product and probably was a waste of money. The second issue I had with this product was the taste was way off when compared to real coconut water actually comes from the tree.<br /><br />This product is a real waste...Zico, One and Vita Coco are way better products.

review/text: Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water is my favorite coconut water by a long shot, and I've tried all the major brands. A lot of them have an offputting, chemical or metallic taste (hard to describe it exactly), but Taste Nirvana has the only one that to me truly tastes like the coconut water I've had straight from the coconut! There are no additives, it's pure 100% coconut water. This version is the one without pulp, which I imagine is the one that most people will enjoy (since pulp can be a problem for some people, texturally speaking).<br /><br />As I write this, these 16-oz cans are not yet available on Amazon, but you can find this coconut water at most Whole Foods, PCC, and other organic-type grocery retailers (as well as other places). As soon as they make this available on Amazon on a regular basis, I'm putting in a monthly subscription!

I'm sure the integrity of the taste is kept more pure because it's a can. Boxed juice taste different.<br /><br />And I can say this is my first amazon subscription to ANY product. I never commit to a monthly reorder system. This stuff is so good. But don't take my word for it. Try it out. I think you'll be hooked.

review/summary: No contest... this is absolutely the BEST coconut water on the market.
review/text: I am a big fan of coconut water. I have tried just about every brand available and to me this is clearly the #1 product on the market. This is the one that tastes exactly like what you get when you stick a straw into a green young coconut. Very clean, perfectly sweet, slightly nutty and good (raw) coconut flavor. Ice cold, it doesn't get any better than this. I highly recommend Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water. Enjoy!

review/summary: Surprisingly real taste
review/text: I love the water I get out of coconuts, it's my favorite treat.  I tried all the different NON-flavored coconut water brands out there, and I didn't think much of any of them, actually.  However, this was the one that stuck with me as the closest thing to real, even though it seemed too sweet and a little tame, as if it had been cooked.<br /><br />I was in a Thai restaurant and ordered coconut water as my drink.  They brought out the actual young coconut, cut off the top and slipped in a straw.  The water was identical in taste to this product.  I now order it as a subscription product.

review/text: I went through 12 cans in about a week.  Sooooo, good! I've tried this brand and v-coco, and I have to say that this one tastes about 80% better.  I'm thinking that the quality control of their coconuts must be better because they both say 100% natural with nothing added.  The cans are huge and the water has absolutely no pulp.  These cans are going to be a permanent fixture in my refrigerator.<br /><br />-D

review/summary: Better than ONE and ZICO, I think.
review/text: If you've had coconut water straight from the coconut, then you'll love Taste Nirvana's Real Coconut Water. But if you've had ONE and/or ZICO brand coconut water, you might find Taste Nirvana to be too sweet, too heavy, or both (and if you do, I'm sure ice helps mitigate that). My guess is the taste difference between all these brands stems from where the coconuts are harvested. Taste Nirvana claims to use green coconuts from Thailand. And I believe the other brands harvest from various countries, primarily Brazil. All I know is I'm damn-near addicted to Taste Nirvana's coconut water. It's just so tasty and refreshing. Doesn't hurt that it's fairly low in calories, as others have pointed out. If you're a carb counter like I tend to be, you should know that the Taste Nirvana coconut water with pulp has double the carbs of the non-pulp variety. Side note: If you're a fan of Thai iced tea, Taste Nirvana sells a pretty damn tasty Thai tea latte drink (in addition to Thai coffee). I don't see the Thai tea available on Amazon at this time, but I'm sure it's forthcoming.

review/summary: Incredibly Hooked
review/text: I tried coconut water for the first time about a month ago from an Indonesian convenience store in Los Angeles. The owner cut the top off of a real coconut and threw in a straw. Because my car's cup holders are not built for actual coconuts, I set out to find the best, most portable coconut water product on the market. Taste Nirvana has destroyed its competition in terms of taste and texture. I tried Vitacoco, Zico and O.N.E coconut water and none comes close to capturing the sweet goodness of real coconut water. Taste Nirvana absolutely does. I'm 100% hooked!

review/summary: Next best thing to a real Thai Coconut
review/text: I used to buy flats of fresh young Thai coconut from the local asian supermarket.  I used hack them to bits with a meat cleaver, to get at the tender flesh and the refreshing sweet water.  I also use to scare the bejeezus out of me because I was afraid I'd whack off my thumb.<br /><br />My point is-- I know what fresh young Thai coconut water tastes like.  I've had it in the US and I've had it in Thailand.  It's delicious.  Malty, sometimes a little "corny," hints of vanilla, never "sour," sweetness varies from coconut to coconut-- but always refreshing and delicious.<br /><br />This brand tastes the closest to drinking out of a freshly opened Thai coconut.  Is it as good as the real thing? I'd say it's 90% as good.  The flavors don't taste as "fresh" (but still yummy) and I miss the tender young coconut flesh that you can get from inside the shell.<br /><br />Still-- my wife and I go through at least two cans a day.  This is the best coconut water out of a can.

review/summary: The ONLY Packaged Coconut Water Worth Tasting
review/text: A little while back I was given a box of 12 whole young coconuts to enjoy. After a bit of practice I perfected the art of chopping the top open with a butcher's cleaver to insert a straw and suckle the sweet nectar contained within. As much fun as that was, whole coconuts take up too much space in the fridge and I'm always concerned that they must use some kind of chemicals on them to keep the "fresh" from their home in Thailand to my grocer's refrigerators.<br /><br />Without knowing really anything about the whole packaged coconut water game, I assumed very incorrectly that I could just select a container of any random brand off a store shelf and it would taste as immaculate as the perfect juice from a fresh-cracked coconut.<br /><br />I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />I first tried Vita Coco because it seems to be the most common brand really everywhere. It was even at Costco, so I bought their handy 12-pack expecting to delight in the treat. I got the tetra-pak all nice and chilled before taking my first sip, and when I did I was furious. "How can they call this coconut water?!" I exclaimed. It tastes kind of like diluted, sour, used, soapy dish water that leaves a funky wang in your mouth and does nothing toward quenching your thirst. It seemed to make me thirsty for some plain old water. Yuck!<br /><br />At first I thought maybe I got a bad batch, but then I headed online for some reviews and I found I was not alone. How unfortunate. However, I also found lots of reviews of some other brands that people seemed to love. "Yay! There's still hope!" I thought to myself.<br /><br />The confusing part was that for every brand for which I found good reviews, there seemed to be countless other reviewers disgusted by each one. I read a review comparing Zico, O.N.E., and Vita Coco to one another, and it ranked the former two far above the latter. I went ahead and bought a bottle of each Zico and O.N.E. and determined they are swill, especially Zico, which tastes like tap water that was spit into by someone who just ate a rotten coconut.<br /><br />I continued reading reviews and found several stating that Amy & Brian is really great, but that some find it overly sweet. I am not a fan of sugary sweetness in my coconut water, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. The results? Meh. It's really not sweet at all, and although there is more flavor, it still doesn't taste like fresh coconut water. Yet another review stated that Nature Factor was a close second behind Amy & Brian, so I gave that a shot. It's definitely a little worse than Amy & Brian, but it is very similar and doesn't taste like a real coconut.<br /><br />I was just about to give up hope when one of the small ~9 oz. bottles with pulp of Taste Nirvana landed in my hands. I presumed it was going to be more funky wang sauce, but I took my first sip and whoa-ho-hoooo what have we here? A miracle in a bottle? A fresh coconut shaped like a bottle? Nay, it was really bottle coconut water that really tasted like coconut water! In fact it tastes even better than fresh coconut water because there's a subtle sort of butteriness to the flavor. I thought it had to be a fluke, but I took another sip (and about finished the bottle), and every drop went down as unbelievably delicious as the first.<br /><br />I immediately hopped onto Amazon and started a subscribe & save subscription. My first case of these 16 oz. tall cans sans pulp arrived today and after a quick 1 hour in the freezer, I just tried my first can. Son of a biscuit, it almost brings me to tears to tell you this, but it was possibly the best canned beverage I've ever guzzled. I tried so hard to make it last, but I almost chugged the darned thing because the deliciousness was so unstoppable.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for some good coconut water and don't want to deal with cleaving real coconuts, save yourself a lot of time and heartache; don't try anything but Taste Nirvana. You won't regret it. I just wish I had someone else giving me this advice at the start of my misadventures in coco-hunting.

review/summary: Tastes Like Water From a Real Coconut!
review/text: I have been going through the various brands of coconut water. Taste Nirvana is now officially my favorite. One reason: it literally tastes like water right out of a coconut. If you are not a fan of coconut flavor, opt for another brand. Second reason: I like the serving size: each can has 16.2 ounces of coconut water (I found the 11 ounce containers of most other brands to be a little short when I am hot and thirsty). I also like that I can easily recycle the can in my area.<br /><br />To date the only down-side is that it is not always readily available from Amazon. Since I frequently work in the heat (which, here in Texas, runs from April to Halloween) I have to have a ready supply of coconut water. It really does quench your thirst, as well as replace depleted electrolytes.

review/text: Bought another brand when I could not find this in stores for a post run event.  Should not have even bothered!  I still don't know where this is sold anywhere except a slightly local coffee shop, so this is where I've gone before runs, and before hiking weekends.  Now it'll be delivered to my door...oh happy day.  Don't bother with anything else, this stuff is the best.  There's a refreshing sweetness that makes you question if it has been sugared up but I don't think they could call it a water if that was the case.  I'm excited to try this in smoothies or popsicles now!

review/summary: Delicious, but needs better packaging for shipping
review/text: I have tried many coconut waters lately and found this one to be very tasty and have lower calories than others like Amy & Brian's. This coconut water has a unique nuttiness that others do not.<br /><br />I must complain about the packaging of all of amazon's cans. An earlier order of Amy & Brians coconut water came smashed up, but thankfully the strong cans did not puncture. I cannot say the same about my recent order of Taste Nirvana Real Coconut water. One of the cans had been smashed / punctured and its contents drained into the box. So in the end, we only got 11 of the 12 cans we ordered, and the rest were banged up pretty badly.<br /><br />I had recently 'subscribed' to this product for shipment once a month but I'm second guessing this since amazon doesn't properly package these cans for shipping. BEWARE.<br /><br />The product is fantastic though.

review/summary: The BEST coconut water
review/text: This is my favorite coconut water, and I think I've tried almost all of them at this point (fresh is always best, but that's expensive and hard to come by). I first found Taste Nirvana in California, in the smaller glass bottles, and loved it, but couldn't find it after returning to MD. Then I found them on Facebook and subsequently on Amazon, and I have been subscribed to 2 cases per month ever since (and am upping to 3 cases). The glass one may or may not taste better, but this is a larger container and is far cheaper. Now the stores near me carry this brand, but it's still cheaper to get on Amazon, and the plain, no-pulp cans are still not available near me.

review/summary: Best Tasting
review/text: I've tried several coconut water brands ever since my trip to Tobago in 2010.  Most of what I've found in the stores was just plain bad.  Shopping at health food stores I've had more luck with brands like C2O and Blue Monkey, but this is by far the best stuff I've found.  It's sweet tasting, so if that's not your thing than skip this one.  Like all coconut water you have to drink this stuff cold, taste terrible warm.<br /><br />It baffles me, but the nutrition information on the can leads me to believe it's about twice as good for you as my second favorite brand.  I'm not sure if I 100% believe it, maybe different measurement techniques or something; both have the same single ingredient: 100% young Thai coconut water.  Who knows.<br /><br />It's also not cheap, fortunately there is prime shipping on this.  I'd say overall it's a good deal considering how heavy this is to ship, so the price is justified in my mind.  At a little over $2/can, it's about what you'd pay at a whole foods, etc.<br /><br />It's worth noting that the large cans in other brands are typically *slightly* larger than this one (maybe 17 ounces), but it's hardly worth noting that.<br /><br />Final analysis: if you like sweet coconut water I think this is really the best brand to go for.

review/summary: My Preferred Green Coconut Water
review/text: Taste Nirvana is my preferred coconut water (although, Zico is a close second). Yes, it does have a slight vanilla taste but it's vague and not overpowering. Sweetness level is good, like drinking a light fruit juice. Like other fruits and vegetables, coconut waters are going to taste different depending upon what region of the world and variety they come from. I prefer Thai sourced coconut waters (both Taste Nirvana and Zico come from there). If you find a water you like try other brands from the same country (I believe most others come from Brazil).<br /><br />I enjoy drinking it as a healthier alternative to sodas or the more sugary fruit juices (I don't consider it a wonder drug). It's especially nice on hot days when you want a lighter beverage but with more flavor than plain water.<br /><br />If it were cheaper I'd drink it everyday.

review/text: I buy for an organic grocer and I've tried probably 10 different brands of coconut water (Zico, Naked, Vita Coco, Blue Monkey, UFC, Coco2, etc.) and this is the best tasting one, if you're into the taste of a real coconut. I've sampled coconut water straight out of a coconut that was just picked in countries like Thailand and Vietnam and this is pretty much as close as it gets. Other coconut waters are fine and refreshing and some are sweeter than others (Blue Monkey is the sweetest) but "Taste Nirvana" has a milky coconut taste without actually being milky. I drink this stuff almost daily and I've subscribed to the frequent buyer program via Amazon and it's totally worth. Buy and try it, you won't regret it. I try new ones often, so I'll update if I find one I like better.

review/text: This coconut water is, by far, the only coconut water I'll drink. I've tried Vita Coco, Zico, and Naked and could not have been more disappointed. I couldn't even get myself to take another sip of any of those three brands. Then, my fiancee just so happened to buy Taste Nirvana and I tried a sip and could not believe the difference. All this time I thought I hated coconut water, and all along it was because I wasn't drinking the right kind! It has such a mild, sweet taste that is so refreshing. In fact, I have multiple health conditions that leave me susceptible to dehydration and this coconut water does a wonderful job of keeping me hydrated and healthy. I am SO happy and relieved to find a healthy replacement to Gatorade (which is basically just sugar water) and of course, an alternative to plain water, which gets boring at times. Absolutely love it, and would highly recommend it to everybody.

Each one was better than the next.  All i can say is it is delicious and smells great as you are about to drink it. And after a hard workout, it is well, Nirvana. :-)<br /><br />Then i bought these cans, and while they are not EXACTLY as perfect as the bottles for taste and purity, they are very very good and i would stay with the cans since they are almost twice the amount but cost less.<br /><br />My question is, " Do these cans leech out chemicals of any type".  I have gone to glass for all my water now and someone told me i was nuts to use cans if i had made that switch from plastic to glass.  What is the story on the cans leeching and are the bottle healthier?<br /><br />All answers are appreciated.

I opened up Vita Coco, and nearly gagged. The after-taste was that of grapes and garbage. So, yesterday, I tried Zico. Same thing! I was starting to feel that coconut water was just not for me.  Last ditch effort, I saw Taste Nirvana and grabbed a bottle on my way to work this morning....<br /><br />Wow! Finally! My expectations were more than met. It's so delicious, I wish I had bought more than just one bottle. Jumped on amazon and just subscribed for the monthly plan. Taste Nirvana is so velvety smooth, and just the perfect amount of sweetness. No gross after-taste. Just...coconuts! (what a concept!)<br /><br />Third time's a charm? :)

review/summary: Good coconut water
review/text: I love coconut water. The best are the fresh young coconuts. I recently discovered that i could get them from the market for 1.99 each, which is roughly the same amount of fluids with this product if not more. Plus you get the delicious young coconut meat.<br />This product really isn't bad at all but if possible, you should just get fresh young coconuts.

review/summary: Sweet
review/text: I've tried many coconut waters.  I've decided this is my favorite.  It tastes like coconut, sweet, not once or twice like many other coconut waters.  It has relatively low calories for coconut water.

review/summary: Wow, totally different from VitaCoco, but better!
review/text: I have subscription to VitaCoco from Amazon, so used to drink coconut water that is sourced in Brazil. I wanted to something different so I tried this for the first time. The coconut water from Thailand tastes a lot different, and personally I like this better than VitaCoco. VitaCoco has clearer taste while this is somewhat milky. I love the size of the can at 16.2 oz instead of &lt;12 oz. I think VitaCoco gives you more refreshing taste when you are really thirsty, though.

review/text: I like the VitaCoco water and this one tastes different but it's just as good if not better. It tastes like the TasteNirvana in the glass bottles.<br />There's no metal or plastic taste, just good cocowater.

review/summary: Just like the real thing!
review/text: I went to the Phillipines when I was 16 and drank straight from a fresh (green) coconut...it was heavenly and I never forgot it.  When coconut waters started coming out in the US, I tried them all...and hated them - so fake tasting!  Fast forward to April 29, 2012,.,I had just given birth to our first child and my hubby grabbed me one of these (albeit in a glass bottle, which I do prefer) from the hospital Au Bon Pain.  I grimaced because of history of trials, but was so thirsty I went for it.  Wow!  I felt like the character in Ratatouille when he is instantly transported (in his minds eye) to his childhood kitchen with his Moms cooking) except I was 11 years younger in the Phillipines drinking out of a coconut with a straw.  It is that good.  Also great during breastfeeding...or after playing a sport (according to my husband) because of the potassium!  Now I get two cases delivered monthly, hahaha!

review/summary: Great product but not in the can.
review/text: I love this coconut water. Other waters are too bitter. This one is perfectly sweet. I usually get the glass bottles but the cans were on sale at my local store. I was sad to find that the canned coconut waters were not as good. There is definitely a funky taste to them that is almost unpleasant. I can see where other low reviewers are coming from. I'll stick to the glass bottled coconut waters from now on.

review/summary: Did you not fully enjoy that first sip? Put it on ice...delicious!
review/text: Quick Review: Serve with ice for most enjoyment! :)<br /><br />This product is very genuine. I appreciate that it comes from the sweetest, young coconuts in Thailand.  The taste surely shows. One thing that might throw new customers off, is the sweet, almost nutty, taste. Especially, if one is comparing it to other coconut water brands. I actually liked vitaco's 100% pure product more, even after the first time I tried Taste Nirvana's Real Coconut. However, I recently decided vitaco wasn't worth it, as I always seemed to get chapped lips from it. (weird, I know). The smell and sweeter taste of TN was a bit too much for my sensory system this morning.  The smell was familiar, not pungent. But I just couldn't put a name on it, until later today.  A tad parched from exercise and working 12 hours, I felt like I couldn't get hydrated. Then I remembered that I stashed Taste Nirvana's bottle back in the fridge this morning. So in an effort to "feel better," I gave it another shot this evening.<br /><br />Firstly, the familiar smell I noticed prior, smells a lot like Thai tea.  Perhaps it is the packaging retaining the smell, or just the sweetened flavor, from the young coconuts. The taste was superb, when served in a glass with ice.  The consistency is smoother than vitaco's, and I don't report any chapped lips with TN. ;)

review/text: I can't expand much on what's been said except this is very good coconut water.  I've tried all the major brands and while many taste good, this has great taste and doesn't come from concentrate or have any extra additives.  It's just coconut water in a big can at a great price.

review/summary: Cheaper on Amazon than Seattle Met Market sale price....
review/text: I hate drinking water, but I know I have to.  And I don't want a bunch of sugar and stuff I can't pronounce.<br /><br />This is my new favorite discovery.  I tried a few brands and this and ONE are my two besties so far.  And if you think it's expensive - my 2 can a day habit is cheaper and better for me than my previous voracious - and satisfyingly toxic- and crazy expensive - coffee addiction.<br /><br />I was buying it from Metropolitan Market in Seattle at 2 for $5 on sale, but just signed up for subscribe and save on Amazon and I'm getting it a bit cheaper, plus delivered to my door (thank you Prime Shipping!) by the case.<br /><br />Looking forward to all of the "my, you're looking well hydrated!!!" comments that I'm sure to get in the coming weeks....
