review/summary: OMG! One of the best!!!
review/text: I ran out of my kcups and target had these on clearance and I figured I would buy 2 boxes and if I didn't like it I would tuff it out until I was out to get more. So I tried these and they are one of the best!! I actually ran back and bought more. I am really not a fan when it comes to pumkin but this has a nice taste to it!! The best part is that I didnt have to add any sugar to make it sweet I just added my usual half and half save the calories!! I highly recommend this kind expecially great during the holidays!

review/summary: Try it with Pumpkin Spice Coffee Mate Creamer
review/text: I enjoy the fall and anything pumpkin.  I did not think this flavor was weak, but I may not be a good person to ask because Starbucks strength coffee makes me gag.  My taste buds are happy stopping in for a WaWa or Royal Farms flavored coffee and creamer.  If you have similar tastes, and like pumpkin pie, you'll enjoy this coffee, especially during October/November.  Coffee Mate puts out a Pumpkin Spice creamer that I use with it and it's sinfully good!  I will probably be happy to move on to other flavors come December, but for now I'm lovin' life.

The cup I had this morning, I added 3 teaspoons of sugar and the taste was better, but still not one of the better varieties out there. I think a mix with more coffee would have helped. If you've already bought this variety I recommend brewing it with the smallest cup setting. Peace out

review/summary: Terrible....possibly the worst ever
review/text: I tried this flavor 2 years ago right after I bought my first Keurig machine.  It had a good smell but the taste was completely awful.  It was so heavy on the cloves that it obliterated everything else.  The pumpkin flavor was barely discernable as was any other spice...where are the cinnamon and nutmeg flavors?  There was nothing I could do to make this kcup palatable.  I tried flavored creamers, syrups, whipped cream, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I mixed it with other kcups (french vanilla, caramel drizzle, obsidian, french and italian roasts).  The result was it ruined my favorite flavors/brews! I had to toss the last few kcups and the box (after a year of it sitting on my shelf and taunting me).  I would not let anyone else drink this vile swill.  I found one recently hiding in my storage draw that I no longer use for kcups.  I resisted the urge to beat it with a baseball bat and just tossed it in the garbage.  Top 3 worst ever:  Pumpkin spice, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya (another spice problem), and Folger's Vanilla Biscotti (incredibly artificial).  Honorable mention goes to Caribou Mahogany.  Trust me on this...NEVER try a coffee that describes it's taste as leather and tobacco. Sometimes, there actually IS truth in advertising! If you want good pumpkin coffee, run out and buy the Dunkin Donuts kcup.  It's everything the green mountain pumpkin spice should have been....smooth, balanced, a hint of spice and you can actually taste the pumpkin.

review/summary: Bad Buy
review/text: I think that, unless there has been a change in the recipe, people who rate this product highly are confusing aroma with flavor.  This "coffee" has a wonderful aroma as it brews, but it has no taste at all.  In fact, while I can smell the pumpkin spice, I can not distinguish the taste of this stuff from simple hot water.  To give it any flavor at all, I need to add a creamer and/or some sugar to it, or maybe even a little brandy.  That is a very bad thing (not the brandy), since I like my coffee black without any additives at all.<br /><br />If Green Mountain wants to make a mild "flavored" coffee rather than a medium or bold flavor, that's ok, but the very least they should do is use their breakfast blend as a starting point and work from there with their various spices. Until then, I'm sorry, but as much as I would like to do so, I can not recommend this product to anyone who likes the taste of coffee.

review/summary: It's okay
review/text: I really enjoy my coffee, but usually do not like flavored coffees.  (I'm actually a bit of a snob with my coffee, getting fresh-roasted beans, using my french press, raising my nose at drip makers...  yet sometimes I do find the convenience of a single-serve Keurig cup irresistible, and not bad at all in a pinch).  The one exception to my "no flavored coffees" is SB's Pumpkin Spice Latte.  YUM.  So, I was tempted by this and tried it.<br /><br />It definitely smells better than it tastes.  The smell takes you right back to SB's Latte and sets your expectations high.  The taste, well, not so much.  It's that typical discourse between smell and taste that makes me not like flavored coffee to begin with.<br /><br />But the truth is I will likely come back and have one of these every now and again... it's just not as good as I was hoping.  The fact that a flavored coffee gets any respect from me at all should actually be considered a "win", so take that for what it's worth.  If you dig flavored coffee as a rule, I wouldn't be surprised if you loved this.  And even if you aren't usually a flavored coffee person, if you like the P.S. Latte, you may make an exception for this.

Most of the comments were  "I hate this stuff, where did you get it , I like things with pumpkin but I cannot taste any pumpkin"  Long story short,  with my family, I wasted my money trying to give them a treat.. instead it turned into a sad trick.  Not for me and mine.. but  perhaps that is why Baskin Robbins has 30+ flavors of ice cream ?

I highly recommend a pumpkin spice creamer (which they always sell this time of year anyway) if you want to truly replace the Starbucks experience.<br /><br />Is it weak? In flavor, no. In potency, yes. This would make a good evening coffee to share with company or a relaxing cup in the middle of the day. It wouldn't be my first choice for the morning wake-up. I don't see any reason why that should take away from this coffee's quality, however. It's a flavored coffee; if you want strong, you generally don't look to these flavored blends anyway.

review/text: I waited with baited breath for the larger packs of the Pumpkin Spice to come and I preordered the minute I saw it... But this; this is NOT the same Pumpkin Spice coffee that I am used to drinking from Green Mountain. This is a WEAK WATERED DOWN Pumpkin Spice and I AM NOT HAPPY... I will NOT order this again. I will NOT recommend this purchasing option.

review/text: I always enjoy Starbucks PSL's so I thought this was going to be a great buy.  Mistake I made is I bought a lot of this.  Did not like the taste at all.  Seems like its too much spice not enough pumpkin.  I have been adding flavored creamers to this coffee just so they don't go to waste.  It helps.  Won't buy this again and won't buy so many without tasting  first.  My bad.

review/text: I love this coffee - it is so flavorful and really makes you feel like fall/winter. It is a light roast, so if you are looking for bold, you will have to seek it elsewhere. That being said, I feel that a heavier roast would overpower the delicious and subtle pumpkin spice flavor. This coffee is my personal favorite - I hoard it during the season, mourn its loss when I run out, and wait in delighted anticipation for it to come out next year!

review/summary: Great flavored coffee, but not for everyday
review/text: This is one of my family's favorite flavored coffee.  However, it is not very strong, and thus I chose the second smallest cup on my Keurig coffee maker.  If I want a large cup, I find I need to use 2.  Also, after I've had it 4-5 days in a row, I get tired of it, and need to switch to a regular coffee for a few days.  That being said, we keep ordering it, and Amazon has the best prices.

Heretical!<br /><br />So I do not know what prompted me to buy it at the local grocery store, but I did.<br /><br />Who knew that pumpkin pie spices went so well with coffee?! But they do.<br /><br />So I bought 5 more boxes at the local grocery store. And now I find them on amazon. And they are cheaper.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this coffee at least once, before making any conclusions.<br /><br />Apparently one cannot judge a book by its cover either. Intriguing!

We have purchased this several times and keep coming back for more. Unlike Hazelnut (which tens to be too sweet) this is a nicely robust coffee, with a touch of spice that you might expect in a pumpkin pie and tastes wonderful. Being an avid coffee drinker this one gets a hearty thumbs up.

review/summary: Not the strongest coffee, but a nice fall flavor
review/text: Generally if coffee has flavor, I prefer it to be sweet rather than spicy (I do not even like cinnamon flavored coffee or creamers), so I was a bit unsure how pumpkin flavor would blend with coffee.  It is actually a nice blend.  The pumpkin and spice flavors, while apparent, are not overpowering and blend well with the coffee, rather than competing with it.  It smells wonderful, and if I could pump the smell through the house 24/7, I would.<br /><br />The coffee itself is a bit on the weaker side.  I realize that flavored coffee is not going to have the same bold flavor as a dark roast, but this is weaker than other flavors I have tried (and there have been many!). As with most k-cups, I recommend brewing on the smallest setting.  The smallest setting on my Keurig is 6 ounces; if your model has a smaller size setting, I would suggest trying it.  It is definitely worth picking up a box if you enjoy the flavors of fall.

review/text: I sampled Green Mountain's pumpkin spice coffee and was immediately hooked. It's a lighter roast but still not washed out, but best of all the cinnamon and clove flavor comes through at just the right intensity. So now I get the luxury of a pumpkin spice latte by adding warm skim milk and save all those sugar calories! What I especially love about this blend is that the clove comes through nicely. It's not overpowering but you can distinctly make it out. I love that, and if you love clove too I think you'll love it as much as I do.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: I bought this through Amazon because the Keurig site didn't have any available.  The prices were about the same as if I bought it here or on the Keurig site but my wife has been waiting for some time for this product to come out again.  She's mentioned it's the closest thing to the Pumpkin Spice Latte that Starbucks gives but personally I don't like that type of stuff so I'll go on her word about it. :)  I'm truthfully happy that Amazon had this item.<br /><br />The only thing bad about this product was that I was expecting the the K-Cups to be organized in their smaller boxes and when I got it, they were flung every which way in the box.  I made sure the count was 50 and moved on, but to not really have much storage space (with the exception of the pull out storage drawer and a spindle, both already full of my favorites) I had to put this big box right beside my Keurig.... it truly takes up counter space but because my wife likes it alot, I don't think it will be a problem.

review/summary: Didn't Blow My Hair Back
review/text: We are huge Green Mountain fans and excitedly ordered this coffee earlier this month, but I must admit that it doesn't have a true, what I would call, "pumpkin spice" flavor.  It's more like nutmeg and cinnamon flavored water.  I tend to like bolder coffee (I'm a Double Black Diamond gal), and was thinking that this is why I was let down, but my husband (who is a Breakfast Blend guy) didn't like it either.  I compared the flavor of this coffee to some coffee that we purchased in a local store, which was also entitled, "Pumpkin Spice," and the other coffee was way more rich with pumpkiny flavor than this one.  I will most likely finish the box but I'm not clamoring for it every morning.  Hey maybe I'll offer it to unsuspecting guests!  If you're just looking for something seasonal, it might be a good buy.  But if you're a purist and expect the flavors to run deep, you might want to look elsewhere.

review/summary: Great fall flavor
review/text: This K-Cup flavor is fantastic! I have had K-Cup flavors in the past and have been disappointed but not with this one. The pumpkin spice flavor is not overpowering and is light in intensity. Both the wife & I love it and we plan on placing another order.

review/summary: Not much flavor
review/text: I was a little disapointed in this one.  It really lacked in flavor and was a very weak coffee.  I could barely taste the pumpkin spice flavor.  I would not recommend this perticular brand of pumpkin spice if you are a fan of the flavor as I am.

review/summary: Takes like hot water - no flavor
review/text: My wife recently purchased a pack of these K-Cups.  First my wife tried one on the normal cup setting (the one in the middle) and the cup that was produced tasted like hot water with just a hint that there might be some flavor.  So she turned it all the way down to the smallest cup with the same result.  My wife did try one more again a few days later and got a good cup so I went for it.  And again the same result, a regular size cup that was horrible, then another tiny cup that was horrible.  I won't be buying these again.  Perhaps Green Mountain doesn't care but $18.00 is a lot of money to literally poor down the drain, but I do.

review/summary: Disappointed in flavor this year.
review/text: I bought this product last year, and it was great. I anxiously awaited the release of it this season, and when I got it, was very disappointed by how weak it is. It was a rich full coffee last year. This year, although there is a good pumpkin spice flavor,the coffee itself is weak.

review/text: Like others have said it is very weak. I would mix it in with something else but it might cut the pumpkin spice and that part actually tastes ok. It does say on the top of the K-cup "light roast coffee" (but not on Amazon description that I could find) so buyer beware.

review/summary: Great for at home, but doesn't compare to coffee houses
review/text: I really like the Pumpkin spice K Cups. I think they are a great seasonal flavor. I bought the pack for fall and I have enjoyed them.<br /><br />The other day I went to a coffee house and got a cup of pumpkin spice coffee and the amount of spice in it was much more than the k cup. Since then, I the K cups just seem watered down.<br /><br />So it's a great product for at home, but doesn't compare with a coffee house pumpkin spice.

review/summary: Very Weak Flavor
review/text: This K-cup was included in a "Fall Mix" that I purchased. I was disappointed when I saw that there was only one in the mix but I soon got over it as soon as I took a sip. It taste like Spiced Water... barely any coffee at all. Maybe it would be alright on the espresso setting on the Keurig but not the BIG cup.

review/summary: Delicious Light Spicy Flavor
review/text: I came across this particular flavor at a local store quite by accident. If you are a bold/strong coffee person, it may be too light on "coffee" flavor as cited in some of the reviews, but if you accept it on its own merit instead of expecting a bold coffee flavor, it's a delicious light spicy flavor. I love it. I will definately stock up on a few boxes to hide in the pantry for the rest of the year since it is a limited edition. I brewed mine with 8 ounces of water and added a touch of milk. With every sip, I keep saying "mmmm delicious". This definately gave a good mood boost to my day.

review/text: I really enjoy this flavor.  Green Mountain typically has the best coffee, in my opinion, and this doesn't disappoint.  The pumpkin spice is noticeable but not overwhelming.  The only downside is that the coffee itself is a light roast and I feel the spice flavor would go better with a medium roast.  However, you can't go wrong with this choice, it's a must have for the season!

review/text: I wait all year for the Pumpkin Spice K-Cups to arrive. I am very glad that Amazon offers such a large quantity so cheap! 50 count sounds like a lot, but if you love Pumpkin Spice then you will find them disappearing quite fast! The taste is great, my favorite is Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Lattes from their coffee houses, but this is my second favorite drink ever! Pair it with some pumpkin spice creamer found at your local grocery store and you have a delicious drink! I don't care for these without creamer, but I love sugar so... super price and a great product!

review/summary: Good pumpkin spice flavor, but pretty weak
review/text: This coffee smells great and has a nice pumpkin flavor to it (as advertised), but it brews very weak in a Keurig.  I am not sure if it is just the roast of the bean or simply the pure quantity of grounds that were packaged in these specific k-cups, but I like my coffee stronger, with a bit more of a punch.  This would be perfect and a bit more flavorful if it didn't taste as weak/watered down. :(

review/summary: Gave me a boost when I needed it
review/text: I had a very long day. Got to work early, worked about nine hours, headed for the airport and had to go through a connecting flight and about 5 hours of travel. And when I got home I still had some work to do and needed a boost to get me through it.<br /><br />After hearing a radio ad for this product, I picked up a two-pack and used one of them when I got home.<br /><br />It promised five hours of energy without crashing. I can't attest to the five hours (didn't quite pay attention), but it did last for quite a while and I had no crash effect in the end. I wasn't overly anxious or nervous, but I could think clearly and get the work done that I needed to get done. So it most definately delivers on its promises.<br /><br />The things that I like the most is the fact that there is no sugar. I also appreciate the fact that they use water instead of carbonated water, which is the main reason I don't like the Monsters, Rockstar, Red Bull, etc products (diet versions, of course). It also gives all this energy in 2 ounces instead of having to drink a large soda can worth of drink. The taste wasn't fantastic, but it could have been much worst and only takes a good gulp to get it all down.<br /><br />I've been looking for a product like this to get me going in the mornings and this seems to fit the bill. My only problem with this is that it is a bit on the pricey side. Today I am also trying out one that is similar, called Enduroshot, a 2.2 ounce energy shot that claims all the same benefits that this promises but at a MUCH lower price. I'll do a review on that sometime soon in the future. If I feel just as awake and alert as I do with 5-hour energy, then I will use it instead. Otherwise, Chaser has a new, steady customer.
