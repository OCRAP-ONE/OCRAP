review/text: Love the wheaty taste of McVitie's! They are not too sweet, so it may be surprising to people who are used to the intensive sweetness of cookies from the US. You can feel the fibers in these cookies, and they are just perfect to have with a cup of PG Tips tea!

review/summary: Made a great cake
review/text: These crackers were called for in a recipe for a no bake cake so I ordered them on Amazon.  Some of the reviews stated that the crackers arrived broken, which would not have mattered for my purposes.  However, they all arrived intact.  No shipping issues whatsoever.  I did not use all the crackers in the cake and am enjoying them as a cracker!  Very good!!  Cake was fabulous.

review/text: These are really good, not to sweet and great texture.  The 5 stars is for the product, because mine arrived like the picture above with a few pillows, not enough to keep things from roaming in the box. All had crumbs in them, but I saved them in an airtight container for later use.<br />Amazon what's up with the packers?  I received a case of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V0PXNU">Bisto Gravy Granules for Chicken - 12pk x 170g</a> and they were shrink wrapped together and had so many pillows an ant could not get in, nothing short of stepping on them could hurt these anyway. So why are the fragile cookies left to roll around in the box???

review/summary: These biscuits are a staple in my home
review/text: I'm originally from Singapore, and I used to have these for tea-time (around 4 in the afternoon) with my family (a common practice back where I'm from). When we moved to the States seven years ago, I looked all over for these tea biscuits and finally found them at an upscale grocery store, selling for much more than its retailing on this site. I've been buying it from the grocers all this while mainly because I'm concerned at the packaging issues mentioned by many reviewers here.<br /><br />These biscuits, though extremely tasty (sweet but not overly so, and great for dunking), are also prone to crumbling. The mildest pressure will see the biscuit crumble into itty bitty little pieces so if this is being shipped to customers, the packaging has to be able to protect the biscuits and prevent crumbling. The biscuits themselves are superior in quality and taste, no complaints!

review/summary: Tasty but broken
review/text: These cookies are very tasty.  Mildly sweet & satisfying.  However, they arrived shrink wrapped to one flat piece of cardboard & a lot of the cookies were broken & basically all of them were damaged around the edges.  These cookies have a scalloped edge & by the time they arrived at our door all of the scallops were in crumbles.  We've discovered that the crumbles make an excellent crunchy topping for ice cream sundaes, but we're disappointed that these cookies didn't arrive in good enough condition to serve to guests.

review/summary: Excellent product, very addictive, great flavor 3 varieties
review/text: I love McVitte's Digestives, plain or with milk chocolate or dark chocolate topping.  This brand of biscuit, as they are called in England, are a cookie with a slightly less sweet taste than American cookies.  They have a malty wheat germ taste that no other cookie/biscuite has. The closest thing we have would be the Graham Cracker.  The name of the biscuit, Digestive,  is as distinctive as the taste.<br />While they are great for dunking, ya got to be fast! They soak up hot tea or milk like a dry sponge.  If you are not fast enough it will break off into your beverage pretty fast.  It's a game I love to play and quite addicting.  Usually Amazon.com has the best deals available for most English foods.  Check on some of the subscriptions for food and you'll find even lower prices.<br />No, I don't work for either company.<br />I am however as English as Winston Churchill and have lived in England several times in Suffolk County. Very beautiful part of England.

review/text: We were looking for a good-quality tea biscuit and searched Amazon for some with favorable reviews. These seemed to fit the bill so we ordered some. They are simply a perfect biscuit. They are tender and flaky and absorb tea without falling apart (as long as you dunk them quickly). I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a delicious biscuit.

The perfect dunkable for your tea or hot chocolate on a cold winter's evening in front of the fire...or even with your coffee in the morning.  They have a nice firm texture - so they don't disintegrate when you dunk them - and a mild flavor, not too sweet. Soothing and yummy...I'm addicted!

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: Excellent product, slightly different than anything available in the U.S. Digestives Biscuits (cookies)are only slightly sweet with a wheat-malt kind of taste.  They are super with a cup of PG Tips tea and a biscuit I would recommend along with other McVities products for informal entertaining.  One warning! OK two.  If you use a Digestive (the name doesn't do it justice) to dunk in your coffee or tea, be QUICK!!! They are actually light and crisp and soak up liquid faster than a Bounty Paper Towel. You'll be fishing out big chunks of soggy cookie.  I've somewhat mastered the art of being a Digestives dunker, but once in a while I have to get a spoon.  The McVities come in three flavors (or flavours) plain, with milk chocolate coating and one with dark chocolate coating.  ALL ARE GOOD! Warning number two: My problem is once I open a packet of McVities, they usually don't last the whole day, even if I'm home alone. They are that good.

review/text: I've very glad that Amazon and other companies are making more English foods available in the U.S. McVities make a high quality product and slightly a bit different than many of the similar products sold here. The years the I spent in England McVities was my favorite brand of biscuits (cookies).<br />Through some Amazon.com deals you can get a good price, but shop carefully, not all prices on Amazon.com are the best. But if it says McVities, it should be good.  While you're at it get some PG Tips Tea bags, now you've got a great way to relax.

These are the best biscuits but unfortunately very very bad packing. these are pretty brittle and it breaks easily, this time i got with about 5 of the packs almost fully crushed, 3 were total powdered. I would never take it again from amazon, i get it way cheaper in indian groceries, just that stock there keeps getting over and i have to find the right time to get it . but it is better than eating powder.  So somehow review is complicated, since the product is good and amazon has nothing to do with it, the only thing amazon has to do is handling and shipping, which is very badly done. So unfortunately my bad rating will affect the product, but please remember this is a good product, i am giving bad rating for amazon handling and shipping ONLY.

review/summary: Naturally delicious treat!
review/text: These hard candies are absolutely delicious.  I particularly like giving them to the children because they do not contain any dyes.  They look at them strangely at first because of the peculiar color but once they taste them, they simply love them.  I suffer from chronic dry mouth so I always keep GoNaturally Organic Hard Candies in my pocket or purse.  Cherry is my favorite but lemon and apple are also quite tasty. Great value for the price.

review/summary: You gotta try these candies!!!
review/text: I can no longer tolerate 'sugar-free' candies because the sugar alcohols bother my stomach. I love hard candies but couldn't find an all natural, flavorful sour cherry, you know, a good ole' fashioned sour cherry hard candy!!  FOUND IT.  Love these so much I have them on monthly auto-delivery.

review/summary: One of the best candies I've ever had
review/text: These are just wonderful.  I particularly appreciated them when I was living in Los Angeles and subject to incredibly long, stressful, dusty, dry commutes.  One doesn't want to drink anything (and end up having to find a restroom); but the climate is so dry, polluted and filled with dust etc. that it is very hard on the throat.  These were by far the best hard candies I ever found for such an application, and I would highly recommend them for road trips (or any trips).  Not only do they taste great, but they don't leave your mouth feeling raw, like some hard candies will.<br /><br />They are also great to use in place of cough drops when you have a cold or the flu.  They aren't medicated; but the organic ingredients and pleasantly strong flavors are very soothing, especially if you feel sick to your stomach trying to use regular cough drops.  I much prefer them to my old favorite Ricola cough drops.<br /><br />But besides practical applications, these are just great candies.  I personally like to keep two flavors on hand, cherry and pomegranate.  They seem to last indefinitely, and the waxy papery individual wrappers hold up well in one's handbag, car, pocket, or etc.  They are made with barley syrup, which is how hard candies were originally made in "the old days", and this lends a distinctive interest, depth and complexity to the overall flavor that is lacking in most other hard candies.  It's extremely subtle but the positive difference is apparent.  The only slight issue (which is true with all hard candies, and these seemed less inclined to the problem) is that they can become just slightly sticky if exposed to humid conditions over time.  Not as bad as most hard candies, and not so bad that you can't get the wrappers off or don't want to eat them; but just a little stickiness around the surface.<br /><br />Everyone that I've shared these with has liked them.  Of course, it depends on if you like the specific flavor of the variety you pick.

review/text: I was disappointed in the lack of actual cherry taste.  They taste good, but they don't really taste very cherry to me. They taste sweet.  You can't tell they are sweetened by fruit juice only.  They pretty much taste like any regular hard candy.  I'm not completely disappointed in them, but I won't buy them again.

review/text: I bought this instead of another brand because I read a review that the other brand was packaged in China.  I am afraid of anything made in China because of quality concerns.  This company is located in Norway, Iowa.  I visited their website and was satisfied that they do value quality, organic standards, and fair trade.  This product is good.  A bit too powdery making it seem a bit too processed.  Otherwise I would have given it five stars.

They are definitely very heavy on 'calories from fat' but keep me full much longer than a regular cereal bar. The best part I like about these bars is that they are not extra sugary and have the right amount of sugar to just remove the blandness of the nuts. LOVE IT.

review/summary: Fresh Nutty & Fruity On the Go Snack
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised that this bar actually tasted like a handful of fresh nuts & fruit. Usually snack, protein or energy bars taste chemically. Not this one. It would be a convenient food to take to eat on-the-go. But, be warned. It's a bit on the sticky side (and I didn't carry it in the sun or in a car...). So either bring along a moist towelette or use a squirt of those towel free hand sanitizers to eliminate sticky finger syndrome. I'd suggest not eating this particular bar while driving because of that. The calories were not too high for this class of food product (190) and the sodium wasn't obnoxious (20mg - I've seen worse), but I wish they'd get the sugars to under 9g (they're 12g). While I wouldn't eat these bars every day, for nutritional & calorie reasons, it's a brand I'll keep on hand for quick emergency hunger fixes.

Some people were complaining that the nuts in the bars were a bit stale. I didn't run across that problem, but they were sticky (just pop them in the fridge and they should be fine). You can buy them at kroger but they are much cheaper at amazon (almost half the price if you get a subscription).<br />I also had the dark chocolate cherry bar but I didn't buy it from amazon. It's really sweet and not to my liking. It's a good replacement if you normally eat a candy bar but that's just my opinion.<br />Go order some you won't regret it.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: They taste like Mr. Goodbars, but less chocolatey.  Halfway between a crunchy and a chewy granola bar.  They make a quick, easy and tasty breakfast with no gluten or dairy.  Will definitely continue to purchase.

review/summary: healthy treat
review/text: This bar is the perfect snack for late afternoon or whenever you feel lethargic or hungry, especially when you know you are eating something good for your body. I guess they are a bit expensive, but for a product that has added antioxidants, and is gluten free, i guess that's about right. At least Amazon offers a great discount.

review/summary: Should be called "Peanut bar with Almonds and Other Nuts"
review/text: While this bar (Almond Walnut Macadamia with Peanuts) is really tasty, I was surprised by the misleading description because Peanuts are actually the first ingredient (you have to lift the marketing flap on the packaging to discern the actual ingredients), yet they say "Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein with Peanuts". Their description would tend to let you think peanuts are way down on the list. Shame on you - how Kind is that? Just rename it for what it is.

review/summary: Kind Bars
review/text: Kind bars are awesome.  I'm a hiker, figure skater and I also travel quite a bit with my job.  I prefer KIND bars for hiking because they are GOOD.  So often hiking food in general is loaded with salt just to give it taste and then it's still not very good.  I actually crave Kind bars.  They are good energy for skating and excellent to throw in before a meeting or take on the airplane in case I'm delayed.  Just good stuff and gluten free.

review/summary: YUM
review/text: I didn't buy this product off Amazon (sorry, guys!) but I normally buy it at school for a quick and mostly healthy snack in between classes. I'm surprised at all the negative reviews. I am a very picky eater and I really like these bars. They  satisfy my craving for something sweet while still being healthy. I also love the fact that one bar really fills me up, as it normally takes 2 fruit or granola bars to do the same.

review/summary: Love these bars!
review/text: I discovered these bars some time ago at my local grocery store - they were on this little display with some other things. The next time I went there, I couldn't find them. And I couldn't really remember what they were called. So, I was very excited when I saw them at Starbucks probably a year later. They are, of course, way too expensive there! I wasn't able to find them reliably anywhere around town, so I found them online and now I have two boxes (two different flavors) auto-shipped to me from Amazon. Now I have begun to see these in stores more often so I've been trying some other flavors.<br /><br />I used to eat Kashi cereal each morning but now I have one of these bars with my requisite Dr. Pepper. I'm not sure how long ago I changed my breakfast choice, but I have lost about 15 pounds (that needed to be lost) since I changed over to the bars. I definitely didn't change earlier than November, 2010. And, instead of being starving at 11 a.m., I don't get seriously hungry until later.*<br /><br />* These claims have not been evaluated by anyone, and no animals have been tortured to prove them.

review/summary: Too sticky, messy
review/text: The bar is a sticky mess inside a wrapper that can't be pulled away from the "bar".  The flavor is good, but much of the contents remain stuck to the wrapper.  If you do manage to pull the wrapping away, the contents sag and fall apart.  I have had other Kind bars and liked them, but will not buy this variety again.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: Nuts. 500mg of Omega-3. The package has all the appeal of an average healthy snack bar. It also touts Non GMO ingredients, and they donate 5% of their profits to PeaceWorks Foundation. Bonus. So, I picked up a few on close-out at my local grocer.<br /><br />Made in Australia, stored on a shelf, put on close-out, and traveled around in my bag for awhile... not even close to expiration, but still... it has been around.  I expected a mediocre nut bar. Not so. It's so good I felt compelled to look online for more.<br /><br />Looking over the ingredients list, nothing stands out as "The Flavor" that makes these so tasty, so I'll just leave it at that. Simple, sweet and soft, crunchy and flavorful. I wish I would have bought the rest of the ones I saw on close-out. These are good.

review/summary: items were not as fresh as they are in the local grocery
review/text: ... I was excited to find these on Amazon, but i was a bit disappointed.  Unlike the bars I have purchased locally, the bar cannot be extracted from the wrapper intact; they stick to the wrapper as if they had not been kept in a cool dry place.  Except for the annoyance of peeling them off by pieces from the wrapper, they are still quite tasty.

review/summary: Not my kind of flavor
review/text: I've only eaten the KIND bar once, and it was definitely not this flavor but I didn't realize it until I opened it up and tasted it.  I love mango. I love macadamia. But in this bar, together, they are not great.  It's not bad... just not my cup of tea. The mango is a little too artificial and I don't get the macadamia crunch so I would say try another flavor.

review/text: This is not the first time I've purchased KIND bars although it is the first time I have ordered this particular flavor combination.  I just love them.  These bars have a wonderfully nutty flavor and are delightfully delicious to me.  Reminds me of a blend of a nutty granola bar and sweet peanut brittle, only better and much healthier for me.  I will definitely be ordering these again.

review/summary: delicious
review/text: I am gluten-free and dairy-free, so there are not a lot of "on the go" food choices.  Some, like the Lara bars, are really dense and don't resemble real food.  The Kind bars however taste fresh with a nice mix of flavors.  The Cranberry Almond is my favorite, followed closely by the Almond Apricot.  They are resilient enough to be carried around in my purse for "food emergencies".  They get a little flat, but hold up much better than a banana and still taste great.  Good price on Amazon, I pay over $20/box at local stores.

review/summary: Healthy Candy Bar!
review/text: Of all the KIND bars (and I've had them all) this one will hit the spot if you're craving the taste and texture of caramel and nuts. What's nice is that the fat content is relatively low for something that really can qualify as a comfort snack, while the nuts and other unprocessed goodies will give you sustained energy and the important OMGA-3.<br /><br />I've removed all the junk snacks from our home and put in boxes of KIND Bars; this one is the one I have to restock most often. If you're curious, go to your local health food store and pay $2.00 for a single bar; I promise you'll be back here ordering it by the box.

review/summary: Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants
review/text: First got turned onto these bars at Starbucks. Our favorite is the blueberry vanilla & cashew but Amazon does not offer this combo for some reason. So I ordered the  Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants as well as another type, figuring that even if the kids did not like it my husband would take the remainders to work to snack on midday. Well no one likes this flavor. It consists of a lot of the puffed filler grains used in cheap bars, almost like smaller firmer rice crispies. I even had the box in the car to pull out when the kids were starving as a snack but no go and husband doesn't like them. The other kind I ordered was the fruit and nut delight which everyone will eat, but our favorite remains the blueberry vanilla and cashews.
