review/summary: Delicious but not very spicy
review/text: Blue Diamond almonds are by far my favorite for flavor and texture. My only minimal complaint about these is that they are very minimally spicy. I was afraid to go for Habenero in case they were TOO spicy, but given that these are much more mild than Jalepenos I will go for Habanero next order.

review/text: I would just like to say that this company producing roasted almonds is by far the best tasting almonds I have ever had...they are the perfect most tastiest treat on the go whenever you need one and it is really pleasing to have. Its heart food and I like it. This will be a staple snack for me FOREVER :D if anyone in the company reads this comment, I really encourage you to make a WIDE ARRAY of flavors...it would be very interesting and unique. You guys have A LOT of good ones now..but imagine other possibilities. GO AT IT :D!!!

review/summary: Great Spicy Snack - Highly Recommended
review/text: The Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are great tasting, with a strong smoky flavor and a nice jalapeno bite. These have a decent amount of spicy heat to them, but it isn't too overpowering. My wife picked these up for a long road trip and they were the first snack to get finished up.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: only for lime lovers
review/text: I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi.

review/summary: Perfect Snack
review/text: I love these almonds - they are the perfect snack, you don't need to eat a lot to feel satisfied. Also, since they have a lot of flavor, you feel "mouth-satisfied" as well. The wasabi is not too hot (actually I wish it were just a little hotter) and the soy just adds a little bit of saltiness. I recommend these if you like wasabi peas but want something with more nutritional value.

review/summary: Full of flavor
review/text: To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor.

A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, "hey that happens, it's hot out..." But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, "hey these are really salty" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty.

review/text: I love the lime and chili almonds from blue diamond and they are a great snack if you are on a low carb diet. In addition buying the 3-pack of 16oz bags at amazon is a great deal considering that the 6oz can usually costs $3.79 at my grocery store. At first I thought "When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too.

review/text: We discovered these Blue Diamond almond snacks while on vacation a couple of months ago.  We loved them!  Our favorites are the Lime and Chili as well as the Salt and Vinegar.  They are very tasty as well as healthy.  When we got home, we purchased them from Amazon.  We bought the 1.5 ounce snack bags.  They are perfect for lunches or travel snacks.  They also help with portion control!<br />By purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, we are able to get them for $1 or less per bag.  When we purchased them from a convenience store on our vacation we paid $2+ per bag.  It's a great savings to buy them here.

review/summary: A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word "Bold" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a "Bold" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!

review/text: My 8 month old son loves this blend. He's pretty picky, inasmuch as he seems to eschew anything green in favor of fruitier varieties, and he loves this one.<br />I tasted it and thought it would be a great addition to any banana bread, but since we never seem to have any extra that will have to wait for my next life!

review/summary: Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on
review/text: This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own "stand" in order to fill it properly.

review/summary: This filter works PERFECT!
review/text: Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the "old fashion way" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!

review/summary: Ekobrew Washer Hack
review/text: When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16" thick, 5/32" inside diameter, and 3/8" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.

review/summary: Good Product and Excellent Customer Service
review/text: At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.

review/summary: great design
review/text: Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old "My K-cup" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says "some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this "work around" for the time being."  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more "hole down the middle" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!

review/summary: AH-MAZING!!
review/text: WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!

review/summary: Techno-BEST
review/text: My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.

review/summary: Excellent brew, economical too!
review/text: With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!

review/text: I started buying these candies recently because my dentist told me to stop chewing gum. I usually have one driving home from work. The other day I was waiting for my husband to go out to dinner and I was starving so I had three. Big mistake. The third one burnt my tongue. Literally took the skin off. My tongue bled while I slept that night, I woke up with a throat coated with blood. Then it scabbed over and now the scabs are slowly peeling away, so I have dead skin kind of hanging off the middle of my tongue that I am afraid to remove because I don't want to start bleeding again.<br /><br />I've never in my life had this happen with any other candy. I recommend staying away from these!!!!

review/text: These are the best brownies I've ever made or eaten, in a long life as devoted<br />chocophile!

The only problem is that everyone<br />will want the recipe, so you'll have to admit you used a mix ;-)<br />  Tip: try spreading a thin layer (about 1/4 cup) of seedless red raspberry jam between<br />two layers of batter before baking.

review/text: Don't get me wrong, other brownie mixes are fine; you know, the normal brownies that people can add stuff to and they taste great. This mix however is truly a cut above. I'm not clear what makes it so, but I promise you my roofing crew of 60 guys and office staff of 35 think I have some amazing secret because these are just that much more exceptional than the typical vamped up brownie. The flavor is richer, the texture soft, dense, moist yet not too fudgy. Not cake, not fudge, but a clear top notch brownie. And it's a mix. I love doing my own cooking, but whatever these ingredients - which seem typical yet obviously aren't - are, they make it something I just haven't been able to compare to. Now I think, with the price and ease of the mix, why would I? - Leo's wife, Cat

For anyone who is a bit put off by the amount of butter called for in the recipe, what I've found is just as good to do is to put half butter and half vegetable oil. It is still incredibly rich and chocolately and very moist that way. Of course if you want the ultimate experience then of course you'd put all butter in...just be sure to share so you don't go into brownie food coma, people. You've been warned!

review/summary: The Best Brownie Mix on Earth
review/text: I have been eating and baking brownies for forty years and the Dassant Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix makes the best brownies on earth. These brownies are for chocolate lovers that like a very intense dark chocolate flavor. I don't know their secret but this mix produces brownies bursting with flavor in every bite. There is no need for a mixer and the mix will be very dense and thick so you will need to spoon it into your baking pan and level it out with a strong spatula. I love the combination of nuts and chocolate so I usually add walnuts to the mix and they bake up beautifully. You will want to experiment with the cooking time depending on how fudgy or cake-like you want your brownies. I recommend testing the center several times with a toothpick to ensure adequate baking. My house is at 5,000 feet of altitude so I find it takes longer to bake properly than is indicated on the box. These brownies have a fantastic Belgian dark chocolate flavor that just can't be beat.

Don't know what the difference is between this and what you normally get in stores, but it's so worth whatever little extra these might cost.  Haven't done the math, I think these cost a little more, but they don't taste fake, and the ingredients look like just what's necessary.  No chemical soup, if you know what I mean.

review/summary: Seriously?  Fine but not "all that"  I'd sooner eat a DH mix from the store
review/text: You're better off with a $1 Duncan Heinz mix from the store even without adding some chocolate chips (that would be the "truffle" part of these brownies).  I get requests for brownies all the time so when I saw a brownie that was supposed to be amazing, I had to try it out.  Well I made them two weeks ago with family over for the holidays, in a house full of brownie lovers and the pan is still 1/3 full.  That says it all right there.  I can't possibly understand why anyone would give this rave reviews unless they've never made brownies before.  If you really want a good brownie, follow the recipe in the box of bittersweet baker's chocolate.  Not only is the taste nothing to write home about, the package is actually too small for a the listed 8x8.  I used two boxes in my 9x9 and it was just the right size.  That means I paid $8 for one pan of sub par brownies that are still sitting on the kitchen table.  If they had been $1 a piece, I would have given 3 stars because they are still edible.  The brownie is between a dark and milk chocolate and the chocolate chips in it are on the bitter side but not like a good dark chocolate.  The texture is fine but there is a very strong butter taste but not in a good way.  Just go buy baker's chocolate in the orange box.  You will be very happy and save a lot of money.  It takes just about the same amount of time to make them from scratch following the baker's chocolate recipe.

review/text: I ordered this Dassant Truffle Brownie Mix based strictly on the good reviews and we aren't disappointed.  I was a little hesitant to order them because we got burned when we ordered the highly rated Naturally Nora Doubly Fudgy Brownie Mix with Chocolate Chunks.....the brownies were horrible.  We threw away the first batch of Simply Noras and donated the 5 other boxes to the food bank.  Enough about Simply Nora (by the way, in our opinion, her cake mixes suck too, but her frosting mixes are very good).  The Dassant Truffle Brownies are perfect.  Deep chocolate flavor with soft chocolate chunks, moist without tasting greasy, chewy without being gooey...perfect!!  Don't hesitate, there's a Dassant brownie calling your name!

review/summary: Best Brownies Ever
review/text: I was not a brownie lover; they are usually a little too dry for me.  I found Dassant Truffle Brownie Mix at a Tuesday Morning store and got them for my grandson to make.  We made a batch and I was hooked.  Everyone in the house really enjoyed them. By the next week I wanted more and had to drive 30 miles to another Tuesday Morning and I purchased the only three they had left.  I was showing off and sharing my brownie mix with other family and friends but held out on my last box until I looked online and found it on Amaazon.com.  Of course I couldn't order just one so I ordered a pack of 6.  I am not a baker, but I'm asked, "how do you get these to be so moist", or "you must have added an extra egg or something"...no, I just followed the directions and they turn out just as moist and delicious every time.  I'm hooked on Dassant Truffle Brownie Mix.  I also tried the Vanilla Bean cake mix, but I did not care for that particular one.  I must try the Lemon cake mix next.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this product!

review/summary: Can't make them this good at home!!
review/text: I'm very particular about what I feed my dogs. I often make my own "canned/wet" food and treats at home to ensure the quality and safety of the food I'm feeding my dogs. After looking at the ingredients in these biscuits and checking out the price when purchased in the 12 pound box, I realized I could not make biscuits of this quality at home for this price. My dogs really love these biscuits, and I feel good about the quality of this product. I also love that I can divide these biscuits into various sizes, as I have dogs that range from 6 lbs to 130 lbs. Even with 5 dogs this 12 lb box lasts a long time, and it is packaged in 3 heavy zipper bags, so you don't open all 12 lbs at once and they stay fresh. I would recommend these to anyone who cares about what they feed their dogs.

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE These Biscuits
review/text: I have known for a long time that Canidae is a great product, and is not usually sold in stores, so when I saw these biscuits on the Amazon website, I immediately ordered them.  I have two Eskies (miniature American Eskimo Dogs) so I had to have enough for both of them.  This is a big package, so it was definitely enough.  Canidae is so highly rated for both dry and "wet" food that I didn't have to worry about these biscuits containing anything that might not be good for my Girls.<br /><br />It has "Balanced Omega 6 & 3 Fatty Acids" and they are advertised to help control tartar and plaque.  Can't speak to that yet (neither has had a dental for a year) but I do know they love them.  It's a single biscuit that can be snapped into 4 separate pieces.  My Girls, both under 26 pounds, receive 2 half-pieces in the mid-afternoon (that's 1 biscuit broken into 2 pieces) and although one of them trots off with her half-piece as soon as she gets it, the other stands right where she is and crunches down the first half-piece and looks for the next one (just about demands it!).<br /><br />As the package ran low I knew I had to have more for them, and so re-ordered from Amazon.  Another package duly arrived, before the first one ran out, for which I was thankful.  And so were The Girls!

review/text: The Canidae Dog Treats, Lamb and Rice flavor, is the best treats for my dogs.  I have been feeding these treats to my dogs for years, and they are still the best.  They are snap biscuits so I can regulate how much I give them at a time, and guard against weight gain.  I use the Lamb and Rice because one of my dogs has an allegery to chicken and wheat.  I have never had a problem with Canidae Dog Treats, as they are healthy and safe to feed my dogs. I have been feeding the Canidae Dog Treats for well over 20 years and I plan on continuing to do so as long as I can still get the 12 pound box, as I have Big Boys to feed.

review/summary: Canidae Dog Treats
review/text: The Canidae dog treats has been well received by my 1 year old Presa Canarios.  The "snap" configuration of the treat works great since you can break off as much or as little as you want.  I liked the nutritional content of the treats.  So many times the dogs may love the treats but they are not the healthiest for them.  These treats are good for them and they love them.....  I have switched my dogs to the Canidae dog food as well.....

I feed them the same formula Canidae kibble and canned food, so these treats fit in well with their diet - no worry about upset tummies.  They smell kind of nice too, almost like cinnamon.  There is usually a good amount of crumbs at the bottom of the bag which I just sprinkle in their food bowls at dinner time.  I'll continue to buy these for my dogs for as long as they make them.

review/text: I have fed Canidae All Life Stages food for several years to my mixed dog collection, with great results, but for some reason, had not offered the Snap Biscuits.  Finally, I purchased a bag and offered them up.  Well, they must taste treat-like because they gobble them up, and have evidenced no digestive upsets.  Safe and tasty is the verdict.  My test group is aged two years through 10 years, size eight to twenty-five pounds, in generally good health.

review/summary: Great Value, A Little Broken Up
review/text: I was looking for a bulk price bargain on my preferred premium dog biscuit for my two Vizslas & this definitely met that criteria. Canidae's Snap Biscuits always have some bits and pieces in the bottom of the bag, which is understandable since the biscuit is a snap variety. I was afraid the larger quantity might mean more waste & I was right. There were three (3) plastic 4# bags in a large single cardboard box to comprise the 12#, so they must shuffle a bit & in the end the amount of tiny bits & powdery crumbs in the bottom of each bag was a significant amount of waste. Though I'm sure I could use the wasted crumbs in their food bowl, I am very careful to watch their food intake at meal time.<br /><br />I love the nutrition & quality of Canidae's Lamb & Brown Rice Snap Biscuits, but I will likely stick with the single 4# units in the future, which are packed in individual bags.

I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that I thought would love them, however he rates it a 2 star. I was hoping he would be a little more excited about them. They are a larger treat so I break them up into smaller pieces. They also have good things in them.  Most of the time he will eat the treat. Others times he will take it and then drop it in the living room and come back to it later. I will not be getting them again.

The container itself is terribly designed because it has one small whole that the stuff comes out of and sometimes you get a big clump out from it.  They should have used sever smaller wholes like they do with spice bottles so you can shake it more evenly.  Be careful buying this.  I'm going to try some of the other flavors and see if I like any of the other ones.  If I do, I will add more to this review.  As it stands, I'm scare to try any others as this one left a nasty taste in my mouth.

review/summary: Interesting Product!
review/text: Here's one I would never have anticipated. When our 10-month-old son first started going on solid foods, my wife spotted these "cheese puff" things in our local grocery store. Our boy instantly loved them. We now use them in a variety of situations. We have a container in the baby's room and another in his stroller and in the car. They all work in much the same way. Whenever the boy gets cranky, we show him the container and it immediately grabs his attention. He gets real excited when we open it and hold out a crunchy. It almost always stops the whining immediately. Amazing! We've even had him in the grocery store and he got real excited when he spotted them on the shelf. That time we had to buy the puffs just to get through the rest of our shopping.<br /><br />In any case, the Lil' Crunchies resemble Cheese Puffs for adults, but have a much milder flavor. They seem to dissolve in the mouth and have presented no choking difficulties as long as we wait for the first to be gone before giving the boy a second. Now that he's teething, he likes to attempt to chew them up. The Crunchies are available in several flavors, but the boy likes the cheese the best. It's an interesting product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: My favorite gunpowder tea.
review/text: Frontier's organic and fair trade gunpowder is consistently the best of the various brands I have tried. I brew a rounded teaspoon per 12 oz of 170 to 175 fresh water for 5-8 minutes. I find the shorter brewing time recommended on the package does not deliver the depth of flavor that I enjoy. With other brands the flavor seems too flat or too fragrant whereas the Frontier seems to have the perfect balance of grassy, leafy and smokey, and it is robust enough to benefit from longer brewing without getting bitter or too astringent. It can even be re-brewed for a second cup, if you don't mind that it's milder the second time around. A very high quality tea.<br /><br />If you've never had gunpowder tea, each leaf is rolled into a little pellet. When you brew it these pellets open up expanding considerably in size. So tea bags (never the best idea) are especially inappropriate. None the less, to give a new tea a try, or for convenience while traveling, try Numi's organic gunpowder <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ULDY18">Numi Organic Tea Gunpowder Green, Full Leaf Green Tea, 18-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 3)</a> - it's the best of the bagged versions. If you like that, then invest in the Frontier (and make up Tea Sacks <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NE0Q2U">T-Sac - Size 2</a> for traveling, leave plenty of room for expansion). I use the Finum baskets <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D07MCU">Finum Goldton Filters</a> at home, you can buy the smaller ones in pairs perfect for two people with different tastes, and they keep the tea covered while brewing.

review/summary: Inexpensive - drinkable but not delicious
review/text: This is definitely NOT tender young tea leaves!  The tiny pellets open into pieces of what were originally very large tea leaves. The quality is commensurate with the cost.  At least it is organic and that is a plus.<br /><br />I tried brewing this tea in an "extra fine" cup shaped tea infuser and wound up with an awful lot of specs of "dust" that came through the tiny holes and not only looked bad but ruined the taste.  Also the infuser was too small to allow the leaves to fully expand because they do become VERY large.<br /><br />I do not care for the taste of the tea by itself, but find that mixing 1 Tbsp. of these pellets with 2 Tbsp. of ground up yerba mate leaves in the paper filter of my Mr. Coffee and adding cold water in the filter to thoroughly wet the combination before turning on the pot makes 10 to 12 cups of tea that is quite pleasant to drink.<br /><br />That said, the quality surpasses most inexpensive tea bags that I've tried.

review/summary: We weren't impressed with these so-called "premium" cherries ...
review/text: A friend and I spotted these S & W Premium Dark Sweet Cherries in a local store that sells things in odd lots and we decided to buy them.  We both love cherries, but some canned fruits can be quite expensive, as are these, but the price was right.  I did a quick scan of the label, but at the time didn't notice that they contain not only sugar, but also corn syrup.  I might have passed if I'd read a bit closer, especially in light of the fact that the total sugars are 26g.  We each bought several cans and later compared notes.<br /><br />NUTRITION FACTS (basic only):<br /><br />Serving Size 1/2 cup (133g)<br /><br />Serving Per Container abut 3 1/2<br /><br />Calories 140 Calories from Fat 0<br /><br />Total Fat 0g<br />  Saturated Fat 0g<br />  Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol 0mg<br /><br />Sodium 10mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate 34g<br />  Dietary Fiber 1g<br />  Sugars 26g<br /><br />Protein 1g<br /><br />Neither one of us was particularly impressed, she less than I was.  The "sweet" taste obviously came from the added sweeteners, not the cherries themselves.  Perhaps the natural taste of the fruit was overwhelmed by this.  My friend claimed, "It was as if there was a promise of something, but it just wasn't there.  And I've got two cans left."  The cherries were mushy, similar to overcooked prunes, and lacked that subtly tart, sweet taste I usually associate with dark cherries.  Perhaps they would best be served as a topping as suggested on the label.  I'm kind of on middle ground here, but perhaps we got a bad lot so I'll be generous and give them three stars.  I'll pass on them if I see them in the store again ... the premium price and labeling do not mesh what is actually in the can.

review/summary: Arrived broken into little pieces
review/text: Although these are great, as far as taste and lightness are concerned, I will never order them through Amazon again. I placed an order for several cans because they are not available in the area where I recently moved. Upon opening the first can I was thoroughly disappointed to find the contents to be broken into little pieces. Not one of the cans had any piece more than 1 1/2 inch long. Most of the pieces were under 1 inch. Unless you intend to use them as a crumb topping for ice cream or something similar, don't order them thru Amazon.

review/summary: Good Product if  the product is Fresh
review/text: Before you buy ask the expiration date.<br />These are usually very good wafers but the expire date<br />must not be past or within a few weeks.<br /><br />Only buy if fresh.

review/summary: Not as fresh as I had hoped
review/text: I was surprised when I opened the first box of these Piroulines. They were not that CRISP CRUNCHY cookie I had anticipated. They are all wrapped up very well and sealed shut but still act as though they are stale. Sorry.The ones I bought at the grocery store were PERFECT!! so, I don't know what happened. I'll try again when they have more.

review/summary: Fabulous!
review/text: I had only previously tried the hazelnut ones in the Pirouline wafers, but since I adore dark chocolate, I thought I would purchase these dark chocolate filled ones for a new taste treat. They arrived today and I'm just so very pleased with them! Since I've gotten many tins in the store that contained a lot of broken pieces, I worried that these would be likewise crumbled and broken, especially after going through the mail. However, all of the tins were in perfect undented condition ( purchased directly from Amazon.com ) in a "Ready-To-Ship" box, tucked inside another box with plastic bubbles padding it, and the tin I opened to try held absolutely no broken cookie wafers whatever..not a one!<br /><br />The taste is just wonderful, too, and the familiar flakey crisp of the wafer roll is simply perfect, but I was particularly pleased with the really rich semi-solid ( but still soft ) deep dark chocolate filling! They are to die for, just eaten alone, or dunked in your coffee. Since I have 6 tins now, I can easily share one with my sons or a friend, if I can bring myself to part with a tin, that is!

review/text: These wafers are incredibly delicious!  Amazon sells them by the case, and I order them to have for gifts.  Everyone who has tasted them raves about them--even if they say they don't like dark chocolate.

review/summary: Perfect for chocalate & ice cream lovers!
review/text: For years I was able to buy this product at major local grocery stores, then they were gone...off the shelf just like that.  What was I to do, as I could not eat my mint chocolate chip ice cream without Pirhoulines.  I just can't do it.  Finally found them on Amazon.com and ordered a box of 6 cans right away.  I ate the "other brand" during my time going without, and they just don't compare.
