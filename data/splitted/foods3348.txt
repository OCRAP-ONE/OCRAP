review/summary: very good rice
review/text: I buy this from Amazon because our local grocery stores do not carry any form of this rice. Just do not overcook this. I tried it in a rice cooker so it would be done when I came back home. It was way overdone -  just follow directions on the box.

review/summary: The best we have found!
review/text: We had this in the Blue Raspberry and Cherry flavors. Both were excellent, thick, very sweet classic snow cone flavors. By far the best we found (we tried a few brands). I found them at a local big box store, but they sold out very fast. I've been watching for them to stock up for the coming summer and ordered enough (I hope) to last the whole summer.

review/summary: Bloated and Gassy
review/text: I got these drink packages since I don't have time for breakfast in the morning and I'm always in a rush.  These drinks tastes very artifical which I expected.  The fullness that the other reviewers claim is more like bloated-ness.  On an empty stomach these drinks will make you bloated for several hours until you have some real food, and they also make you very gassy all day.  I gave it to other members of my family and they experienced bloated-ness and gas.  I don't know if I will finish my bulk pack from Amazon, but I will not purchase these again.

review/summary: High Protein, Low Sugar, Variety
review/text: I bought this because I was on a high protein, low sugar diet.  A lot of protein powders out there taste really bad, but this is good stuff.  I was going to give it three stars only because I don't care for vanilla, and the box comes with vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry mix.  I don't like vanilla ice cream either, so it's me -- not the product.  The strawberry was OK, but I'm really a chocolate lover so I also bought the canisters of just chocolate. These envelopes are nice though because you can take them along and add them to milk elsewhere.

I am never able to find the variety pack in the grocery stores in my area; they only stock the vanilla and chocolate flavors.  The strawberry flavor is awesome.  I love the ability to change flavors from day to day.<br /><br />Something I noticed right away is the freshness of the product.  There was never any clumping at the bottom of the glass after the mixing of the product with skim milk.  I have experienced some of that when buying off the grocer's shelf.<br /><br />I have been totally satisfied each time I have purchased the Carnation Breakfast through Amazon.  I appreciate your prompt and excellent service.

review/summary: Tasty Capers
review/text: I'm pretty picky when it comes to selecting gourmet foods. I am an unschooled chef having learned to cook from living in Europe and Asia. Capers are part of Mediterranean life and are found in many of Italy's best salads in the finest restaurants, as well as those in Spain, Greece and the Greek islands, This my first experience with Castella Capers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LRIKQS">Capers Non-Pareil, 2lb</a> and I must admit that I am impressed! For the price, the quality and flavor is great. They are especially good with fresh diced Roma tomatoes, fresh basil leaf, flat filets of anchovy, a bit of prociutto and fresh grated asiago cheese. Then sprinkle lightly with balsamic vinegar, cracked pepper to taste. (BTW, My own Recipe) I highly recommend Castella Non-Pareil Capers and I am now a returning customer.

review/summary: Great Taste!  It does work!
review/text: After trying both SK Orange Mango and 5-hour Energy Berry, I must say that SK is soo much better in both taste and the desired result- energy.  I could not stand the smell and taste of the 5-hour Energy drink I tried.  I didn't even want to finish it.  The Street King Orange Mango drink tasted great and it gave me energy all day- even though I only took half of it.  I love that one bottle can give me energy for two whole 8-hour work days.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative to other energy drinks.  And, I think it is pretty cool of 50 Cent to donate a meal for a child in need through the United Nations World Food Programme for every shot purchased.  So in effect, this energy drink gives you the energy to get through the day and the proceeds go to a good cause.  Can't beat that! :)

I also notice that Street King suppressed my appetite. This energy drink makes me feel the same way I do after I have my b12 injections. Not sure if I'll buy it again because I'm not a huge caffeine fan but it is overall good drink.

Starbucks French Roast is one of the most consistent, but even their outrageously high-priced blend has disappointed me of late. The Lavazza is a more mellow blend, which I find drinkable but without that morning "slap in the face" you get from a heartier roast. Does that make sense?

To those who don't know, some "bitterness" in  espressos is a desired quality to some extent.<br />For the money, I find Eight O'clock "100% Columbian" or "Dark Roast" to be quite good for a good cup of espresso, and when I want an Excellent cup, I buy "Italian Roast" coffee from "The Roasterie" in Kansas City, online. These two brands use Higer Quality 100% Arabica beans(I have NO relationship with them except as a customer)and I hardly ever find "quakers" in The Roasterie's coffees (quakers are unripe, underdeveloped beans that usually appear much lighter in color than fully mature coffee beans, and I ALWAYS pick through my whole beans to remove them as the inclusion of even one of these quakers will ALWAYS reduce the quality of the taste of your cup of coffee. More expensive brands of coffee almost always have a significantly reduced number of these quakers.) Lavazza uses a combination of Arabica and Robusta beans. The Robusta beans, in my humble opinion, don't taste as good as Arabica beans, but have, on average, almost twice the caffeine content as Arabica beans, so generally you'll get a much stronger "jolt" if you drink coffees made with Robusta beans. I'll stop my rambling here!<br />Cheers,<br />JL

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Maybe I got a bad lot. These beans were inferior both in appearance and in the espresso brewed from them. I bought a bag in Dec 2009 and the date on the bag was Jan 2011 so I anticipated something reasonably fresh.<br />Upon opening the bag, the beans are below normal in size and a good number of them look like they should have been rejected.<br />The beans also appear to be 'under roasted' or unevenly roasted. The espresso was without the customary sweetness that I so enjoy.<br /><br />I'm back to buying Sumatra or Ethiopian locally roasted.<br /><br />I won't buy these again.

review/text: The price seemed too good to be true. Italian coffee beans for my good espresso machine at a great price. Well, turns out that you get what you pay for: nice packaging but the lowest of the low quality robusta coffee beans (with some arabica, I guess to make it seem "classy". Unfortunately, the smell and flavor give it away immediately. This is very bad coffee, very light in color, off in flavor whether made into espresso or used in drip. Buyer beware. This is cheap quality packaged to mask it's true nature. Don't buy, or prepare to be disappointed.

review/text: Really Bitter Bad Coffee.. I Was Shocked after reading all the great reviews. I ordered based on the reviews.. I dont understand. Did I get a bad batch? I soend over 50.00 for Lavazza Crema e Aroma Coffee Beans, 2.2-Pound Bag and the Lavazza Super Crema Espresso Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Bag. Both bags were sealed. The coffee didnt smell unique or great but I was optimistic. I have a really great espresso machine and have been making my own espresso for over 10 years. I ground it fine same as I always do. I tasted it straight no sweetener , just to get the true taste , very bitter , even after adding splenda , didnt even taste like coffee , just a bitter not too strong coffee taste. Its not even drinkable , no joy. Ill not take reviews at their face value anymore..<br /><br />Im a HUGE AMAZON FAN .. I think amazon has the best return policy , i dont use it much but they really know how to treat their customer. I love the 2-Day air shipping , they really go out of their way to treat every customer like they really want us to come back .. Good Job Amazon :)

Even though I paid over $20 for the bag, I cannot drink it.

review/summary: Not To My Taste
review/text: I knew I was in trouble with this coffee as soon as I opened the bag - beans were medium brown and dry, not that dark, lustrous finish I was looking for.  I have tried several coffees from Amazon searching for a less expensive and more politically correct alternative to Starbuck's French Roast - Jeremiah's Pick Fogbuster, Rocamojo French Roast, Java Trading Co. Seattle Dark Roast.  The Lavazza was by far the worst of these coffees - weak and tasteless.  Rocamojo French Roast came the closest, but not quite there.  Fogbuster wasn't too bad. Java Trading was in last place until I tried the Lavazza. Should have known better than to buy a grocery store-type bean.  Lesson learned...not too expensive a lesson since it was on promotion.

review/summary: Not for household consumption
review/text: Lavazza Super Crema in this configuration made terrible esspresso, terrible french press, terrible moka pot and the worst (outside of Folgers) drip coffee I've ever paid for.  At $30 per bag on average I thought I'd get a deal with the great reputation and taste of Lavazza that I'd experienced in restaurants and coffee shops.  Something must have happened to this shipment to ruin the flavor of this coffee.  I could not get a crema on any of the preparations I used, despite using a burr grinder, spice-grinder etc. I feel as though I tried everything but a $2000 espresso machine and grinder to get a good cup...to no avail.  DO NOT BUY this product.  Stick to store-bought Lavazza or the great reliability (albiet more expensive) Starbucks etc.  If I could get my money back, I would.  I bought three bags with a grand total of $91 invested thinking it would be a great hedge against rising coffee prices.  I reapeat, DO NOT BUY this product.

review/summary: Average
review/text: I expected a lot from these beans after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon. I expected a rich, flavorful espresso bean. These beans appear to be under roasted. They are very light in appearance and don't have any of the customary oil that I find thinly coating other quality coffee beans. I still gave them a try, and the resulting brew did taste better than expected, but was nothing to write home about. They do make a very nice cup of regular coffee if ground using the 'course' setting of my bur grinder. I've decided to just use them for coffee as they make a pleasing cup of moderately strong coffee if you use enough beans. I use approximately twice as many beans as I do with the 100% Kona that is my usual bean to get coffee that tastes substantial. These beans also cost half as much as the Kono beans do, so I guess that's tolerable.<br /><br />I would not recommend these for Espresso. For normal coffee they're fine, but still not in any way remarkable.

review/text: I bought this thinking these were typical expresso beans. They may be most often used to make expresso, but the flavor is unique. I was not familiar with the "Crema" phenomenon. Crema is apparently a flavor. Enjoyed the opportunity to try it, but I would caution those looking for their idea of expresso roast to try a smaller sample. If you don't like "Crema" flavor 2.2 pounds is a lot of trying.

review/summary: *NOT* a Dark Roast!  *NOT* an Espresso Roast.  More like Medium; not flavorful.
review/text: I bought this coffee expecting a dark roast to use in my espresso machine.  I know it's an italian roast but it's much more medium to light than other italian roasts I've had.  The color of the beans is similar to the top of the bag (a medium brown), not oily at all (in fact, they look completely dry).  Whether this is normal or not for this roast, I don't know.<br /><br />All the other italian, and dark/full-bodied roasts I've had have been much darker, bordering on blackish, and have at least some oil on the bean surface.<br /><br />This coffee brews extremely light as an espresso.  I'd say it's nutty and a bit sweet as well. Lacks depth & complexity.  It is smooth, but so is water.  There are no of those darker-roast flavors (smoky, chocolate, toast, etc.) or heartiness.<br /><br />If you're a fan of espresso, french roast, sumatra, and other bold/dark-roasts, this coffee is not for you.  I wish I could return this.

review/text: I have been consistently disappointed in the various Lavazza blends that I have tried.  My last hotel/travel interface with poor quality ground Lavazza pods has resulted in a new addition to my cosmetic bag-- a little Ziplock full of Senseo brand pods, which are decent if not superlative, fairly common in stores, and will accomodate many coffee coffee makers.  I thought the last Lavazza incident was just a bad batch, but it's statistically unlikely that it should keep happening every time.  If you have had better luck with specific blends, bless you, but I think it's not my crappy Karma, but their crummy coffee.  Just my two cents; your mileage may vary.  I use coffee to pry open the eyelids and I need to hit the ground running, so the first cup has to be acceptable.  Life is to short to drink dishwatery coffee.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H6R03M">Senseo Douwe Egberts Coffee Pods, Variety Pack, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Full vs. Medium Roast Espresso Beans
review/text: Espresso beans can be roasted in different ways. Lavazza and Illy represent the best of two different approaches to roasting beans for  Italian espresso. Illy roasts their beans for a longer time, but at a lower temperature, than Lavazza. As a result of its higher roasting temperature the Lavazza is darker, and according to some people more robust, than Illy is.<br /><br />At its best, when properly ground, tamped, and brewed, Lavazza espresso is a bit stronger tasting and also a little bit more bitter than Illy. The Lavazza espresso also has a very pure black color once brewed and when it is done properly it has a hint of licorice in the aftertaste. Personally, though, I prefer the Illy approach which is why I am giving this coffee four rather than five stars. But, even so, I certainly recognize the high quality of Lavazza. In my opinion Lavazza represents the very best of the widely available dark (as opposed to medium like Illy) Italian Espresso roasts.

review/summary: excellent mass-market espresso
review/text: Lavazza makes excellent espresso which for a widely available "mass-market" espresso a huge step up from the American drek like "Starbucks" or anything found found in local supermarkets. A bit more robust & flavorful than the fine but delicate Illy without the burnt  harshness of Starbucks or "Gloria Jeans" or chain beaneries. Espresso should be flavorful but not burnt. It is also worth noting that most specialty shops or restaurant depots in this area will not have this particular Lavazza bean from my experience.<br /><br />Lavazza makes several espresso bean varieties (and some preground) and this particular one is very good and one I've used for years with other Lavazza espresso. Nice crema, smooth taste and you are probably more limited by your espresso machine and barista skills than you are this espresso roast :-)<br /><br />Making 3-5 cups daily of espresso one thing i really like about Lavazza beans are consistent in taste, texture and oily-ness, so you don't have to constantly tweak your grinder. I've tried many different brands & roasts but always seem to come back to Lavazza.<br /><br />The Lavazza beans also stays "fresh" quite long after opening the bag. They taste the same the first day you open the bag as they do a few weeks later. This is very handy if you do not go through a few pounds every few days so you neither have to throw out beans nor go espresso shopping every few days. Who knows how long the Lavazza bags sit in storage, but I have never encountered a stale bag which speaks well for the consistency of this product.<br /><br />I have used local roasters espresso beans and have found they typically do not hold it their flavor long. It seems the immediate "fresh" taste is great but in a few DAYS the local roasters beans fall off quickly in terms of being much drier (need to play with grinder every use) as well as become less flavorful and more bitter over time. Lavazza beans do not suffer from that problem which is another benefit.<br /><br />Lavazza is probably not the beans for tweak-and-geekers who like home-roast (ie. char-broiled beans) and prepare espresso more than they actually like to drink and enjoy it's taste. For real-life espresso drinkers who appreciate fine Italian espresso, Lavazza is a good place to start.

review/summary: Our Daily Grind
review/text: My family thrives on its Lavazza intake.  The Crema e Aroma beans are prepared in our Jura-Capresso S-9, which stays on most of the day.  The flavor is smoother and more full than Illy, which we used before discovering these beans as a result of an Amazon review.  The crema is thick, rich and holds up well to the high pressure of the Capresso.  While some reviews prefer to use another Lavazza for latte or other milk based drinks, we find that a fine grind and the strong setting on the Capresso result in delicious lattes.<br /><br />We now take advantage of the subscription shipping to insure we never run out.  If we get a little ahead in our supply, our daughter is thrilled to take an extra bag off our hands.<br /><br />I would give this product an unqualified 5-star rating except for one flaw we have only noticed recently.  In each bag there appears to be up to a half a dozen green coffee beans.  When accidentally ground with the beans even one of these contaminating little nasty things will ruin an entire pot of coffee or destroy a cup of cappuccino with their awful taste.  As a result, I now sort through the beans before putting them in airtight storage for daily use.<br /><br />Aside from that one flaw, this is a fantastic product at a reasonable price, especially if you take the discounted subscription shipping.

review/summary: Fantastic, awesome taste and texture...
review/text: Great taste! very creamy espresso with a natural sweet aroma, does not need any other cream or sugar to ruin such a rich taste.<br /><br />The reason why your(to the previous reviewer) coffee tasted sour is because you failed to use a decent and suitable home espresso machine.<br /><br /> If you had used the right method and machine it would have been nearly impossible for you not to enjoy the great taste this coffee can offer.<br /><br />These are very high quality espresso beans with a taste so full and rich that you would want to keep going back to it after tasting other coffees.

review/summary: Excellent for espresso, in Italy and America
review/text: I agree with 16+ million Italian households...these are perfect espresso beans. "Crema e Aroma" is a perfectly descriptive name for this coffee. When I fire up the grinder, the aroma is almost enough to make my morning...the aroma from the machine while I'm pulling that first shot of the morning is heavenly...the crema on a double-shot is nearly as thick in the decanter as the coffee! Now that is A LOT of thick, rich crema! The taste is rich and bold with just a hint of an aftertaste.<br /><br />I've tried most of the Lavazza roasts available in America and this is my favorite. The Crema e Aroma roast most reminds me of the little bar just around the corner from the Duomo in Florence and the bar at the bottom of the hill on Via Cavour in Rome.<br /><br />I want to say a few words to the people giving low ratings because the beans aren't "oily" enough or "roasted dark" enough. If you've ever had a real espresso, one made by a licensed barista in Italy, you'd know that espresso beans aren't oily; they're not roasted to the point of midnight darkness. If you see black beans, it means the oils and sugars in the bean have been burnt and you're going to get a bitter cup of coffee no matter how you make it. It is the fine grinding and pressurized steam that make espresso so dark and strong in the cup, not burnt beans! Lavazza coffee is used in the great majority of Italian households and restaurants; I think a lot of the bars (especially in the northern regions) use a different brand, but most of the ones I frequented around Florence and Rome used Lavazza. I can tell you from first-hand experience that when you order an espresso in Italy, the barista doesn't get beans that look black; the beans are a nice light brown with no oily sheen...it is when the barista grinds them to nearly a powder and forces pressurized steam through them that the espresso comes out dark, rich, and wonderful.<br /><br />These beans are the perfect color; medium to dark brown, uniformly roasted. When you grind them, the aroma fills the kitchen. (By the way detractors, that's another way to tell good coffee. If you don't get a big release of aroma when you grind the beans, it means they've been over-roasted and the oils are all gone...perhaps except for that little sheen you want to be on the surface...I'd rather have the oils still in the bean, personally.)<br /><br />It is a real shame that $tarbuck$ and some of the American coffee companies have duped so many people into thinking that Italian-style coffee is supposed to come from burnt, bitter beans.

review/text: The roast is more smooth and mellow than Starbucks. I prefer it to Illy. Produces ample crema. It's a good value. After trying the first bag, I ordered several more. The Lavazza has become my daily espresso bean -- at least until the 8.8 pounds runs out! FWIW I grind with a Rancilio Rocky burr grinder, and my espresso machine is a Rancilio Miss Silvia.

review/summary: The ultimate coffee experience
review/text: We spend a lot of time in Italy and when there, the coffee most often served is Lavazza.  We prefer the Super Crema and have been drinking it when at home for about 10 years. The things I like best about it are:<br /><br />NEVER bitter no matter how strong you make it (and I use a 32 oz press with 1 cup of ground beans)<br />The aroma is simply just heavenly<br />The flavor stays the same, even when you re-heat it.<br /><br />Many of the cruse ship lines are now making Lavazza their house coffee as well.  If you love GOOD coffee, then get yourself a case of this.  I can also highly recommend the Lavazza "espresso" decaf and  "espresso" regular as well as the Lavazza Super Crema y Aroma.  Lavazaa/Lily does not know how to make lousy coffee!

review/summary: Nice Italian blend that's more smooth than bold
review/text: I purchased a bag of Crema e Aroma to compare to all the other Lavazza blends I've tried.  I have enjoyed all of them, but I've been searching for a coffee that's a little bolder to cut throught the milk of my lattes and cappuccinos.  My favorite in this regard has been super crema, as it produces a little stronger espresso than this blend.  Crema e Aroma is good in it's own right, and makes a wonderful espresso shot that's delightfully smooth and non-bitter.  Since I make mostly milk-based drinks, I'm going to look elsewhere for a richer roast.

review/summary: A little bitter, but excellent for the price
review/text: Disclaimer:  I am making this with a french press, not in an espresso machine.<br /><br />I normally drink Starbucks french roast, and am currently finishing some Gevalia whole beans.  In a direct comparison, this Lavazza, when made as coffee, definitely has more crema, aroma, and taste than the Gevalia.  As others have said, though, it's more...well, bitter, than what I'm used to.  I would agree with the other reviewer who noted that this is more bitter than Illy.  It takes a little getting used to.  Also, is it me, or does it seem more 'caffeinated'?  I'm used to the french roast with the slightly less caffeine.  Even though I'm using similar amounts, and making it the same way, this seems to have more of a caffeine effect.  For the sale price, it was great, since it's less than my Starbucks beans, but the 'bitterness' is there (sorry, I know some people object to the term, but I don't know of any other way to describe it.), and I don't know that I would pay full Amazon price for this.  It's good, but not quite for my novice palate.

review/text: This is not the first time I purchased this brand. I purchased the SuperCreame before. For my taste Buds they are both Bitter. The creame looks good but breaks down fast. I am not perfect and I have tried different grines from my grinder. I think I have the right gind but this coffee is just bitter. I am open to suggestions. My Cousins has a very old auto esspresso maker and it makes a great esspresso with lavazza but it is still bitter.... Help me out here??? Thanks.<br /><br />UPDATE: Maybe it is an acquired taste???? Still BITTER!!! The bag says "Italy's Favorite Coffee" Well you know what comes to my mind?? I guess if we lived in Italy and wanted American coffee the Can of Maxwell House Coffee would say "America's Favorite Coffee" We know that is not true????? Woke up this morning and turned on the machine, ground my coffee and Bam!!!! Bitter. I can not get used to it.. I try to drown the flavor with sugar. I even went back to using Half/Half!!!! I will not buy this again. At Stop and Shop I buy whole coffee beans from PEET'S Coffee. That is the best I have found.  Lavazza should say " Just another reason to stay in bed in the morning"

review/summary: Daily Coffee
review/text: Works great in our Saeco Go!  Have ordered this from Amazon for over a year now and have used it daily without any problems.  The crema is wonderful and the aroma is very pleasant.  It may not be "GREAT" at any one thing, but it's really good at everything.  I like a good all around bean that I can use for shots or coffees by simply dialing the water flow up or down.<br /><br />I do think it has it's own unique flavor, which may put some people off.  It's not unpleasant to me, it's just the right amount of "strong", and it's real easy to use in my cheap Super Automatic.<br /><br />We have also used the Lavazza Super Crema and Starbucks Espresso.  None of them were bad - the SB Espresso didn't make very good coffee, but it made good espresso.  I prefer a lot of crema in my coffee, and this fits the bill nicely.  As for the Lavazza Super Crema, it had the same amount of Crema and was very similar in flavor.

review/text: My experiences had been drip coffee - a lot of it, over the years.  I recently bought an espresso machine, and started experimenting with different coffees.<br /><br />Some stuff I didn't like all that much - Illy dark and medium roast was kind of flat for me, sort of bland.  Peet's Italian stuff was chocolately, but muddy/muddled in flavors.<br /><br />This, though, Crema e Aroma, absolutely lives up to it's name.  Lots of flavor starting with the aroma when you open the bag and grind: mouth-filling, round, with that coffee taste I adore.  It's got a fair amount of persistence, that taste, which may not be great for some folks, but I really like it.<br /><br />I get nice crema from this, pressure PF or plain PF (it's a small retail DeLonghi BAR-32, but I have a non-pressure filter for it).  The shot starts dark, blonding only a little, and the crema is a beautiful camel tan/brown that fills the room with the smell of great coffee.<br /><br />It's got some caffeine, for sure, I get a pretty strong buzz after a double.<br /><br />I love this coffee!

review/text: I tried Crema e Aroma and compared it with the more expensive Lavazza Super Crema.  I liked the Crema e Aroma better, because of its more pronounced and pleasant flavor.  The Super Crema tasted generic to me.  In addition to one's own subjective taste preferences, the final outcome depends on one's espresso machine, grinder, and coffee amount per shot.  My machine is a DeLonghi Magnifica with a built-in grinder, set to max. coffee and almost minimum water per shot.  I am sure that there a better coffees out there but Crema e Aroma is a compelling value.

review/summary: great coffee
review/text: I bought this to try in my espresso machine at my restaurant. While the espresso i was using did fine for the milky cappucino and latte drinks, this coffee was noticably superior in my fav drink, a shot of espresso, and a 1/2 $ 1/2 creamer.  So if you do shots, or are not happy with your current brand, i'd recommend giving this one a shot.. Wait til they rn a special though (which seems to be often) for a nice savings.

review/text: I really enjoy this expresso coffee, it is always smooth, never bitter<br />or over roasted to taste burned. It makes a wonderful cappucino, with<br />a frothy head, it has a nice frothy head in just a plain cup of espresso.<br />I highly recommend it and have ordered it a few times. It is also a great<br />price.

review/summary: great whole bean coffee for my automatic espresso machine
review/text: This is the fourth bag I've bought for my La Pavoni automatic machine. I've tried many brands but I keep returning to this. It seems to work best with my burr grinder and tastes like authentic Italian espresso. Nice crema. Other brands of "espresso" coffee beans are too oily and clog up in the hopper above the grinder and the coffee taste burnt.
