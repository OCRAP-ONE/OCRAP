review/text: I purchased these because pistachios where I live (SoCal) are overpriced. They are fresh and roasted perfectly. These aren't at all too salty or difficult to open. Even the ones with the smallest opening are easy to open with my nails. I will be buying these as often as I run out.

review/text: We eat a lot of pistachios and these are the best. Used to buy Wonderful (and other brands) but then found they are not USA, too many are not cracked and they are smallish.<br />Keenan's, on the other hand, are large, open, perfectly salted with sea salt and grown in the USA. The price is not much different for the best. My family will only be buying Keenan's from now on.

review/summary: Addicted
review/text: This is my heroin, my nicotine! I buy two of these jars every 3-4 weeks. This is a great value for 56 ounces of pistachios; that's 3.5 pounds, they are for the most part fresh and flavorful. The salt level is just about right, not too salty and tasty. I would say that 90-95% of them are good, the others are unopened and after opening most times empty so not worth almost breaking your teeth. (Empty also means almost weightless so you didn't pay for them...)<br /><br />A little tip, the best time to order them is just after Amazon ran out of stock, and replenished, very fresh then! Keep them in your cart to see this happening. This just happened end of NOV2011!

review/text: I'm a pistachio nut (very punny, haha).  I've tried virtually even brand of pistachio out there.  I've even had my own pistachio taste tests where I try three or four different types/brands at a time.  Keenan Farms is definitely one of my favorites.  They have a great flavor and a low unopened nut rate.  Far far better than Planters and noticeably better than Wonderful pistachios.  However, perhaps on par with nuts.com.

Unfortunately I will not be purchasing these again. Too bad they are priced so much higher.

What I love about all of Dilmahs teas is that you first taste the tea and then the flavor used.  I do also like that it is all natural flavoring.  Dilmah Carmel makes you feel like you have just had a nice treat with none of the guilt.  I will make sure my cabinet is stocked with this one.

review/summary: Swimming in Bergamot Perfume
review/text: ***<br />This Decaffeinated Earl Grey Tea from Stash is plain, and definitely not subtle because of a strong bergamot component---way too strong! If you really, really love bergamot you may like it, but I much prefer a more subtle and more complex tea. It tastes like perfumed black tea; I could hardly drink it. I am an Earl Grey fan, but just couldn't stomach this tea.<br /><br />On the plus side, it is naturally decaffeinated, which I appreciate. Also, it seems like the quality of the black tea is very good, though, because even with a longer brewing time, the tea did not become bitter...so, if you can stand being hit over the head with the bergamot flavor, you might enjoy it.<br /><br />Only recommended for those who want a strongly perfumed bergamot Decaf Earl Grey.<br />***

But there might be a slight texture change, I do not reccomend baking biscuits with this mix, they come out flat and a bit sweet tasting (strange enough) However Cinnamon Rolls and Pancakes taste very good with this mix, its not the orginal but its close and a healthier choice.

review/text: I spend a period of time living, working and studying in Japan and now get Japanese food cravings.  I have always loved mochi and was looking for a place to soothe my cravings.<br /><br />But, I could barely choke these mochi down.  The rice cake part of the mochi is supposes to be soft and tender.  The ones in my package were extremely chewy and hard on the outside(especially the red/pink mochi).  The sweet bean on the inside was fine but the outside texture took away all my enjoyment.  I threw my package away after trying to eat two mochi (all the rest felt lumpy and hard too!).  What a waste of good money!<br /><br />It would be interesting though to know the packaging date and how long a package stays fresh.  The consistancy of mine seemed like it was past the "fresh" date.  That's sad because I have picked up packaged mochi in Asian markets in the U.S. that has been relatively fresh.  It can be done.

review/text: For a ball of rice paste full of bean mush, it's certainly much tastier than you'd think....  the red bean paste (which is the traditional filling for many japanese snacks) is very sweet and thick, almost like preserves... except, it's bean paste, so it has a slightly gritty texture that takes some getting used to.  they are pretty rich, so I don't think i'll be able to more than one in a sitting...

review/text: This is very good mochi - tastes exactly the way it should, in the best meaning of that! I am going to order one more pack.<br />Mochi is not as terribly sweet as cupcakes and other sweets we used to have, it has amazing texture and a gentle, soft taste. A very healthy choice for sweets! Love it.

review/summary: First time mochi eater
review/text: This was the first time I have eaten mochi and, at first, I didn't think much of it due to the fact American sweets are much richer, but I have to say that after eating two or three of them I got used to the flavour and came to love the texture! I have already ordered another batch because I finished mine! I am definately a mochi fan now. ^_^

This would probably be good with tea, a snack alone to me wasnt the best thing...<br />even if this was an okay experience this is still a very good Japanese candy that will stay on my mind.

review/text: A delicious treat that is a must if you are a lover of mochi.  The taste is similar to cotton candy, without being too sweet.  In terms of texture the outside is jelly-like while the inside has a more pasty texture.  A truely unique and tasty dessert.

review/summary: Great dog treats
review/text: My dog has been enjoying the Bench and Field Canine treats for many years. Until recently they were available nationwide at a popular grocery discounter. Now, the only economical way to get these, at least on the East Coast, is from Amazon.com. I expect Amazon will be getting lots of orders for them now. The treats are very healthy and fit nicely into the rubber kong toys to give a dog lots of chewing for clean, strong teeth and exercise. My dog also eats the Bench and Field dogwood and is healthy and energetic at 11 years old.

However they went on to say that I could purchase it at Amazon.  I quickly went there and have been able to purchase it ever since.  This is the best dog treats I have been able to find for my 3 dogs.  I would do not nor would I want to give them anything other that these treats which are natural and healthy for them.  Not full of all kinds of nonsense they do not need.  I only hope that I can always find them on Amazon.  They sure love their treats..

review/text: If I had noticed there was a date on these dog treats before I purchased them I would have checked it. Ater feeding my dog almost expired and now expired treats I wasn't happy.  You  can't sell 6 bags of treats with an expiration date on in this case one week.  When I looked back on bags I bought previously, (Jan 2012)  they had an expiration date of 5/2011.  Of course I only had two left so I dumped them, but I was feeding my pet dog treats I purchase in Jan. 2012 that expired in May 2011. Fool me once shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Will not order these treats through Amazon again, unless I am guaranteed free return shipping if the treat expiration if not at least 3 mths ahead of the date of purchase.  Thank you for listening

review/summary: European Acacia Honey: Ethereal!
review/text: Heaven on earth. Nectar of the Gods. Acacia honey is incredibly thick, drizzles smoothly & consistently, clear, & delicate flavoured.  Apparently it has natural (bee made) properties which make it more resistant to spoilage or crystallization, even as compared to other types of honeys. (Honey is a natural preservative, possessing natural anti-microbial properties, even used for wound care in some instances).<br /><br />For culinary enjoyment, bake it into breads & cakes, they will remain fresh & moist longer (honey is a natural humectant).  Spread it on fresh baked French bread & you will experience one of life's finer things- Go ahead, see how the other half lives! Also sooo delicious on desert cheese- even just plain ricotta- or drizzled on fruit, mixed into iced tea (in each/any case, a little goes a long way).  Always remember, honey is unsafe & must not be fed to infants under 1 year old, as their digestive & immune systems is/are not yet fully developed and therefore are susceptable to a natural bacteria inherant in honey, which can cause severe illness or even death.<br /><br />Acacia honey is truely an exquisite experience. It can be tough to get in the US (being primarily a European agricultural product), but if you can find it, it's so delicious that it seems underpriced at the $10 or so per jar you may pay for it- Enjoy!

White wine is a little harder to degas, so after stirring...stirring..you get the picture...I quit with still bubbles in it. I think that made the finished product a little harsher, but after 3 months it greatly improved. I have some set aside for Christmas Gifts so should be perfect by then. I really recommend these kits, especially if your equipment is smaller, like mine. This was my first kit, then I did V. Italiano Merlot.....really got that degassing thing down..and it turned out Great!! Too dry for me, but I added 2 Tbls wine conditioner per bottle....perfect...sweeter in the front of the mouth....dryer in the back!! ha ha  I just ordered the V.

I have purchased a couple of other brands that are purified after simply being taken from the tap; but because Poland Springs bottled water actually comes from a spring I am impressed.<br /><br />The water tastes great and it is extremely refreshing to drink very cold on a hot summer's day. The water can be served cold or at room temperature, whichever you please.<br /><br />Have questions? No problem. The company lists both a toll-free telephone number and a website address for people to contact them. Good PR!<br /><br />Poland Springs bottled water is good for you. It helps to keep your system cleansed; and I prefer Poland Springs bottled water to other brands because it comes from a spring before they process it and put it in bottles for us to drink.<br /><br />Great job, Poland Springs!

review/text: I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!

review/text: I have been searching for an all natural doggie treat for my west highland white terrier for a while, she has severe allergies to most dog treats because of all of the flour , wheat and artificial preservatives in them. So when I found these at my local pet store I thought I would give them a try, the ingrediants are all natural! Happy day! Well let me just say she absoulutly LOVES THEM! I order 2 bags at a time and they are good for her as well! She knows when I say its treat time she runs to where I keep them! Thanks so much for a great product!

review/summary: Our Dogs Like These
review/text: Our dogs like crunchy chews, but they can't be too hard. We made that mistake with poor Piper who lost a few teeth biting on chews that were way too hard for her petite mouth. Our canine dentist advised that we not give our dogs any chews that we couldn't bend with our hands. These Beefeaters pass the test.<br /><br />Our dogs tell us they like the taste and crunch of these chews. We also notice that these chews leave no stains behind and no crumbs either.<br /><br />I had to reduce the rating my one star because these Beefeaters are a product of China. I find this disconcerting, but we've never had any negative reactions in our dogs from the Beefeaters.<br /><br />Ingredients: rawhide, rice flour, red #40, chicken flavor<br /><br />Visiting the Beefeaters web page and reading about the quality control measures taken through the manufacuring process reassures me somewhat.

review/text: Caffe Verona has been our coffee of choice for years, with a smooth great taste and no bitter aftertaste or acidy feeling. At the current price (lower than in a previous review) it is a good deal for the three pack, lower than any store price. Yay Amazon. Now if you would just carry our seasonal favorite, Starbucks Brazilian Ipanema Bourbon.

review/summary: Changed the recipe
review/text: When I and Verona, it tasted different than before. I guess Starbucks changed the recipe? It's okay - I think I'll go with breakfast blend next time. The value though is great - 3 bags! And you can return each bag for a tall coffee. So really you are purchasing 3 premium whole bean coffee, and 3 tall coffees at starbucks. How can you go wrong? And your still getting it cheaper than at Target, Walmart, or Starbucks itself.

review/summary: Poor quality beans
review/text: I was looking forward to trying this bold coffee flavor which was supposed to have a sweet flavor.  However, although package arrived earlier than promised, the beans were old (dull, not glossy) without evidence of oil on them (which fresher beans would have).  Lacked powerful smell (if fresh, would have been strong when opened).  Consequently, this coffee tasted poor/watery after beans were ground and dripped.

review/summary: Excellent semi-bold taste
review/text: I originally ordered this when it was $7+ for one 12 oz. bag and I needed an item to bring me up to $25 for free shipping. Today I'm ordering it for the the third time, and in the the 3 bag amount and not as a filler!<br /><br />I like medium-bold coffee most of the time and for me that's Eight O'Clock's Columbian. Sometimes I want it really bold and Cameron's Intense French does the trick. But sometimes I want something in between and Starbuck's Caffe Verona is just that, as well as wonderfully flavorful without being bitter.

I think our "famous" coffee is half the reason why they show up every week!  Buying in bulk helps to make it economical and it arrived fresh and well-sealed.

review/summary: Good deal for those hardcore caffeine-iacs
review/text: First of the biggest feature after price was shipping time, and boy were they fast. I placed my order and in three days it was at my door with just the free Amazon shipping.  The coffee itself is a full bodied, robust coffee perfect for drip, espresso, and my french press.  I prefer the whole bean to control the grind but they do have the option of pre-ground, which is best for just drip.  It may be too dark for some people but those of us who work graveyard shift know the best coffee is when you have to chew it.  Finally the price.  You get three bags of the standard sized Starbucks, which compared to my local grocer and the local Starbucks works out to be close to a buy two, get the third bag free.

review/text: I served Starbucks Verona coffee to houseguests in June. They commented that the coffee was<br />unusually good and asked what it was. This family grinds coffee beans daily for the freshest<br />brew possible, and they are very discerning. I then sent 3 backs of Verona to the family as<br />a gift. The product arrived a day early and I am assured it is just as fresh and good as if they<br />had purchased it at a Starbucks store.

It can be a little "muddy", but I add milk and sugar to mine anyway.  This is a good every day coffee, after dinner coffee, or whatever you like.  It also makes a great iced coffee drink.

review/summary: Change in blend?
review/text: I am a long time lover of Caffe Verona whole beans.  However, I bought a bag two days ago and noticed that the bag design is new, and in addition the most prominent word on the front of the bag reads "DARK", unlike the prior design with the word "BOLD" being less prominent.  This would not be worthy of comment if the product tasted the same as Caffe Verona Bold.  After grinding for three mornings I am convinced that the formula or process has been changed.  If this one bag is not an anomaly, Caffe Verona is no longer my favorite--same for other family members who are also discerning coffee lovers.

review/text: I can certainly distinguish difference in different branded coffee beans, but all Starbucks coffee taste same to me, regardless of specific recipes.  This is just marketing gimmicks by Starbucks, conceivably to charge more with labels.<br />My price is of $5.33/oz justify the order from Amazon instead of buying from local warehouse where I usually source my coffee beans, currently selling at 15-20% higher than this price.  As long as Amazon consistently beats the Costco price, I'll be glad to switch to Amazon.  For whole bean coffee, I only use high-end Saeco machine for years.
