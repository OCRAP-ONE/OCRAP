review/summary: Great Tasting popcorn!  Sooo much better than microwave stuff!
review/text: It seems all of our friends and family are so used to microwave popcorn, that when we pop this, they start to ask lots of questions.  One of my friends "had" to go out and buy a larger machine than mine!  (It seems he always has to 1-up me)  In any case, this is the closest stuff to movie theater popcorn you can get, however I like it a bit better than the movie theater popcorn served here.  The packs are perfect for the size of machine we have, I just wish I had a larger machine...  I have no complaints about this product.  I have a couple about my machine, but we will leave that to another review!

review/text: This is the best tasting popcorn we've found for our stand popcorn popper.  We've tried a few others and this tastes the closest to movie theater type.  It pops well and tastes wonderful!  Works well on the stove top, in the counter stir-type popper and also in the popcorn cart type popper.  Highly recommend!  Glad we found it, plus the price is great!

review/summary: Great popcorn! Just like the movies!
review/text: I have been searching to find that perfect movie theater popcorn that I can make at home; well, I found it! I recently purchased a Stir Crazy popper and this popcorn works great with it. The seasoning and oil combines to make a perfect and delicious batch every time. At first I was concerned about buying such a large quantity of popcorn without knowing how it would taste, but I can already tell that I'll be going through this box fast. A+ recommended!

review/summary: All-N-One, Not bad
review/text: We purchased a large table top popcorn machine with an 8oz. kettle. It is a little difficult to squeeze the oil portion into the large kettle.  The flavor of the popcorn is quite good.  The packages are easy to store.  Overall my rating was 3 stars because of the difficulty with the solidified oil. We have a family of 5 and use 2 packages to satisfy all of us.  One package can easily feed 3-4 people.

review/summary: Too Salty
review/text: Way too much salt in this pack.  Don't get me wrong, I like me some salty popcorn, but this is over the top.  However, you can solve the issue by cutting a hole in the bottom of the popcorn side and pour 3/4 of the salt out.  Once we discovered this trick, great tasting popcorn was the result.

review/summary: Yes, this is the stuff you're looking for.
review/text: These little packets have everything you need to make commercial-quality popcorn.  Two pouches in each packet:  one with popcorn and flavored salt (flavacol, or something just like it), and one with that bright orange oil (solid at room temperature).  The yellow color, the flavor and the salt all find their way into the popcorn.  If you like the "butter" stuff they squirt on at the theater, that's a separate purchase.  You might want to consult your doctor.<br /><br />The 2.5 oz. packets are made for the baby-sized commercial-style machines, and they produce a smallish batch, about enough for one person.  I got one of these for Christmas, and now I wish I got a bigger model, at least a 4-oz. popper.  The little tub loses too many kernels during popping.  Plus, the small size makes it tough to clean and load the tub.  Anyway, the popcorn is great.  If you are an occasional popcorn eater, these packets are incredibly handy.  If you make a few batches a week, though, you might want to invest in a big tub of the oil and a box of flavacol, which should save money in the long run.

review/summary: Real Deal Theater style... as easy as microwave popcorn
review/text: Using this popcorn in my new popcorn machine that I ordered for the office... coworkers love it.  Comes in premeasured bags with the REAL DEAL theater ingredients like coconut oil and butter flavored salt.  Just cut it open and pour it in - probably works best with a theater style popcorn maker - plent of those available for less than $150.  If you have a home theater, get a popcorn maker (i have the paramount 8oz - works perfect), then get this popcorn.  I will be ordering again.  I accidentally bought the 4oz instead of 8oz, but i just use two packets.  8oz is a better deal it seems for about $7 more.

review/summary: Great popcorn
review/text: I use the whirly popper. I bought the 4 oz package because the 5.5 oz packages from the competitors were always too much popcorn for one person. To my surprise, the 4 oz package from great northern popped MORE popcorn than their competitors and overflowed my popper!  If you only want popcorn for one, order the 2.5 oz size. The popcorn is delicious and almost every kernel popped. Tastes just like the movie theater popcorn. I paid less than $20 for 24 packs which is a bargain compared to what I would pay in the store for a box of 5.

review/summary: Great Popcorn!
review/text: After being VERY disappointed with the performance of a Maxi-Matic 4oz popcorn machine with Orville Reddenbacher's Original Gourmet Popping Corn and canola oil, I decided to order a prepackaged mix before giving the machine away.<br /><br />It took a few weeks for the Great Northern mix to arrive, most likely due to the holidays.  It was well worth the wait.  The first batch tasted just like movie popcorn!  The texture, color, saltiness and flavor were just what I was hoping for.  The popcorn was also hot when it left the kettle, not like the Reddenbacher popcorn.<br /><br />This is not the healthiest choice for popcorn, but it will satisfy my cravings for the real thing on an occasional basis.

I have a 4-quart Whirley Pop stove top popper and the four ounce size size was just right.  It filled completely up and all of it popped.  And I noticed that there was very few husks.  Obviously, there's popcorn, and then there's popcorn!  Although some will probably complain because you have to cut the top off the package and squeeze to get the semi-solidified coconut oil out, it was no problem for me.  And certainly worth it!

review/text: My family loves popcorn; the portioned packages work well.  the only suggestion that I would have is to cut the popcorn and seasoning part out first, place them in a measuring cup.  this will make it easier to pour in the pan for popping.  I spilled a significant amount of the seasoning and popcorn at first; and the fact that it's stored in plastic makes it not such a wise decision to place the plastic next to the hot pan.  of course put the butter in first, then add the popcorn and seasoning; less mess.<br /><br />just about every kernel pops.  very tasty!!!

The salt in the pouch gave the popcorn the perfect amount of saltiness for my tastes, but it may be a bit salty for some.<br /><br />I'll probably stick with the 6oz version even when I reorder, as it's only a $2 difference (as of 08/13/09).

review/summary: Captures that movie theater taste, but far from perfect
review/text: I purchased this product for use with my new Maxi-Matic popcorn machine, with the goal of producing that movie-theater taste that none of my previous popping efforts had replicated. These portion packs succeed in that the flavor is spot-on. They might even be better than what you'd get in a theater because the flavor is so fresh when just popped.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor alone doesn't make this a great purchase. As others have mentioned, the texture of the popped corn varies widely. Of four pre-portioned packages that we've popped so far, three produced stale, chewy popcorn. When we tried the fourth batch using the packaged butter salt and coconut oil with an equivalent amount of another brand's popcorn that we had on hand, it was much more tender.<br /><br />Also, if the packs are poured directly into the kettle as intended, the resulting popcorn is almost inedibly salty. Much more palatable results were produced using about half of the packaged amount. But by the time you're customizing the pour, the 'convenience' factor of these packages is shot. Not that they're very convenient, anyway - the 4 oz. portion was very difficult to transfer into our 4 oz. kettle. The bag is very big compared to the working space inside the heated kettle elements, and it's almost impossible to make popcorn without oil, salt, and kernels falling all over the place or dripping all over the bag.<br /><br />Considering the portion issues and difficulty of use, in the future I'll be buying the three components separately. I'd stick with this company's coconut oil and butter salt, but would likely get different corn.

Initially, I ordered this popcorn because of it's great price and relevance to what I needed, and ended up really enjoying it for the taste! The butter's consistency is hard when I received it in the mail, though it melts right up in the popper and YUM! We had great popcorn.....

review/text: This popcorn is da bomb!  Very yummy, even when cold and over 24 hours old.  (I know kind of gross)  I bought the 2.5 ounce so I could pop smaller portions in my 4 ounce popcorn machine.  Works like a champ.  The oil is coconut oil, same oil they use in theaters nationwide.  It is a solid and is a little difficult to get out and into the kettle while you try not to spill your corn and salt mixture.  I let the kettle heat up for about 3-5 minutes, then empty the oil in the kettle.  Immediate afterwords I pour in the popcorn salt mixture and less than 4 minutes BAM you are at the movies for about 1/56 of the price.  Healthy economical snack for the whole family.  We LOVE our Great Northern popper and popcorn from Discount Tommy!!!

review/text: I have a small theater style popcorn maker in my home-theater room. This popcorn is well measured and tastes great. All that being said, I am guessing it is not very healthy. We do not live on this product. What could taste so good and be healthy anyway. My only complaint is that the popping is so rigorous that I do get quite a few unpopped kernals that fly from the kettle. But with the old-maid holes in the floor, its a small price to pay for such a great product.

review/text: The 2.5 oz. size bags of Great Northern Popcorn comes with oil on one side of bag and the popcorn and salt on the other side. This way you can add the oil to the popper and warm it up ( usually takes around 3 minutes.) Add the popcorn and salt and in just a few minutes you are ready to enjoy. Now I did found some old maids, but i had tried other popcorns and also found it true with these too. This has a good taste and just the right amount of salt. I feel that this is a good buy for the money. This work good with the use of the 2.5 oz table top retro style popcorn popper.

All the Ingredients are there in a small package...popcorn, salt, butter, oil. I use it with a Popcorn Machine that my daughter got for Christmas. She can easily make great popcorn for her friends, parties,etc without having to measure the amount of oil,salt,popcorn. If you own a Popcorn Maker I would strongly suggest this product. No need of having to find the right popcorn oil, popcorn butter or popcorn salt because it is mixed together in the package along with the popcorn. Amazon sells this cheap as well. Only $0.71 for each package.

review/summary: Good price for very good popcorn portions
review/text: We have one of the smaller 4 foot Nostalgia popcorn kettle poppers and the kettle doesn't seem too big and finding popcorn portions for it is not as easy as I had thought. Amazon to the rescue! -- I found these smaller portion packets (2.5 oz) and these packets seem to do the trick.  The popcorn was very good - just the right amount of salt and butter flavor.  No fault of the popcorn itself but rather the popcorn popper, I concluded that 2.5oz of popcorn is not nearly enough popcorn for 2 or 3 people, especially when 6-7 percnt of the kernels never pop (again blaming the machine) and I usually end up having to make two - 2.5 oz servings for 3 people. Thats when the novelty of making concession style popcorn can get pricey.<br /><br />With free shipping this is one of the best deals around. I would recommend it to others and suggest that they try one box and determine if the taste is satisfying to their palete, if its not for you, you can always send me the unused packs and switch to microwave popcorn at a fraction of the cost.

review/text: This popcorn actually tastes like the theater popcorn. All the kernals pop up and it makes ALOT of popcorn. You don't need to add anything extra to it after it's popped to make it flavorful because it is so good on it's own. Just be aware that the oil pack is hard. It's almost like stick butter but it quickly melts in the popper. I just mention that because at first, I thought there was something wrong with it. Makes watching movies at home very enjoyable! You can store the popcorn if you can't eat it all and it even tastes good a little stale. Very pleased with this purchase!

review/text: This is great tasting movie theater popcorn that can be enjoyed in your popcorn machine for days after being popped. It is good to have a convienent 4oz package to easily make up great tasting batches of popcorn when wanted. We have a Nostalgia Electric 4oz Movie Time Popcorn Cart in our home theater room and this makes it perform like a professional model producing real movie theater popcorn. You can even add a tiny bit of Orville Redenbacher's Buttery Flavor Popping and Topping oil to get extra butter flavor, like when adding butter topping at the movies. We were concerned about possible lingering popcorn smell in our theater room, but this has not been an issue at all. Clean up is a bit more involved than after using just regular oil and popcorn (more oil and seasoning thrown around), but it is not too bad and worth the effort. This is a great product for 4oz machines.

review/summary: Not very impressed at all...
review/text: I ordered the Little Bambino popcorn popper along with a 24ct. box of this popcorn.  All the items arrived right before Christmas (love Amazon Prime!) as promised.  The popcorn popper itself was a breeze to set up.  I got this for my girlfriend as she LOVES popcorn.  The reason for the low review?  The popcorn is HORRIBLE!  It was tough and chewy.  We ended up with just as many kernels as we did with popped popcorn.  I tried to excuse this since it was the first time using the machine, but 4 bags later and the popcorn is still just as tough and chewy as the first batch.  And did I mention that the popcorn was way too salty but that was more than like the result of so much of it not popping.<br /><br />Once you hear the popcorn popper stop popping popcorn, your supposed to turn off the popper as it will burn what's left in the popper because it's all jammed with popcorn. The oil has to go in first so the popcorn doesn't get burned when you drop it in the popper.  I tried to alter the steps in different ways hoping the popcorn would come out better but it just didn't work out for us.<br /><br />Gonna give good 'ol Mr. Redenbacher a shot next.  Now I just need to figure out how to cancel my 'popcorn subscription'.

review/summary: Good & Bad
review/text: The good:<br /> - Good taste;<br /> - Pops up plump;<br /> - Convenient.<br /><br />The bad:<br /> - Lots of unpopped kernels (far more than any other brand I've used). You get plenty of popped corn, but it seems a waste and could lead you to question freshness or quality of the corn;<br /> - Uses the coal tar dyes Yellow #5 and #6 which have been implicated in various health issues and are listed as Group I carcinogens by the IARC.<br /> - The generic term "natural and artificial color" is used rather than listing actual flavor contents.<br /> - No "best by" or expiration date on the package<br /><br />For me the bad will prevent me from ordering more of this otherwise good popcorn. I don't need questionable additives just to make my popcorn yellow, and it leaves a colorful gross residue in the pan after popping. And for flavor, if the popcorn itself, along with whatever I want to add on my own, can't carry the day, I will find a product that can stand on its own.<br /><br />Other:  You only need 4 oz, or half this bag, to completely fill a standard Whirley-Pop so you can cut back as needed. Very salty for my taste, so you may want to start with much less than the salt offered and then salt to taste till you find the amount that works for you.

Food is not allowed to be returned to Amazon so I am stuck with over 20 bags of corn kernels that are inedible. Followed the directions exactly and popped the corn in my new popper, making sure not to over cook. Popcorn came out stale tasting with card board consistency. It was dry and just awful.

review/summary: Varying Freshness Ruins What Could Be Great Popcorn
review/text: My wife and I take movies and popcorn very seriously. Every Friday and Saturday night, after the kids are in bed, we turn out the lights, pop in a blu-ray, and sit down to a movie with popcorn and soda. For about a year or so we had been buying fresh popcorn locally, but the shop had closed down and we searched for a replacement on Amazon. We knew we wouldn't find popcorn as fresh, but we were mostly concerned with flavor. We bought a box of Great Northern popcorn.<br /><br />The box arrived and I was a bit concerned with the look of the oil in the packets... it didn't look like oil at all, but rather butter after you melt a solid stick and it cools and coagulates back into a solid. It was more yellow then orange, had a curdled/marbled look to it, and felt a bit stiff. I looked all over the packaging to find an expiration date, but there wasn't any. I checked the reviews and saw that people had said it was suppose to be solid, so I went ahead and tried it. Once the oil started heating up, it melted instantly, so everything seemed ok. Although the flavor was really good, the popcorn certainly wasn't very fresh. We figured that we were so use to the fresh local popcorn that we were being too overly critical of it, so we continued to make it every weekend.<br /><br />When we were almost out of popcorn packs, we bought Orville Reddenbacher popcorn and popcorn oil at the grocery store. The popcorn was MUCH fresher, but didn't taste anywhere near as good, so we bought another case of Great Northern from Amazon. This second case was completely different from the first. The oil in the packs was orange and actually looked like solidified popcorn oil. It was also much softer, almost like a gel. We popped a pack that night and was shocked at how much better it was... the popcorn was much fresher and simply fantastic.<br /><br />A few days later I found that a friend of ours had bought a box of Great Northern from another website and stopped eating it after the third pack. He said it was stale and not very enjoyable. I gave him a pack of ours and he loved it, so he's going to return the box he got and hope to get a fresher one.<br /><br />It's a shame that there aren't better quality controls with this popcorn... a simple expiration date on the outside of the case would assure that everyone gets a reasonably fresh supply. I added an image above to show the difference between a pack in our first box (old) and one from our second box (fresh). If you get an old case, I highly recommend returning it and getting a fresher case... it'll be the difference between getting a good bowl of popcorn and a Great one.<br /><br />If I had never bought a second case, I would have rated this 3 stars. The second case was definitely a 5-star rating, but due to the inability to tell how fresh the product is until you actually open it, I can't give it more then 3 stars. This is not Amazon's fault since they would have to open the boxes and have someone judge how good it looks prior to shipping. This is a pretty big issue since if it weren't for me, my friend would have tossed his case in the garbage and would have written Great Northern off as a low-quality brand.

review/summary: Un-Pop-Corn
review/text: I ordered a case of this popcorn using the automatic re-order system.  After reading some of the reviews about the quality of the popcorn, I chose to give it a chance, price being one of my primary reasons for ordering and the automatic re-order feature.  Well, as they say, you get what you pay for.  Only about 2/3 of the kernels pop and of the ones that do, the popped corn is very small in size.  The product tastes really good, what you're able to get from the package.  By the time you figure the amount of unpopped kernels, you would be much better off spending a little more money for a premium product.

review/summary: Very good, but a little overboard on the salt
review/text: I have a Pasadena popcorn machine from The Great Northern Popcorn company, so I though I'd try their pre-measured popcorn packets. Previously, I have used Vogel's pre-measured packs and compared to Vogels, this stuff is a bit saltier. It's very good, but Vogels is identical to movie theater popcorn in flavor; sweet, buttery, and more of the true corn taste then this.<br /><br />You can always reduce the amount of butter salt, or not add any at all from the packet. For my comparison, I used the entire packet contents which to me, produced popcorn with a bit to much saltiness.<br /><br />If you find this popcorn to be to salty, try Vogel's pre-measured packets.

review/text: This all in one pack of popcorn is great! Cut the end and dump it into your popcorn maker. I use the stove top maker to make mine. Though you really need a HUGE container (6 quart) to make it properly. While the popcorn is still popping I have to empty out the contents into a bowl because it makes a ton. The popcorn is very salty. I usually hold back a little of the salt to get the perfect taste. I really like this popcorn. Just like popcorn at the movies.

So if you don't want it salty, just don't cut open the seasoning portion of the three part package.

review/summary: Never Again
review/text: I ordered the Deluxe 6oz Red Popcorn Maker Machine by Paramount Entertainment and as an accompaniment I also ordered the Great Northern Popcorn, 6-Ounce Portion Packs (24 pack). The popcorn maker I like very much but the Great Northern Popcorn is terrible. The flavor isn't all that bad but only 2 ounces of the 6 oz package pop. With one pack, I thought I would give extra time but the unpopped kernels just burned, they never popped. The package itself is hard to use and I needed to cut it apart with a scissor before I could use it. Also, and this is the worst, one 6oz package has 900 calories. I usually eat popcorn as a low calorie treat but not this stuff. One person will end up eating the amount that pops and with the calories being in the grease package, all of the grease calories are put on the 2oz that pop. The last few packages I popped, I fed it to my dogs (which usually love popcorn). They had a few bites than left it alone. My solution - off the shelf popcorn with 3oz of canola oil and some sea salt - � the calories, 90% kernel pop and much better flavor.

review/text: The first pan was pretty oily, in fact I think the oil weighed more than the kernels. In the second pan I used only half the oil that came with it, it popped the same as the first pan and would have tasted good except for the extreme amount of salt.  this popcorn is so salty I couldn't eat it and my husband who is a salt addict even complained about too much salt!  I will add that the butter flavor does not taste like butter and has a very slight chemical aftertaste. I bought a case so we have a great deal to use yet.  in the future I'll try to sift the salt out of the popcorn before adding the kernels to the pan.  there were many old maids and the popped kernels were not as big and fluffy as Redenbacher's.  Also one pack only made about 1/2 pan of popcorn in my whirley-pop popcorn maker which is too bad as i had hoped it would be just the right amount.  I'm very disappointed in the quality of this popcorn.  At the price I expect a so called gourmet popcorn to make a whole pan, taste better and pop fluffier than what I can get from grocery store kernels.
