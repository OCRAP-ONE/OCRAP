review/summary: She likes it!
review/text: Got this for my 8 month old granddaughter.  The vote is in - she likes it! I love the fact that they have figured out a way to make babies enjoy eating their vegetables.  What baby would not like to eat their greens if they taste like pears?  These convenient size pouches are great to take anywhere to feed baby on the go.  They can be served warm or cold.  To warm, just sit in warm water for a minute or so and voila!  The 4.5 oz size of this pouch is perfect for one meal.  I can see it also being perfect as a snack for an older toddler - both healthy and delicious.  These gourmet baby foods are gluten free, have no thickeners, no dairy, no sugars, no egg or lactose and are nut free.  The pouch can be closed back up and stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.  On their website are recipes available to use these baby foods.  I have used applesauce in baking before but never any other type baby food.  This would be interesting to give a try.  You can never get too much of wholesome, organic vegetables.  Great product.

review/summary: Baby loves it!
review/text: This is the first baby food puree I have ever fed my daughter that I didn't make myself, and she absolutely loved it.<br /><br />I chose to make all of G's food because I have the ability and time to do so, and also because I just don't trust most food companies and that includes baby food makers.  As a family, we eat clean - so why would I feed my daughter products with random ingredients?  I'm satisfied with the contents of this pouch, its nutritional value and its claim that it does not contain additives, preservatives, etc.<br /><br />These organic pouches are wonderfully tasty (yes, I did try it myself) since the predominant taste is the sweet pear.  I think they're great to keep on hand, but they do have a pretty short shelf life (about 6 months).<br /><br />I found it odd that the pouches are NOT recyclable.<br /><br />I'll likely keep these on hand and use them for traveling since they're easy to get through TSA, but will continue to make majority of my daughters purees.

review/summary: tasty
review/text: I tasted this before feeding it to my nephew.  It tastes just like you would expect apple sauce to taste if it were made with pears.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Delicious - my nephew loved it, both plain and mixed in with his baby oatmeal<br />- The cap was easy to twist off<br />- It's easy to dispense.  No scraping around inside with a spoon.  You can squeeze it all out really easily<br />- Organic, no GMO, no pesticides, etc etc<br /><br />CONS<br />- It really is bulkier than a little jar of stage 1 food.  Those can be stacked and they really just don't take up as much room.  You could fit 20 jars in a cupboard in the same space where you could fit maybe 8-10 of these<br />- The box mine came in was sticky because one of the bags inside was leaking and had to be tossed.  That's probably not typical, but it did happen to me and is worth noting.<br /><br />OTHER FACTS<br /><br />- Kosher.  OU Certified on the box and individual packages<br />-  Vegan certified, with the V symbol on the box and individual packages<br />- The package is 4.5 ounces, which is supposedly 2 servings (according to Baby Gourmet) but it's not. (For reference, a jar of stage 1 baby food is generally 4 ounces.  So it's just slightly larger.)<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a very good product.

review/summary: Great tasting baby food!
review/text: As the mother of 1 y.o. twins, I am always on the lookout for tasty, organic baby foods that will satisfy my little munchkins.  My son has had allergic reactions to processed baby foods in the past, so I am always careful when introducing him to new foods. The first thing I always do when feeding my babies is to taste the food myself.  I was pleased by the taste of this baby food, it tasted mostly like pears, and you couldn't really taste the "greens."  Both of my babies eagerly ate up all of the food I had for them, and seemed to really enjoy it.  I monitored my son closely for any allergic reactions, and thankfully there were none.  That evening, I mixed another container of the baby food with some pureed chicken and once again, they happily ate up everything.  I was very pleased to find an organic baby food that was pleasant tasting and also offered something different than the usual offerings for baby food.<br /><br />NOTE - The next paragraph may offer more information than the average user wants :)<br /><br />A side effect of this baby food is that it caused both of my babies to experience soft (but not loose) bowel movements.  This may not be an issue for some parents, but for me, it was actually a good thing.  My son has always required a laxative to have a BM his entire life, no matter how much fruit or juice I have given him.  My husband and I were both very pleased that this food seems to have helped him go to the bathroom on his own, without medication.  For that reason alone I will be ordering more of this flavor, as well as trying out some of the additional types.

review/summary: Soooo Good...
review/text: My son really enjoys eating these little packs of fruit and garden goodness. I tasted it myself (I actually taste most of what he eats anyways) and could really taste some distinctiveness between the garden greens and the pears. There is a lot that Baby Gourmet gets right in this, so I will start off with a short list according to my Amazon.com custom<br /><br />(+) No Sweeteners<br />(+) Organic<br />(+) Just about all the ingredients are easily identified / recognizable<br />(+) Easy to store<br />(+) Easy to reseal and re-store<br />(+) Feeds clean<br />(+) BPA free packaging (this should be a given, but... just to be sure)<br /><br />We have a 15 month old son who can be finicky with his veggies. In the past, we've made smoothies and mixed fruit juices and fruits to add a little sweetness to his spinach and greens. These packs and their ingredients work on a very similar premise.<br /><br />What's inside the pack:<br />Consistency: the contents are kind of like the consistency of a fine applesauce<br />Taste: As mentioned before, the predominant taste is pear, but you definitely get some earthy undertones from the garden greens<br />Can you put it in a spoon? Yes.<br />Would it mix well? Yes. As mentioned, it's got the consistency of applesauce, so this might go well with whole grains or even as a spread on toast.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great food product. It has so much in it that's great for our children and there's not a lot of worry about what they're actually eating. When our son first started with food other than breast milk, we gave him a vegetable puree that we made on our own. Baby Gourmet lets you skip the "on your own" part without skimping on ingredients. This is definitely worth a try-and-buy!

review/summary: Baby Food That Tastes Like Real Food
review/text: To be honest with you, there's not really anything about this product that you can't love. There are several reasons.<br /><br />First, it's organic, and with all the insane things that are being done to destroy our foods these days, you want food that is as pure as possible for your baby.<br /><br />Second, there's not a lot of packaging to get rid of. Even better though, you can take this product with you, it doesn't have to be refrigerated, and the way it's packaged makes it very convenient to carry, dispose of, and use while you're out and about.<br /><br />The thing I liked the most about it, or that is my granddaughter did, is that it takes really good. It tastes like fresh pears, not what you would normally get with baby food where it's been pureed and processed to the point that it's bland.<br /><br />Who knows? Maybe you can't mess up pears when you're creating baby food for babies. Then again, I've tried several differnt brands, and in my opinion, after tasting this, it does taste the best. Might be a little expensive for you, but if you want organic for your baby, I highly recommend this. The portions are pretty generous too.

review/summary: My son LOVES this food!
review/text: My seven month old son absolutely LOVES the Juicy Pear and Garden Greens. It is a combination of pears, broccoli, and spinach. When I saw that I wasn't too sure how he would like it. But after the first bite he was hooked! He eats a full pack of it in one sitting! Technically each pack has two servings but I would say that only pertains to babies who are just being introduced to solid foods. Because of this I do find this food to be quite expensive. I would love to say we would be buying them again but not until the price is lowered!

He really seemed to enjoy it.<br /><br />If you want to serve it warm, just stand the pouch in hot water, then squeeze and serve. Microwaving the pouch is not recommended.

I can understand the short shelflife of this product, it is 100% organic with no preservatives, no food dyes, no artificial colors or sweeteners.<br /><br />other than the cap issue (There is a warning on the pouch), I found no flaws in this product. It taste delicious and the baby loves it!

review/summary: When are they gonna make turkey/apple ones?
review/text: It's important for your baby to get proper nutrition these days, what with all the hormones and who-knows-what injected into seemingly everything. Baby Gourmet gives a helping hand with their line of Organic Simple Purees, a very nutritious food that won't have you worrying about what exactly is going into your baby's little tummy.<br /><br />All I can say about this product, since I'm not a baby and can't tell you myself what it's done for my growth, is that when I had my little brother try it at 8 months old, he loved it. After just a few packs, he started to recognize it, and would get happy whenever one was within his view. I tried a little sample myself and couldn't stand it. I love pears and broccoli, but they didn't mix together nicely in this form for my taste buds. That's just me though.<br /><br />All the nutrition info looks solid, and these are handy snacks to have on you. They fit perfectly in just about any bag/purse pocket. The only thing keeping this food from being a 5 star product is the price. If it's not a problem for you, more power to you, but that seems to be the main con for a lot of other people as well. Healthy and organic, you should at least let your little one try these out sometime to see how it goes.

review/text: The first selling point of this product is the handy squeeze pouch for the baby food. Easily squeezed out, it is easier than using a new spoon every time you take some baby food out of a jar. Still, I wonder how much remains in the pouch when it appears empty. I personally can't vouch for the taste. My daughter enjoyed the food, though she rejected it the first time. I like the fact that it is organic, so I know what my ddaughter is eating. I would certainly use this again.

review/summary: Tasty but expensive
review/text: The product was great. Amazon's ability to watch expiration dates leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Tasty Greens!<br />AWESOME packaging - this is by far the easiest to use pouch baby food I've tried. The spout in the corner just makes it so much easier to dispense by the spoonful. It stands up nicely.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Expensive.<br />- I was also shipped (by Amazon) baby food that was 1+ month expired. (7/13/12)<br />- AND it was clearly a return. (My shipping box contained a box with a return label TO Amazon and then that contained the baby food.)<br /><br />I used 2 of the pouches before I realized it was expired. (I smell and/or taste all her new food and it didn't taste unfresh or bad.) Expiration dates are usually overly cautious, especially with baby products, so I've continued to use the pouches but will probably not go past the 2 month expired mark. I guess the expiration date explains why they were free in the Vine program. If I'd paid for these, you can bet I'd be livid with Amazon.

review/summary: I wish that these were available when my children were babies
review/text: Although my children (all six of them) are in their 20's and 30's now, I am at the age when grandchildren are starting to become a part of my life.  I wanted to check out this product line since it would be nice to be able to send my daughter a monthly supply of high quality, healthy baby food.<br /><br />Back in the 80's, when most of my children were babies, I don't think that there was anything like this on the market.  We purchased mostly Gerber baby food in the little jars (I am sure that we went through hundreds if not thousands of those little jars over the years.)  The first thing that I liked about this product is the container itself.  I am not positive but I have to believe that the environmental footprint of this package is far smaller than the glass jars that we threw away in bulk back in the day (sorry, it was the 80's and recycling was not big back then.)<br /><br />I believe that just because a product says that they are organic doesn't mean that they are.  However, after looking at this company's website I feel pretty comfortable about their claim.  Organic is good since I would like to limit the chemicals that my grandchildren ingest and organic is a good start.<br /><br />I have to say that it was the taste that surprised me.  It was clean, bright and really fresh tasting.  I am looking forward to trying all of the varieties in this line.  If they all taste as good as this one I think that we have a winner here.  Once the grand-baby gets a chance to try this out (they live in another city) I will update this review.  As it is now, I am very, very pleased with it.

review/summary: Ordered July 26; received with pull date of July 13, 2012!
review/text: I recognize that the pull/use by dates on products are not "throw this away now" dates. However, when 12 packages of baby food are ordered AFTER the "best by" date, there is a real problem. I would not take the chance on ordering this product with this kind of stale dating, especially when a twelve pack is likely to last the typical baby several weeks or more.<br /><br />(Before noticing the expired date, we did try a bit of the food on a 10 month "subject," who found the flavor acceptable. However, he eats all kinds of vegetables, without the need for sweetening them with fruit, so there seemed little need to do such "sugar coating. In addition, the cost--and wasted packaging materials--does not compare well at all compared to his usual diet of home-cooked veggies from the garden and farmers market. They might be practical for travel emergencies, but otherwise, even when "current," would earn no more than two stars.)

This isn't intended to be a complete meal replacement. It is handy to bring along as another meal option.<br /><br />Price is reasonable for the quality ingredients at just less than $2 per pouch if you use Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. There are two servings in each 4.5-ounce pouch.<br /><br />Negatives<br /><br />The smooth texture can get boring quickly. Good advice: supplement the baby food with bits of cooked vegetables or baby cereal.

review/summary: Organic, healthy... but tastes weird
review/text: I agree with Terrence Aybar's review (at the time of this posting, it was the top review).<br /><br />This is good stuff -- if we're only focused on nutrition and ingredients -- and its texture makes it a nice 'supplemental' snack in between bottles of milk/formula on the way to eating actual baby food.<br /><br />The packs are very convenient and there's a good amount in each -- the pouch/cap to me is a handy alternative to the jar/lid.<br /><br />The only thing is -- babies don't really seem to be crazy about this flavor. Pears and mixed greens? They got a bit of the tanginess of slightly under-ripe pears mixed with the mineral-y bite of raw greens. I know it's healthy, but it's awfully tart for babies just getting used to transitioning away from sweeter milk or formula.<br /><br />Still, it's a neat product and has its uses... but you might consider trying a different flavor.

review/text: OK, here are some things that I like about this product.<br /><br />1)  It is organic!  Yay!<br />2)  There is a mix of fruits and vegetables.  You cannot find these combo's in the supermarket.<br />3)  It can easily be tossed into a diaper bag without worry that it will break.<br />4)  No need for a spoon!  Just squirt the food into the baby's mouth and they are happy!<br /><br />Here is what I don't particularly care for.<br /><br />1) The packaging is kind of difficult for a baby to squeeze.  With the way that the opening is placed, the baby normally tries to squeeze the sides together which doesn't make the baby food come out that easily.<br />2)  The opening is very small.  In my opinion, the opening should be the size of a bottle nipple so that a baby feels comfortable sucking on the spout.<br /><br />I really like this food and will buy more.  I hope the company can continue to make great combinations of fruits and vegetables to assist in overall nutrition for our babies.

review/summary: Good flavor; priced a little high
review/text: I have a 1 year old at home, who has been eating solid foods for the last 6 months. Among the foods we've fed him are similar pouch-style packets where you can squeeze the puree right into their mouths. Directions also say that you can squeeze it onto a spoon, but for me, if I'm using a packet, it's for convenience and I'm not wanting to bother with a spoon (or washing up afterwards).<br /><br />We've tried a number of different flavors and brands, so I jumped at the opportunity to try this new brand from Amazon Vine. The Juicy Pear and Garden Greens pouch tastes similar to one of the Plum Organic flavors, Spinach, Pea and Pear, although the Baby Gourmet is sweeter. Pear is by far the strongest flavor.<br /><br />My son was lukewarm on the taste. We've gone through 4 packets; it's taken 2 meal sittings (he gets other food along with it) for each packet. He normally loves just plain steamed broccoli and fresh pears, so I was surprised at his lack of enthusiasm. While he doesn't immediately push it away, he doesn't point to the bag to request it, either. However, it's definitely something an adult could eat; it is a pleasant enough taste experience. I have one at my desk as part of my emergency stash.<br /><br />Like other pouched food, the convenience can't be beat. It can be squeezed right in their mouths; no silverware needed. The cap is easy to screw off and screw back on. They are super easy to pack (we've used them on many long-haul flights) and you don't have to worry about the bag breaking. I like that it's organic.<br /><br />It loses an additional star for the nozzle placement and for price. I found the position of the nozzle to be a little odd: most packets have their food nozzle at the top. It makes getting the product out easier, in addition to not having a large flap of container to navigate when feeding a wiggly toddler. In terms of pricing, there are other similarly sized and quality products out there for better prices (and they are also organic purees). The quality and taste of the Baby Gourmet were not high enough to be worth the extra cost.<br /><br />I will keep these on my radar, however, and if the price becomes competitive, I would definitely consider buying them.

review/summary: Pricey, but good and healthy
review/text: We are a veggie-eating family. I train them from 6-8 months old to love their veggies. This is a great product to get some much-needed greens in their diet. This has pears, spinach,  broccoli and some lemon juice. I think it is palatable. Both my children think it's tasty. The pears give the spinach and broccoli a little sweetness. There is no added salt, sugar or other "stuff". Of course, you could make your own baby food for much cheaper, but this is nice for travelling when it is sometimes hard to find restaurants that serve green things.<br /><br />It is all organic, so you should be safe from chemicals and such. This is for Stage 1 babies, so the mixture is pretty thin. These squeezy packages are all the rage. if your baby is too young to suck out the veg, you can just squirt it into a bowl.<br /><br />The price is a little steep at $2.29 a pouch, but if you subscribe to Amazon's shipping program, you can get it down to $1.94 per pouch.<br /><br />I would get this again!

I have some health issues that make baby food a viable option at times, and I gave this a shot. Overall, it's wonderful. The taste is fantastic. The food is pureed spinach, broccoli and pears. There's no added sugar whatsoever, and the nutrition is great. Weird as it may sound, blending it with ice makes a really nice smoothie.<br /><br />Also, each pack comes with a LOT of food. Each individual container should have 2-3 servings, depending on the baby. The product is 100% organic, no preservatives or additives (and the taste proves it. Again, it's actually very good.) The shelf life is a little poor compared to some other brands, but I'd imagine that's the effect of the zero additives.<br /><br />I'm aware that the price is a little steep, but it's worth it if you can afford it. The nutrition, taste, and quality of the food make it worth every penny.

review/summary: All babies love to eat their greens, don't they?
review/text: What makes this product unique is how it has been packaged.  The baby food comes in pouches that have pourable spouts for ease of storing, packing for daycare, and you can open and shut them.  They are pourable and the plastic pouch is durable.  I personally didn't eat any of these organic baby meals but a friend's little boy did and he ate it all with no discernible complaints.

review/summary: Nice Upgrade From Applesauce
review/text: So I got these for... (be kind to me) my 8 year old boy.  No, he doesn't like baby food.  And no, I don't send these with him to school.  But yes, my son likes applesauce, and honestly, it just seems pretty void of a whole lot of nutrition.  So I thought I would give these a try.  And...he likes em!  I think they are probably low on the sweet side for his taste, but for a baby they would be fantastic.  I tasted them myself, as I learned when I was making baby food for my kids when they were babies, and I think it tastes nice.  I like the idea of having broccoli mixed with pear, instead of just sweet fruit all the time.  I also like that these are so portable, though I wish they could figure out how to recycle these.  Glass jars are at least recyclable.  I think they are pricey at about $2.50 each but it is 100% organic and is super portable.  I would recommend at least trying them.

review/summary: My Baby Loves it!
review/text: First off this pack comes in a nice cardboard box that makes it easy to store and take the pouches from.  The pouches are 4.5 oz. each which is just enough for a meal for my 6 month old or I split it with some oatmeal for breakfast. My baby girl loves the flavor and I love that it gives her both her fruits and veggies in this combination.  The package states its Organic, has no fillers/thickeners, unslalted/unsweetened, no dairy, no egg, no milk, gluten free, nut free and in BPA Free Packaging!  It is also perfect for on the go since you can feed your baby right from the spout (just have them suck on it like a juice box) and it is easy to carry (not in glass or bulky container.)

review/summary: 2-1/2 year-old loves them mixed in to plain yogurt
review/text: Instead of flavored yogurt, we buy purees and mix them in with plain yogurt.  Our 2-1/2 year-old asked specifically for the Baby Gourmet pear and greens puree the following day.  As an adult, I thought it tasted pretty good.  It was mildly sweet and tasty, so probably a little heavier on the pear than the greens.  Still, if it's healthy and enjoyed, then it works for me.  I would recommend the product.

review/summary: Tasty, Convenient and Pricy
review/text: Organic, natural flavors without preservatives, glutens or most items that cause allergies or sensitivities make this a healthy alternative.  Pear, spinach and broccoli is an appealing blend that's definitely not the green gooey veggie stuff I remember feeding my kids.  Yummy plain or mixed with the baby's oatmeal or rice cereal, hot or cold, the pouches travel well in the diaper bag without breakage or spills. They're easily stored but  must be refrigerated after opening. and have a short shelf life due to lack of preservatives.<br /><br />Depending on the age of the munchkin this can even be served directly from the pouch off the spoon or as a sipper.  Each pouch contains 2 servings, the only problem is the kids really like this a lot and practically INHALE these as sippers at $2+ a pouch (ouch!).  Yummy convenience at a price that makes this difficult to include in the regular menu rotation. Having seen these elsewhere at $50+ for 12 pouches, Amazon has the comparatively low price BUT it's still pricy. Subscribe and Save helps, but promotions, coupons and sales are essential before I'd include these into the regular menu rotation.

review/summary: My Baby Likes It
review/text: I like that this is an organic, healthy, all natural baby food in bpa-free packaging. Even more, I like that my selective eater will eat it! The rest of my family doesn't care for it, though. It's easily transported, although I wonder how biodegradable the pouch is. It was delivered February 27, 2012 and has an expiration date of July 13, 2012. The best thing overall about this product for me is that my baby will readily eat it. She's 11 months old and will let me squeeze it into her mouth, which is great for when we are on the go!

review/text: My 10-month-old baby likes the pear & garden greens. They taste great (I tried a little myself). Even my 3-year-old son likes to eat them. The pouches are great for feeding on the go. I throw a couple of them in my diaper bag, plus a spoon, and I'm done. The pouches won't break like glass or plastic containers and are light weight. If there is food left over, the pouch can be closed with a secure screw-on lid. Overall, a great product.

review/text: My grandson just loves these packets. He carries it around with him. He calls it his juice.<br />It's convenient to take to the park or any outing. When they were delivered, they were still a little cold which was nice. They are healthy too. They are gluten-free, nut-free, and dairy free. My grandson had health problems when he was born so he's had problems with eating. Anything that he likes to eat and that's good for him is a blessing. This is a blessing.<br /><br />]

review/summary: Finally an organic pouch that is low in sugar!
review/text: My 18-month-old baby hates eating fruits and vegetables in solid form, so we give her at least a pouch or two a day of fruits and veggies.  Until now, we have used the Plum Organics and Happy Baby brands, but those are high in sugar.  I don't know how Baby Gourmet does it, but these pouches have less than 1 gram of sugar per serving.  Most comparable pouches by other brands have 10-12 grams of sugar per serving.  Even without the sugar, this puree is sweet-tasting and pleasant to eat (my baby and I both agree).  I love giving my daughter a puree of pear, brocoli, and greens without all that extra sugar!<br /><br />Also, while these pouches cost more than the competing brands, they are substantially larger.  Each pouch contains 2 servings instead of the typical 1 serving.  For us, a pouch lasts 2-3 days, and we just store it in the refrigerator after opening.

review/summary: The kid loves it
review/text: Our son is a pretty good eater, although with jars/pouches he has some favorites and some that he really won't eat.<br /><br />This stuff quickly moved into the "favorite" category.  I was a little skeptical - pears and lettuce together? - but after the first bite, he actually asked for more.  We're happy too, since it's organic.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the standard "pouch" really needed an upgrade, but I have to say that it is easy to pour using the fancy new spout.<br /><br />UPDATE: the fancy new spout can be used as a straw!  We gave our son the pouch this evening and he "drank" it from the spout.  This may not sound like much, but he has not been eating his veggies lately, so this is a super-easy way to get some greens into him.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I have 6 month old twin grandsons who have just started on solids.  They aren't real sure they like to eat, yet.  We tried the Juicy Pear & Garden Greens out on them.  I was anticipating funny faces and it coming out on the chin since children do not usually like greens.  As Dr. Oz has said, vegetables are bitter and things in the wild that are poisonous are bitter, so rejecting bitter things is a safety thing ingrained in our DNA.  Much to our surprise, they really liked it.  It's nice to have vegetables they really like.<br /><br />The pouches are new to us.  You can heat the food by placing the pouch in hot water, or you can transfer it to a bowl and use the microwave, being careful to check for hot spots.  Room temp was fine for our guys.  The package says it contains 2 servings, so that is perfect for our two guys.

review/text: I make all of my own baby food but I was looking for a quick and easy substitue to use in a pinch, especially if we are out running around.  These "Baby Gourmet" packages are great to throw in a diaper bag and if you are out longer than you expect your baby won't be left hungry.  The packaging is really nice and doesn't get yucky even if it is in your bag for a a week or two.

review/summary: Very convenient!
review/text: Baby Gourmet comes in a squeezable pouch with a long straw-like nozzle and green screw on cap.  It can be served directly from the pouch or you can pour it out into a bowl.  My baby enjoyed sucking on the pouch, but be careful!  I tried to help by squeezing some out and it ended up coming out really fast and spilling on her bib. She seemed to get the hang of it and I believe this will help transition her to solid foods.<br /> The problem with using it this way is if your baby does not eat it all, you need to discard the rest because her spit has gone into the food.  Try this method if you are not worried about the waste or if your child usually eats a whole jar of baby food.<br />The food is organic and contains no added sugar.  The ingredients were simply pears, spinach, ascorbic acid, and organic lemon juice concentrate.  It is not very sweet, but it does taste pretty good-yes I tried it.  I could only taste the pears.<br />Obviously the price is higher than other kinds of foods.  Therefore I recommend this product to mothers who can afford to pay a little extra and who are especially concerned about feeding their baby pure ingredients and dont have the time to make it at home.

review/summary: It's watery; baby likes it with cereal
review/text: I've been getting pouches like these for my eight month old grandson, and he hasn't learned to suck them out of the bag yet like so many others have reported. He really prefers to eat only finger food that he can pick up and isn't keen at all on being spoon fed anymore, so I have to kind of distract him to get him to let me spoon the food. The very thin ones like this he will only eat if they have some texture to them, so I squeeze it out into a bowl and add baby oatmeal or baby brown rice cereal. The flavor is good; this one isn't so sweet as some of the apple-pea, etc ones I've tried. I don't have him too often (and he doesn't eat these for his parents), so I may not be able to use them up before expiration. Actually, though, I like them well enough to eat them myself, so I just toss a couple in my car (though I actually think this one tastes better cold), and I have veggies for when I am out and about. These packets are four and a half ounces, considered two servings for baby at 40 calories each, and 2 grams of fiber. They are a good source of Vitamin C (70%) and also have Vitamin A (25%). I am pleased with this combo, and would like to try more of their "advanced stages" products with more texture. Hope this helps.<br /><br />*update: he has learned to sip the puree out of the pouch now and seems to be enjoying it more. I have to supervise, though, because he will sip a bit and then try to play with the pouch, and it will quite easily drip out of the top if he gets it upside down. Just letting him take some sips, then put it away and offer more later.

review/summary: Good..she ate it.
review/text: Of course I tasted this prior to giving it to my 17 month old daughter. I took taste the spinach, but the sweetness of the pears quickly over powered that flavor. It tastes similar to Naked Green juice but not nearly as sweet. My daughter is used to eating the Happy Baby food brand squeezable pouches so she was able to navigate the pouch easily. Unlike Happy Baby though, this product does not contain the Omega-3 rich grain Salba.

review/text: These fruit squeezes are made only of pear, broccoli, spinach and lemon juice. Given their sweetness, I assume they are primarily pear. However, for a snack that travels well and needs no preparation, they are reasonably healthy. My 2.5 year-old-son really enjoyed this flavor. At first he was a bit thrown off by the odd shape of the package and placement of the straw relative to other fruit squeezes, but he quickly got over it.

review/text: I tasted the stuff... seriously I did... and it's not at all unpleasant.  I figured to be fair though I needed to send it to the expert... my 17 month old Liam.  I know, he is too old, it says 6 months+, but I figure Liam doesn't know he's almost 3x that old..  My wife squirted a little on her finger and popped it in his mouth.  He kind of sat there with a confused "new taste" look on his face.  I'm certain he was pondering the contrast of the sweet pear taste vs. the slight spinach/broccoli combined with it... (you could tell) then he smiled.  Before long he was treating the pouch like a sippy cup and clapping.  I think that was his way of telling me that this should be a five star review.  Just one additional note...  Liam has been amazingly open to new tastes since birth.  I in no way would use Liam as a guage for whether or not this would be an attractive food to a fussy eater... but he is an example of the target audience who seemed to very much enjoy the product.  If you buy, I hope you have as good luck as I did with Liam and thanks for taking the time to read my review.

review/summary: Really Good...Price and Shelf-Life Debatable
review/text: This baby food is amazingly good! This is an extremely fine blend of pear/broccoli/lemon juice concentrate (with a little added vitamin C). Baby would not likely reject this at all-no real hint that veggies are blended in with the fruit, whatsoever.  It is a very smooth, uniform consistency.<br /><br />I'm amazed to find that that such a superior taste is achieved without any fillers/thickeners, sweeteners/salt, dairy, egg, lactose, nut or gluten.<br /><br />Additionally, the packaging is described as being "BPA Free," which is so important to us. We've already taken steps to minimize plastic storage in other areas by using glass jars to keep our leftovers in the fridge.  Unfortunately, glass isn't very convenient for packing on the go. I like that you don't have to deal with having to use glass jars to travel with baby by using this resealable, BPA free packaging.<br /><br />Great taste, convenience, quality ingredients and safe packaging...nothing is sacrificed with this product EXCEPT for the fact it comes at a higher cost along with a shorter shelf-life.<br /><br />At 12 4.5oz pouches, this price point (currently over $26) seems quite high, especially in an age where consumers have the option of making their own blended baby food at home-even using popular BPA free blenders/food processors on the market.<br /><br />However, this would be nice to use as a back-up if one would have to leave out quickly with baby without having the time/energy to blend and pack that day (have to blend on same day to preserve vitamins if it's not canned/vacuum sealed).  In that event, I can see the option of buying some.  Unfortunately, the shorter shelf-life (in my case, 5 mos. from receiving product) does not allow the typical household to take full advantage of this scenario in an especially cost effective way.

review/text: Having tasted this pear puree with broccoli and spinach, I can confirm this is a meal I'd like to eat myself.<br />The package makes taking a custom amount extremely convenient, although, as the package warning says, the cap (unlike a jar cap) could be a choking hazard.<br />The package has "nutrition facts" on it which would suggest, via percentages, that the half a packet serving size has almost no nutritional value, but one must assume that this was based upon the nutrition needs of an adult and is less that useful in planning baby's meals.<br />Without a baby, these would make terrific snacks for adults who are hiking or otherwise away from a kitchen, because no utensils would be required to open and "suck up" a packet.

review/summary: A Decent Treat for Pet Snails...
review/text: Well, first off, I guess I should say that this review is going to be a bit different.  I got this for an unusual reason.  I have no baby, I got this instead to make special jello treats for my pet garden snails.  Yes, you heard me right - pet snails.  So, this review is for all you snail owners out there!<br /><br />I love the fact that this product is organic and has no added filler/preservative junk.  If you keep snails you know that they are very sensitive and delicate beasts and you have to be careful about feeding them stuff with added chemicals.  Disturbingly, though, mine was already expired by the time I got it (it expired July 2012).  I'm assuming it'll still be fine, but that means that this stuff goes bad super fast or I got a case that was already really old.  Either way, it makes buying huge cases of the stuff from amazon kind of questionable.<br /><br />Now, onto the actual use.  I wanted to make jello treats for my beloved snails.  This involves taking about 6 oz. of baby food and mixing it with about a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin.  This makes a sort of vegetable gelatin.  The snails liked the jello treats okay, but it turns out that they liked the baby food just straight much better.  Go figure. Well, either way, the fine puree of baby food is a great way to get them to eat stuff they might normally be picky about (for example, if you are having trouble getting them to eat their calcium supplements, you can hide calcium powder in the baby food).  I've also found that it doesn't mold all that quickly in a snail tank.  In fact, it lasts longer than bananas, which was very surprising.  As for the disturbingly fast expiration date, even though I haven't tried it yet, I imagine you could freeze it in ice cube trays or tupperware and then defrost it later.  I've tried this with fresh ground veggies and it worked fine with those so I imagine it would work fine with the baby food.<br /><br />This is a decent  choice for snails, but I should mention price.  I bought some baby food in my local grocery store that had absolutely no added preservatives/chemicals in it, and it was about 17 cents an ounce.  This is 51 cents an ounce.  SO, much more expensive.  In fact, if I hadn't gotten it through Vine, I wouldn't have bothered to buy such an overpriced baby food.  So, if you have pet snails, this is a fine enough choice for them but maybe a bit overpriced.  Personally, though, I'm just going to stick to using leftover fresh veggies and grind them up in a food processor and freeze those for later use.  However, if you're feeling lazy, really want something that can store longer than fresh veggies, or just want to give your beloved snails a soft mushy treat, then organic baby food would be a fine enough choice for your snail-feeding needs.

review/summary: Don't buy because its "green"
review/text: Don't buy this just because it is a natural product, buy it because you want healthy food in a convient (but extremely wasteful) packet.  Taste is terrible from my perspective, it is pears, broccoli, and spinach; blech.  Baby will probably like it if you don't get them addicted to sweet foods first.  They claim it isn't sweetened, but pears are an extremely sweet fruit, but at least they don't add additional sweeteners.<br /><br />I saw some reviews saying it doesn't have preservatives, this is not true, it has ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and lemon juice concentrate, which are both preservatives, and the latter is actually a sweetener too but it is the last ingredient so it doesn't really add much sweetness.<br /><br />My neutral review is because baby food like this is extremely easy to make and doesn't produce all the extra disposable packaging, just give a shot to making your own food first and buy these for when you need a convenient package.  All you really need to make your own is a steamer pan if you want to cook it first and a blender to mix stuff up.  I would definitely recommend this food over the food in the glass jars, but I would recommend making your own over this, and it is not as much work as you might think.

review/text: I wish I'd had these for my other children when they were little! These are perfect--they are portable, full of good nutrients, and my baby/toddler LOVES them. She gets her vegetables this way, I'm happy knowing she is, and she sucks them down easily without spills. When she was little, 6-9 months or so, it was harder for her to figure it out without spilling everywhere, but still easier than letting her use her own spoon and baby food jar. Then, as she got older, these became the go-to transportable snack/meal. Easy, portable, and healthy! I will be giving my child these for a long time!

review/text: This product is too sweet to qualify as real baby food. Dessert, yes, nutrition - no. Too many carbs -- no protein.<br /><br />All the ingredients are organic, which is very nice. The pouch is BPA free which is great. There is no gluten, which is also a good thing. The pouch is easy to squeeze into baby's bowl. The cap, which could be a choking hazard to a baby -- is recyclable.<br /><br />The pouch would also, IMHO, be a good qualifier for a quick carb boost for a casual jogger or hiker. The used pouch would be easy to flatten and pack back home with you to properly dispose of. The cap is recyclable.<br /><br />So this is nice and sweet and good for a fun meal for baby, but I am not thriled with its role as a nutritious baby food.

review/text: The ingredients in this product are obviously the attraction.  Organic Pears, broccoli, spinach, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C).  One thing I liked, and I assume it is because the product is natural and not soaked with preservatives, but the package we received expired within a few weeks of us receiving it.  I don't think it was old, maybe someone else can tell me the normal shelf-life for this product.  But I never feel good about food that seems to never spoil...Twinkies?<br /><br />All of the good things aside, if baby won't eat it, it doesn't matter what is in the package.  Baby loved it!  She loved it so much that I even tasted a little...it gave me a slight pucker, but generally sweet and aside from baby-food slimy, I would have eaten it too.<br /><br />The pouches are cool.  I buy applesauce for my older son in pouches like that and he drinks right out of them.  For baby however, that won't work.<br /><br />We don't microwave anything, so never an option for us.  However, even if it was an option, it isn't one for these pouches.  But why would anyone go organic and then microwave the life out of the food anyway?  So I find the microwavability a non-issue.<br /><br />A bit pricey, but worth it.

review/summary: Yummed it up!
review/text: This baby food was yummed right up by little Owen. He liked it so much he wanted to suck it right out of the container (which he did and is an easy way to let your baby eat). It is just a bit more runny than apple sauce. Owen is a picky eater and doesn't like vegetables so this was a great way to give him the nutrition he needs while keeping him VERY happy. Thanks for this great product!

review/text: Great option for those parents who are organically inclined.  My sisters great grandbaby seemed to like this quite well.  At least more stayed in his mouth than came back out.<br />The package is very handy as long as the screw top is kept away from older children inclined to swallow things.  The manner of serving is cleaner and more sanitary than the jars.

review/text: I only wish they had this stuff when my kids were little. They would have definitely eaten all of their vegetables then!!<br /><br />I tasted this baby food before I gave it to my best friend for her daughter to try and it tastes pretty damn good for being just baby food lemme tell ya. Her daughter loves it and inhales it when it comes time to eat. Now it's all that my friend buys for her.<br /><br />Although I do find it to be kind of expensive, the nutritional value is high and if the babies like it, then why not.

review/summary: Quality food that baby likes, but what a waste of plastic!
review/text: The quality of the food is good.  Lots of healthy greens hidden among tasty pear.  Even though my baby is heading out of the baby food stage, she ate all 12 packets of this food quite quickly.<br /><br />For the organic food that is tasty and healthy, I'd give it five stars.  For packaging, I'd give it one star.  I'd be happy to purchase this product in a recyclable glass jar (I also feel better about nothing harmful leeching into my baby's food when it is in glass).  But the amount of plastic wasted per serving really turns me off.  Yes, it's slightly less messy when on the road.  But really, it's not that hard to bring along a spoon and a couple of wipes.

review/summary: I Even Liked It!
review/text: When I saw this on the Amazon Vine Program I knew I wanted to get it for my 7 month old grandson, Reid.  He is relatively new to baby food, eating mostly cereal with a little fruit.  I wasn't sure how he would like the Garden Greens and Juicy Pear but he almost devoured them.  He LOVED them.  This is really a great way to get baby to eat their greens, such as broccoli.  They were also  very easy to heat.....just set them in some hot water & they are quickly warmed.  The packaging is great, just be careful with the little caps as they could be a choking hazard.  Of course the really big plus is "organic".  My daughter-in-law loved this.  The only problem with this product is the price....it is a little pricey.  I really wish it was more affordable, because it seems to be an excellent product.  I give it 5 stars and will probably pay the price for my sweet grandson.

review/text: Ok, so I got this product for free. I fed it to my 3-year-old, which is far outside its recommended age range. She LOVED it. Perhaps it doesn't have the correct balance of nutrition for her, but she was simply using it as a snack in the car each morning.<br /><br />So, from a taste standpoint... five stars.<br /><br />I can't comment on the other qualities of the product.

review/summary: Pear puree:  it's not just for toddlers anymore
review/text: THE KID:  Mom, why is there BABY food on the kitchen counter?<br /><br />ME:  I'm making bulgogi tonight. (Bulgogi is the quintessential barbecued beef dish of Korea, where thin slices of rib eye or other meat is marinated with soy sauce, sesame oil, sweet rice wine, onion, garlic, ginger, and grated asian or "apple" pear.  It's so rich that just a few ounces of bulgogi seems decadent, as part of a rice and veggie-filled meal.)<br /><br />THE KID:  Out of BABY food?<br /><br />ME:  It's pear puree.  I couldn't find a good fresh pear at the market.  And sometimes I have the bulgogi ingredients but forget the pear.  This is convenient.<br /><br />THE KID:  Um...Does it taste like baby food?<br /><br />ME:  Try it.<br /><br />(pause)<br /><br />THE KID:  Uk!  What ELSE is in there?<br /><br />ME:  Let's see, broccoli, and I think spinach.<br /><br />THE KID:  Ew.  And it's slimy, too.<br /><br />ME:  So that it's easier for toddlers to get the whole pear, pulp and all.  Also, it's an easier way to get vitamins and healthy vegetables into toddlers.  Things have changed since you were a baby.  Parents used to give their kids a lot of plain juice, but babies who just drink the fruit and avoided the veggies were missing out on what they needed to be healthy.<br /><br />THE KID:  So does the marinade taste like spinach?<br /><br />ME:  I haven't put the meat in the marinade yet, so try some of that.<br /><br />(pause)<br /><br />THE KID:  Yeah, it's good.<br /><br />ME:  And it doesn't make the marinade all watery like when I used "grown-up" pear juice that other time.<br /><br />THE KID:  So you're getting more of this?<br /><br />ME:  I dunno.  It is organic.<br /><br />THE KID:  Which is good for you, and promotes sustainable farming.<br /><br />ME:  You *were* watching that documentary after all!  But there are other organic brands that cost half as much, so I don't know what I'll try next.<br /><br />THE KID:  Isn't it better if it's more expensive?<br /><br />ME:  Not necessarily.  Sometimes you are paying for advertising or the idea that paying more means you're getting something better.  This is really good stuff  - it *almost* makes me want to drink broccoli even - but it's also packaged in all this non-recyclable stuff, and that packaging is expensive, too.<br /><br />THE KID:  Can I take a pack to school before it's gone, then?  I want to switch it with someone's Capri sun at lunch and see if they notice the difference.<br /><br />ME:  Ew.<br /><br />(The above is a dramatization of actual events.  Following a hint I got out of a cookbook, I really do keep small containers of baby/toddler pear puree in my pantry for bulgogi.  This reviewer wholeheartedly recommends the flavor of this product as being delicious in a Korean marinade.  And we've got to find a way to stop shoveling juice pack carcasses into the landfills, because in the end that, too, is bad for all our babies.)

review/summary: Simple, delicious, pure food, as nature intended
review/text: Putting vital nutrients into your baby is obviously imperative, as you're starting them on the path to a life of (hopefully) good health. Baby Gourmet makes the task that much easier, by providing delicious, nutritious organic foods, in a convenient squeezable pouch. And the Juicy Pear & Garden Greens should be on the top of every parent's shopping list.<br /><br />Having sampled the product myself, I can say the texture is smooth and easy to digest -- perfect for getting your little one started on blended foods; and the taste is very flavorful, slightly sweet and fresh, as if I personally pureed the ingredients that morning. The pear really comes across, as do the earthy greens. Here is a quick breakdown of the nutrient data, as well as ingredients:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1/2 Package (64g)<br />Calories: 40<br />Total Fat: 0<br />Sodium: 0mg<br />Total Carb: 9g<br />Dietary Fiber: 2g<br />Sugars: less than 1g<br />Protein: 0g<br /><br />Vitamin A: 25%, Vitamin C: 70%, Calcium: 100%, Iron: 2%<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Organic Pear, Organic Broccoli, Organic Spinach, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate<br /><br />The relatively high price may prevent some from purchasing, but you'd be doing yourself -- and your infant -- a disservice by purchasing food that may not be made of such fine ingredients. As they say, you get what you pay for! Overall, Baby Gourmet Juicy Pear & Garden Greens is an outstanding baby puree, made of quality, wholesome nutrients, that's fit for your infant and, really, family members of any age!

review/text: I have 6 month old twin girls and both of them eat this with reasonable vigor.  They don't go for it quite as well as something like apples or sweet potatoes but they will eat it without protest.  I like that's it's easy to squeeze out just what we need and save the rest for a later snack.  I could see this being very handy for sending baby food to a day care where glass containers may not be allowed.

review/summary: Always check the "Best if used by: " date!
review/text: Our baby has tried 4 of the flavors from the Baby Gourmet Simple Purees and likes all of them.<br /><br />In full disclosure, I must tell you that the first shipment I received of this had "Best if used by: " dates that expired by 2 months!  I contacted Amazon and they re-sent some more, but guess what, that shipment was ALSO expired.  Amazon then just cancelled my order.<br /><br />I wrote Baby Gourmet corporate and they were more than gracious and offered to send me some cases free of charge.  They were very responsive and friendly and said they would work with Amazon to ensure this did not happen again.  (I took them up on their offer and their shipment was fine, not expiring for awhile)<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is organic, our baby likes it, the packaging and re-usability is excellent and the variety is good.  We have since purchased several more from the local stores and of course....we check the "Best if used by: " date.<br /><br />(We have friends' with a toddler who simply open the cap and he just sucks the puree from there, with essentially no mess.  We look forward to that day, soon.)

review/summary: Tastes great... But my shipment was old (best buy July 20th) I got them in August 20th
review/text: Now I am not a child but I have been accused of acting like a child quite often in life so I feel that I am qualified to review this product.<br /><br />One thing to note these do taste great I mean I've always had a thing for baby food and these are healthy organic and delicious. The one thing I was most concerned with when I received my order was that the best if used by date was more than a month past the date my order arrived. Now I'm not somebody who freaks out about expiration/best if used by dates because let's be real most things are fine long after that date has elapsed. But apparent of a child that 6+ months old is going to be very concerned with that. So not sure why would get one so past-due but they were fine to me.<br /><br />Now since that I am an adult I did an adult thing and mixed mine was a little bit of vodka (I do not recommend doing this for children remember drink responsibly) but it made a delicious vodkas smoothly that I enjoyed and will probably enjoy again in the future.<br /><br /> anyway I hope you found this useful be awesome!

review/summary: Really good but beware of expiration date
review/text: I ordered this in August 2012 and when it got to me, it had the Best by date of July 13, 2012. I didn't realize this until after I had fed my baby this a few times. It didn't seem to make a difference with her (no bad reactions) and I did taste it too and it tasted fine. I will probably dump the rest out but this tastes really really good.<br /><br />I enjoyed it myself and my daughter will wolf this down. It's so good that now if we give her straight pear, she won't eat much of it.<br /><br />This is definitely really good and the ingredients are all natural without extra unnecessary chemicals in there. It has broccoli, spinach, pears, etc. I actually can understand the ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, this is really yummy and babies will love this but just beware to check the date on it right away as it may be expired.

review/summary: YUM. Somewhere between applesauce and a green smoothie
review/text: This is a delicious product - and yes - I tasted it myself. It's like applesauce in texture and taste, but is also very velvety and sweet, like a smoothie. The broccoli and spinach add a nice depth to the pears. The hint of lemon is welcome.<br /><br />Just for information, a serving is considered half the package and contains 40 calories.<br /><br />I'm happy with the product on many levels: there is no added sugar, salt, fat, coloring or complicated preservatives. There are two grams of fiber, and this is a good source of Vitamin C (70% of the daily allowance). The produce is certified as organic. There isn't a bad thing to complain about.<br /><br />The resealable cap stays on properly and is made of recyclable plastic. The package itself is recyclable aluminum (just rip off the plastic spout, and recycle that too).<br /><br />My only criticism is slight - the first time I squeezed the product while bringing it to my mouth, a large goop flew out and landed on my shirt. I guess there is a small learning curve to eating from the tube directly.<br /><br />The product is tasty when cold, and easy to eat right from the package once you get the hang of it. You could also pour the food into a bowl, use it as an ingredient in a larger meal/dessert, or heat it up for serving. Since the package is aluminum, it is NOT microwaveable.<br /><br />I plan to take the packets backpacking. They really are tasty. The packaging is lightweight and sturdy, and I look forward to adding this to my outdoor meal rotation.

review/summary: Not for preschoolers, I guess
review/text: I got this item based on reviews saying that older kids liked it and that you couldn't taste the garden greens at all.  My son is four and I have a horrible time getting any kind of vegetable into him so I thought I'd try these.  Plus, I thought he'd like the novelty of sucking the fruit out of a pouch.  I gave him the first one, he sucked a tiny bit into his mouth, and handed it back to me and said, "That's nasty."  I assume for babies, this wouldn't be a problem since, let's face it, a lot of baby food is nasty, but my preschooler gave it a big thumbs down.

The title says "6 months +" but beware that a baby that old will not know how to operate the squeeze-and-suck skill to actually eat what's inside.<br /><br />The first time I opened it I ended up putting it into a bowl for her to spoon eat. Great for travel, but logistically difficult if you want to avoid a mess.

review/text: Our now 11 month old son eats these. We usually make our own food and freeze it, but sometimes we're on the run and don't have the ability to store frozen food, so something like this is a blessing. It smells and tastes pretty good to an adult palate, and the little guy eats them up.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Shelf stable so it can slip in the diaper bag for a long time<br />- Won't leak, break, or mess up - and the cap is tough enough to get off that it won't slip<br />- He actually eats it<br />- Organic<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It's a bit thin. We usually bring some cereal along to thicken it up and he loves it. For a smaller baby, I'm sure the thinness would work well.

I tried a pouch myself, and it's tasty to me, for baby food, and my daughter really likes it as well.  When we're out and about and it's mealtime for her, this simple puree squirts right out of the pouch onto a spoon, or a Boon Spoon actually fits right on the end of the pouch, which makes it even simpler.  At home, I mix Juicy Pear and Garden Greens in with other baby food meals or with some cereal.  And because it's organic, I feel good about giving it to my daughter.

review/summary: Convenient
review/text: These food packages are advertised for 6 months and older - while the consistency of the food is fine for a 6 month old, giving the package to a 6 month old to manipulate can result in a big mess, so it's best to serve it by spoon.  However, older children can basically drink the contents like juice, but without the sugars and artifical ingredients.  What I most appreciate about this product is that it doesn't have any added sugar, the food is organic, and the packaging is BPA free.  It's also a bit more convenient for transporting than the baby food jars.

review/text: Tasting this myself, I could definitely taste the "greens".  It seems form reading other reviews that most kids won't mind.  My 18 month old however did not care for the product.  This may have been however due to the fact that she seems to be transitioning off of baby food in general.  Maybe the conclusion there is that some pickier eaters may not care for this, and you should try one before you buy a case.

review/text: I tried this product and as an adult, I thought it was very pleasant. Nice pear flavor with a bit of green taste at the end. We fed some to 2-3 yr olds who are crazy about the applesauce that comes packaged like this. They wolfed it down. I love that they are easy to take with you, even in a Gramma purse.<br />However, the price is ridiculous. Even using the cheapest option, these packs of baby food are $1.95 each. Compared to other organic options, the clever packaging makes these more than double the price. That takes them into the realm of "occasional snack or travel food" instead of "keep on hand". Too bad.

Although a big green opening does make it easy to open the package, unless you have bad motor skills, you don't need it to be THAT big.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: A good, healthy product with no artificial ingredients.

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: My first impression: pears mixed with green beans????? Strange.  My second impression: convenient packaging? It was not more convenient than a jar in my opinion.<br />I tasted this first and was surprised that I did not gag--I can't stand most baby foods.  It really wasn't a terrible combination and the pear taste was a little stronger than the bean without being overwhelming.  As far as taste, the most important factor (the baby), reallyenjoyed the food.<br />I don't believe that having "organic" plastered all over the product should make the consumer feel safe.  The design of the product didn't bowl me over either and packaging in not biodegradeable.  I don't find this package any more convenient than traditional jars--and jars can be recycled.  In fact, once a baby is eating more (finishes a jar), the jar is more convenient since the baby can be fed directly from the jar.  IF hot water is available, a jar can be placed in it as easily as the pouch in order to warm the food.

review/summary: Delicious and Nutritious
review/text: Baby Gourmet Organic Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Baby Food is a convenient snack that manages to pack healthy ingredients into a delicious snack.  The taste of pear is really evident and the vegetables will go mostly unnoticed by your little one.  It has just the right amount of sweetness, though no sugar is added.  The ingredients are all organic and there is a good balance of fruit and vegetables.  The packaging is easy to use for both squirting out the puree or letting your child drink straight from the container.  Overall, this is an excellent product that tastes better than most competing fruit and vegetable purees.

review/summary: Accurate ingredient list - good taste but don't forget baby needs protein & fat
review/text: My reason for ordering the wasn't just to feed it to my baby since we make a great deal of our own baby food (breast milk and homecooked and blended vegetables, supplemented with heathy proteins and fats very low on the added sweeteners, which includes fruit juices).  I ordered it to try out the packaging, and a competing brand of Organic baby food side by side and also to see if this was something  someone I know with swallowing issues could tolerate with ease and enjoy.  So that said, unto the main review:  Let me first tell you that if you are willing to pay a little more to make sure your baby isn't exposed to the BPA that lines the tops of most baby food jars or give them added starches & salts, this is a VERY GOOD product and one that is labeled ACCURATELY by weight.  That, in and of itself is hard to find these days!  The Puree consists of Organic Pears,  Organic broccoli, Organic Spinach, Ascorbic Acid & Organic Lemon Juice.  The last 2 ingredients are likely there not just for flavor but to help retard the growth of any bacteria since this product has no other preservatives.  Its shelf life is about 3 months since mine were dated as sell by  July 13, 2012.  Baby Organic doesn't disguise the fact that their's is a fresh product needing to be consumed quickely and I like that.<br /><br />As far as a fruit serving goes, and this IS a fruit - the vegetable in the product is not enough by weight to add much beyond some good extra vitamins & iron.  The suggested serving size is 1/2 the package but most people will find an older baby will be able to or will want to eat  the entire thing so it's more like 80 calories instead of the suggested 40.  In way way, that is good news, however, since that means the product gives your child 4% of the needed proten for the RDA (hopefully the rest is coming from breast milk or an approriate formula) 50% of the RDA for Vitamin A, 140% of the RDA for Vitamin C, no calicium to speak of even though spinach is supposed to be a good source (tells ya something) and 4 % of of the RDA for Iron.<br /><br />The biggest concern I have with this product is the packaging since that big plastic cap looks like a toy and if your child is clever enough to get it off the pouch once emptied, you know it's going stright into their mouth where it woull be chewed upon and possible choked upon.  Until they solve this issue by coming up with a better re-sealable nozzle, please immediately lock away all the caps up high and afr away from kids if you plan to recyle them.  The cap alone is why I took of 1 star.  It seems they could have found a better system for resealing than this attractive hazard.  There are zipper openings on similar pouches with re-sealable sticker strips that fold down over a ziplok type closure which could easily prevent a spill and provide for a second serving.  THE CHOKING HAZARD OF THAT HIUGE GREEN BUTTON SEAL IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN.<br /><br />Now, as for who liked it - well, everyone!  Babies of the age mentioned had a blast eating the Pear sauce, since that's what it is really, not noticing anything they shouldn't like because when we served it, I made sure to ask fellow moms not make faces and to just say :"Yummy pears & spinach!" with a smile.  Preschoolers who tried it liked it and for the older kids, we snuck it into home-made yogurt with no other sweetener other than tiny bit of agave syrup drizzle on top for them to stir in along with chopped, chunked pears.  Nobody complained at all; not even the parents eating the yogurt until after I told them what it was.  Then they all claimed they could taste the greens straight away - yeah.. right! NOT!<br /><br />Now,  If you eat the product plain, I admit, the first bite has a bright bloom of broccoli or spinach flavor, depending upon whom you ask, but once you take a second spoonful, you hardly notice at all.  I would eat this mixed into my yogurt for flavoring if only to induce my children to enjoy it even more.  The kids never noticed or cared. It goes to show you how much we pass down our own food prejudices to our kids.  If WE wrinkle our nose at something, so likely will they.  Better to just let them try it in a neutral atmosphere.<br /><br />This leads me to my other reason for wanting to try this -- I have an older relative who has had throat cancer & after several surgeries can now only eat pureed items or those horrid sugary liquid nutritional drinks.  I was hoping to try this out on my relative and see if she would enjoy this as a nice change of pace and she did!  However, she can only manage about 1/2 of the pouch per sitting, which is a recommended serving.  There's really not enough vegetable matter in here to make this a decent regular option over say, juiced kale, spinach and carrot, mixed into homemde yogurt but I gave it the ole college try!  A neighbor who is elderly and insulin dependent took two packages to carry in her purse and told me they were terrific options for correcting too strong a dose of insulin or for preventing a blood sugar crash between meals.<br /><br />Given these positive experiences with older folks,  I think Baby Gourmet might wish to consider branching out and thinking about these specialty markets too.  Diabetics and people with swallowing and/or digestion issues need a good, Organic, BPA -free option just as much as Babies do.  Baby Gourmet already has a winning formula and manufacturing set-up.  Perhpas they'll consider this other merket.  I've written to them about it in hopes they will consider possible other applications for their good , BPA-free foods!<br /><br />While I still am disappointed that there's no appreciable protien or calcium in a baby food advertising itself as a Fruit & Greens Mix, I like the product well enough to want to try their other flavors and to continue buying this one as a good Prepared baby Food Back-up option for when I do not have the time to m ake my own baby food (other than Breast milk!).  I am VERY appreciative of the fact that Baby Gourmet makes a tasty product even adults can enjoy and further, that their label is ACCURATE by weight.<br /><br />As has been pointed out by fellow Vine Program member, Work of Life,  Happy Baby Organic Baby Food isn't quite so honest about their content.  Like  Vine Member, Work To Life, I highly rcommend the following book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470425245">Feeding Baby Green: The Earth Friendly Program for Healthy, Safe Nutrition During Pregnancy, Childhood, and Beyond</a> and I also recommend the follow-up book by the same author, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078799622X">Raising Baby Green: The Earth-Friendly Guide to Pregnancy, Childbirth, and Baby Care</a> to any of you who are striving to raise healthy children in a grocery store amnnd marketing world full of deceptive labels and advertising.

review/summary: delicious and nutritious and perfect for on the go
review/text: Giving a baby a nutritious meal is one of the utmost important responsibilities of being a parent. Doing so on the go is becoming harder and harder in our society, which favors fast food over everything.<br /><br />Baby Gourmet's product is a puree of organic ingredients, without added natural sugars. In fact, the sugar content of each 4.5 pouch container is about 1 gram.<br /><br />This puree is like a green smoothie for your baby - guaranteed to provide energy and nutrition without any allergens. Unlike processed foods and/or yogurt, this product is meat free, dairy free, nut free, gluten free, egg free. The ingredients of this product are an organic pear, an organic broccoli, organic spinach, absorbing acid (vitamin C, most likely to keep freshness), and organic lemon concentrate. That's it. No unnecessary additives.<br /><br />Although feeding homemade food is best, this is a close replacement for homemade nutritious food on the go.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I tried one of these to see what it would taste like before subjecting any babies to it. And what do you know? It was absolutely delicious! It brought back memories of what my mom fed me when I was little - apple sauce purees, purees with pears, purees with plums, etc. Baby Gourmet's product didn't taste overly green, overly purred, or sugary. The texture was smooth.<br /><br />I'd recommend these as the choice for baby food on the go.

review/summary: Great ingredients, bad taste
review/text: I like this baby food because it contains nothing but organic, whole food ingredients.  The packaging is also handy, it comes in a flexible pouch that appears to be space saving.  The packaging is BPA free, however I do not know if it is lined with another type of plastic which may be equally nasty.  I tried the Juicy Pear and Garden Greens - it has broccoli which is a super food, however I would add a small caution because it contains spinach.  Spinach has oxalic acid which depletes calcium, so it is not advised to eat spinach more than once a week.  I see this product as a great, healthy choice if you need a packaged food product for six months or older babies.  I see this product being especially useful when traveling with a baby since it does not need to be refrigerated.<br /><br />Update to review - taste test by three kids:  I taste tested this product with three kids ages 2, 6, and 10.  The two year old immediately spit it out on the floor.  Six year old got the worst pickled prune face at the taste of it and groaned, and the 10 year old shouted "disgusting"!  The verdict?  The taste of this food is pretty bad to children of many ages.

review/summary: My 19 Month old is not a fan
review/text: I am so bummed, as we have 10 of these left, and they are not cheap, but my 19 month old will not eat this flavor.  She happily eats similar purees by HappyBaby, Ella's Kitchen, and Plum Organics, pretty much daily.  She dug into these right when they arrived, but wouldn't finish the first one.  I was surprised, because she rarely turns down a pouch, but since then, she has refused to try it again.<br /><br />I tried it myself, and find this flavor to be more "green" tasting than the other brands.  The others are definitely sweetened more by fruit, where this one leans more toward a grass flavor.  I am guessing that we've trained our little one to prefer the sweet with the other brands, so if this is an early food, it will probably be fine with your little one.<br /><br />At any rate, you can't beat the convenience.  We carry pouches around in my purse, the car and keep a big stash on hand at home.  I feel like these are far healthier snacks, than the raisins and fruit snacks my older two ate on the run.  Considering my 19 month old has been primarily on table food for almost a year, I am shocked that she still loves the pouches so much.<br /><br />She loves the fruit flavors by this brand much more than this one.

review/text: Well, let me start by saying this product smelled pretty good (and that says a lot for baby food as it usually makes me want to wrinkle my nose and say ick!). My baby girl seemed to enjoy the taste and ate a good half of the pouch in one sitting.  I even took a little lick myself and it was surprisingly tasty.  I wasn't thrilled about the opening being on a slant.  My baby enjoys holding these pouches herself to suck out the food and she had a difficult time gripping it properly while getting her mouth around the opening.

review/summary: From the point of view of someone trying it as snack food, seems alright
review/text: Others were kind enough to provide the nutrition info...to me the salient facts are:<br /><br />80 calories per pouch (2 servings x 40 cal), no protein or fat...all carbs 9 g, 2 of which are fiber.<br /><br />No strange ingredients - just pear, broccoli, spinach, vitamin c, and lemon juice concentrate.<br /><br />Made in Canada.<br /><br />On the plus side it does taste alright...kind of a grassy pear flavor, lightly sweet, but not super sugary (which in my mind is a good thing...why condition kids to like a lot of sugar so young?)<br /><br />The cap is nice as it makes it resealable.<br /><br />So I'll admit I don't have a baby...got it because I was curious about using it for a snack (easier than keeping a bunch of veggies at my desk...)  I have to admit, I like the flavor just fine, but the texture is...well...it's baby food.  Which is to say kind of like thick mucus.  I'm sure babies are fine with it.  For me I could add it to a smoothie or something but at that point I'd rather add my own veggies.  Plus it has vitamin c but not a lot in the way of other vitamins or minerals or protein....the food bank was the lucky recipient of the rest of these.<br /><br />I guess for adult snack food it boils down to - taste good, convenient packaging, texture off putting.<br /><br />For babies - not too sweet, very natural, can't comment as to whether this fits dietary needs or not.

review/text: Ok, I admit it. You caught me. I, a grown adult, eat baby food on occasion. Only the fruitier ones, but still. I will insist until my death that it is no different from eating apple sauce. In any case, on to the review!<br />I was a little hesitant at the "garden greens", anticipating some kind of strange, grassy mixture. It was nothing like that though, mostly pear, and naturally sweet.<br />I love these little pouches, they are (sorta) resealable and easy to eat on-the-go. They aren't very substantial, nutritionally, with only 2 gm fiber per pouch. Definitely a better snack than a candy bar though!<br />I can't imagine holding this bag with tiny child hands though. It's squishy and I can see it slipping right out of your little one's fingers.<br />They are great refrigerated, but do not need to be. They come in boxes, in a box, in another box, which seemed a bit unnecessary in terms of packaging.<br />Now I am craving one!

review/summary: toddler wont eat this
review/text: My toddler grandson does not eat too many foods, but will eat some baby food fruits and veggies.  However, this did not go over, and he wants nothing to do with it.  That being said, it is a good product with organic and healthy ingredients, so I didnt want it to go to waste.  I find it helpful to add a spoon or two to his potatoes, and I also make pancakes, adding some of this in place of the liquid.  Both of those methods work.  I think for younger babies starting out, if you introduce this earlier, you will have much better luck.  One other thing, I've seen a few companies try out this packaging, and personally, I don't like it.  I find it hard to squeeze out all of the food, and can be messy.  It's ok for travel, but otherwise, I wish they would just stick to the glass jar.

review/text: Baby Gourmet Juicy Pear & Garden Greens is quite tasty. I make green smoothies all the time that taste similar, but this is a little sweeter.  The packaging is very convenient for travel or emergencies. One package is 4.5 oz (128g) which is suppose to be 2 servings of 40 calories each. Per serving, there is no fat, sodium or protein and 9 carbs, 2 of which are fiber.  However, the label says % Daily Value: 2% protein, 25% of Vit A, 70% Vit C, Calcium 0% and Iron 2%. I'm assuming that is per serving. It is gluten free.  I'd certainly keep the cap away from baby, but it is very large and has slots in it.

review/summary: Never let them see you sweat
review/text: I'm always trying to find ways to get vegetables into the small children without causing a standoff at the O.K. Corral.<br /><br />Luckily, mine have become enchanted with snacks that come in squeeze packets, especially the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E0S4UW">GoGo Squeez Applesauce on the Go</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E0S4YI">GoGo SqueeZ AppleBanana, Applesauce on the Go</a>.  I thought I would slip pear sauce into the mix without them noticing.<br /><br />Unfortunately one of them can read and he read it and pointed out the words garden greens to his little brother and sister.  Then he pointed out the picture of broccoli on the front.  Both of them looked up at me with their sad eyes that said, "Why, why would you sneak broccoli into our snack drawer?  Why?"<br /><br />Never let them see you sweat.<br /><br />"You try it!" "No!" "No!" "No!"<br /><br />So I tried it and I tried really hard not to make a face.  I tried really hard to think of it as 2g fiber in 40 calories.<br /><br />It doesn't taste like pears, exactly, but neither does it taste like broccoli.  It kind of reminded me of eating a pear salad on a small table while sitting in a sidewalk caf&eacute; and drinking a tall cool glass of ice tea.  Pureed, though, pureed.

review/summary: Pouches are *not* recyclable, *not* earth-friendly
review/text: Baby Gourmet has a good idea here - organic food makes mommy feel good about what she's giving her baby, and at the same time it tastes good for the baby.  This particular variety, Juicy Pear & Garden Greens, does taste good as far as baby food goes.  You taste the pear more than the green (which tasted mostly like broccoli to me), and you certainly don't smell the green (odor goes a long way with mommies, especially if it gags you to spoon it into the baby's mouth!)<br /><br />My biggest problem with this food is not the food itself, it is the packaging.  "Organic" implies that the food is not just healthier for your (or your baby's) body, it also suggests that it is better for the earth itself because there were no chemicals used & therefore no pollution to the earth caused by growing the food.  It is hypocritical to then produce the food in packaging that simply has to be thrown away because it has no recycling options whatsoever.  The packaging for this food is completely unrecyclable, as far as I can figure out.<br /><br />The cap, although hard plastic like many other food containers, has no recycle symbol on it and therefore cannot be recycled in most recycling programs.  The actual food pouch is just like a juice pouch, which also cannot be recycled in curbside recycling programs - the best some juice companies have done so far is ask you to clean the pouches and turn them in to be repurposed (or make crafts with them yourself).  The plastic spout on this pouch makes it even harder to do something like that, and the truth is most people don't repurpose, they just throw it out when there are no recycling options.<br /><br />While it is convenient, the packaging leaves much to be desired, and would lead me to purchase one of the other organic baby food options out there just because I could then recycle the container when I'm through.

review/text: My wife and I are L-O-N-G past the baby- rearing years. Our son is grown and gone.<br />So I found a family member to give this to.She was very appreciative.<br />She told us that "the kid" (my fault , don't remember names well) really enjoyed this product. "The happy face" was in motion during feeding time. I guess I will have to (gladly) take her word for it.

review/summary: Take it or leave it
review/text: I received this from the Vine Program and tested it on my 3 month old granddaughter. There were times when she would spit it out and other times she would take it with a grain of salt. Honestly, her opinions were mixed and we really couldn't tell if she actually liked it or not. So for this one, I'll say, she'll take it or leave it. I'm interested in knowing other's opinions and experiences.

review/summary: The obvious hole in BPA-Free product claims
review/text: This Baby Gourmet baby food claims that it is BPA Plastics-Free and Organic. They make these claims boldly and prominently. And thus it is fair to critically examine them and their motives and products and claims and prior corporate history when rating these premium products. I guess we could have reasonable faith in the two features, USDA Organic and BPA-Free, even though we really wouldn't know anything about how these foods are grown, manufactured or packaged unless we were experts and had accurate data on the entire production chains. However, there is still an obvious major hole in BPA-Free product claims today. Many alternative news and safety organizations/groups claim that plastics manufacturers and food companies knew for decades that BPA was highly dangerous for humans, and yet they still chose to go ahead using it for food either through willful negligence and greed, or outright intent to poison the American population (for various conspiracy theories/realities). If that's true, and it certainly could be--since the same companies now are conceding that BPA could be dangerous--then the big obvious hole in the story now is that all these same companies are NOT certifying that the CURRENT plastics and substances they use for packaging and processing are not dangerous and harmful, to the best of their knowledge. Anotherwords, they eliminated the BPA, but the same potential problems could remain, dangerous impurities and toxic substances, and the manufacturers have included no promise, guarantee or certification on their products that they promise and certify they are telling the truth that they know of no potential likely dangers in the current new generation materials and processes. Therefore, the only logical conclusion to draw, based on past behavior, is that these companies and corporations cannot be trusted, you have no reasonable expectation that they can ever be trusted, or will ever deserve to be, and therefore any use of products for babies mass-manufactured by Anyone, let alone major food companies and corporations, or any profit-seeking entity, whose only agenda is profit, should not and must not be trusted or relied upon, and you proceed in using them at your own (your children's) risk. (And, even if they did do such certification, as we have learned in the past 20 years, the certifications of governments, corporations, companies, and indeed most NGO's/think tank's/activists/and lobbyists are worth about as much as the paper they're printed on.)

review/summary: Organic, Lie
review/text: ***<br /><br />I ordered these bags of baby food in the expectation that a baby I personally know, seven-month-old Julius, would just pretty much lap them up, which would save his parents a fair amount on their food budget.  As it turns out, as the result of a long series of carefully measured, double-blind observations involving a large experimental sample size and of course a large control group, it has been ruled out that any explanation other than a constitutional aversion to spinach causes Julius to vomit.  Shortly after Julius eats spinach, he vomits.  Not just mostly but every single time.<br /><br />And I don't mean regular vomiting.  I mean what's called projectile vomiting, which you can look up, in which the vomitus can be exprelled WITHOUT WARNING at astonsihingly high rates of speed considering they're coming from a seven-month-old baby who can barely sit up yet without help.  Julius has ejected vomitus as far away as 10 feet at first burst, which is pretty impressive and a little dangerous if you happen to be leaning over him at the moment.<br /><br />As it turns out, his parents and the other people who take care of him DO have a preference whether Julius eats spinach.  Not surprisingly, they do NOT like it when their baby unexpectedly and at skin-stinging velocity pukes in their faces.  You might call them selfish to deprive him of spinach, but I don't.<br /><br />This product contains spinach in every bite, er, squoosh, so I am unable to test it in the field, on the ground, in real time going forward.  I can say that the fact no one fed Julius this product several times has saved exactly that many episodes of his unwanted projectile vomiting.  For this I add 1 star.<br /><br />However, I also did offer some of the Juicy Pear & Garden Greens version to my dog, PheyeG'hdeaux, and he refused after the first taste.  And this is a dog that will happily eat cat poop and long-dead squirrels.  For this I subtract 1 star, so we're back to 5.<br /><br />NOT A CHOKING HAZARD<br /><br />Up to a certain age, infants instinctively try not only to put things in their mouths but also to swallow them without regard to whether they are swallowable or even tasty.  Few seven-year-olds would try to swallow half a pair of dice, but Julius, at one-twelfth that age, isn't yet that smart.  If he tries to swallow an object of the wrong size and shape, it will get caught in his throat in such a way that his trachea, his breathing tube, is obstructed.  Julius will eventually exhibit gross symptoms of his respiratory distress -- his inability to breathe -- but that won't matter if no adult is looking.  If enough time goes by his brain will suffer anoxia, if enough more time goes by some of the neurons as well as other cells in that brain will perish, and if enough more time goes by Julius will be rendered unconcsious, and if the ultimate amount of time goes by he will die of asphyxiation.<br /><br />So it's important that the cap for this product not be swallowable by anyone with tastes as undiscriminating and survival instincts as undeveloped as seven-month old Julius's.  If it were the cap to the valve stem of the left front tire of your car, that would be one thing, or any of the other four tires, because the likelihood that cap will be reachable by your version of Julius is so low.  But the likelihood the cap to a pouch of baby food will be reachable by an infant is much higher.  The manufacturer has chosen a design for the cap that makes it all but impossible for Julius to swallow it or otherwise be harmed by it.  In fact, you may safely dip this cap in honey and dust it with sugar and hand it to him and walk away.  Or her.<br /><br />First, it's way too big for even an adult to swallow.  I took the opportunity of being in the same room with a pouch of this product and the family's well-known big-mouth.  I asked her to determine whether she could swallow it, and after explaining my reason I watched as she tried really hard for ten seconds or so and deemed it "Not possible."  The collar at its widest measures 1.257 inches.  The height is 0.628 inches, which as you probably know is equal to 0.009373 smoots.<br /><br />Second, the collar that surrounds the threaded part is mostly air, i.e., except for these four thin ribs or vanes, the collar is floating outside the threaded part, which means if the infant does manage to get it wedged at the top of the trachea where it enters the mouth, not only can air still pass through but any of the baby food itself can pass through.<br /><br />NOT NOT ORGANIC<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is a product that's referred to as organic.  The main ingredients -- pear, broccoli and spinach -- are "organic," and it contains no preservatives unless you count ascorbic acid and organic lemon juice.  The problem, of course, is that without preservatives the product is more likely to spoil, to go bad.  And going on the assumption that foods labelled organic are more expensive to get from soil to spoon, the price of this product is surely higher than it would be otherwise.  For its being organic I subtract 1 star.<br /><br />EXTRA TESTING<br /><br />-- The goop, while it might be perfectly healthful for a baby, is a perfectly dreadful substitute for taco sauce, salad dressing, or the Alfredo sauce on a Parmesan-besprinkled bed of liguine.  Trust me.<br /><br />-- You might be wondering how well the goop inside, which does taste like pear and even kind of has the grit of pear, works as a substitute for, say, floor-tile mastic.  I laid four one-foot linoleum tiles in a quarter-inch bed of Baby Gourmet 1 Simple Purees 6 Months+ Organic Juicy Pear & Garden Greens, 4.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12) and waited a whole 24 hours, at the end of which time the tiles were not even remotely well-stuck to the subfloor but did attract a LOT of ants, so many that we needed the services of a professional exterminator, for which we will be suing Baby Gourmet for an amount in excess of $25,000.<br /><br />-- When you fire a Marlin .22 caliber rifle at the pouch from ten yards away, the bullet passes through quite readily and embeds itself in the right door of the 2012 Hyundai Sonata that is parked in the driveway of your neighbor three houses west, who will start out incredulous and end up irate.<br /><br />For these defects I subtract no stars, I just thought you should know.<br /><br />PRODUCT DESCRIPTION<br /><br />Finally, the Product Description on Amazon is comical.  It starts this way:<br /><br />"We think every mom has a morbid fear of feeding their babies vegetables . . ."  First, I find it sad that whoever wrote this decicded to say "their babies" when it should have been "her babies."  One thing we know for sure about anyone who's a mom is that that person is a female, so the excessive political correctness of not using the gender-specific pronoun here is also comical.<br /><br />But second, and more important, I find it incredible that the people at Baby Gourmet really believe "every mom has a morbid fear" of feeding vegetables to her baby.  Not just some moms, not just many moms, not even most moms, but EVERY mom.  That's just stupidly wrong.  And it's even wronger when you remember that it's a MORBID fear, one that is on a par with fearing death itself.  Whoever wrote this is telling us that the people at Baby Gourmet sincerely do believe that EVERY mom has a MORBID fear of feeding vegetables to her baby.  This is insultingly false, and it gives you permission to question everything else they say.  This is an example of offering for sale a solution to a problem that doesn't exist till the marketers create it.<br /><br />Also, I have to point out that the description goes on to say "thus we have made a blend of Organic Pears, Organic Broccoli and Organic Spinach that taste well, out of this world actually!"<br /><br />For the comical mistakes in the Product Description I subtract no stars.  For the outrageous lie I subtract 1.<br /><br />Five stars plus 1 minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 am 3.<br /><br />***

review/summary: Healthy but my toddler daughter did not finish it.
review/text: I know this is advertised for 6 months on but I figured since my toddler daughter (20 months) eats other snacks out of a pouch. I would give this a try.<br /><br />This food is high quality and very handy to give to a baby.  My daughter and did eat most of the food from the pouch, but did not finish it.  She is actually very good about trying new things, but if she does not love the new food, she stops eating it.  Since she ate most of it and it is of very high quality, I would rate it highly, but not a five star rating for an older baby.  I think most babies start liking sweeter food as they become toddlers and their food experiences broaden.  This food is not sweet, due to its high quality and nutritional value, and would probably be excellent for a sitter stage baby.  I was hoping my toddler daughter would like it, but she was not too fond of it.  Of course each child will have his or her own likes and dislikes in foods.  If you want a high quality, nutritional food that is easy to store and serve, then do try this.

review/summary: Great snack; but too broccoli tasting for kids
review/text: My son (who is five) and I eat these types of things a lot for snacks.  They are especially handy while hiking or camping since they don't require refrigeration.<br /><br />This puree has mainly pears and broccoli in it.  I enjoyed eating them as a snack, but my son didn't enjoy the strong broccoli after taste.<br /><br />This is comparable to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031U9UDY">Ella's Kitchen Organic Baby Food Broccoli, Pears + Peas (4+months), 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 7)</a>; they taste very similar and the packaging works in a similar way.<br /><br />All in all I thought these were tasty and enjoy eating them for snacks.  My son did not like the taste though; he thought the broccoli after taste was horrible.  These are great for when you want to bring fruits and veggies that are portable and non-perishable.

review/summary: mostly tastes like pears
review/text: I think this is a very healthy baby food that tastes great too.  It mostly tastes like pears, but there is that hint of spinach and broccoli that comes as an aftertaste.  Of course, the taste of pears is probably the most appetizing of the three so that is a good thing.  It tastes great warm or cold too.<br /><br />Although the packaging is a little different than other brands we usually get (glass jars or plastic cups), it works well.  The spout is good for pouring some into another container with no mess.

review/summary: Gourmet, Organic Food Choices for New and Old Babies
review/text: The younger generations are all about being healthy and using natural products, which I suppose is good. So I am not surprised at all that moms in today's world are interested in organic, natural products for their babies and toddlers.<br /><br />One of the leaders in producing organic baby foods is Baby Gourmet, an Edmonton, Canada, company founded by Jennifer Broe with the help of her sister, Jill Vos. Their organic food products come in a slim pouch that allows mom or dad to easily squeeze the food onto a spoon. When baby grows into a toddler he or she will be able to feed themselves straight from the package with ease.<br /><br />All of their foods are organic with no thickeners or fillers, no added sugar or salt, are Kosher in BPA-free re-sealable packaging, and carry USDA, FDA and organic certification.<br /><br />For my nephew I choose the organic juicy pear and garden greens choice for 6 months-plus (Stage 1) which also is gluten free, nut free, with no dairy, egg or lactose. The box contains six 4 �-ounce pouches. Other choices for 6 months-plus include: Orchard Apple, Carrot and Prune; Simply Sweet Potatoes; Sweet Potato, Apple and Chicken; and Harvest Pear, Pumpkin and Banana.<br /><br />I didn't want to take away from my nephew's enjoyment so did not taste the pears or greens but he downed the whole package without complaint. And it its OK with him than I can certainly recommended it to you.

review/summary: 1 Pouch = 2 Servings.....Kids Love Them!!!!
review/text: The very first time my grandkids, ages 16 months & 2 1/2 yrs., tried Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Juicy Pear & Garden Greens Pouches, they asked for seconds. At that time, I didn't realize that one pouch is actually 2 servings. They each had 4 servings that day! A couple days later my grandson wanted another helping of spinach tortellini but I decided to give him one of these pouches instead. He looked at me with a huge smile & said, "I love these things!"<br /><br />Curiosity got the best of me so I sampled the puree. It's not watery & holds its shape on a spoon.<br />Surprisingly, I could taste the broccoli/greens & the pears.<br /><br />These are not only great for meals, but can be used as a take-along snack.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, ascorbic acid, organic lemon juice concentrate<br /><br />no artificial ingredients, no added sugar, no thickeners/fillers, no added salt, gluten free, kosher; USDA, FDA, and organic certification<br /><br />Edited to add that 4 servings a day caused the 16 month old to have messy blowouts in her diaper.  I think most Mom's will know what I'm talking about. This was discovered because both kids love these so much that we gave them a pouch for snacktime too. 4 servings a day of the Juicy Pear & Garden Greens proved to be too much for the 16 month old, but the 2 1/2 year old didn't have any problems.<br /><br />5 stars

review/summary: Cool packaging concept...but is this really a necessary product?
review/text: I hate to get up on a soapbox here, but I didn't feed my daughter baby food.  When she was very young, I gave her whatever fruits and vegetables I was having in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056JCY">mesh feeder</a>, and I ground up meats in a simple, hand-cranked baby-food grinder.  That didn't last long before I just cut up everything (soft, of course) in very small pieces, and then there was no looking back.  I would regard prepackaged baby food as only a fallback item.<br /><br />But if you need or wish to use prepackaged baby food for any reason (hey, no judgment here!), Baby Gourmet is as good as any, but at over $2 for a 1/2-cup container, it seems way overpriced to me.  I do like the convenience of the foil package with the integrated feeding straw.  This particular variety tastes like pear ground up with grass (i.e., not good at all), but it's a good idea to mix fruit with vegetables, so I'm not really complaining about it.  I just don't find anything to particularly recommend about the taste.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nicely packaged, quality product that most mothers won't need often (if ever), but, depending on your situation, it may have a place in your life (if you really want and/or need to use baby food and you don't mind paying a ridiculous price).  You could certainly do worse.

review/summary: Tasty for greens, nice container!
review/text: For clarification, all of the enclosed pouches are a MIXTURE of juicy pear and garden greens. I was confused until after I received them.  Now, on to the review!<br /><br />Flavor: really tastes like solely pear. You can barely taste the greens mixed in, which is perfect, since babies love the fruit flavors. Even to myself, it's not bad!<br /><br />Consistency: NOT watery like some other annoying 1st stage foods, but still nice and smooth and runny ENOUGH that it's still good for some of their first foods. This was a huge plus for me... so many of the "1st stage" ones are practically impossible to feed because they spill so easily.<br /><br />Package: A+ for this one. I hated having glass jars for baby food, plus you have a tendency to spoon out of them and then the food goes bad quicker.  In this one, you just squeeze it out  into your bowl, and since there is no contamination, it lasts longer. Yes, I know, I know, they still say to toss after 24 hours, but that, quite frankly, is ridiculous.  Yes, if you have just put a spoon with saliva into your food, then I would too, but that's not the case with these new & neat pouches!  The drawback is that you have to have a bowl, which is not as convenient if you are out and about. But I mix most of the baby food with oatmeal anyway, so it was a benefit for me.<br /><br />So overall, I definitely recommend!

review/summary: I've had 2
review/text: I tried this myself before offering it to the baby.  My initial reaction was that it tasted unusual.  Not bad, just unusual.  The "unusual" flavor was quickly replaced with the sweet aftertaste of pear.  Mmmm... that was actually pretty good.  I had some more.  Yup, unusual... mmmmmm pear.  I wound up eating the whole thing.<br /><br />I was running late the other morning and didn't have time for breakfast.  I saw this sitting in the cupboard and thought, "What the heck" and slurped it down on my way out the door.  Mmmmm pear!  It was about as filling as a Pop-tart but much, MUCH healthier and at least as good.  That's what I love most about this, I think--everything in this package is organic and there are no sweeteners or anything like that, so it's a good, healthy meal.<br /><br />Recommended (especially if you have a baby).

It's sweet and a little sour (just a little), and babies love this stuff.  Particularly for veggies, this is a great idea for getting babies familiar with this kind of food.  It pleased the one who eating some now.  It's easy to dispense and the package is very easy to carry.<br /><br />The ingredients list is refreshing.  No preservatives or dyes.  The sweetness is natural, too.<br /><br />The pouches can be twist shut after you open, which is handy if you're on the go and your baby only needs a little food.  The portions can last two meals per pouch, depending on your baby.<br /><br />I think this is a great product, but it's on the expensive side, so in my opinion is a four star value.

review/summary: Great as a secret add in!
review/text: I know, it's baby food and I don't have small babies in the house. I do have younger children, picky eater younger children! This food was absolutely perfect for the reason I used it - to slip it into the foods my picky eaters will actually eat to give them more nutrition. Oh yes - it is slightly sweet, but it blends oh so well into everything! Spaghetti sauce, ketchup for dipping fries, BBQ sauce for dipping nuggets, salad dressing over a bed of greens, pancake and waffle batter, and even into smoothies! Yes, the taste was mild enough to even it get into oatmeal and cream of wheat with not a peep for the little ones.<br />So, for those with babies - I can't see a baby turning this down. And - even when your baby outgrows the "puree" stage - keep buying this! When your 3, 4, or 5 year old goes through the picky stage this is a great way to sneak some additional nutrients into their diet.<br />Some baby foods have a smell that turns non-babies off and this one didn't have that at all. I could handle the taste and smell easily. This means they were a good add in to my own milk kefir and mocha smoothies. Definitely recommend and will definitely buy in the future!<br />Ingredients: Organic Pear, Organic Broccoli, Organic Spinach, Ascorbic Acid, Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate.<br />Expiration date was approximately 4 1/2 months after delivery, so didn't have to be used right away, but not long enough to be forgotten about on a shelf.

review/summary: Stage One Treat
review/text: As a 'Stage One' food, meant for 6 months old babies, this serves its purpose - introduce the baby to new food textures and to tastes other than milk. It's a time when babies continue to receive most of their nourishment from milk but they are now taught to accept and eventually enjoy some variety.<br /><br />It shouldn't come as a surprise that the product contains no protein, it's meant to be that way. Everything else appears to be clean and well balanced, the taste mild enough to ensure acceptance from the baby and everything, according to the makers, coming from an organic source. At 40 calories per serving (2 servings per pouch) it will not make a baby fat unless the baby was fed a couple of pouches per feeding session.<br /><br />We found the packaging to be convenient because the little bags are easy to store and to dispose but not everyone may 'get' squeezable pouches.<br /><br />Contents (for brevity, I will not write 'organic' before each of the ingredients but the maker claims they are so):<br /><br />- Pear<br />- Broccoli<br />- Spinach<br />- Lemon juice concentrate<br /><br />Also, Ascorbic Acid (source of vitamin C)<br /><br />Other features - things that it does not have:<br /><br />- no fillers or thickeners<br />- no salt or sugars<br />- no dairy, egg or lactose<br />- no gluten<br />- no nuts<br /><br />I can't see how you can go wrong with this. It's worth trying giving it to a 6 months old baby. If the baby rejects it, you can still try again a couple of weeks later. Our test subject seems to enjoy the treat.<br /><br />______________________________________<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />And... yes, the cap and the pouch itself are potential chocking hazards but, so is just about anything else in the house so make sure that the little one is not given the opportunity to try to swallow either.

review/summary: No mess, easy reuse, great for on the run
review/text: There are a couple of different aspects of this product.  The first being the food itself.  Simple, organic, healthy, as much as it can be anyways and still be shelf stable.  The expiration dates seem to be short, which is reassuring that there are not many additives in it, however you might want to keep your eye on it.<br /><br />The packaging is the other aspect of this.  Since you can easily squeeze it out on to a spoon without touching the spoon, you can easily seal this up and use it again without worrying about bacteria from your child's mouth.  The alternative is the kid could just eat the food directly, which is great if the kid can do it and is going to eat it all anyways.  This makes it great for on the go.<br /><br />I don't think there are many downsides, unless your child doesn't like the greens mixed with the pear, since it does make the taste a bit strange (at least to my adult palette).

review/text: Baby food is one of those things I have been around a lot, I helped raise my little brother and I have a lot of friends with babies, so used and tasted a lot of baby foods, from Gerber to Beachnut, and various organic brands.<br /><br />So this one, is a little different, at least in its packaging.  I like the pouch in that it is easy to squeeze out in to a bowl and then store away, and I think its more travel friendly then say, carrying a glass jar, but in terms of the taste, it taste just about the same, to me, as any other baby food, it still taste like stale cook fruits and vegetables, but that's not a bad thing, since pretty much all pre-made baby food is that way.  I would say, if you are going to get this baby food, its main attracting factor is the packaging, and not the food itself, though it being organic is a plus.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy

review/summary: Really impressed!
review/text: I try to make as much of my own baby food as possible. Sometimes I can't do that, so I substitute with jars. I am a die-hard Earth's Best fan, but was open to trying something new.<br /><br />I have to say that I am really impressed with this baby food. It is certified organic and comes in a variety of tasty flavors that my 8-month old daughter loves. I was worried about the plastic packaging, but was glad to see it is BPA-free. The packaging is also very user-friendly; it's easy to open, easy to close, and easy to store.<br /><br />I still like the fact that Earth's Best comes in glass jars, but I will definitely try more flavors of this baby food in the future.

review/summary: Probably loved by babies...
review/text: The short version:  These would probably be fine and palatable to a baby/toddler.  If you are looking for food for an older kid with eating issues/food aversions/texture issues etc... they are smooth as regular apple sauce, but the flavor made my son spit it out.  I thought they tasted good, but I'm not the one with the food aversions (or at least not the same ones)...  My son did eat plenty of green veggies as an infant that he won't touch now (even if pureed), so your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Our family regularly consumes more of these baby food "pouches" and fruit sauce "pouches" than I imagine most families who have an actual baby at the suggested "stage".  My son has autism and has quite a few issues with eating so not only does something have to taste good, it has to be uniform in consistency, and it has to look and smell acceptable to him.  He is 8 and he will eat baby food puree (Earth's best in the little glass jars) that doesn't have any "gummable" chunks that older babies usually get.  Add in that we have G6PD Deficiency and follow strict dietary rules and there are few "convenience" foods that are suited to our needs...<br />My son adores the Revolution Foods pouches but will not touch home-made apple sauce (even if hidden in reused baby food jars)... Some of the Ella's Kitchen pouches he adores and others he hated so much that he will go through the entire fridge shelf of pouches just to make sure none of those flavors have infiltrated...<br /><br />I was hoping that this Baby Gourmet Simple Puree Juicy Pear and Garden Greens pouch would be a great way to get some Broccoli and other green goodies in his belly.  They do have some added ascorbic acid, which is contraindicated in high doses for folks with G6PD deficiency, but I calculated the potential dose and for us (your mileage may vary and you should consult your pediatrician or hematologist about ascorbic acid and any other contraindicated substances) it was ok.  My spouse joined us in the pouch taste test.<br /><br />I think they taste good- like pear-apple sauce with a hint of broccoli/greens.  It kind of reminded me of when my mom would serve us pork chops and potatoes, apple sauce, and spinach for dinner when I was a kid (sans the pork chops).... My husband thought they were just as good as any of the other ones we have tried.<br /><br />My kid took two slurps of it and ran to the toilet to spit it out.  He declared that it tastes like the apple sauce went bad.  I disagree, but as far as what purees come into our house, his opinion is very important.  I think that if I diluted one of these with two regular apple sauces it might "dampen" the loudness of the veggies enough for him to eat it but I'm not even sure about that.  To me the green flavors weren't that "loud" but they definitely made this "not pearsauce/applesauce blend"...  Definitely not a "sneaky chef" sort of food for our family, but I'll probably try other flavors out as they are still an extra little boost of goodness for adults on the run.

review/summary: Only GREEN food he eats!
review/text: Great source of nutrition.  LOVE the packaging: easy to dispense, does not make messes when opened!  Our test baby (adorable baby Caleb, aged 5 months) LOVED it, I think he would eat every meal, I think.  He liked it after many failed attempts with other brands with ANY green vegetable.  This child may be pre-programmed for picky eating (as BOTH parents are terribly picky eaters) and yet he truly loved this.  This kiddo can eat a whole package in one sitting---and asks for more!  A total hit!  TRY IT!!!!!!

review/summary: Our twins love it.
review/text: We have 9 month old twins and our babies love this baby gourmet juicy pear and garden greens.  That's the true test, if your baby eats it!  Ours eat it every time.  It looks green and a bit odd but they gobble it up.  There is nothing funky on the ingredients list that cause us concern either.  Overall we are very happy with this organic baby food and are babies are happy with it as well!

review/summary: Good, Wholesome Food for Your Infant Child
review/text: Going organic is all the rage and organic versions of our favorite foods continue to appear in places we may not expect. One is baby food and one brand to offer the organic seal of approval is Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1. Intended for babies age 6 months and younger, this food offers infants the same natural food goodness that adults have been enjoying thanks to the organic/green movement.<br /><br />This baby food is loaded with vitamins for an infant's good health and well- being. The product is kosher and the packaging is BPA free. These are all good qualities for a baby food and they are befitting a product promoted as organic and natural.<br /><br />But what about the taste? If a baby won't eat the food, then it makes no difference how healthy it is. Thankfully, babies do like this food. They eat it just as quickly as they do their other food and they have no problem finishing a full package, which isn't necessarily all that large. The texture is smooth and the digestion appears to be easy.<br /><br />One potential issue some may have with this baby food is its expiration. The expiration date is about five to six months in the future and I assume it is due to the all- natural, preservative free composition. This is a much shorter time frame than that of most canned baby foods, so you have to be careful not to purchase so much that your baby cannot consume it before the expiration date.<br /><br />Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1 is, overall, a very good quality baby food with wholesome ingredients and good nutrition. The cost of about three dollars per container is a tad much, but this is a product of quality and most would agree that price is worth it for the good health of their infant family members.
