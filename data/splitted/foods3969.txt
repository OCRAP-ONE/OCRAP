review/summary: Sparkling Ice Black Raspberry
review/text: I have to say, this drink is probably my 2nd favorite of the Sparkling Ice line-up (the first being the Coconut-Pineapple) and it is very delicious.  As a away to quit drinking soda, I've been looking into healthier alternatives, and the Sparkling Ice brand is one of the brands I've found to try out.  And I've enjoyed almost all of them.<br /><br />Black Raspberry tastes exactly like black raspberries.  It's a little bit sweet, and has that tangy raspberry in the sun flavor.  And the aftertaste is just the same as the original taste so you don't have to worry about a shock of sour or other weird flavor.  It also has carbonation so you get that pleasant fizzy feeling on your tongue while drinking that makes soda so popular.  One bottle is pretty large too, 17 ounces, and I've found that it will get me through most of the morning at work, although it stops being cold after awhile, but hey, it even tastes decent warm.<br /><br />The ingredients are pretty good too.  With the exception of the sweetener being sucralose, which I'm not crazy about, they have green tea extracts, actual raspberry flavors, and spring water listed.  And the list is short compared to a lot of drinks out there.  It may not be the healthiest, but it's not as bad as soda either.  And it's still 0 calories, which for a flavored drink is pretty good.  They also put in a few vitamins to the mix, such as B3 and a some other B vitamins so you can pretend you're drinking something healthy as a result of that as well.<br /><br />I will keep buying these drinks as a soda replacement.  They're reasonably priced and taste good and make the no-caffeine transition easier.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: I was introduced to this beverage by a family member. Being a person who has to watch their sugar intake, I was delighted to discover this beverage and even more excited to find in on Amazon. It has a light refreshing taste and it does not taste overly sweet like other diet drinks. The beverage also has a lighter carbonation then soda pop.  Additionally, this beverage  contains vitamins and Green Tea. There are several flavors available, but my personal favorite is the Black Raspberry. I just ordered another case of the Black Raspberry and a case of the Pineapple. I cannot wait to try the Pineapple.

It was so refreshing, with just the right amount of fizz and the perfect amount of calories: ZERO.  My local grocer could not keep it on the shelves because of its popularity, so I went to Amazon and found that I could have my Sparkling Ice delivered to my doorstep every month and at a cost that was cheaper than what the grocer charged.  Win - Win!  Sparkling Ice is offered in many flavors which are just as tasty but I got hooked on the Black Raspberry.  Try it and you'll be hooked too.

review/summary: Good with one big flaw
review/text: I used to be a big fan of the Sparkling Ice drinks.  They taste pretty good, made me feel good and were all natural - or so I thought.  Although their target audience seems to be healthy, active adults, which is why it's a naturally flavored vitamin drink, they use artificial colors in all their drinks.  To me, that's the big flaw.  I've decided to stop drinking Sparkling Ice and start drinking other naturally flavored vita-waters that are also naturally colored.  I hope that Sparkling Ice will someday make its drink "all natural" so that I can start drinking it again.

review/summary: Packing didnt work out
review/text: Packing is a fail.  2 bottles out of my 12 were busted cracks along the bottom of the two broken.  I'm not sure if they just got roughed up and broke or if they froze somehow.  Nothing frozen on delivery.  They don't appear cut though.  Looks like there is no way to recover the loss no return options.  The drinks that did not break taste great and all.  But without me seeing away to get credit or anything other than taking a loss this wont be worth trying again.<br /><br />The package was the 12 bottles shrink wrapped then tied in an industrial type garbage bag and then placed in a box that was a good deal larger than the bottles with no packing material.  The bag worked for stopping the liquid from leaking into the box.  Out of the four beverages I ordered from amazon this was the only one with broken containers and the only one packaged in this fashion.  Its as if it was packed to fail but also packed well enough to contain the liquid from ruining the rest of the package and containing the surprise for me!

review/text: I grew up in Indiana eating black raspberries.  They are my favorite fruit in the whole universe!  I moved down to the Atlanta, GA area two years ago, and no one here seems to have any idea what a black raspberry is.  My daughter came home very excited and couldn't wait to tell me what she had found -- TalkingRain Sparkling ICE Black Raspberry drink!  We were both so excited we could harly stand it.<br /><br />We bought some and couldn't wait to drink it...  MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!  This is NOT black raspberry -- it's a mixture of red raspberry and black berries.  That was a dirty trick!  :(<br /><br />So sad.<br /><br />Yes, the drink is very yummy, but it tastes NOTHING like black raspberries.

review/summary: way too sweet....
review/text: I found this drink to be somewhat refreshing. As one reviewer remarked, however, this does not provide a true black raspberry flavoring. I'd say that it more closely resembles a blackberry, boysenberry, or black currant flavor. In any case, it's fairly quenching. If it weren't so sickly sweet, I probably could've given it four stars.

The 20 ounce bags are about the same price or a little less than the grocery price ... and then there's the free shipping too. Can't go wrong with this offering. The local Fred Meyer sold this item (and the organic SB alternative) for $5 less per bag a few weeks ago, but I can't get them anymore locally, so Amazon it is.<br /><br />These larger bags are great for travel -- I take along a French press coffee pot and anywhere I can get boiled water I can have a nice cup of fresh and steamy French Roast, no electricity needed. French roasted coffee is dark, rich, fragrant, and robust -- all with less acidity than most other coffees, and it is good for your liver too, but most of all, "yum".

review/text: Starbucks French Roast is one of my favorite for its bold and distinctive flavor. It is a dark roast and works best if you desire bold or strong coffee. I have tried many other "french roast" blends but can taste the huge difference in this one that leaves others lacking. As much as I love it, it is impossibly expensive coffee. I used to buy it from Amazon and Amazon itself used to carry the 2 20-ounce bags for under half of what it is now selling for. The closest thing I have found is a Starbucks roasted sold from Costco in their own brand. That is a solidly good coffee and great price if you can buy it in the store. I wish Amazon would again carry this coffee for the price I was used to. It was great.

review/text: I just have to agree with everyone else that Fazer chocolate is simply the best in the world. And talk about being skeptical about it. The first one I had was from my sister  and it had ginger bread, cherries and almonds in it. And I thought "What's with gingerbread and cherries in chocolate?"  I thought it was going to be sickening. I could however understand the almond part. Anyway, after a few skeptical bites I was sunk. I now find it hard to be satisfied with any other chocolate in the world, except Fazer. And to this day I am amazed by that since I used to love all chocolate. In a way, I wish I wouldn't have ever had it, since all other chocolate seems lacking now. I was finally able to try the dark chocolate and it's just as delicious as the milk chocolate. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

review/summary: What all other milk chocolates want to be when they grow up
review/text: Beware - you will love this chocolate.  Not for someone on a diet, because you will not want to stop eating it and before you know it will have polished off the entire almost 1/2 pound "bar" of the best plain milk chocolate in the world.  Let it warm in your mouth to soften ... and ... enjoy the bliss.

review/text: Fazer chocolate is excellent chocolate...but hard to find. So, I was thrilled to find these bars on Amazon. However, when I received the chocolate, it seemed like it had been sitting on the shelf for a while, and the expiration date was only 6 weeks away from when I received my order, which was frustrating.

review/text: I bought this to put into korean ramen noodles for some texture. I looked around and it really is hard to find this product for a reasonable price. Even the price on amazon seems high. The picture does not do much justice for how much you actually get. One packet lasted me atleast 3-4 months.<br />Lotus Root stops diarrhea, clears Heat and improves appetite. Lotus roots contains iron, vitamins B & C. The rich fibre content of lotus roots stimulates peristalsis and relieves constipation.

review/text: For years I have loved the "Reeses Pieces sundae" that is served at the Friendly's restaurants. However, the price of that sundae has risen sharply through the years. I've always wanted to make this sundae at home, but finding the peanut butter topping that Friendly's used has been the issue. I finally located this peanut butter sauce which is excellent. I am on my third jar of the sauce, and actually purchased two jars this time. Just remember to thoroughly stir the sauce before using, as the oil migrates to the top of the jar and the sauce thickens on the bottom. And enjoy!!!

Perhaps the secret is the cider vinegar; whatever it is, it pairs perfectly with any green or vegetable salad.  (It's dynamite on a Greek salad of tomato, cucumber, onion, and feta cheese).  A little goes a long way, which keeps the calorie count lighter, too.  I have used it as a chicken marinade--scrumptious.

review/text: When I first popped the candy into my mouth, I seem to be able to taste honey, even before the liquid honey center flows out. Looking at the ingredients; there are sugar, corn syrup, honey, vitamin b6, b12 and C. It does not list the percentage of sugar versus corn syrup versus honey. The distinguishable factor is the liquid honey center. But how much of that is pure honey I do not know and can only ponder.  To me, it is just another candy.

review/text: I've liked Honees for a long time, but rarely see them in gas stations or grocery stores.<br /><br />These 'energy' Honees supposedly have B/C vitamins in them to give you an energy boost. I'm not sure I noticed a real boost in my pep when I had these, but I'd still buy them anyway if I saw them in the store. Why?<br /><br />Because I like honey, and Honees have actual honey in them. They're both richer and mellower than almost any other candies you'll see at the grocery store or gas station. I find the flavor soothing and more enjoyable.  With their honey content, you could also treat them as cough drops.<br /><br />If you're looking for an interesting and unusually flavored candy, check these out! You can get energy/vitamins from them too, but I wouldn't buy them on that alone since you should be getting your B and C vitamins from fruits and vegetables already anyway.

review/summary: Just because a food has the word "Energy" in its name doesn't mean you'll get an energy boost...
review/text: I received a sample of this candy through the vine program. I chose it because it had the word "Energy" in the title, and there are some times when I feel like I could use a boost. Those times are not frequent, mind you, but it's nice to have something on hand when you want it. The first night I tried this candy was on Halloween, as I escorted my children through the surrounding neighborhoods with some other parents. I popped on of these in my mouth, as did another parent I had offered it to. We both thought the taste was good (if you like honey, you'll like these, for sure, as that's all you can taste), but neither of us felt any sort of energy boost as we spent a few hours walking around. My wife tried one the next day (thought it was a bit too sweet) and said she felt a slight energy boost. I had another one the next day and offered one to a co-worker, who accepted. As before, neither of us felt any noticeable bump in out energy levels. Maybe the energy boost is psychosomatic? You WANT to feel it, so some people decide they DO feel it? I don't know. For me, it just boiled down to this being a good-tasting candy that had slightly more dietary value than most candies. Would I buy it in the store? Probably not.

review/text: I've used honey cough drops in the past and was pleased with how soothing they were and these too were pleasant to use.  One of the main differences is these contain some key vitamins, plus after using it for a while, the honey will burst out of the shell and surprise you with a coating of honey.  This fun part could entice kids to use these too and get the benefits of the vitamins and honey, which can be very helpful to soothe a sore throat on the go.  Individually wrapped, these are handy throw in your bag and found that the wrapping is sufficiently easy to unwrap, especially since other similar products can be hard to unwrap without getting fingers sticky.

review/summary: Treat it as the best tasting cough drop out there
review/text: I have been on something of honey jag this year.  It seems to find it's way into everything around me from baked goods to bath products.  Honey is better for you than the vast majority what it there.  (I discovered, just a day or 2 ago, when perusing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012">On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a> that it is not quite what I had believed to be (being composed primarily of glucose & sucrose: sugar).  It is, however, natural and at this point in time that means a lot!  Honees have been around a long long time and are still being made with natural ingredients.  Most of the product is honey and sugar (not high fructose corn syrup or artificial flavoring).  The Honees "energy bar" is basically the same as Honees candies but with the addition of vitamin B10, B12 and Vitamin C.  I have another honey candy on subscription now, in large part because I like them ;) but stocked up before my kids went back to school and started bringing home the usual colds and flus.  They made a great cough drop, are very soothing, and mildly antibiotic.  So, the addition of B & C vitamins was a good idea.  It gives this an extra boost for fighting off coughs, sore throats.  Unfortunately there is not enough information in the description or on the package to know how much in the way of vitamins it supplies (relative to the US RDA).  I would not treat this as a vitamin, or vitamin substitute, and have no idea where the "energy" comes from, other than the sugar (though that is the #1 source of energy for both plants and animals ;)  )<br /><br />I gave this product 4 stars only because having comapared them, I still prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4JEXS">Cedrinca Miele Honey Candies, 5.25-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>  Both of these candies are basically honey wrapped in a sugar shell.  The Cederinca has proportionately more honey, less sugar, which has much to do with my preference.  If you have a sore throat, cold, etc. the Honees might have a slight edge because of the vitamins, but that said, I suspect there  is not much (and they are not making any claims as a nutritional substitute, which is nice to see).  In fact, just days after these arrived, my son came home with a sore throat, so they are being put to use (though I did manage to nab a few for myself).<br /><br />Wholesome natural candies with a little extra,  recommended as a (comparatively) healthy treat or for dry or sore throat, cough... (note I am recommending them, not the manufacturer.  I do not want to mislead people).  On the whole these are better tasting and better for you than the average candy, or cough drop (but I am still going to keep my subscription to Cenrinca).  Which you prefer depends on your relative preference for honey or sugar.  The Honess have a thicker sugar shell, the Cedrinca have more honey.

Turns out this is a jolly rancher sized and textured candy with the only difference being a soft/chewy center filled with honey.  Very sweet, to the point of making me want to drink.  Otherwise pretty good.<br /><br />I do not at all believe it boosted my energy, however.  Let's face it, it's supplemented with easily attainable water soluble vitamins that are excreted when in excess, which means that if you eat like a normal person and/or take a vitamin pill, this will do nothing for you but give you a boost of sugar and for a little while, at that.

The upshot is that they don't taste at all medicinal, either.  For the Vitamin B content they contain, I was expecting these to have some bitter aftertaste, or at least be less tasty. Liquid B vitamins are ATROCIOUS, but these were quite pleasant. I give them 4 out of 5 stars only because they claim to give a boost of energy, which I have not noticed. If you're getting these based on that claim, you may be disappointed. Having said that, I take B vitamin complex, B6, and B12 every day, so I may have a higher threshold for the "energy" those vitamins typically provide.  Overall, an enjoyable little drop!

review/summary: Really Just Candy...
review/text: The Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Honey flavored drops are really just another candy. The touted vitamins B6, B12 & C are in such small amounts that it takes three 20 calorie candies to get 100% of the recommended daily requirement.<br /><br />The candies are reasonably flavorful and the liquid honey center is interesting though reached too soon. They're not overly sweet and the honey flavor a nice change of pace. The ingredients are: Sugar, Corn Syrup, Honey and the Vitamins. There appear to be no preservatives or artificial flavor enhancements. Each package contains (9) drops and weighs 1.58 ounces. These candies are manufactured in Italy.<br /><br />One word of warning; After being in your mouth for a while these become incredibly sticky. If you wear dentures or have bad teeth caution should be exercised while consuming.<br /><br />I felt no energy boost from the B6 & B12 vitamins even after eating several of these candies. The addition of B6, B12 and C appear to just be a hook to draw in the health conscious. In the end, this is just another candy product and nothing more.

review/text: For all practical purposes this is a hard candy filled with some honey. The first 3 listed ingredients are Sugar, Corn Syrup and Honey. How much "energy" that would provide at 20 calories per lozenge is arguable. It does however taste fine -  a distinct (as to be expected) honey flavor!

The way I see it, if you are going to consume something, you might as well enjoy it. Ambrosoli-HoneeEnergy Plus more than fills the bill. I found it to be very soothing, but also had a strong honey flavor that I absolutely LOVED!<br /><br />The very best review I can offer for this product: I am about to order it again, and will be back for more.

review/summary: A Nice Boost, but not instant
review/text: When I looked at this product, I was anticipating a candy equivalent to Red Bull. I did not find myself getting an energy boost from these, certainly nothing compared to a Coke. However, for 20 calories, this is a tasty way to up your vitamin  B and C levels, which helps both with mood and with immunity.<br /><br />If you're looking for an energy boost, these candies probably aren't it. But if you're looking for a candy treat that does more than rotting your teeth, having one of these a couple times a day is a tasty option.

review/summary: Honey Fans Gather 'Round
review/text: I like honey, preferably in small doses, and Ambrosoli Honees' Energy Plus Vitamin Honey Drops fits the bill.  After allowing one of these drops to dissolve in my mouth for just a few minutes, I was given a small punch of pure honey from the center of the drop.  The taste was very good and just sweet enough to satisfy.  Being real honey, just know that if any of the outer candy coating is still in your mouth, the honey will adhere it to whatever tooth happens to be closest!<br /><br />These drops claim to give you a bit of energy as well, but I found myself wanting in the "energy" department.  Each drop contains about a third of the daily recommended amounts of Vitamins C, B6, and B12, which means you would have to consume three of these drops in order to get the full "energy" effect.  With only nine pieces per pack, though, you're really only getting three "energy" servings as compared to the nine servings listed on the package.<br /><br />If you enjoy the taste of honey and like a little touch of it every now and then, these Amrosoli Honees Energy Plus drops are perfect.  If you want a boost of energy, however, you might want to chase your honey drops with a Monster, Red Bull, or Rockstar.<br /><br />Recommended only for taste.

review/summary: Nice energy kick on a short run!
review/text: I love energy gels, chews, powders, etc. I sometimes take them even when I don't need to, just because I like them that much.  Being an "endurance athlete", I have conditioned myself to not run, ride or swim w/o some sort of fast acting carb source and fluids along for the trip.  I popped one of these before my lunch run last week and took off.  I was pleasantly surprised to feel a nice steady energy level for the entire 40 minutes.<br /><br />The good:<br />Quick uptake of simple starches (read SUGAR) for energy.<br />The liquid honey center tastes like....honey.<br /><br />The bad:<br />It's mostly sugar.  I expected to crash from it at some point, but ironically, never did.<br />The liquid honey center tastes like....honey.  Yes, I put that as good and bad.  It was cool at first, then made me want to vom.  Too sweet for my tastes.<br />After you've had it in your mouth for awhile you crunch it up into a sticky, unchewable, knifelike projection that you end up spitting out anyway for fear of stabbing your tongue or choking on it during bouts of heavy breathing.

review/text: I love the taste of these candies. They have a hard outer shell that tastes like a butter toffee and a liquid honey center. I wanted to try one in the afternoon when I was really dragging at the end of a work day (4:30 - 5:00 is when my energy seems to be at its lowest). While I really enjoyed eating the lozenge, I didn't notice any burst or spark of energy. Nothing compared to a cup of coffee or tea. I did only eat one and not three consecutively, so maybe if I had eaten more I would have felt the charge. My grandchildren all loved them and hey, there's nothing wrong with candy that contains some vitamins. I didn't have a sore throat, but I bet they would be soothing because of the honey and vitamins. I would order these again; not for the energy aspect but the delightful taste.

review/summary: A honey-filled candy square with vitamins. Taste good.
review/text: Ambrosoli-Honees EnergyPlus honey-filled drops. A honey-flavored hard candy  rectangles on the outside, with a small honey filled center. Overall, they taste good - a honey candy. My 8 year old son has taken a true liking to these candies and I've gotten to like them too.<br /><br />Ingredients are: Sugar, corn syrup, honey, vitamin B6, vitamin b12, and vitamin C. Each caffeine-free drop is 5 carbs, 0 fiber, 5 sugars, and 20 calories. Serving size is 1, but 3 drops are needed to get the 100% DV of vitamins B6, B12, and C.<br /><br />EnergyPlus tastes good - there's no doubt to that. They have good ingredients like honey and vitamins, but also contain not -so-good ingredients like sugar and corn syrup. These drops are likely good for on-the-go activities or to soothe a mildly sore throat.

review/summary: Individually Wrapped Drops with a Sweet Taste
review/text: The packages as shown contain 9 individually wrapped drops that look like cough drops. The list of ingredients includes sugar, corn syrup, honey, trace amounts of vitamin A and vitamins B6-0.66mg, B12-2mg, and C-20mg each at what is claimed to be 33% of the recommended daily dosage; three drops providing then the listed minimum requirement. The drops contain no protein, no sodium, no fat, and no fiber<br /><br />The amounts of vitamins C and B6 are so minimal as to be hardly worth mentioning; the amount of B12 is phenomenal if their information is correct. The DV for vitamin B12 is 2.4 mcg daily and the label claims 2mg or 2,000 mcg per drop or 6mg or 6,000 mcg with three drops. I suspect there's a typo there and it should read 2mcg, not 2mg since B12 is usually measured in mcg.<br /><br />In summary the drops are small and convenient, but expensive. If the B12 value is correct it has huge quantities of that B vitamin; other than that the cost is hard to justify.

review/summary: Great for raspy coughs!
review/text: The packaging for this says it is an "Energy" + "Vitamin" drop, and according to the ingredients, that is correct.  However, after eating my entire package (over two days) I can't say that I have experienced any sudden bursts of energy; but I can say that the drops worked very well for me as a cough drop.  First, the flavor of the hard "shell" tastes exactly like natural honey, not the "honey flavor/menthol" flavor of some honey drops.  After allowing the drop to melt in your mouth there is a center of thick, pure, tasty honey inside.  These drops taste great, and they calmed my scratchy, allergy induced, cough faster (and with a better taste) than the usual "medicine tasting" cough drops). 3 drops contain 100% of your daily allowance of Vitamins C, B6, and B12, so hopefully with continued use I will see an increase in energy due to the B vitamins.

review/summary: Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Honey Drops
review/text: Ok, I have to admit I was a little intrigued by the concept of this candy.  Well sorta candy, I'm not sure what you would classify this product as.  It claimed to give you energy and it was made of honey, that's actually pretty neat and healthy sounding.  That being said, there were a few things that just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />The drop is basically a hard candy coating wrapped around liquid honey, or what I'm assuming is the honey in the product.  This honey has a very sweet medicinal taste to it and the outside coating is exactly like a hard candy.  Right down to the stick on your teeth and be impossible to get off aspect.  The inside did taste better than the outside coating and had a lot richer flavor to it.  But alas, that sensation didn't last very long as there wasn't very much in there.<br /><br />I didn't experience any uplift in energy at all from this product.  But I did find it good as a sort of cough drop.  It definitely eased my coughing back when I had a cold.  This product also dissolved pretty well into hot tea to help soothe the throat that way too.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed with the ingredients lift.  Corn syrup was featured pretty prominently with honey coming in listed after that.  So there wasn't as much honey as there could have been in this product.  But it also had some vitamins thrown in and the ingredient list wasn't that large.  So it came out ok all in all.<br /><br />I don't see myself getting this product too much unless I'm sick.  Its ok but nothing I would go out of my way for.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011

Calories are 20 per piece; most ingredients hold negligible nutritious content, although Vitamins C, B6 and B12 each provide 33% DV.<br /><br />Nice to have in purse or backpack for a hungry moment or oral fix.

I noticed no energy boost even after consuming three.<br /><br />They claim to contain vitamins, which is great, but they don't really contain that much.  For the price difference, I would prefer to stick with the original flavor and get my vitamins elsewhere.

That's exactly what it tases like, - fresh honey.<br />I like the fact that each drop contains 1/3rd the daily value of vitamins B6, B12, and vitamin C.<br />The benefit of 'brain food' is something you don't normally get in a candy.<br /><br />There are 9 peices in each packet, one box contains 24 packets.<br />That's 216 peices at the current price of $27.69 = 12.81 cents each drop.<br />That figure seems quite a reasonable amount for a candy that's for the most part healthy.<br /><br />After using one pack of 9 peices I can't say I noticed any energy 'boost',<br />but this product is certainly worth using in place of junk candy,<br />which will leave you with a very noticeable energy 'low'.<br /><br />This candy deserves 5 stars for it's taste and healthful properties.<br />In other words, 5 stars for NOT CONTAINING --<br />Saturated Fat, Trans Fat, Omg, and Sodium.<br /><br />The one point I wonder about is, this candy is made in, and imported from Italy.<br />For those who use honey regularly you likely already know that,<br />studies have shown that honey harvested the closest to where you live is more suited to nourish your body.<br /><br />Having said that, I still feel it's a great little snack, and a pretty good cough drop too!

review/summary: Delectable but devious
review/text: These Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Honey candies were two thirds of a disappointment.<br /><br />The product as described on the packaging and as described on Amazon makes three claims, and only one of them met my expectations.<br /><br />1. One claim is that it will in some way make you more energetic.  The fact "ENERGY PLUS" is by far the hugest lettering on the package, almost to the exclusion of everything else, is one example.  The manufacturer's use of the phrase "Instant Honey Energy," whatever that means, is another example.<br /><br />2. Another claim is that the product contains three particular vitamins.<br /><br />3. And a third, implied, claim is that these candies are pleasurable to eat.<br /><br />Let's examine those three claims in reverse order.<br /><br />3. These candies are pleasurable to eat, at least compared to, say, a multi-vitamin.  They are sweet, of course, and there is a distinct flavor of honey on the outside as well as in the more liquid center.<br /><br />You should be aware that after enjoying three or even one of these candies your teeth will be covered in a sticky, tacky, gummy substance, which will be even more of a problem if you have dentures or a partial plate.<br /><br />2. The product does contain three vitamins as claimed, those being B6 (pyridoxal phosphate), B12 (cobalamin) and C (ascorbic acid).<br /><br />I ran a sample of one of these candies through a 1996-vintage mass spectrometer I have in my basement, and all three of the named vitamins are present as advertised.  But you probably wouldn't want to use these candies as a substitute for a simple multi-vitamin.  The generic Wal-Mart knockoff of Centrum Silver, for example, offers significantly more of these three vitamins than one of these candies, although it doesn't taste nearly as good.  Note that the packaging says you get 100% (presumably of the Recommended Daily Allowance, or RDA) of these three vitamins only if you consume three of them.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br />-------- 1 Multi-vitamin --- 1 candy --- 3 candies<br />=====================================<br />B6 -------------- 3 mg ---- 2/3 mg ------- 2 mg<br />B12 -----------25 mcg ----- 2 mcg ------ 6 mcg<br />C ------------- 60 mg ----- 20 mg ------- 60 mg<br />------------------------------------------------<br /><br />More important, of course, is that a multi-vitamin supplies maybe thirty other vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />Which is not to say you should substitute a multi-vitamin or any number of these candies for a healthful diet, which will contain all the Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12 you need.<br /><br />Anyway, the point is that the fact three of these candies supply 100% of the RDA of three particular vitamins should be of no consequence in your decision whether to buy the product.<br /><br />1. I don't understand the various versions of the first claim, which is that the product somehow supplies special energy to your body.<br /><br />Remember "ENERGY PLUS" and "Instant Honey Energy"?<br /><br />First, and this is purely subjective, I never noticed any increase in my energy even after consuming as many as five of these candies at once, so you can imagine how little an increase in energy I noticed after only one.<br /><br />Second, trying to be more objective, it isn't clear to me which ingredients of this product are even supposed to increase my energy.  The three most prominent ingredients are sugar (which is, well, sugar) and corn syrup (which is sugar) and honey (which is sugar).  To the extent the sugar in these candies increases energy, so does any other product containing the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />Third, if all you want is a jolt of energy, drink a cup of coffee or some other substance containing caffeine.  Caffeine indisputably makes most humans noticeably more "energetic" till it wears off, as do certain other not-necessarily-legal substances, not that I would know from personal, subjective experience, mind you, it's just what I've read and stuff.<br /><br />For the questionable advertising, trying to trick us into buying a product we might not buy if we knew all the truth, I subtract two stars.  If you're looking for an instant burst of energy or a vitamin supplement, this is a poor choice.<br /><br />If you're looking for a honey-flavored candy, this ain't bad at all as long as you remember to brush your teeth afterwards.

You have to swallow three drops (yes, count them... three drops) just to get 100% of your daily value of the B & C Vitamins. So yes, technically the vitamins are there, just not in the quantities that you would be led to believe by the front of the package.<br /><br />Finally, Does this item give you energy? - No not really, not at all! At only 20 calories per drop and most of that from sugar, corn syrup and honey it gives you about as much energy as a regular hard mint candy. The vitamins are dosed in negligible amounts to really make any kind of difference. I ate six drops at once and no energy boost at all.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want a honey-candy product this is for you.  If you are looking for an energy boost, keep looking because this product just doesn't pack all the goods that it promises in the title.

review/summary: Basically honey flavored candy
review/text: Many people feel a "boost" from vitamin B - hence the energy boost claim. I felt no extra energy, but they are a good craving kicker.  I kept a pack in the car and was driving around - was in a hurry, skipped breakfast. Had a few of these and they took the edge off.  The description calls this a "bar" - it's not a bar - it's a pack of a dozen or so individually wrapped pieces. Each piece tastes like and resembles a hard candy shell with a gooey honey filling. Tastes like honey - I like sweet, and these are very sweet.<br /><br />I can see these for a carb-fix while on the trail or even skiing, as an alternative to a granola bar for example. For taste and as a treat - perfect. For energy? Not so much.

review/summary: Would not recommend
review/text: When a product has honey or vitamins in the title or description, people automatically think healthy.  These are not healthy at all and do not provide any extra energy.  They are full of high fructose corn syrup. It is easier and healthier to eat a spoonful of raw honey or take vitamins in pill form. Will not be buying or recommending to anyone.

review/summary: The small energy bar
review/text: I got one small energy bar instead of a whole box,I just don't understand what's 'pack of 24' mean?<br />But I should say the flavor is okay.

review/summary: Yep, it's honey-candy
review/text: These are individually wrapped hard candies with a gooey (not exactly liquid, but soft) center. They're about the size of a Jolly Rancher. The outside tastes pretty much exactly like honey. The inside also tastes like honey, but with a softer texture. If you're the impatient sort that likes to chew your soft-centered hard candies, get ready to enjoy a very, very sticky coating of honey on your teeth for a while.<br /><br />I didn't notice much energy. I mean, they're pretty small candies, so the sugar involved is not enough to offer much of a perk, and the vitamins didn't do anything noticeable for me, but I already take supplements. Still, if you're looking for a sweet little pick-me-up while working, this might help. Note that the candies don't have any caffeine, like I often expect from something claiming to give "energy." :)

review/summary: Honey is third ingredient in list
review/text: Ingredients list:<br />Sugar, Corn syrup, Honey, vit b6, vit B12, vit C.<br />1 piece = 20 cals.<br /><br />Packaging:  Easy to open and pop a treat in your mouth.  The hard candy shell keeps things neat and is easy to pop out of the wrapper.<br />Taste:  Pretty good, the outer shell is a like a sweet hard candy, then when you get to the middle, the honey flavor really comes out.<br />Claims:  The energy boost you get is probably just a boost of sugar, rapid up and down.  The vits you can get from a well balanced meal or a real supplement<br />Overall:  Just think of this as honey candy, ignore the the fluffy stuff.

review/summary: Great way to eat before a short workout
review/text: I have found that these are a great way to eat something before a morning workout. I'll eat one or two before I run and fortunately they do not upset my stomach. The outside is a hard, candy-like shell and on the inside is honey. I wouldn't recommend as a primary source of energy for workouts longer than say an hour because it wouldn't be enough to sustain you, but in the morning when you need "something" this seems to do the trick for me.<br /><br />My only complaint is that if I were to take these on a bike ride, they would be too difficult to open while riding, not to mention the fact that the shell is hard and I prefer a soft shell when I'm eating while exercising.

review/summary: Tasty enough, but not fabulous either
review/text: I enjoyed the Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Caramel energy thingies (could they please come up with a longer name?), but I probably wouldn't buy them.  While they do contain vitamins, I'd prefer to just take a vitamin.  I didn't feel particularly energized either, although again they're reasonably enjoyable.<br /><br />They're not great and not bad.  If you like honey, you might like these.  I can't really see a great demand for these, but I'm sure someone will love them.  I prefer the non-carmel version to the carmel Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin things.

review/summary: Honey Lover's Lozenge
review/text: Pretty tasty, not really mediciney or gross at all, plus a nice kick of multivitamins. Dissolved a couple in hot tea and that wasn't bad either. Not quite Ricola with echinacea, but not bad! Individual wrappers were a little hard to get off.

review/summary: VERY Honey Tasting and Good!
review/text: The wrapper says, "Energy Plus Honey Filled Drops"......do they actually give the recipient 'Energy Plus'?  I don't have a clue! What I do know is that they tasted good and when I received the package I had a sore throat and by the time I had finished the package it felt much better, which might have been a result of the honey and the sweet, soothing taste of the product.<br /><br />I think it is a bit expensive to gobble down like candy such as I did and it would be much more practical to carry it in a car or handbag for an occasional pick-me-up, but however you choose to eat it, it tastes great!<br /><br />I loved the hard shell and then the liquid center!

review/summary: Nice candy, not a health food or energy snack
review/text: Conceptually, this is a great idea and is likely spawned from the popularity of gummy vitamins. I really liked the flavor of the candy. The honey center was amazing.<br />My big beef with this product is twofold: 1) Where's the energy boost? 2) Where's the vitamin goodness?<br /><br />These candies don't contain any substance known to boost your energy in the dose included in the candy. This seems misleading to me. Nor does the claim of vitamins really stack up. It takes ~2.5 candies to get your daily vitamin requirements, and that's just for B and C vitamins. What about all the other vitamins you may need? Well you're on your own. On top of this, this candy is loaded in corn syrup...yuck!<br /><br />I can't completely dislike this product, because they are delicious. I'd just recommend you treat them like the candy they are.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: These things are virtually tasteless; sorta sugar with a slight honey aftertaste. Nothing I'd choose to snack on. So far as energy goes, I felt absolutely nothing, even after taking two of them (I subsequently threw the rest of them out). The ingredients are sugar, corn syrup, honey, vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin C, in that order, so I doubt they can be horribly good for you either. Granted you could take three per day and get your recommended allowance of the three vitamins (for 60 calories), but why would you want to? Definitely not something I'd ever buy again.

review/summary: honey candy
review/text: This product is marketed not as a candy but as a vitamin and energy booster. In reality it is a honey candy; it's first two ingredients are sugar and corn syrup. Three drops equal 100% of daily requirement of B6, B12, and C (at 20 calories each). And I suppose the B vitamins are what warrants the energy boost ( I noticed no such effect).<br /><br />As it is honey, the packaging was pretty sticky and a couple drops had to be discarded because I could not peel the plastic wrapper off the drop.<br /><br />The take home message is that  if you like honey then this is good candy for you. If you are looking for vitamins and energy, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Taste Okay
review/text: These Honey Flavored Hard Pieces tasted okay if you like honey. Actually, I used them when I had a sore throat and thought the honey filled center soothed my throat for a time. But, as far as giving any energy goes, I noticed no difference in my energy level anytime I took one. In fact once I ate two in a row, and still no difference. I think they should repackage them for sore throats :)

review/summary: Taste great - no energy boost though...
review/text: I tried these and they taste great. They are a honey flavored hard candy that claims to have B vitamins for a boost of energy. I never felt a boost of energy, but I had to restrain myself from eating a whole pack at a time for fear that I might overdose on B vitamins. I have never gotten B12 shots, but I have friends who swear by them. These candies did not give me anything like the boost they claim to get from the shots. I think that I preferred the honey candies over the caramel slightly, but both are good.
