review/summary: Dainty but delish
review/text: The steaks were dainty but delish. I know you are supposed to eat between three to four ounces of beef as a healthy portion size, but sometimes you like to splurge and eat a bit more. If that's the case, I'd suggest purchasing a package with larger steaks. The four ounce steaks made up for their daintiness by being marvelously flavorful and tender. So tender you don't need a steak knife to cut them up for eating. The flavor was pretty good, as sirloin steaks go, but for good beefy flavor try a rib eye instead.<br /><br />Recommend.

review/summary: Nice plant, but deceiving picture!
review/text: I was excited when I saw the picture of this plant and the price.  Even with shipping being a lot more than the cost of the plant itself, the overall price I thought was still a steal.  Then the plant showed up today.  Yes, it's the same kind of plant but it looks like a little baby version.  Nowhere near as big and full as the picture.  It's EXTREMELY misleading.  I would have given this one star for being so misleading instead of two, but if I hold onto the plant long enough and take care of it, someday it may look o.k.  It's a nice plant for $4.95, but I would not have paid this plus shipping to get a plant this small if I had known.<br /><br />Update - I reread the information in the plant description, and it does say the plant delivered is not pictured, so I apparantly missed that.  However, it is kind of buried and still slightly deceiving.  Very nice plant though and I found a great pot for it - just don't expect anything huge to start with.

review/summary: Finally -- peace within the pack!
review/text: I have 3 70 pound retriever mixes and they always have to have something in their mouths.  Unfortunately, it is usually one of their fellow pack-mates that they wind up chewing on and the 3 of them get to scrapping like a scrum in a rugby game.  Not very restful.<br /><br />However, with 3 of the large Everlasting Treat balls stuffed with these treats, I'm good for a couple of relatively peaceful evenings.  Depending on the dog and the ball, the treats usually stay in there and will one two-pack will last a couple of nights.  Occasionally, the treat will "pop out" of the ball and the lucky dog will be able to chew it up in about the same amount of time as a raw-hide chip.<br /><br />I like that these aren't raw-hide since raw-hide will sometimes cause digestive issues in my dogs (and there is nothing worse when 3 big dogs have digestive issues!).<br /><br />I'm so glad to see Amazon sell these because my local Petsmart no longer carries them -- at least not in the size that I need.  Plus, Amazon saves me a trip, shipping, and tax... happiness abounds for bi-peds and quadra-peds alike!

review/summary: Everlast treats
review/text: My dogs loved this treat. They would lick it and lick it. But after a couple of days my Corgi's which are very smart dogs, figured out how to get it out. Even after the treat was gone they would lick the plastic like crazy. There are new everlast locking treats out that are suppose to stop your dog from popping out the treat. I would try the locking system first since the balls are not cheap to replace.

They keep the dogs busy for a long time and they love them.  The only thing I'll say is that if you have more than one dog be sure to have one for each dog otherwise the typical jealousy among dogs occurs.

review/summary: good idea but not for my dog
review/text: Bought for 1 year old Maltese~I like the idea of the treat ball and thought this would be a neat one b/c the treat sticks out of the ball but the dog still has to work to eat the treat. I inserted the treats into the sides of the ball and within half an hour my dog managed to pry the treat out of the ball and then chewed and swallowed the remaining treat. I was afraid she would choke so that was the first and last time she played with this toy.

review/summary: Everlast? I think not!
review/text: I've heard that this type of treat is very good. Dogs seem to like it and it seems to last a long time. Other than it seeming to taste good, it didn't even last 10 minutes! I have a labradane. She loves treats which doesnt help the fact people says it may or may not taste good. Other than that, this product stinks. I bought it a few days ago and it finally arrived today. I put my puppy in her crate and handed her one of these treats to keep her busy while I pack. This treat was GONE in less than 10 minutes. G.O.N.E gone! Now, its not like my puppy is an aggressive chewer, she just has a strong jaw. She's also a puppy, for those people reading this who have ever had a puppy, they are easily distracted by food.<br />I looked up dog treats for aggressive chewers/strong jawed dogs and this was one of the first 5 items that appeared.I read reviews on it and everyone was crazy about how it was soo good. Now to find that I'm not finished packing, I have to go fill up her KONG to keep her from crying as she sees me running in and out of the room. I do not recommend this unless your dog is old or isnt very interested in dog treats/bones and would rather lay next to you...

review/text: These are something my dogs love, and when I first purchased them and the container they are put in, they would last a long time.  I do not know if the holder is weaker or if one of my dogs just has figured out how to remove them now.  One dog still naws slowly on them, but the other dog somehow gets them out and eats them quickly.  I wanted to have something for them to naw at while I was away and keep them busy, but now the one dogs just pops them out and gobbles them up.  Still give them to my dogs as they like them.

I have a German Shepherd and an Australian Cattle dog that just never want to stop playing...in the house....and they are very loud!  If I want to watch a movie or something like that and I have one of these to put in my everlasting treat ball, I am very happy!  It lasts for a long time for my cattle dog but for the German Shepherd it doesn't last as long.  He can chew up most bones in under 10 minutes and this actually takes him more like 30 minutes to eat the whole thing, both sides and all.  So to me the price is worth it and I think it's a great product, the dogs LOVE it.

With the puppy especially and all the growing she's doing (she's already about 80 lbs. and will get up to about 135 lbs.), she is very healthy without any fat on her, has high energy and her coat is shiny and beautiful.  Both dogs love this food and I never have turned up noses like I sometimes do with other dog foods.  I also like the fact that the food is all made in America without fear of poisons from other countries.

With other teas, I always had to worry about adding a few drops of lemon juice or milk to cut the tannin taste but with Lemon Lift, none of that is necessary. It provides the caffeine kick I need, tastes great, and requires minimum effort to prepare. Each tea bag comes hermetically sealed so there is no danger that it will degrade with time. Buy the six pack with 20 tea bags per box, and always have it on hand at home and at work when you need it. A box makes a great present for your tea-drinking friends as well.<br />Enjoy!

review/text: If you like the taste of lemon, and you like tea, you'll probably like Bigelow's Lemon Lift blend. The tea is of good quality, sold for a reasonable price, and kept fresh by Bigelow's signature foil-wrapped packets. The lemon flavoring in Lemon Lift isn't quite as good as fresh-squeezed lemon, but it's certainly easier!

review/summary: Great Tea. Need better price.
review/text: This tea is my all time favorite. I drink it every day. If you like lemon and cinnnamon but with a real black tea boldness not a sissy herbal sense then you will love this tea.<br /><br />I was happy to find it in bulk on amazon because I keep running out. This first time I bought it I thought it was a good deal because of the free shipping. But as I have looked into it again it is actually priced more than my local food store so there is no real advantage to buying it here.

review/summary: Classic Seattle Tea
review/text: As a classic Seattle tea, this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea. When I drink this tea, I am home again. This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup.<br /><br />This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors. You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree or the RIEME French vanilla syrup.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I've been thinking about rose water sodas that I had as a child when my mother took me to the local middle eastern restaurant.  So of course I searched Amazon!  This was not the most expensive version offered but when I got it, it was all that I remembered.  Mix the syrup and club soda to taste and drink. You can even make a cocktail by just adding vodka to the mix. It tastes just like roses smell.  There are receipes on line for rose cookies and cakes that you can make with this syrup as well.  I can't wait to try.

review/text: I love getting rose tea at one of my local restaurants but was getting tired of the price for each one so I asked them how they made it.  They said that they used rose syrup so I ordered this one and I could not be happier with the taste and flavor.  It is great in tea, sparkling water, vodka or anything else you can imagine.  It has a very light but sweet taste so you do not need a lot of it.<br /><br />I ordered mine from Beverage Gourmet and realized that the shipping costs where high but I added a couple more items to my order that I use and it made the shipping very reasonable. However, I would even pay the total shipping on just this because it is worth it.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: That's the best way to describe it.  You pop it in your mouth, and the sensation is similar to chewing on beef jerky, only much better.  The flavor starts to come through very quickly - creamy and aromatic.<br /><br />It's certainly the easiest way to get the full mango flavor experience without the mess.  The quality is consistent - you don't get the odd funny-tasting piece like you do with other dried fruits.<br /><br />This is a terrific snack.  The chewiness makes each bite last, and the flavor just keeps coming.  You can easily make a single serving size last 5 minutes, and there aren't many snack foods that can match that!

review/summary: SULPHERED!
review/text: I am posting this because unfortunately Amazon does not show the label, ingredients on many items.  Since you can not see it, many would assume that this is just dried fruit.  It is not.  It is fruit dried with sulpher.  For some this may not be an issue (but you should know that it is there nonetheless).  I have developed sulphur allergies over the years (you develop allergies via exposure) and with more and more mass produced bulk items containing sulphur, likely many more people will too.  I have had some pretty serious health consequences of same.<br />We can get these locally very inexpensively (I am in Hawaii) and would never purchase this particular brand because of the sulphur.  I did buy it once without thinking, and they tasted bitter, acrid, nowhere near as good as we get in local shops, health food stores.  I realize that tropical fruit is not easy to get everywhere, but there are good healthy alternatives.  Consider, for example: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN5O3C">Woodstock Farms Mango Slices, Unsulphured, 8.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a><br />i was browsing here, hoping to get better prices (and access) on bulk dried fruit, but can see that the lack of labeling info is going to cause me a problem :(  I guess my only alternative until other customers specify what is on the label, is to buy things specifically labeled "unsulphured".<br />If you do not have allergiews or sulphur related health problems (yet) maybe consider comparing the 2.  Sulphured fruit is bitter, leaves a chemical aftertaste and is overdried making it taste a lot less fresh (which it generally is) and tougher.  In my experience, this particular product is the worst offender (at least that I have encountered).  It is heavvily sulphured and really tastes off.

As soon as you pop one in your mouth you get a creamy sensation of the wonderful sweetened mango flavor.  With only 3 ingredients you know exactly what you are eating! You won't be able to eat just one.  This is becoming one of my new favorite "munchie snacks"

review/summary: What a treat. Tastes great, no mess, no noise,  goes anywhere.
review/text: Last month a friend brought me back a package of  dried mangoes from the Phillipines. I stared it for a week or so before opening it, not sure it would be to my taste.  But it was, and then some.  Yum.  Was delighted to discover I could get more of the same here on Amazon. (Well not exactly  the same, but both this brand and the one my friend brought back were from Cebu.) Makes a great between-meals nibble.  No bad fats. No cholesterol. Lots of Vitamin C. Also a first-rate take-along snack, as the pieces are dry and chewy but not sticky or staining or drippy at all. Nothing gets on your fingers.  Nothing noisy to annoy the moviegoers sitting next to you. No wrappers or residue that need throwing away.<br /><br />If anybody reading this knows another brand sold here on Amazon that has all the virtues mentioned above but is a little less sweet,  I'd be most grateful if you'd add a comment directing me to that brand.  Till then, this is my  ball-game, road-trip, woods-walk & between-meals  nibble of choice.  Highly recommended.

And as the sugar hits your body, it's almost a sensory overload.  This product first caught my eye when my mother bought a bag.  She made the mistake of leaving it in the kitchen.

review/text: These are delicious, end of story.  The worst thing I can say is that they're too good - I have a hard time eating them at a rational or reasonable pace.  I've had a lot of dried mango brands, and this one takes the cake every time.<br /><br />There's not much else to say - these are mango slices in a bag.  They really pack 'em in there, you're getting your money's worth on volume.  They are "dried" but this doesn't mean tough or leathery by any means; they're always soft and tender.  Occasionally you'll get one that's got a bit of that fibrous stuff in it that all mangoes have, but it's rare - maybe one or two per bag, if that.<br /><br />These mango slices DO have a light dusting of added sugar, so if you're looking for something without added sugar, these may not be for you.  But honestly if sugar is a big concern for you, probably dried fruit isn't what you want anyway.

review/summary: Worst Hojicha Ever..
review/text: This has got to be the worst tasting houji I have ever consumed in all my years of drinking it. Houji is my favorite tea, and have tried many different brands, and this one is by far the worst. Upon opening the packaging for the tea bags I received the most stale smelling tea aroma of any tea I've ever purchased. After brewing for 10 minutes (which is longer than normal), the color of the tea was a very very pale brown, almost looked mucky. Houji should turn the water a vibrant amber color, this did not.<br /><br />I would never recommend this tea to a tea novice or expert. If you want true quality, import straight from Japan, as it is a Japanese tea. However, one of the better tasting houji teas I have tasted is Yamamotoyama Roasted Green Tea Houjicha, and it can be purchased on this website. If you cannot afford, or do not want to spend a lot of money on quality tea, Yamamotoyama is your best bet.<br /><br />Hopefully you found this useful!

I actually only drank half and for me it gave me the lift I desired -  the taste was nice & not crazy sweet.  now I am having trouble finding this product so came on here to search for it.  Esp. since I picked up a 5 hr one since I was unable to find the red bull energy.  The 5 hour berry one is not for me-  it was so crazy sweet and had an odd taste.....  although it did give me a lift as well only drinking half.<br />Anyway-  my review is  I like the Red Bull one so much better a milder taste, worked the same & am glad I found it on here.

review/summary: Absolutely disgusting
review/text: I've been something of a Red Bull addict for a decade now, drinking it not for its energy effects (as my body has built up quite a caffeine tolerance) as its interesting flavour, nice and quite different to any other beverage I've tried. Seeing this fairly new Red Bull Energy Shot product as an impulse buying item in my supermarket checkout, I thought I'd give it a try. It's awful.<br /><br />What you are getting here is not the same as Red Bull in an aluminium can, except with more caffeine per volume. Rather, it's uncarbonated and significantly thicker. The only comparison I could draw is cough syrup. And if you're much of an energy drink fan, you're probably too used to caffeine to get the rush of energy that the product promises.<br /><br />Consequently, even if you love Red Bull in the can, I'd really suggest trying a single one of these shots from the shop before ordering a bulk shipment here.

review/summary: Fantastic ancho chile powder!
review/text: I have used ancho chile powder for years, but not organic nor mail-order.  This product is SO much more flavorful that I am amazed.  I don't know whether it is because it is organic or so much fresher than what you can buy in the store--which actually I couldn't in the metro Dayton, OH area.  I use it to bring out flavor.  It is mild and wonderful over beans, in stews, even in tuna fish salad! It deepens the flavor where you might use paprika without the sting that cayenne can impart.  By using it, I need to use less salt.

review/text: I ordered this not completely paying attention so I was a little caught off guard by the heavy citrus overtones.  It was not the traditional earl grey I had anticipated.  With that said, it is different but good.  I don't think that I will be buying it again as I feel the citrus takes over a bit more than I would like and I am a bit of a purist when it comes to my earl grey.

review/summary: Organix Organic Adult Dog Food by Castor & Pollux 12.7 oz.
review/text: I purchased seven (7) varieties of the Organix organic dog food from my local whole foods market for $2.79-2.99 plus $2.31 tax = $37.79--12-12.7 oz cans.<br /><br />There are two types of Organix organic dog food grain-free, and those that have grain products such as flaxseed meal.<br /><br />My two ShihTzus Darby and Hampshire prefer turkey and chicken over beef and lamb so I purchased the following formulas:  chicken & vegetable; turkey, carrot & potato; chicken & organic brown rice; turkey & vegetable, chicken & brown rice; turkey vegetable; turkey & vegetable (grain-free); and chicken & vegetable (grain-free).<br /><br />Darby and Hampshire's typical diet is roast chicken with brown rice and mix vegetables.<br /><br />Their snacks normally consist of non-nitrate hot dogs, pan fried chicken livers, butter fried sweet potatoes or mashed sweet potatoes, turkey meatballs, cheese wedges, Bullies, Merrick sesame sticks, 2-TBS of Haagen-Daz vanilla or butter pecan ice cream, and the occasional non-nitrate cold cut.<br /><br />After tropical storm Debbie swept through Central Florida, I knew I needed to find a nonperishable dog food to stock for the hurricane season in preparation for power outages.<br /><br />I had searched for years for a high quality nontoxic and reasonably priced dog food that Darby and Hampshire would actually eat.  The Organix organic dog food was a hit.  When they see the cans they stand up and take notice.<br /><br />When I opened the can, I could clearly see the difference in quality, and I could certainly smell the difference.  A can of Organix organic dog food is 95% organic, and made is the USA!<br /><br />A typical can contains 7.5% crude protein, 6% crude fat, 1% crude fiber, and 78% moisture.  The feeding recommendations are 3/4 to 1 1/4 per 15 lbs. body weight per day.  The dog food also contains several vitamins (Vitamin E, A, B12, & D3)and minerals.<br /><br />Several of the varities contain organic garlic and thiamine mononitrate which is a synthetic form of vitamin B1.<br /><br />I am so very pleased with this find.  After 4 years, and many bad purchases I've finally found the right food for Darby and Hampshire.  What an awesome dog food.  It really smells and looks like human grade food.<br /><br />I also purchased the Organix dry dog food but Hampshire and Darby both had a week of uncontrollable diareau, and Darby was also vomiting.  I returned the Organix dry food to the store, and they gave me a full refund.<br /><br />The Organix dry dog food made their feces very dark and running and the stains were more difficult than normal to remove.  Darby is 4.6 years and Hampshire is 3.11 years.

review/text: Ok...Temptations treats are like crack for kitties and if they don't get their little treats morning and night they lock me out of the house.

Be sure to share with your neighbors so they too will suffer supplying their cats with kitty crack.  Note to self, buy stock in this company.<br /><br />Excellent used as treat when training your cat.  My cat now jumps through burning hoops, water skis and works part time with The Flying Wallendas.
