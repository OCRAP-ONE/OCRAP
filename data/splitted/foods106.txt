review/summary: Delicious but not the best
review/text: This truffle oil is quite good but I prefer the Plantin brand, which is from France. The Urbani is from Italy. The Plantin is more expensive but it is oh so delicious. I have tried both black and white and both are good. Black is a bit stronger, or more pungent. In any event, this is a very healthy alternative to butter! Enjoy!

review/summary: Ok
review/text: This stuff is ok, not great but not bad. Trying to find anything made of real ruffle and only real truffle is futile. As far as I can tell, and from my research, no company in the world makes a truffle oil that is only made with real truffles and tastes ok. This stuff is only good for using at Olive Garden.

review/summary: The emperor has no clothes
review/text: I have had real truffles only once that I can recall, and that very old memory is of a sublime taste.  The slippery terminology used for 'truffle' oil gave me pause, but I decided to take a chance.  To me, "infused" implies that something has been marinated in a liquid, not that a chemical has been simply mixed in.  Sure enough, the ingredient list on the bottle is limited to olive oil and truffle "aroma."<br /><br />When I opened the bottle, I could only detect a garlic-like aroma, pleasant but not sublime.  I first tried adding 1/4 teaspoon to a small serving of scrambled eggs, and could detect nothing.  Today I made a 'two egg' (1/2 cup of eggbeaters) omelet flavored with tarragon and filled with simple sauteed potatos, scallions, and mushrooms.  I drizzled on a full teaspoon of the 'truffle oil' after the omelet was set, immediately before filling and folding it.<br /><br />Again, I could discern no flavor or aroma other than the above ingredients.  I rated this at 2 stars rather than one on the charitable assumption that a younger nose might detect some sort of aroma.

review/summary: bad shipping
review/text: I ordered this product and the Urbani white Truffle oil and it arrived broken because they shipped it in a box with nothing inside to protect it. It was just 4 glass bottles thrown into a box and shipped. Also there were no markings on the box to say it was fragile or that there was glass inside.  When I tried to go online and return it I was told the items were not returnable.  So I just bought some expensive, broken, oil.  I will not5 buy from this again and would advise everyone else to do the same.

review/summary: Great rich taste
review/text: This is a deeper, richer, more gingery and rooty tasting ginger ale than you might be used to.  Give it a try!  I love it and it makes other ginger ales seem tasteless and watery.  The diet version doesn't taste diet-y.  Also, Vernors for some reason keeps its fizziness longer than other sodas even after you've put ice in it.  If you like ice cream, vanilla ice cream in Vernors makes a really awesome ice cream soda.  Now I want one and I don't have any more Vernors!

review/summary: Strange after-taste
review/text: I've been on a ginger ale kick lately and switched to diet since every brand of regular ginger ale I can find sweetens their drinks with high fructose corn syrup instead of just regular sugar. Anything made with or from corn makes me ill, so I've been drinking. I've had the diet Canada Dry version, as well as various store brands from Brookshire's, Albertson's, etc. I ran to the grocery store near work today to pick up something and grabbed a six-pack of Vernors as there were no other options for diet ginger ale.<br /><br />The after-taste is almost like saccharine, even though it is sweetened with Aspertame. It is reminiscent of TAB soda. The taste of ginger ale is there, but there is a chemical-esque taste as well - almost soapy.<br /><br />I won't be getting this brand ever again.

review/summary: you can really taste how fake the sugar is---gross!
review/text: Ew...I love Canada Dry and Schwepps, and I decided to try this brand because it was cheaper and it looked authentic. Not sure how the regular (non-diet) kind compares, but this tastes so diety--it's gross. I usually drink diet soda and don't mind the taste of diet coke, diet dr. pepper, diet sprite, (other diet gingerale, too) but this is REALLY GROSS. don't get it! You can definitely taste the ginger, but the overly saccharine taste ruins it.

review/summary: Good but oil of bergamot overrides black tea flavor
review/text: Earl grey is definitely one of my favorite flavors, however I had to knock a couple stars off the Twinnings brand (sorry - their other products tend to be the best!) as I find the Bergamot flavor to be too strong.  It borders on fruit/perfume.  Those who like the Bergamot flavor to overtake the tea flavor may rate this a full five stars, however for me it was too much like candy (I compare it to the way grape candy would come through your nose) and not enough like tea.  I find the celestial seasonings version of this tea (in decaf) to be flawless.

review/text: Twinings is a great tea maker. And their Earl Grey is the best IMHO. I love to save money, especially when buying K-cups. You can buy a 25 pack for $9.99 at the Twinings USA website. Buying 2 packs plus shipping is still less than the $30 advertised here.(depending on where you live). So if your a fan, buy from the source. Happy Hunting! And also a place called [...] has good prices too. I don't represent any of these websites, I am giving back to consumers, because we sometimes pay too darn much for things. Pay it Forward and share good value! Smiles...

review/summary: Not bad, just not great.
review/text: I love Earl Grey tea, but I'm trying to avoid caffeine. I was happy to find the Twinings Decaf Earl Grey tea, because locally I can only get herbal tea K-cups if I want to go caffeine-free. I have had the Twinings brand Earl Grey tea (with caffeine) in both tea bags and in a Tassimo T-disc. The K-cup version of their Earl Grey tea seems to have a much stronger bergamot taste than the other versions. I like my tea on the weak side, so I brew on the 10 oz. or 12 oz. setting - even so, the bergamot taste is still very strong (almost too much). If you are looking for Earl Grey K-cups and don't mind caffeine, I would try the Celestial Seasonings or Bigelow brands - they are better. If you are trying to avoid caffeine, these will give you more options and although not great - they still make a decent drink.

I prefer my tea black, hot or cold, but this earl grey is not tolerable unless drank with a splash of milk and sugar (splenda for me though). It is undrinkable as iced tea.

review/text: I was sent English Breakfast tea in a Decaf Earl Grey Box.  The incorrect k-cups were in the wrong box and strewn haphazardly in the box.  It seemed rather unprofessional, like someone had just thrown what they had in their kitchen in a box and sent to me.  I am not happy to say the least.  Amazon customer service was wonderful and refunded me.

review/text: I received my order of Twinings Earl Grey K-Cups today and anxiously tried one tonight. Wow, I am disappointed to say the least. Funky smell, taste and aftertaste compared to Bigelow's Earl Grey. Now I have 49 K-Cups that I don't want. Not all Earl Grey's are created equal.<br /><br />Edit: I mistakenly left this review for the decaf Earl Grey and I ordered the regular blend. Oops

review/summary: misleading, still contains MSG, but great stuff nonetheless
review/text: They replace the sodium chloride with potassium chloride, with is arguably healthier while still being salty tasting, however they replace the free form MSG with hydrolyzed soy and corn protein, which is arguably worse then MSG and certainly contains MSG. It's against government regulations to say something has NO MSG then have hydrolyzed proteins as ingredients, but if you can get by that, the stuff tastes great!

review/summary: Cavender's All Purpose Salt Free Greek Seasong
review/text: I used Cavenders Greek seasoning for the first time several years ago when my sister sent me 2-8 oz. containers as part of a birthday gift.  It is one of the best, most useful and prolific gifts I have ever received.  I use this seasoning on chicken, beef, pork and seafood dishes and in soups and stews as well.  This is one of the best seasonings I have ever used.  I refuse to cook without it. I use the salt free Cavenders as often as I use the Cavenders with salt.  Whatever your choice,I suggest that everyone who wants to pump up the flavor of their foods try this seasoing and like me, you will make it a staple in your household.

review/summary: Bland - what am I missing?
review/text: I love Greek food and was excited to find this product with all the positive reviews since I don't cook a lot.  I took one reviewer's advice and bought some at Wally World at a considerable savings.<br /><br />My first (and probably last) attempt was chicken breasts, chick peas and sweet onions in a slow cooker.  I poured on the seasoning as I added each layer (onions, seasoning, chick peas, seasoning, chicken, seasoning, chick peas, seasoning, chicken, seasoning) to the extent that I though surely I had overdone it.<br /><br />The result was tasteless.  There was no flavor at all.  It's not that it wasn't flavorful enough, it was flavorless.<br /><br />I confess that I grew up in a household where we ate "world food" all the time, we just didn't know what it was because we had no cable TV and there was no FoodTV back in the dark ages anyway.  I live in an area where authentic ethnic food is everywhere.  Maybe my taste buds are completely fried (I do like me some spicy hot anything!) but to me this has less character than a moderate sprinkling of plain old black pepper, which is no character at all.

review/text: Our cabinets are filled with every salt-free seasoning there is. We rely heavily on Mrs. Dash, and really love it. However, I saw this listed on Amazon.com, and it was the first time I had ever seen it. Based on good reviews, I not only purchased it for my house, but sent a package to family members with heart issues. Now that we have all used it, the reviews are in -- all of them great. So far, we've used Cavender's on chicken cutlets, whole roast chicken, talapia and cold pasta salad with chopped vegetables. We love it and will make it a definite part of our spice rotation.<br /><br />If you are looking for something new to zest up the flavor of salt-free food, Cavender's All Purpose Greek Seasoning is really quite good!

review/summary: BEWARE!  THIS STILL HAS MSG IN IT!
review/text: Some of the other reviewers noted that they still had reactions to this product.  Look at the ingredients - any sort of hydrolyzed vegetable protein contains MSG.  This is a trick used by most companies in the food industry.  There are like 25 different names for MSG- or free glutamate-containing substances, and they just hide it under a different name  (Google "Other Names for MSG" and you will be appalled).  Unfortunately the FDA does not require any real disclosure on labels - MSG can also be labeled simply as "spices" or "natural flavors."  It's safe to go ahead and assume that any flavor base seasoning such as that used here will have some type of MSG in it.  If another processed product such as flavor base is used in creating a new product, the ingredients in the component product (e.g., flavor base)are not required to be disclosed on the label. At least this manufacturer had the decency to list what was in the flavor base.

Especially if you overdo it, like I tend to do.  They so addictive!<br /><br />The blue food coloring is easily brushed off the teeth, but expect at least a full day before your tongue and lips turn back to normal.<br /><br />These babies contain malic acid, the secret to their incredible sourness.  Taken in too great a quantity, malic acid can have an odd effect on the taste buds.  Nothing you eat later will taste right.  The effect goes away after about a day, too.<br /><br />Sounds like an awful lot of fuss just to have sour belts, huh?  But if you like sour like I like sour, it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />These belts are not delivered in a hard plastic case, but in a clear plastic bag.  You get a lot of them!  Store them in a resealable container to keep them soft and fresh.

review/text: A few times a year (Easter, Halloween, Christmas, and Valentines) Hershey's comes out with their holiday Reese's edition.  This is absolutely the best time of year - for chocolate and peanut-butter lovers.  The holiday editions are not just fun shaped Reese's cups - they are the "Premium" edition of what a cup could be.  They, if I may be so bold, are the perfect combination of soft milk chocolate and creamy peanut-butter - the absolute perfect ratio of yummy goodness.  The fact that Hershey's only puts these out 4 times a year is either 1)marketing genius or 2)sadistic and hurtful.  Do I recommend you buy these?  Yes - yes I do, especially if you love Reese's and want to experience that next level.  I vote that Hershey's design more of these - President's Day anyone?  Independence Day?  Groundhog Day?  Tax Day?  Okay, I'm willing to help design a shape for any day of the year if it means I get more of these delicious things.

review/summary: Not our best idea
review/text: As a treat to our 2 year old ACD mix, we bought this bone for her.  She loves her nylabone durachew (much to my dismay) and we were aware that this one was actually edible before we bought it.  We don't often give her treats like this, and she really seemed to love it.  So much so, in fact, that the entire thing was nearly gone within 10 minutes..... and we purchased the largest one - the one with the first on the end since our dog is 50+ lbs.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling about it, and a few hours later, it was confirmed.  My dog started gagging and then vomitted.  She ate it at about 4pm and got sick around 10pm.  Slept through the night, although she woke me up a few times, and was still licking her mouth and gagging the next morning.  I don't know if it's because the bone is really rich and she's not used to it, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's a product you and your dog are already familiar with as it was our experience that it made our dog ill.<br /><br />If you do purchase this product, definitely make sure you watch your dog with it - if they're eating it too fast, consider taking it away so they don't devour the entire thing in 10 minutes like ours did.

I do not recommend it at all.<br /><br />My dog loves Nybone products. All the other ones seem to last a long time. I guess this "Edible" line is just made for eating and not chewing. In my opinion, the price is way too high for what you get. I highly recommend other Nybone products, but steer clear of this one.

review/summary: Dog loves it, but I don't after reading the ingredients
review/text: First thing first, my dog goes absolutely nuts over this!<br />She can smell the roast beef flavor from another room.<br /><br />I originally bought this as a healthy alternative to rawhides for my dogs teeth.<br />But after reading the ingredients, there is really nothing healthy about it.<br /><br />It's nice the product is fortified with vitamins, but not so nice when it's full of grains and fillers as the base ingredients.<br />I went with Sam's Yam's Sweet Potato Raw Hides, as they are truly "natural".<br /><br />But for those who are feeding low-grain or no-grain dog food, this should be ok as a once-in-a-while treat.<br />But if your dog is on a more generic dog food, then there is absolutely no place for even more grains in their treats.

review/summary: Tasty but not durable at all!
review/text: I purchased this nylabone for my 4 month old teething puppy. I figured she'd enjoy a tasty chew toy. She's quite the chewer so I was thinking the bone would last a day or two at best. However that was wishful thinking! In less than 20 minutes, she had consumed all of it but the bulky end (which we threw away). We couldn't believe how quickly she chewed it up! Definitely not worth the $8.

review/summary: My dog choked on the Edible Bone
review/text: Warning to other dog owners: the edible Nylabones are extremely dangerous for dogs with a big & greedy appetite.  My dog swallowed it whole within 30 seconds of giving it to her and choked on it.  She was fully unconscious before I could dislodge the bone and breathe into her nose to bring her back to life... We almost lost her over this bone.  If your dog is a greedy chewer or eater, then please don't buy edible Nylabones.

review/summary: Very special treats
review/text: Boy our dogs go crazy for these treats, I buy the regular sized ones and cut them into thirds, they are easy to cut and our dogs are small Yorkies so the third portion is perfect for a treat. They are good for their teeth too. We have one 12 year old and her teeth are perfect. They are one of our dogs favorite treats that we buy. Your dog will love the flavor and they are made in the USA. Can't beat that, just wish they were a bit cheaper.

review/summary: Too expensive & made my dog puke!
review/text: My German Shepherd is incredibly picky when it comes to treats... So I was incredibly excited that he was finally happy about a toy I had given him.<br /><br />I, however, was not happy that it only took him 8 minutes to eat the entire thing.<br /><br />I was also not happy when he puked the entire thing up (and his dinner) 12 hours later at 4AM... Customer reviews are pretty consistent that this product is too expensive for what it is, and is making the dogs sick.<br /><br />I would never recommend this product to anyone, and will be informing my fellow dog rescue colleagues never to buy this product.

review/text: I paid $7.99 for the colossal sized one I got my Great Pyrenees puppy.  In less than 7 minutes she had eaten the entire thing.  I cannot afford to entertain my dog for more than $1 a minute.  She loved it, but I will not purchase this product again.  My girl is actually very gentle with her toys too.  At 11 months old, she has yet to destroy a single one of her stuffed toys.  If it's an edible chew toy though, I've found nothing that can stand up to her jaws.

After reading other reviews I took it away from him and will save the rest for a later date.  I was hoping for a bone that would last a little bit longer as a chew toy and not just be eaten like a treat.  Will not be buying this again.

review/summary: If you know what you are buying, these are great.
review/text: Let me start off by saying I love these. My dog gets so excited when he gets one of these. These are not durable and go away within an hour or two, but they are meant to. These are not meant to be for a teething puppy or for a chew toy that lasts. These are supposed to be super special treats that you give your dog once in a blue moon (Like if you are leaving to go on a trip). Yes, they are expensive, but for a reason. They are made in the U.S. and for those of you that do not know, it is healthier to get treats from the U.S. if you can. They are also healthy. One Dentastix is about 300 calories and I read many reviews saying it gave their dog diarrhea and made them sick. Yes there is a review saying this made their dog sick, but he probably ate it too fast. Your dog may need to be watched while eating these. These are meant for a treat and not a bone that lasts. But my dog loves them and that makes me happy!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, "natural," flavored bones and thought.... "SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.

review/summary: is eaten way too fast
review/text: I was under the impression when I bought this at our local pet supply store (based on salesperson's advice) that this bone, while edible, would take several days of working on to be consumed.  Great.  It's a little pricey, but I have a teething 5 month old puppy who has recently been spayed; she can't get her regular course of exercise so I bought this as a nice treat to help keep her occupied in her restless state.  I took it away from her (mad dog!) after 45 minutes.  Just one end was left.  I had bought her the largest "souper" size.  After reading the other reviews, I count myself lucky that she got that much time out of it.  Yes it's a "treat", but at $6, it's a treat I cannot afford to give her very often.  Health wise it's not a treat I could make a habit of feeding often; I feel I have to give my puppy less dinner tonight to make up for the large amount of calories she just wolfed down.  I hope that it doesn't make her sick as it did another reviewer's dog.  I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it, break up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out.  All for a LOT less money.  That said, I give it 0 stars for value, 5 for "my dog loved it".  It gets a 2 overall from me and I probably would not buy again, nor would I recommend to a friend.

review/summary: Once in a while special treat
review/text: My 9 month old 45 lb pit bull is an avid chewer who has and will eat just about anything he can find, including my hard wood floors.. while picking up bird food I grabbed one of these relieved that at least when he devoured it he wasn't eating chunks of plastic and hence wouldn't get mad when I had to take it away and throw it in the trash.  I came home, read a magazine, he sat quietly on the sofa beside me happily chewing and by the time I had finished my magazine he had finished his bone.  While certainly not a long lasting chew it is something I'd pick up again when I get bird food since I know he enjoys it.  I used to buy the stuffed regular bones but then I'd end up with him wanting to play fetch with the empty bone and would end up throwing it away so at least I know this isn't something that months later i'm stepping on getting out of bed.

review/text: I wish I had read the other two reviews here. I picked this up at a local store for about 6 bucks. My dog just ate half of it in 5 minutes and would be done with it now if I had not taken it away. And he is only 5 months old...so an older bigger dog could destroy this even quicker. I can't believe they actually sell these...at that price at least. He absolutely loved it and is quite mad I took it away...but not worth the money.

review/summary: doesn't last very long
review/text: As the initial reviewer stated, the biggest issue with this product is its durability, or lack thereof.<br /><br />With the Nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile.  I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist).  It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to 'clean up' the mess.  If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product.  It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.<br /><br />I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).<br /><br />My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I can't justify it.

review/text: My dogs had to be on food with limited ingredients for a while and this was the best of the types I tried. The dogs ate it easily (although without great gusto) and it helped us get through the medical issues that precipitated our use of it.  Vet recommended. I wouldn't use for day to day dog food, since other flavors without " limited ingredients" appeal to the dogs more.

review/summary: Cats Love it, but . . .
review/text: First, I have to say my cat loves the Fussie Cat foods. She has a malabsorption problem and switching to Fussie Cat has really helped with the throwing up and loose stools. We've tried almost every variety and am impressed with the quality; hence the 4-star rating. Being able to get this brand with subscribe and save rocks and it saves me a lot of money.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the Tuna with Shrimp case just came and was full of dented, slightly damaged cans. None of the cans have broken open or been punctured, but the dents aren't minor and since these are sold as 'new' I shouldn't be receiving dented cans. Hopefully this is just a one off occurrence.

review/summary: It really helped my dog!
review/text: I have a 9 year old lab mix, and she is over weight and simply not active.  She would breath really heavily even when she was just laying around!  I assumed that her not being very active had to do with age, but my vet reccomeded a diet (and i agreed).  I looked around at some foods and decided to try avoderm weight control dry kibble.  My dog wouldn't eat it at first, so i tried to mix it in with a higher protein kibble (Premium Edge), but she still wouldn't eat it. I topped it with a little bit of avoderm chicken and rice canned to the mix (1/4 can to 3 cups of dry kibble), and she DEVOURED IT!  After a month of this diet, my dog lost about 3 pounds, her eyes looked bright and she even started romping around again!  I'm SO GLAD I switched to AvoDerm foods!! And so is my Reba!

review/summary: Ordered both Thick and Filets products - COLD PACKED FOOD
review/text: I am double posting this review for both the thick cut and filet versions of this product. So you may see it twice -- YES, I did order BOTH products.<br /><br />1) This product comes COLD packed in a wine brine with onions (as was expected) - read this next part carefully:<br /><br />This is a cold product - IT MUST BE SHIPPED and KEPT REFRIGERATED, because it has no preservatives.<br /><br />Make certain you have ROOM in your fridge for the jar(s) which are slightly different than the one pictured (thinner diameter straight wide-mouth jar and taller, which makes then easier to fit in the fridge).<br /><br />2) If you don't normally consume this product in this form (packed in wine sauce) then don't buy it. It would probably be considered to be an "acquired taste" by most. Buy a small jar in a local grocery first to try. If you like it then order this larger jar.<br /><br />3) This brand does appear to have a stronger fish taste (up against the brine), than other brands I have tried. The fish taste is stronger on the thick cut product, which may be preferred, depending on your tastes. My guess is that would diminish over time while marinating in the "wine" and onion based brine.<br /><br />4) I suggest that you might try just one jar at a time. Remember IT MUST BE KEPT REFRIGERATED -- it can NOT be stored without being refrigerated in a pantry.<br /><br />5)This brand is pricey with shipping costs. You may be able to purchase locally if you don't require Canadian packed herring.<br /><br />6) Eating fish may be good for you, and if you like this type of product, it might be an easy way to consume larger amounts of Omega fats other than downing supplements. You could live longer, but you will need to brush your teeth or chew gum more, or you may become an old person with fish breath. ;)<br /><br />Finally I should note that this was the second shipment sent, but I never saw the first box which I was told was damaged during delivery.  The product was cold packed with freezer packs in a polystyrene lined box. Parthenon Foods sent an email about the damaged shipment and offered refund or re-delivery -- no hassles. So they are very easy to work with and have good communication. I would order other products from them again. (I HAVE ENOUGH HERRING IN MY FRIDGE TO LAST A WHILE! ;)
