review/summary: Delicious, Want More!
review/text: I ordered 2 boxes of these chocolate because our family loves them.  We ate all of them in a very short time. I want more and have for over a month. Amazon does not carry them anymore so I can't get free shiping and handling.  I have to order<br />them from an independent company who charges s & h so consequently I have not<br />purchased more. I have requested that Amazon carry them again, but so far they have not reponded. I certainly would order them if Amazon would carry them again. Yummy!!

review/text: I am disappointed in the product and the company.  The product was completely ruined upon receipt...each layer of candy was smashed, though the outer shipping box was intact and without a single dent...leaving me to believe that it was damaged prior to being shipped to me.  I have a confirmation from the USPS that the item I shipped back was received, but I have not yet received a refund...and it has been 19 days today.<br />I would not recommend this company to anyone!

review/summary: Cella Cherries
review/text: Order these every year for the holidays. The box arrived without a mark on it, perfectly intact, except for the contents.  31 of 72 cherries were broken.  The box was soaking wet and the entire box was unusable. Being the cellophane around the box was filled with pink liquid, I have no idea how it was not noticed that the box was bad before it was shipped. I will never purchase from this company again.

review/text: This is the first time I bought the 72 count, and there are allot of cherries in this box.  When I start it is hard to stop. This candy is one that my children bought for their father every year.<br />We would go and buy a box for about $2.00 and he would pretend to be surprised every time they gave him a box.  He is gone now but we still buy a box and put it under the tree.<br />these are a nice cherry flavor and the chocolate, could be a bit smoother but it is fine just the way it is.

review/text: As any depressed chogoholic will tell you, some days you need a reason to see the half fullness of life.  Cella's Milk Chocolate Cherries is akin to step one in the battle against a world filled with trickery and deceit.  I buy these at pharmacies from time-to-time but this great product ships fast from Amazon at the best price,  You can start your search for any product at any point on the web or retail but you can be sure it ends at Amazon.

review/summary: Absolutely wonderful!!
review/text: If you like chocolate covered cherries, you will LOVE these!  I am picky on the quality of my chocolate and also the cherries, and I have never been disappointed in Cella's.<br /><br />In one or two reviews I noticed that people had mentioned how some of the candies had "leaked".  Yes, you might see some sticky liquid in the box, but it made no difference whatsoever in the condition of the chocolates themselves.  I never found a single piece that did not still have liquid inside, nor did this affect the quality of the candy in any way.  I am thinking that this small bit of "leakage" is inevitable when you have this type of confectionary. I ordered two boxes of 72 in the last month, and I have been 100% thrilled - both with the quality of every single piece of candy - and also how quickly this company ships your chocolates!  Order with confidence ... you won't be sorry!

review/summary: One of the best brands of chocolate covered cherries!
review/text: I absolutely love these chocolate covered cherries. I have seen reviews on other sites, comparing the different brands, and I see a lot of hate on these for no fondant in the center. That is really why these are so good! I like cherries with both the fondant (key: if it's good), but also the liquid centers. I had these for the first time as a child after usually getting just Queen Anne cherries, and I still love these. Zachary, the brand Walmart and a lot of other places carry, are just gross..the chocolate is grainy and cheap tasting. It is getting increasingly hard for me to find Cella's in stores. I usually only find them in a local drug store or discount mart by chance, but I'm so happy to find them here. Also, dark chocolate cherries are so much better in my opinion, but Cella's is the only brand that I actually like the milk chocolate too! Its a wonderful, crisp, creamy chocolate. Yum! Can't wait to get these and eat them! I've been getting by on Queen Anne (which are equally as good in their own right, meaning fondant centers)so I can't wait to finally get a box of Cella's!

review/summary: Same great taste!
review/text: Golly, writing this review is making me drool!  Years ago, you could only buy these in Ohio at Christmastime.  However, some wise soul figured it would make good marketing sense to make them available year round for us addicts and well, voila! No more buying tons of these boxes at Christmas and storing them in the freezer all year!  Golly these things are awesome!  I've been eating them for 40 years and still can't get enough of them. In my husband's family, they were always the first gift of Christmas, delivered from Santa.  These things are in so many family traditions, that they HAVE to be doing something right. The only difference I notice is that the cherries are smaller than they were 20 years ago.  Other than that, they haven't mucked with the taste, the cordial filling, or anything else!  Highly, highly recommend!

review/summary: sold out at Safeway for the holidays but I crave more!!
review/text: Have been a chocolate covered cherries fan since I was a kid...and for years the Queen Anne kind were all the rage in our household--but I then found CELLA'S brand.  And even this season our local Safeway and Giant food stores were selling 24 count boxes for $3.99 a box and I ate a ton of them. But as soon as Christmas was over, my Chocolate Covered Cherries were gone too!  So nice to know I can find them on AMAZON, even if I do have to pay a little bit more.  And being a dark chocolate fan I thought they would end up being my favorite, but I was wrong...the milk variety are still the best and by far better than Queen Anne which their centers are white and more solid. BELLA'S centers are more clear syrup and not solid which I enjoy better. LOVE this brand and Amazon's great service!

The olives are big, yummy, perfectly brined, not too salty queen olives in a smooth, dry vermouth that yes - gave me a bit of a buzz even before I mixed it with gin to create a tasty martini. The only thing that kept me from clearing the supermarket shelf of these olives was the cost - in store they're $6.99 and it was a good distance from my Brooklyn address. I took it as a sign that the Universe was trying to help me manage my olive addiction. I almost opened the second jar on the subway - I need help and olive lovers you need to try these olives.

review/text: These are not sold in any grocery stores near to us and so I ordered them here on line. They are very good, not as syrupy sweet as some others we have tried and very refreshing.<br /><br />The only down side is the price of the shipping which keeps us from ordering these on a more regular basis.

review/summary: High Fructose Corn Syrup
review/text: I am disappointed that these contain high fructose corn syrup and also because they do not count toward a fruit serving, even though they state they are made with real fruit. However, they aren't exactly junk food since they are made with real fruit and whole grains.  Definitely not the healthiest option though.<br /><br />Since my daughter enjoys them and they aren't messy, I will give them two stars. I serve them to her a few times a week, along with a serving of fruit and yogurt or milk, to make it a healthier snack or breakfast.  I do think a product from Gerber should be a little more health conscious for our little ones, so as soon as my daughter finishes these bars, I will be switching her to Earth's Best Organic Sunny Days Snack Bars or Earth's Best Organic Tots Cereal Bars.

review/text: Okay, so I agree most of the Gerber items can be a little more costly than just going to the big chain stores to buy them. However, I bought these while Gerber was running a 30% off sale which when paired with the discounts given through Subscribe & Save and being a member of Amazon Mom I got these for right around $1.30 a box. Besides the price these are a wonderful product. My daughter loves them! They're easy for her to hold, feed herself & chew easily. I'll probably buy another box while they're still on sale.

I do have a slight energy lag when the effects wear off. After 5 hours I do feel tired so you need to time when to take it.

review/summary: "So tasty for me," as my 3-year-old would say
review/text: This bag is so addictive that I just about went into withdrawal when I couldn't find it once at my local warehouse store.  I love chewy dried fruit, and this stuff really hits the spot.  I don't agree with the review who said that the flavor of the mango and banana is "off," because she's probably just used to tasting the chemicals other companies use to preserve the color of their fruit.  The ingredients on this bag read: "organic bananas, organic mangoes, organic pineapples."  That's it.<br /><br />What she and I CAN agree on is that the current Amazon price of roughly $15 is ludicrous.  I just picked up two 16-oz bags at my warehouse store for $0.99 each.  (I think this was a mistake, because they were labeled on the shelf as $3.99.)  Definitely shop around, and try not to eat the whole bag in one sitting.<br /><br />Not that I would know ANYTHING about that.  (Ahem.)

The pineapple is fantastic (no complaints only love).  The mango (and trust me I have eaten plenty of dried mango) has a flavor and texture that is just off.  The banana...Um, gross, but I don't eat dried banana normally (I'm a freeze dried, banana chips kind of girl), I don't want to even go near this banana.  The texture and taste...UGH.  Skip this bag, but try out their pineapple on it's own, it's fabulous.

review/text: My uncle Bilbo always woke up to a hearty bowl of porridge in the mornin'. Nothin' goes better with a sunrise in the Shire. If you want your life to be a little simpler, and a lot better, do as Bilbo does, and buy Bob's steel cut oats. There is a goodness inside these little morsels that you don't get with the normal brand, it smells great when you cook it.<br /><br />I take mine with a pat a' butter and a sprinkling of sugar, and as this is the heartiest porridge you can 'ave, some might, as I do, take a wee bit a' milk to thin things out a bit. If you wan't to muck it up with fruit and spices, be my guest, but it's general hobbit practice to keep things as simple as can be.<br /><br />Buy this porridge, and you'll live happily ever after, to the end of your days.

review/summary: Steel cut oats are the way to go, for the sake of texture.
review/text: While you may not be astounded by the difference in flavor from standard rolled oats (the standard these days on the shelves I see), the difference in texture is quite nice. That subtly chewy texture from oats that aren't over-cooked is nice to have, and makes quite a difference. As another reviewer stated, add some fruit or season it, don't expect a cereal grain to be appealing on its own. This is a healthy cereal with decent fiber content, some of which is soluble (helps with cholesterol) and some insoluble (colon health). And as amazon purchases go, the price alone isn't horrible.

review/summary: Finally, a way to hydrate in the Texas sun
review/text: I spend all day working in the Texas summer sun. For years I've had issues with hydration, I could drink 2 gallons of water a day, but was having trouble replenishing electrolytes. The various sports drinks caused stomach trouble and are expensive. As I got older, the problems of chronic dehydration became more severe. I'd wake up with intense leg, back and foot cramps that would take hours to relax. Finally, I found an answer. I have been drinking nuun ( 2 tablets per day ) for the last few months and I haven't had a single attack of leg cramps since. I only use 1 tablet per gallon, it's plenty for my needs. What a great product and a reasonable price!<br /><br />I add this flavor to my cold-brew tea mix and then freeze it overnight. It's a delicate hint of berries, and tastes just fine.

review/summary: Love the smell and taste and price
review/text: I have been buying the gold label virgin coconut oil from Tropical Traditions for years.  I usually buy 1 gallon bucket at a time.  I transfer some to wide mouth mason jar from the plastic bucket.  I try to avoid plastic, but buying it in quart glass jars cost 2x more.  I was out and getting ready to order another bucket.  I am glad I decided to read some reviews on other coconut oils on amazon.  Based on reviews for this oil (single jar, but I bought 12 pack) I decided to try it.  I love Dr. Bronner's soaps, so why not buy this oil.  I know prices change on amazon.  I bought this set for $104, I calculated the cost to compare it to tropical traditions (1 gallon bucket on sale for $75+7.37 shipping snail mail=$82.37) and this one 14 oz x12= 1.3125 gallon which boils down to $72.24 per gallon).  So it turned out to be cheaper AND in convenient glass jars, so I don't have to transfer the oil from bucket to jar.  Another plus:  it smells better than Tropical Traditions.  I know TT can vary in taste and smell from batch to batch, and mine might have been older since I was on my last 1/2 quart.  I just loved the fresh smell of Dr.B's coconut oil, taste matched the wonderful coconutty aroma.  It might help with taste and smell retention by having it in separate jars that don't get open until use (not like the bucket that I open once or twice a month to refill my more convenient container).  Another thing I love about this oil is that it comes in standard jars that have an opening to fit canning lids.  I can my own produce and my town doesn't recycle glass.  I can reuse these jars myself or give to friends who can their produce.  Local beekeepers also welcome them to put their honey:  they can use standard canning lids.  The only bad thing I have to say about this oil is not on the product itself but the company that sold it to me (poor packaging or maybe poor delivery on UPS part).  Some people think it doesn't belong in the review of the product, some think customer service is part of it, so I'm including it as well.  The jars weren't packed well and 4 lids got crushed and oil leaked.  Glass wasn't broken (luckily).  Company has a very good customer service and offered me a choice:  refund or replacement of the damaged jars.  I'm happy and give this product 5 stars.

review/summary: The Best Mexican Picante Hands Down
review/text: This hot sauce is so tasty with Mexican food / Tex Mex that for me personally, nothing even touches it. This isn't a hot sauce that I would use for Buffalo Wings or home fries. This stuff lends itself to tacos, nachos, burritos etc so well that it's hard to describe. I'm a hot sauce fanatic and I love habenero hot sauces, but habenero hot sauce just doesn't work on a taco like this stuff does. I always thought it did, and it is very yummy, but not like this stuff on Tex mex or Mexican chow. I live in Upstate New York and travel a lot for business. I buy this stuff on the west coast for $1.29 a bottle at the grocery store, bubble wrap it and bring it home in my luggage. I think about this hot sauce some times. It's amazing. To put it in perspective for you west coasters, I hate Tapatio. It's got too much vinegar. This stuff does not. I would like to thank the creator of this hot suace, because it's that good. It really stands out on Tex Mex especially. Mmmmm.YUMMY ! ! ! !

review/summary: Hot but not too hot - a nicely blended hot sauce. Purchase this "extra hot " variety. The regular version is Not Recommended
review/text: Lets face it - the Mexicans love hot food and generally know how to make a fine hot sauce. While the label (in small print) says "extra hot" there are many other sauces which are far hotter.  Think in terms of needing 5 or 6 drops for a bloody mary rather than spoonfuls when using this sauce. It is far from being "extra hot". I'd call it medium hot.<br /><br />Important: There is a significant difference between this "extra hot" variety of Valentina hot sauce and their regular variety. The easiest way to tell the two apart is the regular version has a light yellow background on the label and this one - the so called "extra hot" has a black background on the label. To my taste, the "extra hot" is far superior.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): water, chili peppers, vinegar, salt ...<br /><br />Which chili peppers Valentina used is unknown, yet the company has certainly created a nice blend. You can easily detect some sweetness in this sauce and that has to be due to a nice blend of the chiles. There are no added sugars!<br /><br />Normally I don't like any vinegar in a hot sauce, yet I don't mind it all in this particular version of Valentina. The difference may be this sauce uses actual vinegar while most others use acetic acid (a chemical component of vinegar) and the chili peppers dominate in this particular variety of Valentina. I want to emphasize that this is ONLY true for this particular blend.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is a nicely blended hot sauce worthy of your consideration. My four star rating means this is a very good hot sauce but, depending on your palette, you might find a few that are better.<br /><br />Warning: there is a significant differences between the regular Valentina and the "extra hot" (black label) variety that I'm reviewing here. In the regular version a heavy taste of vinegar is painfully evident while the "extra hot" variety is much better balanced, ie, the vinegar is in the background. So it is quite important that you choose the extra hot version - the one with a black background on the label.<br /><br />This is a near perfect hot sauce for a bloody mary and most other foods.<br /><br />BTW: Watch out for sellers that price the sauce low but charge very high shipping charges on a per bottle basis

review/text: I have discovered Valentina sauce while traveling in Washington. Being a hot sauce lover I couldn't pass up this bottle when I saw it at the local supermarket. This sauce is thick if compared to other sauces such as Tabasco brand. It sticks nicely to the food. It's adequately hot, although not the kind of hot that burns your taste buds for a long time. It's made in Guadalajara, Mexico which adds a little mystery to it. If you're into hot sauces definitely try it if you stumble upon it. I don't think you will regret it.

review/text: This is amazing stuff. I don't really know how to describe it adequately, but it is amazing. I slather it on anything mexican or tex-mex that I eat (burritos, chili, etc) and at least try it on just about anything else (usually it's pretty good!)<br /><br />It says extra hot, and I suppose it is compared to average hot sauces, but it's nothing unbelievably painful or ridiculously spicy or antyhing... it mainly has a really good flavor while still providing a nice kick.

review/summary: A satisfying hot sauce
review/text: For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce Extra Hot has set itself apart from the others.  It has a satisfying flavor and is neither too hot nor too mild.  This is a product that I can recommend.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: I copied this from a post I wrote on my blog a while back. I only changed the price to XX.<br /><br />This has become my preferred hot sauce. I had never heard of the brand before but saw it on the shelf at WalMart maybe a year ago and bought a small bottle to try. I really like it so it is now what I use mostly as hot sauce, several times a day usually. It comes in regular and extra hot. I have tried both and prefer the extra hot, although it is not that hot. It is about right for me. I go through a bottle or 2 a month.<br /><br />Ingredients: Water, Chili Peppers, Vinegar, Salt, Spices, 0.1% sodium benzoate as a preservative.<br /><br />As an added bonus, the 1 liter bottles are &lt;$XX. Made in Mexico. it comes in a smaller bottle as well, but I get the 1 liter size. I have one at work and one at home.

review/summary: Great choice for bulk green cardemom pods
review/text: I have been very happy with the quality of this cardamom. I use it in my chai tea. I've never purchased the pods before, so I can't compare them with other sources. What I can say is that they have been an excellent flavor addition to my tea.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because some of the seeds inside the pods have a white color. The majority are a nice dark black. It is my guess that this is the color that they should be. The black seeds seem to have a more robust scent.<br /><br />For those of you who are seasoned cardamom users, please let me know if it doesn't matter what color the seeds are. Thanks in advance!

review/summary: Excellent Proudct and Fast Service
review/text: I ordered this product from Amazon with hesitancy, which I normally buy from Indian grocery stores.  When I placed the order the shipping date showed as 30 to 45 days, but it arrived in 7 days.  The product was fresher and cheaper than any grocery stores. I add it to Indian tea and some desserts to give a rich taste and flavor.  I was thrilled with the experience of ordering a food item from a website, from where I only bought electronic items. I have never seen such green color in cardamom pods in any grocery store.  The grocery stores carry old and very pale green color cardamoms, making them look like they are stale. This is one of the best purchases I made at Amazon. I ordered the Sun Maid Golden Raisins along with this order to avoid paying shipping charges and plus I use Golden Raisins as a snack, and put in desserts.  I give this product 5 stars as it arrived on time, and when I opened the packet it was fresh, and full of flavor and would highly recommend buying this product from Amazon.

review/summary: Not for cooking, just for drinks
review/text: This is not why I gave it 3 stars- that's below- I probably should have done more research before ordering. I was in a bit of a rush though after seeing them use cardamom on Top Chef so I just ordered the best deal I could find. Turns out these Green Cardamom are used in drinks, like teas. If you want to use as a spice get the Black Cardamom which is much more pricey.<br />Still, had I known what I was doing, I would still only give 3 stars. As described it does take over a month to get these, they are shipped from India they say, however even by boat a month seems long. If you think you'll get them sooner than what they say...don't count on it.<br />The main reason for the 3 stars though, is because inside the green pods(hence the name) are supposed to be a clumop of little black seeds. Well over 60% of the pods I got had clumps of little tan seeds. Not sure if they weren't ripe or just weren't cardamom. I do know that there are a lot of fake products out there, and with such a high percentage of the wrong color seeds, it made me doubt the entire delivery.<br />With that doubt I can't justify a better rating. My advice for prople looking for Green Cardamom: Do some research, know what you want, and test different suppliers by ordering small batches until you find one that gives you all green pods that are all filled with black seeds.

review/summary: Good Quality, with one reservation
review/text: I make my own Chai tea and go through about a pound of cardamom during the winter.  This product is great for that purpose.  The taste is just what I expect.  However, if you are looking for perfect pods you might think twice.  Approx 20% of the pods are broke open and the seeds are in the bottom of the bag.  Maybe I got the only bag that someone sat on?  I usually order from cardamom spices DOT com and the pods are perfect, excellent quality products.  However, they are a bit more expensive than the Frontier Cardamom Pods.<br /><br />I got the 16 oz for slightly under $25, added a bag of sea salt for $3, bringing my total over $25 and got free shipping.  I love Amazon!

review/summary: A *must-have* household staple
review/text: This sauce is medium heat for everyday use.  It has an excellent roasted pepper flavor, and there is *NO VINEGAR* to get in the way.  Consequently, you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce...versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it.<br /><br />An every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue.  This is not a boutique novelty, it's a household staple.  The 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household.<br /><br />You want good?  Try Tapatio on cottage cheese.  You'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again, I promise.<br /><br />I use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream, but my personal favorite applications of Tapatio are:<br /><br />eggs<br />potatoes<br />pizza<br />anything creole (forget tabasco!)<br />cottage cheese<br />most rice<br />mac cheese<br />and of course...Mex<br /><br />In my opinion, this is the best sauce in your local grocery store.

To compare this to Tabasco is an utter mockery, but that is the most common "hot sauce" that most Americans have experienced, so that is the one that I will compare it to.  Anyone that would try to genuinely compare the two should have a CAT scan done.  A 7 out of 10 as far as hotness, Tapatio can go on anything that you need to make spicy and tasty.  Try putting a couple of squirts of this Mexican nectar in a bag of Doritos and you WILL NOT be able to put them down.  Buy the 32 oz. size, you will not regret it!

review/text: This is without a doubt the best-tasting hot sauce I've ever had. I first encountered this sauce at a Mexican restaurant, among the other condiments on the table, and decided the cheap, simple-looking logo and foreign-sounding name merited a try for curiosity's sake. Boy, am I glad! I'm so used to the tongue-scathing, vinegary sourness of brands like Texas Pete and Frank's RedHot. This was so refreshing, it tastes so peppery and flavorful. The heat is definitely still there, but not overpowering like other sauces I've tried. I highly recommend giving this hot sauce a try.

review/summary: Absolute Favorite Hot Sauce
review/text: Have tried many hot sauces over the years, but Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce is my favorite. After my local grocery discontinued it, I was bereft. Was so very pleased to discover that I could order it through Amazon. The first listed ingredient is chili peppers (in contrast to so many whose primary ingredient seems to be vinegar); it is hot without be mouth-numbingly so. It really is a delightful addition to a Bloody Mary (but, I must admit, I use it on many, many other things, from scrambled eggs to tostadas to all kinds of soups). I purchased this product from Amazon through Mex-Grocer; recently one of my shipments was lost in transit. They were so very great about following through, rectifying the situation, and apologizing that I wouldn't consider ordering from anyone else in the future. Would have to admit that I am somewhat addicted to this salsa.

As a result, the hot sauce adds flavor instead of taking away.<br /><br />In fact, it may taste too good. The heat has a way of sneaking up on you. I'd say it is about as hot as Tabasco, but you won't notice the heat at first.<br /><br />Tapatio is hands down the best hot-sauce available and I use to to add flavor to everything from pizza to spaghetti to mac and cheese.

review/summary: A nice blend. Medium heat - not too much vinegar and a smart buy in the 32 oz size
review/text: I really like this sauce. It is a great blend! While there is nothing truly remarkable about it - more importantly - it has no obvious flaws.  It simply has a nicely balanced flavor and that alone is quite rare in hot sauces!!!! This sauce could or should be a staple in any kitchen.  I'm glad to have a bottle in my pantry.<br /><br />I would rate this sauce somewhere between mild and medium hot. You'll need more than a couple of drops but not much more than that to generate some heat in any dish. Compared to Tabasco's original you'll need about twice the number of drops.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Red Peppers, Salt, Spices, Garlic, Acetic Acid (a component of vinegar), etc ......<br /><br />Note the relatively low level of vinegar within the sauce. That is a good thing. The type of red pepper is unknown but there is a natural sweetness to this sauce which I find quite pleasant. That sweetness balances nicely against the heat. View this sauce as a superior alternative to a very common benchmark - the original Tabasco hot sauce.<br /><br />Minor flaws: There is a bit too much salt in this sauce but that only becomes evident when used in an already heavily salted dish. For example: This is not the best choice for a Bloody Mary due to the heavily salted nature of most vegetable/tomato juices.<br /><br />Since this sauce is available in 5 oz, 10 oz and 32 oz sizes - you'd be wise to pick up the 32oz size given the fact that it often costs little more than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />This is a fine basic hot sauce with a natural sweetness to it. This sauce is worthy of being a staple in any kitchen. It is better than most. What it lacks is that rare sense of freshness and, as noted, there is also a bit too much salt.

review/summary: Great product, quick shipping
review/text: I received this product from a friend of mine who is from AZ and immediately fell in love with it.  It's slightly thicker than Tabasco and Trappey's, but not as sour, and with a little bit more heat.  It goes well with almost EVERYTHING.  So, I knew what to expect.<br /><br />I bought two large bottles.  The seller shipped the package quickly, except that the cap on one of the bottles was loose, so the hot sauce leaked a little bit; otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars.  But that won't stop me from buying from them again next time I run out.<br /><br />Highly recommend to those who want a little bit of heat, without having too much of a vinegar base.

review/text: I've tried many different sauces.  Tapatio stands at the top of the pack.  It's not as spicy as Tobasco, but spicy enough without the vinegar taste.  You can use it with lemon on Doritos Chips, and Ramen Noodles.

review/summary: A favorite hot sauce
review/text: For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others and has become a favorite.  When I was given a bottle of this hot sauce for the first time, as far as I remember, I was just expecting a typical hot sauce--this is not typical hot sauce.  It is hotter than the other hot sauces that I like, but it is not overpowering and does not have a searing heat--more like a peppery heat.  In addition, Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has a pleasing, exceptional flavor.  This is a hot sauce that I prefer to use only for special occasions.  It is recommendable.

review/summary: Superb sauce
review/text: A little more heat than cayenne pepper sauces like Tabasco but nowhere near as hot as the hotter habanero sauces.  It has a great flavor that goes well with a variety of foods, flavors salad dressing, sandwich spread and barbeque sauces and make the blandest dishes come to life.  It ranks in the upper tier of my favorite sauces.
