review/summary: Senseo coffee pods -get 'em through AMAZON.COM
review/text: I purched a Senseo single cup coffee maker because I had seen one at my son'e place in New England and the coffee was delicios. However, the coffee pods are almost impossible to find in the retail market, even in Manhattan. Thanks to AMAZON.COM I get my supple at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner

review/summary: Prefer it over Starbucks (and I love Starbucks ;-)
review/text: It is all about the right mixture and the better way to brew a nice cup of coffee. We add lots of hot milk to it and make out own latte. This coffee is our espresso replacement and tastes so good! It is a coffee our European visitors really appreciate.<br />There are 2 reasons to prefer it over Starbucks, it is heck of a lot cheaper and it tastes at least as good (to me).

review/summary: Good choice for a daily cup
review/text: My first impression was that it was just a decent cup of coffee, but after a week of drinking it, it ended up trumping all other choices, even the espresso pods.  Largely because of cost - the espresso is highly addictive (yes, I think it's that good) and I can't afford to drink three double-shot lattes a day!!!

review/summary: WONDERFUL MORNING CUP OF COFFEE
review/text: If you like a stong cup of coffee, then this isn't your Senseo pod. However, I love a medium roast with a little bit of a bite to it and Breakfast Blend is just that. I enjoy this cup of coffee each morning with a splash of a flavored coffee creamer.  The best!

review/summary: Sumatra is the best pod from Senseo
review/text: I've tried all of Senseo's coffee pods and by far the Sumatra blend is the best they have to offer.  DH and I have been drinking this blend since it came out a couple of years ago.  Even my cousin's wife, a Starbucks manager, admitted that it tasted along the lines of Starbucks coffee.  This is a good buy from Amazon with their discount and free shipping with autoship.  Don't bother with the flavored blends (french vanilla, hazelnut, Irish blend) they are sure to disappoint with their weak brews, try this one instead for a full bodied, rich cup that is not bitter like their dark roast.

review/summary: As good as it gets
review/text: Senseo is a great product and the pod based system of making coffee yields a fresh cup time after time. It's just a shame this particular coffee is so average. There's nothing wrong with it, just a compromise of flavours that leave you underwhelmed. Described as a "blend to get you going in the morning", this isn't going to get you anywhere. It is, however, not going to make you spit it out and if you fancy a nice, average coffee that delivers a nice, average flavour then you'll like this.<br /><br />I use it as a third choice between decaff (for late nights) and dark roast (for mornings following really late nights!)

review/summary: Close to Dark Roast, but nice to taste something with a bit more body
review/text: Sumatra is very close to Dark Roast, but if you get bored with Dark Roast, you should try this one. It has just a bit more flavor than Dark Roast, just that extra you need. It may get a little bit towards Starbucks Coffee, but not too close, so it's not that sharp, but it does go more in that direction, but still smooth enough. Well, what else can you say about flavor, just try it yourself.

review/summary: great coffee - ok price
review/text: My wife and I have been drinking this for years and love it.  We keep trying all the supposedly "best" coffees from Kona, Africa and Jamaica.  This is still the best, and convenient too.  My wife prefers it without the foam, so we use a Malita brewer, which operates on the same concept, but you kind of have to stuff the pod into the smaller holder.  However, I'm not enthusiastic about the price like the other reviews.  I'm in south Texas and here we pay between $3.09 and $3.89 per bag at the local grocery store (HEB the largest store in our part of the state.)

Being in a 1 coffee drinker household, there is less waste and trouble making a cup in the Senseo than brewing up coffee in the coffee maker.

review/summary: Best Senseo Pod Yet
review/text: I've been through most of the pods for the last two years, and finally found my favorite about six months ago.  When the Sumatra arrived, I still had Medium, Dark, Brazilian, and Columbia on hand for comparison.  As it turns out, I didn't really need to compare because the Sumatra stood on its own from the first cup and is exceptional.  Sumatra is a dark, rich blend that finally fills my need for a stronger coffee with a pleasant character.  It took a long time but I finally managed to finish off the other blends.  Sumatra is all I order any more.

review/summary: Excellent dark blend
review/text: This is a similar blend to the Senseo Dark, but with a smoother finish. No bitterness or burnt taste at all. My only reason to give 4 stars rather than five is that the pods are a little weak. They contain about 10% less coffee than the Senseo Dark blend and it makes a difference in the cup. I normally make a two-pod cup anyway, and deal with this slight weakness by simply shutting off the brewer a little early. Another reviewer complained that the specific varieties in the blend are not stated and that therefore the taste may vary from batch to batch. I'm not an expert by a long shot, but I do drink a lot of coffee and I've been using this blend for about a year with no detectable variation.<br />Sometimes when I want the slight extra kick of the Dark blend but still want a smooth finish I will use one pod of Dark and one pod of this Colombian blend. (That's one thing I like about the pod brewers over the Keurig style: one can mix and match).

review/text: In these days when we're all trimming our budget, buying my Senseo pods this way saves me quite a few bucks!  #1: This subscription  is the cheapest way to purchase pods that I've found. I paid $4.24 per box at WalMart, which is the lowest price in my area.  This way, it is $3.94 #2: It saves me a trip to WalMart, thus saving gas.  #3: When I go to WalMart, I will spend more money than just for pods, thus I eliminate any impulse buying. #4: Free delivery and no tax just sweetens the pot. #5: It is so convenient!  Frequently, WalMart was sold out of the dark roast pods.  I don't run out of pods anymore!  I am SOLD on this subscription arrangement.

I was looking for coffee I could put in a tea kettle and make without any mess of coffee grinds and thats why I bought this (not going to buy the expensive little coffee makers for pods!).<br />  I boiled a few cups of water and dropped in a pod earlier today.  Stirred it around then let it rest for awhile.  I added sugar milk and vanilla and served myself a cup.  It is very good, no bitter or yucky after taste.  I'm pleased. :)

review/summary: About as good as it gets for the Senseo brewer
review/text: Re-write of earlier review after more than a year: I previously compared this blend to Starbucks Verona with (to quote Starbucks) a "bold intensity, with a rich, smooth and slightly sweet" flavor. I had more or less absent-mindedly migrated to the Senseo Colombian blend over the last year or so, and just recently again tried the Senseo Dark because it came with a new brewer. I stand by my earlier comparison - the Senseo Dark is similar to Starbucks Verona. And I still find the main weakness with this blend to be that it's just slightly too weak...which you can counteract by killing the brew process early and getting slightly less than a double cup from the two pods.<br />You _can_ make better coffee than this in the Senseo brewer but not by much. The Colombian Blend is smoother, for example, but not as rich and not as sweet.

But I will certainly keep ordering them from Amazon, they have great deal with the subscription service and I can't find them locally.

review/text: I'm not a coffee snob, barely drinking a cup a week, but my significant other needs a strong mugful every morning.  The pods and the Senseo machine are perfect for this; barely takes 2-minutes to brew.  The 6-pack box comes out to about 30cents a cup even with the added latte packets (60cents when two are used for a strong mug serving).  I'm hoping the money saved by avoiding Starbucks every morning will go to my potato chip addiction....

review/summary: Senseo Sumatra Pods are Great!
review/text: I have used a Senseo maker for about three years, making 3 to 10 cups a day. (I'm on my third machine.) Mostly I have used other brand pods for the bolder flavor, but these Sumatra pods are about as good as any I have tried.<br /><br />Some other brand coffees I like are from Wolfgang Puck and Reunion Island; however, these other brands wreck the mechanism of the Senseo due to the thicker pod. These Senseo pods work better and taste just as good.<br /><br />I lived in Germany for three years and really learned to like European style coffees. Nothing makes crema like a Senseo!

review/summary: Weak, no flavor dimensions
review/text: Went for economy in latest order and got the 6 pack as I could not recall what Dark Roast tasted like. Counted on all the positive reviews, but we all have different palates, don't we? I prefer Senseo's Kenya or Sumatra as a more reliably flavorful brew with Sumatra probably my favorite. Just opened my first of six bags, so I have a ways to go before I get to the end of my "bargain" purchase of a brew that is weak and one-dimensional. I guess I will have to play with the amount of water and pods as other reviewers suggest to try to get something strong enough to satisfy. Just can't throw it all out!

The site still says "Out of Stock", but I think if you place an order they'll start catching up to demand in a little while.  Many thanks to the person who wrote the review explaining the move of production facilities.<br /><br />We tried a Mr. Coffee Keurig style machine while we were unable to get Senseo, but couldn't find any coffee as good as the Douwe Egberts pods.<br /><br />We're very please to see the return of the Senseo Dark Roast pods, and I hope that my subscription for the French Vanilla pods will also be available again soon.

I finally called the company and was told that yes, it is being removed from retail stores but will still be available "on-line" and from places like Amazon.<br />I signed up with Amazon to have this coffee shipped to me automatically. I get 3 cases every 2 months. It's convenient but the price fluctuates and you don't know how much it's going to be. First time it was $70, two months later it went up to $90. I hope Senseo doesn't price me out, cuz I'll miss it.

review/summary: WTF Amazon ???
review/text: OK - so to start with, I LOVED my Senseo coffee system.  Have gone through 5 machines in 10 years - they eventually leak and cause problems so it's easier to buy another.  That being said the last couple of years it's been harder to find another machine (Ebay mostly) but I NEEDED my Senseo.  Then this past spring (May, June) I stopped receiving my Amazon shipment of PODS and found out that they were becoming obsolete everywhere.  Couldn't get them.  Period.<br /><br />I had to break down and purchase a Tasimo machine and the coffee to go with it (lots of plastic waste in the little cups) but I digress . . . so I've been 2 months with this new machine, and what arrives at my door last week ????  A CRAPlOAD of Senseo coffee pods!!!!!  Not one month's supply but THREE.<br /><br />Now I ask you if I drink coffee everyday, and you stop delivering my coffee for 3 months . . . . how (or why) do you think that when you do come into some inventory that I'd want (or need) to have the three months worth of coffee  . . NOW???  Those days are gone and I invested in a new machine.<br /><br />I'm sending them back, if anyone else needs them ;)

After all these years (6+ at least) of drinking Senseo coffee - and it's getting impossible to find at any of my local grocery stores - I had come to completely rely on Amazon as the one place where I could always find Senseo coffee pods. I realize this is likely not Amazon's choice, it may be as sad for Amazon as it is for me. I have to echo the sentiment I read in another's comment on the site..."what do I do with my Senseo coffee maker now, plant flowers in it?"

The other day I get this email saying it is on a HUGE sale, BIG savings etc.  I got so excited, because as we all know coffee is expensive, but can't live without it.  I opened the email to see a huge LIE.  They showed the regular price, which wasn't the regular price.  IT was a crazy jacked up price.  Then it said you could save this huge amount...which was the regular price.  It made me so angry I almost quit my subscription.  That is so wrong.<br />But yes, the Senseo is awesome.  Perfect, rich....wonderful everytime.  I will never go back to a conventional coffee maker.

review/text: I purchased a single serve coffee maker that used the "pod" verses the K-Cup, because I thought it would be less expensive, and because I knew I could use 2 pods if I felt I wanted to make a stronger cup of coffee.  It turns out that it still wasn't strong enough for me, for the amount of coffee I drink.  In order to fill my travel mug to take to work, I found I was using 4 pods every morning, and the savings just were not there.  I ended up buying a new coffee maker (Keurig) and got a good deal on Amazon for Coffee People K-Cups and found that with the right kind, I can fill that travel mug using 1 of them and the taste is outstanding!

review/summary: Light is an understatement -- NO flavor is more like it
review/text: Okay, so I like a strong cup of coffee.  I tried the Senseo Dark Roast and it was very good -- bold, but smooth taste.  The breakfast blend was really weak and tasted a little bit like wet cardboard or, as the Peanuts comic once said, like hot water with a brown crayon in it that needed more crayon.  I even used TWO pods for the smaller cup of coffee and it was still way too wimpy for me.  It still had the nice crema layer, it just had no taste.  I realize everyone has different coffee preferences.  But for someone who likes a stronger, more espresso-like coffee, I would tell them to steer clear of this roast.

review/summary: Beware Senseo Quality control-- Bags leak coffee
review/text: I bought four cases of Senseo Breakfast blend, both caffeinated and decaf. Every coffee pod in every bag had a hole at the seam. None were sealed properly, and I lost a quarter of the coffee that I purchased, half of which was on the bottom of the bag that contained the pods and the other in my coffee maker before I figured out what was wrong. I had to staple bags in order to use them.  Called Senseo and they said to contact Amazon. They could not replace the coffee because they "did not stock it at the office." Huh?? They said that if I gave them my name, address and email, they would send me a check for what I paid. Of course they did not, and they got my personal information. Don't buy this in bulk. Buy one container at a time or you will end up with a wasted purchase.

review/summary: Easy Way to Shop for Coffee
review/text: We live in a rural part of California. Finding Senseo Dark Roast locally was impossible. Amazon has many choices of Senseo coffee pods including our favorite Dark Roast. Amazon has an easy way to get it to us. We signed up for the autosend monthly delivery and safe on the cost of shipping. The purchase price is discounted as well when we have it sent automaticaly. What's nice is that an e mail from Amazon comes before the schedualed shipment to ask if we want to adjust our order for this month. It's all so easy. Thank you.

review/summary: Where is the taste?
review/text: I like my coffee strong but not bitter.  Douwe Egberts is generally so so coffee but it at least has some taste. These Senseo coffee pods are different; no taste whatsoever!  It is as if they shipped old pods that had been sitting outside their packaging for a long time. Very disappointing.<br /><br />Note that I do get a "care package" from friends in the Netherlands sometimes which includes a dark roast coffee Senseo pod, also from Douwe Egberts. The package is different and contains more pods, more importantly the taste is entirely different.

review/summary: Broken pods, stale coffee, not like espresso at all
review/text: These obviously don't sell well, the box I got had several broken pods and coffee grounds all over the place.  Just made a cup, had to throw it away.  Contacted Amazon and they gave me a refund even though the 30 days had passed.  Buy the Dark Roast instead; it tastes much better, is fresher and obviously sells better so they rotate stock more often.  I still had a little of the Dark Roast left, just compared the two, it's not even close.  Bottom line...1 star for this coffee, 5 stars for Amazon customer service...so a 3 overall I s'pose...

review/summary: Coffee Review
review/text: I had tried Timothy's Pod before going back to the Senseo Pods.  I prefer the Senseo Breakfast Blend over the others that I have tried.  It has a great flavor to it and love the foam on the top.  Do not use the Timothy brand pods in the Senseo machine as they do not fit without having to do some adjustments.  Also, this is a great price for 6 packs if you sign up for the automatic delivery.

review/text: Nice idea, very convenient, but pods do not seem to have the same strength and body as ground coffee that's measured out.  They certainly don't have the same quality as freshly ground beans.  The service, OTOH,was fine.  Order came promptly and package was in good condition.

review/summary: Mixed Feelings
review/text: This is an attractive machine, looks good in my kitchen.  My husband and I use different coffees and love the convenience of having whatever brew we need available, cup by cup.  It's easy to operate, the coffee smells good and tastes good.  Having said that, here's the downside.  It's not very well made.  It has been recalled for some electrical difficulty that could have been disastrous and the replacement broke down within months.  I am now on my fourth or fifth one and if this one goes bad in the next two years or so I am going shopping for another brand.  Sometimes I think I keep buying them just because it's so fast, efficient and pleasant to deal with Amazon.

review/text: I'm not a very big coffee drinker, but absolutely LOVE this particular blend. I tried the light roast and the dark roast as well but they were a tad bit too light/heavy ... this is just perfect!<br /><br />Everyone who comes to our home and tries this coffee is surprised how good it comes out -- plus the foam that the Senseo coffee maker adds in the end is just the perfect touch :)<br /><br />Will def. recommend and buy this product again.

review/summary: Senseo French Roast
review/text: Since "the big corporate takeover" I find that it doesn't really matter what products customers request on a local level.  All that matters is what "corporate" dictates. While I used to try to support local businesses, I have now almost completely stopped shopping at both Wal-Mart and Target because the local stores are forced to cater to corporate whims instead of being able to serve their customers' needs.  It is nice to be able to order the coffee I want from Amazon and have it shipped to my door.

review/summary: I Threw It Away
review/text: I ordered this coffee because of all the positive reviews for these pods.  I have tried making coffee from the pods, and I have found ALL of it undrinkable. My goal was to make a medium-sized mug of coffee.  With one pod, the coffee was way too weak.  I then tried two pods, and the coffee was still not strong enough.  It lacked flavor, and I found it very flat.  (For sake of reference, I like medium strength coffee.  Starbucks Coffee, for example, is too strong for me.)  Regardless, I managed to squeeze 3 pods into my coffee maker, but the coffee was now horrible.  Ok, so I thought, let's go back to 2 pods and vary the amount of water.  After some experimentation, I found that 2 pods and 10 oz. of water gave the proper strength for my taste.  However, nothing could help the flavor.  I detested the flat, stale taste. Do yourself a favor - skip this product.  Now I know why the pods are relatively cheap - you get what you pay for. I'm not a coffee gourmet, but this coffee is worst than the over-boiled stuff that is left at the end of the day in the office coffee pot.

review/summary: Better coffee from a can
review/text: There's no denying the Senseo is easy to use, and 'greener' than any of the other pod brewers out there. But the Dark Roast coffee was stale and dry, with the same aroma and flavor of a canned coffee that's been left sitting out too long.<br /><br />A pod brew will never be AS GOOD as drip - I get that. But that won't stop me from looking for something close.<br /><br />If you want easy and are not picky about taste, this pod's for you. If you want a pod brew that is at all reminiscent of a decent cup of coffeehouse java, keep looking.

review/text: This coffee was purchased in the past before for my husband.  Due to circumstances beyond my control I no longer needed it.  I had cancelled many automatic shipments in the past - hoping that I would be able to start them up again in the future, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.  Eventually I cancelled the entire Sumatra account.  I never actually took possession of the coffee for it was being held at the post office for signature - not sure why.  When I went to the post office they showed me the box and I asked them to return it.  Please contact me about the refund to my account at your earliest convenience.  TYVM.

review/text: When I got the the pods i thought they were "fake" made by someone other than Senseo.  The pods were loosely packed and would not set level on the pod holder resulting in week coffee.  The pod also did not have the senseo logo printed on the pod.  Calling cust service they changed how the pods are made and some are still out untill they are phased out.  Sucks!  The new pods are packed better but you still need to place then carfully r the coffee is weak.  I would not buy a large pack.  Stick with the single pack so you don't wast money having pods that dont work
