review/text: I use this on Mexican dishes, rice, beans, etc.  I am a huge fan of Habanero sauces and this green sauce takes the cake.  I haven't found anything similar in quality or spiciness.  Highly recommend if it if you enjoy a nice hot green sauce.

review/summary: Pretty Good Hot Sause For Soups & What Not
review/text: I like this hot sause also, not as much as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EOMQ9E">El Yucateco XXXtra Hot Kutbil-ik Mayan Style Habanero Hot Sauce - 4 oz</a> tho. I have a hard time eating this sause when its dumped over a plate of Mexican food. I use to to heat up weak salsa, add a little kick to soups and what not. The flavor is good, but theres just something about it. I have alot of both sauses stocked up for survival / food storage reasons. It's something to have on hand during hard times. I buy mine from out local Mexican Tienda which we just got not too long ago, anyways if you want to try something hotter then this sause give that Mayan sause a try and be careful with it.

review/text: El Yucateco makes a bangin' sauce.  It's fairly thick and sticks well to food (not too runny).  It's sweet, and it's got a little bit of kick to it.  I'd give it a 4/10 for heat, a 7 or 8 for flavor.<br /><br />My only issue is that it only tastes good on Mexican food.  I've tried it on pizza and eggs (staple hot sauce foods for me) and I was left disappointed.  But on a taco?  This hits the spot.

review/summary: Quite Hot -  If you want pure heat this may be you your sauce. Yet there are even hotter ones but do you really care?
review/text: This GREEN Habanero sauce is quite potent. Two or three drops is all you'll need for a bloody mary and only a few more drops will add considerable heat to any family sized dish.<br /><br />The Habanero chile is one of the hottest chiles known to man and in its immature state its color is green. So these younger chiles are slightly less hot than then the older red ones.<br /><br />This is a pure heat source with little if any other flavor beyond the overwhelming heat. If you really think hard about this sauce you might (?) be able to detect a vague hint of vinegar (which is the Acetic Acid listed in the ingredients).<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Habanero Pepper, Salt, Acetic Acid (a chemical component of vinegar), .... etc<br /><br />Conclusion: There is nothing special about this sauce beyond its considerable and concentrated heat. While there are some very vague vinegar notes (from the Acetic Acid) -  there is no real character to this sauce beyond pure heat.<br /><br />Yet that my be all you want. A potent heat source and this one certainly meets that mark!<br /><br />If you decide to order this sauce --- Watch the seller's shipping charges which can often be excessive and won't drop even if you order multiple bottles at the same time.<br /><br />I'd pass on this hot sauce because of its lack of character - 3 stars is about right. But if you are looking for just pure heat then give it 3 or 4 stars or even 5 stars.<br /><br />If you want even more heat then look for a Habanero sauce that does not list water as its first (therefore major) ingredient. There are other Habanero sauces which are even hotter but I'll confess I'm not a big fan of tasteless but ultra hot chile sauces.<br /><br />Tastes do differ so you may want to try this one. In all fairness I gave it three stars because it offered pure heat without any obvious flaws.

review/text: If you are familiar with crispbreads, you'll love this. If you expect a 'snack cracker', move on. These Ryvitas are everything they should be, bland enough for tasty toppings, but adding enough flavor (and crunch!)to avoid being boring. These are insanely good with an aged swiss or dill havarti, with paper thin cucumber and/or tomato sprinkled with more dill. Added bonus for those watching blood sugar or diabetics, a filling carb with a low glycemic index!

review/text: First off, we ordered this in February, and the case does not expire until 7/2010- so I'm glad the product is fresh.<br /><br />Now, as to taste- we found the cracker to be very dense and tasty.  The sunflower seeds give it a lovely nutty flavor.  This will make a great lunchtime cracker with cheese.  This is a crumbly cracker, but the product arrived at our house safely.  I can't think of any downside to it- unless you don't like the flavor of rye or sunflower seeds.  You basically get exactly what it sounds like with this one, and as an added benefit, it does not seem to cause blood sugar spikes- so if you are managing your blood sugar, this might be a good cracker for you (though reactions to foods will vary among individuals, so you'll want to check yourself).

review/summary: Flavorful chewy bites of hearty grains and seeds
review/text: We love Ryvita crackers and go through them like some people go through candy. So far, the Dark Rye are our favorites for use as a standard type crispbread and these Whole Grain Rye Crispbread with Sunflower Seeds & Oats are the most flavorful, yet fragile. We received one case and gave another as a gift and both arrived packed very well by Amazon, but as other reviewers have said, many of the crackers are in small broken pieces. I'm not too surprised because when I bake bread using oatmeal, I get a softer texture which sometimes falls apart.  We will be consuming these piecemeal (pun intended) with toppings that do not require spreading.  Peanut butter, Boursin cheese and fruit preserves will be served with the plain rye crispbreads or the survivors from these boxes, but we will use the broken bits atop macaroni and cheese instead of bread crumbs, and they'll be fine for little tastes of cheese, fish or on a salad.  I usually have no problem consuming foods past their "Best by" dates, but being that sunflower seeds can become rancid, I will be sharing these prior to their May '09 date.<br /><br />Because we've never had these before, we don't know if this texture is standard for the crackers or if it's a result of them not being fresh. In their current condition, I would not call these "Crispbread," but flavorful chewy bites of grains and seeds.  The flavors are robust and the texture feels great on the teeth but I sure wish more individual crackers would come out of the box in less than several pieces.  When they are in little pieces, it's too easy to eat more!

review/summary: California Rafe
review/text: I have just finished reading "and a Bottle of Rum - A History of the New World in Ten Cocktails" and I just had to google my favorite Rum, which is El Barrilito, produced in Bayamon, Puerto Rico.<br />I was born in New York City and I am 63 years old.  My father's favorite rum was Barrilito and so I followed the tradition of drinking this variety at home all of my life.  Though, I must admit that the reason I did this was more out of family tradition along with the novelty of bringing back Barrilito from Puerto Rico whenever I, a relative or friend returned from the island because it was either very difficult or near impossible to get it stateside.<br />With time, I learned to discern the difference between the variety light rums and I learned after time that Barrilito has a deep body and flavor.  I always preferred the three star, aged bottle of Barrilito.  I have always preferred to drink rum straight.  If you do drink Barrilito you will taste the distinct flavor of molasses.<br />The world of rum is a tremendously large one and by having read "and a Bottle of Rum - A History of the New World in Ten Cocktails" by Wayne Curtis, I have learned a great deal.<br />Barrilito may not be one of the greatest rums in the world.  I have not tried that many.  But for Puerto Rican rum, I have to give this rum the highest rating.

review/text: When we first brought our kittens home from the shelter, they only ate some dry Purina kitten food that Purina provides/donates to the SFSPCA (thanks!).  My vet recommended wet food, however, and I wanted to get something grain-free and high-protein.<br /><br />Of the several brands I looked at, I started with BFF - mostly because of the label!  We tried most of the flavors that BFF makes and most were a hit (except the one with pumpkin), but they love the tuna and chicken one the most.  You can see actual white meat chicken and tuna as you get it out of the can, which makes it a little more palatable for me to look at.  According to the BFF website, the ingredients are hormone-free and sustainably farmed, as well.<br /><br />The price and convenience of buying BFF from Amazon is awesome; I only wish I could subscribe and save!

review/text: This stuff is so tasty - the best granola I've ever found, except for homemade.  I'm not analyzing health benefits - I'm not going to eat stuff that's healthy but doesn't taste good.  This beats bulk health-food store granola. I do not like the kind with raisins, & it's much more difficult to find this raisinless kind.

review/text: I love Quaker Granola Cereal, with honey, oats, and raisens, Also I love the Apple, oats, and cranberry kind too! I love the Hormel shelflife dinners. They are excellent, especially the chicken and dressing and gravy. I like the salisbury steak and potatoes and carrots and gravy, and the meatloaf with potatoes and gravy. They lasted me a whole month. They come 6 to a pack.

review/summary: My husband loves this pasta
review/text: My husband is Italian and a big fan of unique macaroni.  He likes this pasta with ragu as it holds up to the weight of the sauce. It does take longer to cook than your average pasta, but it's worth it. My only con is that it isn't packaged great so it gets busted up in shipment.  A little bubble wrap would go along way!

review/summary: smooth, full bodied, and fresh
review/text: I've tried coffee from just about every coffee-growing region, but I think this is my first PNG coffee.  It most reminds me of Sumatran coffee with its heavy body and full, earthy flavor, but with a bit of fruitiness reminiscent of African coffee and a cocoa flavor reminiscent of many South American coffees.  It's very smooth and low in acid, perfect for people who want an easy drinking coffee without sacrificing flavor.  While I hesitate to buy coffee online without any guarantee of freshness, this coffee tasted very fresh on arrival.

review/summary: A calorie counter's dream
review/text: I'm a serious calorie counter but I love my evening ice cream treat. I've been relying of Skinny Cow for years and it's been fine, but I often pined for an alternative that would give me more treat for the calorie. Now I've found my dream. It's almost unbelievable that I can eat a whole pint for less than 150 calories. And this stuff is GOOD tasting.It's not premium, high fat content, high calorie premium ice cream good, but who needs that anyway. The chocolate flavor is really very chocolatey, the consistency is smooth and the satisfaction of not destroying my calorie limit for the day is priceless! Bravo Arctic Zero!

review/summary: Quality control ?
review/text: I received 6 pints of the chocalate flavor.  Four of them were great, rich creamy smooth texture, good flavor.  Two were icy, darker, poor texture, poor flavor.  They looked and tasted like they had melted and refrozen.  As all six pints arrived frozen solid with dry ice remaining in the package, I don't think this is due to shipping.  It looks like they weren't stored properly, or were stored for too long (months).  This is a great product, but there seem to be some quality control issues.  Four of the pints would get an easy five stars, but the other two get zero.

review/text: Thought it does not have quite the sweetness of ice cream, I found the chocolate and chocolate peanut butter flavors to have a very pleasant choclatey flavor and smooth texture.  I let my pint sit on the counter for about 10 min before digging in, and it had an almost mousse like consistency - very impressive!  Hard to believe this stuff is good for me and I can eat the whole pint without feeling the guilt I'd get with a pint of Ben & Jerry's.

It doesn't taste exactly like a pint of Ben & Jerry's (Come on, you you can eat an entire pint for 150 calories, be realistic!) but it's really really good. Like a delicious frozen protein shake. I love the chocolate and the chocolate peanut butter, but they sort of taste the same. (You can't really taste much peanut butter in the chocolate&pb one) I know they're expensive, but if you're in the mood to eat an entire pint, this stuff is great!

review/summary: Price is High; Satisfaction is HIGHER
review/text: I'm in love with ARCTIC ZERO, and I am lavishing a lot of money on this product.  It's worth every dollar, though.  The 6-pack comes encased in dry ice; it is so FROZEN that you almost cannot eat a pint straight out of the dry ice ... I say ALMOST because desperation produces creative approaches to eating even the most frozen pint.<br /><br />I love this stuff, and I would eat any of the flavors.  However, the CHOCOLATE and CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER are the best-tasting.<br /><br />Don't expect ARCTIC ZERO to taste like the 800-calories/pint ice creams.  However, if eating a pint of Ben & Jerry's causes you to go into a deep funk over your excessive consumption, then grab a pint of ARCTIC ZERO and bask in the joy of a 128-calorie alternative that really will pacify your sweet tooth AND MAKE YOU FEEL VIRTUOUS AS WELL.<br /><br />ARCTIC ZERO is my one HUGE EXPENSE, and I wish it were cheaper... but, well, I'm pretending that I'm eating my $7.78 confection instead  of heading to Cheesecake Factory and gobbling down a slice of cheesecake for the same price.  [It's a personal deception since I have long since sworn off cheesecake.]<br /><br />ARCTIC ZERO, please stock the Whole Foods shelves in Ohio.  PLEASE!!!

review/summary: Chocolate!
review/text: I've tried all the Artic Zero flavors, and the Chocolate is my favorite!  I can eat it a whole pint at a time.  The chocolate Peanut Butter is "OK", but I wish they could make it actually have a peanut butter taste.  I couldn't tell there was really any peanut butter flavor at all.  The Vanilla and Strawberry Banana I can't even eat on their own.  I've used them in a smoothie to save ice cream calories, but don't think they are worth the extra expense.  So, I've stopped buying anything but the Chocolate flavor, which I re-order every few months.  I've also tried the Pumpkin Spice flavor, that one bombed too.  I just ordered their Chocolate Mint Cookie flavor and can't wait to give it a try!  I have high hopes for that one!  But if your on the fence of what to buy, try their Chocolate and Chocolate Peanut Butter combo and decided which you like better from there.<br />4 stars, because it doesn't have the "real" ice cream texture you would expect, but for the calories it helps me get my ice cream fix!<br /><br />P.S. sometimes there are occasional problems with some of the pints arriving a little soft and melted.  After sticking them in the frezzer to re-freeze, when you go to eat them they can have an icy texture.  This is unfortunate, because of how expensive they are.  I don't want a single bit to go to waste!  But since I can't find them locally, I have been willing to just deal with it.

I tried the strawberry banana and I've got to say that it was awful, I actually found it unpleasent to the point where it was ineatable.  On the other hand the chocolate was not bad at all.  No one is ever going to mistake it for "real" ice cream, but at 128 calories for a pint of frozen dessert treat it tastes pretty damn good.  At least it satisfys the craving for something "sinful", without blowing your diet.  128 calories versus 1000 plus calories????  No contest - save the Haagen Daaz for really special occassions.

review/summary: Pretty Yummy!
review/text: Firstly, I have not purchased this product from Amazon, but rather from a local grocery store.  However, I might purchase the different flavors someday from Amazon, because my grocer only carries the chocolate flavor.  That's fine with me for now, though, since chocolate is always my very favorite! :)  Of course, this stuff is a huge draw because it's only got the 150 calories per pint that they so proudly advertise.  If it had as much as regular ice cream or sorbet, I highly doubt it would even be mildly successful.  The flavor is very much like a chocolate sorbet would be.  I would not say it is "creamy," because, well, there's no cream in it.  However, it is similar to what I would call a sorbet, and does have a nice texture after sitting out for 5 minutes on the counter.  The only thing I don't like about it is that there is a smidgen of a salty aftertaste after the first few bites, but then again, I'm really sensitive about salty flavors.  Overall, it's not bad at all.  I would recommend this for people with special needs/diets.

Basically there's not been any ice cream I could have more than a spoonful of.<br /><br />Arctic Zero ice creams have 6g of carbs per serving. 6! An entire PINT has 24g, which is the same or LESS than other ice creams have in one SERVING. Heck, it's less than most flavoured YOGURT.<br /><br />Now, this stuff is nowhere near as sweet as other ice creams, but that's just fine. It's still tasty, and the texture is fantastic... if you treat it right.<br /><br />And this is the important part.<br /><br />The first time I got one of these I tried to just eat it. It was rock-solid, and even the part I chipped off wasn't very good.<br /><br />HOWEVER, if you leave it out of the freezer for a while and let it thaw a bit, it'll just turn totally smooth and creamy and wonderful.<br /><br />I've tried all the Arctic Zero flavours I could find and they're all good, with the exception of Cookies and Cream which for some reason is just horrible. Chocolate and Strawberry are fantastic, though. And mixing chocolate, strawberry and vanilla is FUN.

review/summary: Use it for dinner time, fully engaged and learning!
review/text: After reading a bit more about toys that encourage learning and rewards, I came across a TON of reviews for this.  At first I wasn't too sure if it was something my puppy would like, but I decided to give it a shot anyway.  I filled it up with his dinner, and placed it on the ground.  I could tell he knew there was food in there because he was smelling it like crazy.  He then accidentally knocked it over and some food fell out...... suddenly he realized....if i play i get treats!  Normally when I feed him dinner it takes him less than 1 minute or two to woof it down, then he lets out a little burp.  Sometimes he even managed to throw up a bit after because I noticed he wasn't even chewing.  Well, it took him literally 25 minutes to get through a whole dinner with this.  He got a bit frustrated as it was nearing it's last few kibbles, but I think he understands the concept now.  Highly recommended! (my pup is a 6month old shihpoo, 10lbs)

Good challenge.

review/text: Awesome product for hours of entertainment for my dogs. I have several dogs, but bought this specifically for my pug. He pushes it around for quite awhile. It didn't take him long to figure our that flipping it usually brings a reward. He seems disappointed when he flips it and there aren't any morsels on the floor, but he keeps at it. Great Product!

review/summary: Great
review/text: Bit loud on the tiles and due to the opening size there is only a few treats other than kibble we can put in. Hours of noisy entertainment for my smart Miniature Pinscher who finds a normal treat ball a little too easy. I also couldn't get the holes to open to adjust the difficulty, had to get someone else to figure it out and have not tried to adjust it since. Would not recommend for soft food as it's hard to get out and can easily get stuck.

review/summary: Great puppy fun
review/text: I wouldn't say that our puppy loves this item but it certainly keeps her amused. I think she is still figuring it out as all her other toys have been balls that she can roll around or shake. This one requires a bit more delicacy to get the food out and it takes a while to get all the food out. It is made of tough plastic and seems solidly constructed so should last for ages. I usually put about 1 cup of dry food in the large size cube and this seems to work well.<br /><br />I had some difficulty getting the inner cylinder out for the first time. I persisted and just as I was about to give up it popped out with seemingly no effort at all.

I've tried wrapping it with rubber bands to soften the roll but too little too late!<br /><br />Update... my dog's older brother loves it! He's a little bigger and is a total food whore so I thought he'd like it. He's just visiting but I'm sending it home with him and I think it's finally gonna get some great use!

review/text: the concept of the buster cube is great, it makes getting food fun for the dog. the only, yet very significant problem is that if you use it on hard floors it makes a ton of noise that's pretty much unbearable. and if you use it on a carpet it leaves crumbs. there are other products identical to the buster cube's purpose in dispensing food that way that are made of rubber.

review/summary: Dog Cube
review/text: I like the food cube except it's not as indestructible as I had hoped.  I have four dogs and I bought this toy to see if I could curb my lab mix from her destructiveness due to mild separation anxiety.  Well, one of the other dogs figured it out first and taught her, the only problem is that the other dog also figured out how to pick the cube up to get it out of corners and this broke one of the plastic tabs inside that help you screw on and off the lid by pick it up with one canine in the hole and the other on the outside edge of the cube.  My 40lb dog broke the tab so what's going to happen if I were to let the 100 pounder play with it?  Thought this would be more like a Kong and less like rawhide that is easily destroyed.

review/text: My golden retriever, Whisper, is very prone to anxiety when I leave the house. I just fill this cube with Cheerios, or even her regular serving of her dog food, and she goes to town rolling it on the floor to get every bit of treats from the cube. We both love it!<br />Word of caution: You need to have the cube in a room where there are no places for the cube to roll into and get stuck, like under couches or chairs. I have blocked off high bottomed chairs and couches so the cube does not get rolled into and stuck. My dog rolls this all around the room. I should spray her with Endust and have her clean up her hair while she is playing. KIDDING!

review/summary: Has potential, but my dog just didn't get it
review/text: I bought the Buster Food Cube to hopefully help with my Spaniel Mix's bad habit of woofing down her meals in a couple of seconds.  I got the cube and was anxious to fill it up, however, it took a while to fill it.  Once it was filled, I put it on the floor and kicked it around for her to help her figure out what she needs to do.  She ate the kibbles as they fell, but unfortunately she's not the brightest dog ever so all she did was lick the hole where the kibble falls out and has to be put in to fill.  I think she successfully knocked it over once or twice, but gave up shortly after that.<br /><br />I think overall the Buster Food Cube has potential to be a good product for a smarter dog.  As for me, I'll just have to keep looking for solutions.

review/summary: Buster Food Cube
review/text: We have been using this food cube for a few years and our black lab really likes the challenge.  It fits about 1.5 - 2 cups of food and usually takes about 5-10 minutes for our dog to get it all out.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Keeps him engaged and makes him earn his food.<br />Very durable design. Make sure your dog knows not to chew on the opening to get the food, but rather push it around.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It is a little loud with all the food rattling around.<br />Crumbs get into the carpet (vs feeding out of a bowl). We usually make him use it on tile flooring (louder).<br />It is tough to load.  We have been measuring the food into a cheap rubbermaid plastic bottle, and then shaking it through the mouth of the bottle into the cube.<br />I would like it to take longer to get the food out...<br /><br />It was a good purchase, but would need to be easier to load to get 5 stars.

review/summary: Good idea...POOR execution
review/text: We bought this (the large cube) for our eighty pound retriever. He played with it once, then it broke in half. I glued the halves back together, he played with it once more, then it broke in half again. I then put super epoxy on it and plastic-welded it back together. He played with it once, then it broke AGAIN. I finally drilled holes in the side and riveted a make-shift bracket to either half, effectively sealing the thing together for eternity (or as long as it takes for the plastic to break-down into it's constituent materials). Even now the center tube hardly "locks" anymore. I'm done with this toy. The manufacturer needs to redesign the cube halves so the halves screw together.<br /><br />Even when it was brand new the center lock was VERY hard for my wife to get out. I almost broke my thumb trying to do it myself. I finally had to jamb a towel into the hole, then stuff my finger into the towel and "wrench" on the part to get the cube to open.<br /><br />One star for construction and durability.<br />Three stars for the concept.<br /><br />Average: 2 stars

review/summary: Scared our dog
review/text: We fostered a dog and bought him a bunch of toys to keep him entertained while we were at work all day.  Some of the toys he loved, but this one scared him.  The plastic is think and hard, so when he would roll it from side to side it made a loud noise from the impact on our hard floors.<br /><br />I think it would work better with carpeted homes.  Also, it can be pretty tricky for dogs to get the treats out, so I would say this is an 'advanced' toy.

review/summary: Great toy for (the food modivated) dog!
review/text: This has been (of varying size) the favorite toy of each of the three dogs i've had.  Even the most recent rescue that doesn't care for toys.  Took a couple play sessions to teach her to use it, but once she got the idea, it's the only toy she gets excited to see.  Highly recommended.  Once they get it, it's easy to just take some (or all) of the meal kibble and let them work it out.  If your dog is having a hard time understanding it, I suggest trying two things that helped us out.  Add some Zukes minis (semi-moist) treats in with the dry kibble (the stronger scent got my dog interested after kibble alone didn't draw her to it) and practice play on a solid (preferably light colored) carpet that makes it easier to see the rewards spill out.  The regular size one was good for my small-medium dogs, and the mini is good sized for my little (14 lb) terrier mix.  Warning that the mini cube might not fit your kibble/treats if they're larger sized.  If you want to use the mini cube, have "small-bites" or toy-dog sized kibble on hand.  Happy play!

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: I got this for my dog about a week ago because he was eating his food too fast and too often wanted his humans to be his sole source of entertainment. Now we put about half his kibble in his bowl and the other half in his Buster cube. He goes to the cube periodically throughout the evening and doesn't need constant human entertainment. He caught on to the concept pretty quickly. I suspect with this type of item, either your dog will be into it, or he won't. There's not a lot of middle ground. The downside is the cube often gets stuck in corners or under furniture. Also, it doesn't evenly dispense food, so he'll get a lot of kibble in the first five minutes of play, then over the course of a few hours he only gets a few more. It's difficult to get the last few pieces out. he's only emptied it completely once. The cube is bigger than i expected; about the size of his (black lab) head. It's not especially easy to fill, as some kibble in inevitably remains in the shaft and thus falls out immediately. Despite the imperfections, the dog uses it and is entertained, so i consider it a success.

review/summary: The Best Food Cube I've Ever Tried
review/text: My Miniature Schnauzer is a gobbler, when it comes to eating.  She would then throw her food up.  She got Pancreatitis and the vet suggested that I feed her by hand, so that she didn't wolf her food down so fast. He also suggested that I feed her 3 times a day.  I found this Mini Cube, which I fill with her kibble and she has Crazy Fun rolling, knocking and hunting (I hide it and make her find it) for her meals.  She has not had any bouts with Pancreatitis or throwing up since I started feeding her this way.  It takes her about 20-30 minutes to eat each meal. And, she seems very satisfied when she is finished.<br /><br />It's great Exercise and since Schnauzers are hunters by nature, it keeps her mental alertness sharp!

review/text: I use this buster cube to feed one of my schnauzer's her breakfast each morning.  It entertains her for a good 30 minutes or so as she rolls it around and munches the kibble as it falls out.  Her first buster cube lasted 6 years (would have lasted longer if my second one, JoJo, hadn't chewed up the plug...), so chaos reigned in my house until we got the new buster cube.  Now it's a morning ritual again.<br /><br />This toy is extremely durable, easy to fill, and great fun for both you and your dogs.  I would heartily recommend it to be introduced to the pup before their first year is up, and you may have to, uh, demonstrate it.  Once the dog catches on, you'll enjoy watching them roll the buster cube around getting their kibble/treats from it.  This toy is worth the money, for sure!

review/summary: 4 month old ~6lbs puppy loves it
review/text: i have an alaskan klee kai puppy who is getting close to 5 months and MAYBE 6 pounds if i'm lucky -- she LOVES this thing. i initially got it bc she INHALES her food as if i've starved her for days, and wanted her to slow down and chew her food. well, it slows her down a little, but she still inhales. she even plays with it when there's nothing in it and it's still sitting around in her xpen or kennel. the only thing i absolutely hated about it was when it fell in her waterbowl (from her nosing it everywhere) water got stuck in the cube with some dry food and i couldnt get it out for the life of me. it took FOREVER to get the center piece out (i had to stop using it for a couple weeks since it was disgusting) and i finally read somewhere that someone used a screwdriver to kind of pull the piece out. i didn't hear anything when i did, but it came out somehow. now it's clean and stuffed with her meals :) just for this reason, i dont know if it really would be cleaned too well in a dishwasher, since it took a while to get water out of it completely for me when i was just trying to empty it out before i opened it. if you hate loud noises, probably should stay away from this one. also, the hard setting doesnt seem to be too hard for my puppy, so if you're looking for something SUPER slow, this one will only get you there for a few uses. however, i love it, and so does juneau, so definitely an easy 5 stars.

review/text: We have quite a few treat dispenser toys, and our 10 pound chihuahua mix LOVES food, so of course, she loves these toys. We feed her lunch and breakfast with the toys. Unfortunately, they were starting to get too easy for her. We have the large Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball, which she loves, but she gets the food out so quickly that we needed something more challenging. This mini classic buster cube fits her (and our) needs. Similar idea, but since it is more difficult for her to roll and move the cube, she has to play with it longer. So far, it is holding up well and she enjoys it. I highly recommend this toy if you want something more challenging for your dog.

review/summary: It SOUNDED like a good idea...
review/text: My vet recommended this toy for my dog Koko (terrier mix) b/c it would keep her distracted and away from destroying my things. I filled it with the dry dog food that she likes and showed her how to play with it, but she won't have anything to do with it! I tried chopping up a treat that she likes and using that, but it didn't get her interest either. Maybe it's just my dog, but I was dissappointed. I highly recommend getting your dog a Kong toy though, she never lets that thing go!

review/text: My dog loves his Buster Cube and so do I.  It keeps him busy and out of trouble.  He stopped chasing the cats and now pushes around his Buster Cube.

review/summary: Did not last one day
review/text: Ordered this product along with the Large Kong Wobbler Red toy for our 3 dogs (weight in at 45 to 65 lbs each). This item was hard to fill, hard to seal, and hard to clean. Found the toy on the lawn the next morning after the sprinklers drenched the dried dog food into a melted mess. The port and plug located on one side of the cube which you add kibble is about the size of my middle finger. Impossible to clean even with a bottle brush. I soaked the kibble out and refilled it to give the toy a 2nd chance. Found that the plug shaken loose from the port and I later discovered it chewed up. This render the toy useless. Would not by again. Still have the Kong Wobbler Red and refill it daily.

review/text: I bought this ball for my standard poodle. It didn't take him long before he was kicking it around & getting to the treats. He did become board with it.

review/summary: Unhygienic, But Fun For Dog
review/text: Our very smart, very small dog, who is a Papillon and Jack Russel mix, really enjoys this toy. However, I find it frustrating that the cube just won't come apart for cleaning as it is supposed to. We actually returned the first one we bought because it wouldn't open, but the replacement cube won't either. The hygiene issue is unpleasant for the owner--but I guess it's not such a big deal, since from the dog's point of view, clean things are less fun than dirty ones!

review/summary: Dog LOVES It !!
review/text: My parents have a dachshund and she LOVES this toy. It's the only toy she plays with. That dog has had this ball since she was a young dog and she is now 11 years old and still plays with it. After eight years (and much much use), the ball is finally starting to wear out. We've tried other balls to replace it, but she wants this one. I'm so glad I found the exact same ball for sale here, so she can have the kind of ball that she likes.

review/summary: Pets Treat Cube
review/text: I wouldn't buy this product again as it's too hard to open and insert the treats. It says to put your finger in and twist to open.  I gave it to my niece to open and she even had trouble.
