review/summary: MY NEW FAVORITE DRINK !!!
review/text: I used to be a strictly "morning coffee" person. NOT ANYMORE. Coming from TN/AL, I only drank tea in good 'ole Southern style: ICED and SWEET. But I jumped off the java wagon to try this as I love mandarin oranges and thought it sounded good. Well it's not good...it's WONDERFUL! Some days, I find myself having 2 or 3 cups; a couple in the morning and one at bedtime. The taste is perfectly blended with all 3 flavors equally represented. A bit sweet so some folks might even be able to enjoy it straight up. All-in-all, this is the best K-cup of ANY kind I've had thus far.

review/summary: Good flavor, but not tangy
review/text: I bought this tea because I absolutely love tangy lemons, and wanted a tasty tea that wouldn't keep me up all night.  Based on other reviews, I knew it would have a strong lemony flavor, but the tea is lacking some tanginess that would probably make it perfect.  Still, it is probably the best lemon tea I have had from a K-cup or tea bag.  Next time I will add some fresh drops of fresh lemon juice.  With the bit of honey I already added, it will be perfect.

The best thing of all, it helps prevent cavities as xylitol is antibacterial. I love the flavor and it lasts. My only complaint is that the gum becomes teensy as you chew it and then, of course, you need to add 2 or 3 more to the one already in your mouth-haha. Oh, and one other thing, as other reviewers may have noted, the flavor is real licorice, not anise or some lab created flavor. Enjoy.

review/summary: A great product in aiding digesting, dental problems, breath....
review/text: I first tried this gum about a month ago. First of all, it is sweetened with xylitol - a natural, plant derived sweetener. There is no aspartame or saccharin - common synthetic sweeteners in gums. This gum will not give you chemically induced migraines. Secondly, licorice has been used as for digestion, for centuries. It also sweetens the breath. Plus, the gum is also affective in preventing tooth decay (xylitol). I found that my stomach ache and cramps diminished after chewing this. So much better than many gums on the market, today. I recommend this highly!

It has a "thicker," more savory quality than some of<br />the other xylitol gums, and the licorice tastes natural, not chemical.  I love this product!

The beans are firm and the sauce is thick and zesty with just a little bite to it. One package amounts to a side dish for two; two packages could make it a main course. As a bonus, the heated product exudes a pleasant, slightly flowery aroma, a pleasant reminder of Indian restaurants for those of us who live in neighborhoods not yet blessed with any.

The fusilli is my favorite because it has bulk to it and doesn't easily slip off of a fork (the way penne can), but even their spaghetti is tasty and tender.  Follow the directions on the package and you can't go wrong.

review/summary: Better than the "normal" pasta I used to eat!
review/text: If you can't eat wheat pasta, Tinkyada is the brand to buy.  The white rice pasta I bought at the store was mushy and didn't hold its shape.  It was a pale imitation of the "real thing" (i.e. wheat pasta)  But Tinkyada's pasta I can enjoy eating.  As long as you cook according to the directions, you can't tell it's not "normal" pasta. I usually add a bit of oil to the water with the pasta to discourage sticking, because I don't do a very good job remembering to stir it!  It's also brown rice-based, so it's healthier for you.  One warning, if you put plain pasta in the fridge, it will be hardened when you pull it out.  But, heat it with some sauce, or reheat it in a pan of water on the stove, and it's nice and soft again.  If you store it with sauce, then this problem is avoided.<br /><br />I've tried four shapes of Tinkyada pasta, and this is definitely my favorite.  The fusilli is like a hollow spaghetti, with a slight twist to it.  With the interesting shape of spiral/rotini pasta, but without the bulkiness.  It seems very fancy, but doesn't really cost a whole lot more.  This is the shape we use most often.  We use it with marinara sauce, meat sauce, chicken parmesan, chicken noodle soup, etc.  Very versatile.  Highly recommended to anyone who can't eat wheat/gluten.

review/summary: Best rice pasta around
review/text: My wife is a celiac and I'm very picky about my pasta.  What to do?  We tried every dried rice pasta we could find, and Tinkyada has been hands-down the best.  The texture is excellent and it is much easier to cook to a proper al dente than any other brand.  It has good flavor.  I personally find the Fusilli form the most appealing.  Indeed, I actually prefer this pasta to just about any dried wheat-based pasta.  Heartily recommended without reservation.

review/summary: Never go wrong with Tinkyada GF pasta
review/text: I have NEVER been disappointed with Tinkyada gluten free pastas.  WE have tried several varieties and I have loved the performance of all of them.  (The lasagna noodles are the most difficult but that is not what this review is about.)<br /><br />I live at about 5000 feet above sea level and I cook the noodles in boiling water for the amount of time listed on the package.  I always set a timer and do not rely on "trying it" like I used to with semolina pastas.  When the timer goes off test the pasta and set timer for another minute if needed.  I never have to cook longer than the time listed on the bag.  The pasta holds shape perfectly and is an awesome addition to our gluten free pantry.  I love the gluten free variety offered by Tinkyada and the amazing prices offered on amazon.com!

review/summary: Great Flavor and Consistency
review/text: What a relief that Tinkyada rice pasta exists.  The other brands don't compare in flavor, consistency or the way that they cook. Most need to be rinsed several times after cooking in order not to be gloppy, but we don't find this with Tinkyada.<br /><br />Because we're purchasing this for children, we're so pleased that Tinkyada offers several different shapes of pasta.  Often, I can cook the same shape of rice pasta and classic pasta for my husband.  My only hope is that Tinkyada will add even more...farfalle, Tinkyada??<br /><br />Great product, and amazon offers the best price.  Hopefully, it will one day be offered as a s&s item.

review/summary: Best Pasta (but poor package cooking directions)
review/text: Firstly, I buy Tinky noodles at my grocery for 3.10/package, so the price offered here is not as good.  They are the best noodles when properly cooked - I boil them for 7 minutes then drain and eat.  I like a noodle with some "chew" to it and I often reheat leftovers in the microwave (when I plan to do that I cook the noodles for 5 minutes) They will get MUSHY if you cook according to package directions (and who wants that unless you're missing teeth?).  I serve these noodles both hot and cold to family and guests and receive only compliments.  Being gluten-free (choice, not celiac) I also notice they digest far better than pasta, which tends to bloat and expand.  And that means I can eat more, because I love them.  Buy them and cook them right!

review/text: Tinkyada makes the best gluten-free pasta I have tasted, and I like the fusilli the best.  They are not at all gritty or mushy, like many gluten-free pastas tend to be.  This pasta is best if you cook it using the "energy-saving method" described on the front of the package, and I only cook it for 3/4 of the time listed (15 minutes).  This way, you get a truly al dente pasta -- and you won't even miss the wheat!

I recently went on a flourless diet and thought I was done with pasta for life but when someone recommended I try your product I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did.  I bought the Tinkyada Brown Rice Fusilli packages and have shared with friends.  I am anxious to try more varieties and make some old familiar recipes with a pasta that works on my particular diet plan.  I used the quick and easy cooking method and it worked perfectly.

review/summary: Gluten Free?  You'll love this!
review/text: I've known I need to remain gluten free for over 25 years now, and have tried many, many gluten free products to get as close to the old "normal" days as I can.  The bottom line is that my wife and I purchase the Tinkyada products almost exclusively when we buy pasta (she eats it too despite not having to be gluten free).  And getting it from Amazon make it far easier too, since we can't find most of their products in our reasonably large city - we have to drive 100 miles to the REALLY big city.  So for about the same cost, minus tax, minus travel or shipping, we get it direct and avoid extra expenses.<br /><br />As for the product, this is as good as any "regular" pasta I ever had in my "past life."  There's far less stickiness, and it holds up well for leftovers the next day.  It is not mushy or relatively tasteless like some of the other brands of gluten free pasta we've had in the past.<br /><br />When we give 5 stars, it's because it stands out as superior.  A really good product "only" gets a 4-star rating from us.  This one's a definite 5.

review/summary: Pricey but superb!
review/text: This is the best gluten-free pasta I have ever purchased, HANDS DOWN.<br /><br />It's firm and holds up to stirring with a spoon while it's cooking, and it's really delicious. I tastes like very high quality traditional pasta. My only complaint is that it's expensive. Compared to regular pasta, it's like 5 times more expensive. But if you have gluten senstivity, or if you prefer a brown rice pasta (healthier alternative) it is the BEST one on the market.<br /><br />I bought this one and the elbow, and both were equally good. So I assume that all of the brown rice pasta by this company is going to be good.<br /><br />It also takes a little longer to cook-- about 17 minutes. And you should stir it frequently so that it cooks evenly. But I don't see these as a drawback-- just an FYI.  It really does taste very good.

review/text: Taste.. 3 stars.<br />Yes, strong with a kick, but to my taste buds very, very bitter. Might be the guarana but the bitterness is very difficult to overcome regardless of brew cup size (I've tried 5,7 and 9 ounces so far).<br /><br />I like the smoothness and strength of Kona and the strength of Revv does equal that of the Kona but it is not smooth. I occasionaly add hazelnut non-dairy creamer as a sweet treat to my coffee and the bitterness still comes through over the hazelnut creamer.<br /><br />My latest on the go experiment that seems to make it more palate tolerant, is brewing 7 ounces of Revv and adding 5 ounces of a milder medium roast coffee to it in the travel cup.

review/summary: Bad after-taste
review/text: We tried a box of these K-Cups in our office, and 5 out of 5 people, myself included, couldn't get past the after-taste.  It was so bad that we even turned down our supplier's offer to give us a 2nd free sample box of k-cups.<br /><br />We all agreed that the idea of super-coffee sounded great, but we couldn't get past the after-taste.  The first sip was good, and I would probably have given it 3 or 4 stars... but then the after-taste kicked in.  Maybe it's the Ginseng or maybe it's the Guarana, but whatever it is...it's bitter and kind of chemically-tasting.<br /><br />One co-worker added flavored creamer, and it was tolerable, but not good enough to accept a 2nd box free.<br /><br />Our box did not include any over-packed or poorly sealed cups, as the other reviewer experienced, although we have experienced that from time to fime with other manufacturers.

Half of the cups had broken seals and dripped grounds into the cup.  I saw that on the reviews before I ordered, but I figured it had to be a one time thing and would be fixed by the time I got mine.<br />I was wrong.<br /><br />What I have learned in the past to do when the seal on the K-cup is broke is to wrap a small piece of foil over the top  before putting it in the coffee maker.  The foil puts enough extra pressure on the cup to keep the seal.  No big deal when its one cup out of 100.  But when its half the cups in the order its a bit of a pain.

review/text: I have ordered and not received yet but I'm a little worried. Some say its horrible and bitter, some say its great.. strong and not bitter. Which is it? I guess I'll find out soon. Maybe a resell on Ebay. Stay tuned ......I'll review once I receive.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received the coffee and while it's not horrible it does have sort of a bitter after taste especially first thing in the morning. I drink it black so I can easily distinguish it. I will say that it definitely gives you a major boost so if you can get by the slight bitterness it will do the trick.<br /><br />I had a cup when I first got home from work and did not notice the bitterness as much as I did in the morning and it gave me a nice pick me up. I actually watched a movie until 11:30 and did not fall asleep on the couch by 10:00 as I usually do.<br /><br />It's worth keeping around for the kick and maybe mix with my regular Starbucks House Blend but I can't see ordering it again. Maybe just the REVV would be better.<br /><br />FURTHER UPDATE: Its starting to grow on me and while it may be a little rough for breakfast it really does give you a nice boost. If you like a bold coffee you will like this.<br /><br />- Rick

review/text: Being a shift worker, I need a kick butt, good tasting coffee on wake up, no matter what time of the day that is.  Revv fits that bill.  If you need a bold, rich full bodied coffee to get you going in the morning, this is it.

review/summary: Good Tasting Coffee
review/text: I love a good strong cup of morning coffee and this one comes as close to perfect as one can.  I usually set my machine to make a mug of coffee & the first cup I had of this brew tasted just a little stronger that my usual one.  I then dropped the cup size down one notch, made a second cup and found what I was looking for.  Tried my usual coffees with the smaller cup & they did not compare to the rich aroma & fine taste that I'm now getting with Revv

review/text: I love this coffee! I just need one cup now to wake me up in the morning and I have found that regular coffee just doesn't do it for me anymore. I don't feel jittery either. It is strong tasting but I like the taste of coffee so I don't mind that.

review/summary: Love, Love , Love Revv Pulse!
review/text: I ordered regular Revv not knowing if it was all a gimmick and was very pleased with the coffee. I work overnights so I figured the Revv Pulse would be a plus so why not try it! Wow, this K-Cup really delivers on taste and yes it did give me a boost! I cant fake the funk at work all night and a couple cups of Revv Pulse (over ice with creamer is my preffered way to enjoy coffee) had me alert and awake for my whole shift! Both Revv & Revv Pulse are strong coffees so if you are looking for something light this isnt it. Its bold but not bitter which is what I enjoy and stands up great against a full glass of ice. I wasnt able to taste anything strange or any type of herbal tastes. I am very happy with both my Revv & Revv Pulse purchases. Side note: I bought Revv Pulse here through Amazon only because both Green Mountain and Keurig.com are sold out of it at the moment. Its cheaper by almost 10.00 on the other sites.

review/summary: Watch out for Defective Cups!!
review/text: I LOVE this coffee.  Unfortunately, I have a box and a half that will never get used.  Why?  Because I bought them and 4 out of the first 10 cups used blew open inside my Keurig brewer, blowing hot water and coffee grounds all over the inside of my brewer and all over my countertop.<br /><br />I can't say what the problem was - maybe I just got a bad batch of K-Cups, but for there to be that many defective cups in one box was very odd.  I've never, ever had that happen with any other K-Cups by Green Mountain or any other company.<br /><br />Anyone wanna buy a box and a half of these?  :-)

review/summary: Simply the Best!!! From a happy ALO Junkie!!!
review/text: I was lucky enough to have been in Hawaii last summer- where i first discovered this amazing drink! At first- i was a little freaked out when i tasted the Aloe pulp ( as i was not expecting that); but after enjoying my very first bottle- i was automatically hooked on the taste, the benefits with the aloe; and i could not drink enough of it.<br /><br />Then- to my dismay- upon returning to Montreal, Canada where I live; I could not find it anywhere!!! The only places that I could find it online were in other provinces- and they would not ship to Montreal. (nor was it cost efficient for me)<br />Then a month ago- I was shopping in one of our largest grocery stores (IGA Select) and found it in their health section....but at over $3.50 for a small bottle- as much as I liked it- it was a little steep.<br /><br />Then I found it on Amazon- probably at the best price you can find anywhere; and even with free shipping. (They dont ship to Canada either- but I have it shipped to a USA address and a friend brings it home for me. This friendly service costs me a few bottles for sure- but well worth it!!!)<br /><br />My fridge is happily stocked with an assortment of ALO flavors; and needless to say-I have been, and will continue to; order a case or more per month!<br /><br />I am very much looking forward to trying their new flavors!!!

review/summary: Too good to be real!
review/text: These drinks are delicious and very quenching!  I've only been drinking 2 a day for 2 days, but I swear it has helped my stomach and digestive tract.  My painful inflammation caused by A.S seems to be greatly reduced also, which is not normal for me.  I bought my drinks in a Calgary Macs store for around $2.85 a bottle including tax and deposit.  Could be a little cheaper, but I only say that because I want to drink it by the truckload, and can't afford that kind of a habit.  As for the small chunks of aloe in them, I personally think that is what makes the drink so good for you, and I really enjoy them.

The slightly sweet and tart flavor of magosteen and mango really adds to the quenching palate. A long term fan!

review/summary: My personal FAVORITE!
review/text: I've tried all the Alo brand flavors and this one, in my personal opinion, is by FAR the best. It has a perfect taste of Mango and Mangosteen (which I had never heard of before), but it is quite personally addicting (just the right amount of sweetness. The pulp in the drink is also very soft and goes down smooth. You could literally open the cap and down the whole bottle in 2 or 3 gulps, it's that good!<br /><br />Not sure what the cost is on here since the item is currently out of stock, but out here in Hawaii where I live you can usually find this for about $1.59 a bottle. I wouldn't pay more than that unless you have no other options.<br /><br />5 stars for being so addicting!

review/summary: Another wonderful brew from Coffee Masters
review/text: Another hit from Coffee Masters.  Not overly oily like some flavored coffee companies make, but still the same flavor. Again, a pretty good sale, $18 for 4 bags of beans. Doesn't make as good an iced cup, but more than makes up for it with a normal brew. Smooth, creamy but not overpowering. Works out to 3# of coffee for $18, still a good deal for flavored coffee.
