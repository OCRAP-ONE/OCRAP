review/text: My dog loves these, perfect size, and he is always looking with longing at the bag. They also aren't very messy, as the bone is very soft, it still does not create a lot of small crumbs, but rather large chunks that get eaten up. So far, it seems to be healthy, and I try to give him one a day, or every other day. So far, Amazon has the best prices that I've found on these.

review/summary: Josie's favorit bone
review/text: Josie's my four year old black and will not part with her nylabone. She has it in her mouth most of the time and will not play with any other bone or toy. I bought the bright green one so when it lands in the grass or weeds it's easy to find. When she runs out of the house with her bone and drops it God only knows where,guess who has to find it? Yes it's me her mom. That's why I'm so happy I bought the bright green one because it's easy to spot. This is the very best dog bone on earth because it's VERY STRONG and will not come apart which is the best for your dog. Your best friend will love it. Just like we love them.

review/text: Love, love, love fenugreek sprouts. Package arrived quickly. I soak my sprouts in a bit of liquid kelp which tends to sweeten up the sprouts while adding trace minerals. These fenugreek seeds take a few days to sprout, and always turn my sprout bags golden yellow :-) but they are so god mixed in a bean salad, or tossed into a tofu dish or just eating on a salad. I always have a few bags of fenugreek sprouting.

review/summary: Requires additional ingredients to swallow
review/text: I'm a huge fan of Red Mill products -they're made just around the corner from where I live, so I stop in their retail store all the time. I bought the whey through Amazon because it was a couple bucks cheaper than the retail price. I hoped to use it as a replacement to bodybuilding whey protein supplements that have a bunch of other ingredients - glucosamine, creatine, sugars, etc. I give big points to Red Mill for being simple and pure, and it's important to note they are selling a base whey protein concentrate, not a protein shake mix. It dissolves relatively well into water but not as well as leading protein drinks. The taste is what's sticking in my craw - it has a very raw, difficult to overcome flavor. It's like swallowing thin wallpaper paste (consistency) that has a strong, flat taste of the milky liquid that forms in cottage cheese containers. If you're planning to mix recipes like other reviewers recommend (adding apple juice, or spinach(?), or bananas and other fruit), you'll be fine. But be aware this is not drinkable on it's own - it requires strong flavors blended with it. I'm using it in my steel cut oatmeal in mornings, and I'll cook with it, but it looks like I'll need to stick with flavored protein shakes for meal supplementation.

review/summary: Nice taste
review/text: Blends well in smoothies. Taste is, to me, neutral which is a plus for whey. Difficult to find plain whey from "Sports" sources and when I have the taste is not pleasant. The others do contain whey isolate which is supposed to be superior so perhaps that is the difference. Elderly relative was drinking bottled  nutritional mixes (Ensure etc) when she felt bad or had trouble keeping food down. They helped but smoothies are better. Make them  with whey, egg whites (Deb-El Just Whites here on Amazon sells whites in smaller packages), natural chocolate (Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Cacao Powder), bananas and other fruit. She loves them. The whey and eggs whites give her all the protein she needs in a day in one drink (the egg whites lighten up the drink too but aren't really necessary unless you really want a protein boost). On bad days when she can't eat solid food, I toss in a few tablespoons of Deb-El powdered whole eggs to add fat and boost her caloric intake.

review/summary: Great natural alternative to "designer" protein powders
review/text: This product is packaged well (it comes in a display box with the four packages) and was just what I was hoping for.  It sits nicely in my pantry.<br /><br />I was looking for a natural alternative to commercially marketed and artificially sweetened protein powders and this fits the bill perfectly.  I use it for making smoothies and the taste is a bit bland but I add one tablespoon organic honey and it gives it just the right amount of sweetness.<br /><br />For a great tasting smoothie with this product mix 1/4 c. apple juice, 1/4 c. soymilk, one handful spinach (yes spinach, you don't even taste it in the smoothie and it will give you a great energy boost), 1 T. flaxseeds, 1 T. organic honey, 1 cup berries, 1 sml banana, ice, and 1/4 c. Bob's Mill Whey Protein Powder Concentrate.  Mix in blender until smooth.  Ultra good for you and delicious to boot!

review/summary: Great taste, dissolves well, what more do you want?
review/text: I bought this as an addition to add to my protein shakes that I make everyday. I use half whey protein, half soy protein (since the soy has a tendency to clump, not dissolve, or taste awful if used entirely) and this is just awesome.<br /><br />The taste is mild and milky, not artificial tasting at all. When used entirely it tastes more like a milkshake, not a protein shake. I add a teaspoon (more on some days) of Medaglia D' Oro Instant Espresso Coffee when I make my shakes and the taste of the whey protein totally disappears, so if you don't like the taste you can easily hide it by adding a wide range of flavors. Even adding a cup of vanilla yogurt hides the flavor.<br /><br />It dissolves very well in water, milk, and even soy milk, no clumping whatsoever!<br /><br />This is whey protein in it's simplest form with nothing added, so if you are like me and watch what you put into your body, this is a definite must have pantry item.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great taste (well at least I like it)<br />Dissolves well in a variety of liquids<br />Cooks well without adding any unwanted flavor<br />4g of protein per tablespoon<br /><br />Cons:<br />None!

review/text: Great product. No sugar added which is a real plus. This way I can sweeten if I choose to using the sweetener of MY choice. Great to add to mac n' cheese sauce or other sauces which gives kids (and adults) added protein to their food without altering taste. Makes great fruit smoothies too. Some of my grandchildren don't like to eat meat, so this is a great way to get protein into their meal. My family has no clue all the things that I have added this to. Now I don't worry if they are getting enough protein in their diet.

review/summary: Excellent for low-carb baking.
review/text: Bob's Red Mill Whey Protein Concentrate stands out among the many protein powders I have experimented with over the years as the purest, best tasting, and best textured. Whey protein (as opposed to soy) is hard to find in a pure form, but Bob's is unadulterated with artificial sweeteners, texturizers, flavorings, etc. It performs brilliantly in low-carb flour replacement mixtures, adding a strechy, spongy, texture that I frankly have not been able to duplicate without a wheat product otherwise in years of trying. Because it is simply the unflavored protein, it is versatile, too; you're not limited to sweet or savory applications. If you bake low-carb, give Bob's a shot! I hope you will be as delighted as I have been!

I take it to ensure I am having enough complete proteins daily, on top of soy and egg proteins. I like the fact that it has no additives or artificial flavors - I preferred it over the several products that are popular but have 'tastemaker' chemicals or flavors or chocolate added. I just wanted whey protein, and that is what it is. I had set my subscription to once every 3 months - now I have it once every 2 months.

Spending $13 for one package at my local organic and health food store is quite pricey...sorry guys.<br /><br />I use this practically everyday as a protein shake after a workout or simply as an in between meal snack. What I like most is that there are no additive flavors, just straight whey here with very little taste. So making your favorite smoothies is wonderful for those seeking higher protein in their diet. I usually use a 1/2 cup of frozen fruit(bananas, strawberries, or blueberries), a cup of milk, a tablespoon of grounded flax, some honey if desired and 2 tablespoons of whey. Sometimes I will use 1/2 cup of plain yogurt in which I will cut back to 1/2 cup of milk. Blend and you have yourself a highly nutritious food shake.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/summary: Heartburn.
review/text: I have made several shakes with cocoa powder, whey, agave syrup, and non-fat milk (my normal mixture) and ended up with heartburn.  I have used another natural brand of whey with these same ingredients for months with no problems, so I suspect this brand might be the culprit.  It does mix well.

review/summary: Now this is white CHOCOLATE.
review/text: These are vegan, dairy-free.  Very tasty.  I had only ever had the white chocolate that uses dairy cream and whey, and I thought I hated "white chocolate" and wondered why they called it chocolate.  Well here is why... because white chocolate should be made with cocoa butter.  Then it is truly white chocolate.  And it doesn't have that dairy flavor; it has a very mild chocolate flavor.  These chips melted down well and also went back to solid at room temp.

review/summary: Veganocity: check!
review/text: I really hope I can continue to purchase this product on Amazon. Vegan white chocolate chips are really hard to come by, unless you shop at places like VeganEssentials.com (which gets pricey at times). Trying to make your own vegan white chocolate is a little tedious. Real cocoa butter is delicious, but fussy and melty. This white chocolate coats and hardens like conventional white chocolate. That comes in handy for things like cake pops, chocolate covered fruits and homemade frosted circus cookies. I will keep this stuff stocked in my pantry!

review/summary: great alternative for dairy-allergic kids (and grown-ups).
review/text: We've used these to make chocolate lollipops. It is a little slower to melt, but works very well and solidifies with a shiny sheen. It is very sweet, like all white chocolate, and it appears to be one of only two brands of dairy-free white chocolate, both kosher from Jerusalem. Probably most candy makers know this, but in case you are a newbie like me, we tried to use natural food coloring (with an ionized water base) and it makes the chocolate seize up. But, on its own (or probably with a gel-based food coloring), it works great.

review/summary: Delicious!  Great for GFCF kids!
review/text: FANTASTIC!!! These little chips are sweet and melt in your mouth.  A great choice for cooking projects that require chocolate that melts easily.  The palm gives it SUCH a mellow flavor :)<br /><br />It is so hard to make exciting treats for kids on a GFCF diet... until you really get going on it, that is!  My kids have been thriving on a GFCF diet for 3 years now.  Every year they tolerate sugar a little better, so we have been experimenting with different recipes involving sweets.  Last night we used these with our whirly gig kettle corn popcorm maker (that we LOVE) and we made white chocolate/cinnamon/raisin/kettle corn, it was sweet and salty and delicious.<br /><br />I can't wait to make homeade white chocolate lollipops!  And experiment with a recipe on the (also gfcf) rice chex box!<br /><br />If you can't tolerate dairy, these chips are definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Literally the worst white chocolate I have ever tasted
review/text: I was very excited to read the terrific reviews about these white chips and ordered the three pack. When they arrived, and I opened the first package, I was profoundly disappointed, these are easily the worst white chocolate I have ever tasted. The texture is hard and waxy, like cold margarine. There is almost no vanilla flavor, they are too sweet and the overall impression is horrid. The second ingredient after sugar is vegetable fat, and it shows, the chips are not smooth and do not readily melt, giving the mouth feel of cold margarine. I wonder if the other reviewers have never tasted superb white chocolate, because I cannot understand how anyone could rank them 5 stars.<br /><br />I threw them out.<br /><br />Perhaps in the panoply of kosher, vegan, lactose-free white chips these rank well, but compared to actual white chocolate, they are inedible, even the cheap packages of Nestle's white chips at the grocery store are far better.

review/text: These are a tasty bite indeed!<br />The ingredients list is short and simple. Unlike a lot of other shelf stable, processed foods, there isn't a single ingredient in this that you couldn't buy from the organic foods market.<br /><br />If you are looking for anything close to restaurant quality, well...go to a restaurant.  For something that can be dumped out of a shelf stable pouch and microwaved, its more than palatable.<br />It's nowhere near as chunky as it looks on the pouch, but there are still plenty of veggie and paneer bits in there.<br />One important thing to note is that it's very high in sodium.  So its best eaten over plain white rice (at least I think it's delicious that way)

My only "negative" was that I noticed more caffeine "jolt" than other brands so next time I want to try their decaffeinated product. Other than that, I couldn't be happier with Community Iced Tea Blend and highly recommend it!

review/summary: My Little Tree
review/text: I couldn't believe that Amazon sold bonsai trees. I just got an urge to try my hand at one, and started looking around on the internet for recommendations of where to buy one. And I thought, well, I buy so many other things from Amazon, I'll try there. Sure enough, they had several to choose from. Starting at the least expensive one, I saw that other purchasers had liked what they got here, so I ordered one for myself. I still couldn't believe that I could by a tree this way. But it arrived a few days later, was in great shape, well packed and looked like a really good start on my Bonsai effort for under $10. I've had it now for about a week, put it in a nice pot with some nice potting soil and all is well. It's going to be a while before it's large enough to really work with. But I'm happy and on my way.

review/summary: Bonsai delivery
review/text: I wanted to start growing a Bonsai and couldn't find any at the local stores in my area. So, I went to Amazon and found this. It didn't take very long to send and when it got here I was a bit skeptical. It seemed that the plant I was given was very bare and looked like a poor attempt at what is in that picture above. Of course, after time, none of this mattered. I've had this for around 2 months now and It has shaped up something gorgeous! Not every plant can arrive looking perfect and that's something you have to understand. But, if you order this juniper starter tree, I guarantee (with a little pruning and time) you'll have yourself a professional looking bonsai!

review/text: I received my starter Bonsai tree today, and was pleasantly surprised. The Bonsai came well packaged, and tucked safely inside the box was a robust, healthy starter tree. It came with detailed care instructions too. The older Bonsai trees can be quite expensive, so I thought I would try this starter Bonsai, and I am glad that I did. I had fun shopping for a Bonsai pot to transplant it to. If you want to try growing and shaping your own Bonsai tree, then I recommend this little starter tree.

review/text: The tree came in a box surrounded by those Styrofoam eggshell things and in great condition. No brown, a nice bright green color with tape over the sides of the plastic pot to prevent dirt from falling out.<br /><br />I planted it and it looks very nice.<br /><br />I will say that my tree looks better than the picture. Instead of having just one cascading part my tree has two and it looks very good. It seems healthy and for this price I wouldn't buy anything different. Fast shipping too.<br /><br />It is not small like some reviewers said, it is actually just as big as the picture. Not that I don't believe them, it just wasn't the case with my tree.

review/summary: Please offer this by the case through Subscribe&Save!
review/text: First a comment about pricing:  if the price listed here ($14.97) is for ONE box of 20 bags, then it's outrageously overpriced.  Maybe it's really for a case of 6 boxes of 20 bags each, in which case the price would be excellent.  But the description doesn't say that.<br /><br />In any case, the tea itself is wonderful, and you can buy it for less elsewhere on Amazon.<br /><br />This tea is delicious either hot or cold. Its aroma is so rich and soothing that it would be worth brewing even if you didn't drink it.<br /><br />So many of us want this year-round that I wish Amazon would make it available through Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />If only Celestial Seasonings would ALSO make a decaff version of this tea, I could enjoy it in the evening as well. (I'm super-sensitive to caffeine). But at least this "regular" version is a great start to my day.<br /><br />Since I sometimes have trouble finding Nutcracker Sweet at a reasonable price, I occasionally "stretch" it by brewing it thus: 1 bag of Nutcracker Sweet + 1 bag of PG Tips + 3 cups of boiling water. The two teas complement each other very nicely.<br /><br />When it's iced, sweetened with Xylitol (which dissolves best while the tea is still warm), and laced with a bit of milk or Half & Half, it satisfies me more than most desserts. I even know some people who add a drop of Irish Cream....

I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/text: Truly the best in a field of excellent salts.  Maldon uses a unique process of wood fires and channeled salt water to produce a light, flaky sea salt that both crunches and melts in your mouth.  Worth every penny.

review/summary: Lovely flakes of sea salt
review/text: There are many different varieties of sea salt out there.  What makes Maldon unique is its large, pyramidal flakes.  Some people use it for general cooking, but it really shines best as a finishing salt.  That means cook with less salt, but sprinkle salt on the finished dish.  You really get a chance to experience the unique characteristics (primarily texture) of each salt that way, and Maldon has a light crunch that I find very pleasant.<br /><br />Some people claim to be able to taste the difference between salts, but as long as there are no additives, I find all sea salts taste the same.  The pleasant texture and relatively reasonable cost make Maldon an excellent choice.<br /><br />Regardless of whether or not you buy this salt, try tasting a standard table salt next to a sea salt.  The iodine and anti-caking agents have a distinct and unpleasant bitterness.  If you're not willing to get spendy on sea salt, at least find a salt with no additives, something like Diamond Crystal Kosher salt.
