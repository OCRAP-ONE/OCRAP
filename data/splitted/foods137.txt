review/summary: Newman's Own IS Newman's Best
review/text: I use many Newman's Own products and I was glad to see Newman's Own Coffee K-Cups. I use K-Cups and I like bold coffee so I tried Newman's Own Bold. I  really like it. It makes a strong cup of coffee. I drink this round the clock, whenever I want a cup of coffee. I guess you can say, I am kind of a round-the-clock coffee drinker. Newman's Own Bold is very good.

As for Sam's Club, yes, Newman's is less expensive there, but we now live two-three hours to the nearest store, so Amazon is a good second choice as I would spend the difference in gas alone.

review/summary: My daily driver
review/text: This was the first coffee I tried on a Keurig.  At first I wasn't a fan.  Then I tweaked the cup size a bit and found a nice blend.  I personally like this on the 10oz setting.  This gives the best balance of flavor and fullness.  The key here is this is a medium roast, even though it is listed as 'bold', it is more of a medium through and through.<br /><br />The flavors are good.  There is a nice tail on this one.  It is a tiny bit on what I consider to be the tart side.  Not necessarily bitter though.  However, I am the only one in my family still drinking this one.  They've all moved on to the dark roast all the time.  For me, I like slightly less strength for my first cup of the day.  Yes, I do drink 3 cups a day... So there is still plenty of time for the stronger cups later on.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o flavor<br />o smooth tail<br />o great for 10oz or less<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit on the tart side<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this coffee for smaller cup sizes.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out it tastes wonderful too. The aroma in itself is calming and the lavender and slight anis flavors are just incredible. It combines the benefits of great flavor,  being really calming without putting you to sleep,  and easing tummy troubles like bloating and indigestion. It is a truly enjoyable tea. I just bought 6 boxes and am about to stock up on some more.

I have been using the calming and bedtime teas for the past 2 weeks and I have to say that even though I still get quite mad, I do feel that I have been calmer and not as snappish as I was. The flavors are delicious, especially with honey. I also suffer from gastrointestinal issues and it hasn't really helped in that respect, though....but I'm on some Crohn's level issues. I must say that it has helped with the severe tension headaches that work and kid give me daily, especially when trying to go to sleep. It is nice to be able to use a natural product to help myself with my anger management problems instead of loading up on medications.

The magnesium really does calm down the nervous system, and don't drink coffee at 11 a.m., but since I found Bedtime Tea, I don't go anywhere without it.  I order 6-12 boxes at a time.  Good Stuff.

review/summary: A complex flavor that seems to offer relaxation
review/text: Yogi Tea's offer high quality tea that taste wonderful.  They offer more complex flavors than traditional grocery store brands, and by purchasing them online, you get excellent prices.  My favorite teas of theirs are Calming and Bedtime.  Both seem to offer wonderful side effects of the feelings of relaxation.<br /><br />If you are not a big tea drinker these are still worth a try.  The flavors are complex and unique.  They are not a single note tea.  I have found these teas to never be bitter, and they are quite good without adding extras to make them taste better.<br /><br />I also like the lovely packaging, and the fortunes included on each tea bag.  I have found their blends to be unique and while I generally prefer bulk tea, that these are my favorite bagged teas.  If you looking for a tea that will help take the load off, give this one a try.

review/summary: GREAT tea!
review/text: I am a big fan of Yogi tea. They make great stuff. Always very high quality ingredients, very tasty blends. This is one of the 5-star varieties. Although it lists itself as chamomile and lavender, the flavor is predominantly a nice licorice, which combined with the other ingredients, is more like anise. It is also a moderately sweet tea. I'd call this a 'rich and full-bodied' herbal tea. And, although I'm not a big "traditional remedy" person, there do seem to be some real benefits to this and Relaxed Mind. However, it might be as much due to the enjoyment of a nice hot, flavorful cup of tea, as it is due to the herbs in the tea.<br /><br />Either way, the tea is full of flavor, and relaxing. Enjoy!

I'm a Queen of Amazon.com Prime and receive requests all the time to write reviews on the millions of products I order (how many people know all their delivery guys by their first names?) SO, with that said--Yogi Calming Tea is the BEST calming tea for me because of the FLAVOR. There are a lot of Chamomile teas in the world and all of them give me the calming effect; but, the flavor--EH? This is the one and only one I actually like--maybe it's the addition of lavender?  Do your own taste test and see if you like the difference. I couldn't find Yogi's Calming Tea for a while in my markets so today when it popped up on Amazon.com, I was thrilled!  I subscribed to the auto-ship and save program so I will never be out of it again-HOORAY!

review/summary: Mexican is quite good
review/text: Real Mexican chocolate of any version will be much better than mass produced American chocolate simply because the cocoa content is much higher (as w/ European chocolate). This is REAL dark chocolate w/ a little spice and sugar. I do not think it requires any additional sugar when I make it since I want the dark chocolate flavor. I use a whisk and it comes out delicious. I think this is one of the best products Nestle makes and about the only one I consistently purchase. In fact I'm going to try the powder mix version for convenience, but since the chocolate will be further processed, it probably won't be as good. However, it also received positive reviews.

review/text: I'm angry that I didn't try this sooner.  It beats the pants off of the powdered stuff in pre-measured packets, that's for sure!  I love the hint of cinnamon.  When I made the first batch, I thought that it may have a grainy feel, because it looks a little grainy, but it does not have a grainy mouthfeel at all.  My husband was hesistant (he thinks cinnamon smells like armpits (???)), but anyway, he was in love with it, too.  Wish I would have tried this many years ago!

review/summary: My kids love this
review/text: From Nestle comes Abuelita an excellent hot chocolate for those Fall and Wintry days.  This is sugared dark chocolate with a hint of cinnamon.  Each box comes with six tablets.  The best way to serve is to heat four cups of milk, break up one tablet, put milk and chocolate in blender, and blend approximately one minute.  I have the standard powdered hot chocolate in the cupboard but my kids seem to go for the Abuelita first.  They add one broken tablet and milk into the Cocomotion and in a few minutes they are in hot chocolate heaven.  Abuelita has a homemade dark chocolate taste that is not found in most conventional powdered brands.  This a product that is well worth keeping on hand for those hot chocolate days.

review/text: I have never used this to make a hot chocolate drink, but it is my favorite chocolate to use in cookies.  Chopped into chunks and mixed in the dough, it stands in for normal chocolate chips beautifully.  The slightly grainy texture comes through the baking perfectly intact and creates a wonderful contrast with the chewy cookie.  Try it!  It's wonderful.

review/text: A couple years ago, my husband pointed this cocoa out to me.  He hadn't tried it, but he'd always been amused by the granny's mischievous smile.  Since he'd been trading smirks with Abuelita for so long, I insisted we try it, and we haven't looked back.  Made with milk, the cocoa has a full flavor complemented by a nice, spicy accent.  Everything else now tastes bland by comparison.

review/text: I had the pleasure to taste the real deal in Mexico.  I loved it.  When I came home I sought out the real deal here in the states, I guess I did not look very far but I did come up with this pretty good substitute.  I also like the other brand of Mexican chocolate, I tried them side by side and they are almost exactly the same.<br />I love the texture and I often, more than not, eat it just the way it is right from the package.  But to make a good Mexican cocoa you need to use a paddle and put the chocolate in the cup, pour over the hot milk and paddle it till it is melted and foamy.  You do not need to microwave it, yuck!  You do not have to put it in the blender, Mexican people, for the most part, do not use blenders for their hot cocoa.  I buy it at the store it is too expensive here.

So even though I'd never tried coconut sugar before, I was intrigued about how it tasted.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised, as it tastes like a mild brown sugar, and most importantly I don't feel a sugar spike after eating it.<br /><br />I've put it in my organic coffee (yummy!), and cooking with it seems to work just fine (the company says to use it 1 to 1 as a replacement for sugar in recipes).<br /><br />I like that this company uses the profits to support the economy of small farmers in Indonesia. Good karma and great taste!<br />Recommended!

I immediately went on a search for the product and finally found it in the gourmet section of a local grocery.  Then, I found it on Amazon... and a LOT less expensive!  BREATHE DEEP tea has not only helped me with my respiratory issues (asthma, bronchitis, chronic sinus congestion, etc.), I've shared it with family members and friends who are also amazed at what one cup of BREATHE DEEP tea can do.  I'm getting ready to order my supply for the upcoming winter.  I do NOT want to be caught without this in the cupboard.

review/summary: Great for allergies
review/text: I drink this tea regularly to help with allergies.  It has been one of the few natural remedies that works really well for me.<br /><br />If you can find a single box of this to try first, I would suggest that before buying a bulk amount like this.  The taste is very herbal, and many of the ingredients have a strong flavor on their own.  In general, I am not a fan of liquorish... at all, but I really like the taste of this tea.  The other flavors balance out the liquorish root really well and it comes across as more of an anise seed flavor.<br /><br />I've also handed this tea off to family members getting over a head cold, and they have seen good results with this tea.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I agree with the other reviewers -- it's a great beverage for the kind of congestion you get with a cold, and that's why I started drinking it. But now I've gotten so addicted to it that it's the first thing I reach for when I want something hot. And it's great for those of us with acidic stomachs who are not supposed to have black tea or mint (there is a little mint in this, but only enough to give you a hint of the flavor). And the licorice is mild enough not to taste very much like licorice and just makes it sweet enough not to need sugar. Perfect in every way.

review/summary: Brilliant tea , really works to ease breathing
review/text: I love this tea because it really works, to ease lung congestion and helps lungs to feel clearer quickly and feel breathing is easier. i have a lung disease bronchiectasis, i drink this tea when my chest feels bad or when i am getting a chest infection /virus. I did not like the taste of it at first but didnt care because it helped me breath easier. but the taste has grown on me. I think its brilliant and so glad i found it as it really does help me. I buy it several boxes at a time and wouldnt be without it.

review/summary: Works Great for Asthma & Is Deliciously Sweet
review/text: I love this tea! Just as another reviewer said, Yogi Tea's Breathe Deep is phenomenally effective for asthma!<br />I recently moved into a rented house where a cat lived for 7 years; I have cat asthma, and have struggled to regain my normal breathing. I still use my Albuterol inhaler when necessary, and check in with my doctor (read: I'd still recommend traditional medicine), but nothing has worked as well as this tea! I've been drinking 3-4 cups/day, and have noticed a substantial improvement -- not just during the rest of the day, but the following days -- even when I drink only 1 cup. No one can underestimate the feeling of being able to breathe freely. This tea is a lifesaver!

review/text: I bought this (herbal) tea for relief from (a couple months of) breathing issues. Thinking that I may have asthma (I've never been diagnosed). At first it was grand, helping my cough, soothing to my throat and chest. Then surprisingly my stomach started to gurgle and I was frequenting the loo, stopped taking things were fine. Finally, last night I tried nettle (2 caps) and some ginger with honey added tea..ahh relief, sleep! Tonight I will try angelica root and see if that helps.

review/summary: YUM!!
review/text: I am addicted to this TEA!! I love Yogi Teas because of their inspiring sayings on each tea bag's tag... and this ORGANIC tea is SO delicious! It is so tasty and sweet, there is no need to add anything to it! It is perfect all by itself! I drink at least a cup or two a day of Breathe Deep. It keeps me feeling happy and breathing fabulously :)<br /><br />There is no sugar in it, but whenever I have a craving for something sweet, I just drop one of these tea bags into hot water! No calories, no added flavors or sugars, no guilt and the world is happy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea to anyone interested in finding a tasty new drink that is all natural and ORGANIC!! It seems too good to be true, but Yogi is awesome! Oh yeah, and if you have a head cold or congestion, this tea works wonders as well -- I love drinking it, even when I feel 100% healthy though!

review/text: I loved Mounds Bars as a kid decades ago.  Every few years now, I succumb to my desire for one and always am disappointed.  I suspect that the recipe has changed to lots of ingredients and preservatives  that were not used way back in my kid days.

review/text: I have purchased the Oskri dark chocolate with coconut bars and absolutely loved them! This time the dark chocolate was not available so I tried the milk chocolate. I figured they wouldn't be as good as dark chocolate since i prefer dark but thought they would still be tasty. The package I received was dented and the chocolate bars were melted. It makes it hard to open since each bar is bent and chocolate is stuck to packaging. The bars themselves taste a little stale. Needless to say this purchase was a big disappointment as I love coconut and chocolate.
