review/summary: Salty & too much sat fat
review/text: Didn't like it, BUT, if the manufacturer is listening, it could be saved.  Go with low fat/low sodium cheese, make the bar slightly bigger and you might even market it as a health food to the vegetarian market.  As is, the best use would be to dump it in a soup for taste.

review/summary: Inedible.. even Mikey didn't like them!
review/text: Before you read this, I highly recommend Just the Cheese's mini rounds in the same flavor.  I DO NOT recommend these bars.  If I could have given them zero stars, I would have.<br /><br />I thought these would be great.. I love Jalapeno, and I love cheese.. what could go wrong?  These bars could and did!  They are extremely hard to bite into.  I worried about cracking my teeth on them.  They taste like jalapeno flavored salt blocks.<br /><br />I gave them to a friend of mine who eats anything and everything (Mikey Jr!).  He didn't like these either.  He's going to try breaking them up (I assume with a hammer) and put them in his next batch of chili.  I wish him good luck. I suggested that he use them for repelling pests in his garden.<br /><br />I wrote the company, and they sent me some samples of the mini rounds.  I was skeptical, but they are GREAT!  I'll order those next time.. they are not too salty, just the right amount of crunch, and taste great.  They have 5 or 6 flavors and I like them all.

review/summary: Low carb treat
review/text: If you're low-carbing, this is a really nice little snack bar. They are very salty and won't necessarily fit everyone's taste, but I thought they were quite good. The texture is like a hard granola bar.<br /><br />Overall, I did quite well on my low carb diet and I recommend these. I gave four stars, rather than five, because of the saltiness.

review/summary: I love the company, and like the product - but a few problems
review/text: I love the Just Cheese bars. It's basically just crisped cheese, some of which have powdered flavoring mixed in. This one is white cheddar pizza flavored, which I also liked.<br /><br />You can easily make these yourself at home in just a few minutes: Put a little oil (or Pam) on aluminum foil, sprinkle on some shredded hard cheese from the bag (Parmesan is the easiest and most widely available), and bake it in an oven for 5-10 minutes until it turns golden brown. A great serving size is 20-30 half-dollar sized parmesan bites/crisps, on a normal sized baking pan. A toaster oven or convection oven is best - it makes fewer servings, but will crisp faster (3-4 minutes on 400-450). And the great thing is, if you're a low carber who misses chips & dip, your homemade cheese crisps are easily dip-able in salsa, sour cream, etc.<br /><br />If you want to replicate the "Just the Cheese" flavor, take the package of powdered cheese from a box of "white cheese" flavored mac & cheese, and sprinkle it in. Therein lies the problem for me - wayyyy too much sodium. Cheese already has a lot of sodium. But add flavoring, and it can get overwhelming fast. After just one Just the Cheese bar, I have to guzzle a glass of water.<br /><br />So I have mixed feelings - I think this product is a genius idea. A convenient, single-serving bar of crispy cheese, to throw in your bag or glove box for a low carb snack. But I grade it down for 3 reasons:<br /><br />(1) Too much sodium. However, some of the other "plain" flavors have a bit less sodium.<br /><br />(2) Taste isn't always consistent. Sometimes you get a burned piece.<br /><br />(2) The price (over $1 per bar) is really too high for 1/2 ounce of cheese.  The Atkins & South Beach bars are much cheaper - usually 2.7-3.5 ounces (nearly 5-7 times more) for about the same price. I do not think this product should cost SIX TIMES what an Atkins bar costs.<br /><br />3.5 stars for me. If the company would fix these problems, I'd give it a 5.

review/text: These are easily one of my favorite low-carb and low-calorie snacks when I'm doing the whole "no carb" deal. They are dry -- but I like them that way. They are filling and they taste good. They're not for everyone so before you buy one box of each flavor, try the bars (they're pretty dry) or the chips (less dry) and see how you like them.

review/text: These aren't your typical snack.  The target audience for these is the low-carb crowd and for us/them it feels a much needed gap in snack foods.  Yeah, they tend to be on the dry side but what do you expect?  It's dried cheese!  There aren't a whole lot of choices for crunchy snacks that are low-carb....in fact, other than Just The Cheese products your only other choice is pork rinds, and they come in only two flavors.  Just The Cheese snacks offer a broader spectrum of choice when you're counting carbs.

review/text: Gave only 4 starts because recently Amazon sent me a batch that was tough and hard to chew into. But the product itself is great if shipped fresh. The fresh ones last for a couple of months.  But if you get a hard batch, recommend getting replacements because they are really hard to bite into and sometimes I feel like my teeth may fall out trying to rip into the hard pieces.

review/text: I've been a Fruit Leather fan for a long time and it really pays to buy in bulk. When these are on sale at our local grocery stores they're 50 cents each. What a deal on Amazon with the current promo code! I ordered 1 box of mango and 1 box of raspberry, and both were fresh (not old/hard/stale as some Amazon groceries can be).  We don't eat much refined sugar in our home, so these are a convenient naturally sweet snack to eat anywhere/anytime.  I always keep a few in my purse for our kids.  Yum! Hopefully I can make these last longer than a week in our household!

No added sugars or any junk and 1/2 serving of fruit.  The hands-down CHEAPEST place to buy these is Costco or Sam's Club, but if you don't have one of those than Amazon is the place to go.  A good deal on these is $0.40 or less per one.  Amazon is close to that.

Finally thought to look on Amazon, and not only are they just like I remembered, they're WAY cheaper buying in bulk!<br /><br />Actually, not just like I remembered - these are way more moist and tasty than when I used to buy them.  I assume the ones in the store were probably old and stale which is why they were more like leather in their consistency, while these are like thick fruit rollups.<br /><br />Will definitely be buying these again!

review/text: These raspberry flavored bars aren't particularly great to me.  I was never sure if they were made by the same company responsible for fruit roll ups or just a knock off but either way, the taste is really similar.  Perhaps the only difference is that these bars have a stronger raspberry taste.  I don't really like the taste that much however.  I'd rather eat raspberries straight off the vine.  However my family likes them so I will give these raspberry-flavored bars a fair review and a purchasing recommendation based on their tastes.

review/summary: Healthy snack for adults!
review/text: As a child who grew up on fruit rollups, I crave gummy sweets.  As an adult now aware of what the ingredients were in products like that, this is the BEST alternative I have found! Yes - this consistency is not like a fruit rollup, it is a little grainy and tougher but that's why it's called a leather, not a rollup.  I like all of the flavors they have available but raspberry is definitely one of my favorites. I enjoy the slight tart it offers. All in all I'd say give it a try, you can't go wrong with this great price!

I say reduce because even decaf has some degree of caffeine in it. Another great thing about this is it lets you enjoy a cup of coffee later in the day without keeping you from being able to fall asleep.<br /><br /> *warning if you are like me and you are well caffeinated throughout the day, bring aspirin, or some sort of pain reliever, you will have withdrawal headaches.

review/text: I had been using happy belly baby cereal since Gavin was 4 months old, but decided to switch it up and offer him some new grains. I chose this cereal because it includes barley in the mix, which I like alot. Gavin really likes the taste, eats it up just fine. It is a finer cereal than happy belly, and can get a little gelatinous, but Gavin doesn't seem to mind (he hates Gerber baby cereals, however). I like to add mashed fruit, canned pumpkin  or spices (especially cinnamon and ginger) to the cereal to keep it interesting.

review/text: I really don't have any complaints besides that it's more flaky than Earth's best. I like the consistency of EB better, but this is cheaper and I can't find EB in any grocery stores in my area. Maybe at a Whole Foods (which isn't in the area).<br /><br />With almond milk it tends to be more goopy. With rice milk and water it mixes a little better. I tasted some and it tastes very much like rice so I am thinking that the rice is for filler and there is less ratio of barley and oat.<br /><br />My 8 mo son eats it great tho, never a problem.

review/text: If you can remember what Special K tasted like before wheat became a four-letter word, and you loved it, then this is for you. I'm in no position to do a side-by-side comparison, but it matches my memory, and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The only surprise I found in the ingredient list was soy, and there were no crap filler starches like potato. That said, it's your typical, almost mainstream cereal with sugar, added vitamins, corn, rice, and small 120 calorie serving sizes that no one actually serves. This isn't a crime, but neither is it a health food.<br /><br />I was delighted to find this on clearance locally, but at full price it'll join many of Glutino's other products on the rare "special treats and cravings" portion of my shopping list. I'm glad it exists, but it shouldn't cost as much as it does.

review/summary: be aware: they downgraded when they changed packaging :(
review/text: Sadly, this is no longer the super-premium jerky that it used to be. Granted, if you're used to grocery-store jerky, then this is still a much better product. But if you've acclimated to chemical-free jerky, then the "smoke flavoring" that they've recently started adding tastes like, well, smoke flavoring, and not the real thing.<br /><br />You may not notice a difference. Apparently jerky is one of those things where you notice a down-shift in flavor, even when you wouldn't notice an up-shift in flavor. (Like margarine eaters think butter tastes fine, and powdered milk drinkers think cartoned milk tastes fine, but when people do the opposite, they find the tastes terrible. Jerky is the same--if you upgrade from convenience store jerky to premium you might not notice it, but when you downgrade from "the real thing" to anything else, it tastes distinctly artificial.)<br /><br />I used to buy this in bulk every few months (with a discount per Amazon Subscribe & Save), but the change in flavor made me double-check the ingredients list, and I found that the new "smoke flavoring" was added when they changed packaging. So this jerky is good, but not worth the premium any more. If anyone has a suggestion for an all-natural replacement without ingredients like "smoke flavoring" I'd appreciate it, since I'm now searching for something new.

review/text: old version of this product with the packaging shown in the picture was good. the new brown crosshatch pattern package (3 oz bags) version is no good. seems they sold out and went for cheaper beef and/or processing. really bummed out.

review/summary: Awesome Organic MSG and Gluten free!! Reasonable price!!
review/text: I have bought this product several times now. It's a great healthy snack for my kids, one of whom does not tolerate gluten. I could not find a single super-market brand that was free of both gluten and MSG. These bags are 3oz and most of the "regular" jerkey bags in the stores are around 3.75 oz. In my stores, the bags are usually around $5, maybe $4 if you're lucky, and with Amazon's average pricing on this it comes out to be about $5.50 a bag. So a little bit smaller and a little bit more pricey but I think it's WELL worth it for organic beef with no MSG, not to mention the perk of no gluten that is necesary for so many these days. Next time I'm going to try the BBQ flavor. The Teriyaki is great for us but very mild, so depending on what you are looking for if you want a big flavor punch you may want to try a different flavor.

review/text: I have been receiving this jerky via subscribe and save for a long time now.  I just opened the second pouch out of my last order and there is mold on the jerky!  The sell by date is 8/28/13.  The first pouch I opened out of this case was fine.  I went to return it, but it is not eligible for return!  Needless to say, I will be canceling my subscription to this product and looking for another.  This is too expensive to risk waste because of mold.

review/text: This jerky may contain MSG.  .  The ketchup they use has "spices" and "natural flavoring" in it which<br />is code for MSG.  Check out Dr. Russell Blaylock's vidoes on youtube re: the DANGER of MSG.  And the over 30 names used in food products to hide the fact that there is MSG<br />in it.  It says "no ADDED MSG" which just means they didn't add any themselves, but it in no way means they don't use ingredients which already have MSG in them.

review/summary: Great snack for growing kids!
review/text: I have started keeping this on hand for a "grab & go" snack that is also healthy for growing kids.  We take a couple bags to the park along with some apples and coconut flakes to refuel after an afternoon of play.  I also send a bag with my teens when they go on a sleepover or trip. Having some non-refrigerated protein available seems to help them keep up their energy better than the greasy, salty or sugary snacks that are usually available.  It is a pricey snack compared to the typical processed options, however, it is also real food and I'd much rather skimp on the chips and soda and spend our money on solid snacks that benefit growing bodies!

review/summary: Beats all other jerky except homemade
review/text: This is by far the best jerky I have had.  I ordered the black pepper and it isn't that hot at all.  The best thing is the low sodium, you barely taste any salt.  And it is low carb, 5g, which comes from sugar, but it does not taste sweet.  It is a soft jerky compared to those brittle brands and chews nicely.  Wow, I've got to put another piece in my mouth.<br /><br />UPDATE:  About a week ago I opened a pouch and only ate a piece or two.  Today, while sitting in my semi-dark office, I opened the pouch and ate a piece.  Before my next piece I looked inside the bag and all I saw was white....all covered in mold.  Thankfully I only ate one piece....so far so good.<br /><br />I guess the rule is that once you open a pouch, eat it right away.

review/summary: Way too sweet and reconstituted texture
review/text: I would give this really a 1.5 star, but I was generous. It is way too sweet. Others have said the same in their reviews, but I ignored them to my chagrin. It is very very thin and has a texture and appearance like it has been reconstituted and highly processed. Because it is so thin, there are never any big lumps of gristle, but sometimes you can tell the meat quality as a bit off in some pieces. The worst problem is the overly sweet flavor, the second problem is the texture and meat quality. This is not a very good jerky. Their Buffalo, while also too sweet, is much better as is their Turkey. They are much much less expensive than a really premium jerky like those from Mountain America, so it is a toss up. For the price, I may re-order the Turkey and perhaps Buffalo, but I will never order this Beef again.

review/text: Jerky is expensive, but it's a great snack.  My wife and I are striving to eat grass-fed, natural beef, and this is the best option we have found to have a handy snack nearby.  The jerky is very good, but not great.  It's better than Jack's Links or Oberto, but this pales in comparison to the jerky you can get at most meat markets.  This is probably the best option unless you can make the jerky yourself.
