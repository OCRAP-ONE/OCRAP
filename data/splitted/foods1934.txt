review/text: I received the variety pack as a gift, but I don't have a single cup machine. Since "grocery" items are not returnable, I tried mixing it with the regular coffee in the filter for a different taste. Unfortunately, the packet clogged the filter and it overran onto the counter. Now, I have a mess to clean. Gracious gift givers, please check what you recipient has before sending.

review/summary: Not as advertised! Extremely Disappointed!
review/text: I ordered this sampler because it is titled Flavored K-Cup Sampler. I ended up with only 6 out of the 24 are "flavored". The rest are a limited variety of brews and roasts. To be exact, I got 3 gm pumpkin spice, 2 gm spicy eggnog, 1 van houtte french vanilla, 3 caribou blend, 3 gm columbian fair trade select, 3 gm nantucket blend, 3 newman's own special blend, 3 folgers lively columbian, and 3 gm decaf breakfast blend.  Not what I was expecting at all. I should have listened to the other negative reviews and not bought from this seller even after reading the seller's response to some of the negative feedback with promises to revise the way they fill orders. And if you are looking to give this as a gift, the cups come in a zip-loc bag, not that it mattered to me because I am using them in a gift basket. The only positive was the prompt shipping, I expected it tomorrow and it showed up a day early.

review/text: I believe that most reviewers usually balance out a product, with the naysayers usually spouting out more negative things that those happy campers.  I was a happy camper with this bag of coffee cups.  All in perfect condition.  Nice selection, some of which I never would have bought (like the Green Mountain wild blueberry, which turned out to be delightfully refreshing cup of coffee).  A lot of Green Mountain, and for me, I really like GM, so that was good.  Only positive constructive criticism, is less hazelnut (although I like it, there was an unproportional lot of them) and more of the oddball flavors, as in not just one of them, make it two or three.

review/text: I didn't notice how widely distributed the reviews for this were until I received my box. I had several varieties and flavors of coffee so judging from the most negative reviews, the seller either changed their sorting methods or I got lucky. Since this is a random assortment, you should probably expect some differences.<br /><br />If you're particular about your coffee flavors, this may not be the best option. However, if you're looking to try several brands/flavors/styles of coffee, this is a great way to do it without buying 100s of K-cups at the same time! I enjoy waking up to a different flavor of coffee every morning, so this is perfect for me and I'll continue to buy from this seller.

review/text: I was excited to try a variety of new flavors before committing to an entire box of flavored K-cups I might not like. Needless to say I'm disappointed. I should have read the reviews but neglected to do so. When they arrived, The K-Cups were in a beat-up Ziplock bag. I got two flavored coffees - one Golden French Toast, one Pumpkin spice. The rest were Columbian blends or Caribou coffee, and half of what was there was decaf. Nowhere on the description does it mention normal blends or decaf coffee. Several of the K-cups seals had been broken, so more than likely the coffee would be stale. Returning this for a refund.

I got them and they don't expire for 6-7 months! That's plenty of time to drink all of that coffee.<br />Also the packaging that is came in was good, no damaged cups.<br /><br />This package may be a little expensive, but the person who is putting all of this together needs to earn a little money for their trouble! Also, what if you spent $14-$15 on a pack of 24 of some flavor you didn't like? This sampler allows you to try ones so that the other 23 don't go to waste.<br /><br />I love this so much, I am probably going to have to order another one!

review/text: How does a multimillion dollar company ship a product to it's customers in a paper bag? Yes, it came in a shipping box...but the product itself (24 flavored K-Cups) were all thrown inside an unmarked brown bag and stapled. Leads one to believe that they're cashing in on unsellable broken boxes of K-Cups, sad part is that they're still getting PRIME FULL PRICE!!! Well, a lesson has been learned and I will not purchase this "item" again...Thanks Amazon! And by the way, almost a third of the contents were that disgusting GROVE SQUARE brand and various decaf (of which we don't drink!) Such a convenient way to dump your stock of the brands & brews that don't move! Shopping via the internet is okay most times but it can damn sure bite you in the ass as well. The only reason they got ONE STAR is because of the Kahlua Blend, which was very good.

review/text: EXTREMELY disappointed!  I received 15 decaf coffees!  9 were Hazelnut decaf and 6 were French vanilla decaf.  I didn't order a decaf selection.  The selection is horrible.  I will never order this again.

review/summary: Don't understand the negatives....:-(
review/text: I was really wary about ordering this item because of the mixed and substantially negative reviews.  I ordered anyway because it was a great price and thought I would take my chances.  What a wonderful surprise!!!  There were negative reviews concerning the packaging.  The item comes loose in a brown paper bag that has been properly packaged and boxed.  I don't see the problem.  Others posted that the selection was minimal.  That may have been their experience, but not mine.  I ordered 2 of this item (48 K-cups total) and had 21 different flavors, all name brands.  Can't imagine it getting better!!!!  I will say that what induced me to take a chance on the product was the price.  It was substantially lower than the competition.  When I received my shipment, I went back to Amazon to order 4 more and the price has more than tripled!  It is still competitive, but the urgency was eliminated with the price increase.

review/text: I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this purchase.  The product description indicates a variety of caffeinated coffees and five (5) of the 24 k-cups in each of the two (2)  were for cider drinks, iced coffee and DEcaffeinated coffee.  I feel like I have been ripped off.  Twenty percent (20%) of the coffee I received is not what was described and not what I wanted.  I won't buy from this seller again.

review/summary: 21 of 34 from this "Sampler Pack" were 3 Fall and Christmas flavors..Hey its June!
review/text: I've never been more dissapointed in an assortment then the package I received today.  Of 34 k-cups, 21 were last years Holiday flavors from Green Mountain.  11 were Gingerbread, 8 Pumpkin Spice and 2 Spicy Eggnog.. Tried these flavors before and HATE all of them.  Seriously... 11 Gingerbread?? This is June...  Plus this is not a "sample" of Gingerbread... that's a box of it.  Coffee was only from Gloria Jean and Green Mountain, when I was supposed to get a "sampler pack"?  Of 34 k-cups only 13 are what I call a variety (6 different flavors) so the rest is money down the drain.  Nothing like trying to pawn off last years bad flavors...

review/summary: Most weren't flavored
review/text: I didn't expect to receive the exact mix that is pictured, but I assumed that it would be representative of what we'd received. We received 4 flavored coffees (2 each of Golden French Toast and Pumpkin Spice). The other 20 coffees were a variety of blends, but not what I consider "flavored" coffees (Columbian, Nantucket Blend, Caribou Blend, Folgers Lively Columbian).<br /><br />So if you are looking for flavored coffees, I don't suggest this item!<br /><br />After re-reading the product description that says "This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee.", I got even more annoyed. My package included only 4 flavored coffees and it also included decaf! So I decided to return the item - then learned that it was non-returnable. I followed the links to correspond with customer service, and after a few minutes of chatting with someone, they said that they'd refund my money. Doesn't sound like a standard policy - but I'm glad that amazon.com stands behind their website.<br /><br />JoAn

review/text: I was disappointed with the selection here - "24 count" sampler made me think I'd be getting 24 flavors to try.  Instead it was only around 9 or 10, with a few of each.  Seemed like someone just dumped them randomly in a box.  I didn't like most of these, and the donut house coffees of "chocolate glazed donut" and "cinnamon roll" didn't taste like they were named.  If you want to try out a bunch of different coffees, I wouldn't recommend this selection.

review/summary: Tempting treasures for coffee lovers!
review/text: I bought a Cuisinart K-cup brewer for my husband to save for his Christmas present. Unfortunately it came very quickly and the box was undisguised, arriving on one of the rare occasions when he was home and I was out! So we opened it very early and have been enjoying it for a couple of weeks. I also bought both Solofil and Ekobrew refillable cups, because  standard K-cups are both expensive and non-earth friendly. I still wanted to keep a few K-cups for emergencies and company, and was very saddened to find no real variety packs in the store. One of the Keurig "variety" packs has 4 blends inside, but they are all plain coffee, e.g. "Sumatra", "Arabica", etc, etc.<br /><br />My husband really hates flavored coffee, and I really love it, so this package was a godsend. Neither of us sweetens our coffee, so sticky-sweet creams are no good to us. Our order came in no time (sole complaint, the box was HUGE, the actual coffee package is about the size of the lunch bag)and the assortment is wonderful. I intended to save it for those special occasions or guests, but I don't think I have the willpower.<br /><br />One of the flavors was blueberry. I never would have been even tempted to purchase a blueberry-flavored coffee, but it was wonderful! I still have yet to try all the standard cinnamon, hazelnut and chocolate varieties I have, and I can only hope against hope that there is any left when-or-if company arrives!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TSHIOA">Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig Brewers ,Two Pack</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW">ekobrew Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a>

I really love the fact that you get different brands of k-cups and there was only 2 of each flavor, so I truly got an assortment rather than some of the other samplers out there that give you 4 or 8 or the same flavor.

Nearly half of my 34-count sampler consisted of 2 flavors - spiced egg nog, and pumpkin spice. To make matters worse, both taste very similar. Not exactly the flavors you are looking for in June, either.<br /><br />The only good thing to come out of this mess is that it introduced me to a single cup of wild blueberry which was delicious. I'll be sure to order a carton of just that in the future and stay away from the so-called "sampler" packs on amazon, which are obviously just a method for sellers to offload unpopular or outdated flavors.

Only got maybe 2-3 unique flavors in the entire box. Otherwise, it was all repeats. The posting is totally misleading, so don't order from them if you actually think you're going to get a lot of different flavors and roasts to try. If this company were above-board, they'd fix this for their dissatisfied customers and do better in the future than just raiding and repackaging Costco boxes.

review/text: In a nutshell- save yourself the upset and buy your K-cup samplers from someone else. I read reviews before ordering so I expected to get a few duplicates, but WOW. Out of all the reviews I've read I think I've gotten the shortest stick so far. ALL of the coffees in the brown paper bag were from Green Mountain, ALL of them, and of those more than half were from the Christmas and Fall 2011 samplers. It's mid May 2012 and I just got sent an order filled with multiple pumpkin spice, spicy eggnog, gingerbread coffees, Really. They also all expire in the next 30 - 60 days, and even though I buy these for my office its a hard sell that any of these guys are going to want to drink "spicy eggnog" in June in Florida- so with that said more than half of these are going to wind up in the trash. Huge let down. Luckily there are other k-cup sellers I've bought from in the past that I have been satisfied with.

review/summary: A Very "Vanilla" Sampler Pack
review/text: The selection of K-Cups was not as pictured.  Out of 34 cups, I received 13 vanilla and 6 hazelnut.  Only 4 cups were not a Green Mountain Coffee product.  I ordered the sampler pack specifically so that I could try different flavors from a variety of producers.  To say that I was dissapointed is an understatement.  Clearly this product was a collection of "leftovers." It come packaged in a stapled brown paper bag. Don't waste your time or money.

review/summary: Pathetic Sampler Pack
review/text: The photo shows only about 15 Green Mountain K-cups, so I was disappointed to see my package arrive with 29 Green Mountain coffees and only 5 from other companies.  Green Mountain makes an excellent product but this is far from a sampler pack as there are several repeats.  Last time purchasing from "Deals on Call".

review/summary: Not really an assortment
review/text: I was really looking forward to trying different brands and flavors of coffee but this assortment was 90% Green Mountain and 75% some type of vanilla.  It included 4 Blueberry (haven't tried that yet but not really happy about it).  I get the impression that you get about 4 or 5 of a good variety and then a handful each of whatever flavors don't sell very well.  Luckily I'm okay with all the vanilla but this definitely was not a "variety" pack.

review/summary: Not all caffeinated, and no where does it say you will receive decaf products
review/text: It is very disappointing for a caffeinated coffee drinker to receive decaf coffee when the website states that you will, in fact, receive CAFFEINATED varieties only.  I also received iced coffee (which was also not stated).  Your website needs to address this concern or you need to adjust your assortment to reflect this.  Other companies who mix K Cup assortments will do a caffeinated and decaf option, you should consider this and assure your customers are receiving what you are trying to sell.<br /><br />I did, although, receive only 1 of each flavor (which was very good in terms of variety).<br /><br />***UPDATE- I e-mailed Amazon customer service to let them know of the decaf issue and they were very quick to addressing my concerns.  Please post back if you receive decaf, as this was a very nice assortment otherwise and I would be interested in purchasing if they can address this problem***

review/text: I wish I would have read more of the reviews before I  ordered this "sampler".  I have had the same issue as many others: 1/4 of mine were all the same flavor, and two flavors weren't even on the list of POSSIBLES.  They were Eggnog and Gingerbread, CLEARLY leftover from the holiday season and who knows how old.  Like many others, I understand that you can't get one of everything...or could you????? Wouldn't it be wonderful if these were pre-packaged with DIFFERENT ones from the selections listed?

review/summary: I hate to say "Me, too", but...
review/text: I recently purchased my first Keurig machine, the B60 model (which is wonderful, by the way), and my machine was one of those "bonus packages" that came with a small variety sampler pack (12 k-cups). Having gone through most of this fantastic assortment already, I decided to order a variety assortment from Amazon. I read all the reviews -- positive and negative -- and decided to take a chance on this one. It arrived today, and although there are some neat flavors that I am anxious to try, there is VERY LITTLE variety. I ordered the 24-count sampler. Out of these, 4 k-cups are truly unique/limited edition flavors that are not Green Mountain. That leaves 20 k-cups of Green Mountain that either French Vanilla (the majority), Caramel Vanilla Cream, Blueberry or Hazelnut. Luckily, these are at least flavors I like, they are just not all that unique. Probably won't order from these folks again, due to the lack of variety. I was really hoping for more choices, like the one that came with my Keurig (the sampler pack had 12 different coffees from all different coffee companies, some I hadn't heard of and were quite good). I hate to whine, but my morning cup is a very important part of my day! Too bad... if you like French Vanilla with a few surprises thrown in, then this assortment is for you, but not if you are looking for a true variety.

review/text: Ordered the 34 count and it was Extremely disappointing.  I expected to get at least one-two of every flavor shown on the 34 count sampler.  I would say about 24 are either Hazelnut or Vanilla.  Which are last I need since I buy Hazelnut by the 80 pack carton at BJs.  No Mudslide, no Butter Toffee, No Donut House Cinnamon Roll, No Hawaiian, No Limited Edition. No Khalua, No Cappucino, No Timothy's coffee.  This is a farce and I am so disappointed in Amazon.  I have never had a problem before but this was really a "bait and switch" as far as I am concerned.

review/text: I recently bought a Keurig coffee maker. When I came across the "flavored Coffee Sampler" on the Amazon site, I thought it was a great way to try different brands/flavors without having to by a whole box. This was through "Deals On Call LLC. I just received the "Sampler." I am very disappointed. Don't waste your money. I got multiples of the same brand/flavor.<br />It seems like they are just getting rid of the products that don't sell. I received 2 Spicy Eggnog - in February.<br />The  K-cups I received:<br />8 Donut House (5 Chocolate Glazed Donut, 3 Cinnamon Roll)<br />9 Gloria Jeans (3 flavors)<br />6 Green Mountain and 1 Timothy's<br />I did not receive ANY Van Houtte or Wolfgang Puck<br />If I wanted mostly Vanilla, I would have ordered it. I will not be using this site again.

Unless I just LOVE Green Mountain coffee then this plan didn't quite work out. See my photo above for the actual 24 k-cups that I received. They were tossed into a brown paper bag and sealed with a sticker. They were placed into a cardboard box. None were damaged and it got here quickly.

review/summary: Ordered 24, received 23
review/text: Orders have always arrived on time. I've ordered the 24-count "variety pack" a few times now. I was a bit suspect the first time when they arrived in a brown paper bag, stapled at the top, with a printed bar code on it. I don't know why, but that was more acceptable to me than the 1-gallon ziplock bag of K-cups I received this time - this time with only 23 K-cups in it, not the 24 I paid for. I suppose you could say that the ziplock will keep the coffee "fresher", but even the manufacturers ship K-cups in cardboard boxes since cups are already sealed. I realize this company/person probably purchased many individual flavors of coffee and is creating a hand-made mix of all of them to create the variety pack that doesn't really exist. But after this last purchase I think I'm done. I actually care less about receiving 23 instead of 24 cups, although nobody likes to get less than they paid for. It's the minimalist packaging and "made in my basement" look of the packaging that has done it for me.

I hope the company adds more variety without using sampler mixes.

review/summary: Crunchy Corn Flakes
review/text: I am not a sugary foods eater anymore and I read some reviews where the reviewer said this product was taste-less.<br />And I sure it was to them so not to belittle that experience ... but for me this product has great taste and crunch.<br /><br />Texture and taste are important and this cereal had both.  This cereal is Organic, Gluten Free and Unsweetened.<br />Therefore, I bought this product.  So many gluten free cereals are sweetened and I don't want that, esp. in the morning.<br /><br />This cereal is simple but the cereal holds up well to the unsweetned almond milk, meaning it doesn't get "soggy" too quickly either.<br /><br />To me, these flakes taste "toasty", as in toasted corn and that is where the flavor comes from.<br />I add liquid Stevia (all natural chemical free sweetner) directly to my Almond Milk. This is where I get my desired added flavor<br />and sweetness.<br /><br />Good to use for recipes calling for Corn Flakes too. Chances are your recipe has all the sugar and flavor you want already so why add more sugar via corn flakes if you don't have too.<br /><br />Most people taste buds are conditioned by our American processed foods to taste, register and like sugary and salty only.<br /><br />This cereal allows you to determine if you want sugar in that breakfast bowl or not. Not alot of cereals give you that option.<br />Esp. those that are organic and gluten free as well.

review/summary: Light, Crunchy and Delicious!  TRY THE NEW VERSION - The reviews are on their OLD RECIPE
review/text: I love these cornflakes.  I can't believe anyone would say they taste like cardboard??  I think they ate the Nature's Path version instead which are thick and icky.  These are light and delicious with a real corn taste.  I eat them with soymilk or in my yogurt.  They really are good and look just like the cover of the box.  They are the best cornflakes out there.  If you are looking for a more natural version of Kellog's cornflakes - this is the brand to buy.  The other brands taste awful and I have tried them all!<br />Addendum: I realized that the BAD reviews are from their OLD Version of the corn flakes. You have to try their NEW version which says "NEW" right on the box. If it doesn't say NEW - you are eating the old version and the old version does taste like cardboard. I realized this after I wrote my review and opened a box of the old recipe (the store I bought mine at must have had some old versions left) and they are awful.  I recommend trying them again if you didn't like them before - they really are delicious and light - not like they used to be. I'm bringing this box back to get the new version.

review/summary: Really nice, non-gmo Corn Flakes !
review/text: After avoiding cereals for almost two years, I just had a hankering, so I got two of the Erewhon organic cereals at Whole Foods. This one and the crispy rice one, both gluten free.<br /><br />This was nice. I liked the crunch and simplicity. I love that it's organic/non-gmo. GMO-corn is seriously scary stuff (have you read the articles on it?). So, while i do better with lower-moderate carb way of eating, when I get in my "I want crunch cereal" phase, I will hit this or the crispy brown rice gluten free one from Erewhon. I trust the ingredients and the flavor and crunch is very satisfying.<br /><br />I tend to shop a lot on Amazon, but this 6-pack is just too much for my tiny apartment pantry space. I do recommend this for folks who like corn flakes/gluten-free cereals, but don't want the crap stuff.

review/text: This is the only cereal my 3 year old son can have who has several food intolerances. It is impossible to find a cereal that is gluten free and SUGAR FREE! There is many choices with one or the other, but we need both. I have looked and looked everywhere, and this is the ONLY option that he can have. The great thing is that he loves it! He is 3 years old, and he begs for cereal and milk (rice milk). I add a little bit of honey to it to sweeten it up a little for him. I love that I know exactly what he is getting with this cereal. With only two ingredients, it isn't hard to know what's in it! I am wondering if maybe the people who don't like the taste are used to the junk food cereal that we see in the cereal aisle at the grocery store. Have you ever read what is in a box of cornflakes from the cereal aisle? This cereal is perfect for anyone who is getting back to basics, or trying to watch what their kids are eating. I wish a lot of other companies would take a cue from Erewhon and give us some cereal that is pure without a lot of unnecessary garbage in it! The best part is he loves this cereal, and Amazon runs out of it so often I have a hard time keeping it in the house! Great cereal to try if you are tired of filling your body with garbage, or have special dietary needs. But be aware that when you are going to organic and gluten free, it may take a little while for your tastebuds to adjust to eating real food again. Give it a fair chance before you give up on it if you care about what you eat!

review/summary: Very good!!!!
review/text: The Erewhon corn flakes is very good, light and organic...very expensive compare to other brands but it is one of those cereals that you can add fruits or other toppings to have your own taste. Buy a single box at a supermarket first before buying the 6 boxes since some people don't like it after buying it and are stuck with the extra cereal boxes.

review/text: I have been eating these cornflakes for years.  I find the taste just right - light but clearly corn.  I eat them with fruit, or fruit juice judiciously poured.  The flakes will get soggy in too much moisture, but I find the taste and lack of additives well worth it if I misjudge the amount of juice.  Any juicy fruit is perfect, or one could just eat these flakes by the handful!  Frankly, I won't eat any other cereal.
