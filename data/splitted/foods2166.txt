review/text: I love some of their other teas, I'm a chocoholic, and I love hazelnut coffee.  But I HATED this flavor.  It reminds me of the pharmacy's first attempts years ago to flavor medicine--has a wonderful smell but a weird, almost disgusting aftertaste.  It actually made me a bit sick to my stomach!  I'll stick with the Vanilla Chai--very tasty.

review/summary: Perfect Dessert Tea - Baby Bear
review/text: I'm not a coffee drinker and got tired of not having something to drink with a dessert. This tea is perfect with milk and sugar! I feel like a grown up when I drink it. Don't get me wrong I know I could just drink hot chocolate and I do but sometimes depending on what I have it with or when, hot chocolate is too sweet. Which feels hypocritical for me to say because that's how I like it, but only when it is the dessert. So this is my perfect medium. It's like a term I like to use, it's baby bear! We all know the story of Goldie Locks and the three bears. Well coffee is pappa bear's bed, too hard to get over the bitterness. Hot chocolate is mamma bear's bed, too soft or sweet for everyday. This tea is baby bear's bed, just right. Now I'm no Goldie Locks but I'd like to think of myself as that content when I drink this tea. Love it!

review/text: From reading other reviews, it seems people either hate or love this tea with no in-between.  I happen to love it...am here to re-order.<br /><br />Last year this product disappeared from local stores so I reluctantly ordered this box of 6 ... good grief-so many! Surprisingly, barely a year has passed and I'm out (in spite of having an average of 4-6 other favorite boxes of tea open at any one time).<br /><br />As with most teas, the flavor definitely improves with a bit of milk or cream (my favorite) or honey (with the milk or instead of ...). Sometimes I brew two bags at once...my favorite: this vanilla nut with Trader Joe's Organic Mint Melange.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Smooth and delicious
review/text: I've been drinking Stash teas for some time now but usually stuck to their caffeinated versions.  Once I found out I was pregnant, I made the switch to decaf and was happy to find that Stash has a nice selection of flavored decaf black teas.  However, this tea in particular is a favorite.<br /><br />In order to really bring out the flavors, I would suggest adding some milk and a sweetener (I usually use honey and if I do use sugar, I use turbinado sugar).  This makes the tea very smooth and creamy, something close to a tea latte.  The flavor is nicely chocolaty with just the right touch of hazelnut, which I find to be overpowering in large quantities.  I often drink this tea as a dessert-like indulgence but it would also be good in the morning in place of a flavored coffee.

review/summary: Good, mild green
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker and so I was at a bit of a loss when I became pregnant.  I wanted to cut caffeinated tea out of my diet during the pregnancy but soon found that meant my choices were limited to herbals and a small handful of decaf black teas, which were mostly flavored.  One day I came across this one at the grocery store and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I've long enjoyed Stash teas for their quality, which is pretty incomparable.  I generally prefer loose teas to bagged but Stash is one of those rare teas whose flavor isn't compromised by the bag.  I found this to be the case with this particular tea.  It's not a very complex flavor, which is why I wouldn't give it a full five stars.  However, it is very mild and has a nice, subtle nutty flavor.  It's definitely a good tea for those who are new to greens as when it's brewed appropriately it has none of the bitterness or strong grassy flavor that can sometimes come through in greens.  It's an easy drinking tea and I sip it throughout the day, to the point where I drink around three oversized mugs of it a day.  In light of this, I now order it by the 6-pack from Amazon in order to have a continuous supply.

review/summary: Great tasting Tea
review/text: This is a great tasting Tea that is unfortunately no longer on the store shelves in my area.<br /><br />It tastes sort of like a creamy hot cocoa. So it's a great replacement if, like me you're lactose intolerant. It also comes in regular I believe for those who need their caffeine fix :)<br /><br />Also of note is that each tea bag is individually sealed in a foil package so the last bag is as fresh as the first. I've seen a lot of tea companies switch to loose bags and they get old quickly after you open the box. These are always fresh.

review/summary: chocolate hazelnut tea
review/text: The first time I tried it I was kind of dissapointed. It just tasted like chocolate flavored water. I brewed it a second time and got better results. You have to steep it till you get it kind of strong, add quite a bit of sugar and milk, and it is quite good, for a tea. I think that was the problem, I expected hot chocolate - you can't get hot chocolate from a tea. I would rather drink ovaltine, if I want something that tastes chocolatey. It does smell wonderful. I gave it four stars as a tea, and not especially as a hot chocolate drink.

review/summary: Not bad for a decaf green
review/text: As someone who loves Japanese-style green tea, I highly recommend Stash's regular green tea. That's why I ordered their green decaf. However, this decaf does not have the same qualities as their regular green tea. The tea is not green in color -- it is more of a brownish color -- and it doesn't have that fresh "green" taste I enjoy with their caffeinated version.  Maybe green tea just doesn't keep its color or flavor when it is decaffeinated.  It's not too bad though, and I'll have to keep trying it to see if it grows on me.  I actually have not found the perfect green decaf yet.<br /><br />PS: After a long period of thinking I didn't like it, then going back to try it again, it may not be as bad as I first thought.  Most green decafs disappoint, so don't consider any green decafs as having true green tea flavor.  Stash's isn't objectionable like some, it's just bland.  It's a bit better than most green decafs, but not nearly as good as good Japanese caffeinated green tea.  For true green tea taste, try a Japanese Sencha or Macha caffeinated tea, like Kirkland's Signature Macha or Yamamotoyama teas.  I very much DISlike the Stash Organic Premium Decaf Green however, and urge you not to buy it. I have a concern about the levels of fluoride in green teas (especially Chinese teas, so I've read), but I suppose if consumed in moderation, like everything else, the risks shouldn't be of great concern, and the benefits probably outweigh them.

review/summary: My cure for morning coffee
review/text: My doctor recently suggested (strongly) that I cut out my 3+ cups of coffee per day. Now mind you, I am a Starbucks drinker. I LOVE my coffee and I have for years. I told my doctor and myself that this was not possible. However, I re-thought and considering my health issues, I decided to take the plunge, so to speak. . . into the No-coffee, no caffeine pool. But what to substitute on those cold mornings??? I have enjoyed Stash Chai tea for a few years but it was always a treat for winter days when I was already over-coffeed. I tried many teas to see if anything satisfied to replace for my morning joe. Nothing, truly, Nothing satisfied my taste buds, my comfort buttons...my need for a stimulating aroma. Until. . . I went back to my STASH Chai. Decaf as it is, it satisfies all my taste and aroma needs and we are now 7 months out and I declare myself fully De-coffee'd. I no longer need that cup of jolt any longer and I am fully satisfied by my STASH decaf chai. I am amazed and delighted! I want to stock up on my tea, lest they stop making it! Heaven forbid! I get my STASH with the regular subscription monthly. Can't be without my STASH Decaf Chai!

review/text: All the ladies at my office LOVE this tea. I introduced a coworker to it and she convinced me to buy several boxes for the office. I just bought a box last Friday and today (Monday) it is half gone! The flavor is not super chocolatey, but has a delicate chocolate taste to it with creamy hazelnut notes. It's great with a splash of almond milk and a tiny bit of sugar. This and Mighty Leaf's chocolate mint truffle tea are my two favorite afternoon teas. When I'm craving something sweet, I just have a cup of this tea and it satisfies my sweet tooth and my chocolate cravings all at once. Again, if you're looking for a really chocolatey drink, this tea isn't anything like, for example, hot chocolate. It's just a hint of chocolatey and nutty flavor.

review/text: STASH PREMIUM TEA has little to no taste, depending on the flavor used.  The Decaf Chocolate Hazelnut Tea has absolutely NO flavor even when I try 3 tea bags to a cup of boiling water. I purchased 6 - 18 count boxes.  I had tried a hot chocolate tea in one of our little delis and it was wonderful.  I don't remember the name of the tea.  I don't know if this is common for STASH tea or if I received an old batch.  I'm sitting here with over 100 tea bags with absolutely no flavor.<br /><br />If you're looking for a tea with flavor, I would discourage your using this tea.

review/summary: Love the bergamot flavor!
review/text: One thing I like about Stash teas is the packaging. Each bag is sealed in a foil pouch which retains the tea's flavor. I also like the box because once I take the plastic wrapper off, it becomes a dispenser that I keep on my counter. I love the fragrance and taste of bergamot which is added to quality decaf tea to make Stash Premium Decaf Earl Grey Tea. I often breathe in the scent of the tea while waiting for it to cool. Heavenly!

review/summary: Great for iced tea!
review/text: I make Stash Premium Decaf Raspberry & White sun tea to drink iced during the warmer months. I make a half gallon at a time and add a quarter cup of sugar and store it in the fridge to drink through the week. The raspberry adds good flavor to the mild white tea. It's also good hot, but I prefer it iced. I get this once a year through the Super Saver program at Amazon which I'm very happy with as it's simple and saves me money. Since I drink a lot of tea, it's a good value.

review/text: Revised 4-2-12<br /><br />I love Stash's Green Tea, and their Chamomile is fantastic. In short, I have always enjoyed Stash teas.<br /><br />I first found this Raspberry & White atrocious, but thanks to a helpful comment I realized that I was allowing this delicate white tea to steep too long. That being said, be sure to not allow this tea to steep for more than a minute, and the water should *not* be boiling. Following that, the tea is most pleasant.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tucker

review/summary: This tea is delicious
review/text: This Chai tea has such a great flavor. I drink it year round. In the summer I make iced tea out of it and always keep a container in the refrigerator. Once it cools off outside and I need to warm up I switch to hot tea. I've tried several other brands and always come back to this one. My grocery store stopped carrying the decaf version which I like since I drink so much iced tea in the summer, so I'm happy to see it on Amazon.

review/summary: THE ONLY TEA I DRINK!
review/text: Like others, I too have a big issue with caffeine.  And, most decaf teas are dull. Even the other Chai Teas (in other brands) didn't taste as good as Stash's Chai Tea decaf does.  So, this is the only tea that I drink!  It starts me off every morning.  I add 3 packets of the Natra Taste sweetener and some milk and it's just delicious!<br /><br />I love the flavor.  I do not find it heavy in clove, or cinnamon or anything.  I find this a very nicley well-balanced, flavored tea.  Of all the Chai Teas on the market (reg. or decaf) I love Stash's blend the best of all.<br /><br />I was buying it regularly at my Safeway grocery, and then for some reason, it just wasn't around anymore. In fact, there wasn't any decaf tea at all in the store.  Geez!  So, then I went over to the Giant (a longer drive), and was buying it there.  Suddenly, it's not there anymore either. Geez!<br /><br />Thank God I found it on-line.  So, these people have me now as a loyal customer and I hope this is going to be available for a long, long time.

review/summary: First Time Tea Drinker
review/text: I never drank tea before, then a friend bought me a Chai Tea latte.  I liked it.  I didn't know what brand would taste the most like what was bought from this coffee/tea stand.  I liked that Stash has a decaf, because I intended to have it as an evening drink so I went with that.<br /><br />Day one, I didn't steep it long, yet it tasted very strong.  I added skim milk as that is what I use, which did not help it along since it's not rich, also I added sugar as it's supposed to be a sweet drink.<br /><br />Day 2, I bought regular soy milk, no low fat or no vanilla soy since the tea has vanilla.  I didn't steep the tea as long, I used a bit more water, then added 1/4 of a cup of soy milk along with 2 good sized teaspoons of sugar.  It tasted perfect! I think I could probably reuse the tea bag today for my 3rd cup!<br /><br />Reviews can be off when people do not use a product properly, and maybe other users are used to a different brand, as I have seen other brands with different ingredients.  I'm happy with it, to where I don't feel the need anymore to try another tea, since at first, I thought I may have to.  I have a local store that sells items at a good price.  18 bags were $2.69, so I have no reason to buy it in bulk online.  I think I'd save 8 cents on a 3 month supply, then there's shipping.

Previous posters are right:  it's a delicate brew that should be steeped only for up to a minute (two if you're brave) in sub-boiling water.  Any longer brings out a strong bitter taste thanks to the very young tea.

review/text: I gave up coffee a little more than a year ago, and have been, shall I say adventurous in my pursuit of an alternative. I've become a fanatic tea drinker, and find that only those with natural ingredients are worthy. Stash makes a phenomenal lemon ginger tea- but this chocolate hazelnut, although full bodied, leaves a bad taste in my mouth- an aftertaste, that is. I believe it has to do with the fact that it has natural "flavors". No real chocolate or hazelnut here folks. I gave 3 stars because of the quality of the tea.

review/summary: Love the Flavor
review/text: Stash Chocolate Hazelnut tea is my new favorite variety (and I drink a lot of tea). I bring the water just to the point where it starts to boil and then I pour. I let it steep for about 3 minutes and drink it hot. I added a half packet of stevia and a dash of milk to this tea and loved the results. It tastes rich and smooth and for me is a great substitute for hot chocolate. I could definitely taste the chocolate, but the nut flavor was less noticeable. I especially like that it's decaf, so I can drink it in the evenings while I'm relaxing with a book. I haven't tried it iced or without milk, but I plan to. I've tried other Stash teas and thought they were superior to most other brands I've tried.

I think most of the reviewers who hated it already had their own favorite vanilla-nut tea and found this tea different from what they expected?<br /><br />I usually dislike Stash Teas, but this flavor is just so pleasant and homey. Add some sugar and milk and it's a real treat. I agree with the reviewer who found it reminiscent of hot cocoa. It does have a tiny chemical smell, or maybe that's the vanilla. I have a poor sense of smell. It's a very cozy winter tea, but I like it too much to not have it all year 'round.

My idea of coffee is a wonderful smell in the morning that I will make and add to a latte or I guess I mean a chocolate/coffee smoothie that I make at home.  This one suits that bill.  It is a full flavor to me or strong.  I believe it would even make a second cup if I so desired.<br /><br />Would I pay a huge amount for it?  No, I think this coffee is relatively expensive. There are only 15 pods in the box and it happens to have Marley on the box.  Is that the reason for the cost or is pod coffee just expensive?<br /><br />Since I don't have a pod machine I boiled a cup of water and added it to the pod in a cup with a spoon holding it down.  Worked well for me.<br /><br />Good coffee but not worth what they want for it.

review/summary: convenient, low-acid, but a bit weak
review/text: The first thing that hit me is that these appear to be a low-acid gype of coffee....I didn't get that icky feeling some coffees give you after you drink them.  That is a definite plus.  But the coffee itself isn't that strong either.  I'm not into Kona or really deep flavors, I like just a medium blend.  But this still seemed weak.  It almost came across as coffee-tea than a strong cup of joe.<br /><br />I don't think I'd order this particular blend again.

review/summary: Mild breakfast type coffee/tea
review/text: I had never used these coffee pods before and used them in my coffee maker without a filter.  I was really expecting the coffee to smell great when it was brewing, but maybe it is to mild.  If you like milder breakfast type coffee or chai tea you will love this coffee.  I added a little light cream and it was very good, be careful with the cream it needs very little.  My first cup I put to much light cream and it overpowered the drink.  I would buy this again, it is something nice to give as a gift or serve to company.

review/text: . . .A little fussy about my coffee, and this coffee did not disappoint me.  It has a rich flavor, I can control the strength by adding or substracting the amount of water I use (which you can do wih all coffees, I know).  The flavor - although I cannot pinpoint the difference, is very nice.  I'll definitely be buying more of this brand and I think that's probably the best review I can give it - I want more.

review/text: I'm still not a food reviewer. The problem is that I can't turn down free coffee. That said, this is good stuff, mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store. I subtracted one star from the review because of the ridiculously pretentious ad copy on the box. Drinking this coffee won't fix the world or make your life more fulfilling, I'm fairly sure.

review/summary: Roast is too dark for  a Yirgacheffe
review/text: While the roast is  described  as medium it is actually a nice but slightly bitter dark roast which is completely without the promised floral notes that are expected in a good Yirgacheffe Ethiopian coffee. A true medium roast would have preserved the floral and fruity notes that are present in a good Yirgacheffe.  Otherwise, this is an OK feel good coffee for Senseo and Senseo compatible pod cofee makers.  It is both Fair Trade and Organic certified and promotes or sponsors the coffee kicks charity while trading on the Marley name.  However, there is a lot of necessarily sturdy packaging which blunts the organic and sustainable claims for me.  As is standard for Senseo pods, each pod has only enough coffee for 5-6 ounces of strong  coffee. Use two for a mug if you prefer strong coffee.

review/summary: A tasty treat
review/text: We saw that some of the coffee reviews said that the coffee was weak when "teabagged."  We put a few pods of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOLXM">Marley Coffee One Love, One Heart</a> into our old-fashioned stovetop percolator and let the steam do its magic.<br /><br />Yum. Great flavor, and strong enough. Even though I prefer my coffee whitened and sweetened, I was surprised that I enjoyed the Marley Coffee black. This coffee was great alone, and would probably do well as a mixer for cooking or alcohol recipes.<br /><br />Next time, we may experimentally open the pods and try the in the Keurig; however, we *were* satisfied with the percolator.

review/text: First of, I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered this coffee.  Come to find out the "single serve pods" are flat, round cushions that require a special coffee maker.  I own a Keurig and Eco-Brew refillable cups that I really like, so I decided to open the pod and dump the grounds into the Eco-Brew cup instead.  It worked like a charm, and on the 6cc setting I got to enjoy a very bold brew with no aidic aftertaste.

review/text: One Love is a good, robust coffee - if you like a strong coffee in the morning, you should like the flavor. Honestly, I didn't really catch the hints of exotic floral and berry they advertise which is just as well as I enjoy a basic coffee. The single serving pods are handy but you can also use a couple in a regular machine and it works just fine as well. If you're environmentally concious, it is free trade certified and organic.  Partial proceeds are also donated to the charity kicksforcause.org.  Overall an enjoyable cup of coffee with decent flavor.

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: Well, I wasn't bright when I ordered this coffee and for some reason I thought it came in both single servings and pods. I had to tear the pods open and use just the coffee and that way, it is EXCELLENT coffee. Rich and dark, I really like the flavor. My only complaint is, no, they're not easy to open packets, I have to use scissors and really, does it need all that wasteful packaging? But the coffee itself is very good, though I don't know all the fancy words for describing coffee, I like strong flavor with caffeine, usually choosing medium roasts and this fits the bill.

review/summary: This Coffee is Not Bad
review/text: This package of Marley coffee contains a bunch of "pods" designed for pod coffee makers. Look them up and boggle at the prices. I do not have one so my first try was with my French press - the purest way of making coffee. I put one pod into it and poured in a large cupful of almost boiling water. After poking it around for a while and leaving it to sit, I got a blackish coffee which tasted a bit weak.<br /><br />For my second attempt I cut open two pods and emptied the ground coffee into the press. The resulting coffee was quite strong, but as a quasi-European (English) that's the way I like it.<br /><br />What to say about the flavor? It was mild (no harshness) and fairly pleasant. The coffee in Denny's restaurants is better though.

review/summary: Weak but okay
review/text: Brewing Machine: Philips Senseo<br /><br />First thing I noticed was that the packet contained noticeably more coffee than my Senseo pods.  I thought great, I can use just one to brew my double serving cup.  Wrong, very weak when brewed that way.<br /><br />Second, tried to brew two servings at once, but two pods were much too large to fit in the two serving Senseo pod holder.  So, I used the single pod holder and brewed one cup at a time.  What a hassle.<br /><br />Taste wise, the coffee is okay, it tases sort of weak for my tastes and doesn't have a lot of flavor, and the price per pod you might as well buy Star Bucks (or favorite coffee house coffee).  I will keep using my Senseo dark roast pods which I think have better flavor and are much cheaper.

review/summary: Needs more instruction but we figured it out
review/text: Marley Coffee is an interesting product which comes in a tasteful display box/dispenser, and proves that one can have fresh rich coffee just about anywhere without dedicated coffeemakers or pod machines.<br /><br />Maybe the "One Love" variety is meant for two cups per "single serve" bag, or perhaps one is supposed to do something more than to "Stir It Up" little darlin', as recommended on the box (in homage to the song.)<br /><br />There wasn't instruction on the packaging on how to get the brew right with these large "tea bags" of coffee. The only thing clearly marked was which side of the bag should be faced down in the cup.<br /><br />The coffee has a good taste, but the first bag I tried brewed up so strong it gave me the jitters. Good thing there are 15 individual plastic-sealed bags in the dispenser. My husband fiddled around with them because he likes an occasional cup of joe in the afternoon but doesn't want to brew up a whole pot.<br /><br />I credit him with coming up with the "spoon test" to figure out when the coffee was at the perfect strength. We use a 16 oz. cup because the circumference of the bag is rather wide for our 12 oz, and we pour boiling water over the bag which rises to the top as the cup fills. Then we wait for it to steep. After a couple of minutes, he takes a spoon and starts lowering it into the cup just until the bowl of the spoon is completely immersed. When the brew gets dark enough, the bowl of the spoon disappears except for the edges, and then it's done.<br /><br />It's a quality product, convenient, and can save on electricity, as well as not wasting coffee and good water, or adding pods to the landfill. And it's a really nice way to remember Bob Marley, a man of nature from Jamaica.

review/text: We are still on our first box of this, but so far we love this coffee at home. We have a Senseo coffee machine, and we were unsure if it would work for us, but it fits perfectly. The coffee is organic, no artificial ingredients like some of the other ones have (including the ones recommended by Philips!) Size wise, each coffee pod is quite thick, I would equate it to 1.5 times the Senseo ones. Smells and tastes great. I am not the biggest coffee drinker, but the ladies in the house love it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I am a coffee lover and usually enjoy a strong cappuccino in the morning.  I tried this coffee and was impressed by the aroma and flavor.  It is not too strong but has a good not-too bitter flavor.  I really like the pods - so much less mess but these are all individually wrapped!  I know a lot of coffee pods/packets are to keep in the freshness but maybe organic and fair-trade coffee manufacturers could care a little more about the waste produced from individually wrapped items.  Needless to say, I did enjoy my cup of coffee and would buy this product again.

review/summary: Not the best Ethiopian coffee I've had, but pretty darn good for a coffee pod
review/text: Executive summary: not as good as a traditional cup of Ethiopian coffee, but definitely the best coffee pod coffee I've ever had.<br /><br />Several years ago I walked into an Ethiopian restaurant for the first time.  The food was good, but the coffee was the best coffee I had ever tasted.  It was rich and dark and so incredibly flavorful.  It didn't pack a killer caffeine punch, which is good, because I drank a whole pot by myself.  I love coffee and drink it daily, and I've never found another coffee that came close, except at another Ethiopian restaurant.  It's my understanding that coffee originated in that region, which may have something to do with it.  (If I'm wrong, sorry--I'm not a historian.)<br /><br />While I looked forward to this coffee, I was pretty sure it wouldn't be as good as the coffee in the restaurants, made in the traditional way.  I was right.  Still, this is the best coffee I've had from a coffee pod.<br /><br />It was rich and dark, as I expected.  The scent that was released when I opened the packet was wonderfully deep and complex.  The first cup, made from the pod, was very good, if a little bland.  The smell while it brewed turned a little unpleasant near the end, for some reason, but it faded quickly and wasn't present in the brewed coffee at all.<br /><br />I took out the coffee press for the second cup, and cut open one of the pods.  (I don't recommend this, since the grind is far too fine for a coffee press.)  The coffee made this way was much richer and more complex, and the scent while it brewed was sweet and tempting.  Two cups of this coffee didn't give me caffeine shakes, so caffeine levels seem about average.<br /><br />If it matters to you, this is Fair Trade Certified coffee and some profits are donated to Kicks For Cause Foundation, which supports youth soccer programs.

review/summary: Wonderful aroma, delicious taste
review/text: This conveniently-sized pod fight perfectly into my Senseo machine, and brewed up a first-rate cup of coffee.<br /><br />From the moment I opened the recyclable packaging, the wonderful coffee aroma assured me I was in for a treat. The flavor didn't disappoint. Smooth, complex, and rich, with a subtly floral note, this coffee was head and shoulders about my usual Senseo pods, and in my opinion, far superior to the burnt and bitter notes of a certain overpriced but popular coffee chain.<br /><br />A fair trade product that donates funds to a children's soccer charity (rather than turning a blind eye to child labor), Marley Coffee is a morning cup you can enjoy with a clear conscience.<br /><br />Normally, I drink more tea than coffee, so I don't consider myself an expert, but I know what I like, and for me, Marley Coffee was definitely a treat. I received a free sample for review, but I'll definitely be purchasing my next box.

review/text: This coffee comes packaged in individual filter pods, as shown in the product image. I don't have an individual pod coffee maker, so I put this in the filter area and set the pot to make a single cup, and it worked fine. Unlike other pod coffees I've tasted, which are weak and watery, this has a good coffee flavor. A nice medium blend, it has a unique flavor, and isn't bitter/acidic. However, those looking for a dark or super strong jolt should try one of the other roasts. Overall, a good, easy to make, cup of coffee.<br /><br />According to the box, the Marley Coffee company's products are organic, USDA certified, Fair Trade, and child labor free. In addition, some percentage of the profits are donated to children's soccer programs.

review/summary: Marley One Love Organic Coffee
review/text: I have not always been a coffee drinker but have recently begun to enjoy a cup or two per day. Since my son is the only other person her that drinks coffee and he usually drinks the entire pot by himself, I tend to use the store brand or Maxwell House single serve coffee that is used in the same manner as a tea bag. I am not certain that is the intended use for the Marley single serve coffee pods. I don't have a single serve coffee machine although at times I vacillate about buying one, so I'm not sure what the pods for the machines that use them look like. The Marley coffee pods may be intended for use in one of these machines; however the package and the item page do not specify how they are to be used other than single serve. I brewed them in the same way I brew my usual coffee by heating the water in an electric kettle and letting it steep in the cup until I think it has brewed long enough. It seemed to work just fine.<br /><br />As far as the taste, I enjoyed my coffee. It had a somewhat bitter smell but I was happy to find that it did not have a bitter taste. In fact it was fairly smooth tasting. My son also tried a cup and said it was okay. He likes his coffee so strong that most other people can't drink it so I wouldn't go by his opinion. He did mention that he thought it was too expensive. I guess it would be expensive for someone who drinks as much coffee as he drinks. He could finish a box in a couple of days.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />1. This coffee is very tasty and perfect for those who only want one cup at a time.<br />2. This coffee is a good choice for those who prefer organically grown, fair trade coffee.<br />3. This coffee also supports the Kicks for Cause Foundation with partial proceeds going toward youth soccer programs.<br />4. I doubt that I will purchase any of this coffee but that is because I am not a coffee purist and tend to be satisfied with less expensive blends.

review/summary: Organic Medium Roast One Love
review/text: Delicious medium roast coffee made of 100% Arabica beans, grown in Ethiopia by a very conscious company.  This company exists in an area where child labor is prevalent; they however, insist the children of laborers go to school.  That says a lot!<br /><br />The coffee itself is not a blend that will give you a morning jolt, it is a medium blend with berry and floral overtones, which we had a difficult time tasting, but it does have a nice flavor and would be great to serve to guests or for a special occasion.<br /><br />I find it rather difficult to review an item such as this, as taste is so subjective.  However, both my wife and myself find this to be a premium coffee that has a slightly different taste than that which we are familiar. I am not saying that in a negative way, just to let you know that it will be something a bit different.  It is enjoyable and believe it can be well recommended for most coffee drinkers.<br /><br />The company itself must be commended for its treatment of workers, sustainable crops and its contributions to kids organizations in that area.<br /><br />Stir It Up!<br /><br />Ed

review/summary: Excellent coffee, upscale packaging but lacking in description
review/text: Most attractive and functional packaging (individually foil-sealed pods) but while it wasn't hard to figure out the usage once I had them, it certainly was a mystery what exactly they were going to be prior to their arrival. Please note I would have expected the product description to give me some idea of whether this is produced for a single serve maker and if so, for which one(s).<br /><br />I am using single pods in my Senseo brewer, to make small cups (4 oz.) and am finding this most satisfactory. But in order to brew these larger-than-standard pods, I do have to use the 8 oz (two-pod) holder. No problem (as Marley would say). I do my usual routine of wetting the pod prior to brewing. Figure I deliberately make a strong cuppa; that would be my preference. It tastes great. I agree with the description of floral and berry, a very smooth, non-acidic cup of coffee.

review/text: I'm by no means a a coffee expert, but I do drink a ton of it every day.  I do have sensitive tastebuds, and can tell the differences and nuances between a Starbucks Sumatra and a Dunkin Donuts dark roast.  My taste ranges mostly for medium to strong flavored coffees.  This coffee is on the medium side of the flavor spectrum, and it's free of the sourness found in some store brands.  I would call it a mild medium, and I like the portable package as a way to break up the monotony of what's offered at the office.  I can keep a pack or 2 in my desk drawer whenever, as the individual wrapping for each pod is quite handy.  There's nothing terribly distinctive about it- just a clean tasting coffee.  I will say this- I prefer it over the Starbucks Sumatra offered at work.  Recommended.

review/summary: Good flavor, but weak
review/text: There's more about Bob Marley on these coffee packets than brewing instructions. There are quotes, inspiration, attitude, very nice rendering of a lion, and the man himself holding his impressive locks.  But machine compatibility? Light/med/dark roast? Recommended cup size.  Ah, no.<br /><br />I found that one pod fit the 2-pod holder of my Senseo. Two Marley pods were too large for the 2-pod holder of the Senseo.  I brewed two separate cups, using two pods this morning, but there was no caffeine jolt in this coffee.  A single pod gives a delicious, but slightly weak cup.  Two pods give a very "Starbucks-y" cup of coffee with strong flavor, but without their jolt of caffeine. In fact, I needed a third cup of Marley coffee to accomplish what a perfectly ordinary spoonful of Maxwell House Instant Coffee can do any morning of the week when I am in a hurry (but at a cost of around two dollars).<br /><br />If these folks are serious about coffee, they need to take a look at their competition; more flavor and data, less music.  Unless you're running a caf&eacute;.

review/summary: Smooth cup of coffee
review/text: I've never had a cup of coffee that was so smooth tasting, kind of like when you buy the expensive liquor instead of the store brand. The coffee was a bit on the weak side but I felt the flavor of the Ethiopian yirgacheffe balanced that out somewhat.<br /><br />I bought some of these pods for my sons to use at college. They bring a sealed packet with them in their bookbags when they leave home for the day at school, and get free hot water from the drink vendors on campus for a nice pick me up between classes. They both love the coffee, and the convenience.<br /><br />I did take positive note of the ethically farmed notation on the box, and the fact that this product is certified organic. This company also supports Ital and Kicks for Cause. Nice.

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: This is an astoundingly good cup of coffee!<br /><br />From the scent to the cup this is a great medium bodied coffee with NO burnt beans & NO bitter taste - during or after. The Ethiopia Yiragacheffe is the "exotic floral and berry" blend, yet all I could savor was a brilliant smooth cup of coffee that had absolutely NO need for sugar, honey or cream - it is quite frankly perfect as is. Also easy on the stomach.<br /><br />No instructions, but they are single serve pods made for single serve brewers. As for a standard brewer, compile pods for brewing according to taste. Experiment & enjoy.<br /><br />I shared this with my family, we have a new morning favorite.

review/summary: Very smooth flavor in a convenient form.
review/text: I find this coffee to be very pleasant with very little bitterness or acidity. Since it comes in individual pouches, much like a tea bag, the result is perfectly filtered. There are brewing machines that take such pouches, but I just put it on the bottom of a cup and pour boiling water over it. By adjusting the amount of time that you let it steep, you can regulate the flavor. Most experts suggest only a few minutes, similar to the amount of time a drip method would take. More than that is considered over-extraction that may result in more bitterness and other changes, but it is a matter of personal preference. The foil packs also keep each pod very fresh. It is also very convenient to take to work with you since it is so simple to brew.

review/summary: Very good coffee
review/text: I tried the Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee the day it arrived. I really love the individual coffee "pod" that is so handy and easy to dispose of. The directions suggest using one coffee pod to make an eight ounce cup of coffee. This makes a good cup of coffee with no messy coffee grounds.

review/summary: Smells good, but tastes like coffee-flavored water
review/text: These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help.<br /><br />I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee.<br /><br />I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars.<br /><br />Coffee maker: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a><br /><br />Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system). I put two Marley pods in the maker and made about 12 ounces of coffee, which I ran through the maker a second time (the first time it was very watery looking). The resulting coffee was about three stars good - not very strong, but a fair cup of coffee.

review/summary: A Good company, but the coffee is a disappointment
review/text: I will preface this review by saying that I was positively disposed towards the company before trying their coffee.  They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization "kicks for a cause," a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.  Among the coffees I have reviewed on Amazon, I would say that the Coffee Masters roast <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6O5W0">Coffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> is the best, followed by equal exchange <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UJW">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> and then Marley and Coffee Bean direct. (None as good as Green Mountain, Trader Joes, or several small roasters).<br />It is too bad.  I would like to see companies like this one become successful, as they are doing a lot of good things in the world and their community.  but, in all honesty, this particular coffee is not very good.

review/summary: Not Quite Bold Enough
review/text: I am not a coffee drinker, but my husband has a travel cup attached to his hand. This is his review:<br /><br />The coffee was okay. Very flavorful.<br />My preferred coffee flavor is bolder along the Italian/ Colombian lines so this having a subtle hint of flower flavor was very different.<br />I know this will be a big hit to some coffee drinkers but it is not for me.

review/summary: Five Star Coffee but a One Star Pod
review/text: I nevr tasted 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But this really surprised me. There was none. No taste. Just tan water.  When I put the packet into the pod brewer, what came out was not coffee. I couldn't believe it. Not from Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee. No way, mon.  I didn't name my dog Stanley Marley for nothing.  I'm a believer.  I took another pod, cut it open and poured the contents into a K-cup and gave the Keurig Brewer a try. What a difference.  The fragrance was enough to bring me to my knees.  The taste?  You know how coffee is supposed to taste but mostly doesn't?  That's how it tastes.  Rich, deep coffee notes, almost a smokiness, but not heavy...this is a lively brew.  There is a definite that makes you want to gulp the whole cup. But sip it...it's too good to gulp.<br /><br />After that first experiment, I opened 3 more pods and poured the contents into the Boodum.  Not the right grind, so I ended up with tons of grounds in the cup but the flavor? Even better.  That rich coffee taste with absolutely no bitterness, no sour aftertaste. I had the Keurig version black, and tasted the Boodum mug first with nothing, then with regular milk, and then poured a cup and added one scant tablespoon of condensed milk.  All of them were wonderful.  Of course I did not sleep for 3 days, but you have to make sacrifices for the sake of science.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend the coffee, but not the carrier. Don't order the pods, order the whole bean or ground, loose coffee.  This is an excellent brew when it is released from Pod Prison. It has that beautiful deep, almost turkish coffee flavor going for it.  Black it revs you up, but with milk, cream or condensed milk, it is pure sipping pleasure.  This is Sunday morning, sit back, read the newspaper, put your feet up, life is wonderful coffee.  No fooling.<br /><br />And just for the record, one of the reviewers who gave this product a single star felt that it was bitter and too strong.  I don't know what sort of weak-kneed coffee set that standard, but if you are using the pod, there is no way this could be too strong.  The same reviewer also added "flavored coffee creamer" to the cup.  That stuff is just awful. The 'flavors' are crude and artificial and probably made from petroleum byproducts, recycled plastic bags and zoo waste.  Add real cream, no problem. Add flavors...real cinnamon, cardamom, a little red pepper even.  Nutmeg brings out the inner soul of most coffee, it's lovely. If it's a spice and smells like dessert, it will work.  You can melt a cube of dark chocolate in the microwave and stir it in. Even better, smoosh up a Peppermint Patty and pour the coffee over that. Chocolaty, pepperminty goodness that is like Christmas in a cup.  Flavor your coffee any way you like, but not the fake stuff.  But with this coffee, you don't need to monkey around.  It's that good. Just nix the pod.
