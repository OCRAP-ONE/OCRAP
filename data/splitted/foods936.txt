review/summary: Our dogs have eaten this for years
review/text: When one of our dogs was diagnosed with Cushings, Which caused significant weight gain, we tried to find a dog food that would meet her needs as well as that of our much older tiny chihuahua. This is the one they chose as the best of the batch.<br /><br />For several years, both our 4 pound and 12 pound chihuahuas used this as their regular food, both were very happy with it. Eventually, we lost our older dog, and now the younger one is an old lady. We have switched from the weight control to regular, particularly since she has recently lost 30% of her body weight.<br /><br />In the meantime, we have added a younger chihuahua to the mix, and she enjoyed both the weight control and the regular.<br /><br />While some of the ingredients (like beef tallow and chicken by products) sound gross to me, I have to remember I am not a dog, and living in a rural area, I have seen what they think is appetizing. I use cornmeal in many of my own recipes, including tortillas, corn muffins, breaded chicken, and cornbread.<br /><br />Both have remained healthy and required very little dental work.

review/summary: Horrible Dog Food
review/text: We believe it's no coincidence after eating this food for a few months that 2 of my dogs started losing their hair and one died of having (0) blood pressure that was only 6 months old. They were ALWAYS so hungry, beyond normal. We got rid of it, gave it away. One dog eventually grew her hair back, the other one didn't. When you see the beneful food stacked up in Wal-marts you can appreciate what a mass productive product this is.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/03/2012: Finally after a few years one of our min pins started growing her hair back at (11) years of age after losing it a few years ago from this food. We fed her ORIJEN brand (6 fish) from Canada for a while then switched to something called Orgainix from PetCo (Made in USA) which is like $35 a bag, about the same price as the #1 rated ORIJEN. We now have 4 min pins with shiny coats that are healthy and playful.<br /><br />dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/beneful-dog-food-dry/ also rates this as one star<br /><br />Ingredients: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol, meat and bone meal, tricalcium phosphate, phosphoric acid, salt, water, animal digest, sorbic acid (a preservative), potassium chloride, dried carrots, dried peas, calcium propionate (a preservative), L-Lysine monohydrochloride, choline chloride, added color (Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 2), DL-Methionine, Vitamin E supplement, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, niacin, Vitamin A supplement, calcium carbonate, copper sulfate, Vitamin B-12 supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin D-3 supplement, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), calcium iodate, folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite.<br />Fiber (estimated dry matter content) = 4.7%<br /><br />The first ingredient in this dog food is corn. Corn is an inexpensive and controversial cereal grain of only modest nutritional value to a dog.<br />For this reason, we do not consider corn a preferred component in any dog food.<br />The second item is chicken by-product meal... a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste. It's made from what's left of a slaughtered chicken after all the prime cuts have been removed.<br />In a nutshell, chicken by-products are those unsavory leftovers usually considered "unfit for human consumption".<br />In addition to organs (the nourishing part), this stuff can contain almost anything... feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs... anything (that is) except skeletal muscle (real meat).

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/text: I've bought Stonewall's grilling sauces for years, and always found them to be very tasty. My personal favorite happens to be the Pomegranate grill sauce. It's not one of the ones in this package, but quite tasty. I have no idea where the other poster got the "watery" aspect from, as I've always found their grilling sauces wonderfully thick. Anyway, my personal opinion is that they are great.

review/text: I have purchased these several time and enjoy them enough to keep ordering them. The peanut garlic is my least favorite, but I still like it. My favorite is the ginger wasabi, which sounds spicy, but is not. It is perfect for fish, especially salmon! The other two sauces have proved great on the grill with beef or chicken. I thought the consistency was just right, not too thick or too watery. I would recommend these to anyone looking to add some variety to meats they put on the grill.

review/text: I was so excited to try these Stonewall Kitchen Sauces, the flavors sounded worth trying. Boy, was I wrong. I would NOT recommend ANYONE to buy this Sauce collection in any way shape or form, not even if it was FREE! All of the sauces were on the watery side.<br /><br />Roasted Garlic Peanut Sauce- This sauce had a decent Peanut flavor but lacked Garlic flavor, it was a little on the watery side but thickened up nicely once caramelized. It was definitely not worth buying again though.<br /><br />Wasabi Ginger Sauce- This sauce was nothing special at all, it was a terrible mix of Wasabi and Ginger. I threw the bottle out, as it was not worth using!<br /><br />Maple Chipotle Grille Sauce- You cannot taste any Chipotle flavor at all, as the Maple flavor was very overwhelming. It was a decent sauce, but way too sweet.<br /><br />Sesame Ginger Teriyaki Sauce- This is one of the most vial sauces I have ever tasted... First off it was very oily, Second it has one of the those horrible tastes that lingered in your mouth. I had to drink an insane amount of water to get rid of the BAD taste. I could not get past the taste test and threw the bottle out!

review/summary: Wow! Tastes too good to be good for you!
review/text: My father is a heart patient and is on a 2-gram sodium diet, making it a challenge to cook for him. I found Ty's at our local farmer's market, where I was able to sample it. Because I've tried so many low-sodium or no-sodium products that were really lacking, I was skeptical -- but wow!  I was blown away! I enjoyed it on some fresh squash that had been sauteed in olive oil since I don't eat meat, but they also had chicken sprinkled with it that looked absolutely delicious. It's very tasty without being over-powering and it really enhanced the natural flavors in the squash.  I prepared it on a chicken breast pounded out flat (about 1/4") and sauteed in a hot pan (medium-high heat) with coconut oil. I left my chicken about 4 or so minutes per side so that it really crisps up on the outside.  I sprinkled it liberally with Ty's seasoning after turning it and it got rave reviews from all who tasted it. Will definitely try rubbing my chicken breasts with the seasoning next time I fix this, but I was in a hurry. So glad I bought two bags -- one for myself and one for my parents. It will become a staple in both homes.

review/text: I drink only flavored coffee.  Thus far, my favorites are Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee; Timothy's German Chocolate Cake; Van Houtte's Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and Spicy Mayan Chocolate.  The last one was my No. 1 favorite, so I was heartbroken to learn that it has been discontinued. I am currently rationing each precious K-Cup from my very last box of 24.<br /><br />Two days ago, I saw and purchased my first box of Folger's Vanilla Biscotti,  (Who knew that Folger's made K-cups?)  It's too soon to know for certain, but there is a good chance this flavor will make my list of favorites.  The good news is that Target sells it and other 18 count boxes of Folger K-Cups for $10.85.  That means you can buy 36 for $21.70.  Compare that to the greedy sellers on this page who get $48.46 and $43.04 (with shipping) respectively.

review/summary: Average columbian coffee, good but not great
review/text: Had hoped for a really good cup of columbian coffee, and columbian (preferably supremo) is among my very favorites. As I drink 8 cups a day, I've tasted lots of coffees and lots of beans from around the world.  While this is a decent coffee, probably 4 stars when compared to other non columbian coffees, it is not among the better columbian coffees. My guess is that they use a higer percentage of just average columbian beans, and not many supremo beans. The roast is medium, but it is a little more bitter than you might expect for columbian.  I would recommend millstone columbian supremo if you want a good cup of columbian coffee. Supremo is the grade of bean, so if you don't see that you know you are getting a cheaper bean.

review/text: I drink Folgers coffee all the time. The black silk is my favorite.It taste the same as when I buy it at the store in a can but I like the K cups because it is easier. I just wish it did not cost so much. The Folgers is almost twice as much as other K-cups. Folgers needs to bring the price down.

review/summary: Great coffee but a lot cheaper at Wal-Mart
review/text: I ordered this near the end of January when advertised for $19.80 for the same 3-pack along with Prime two-day free shipping. Never received the order. Amazon has sent several emails that the order will ship when product is available and I even extended the open order when requested. I doubt Amazon will fulfill this order now that the price has almost doubled and is over $45 with shipping.  Wal-mart is selling an 18-count pack for about $11.

review/summary: Folgers K-cup Coffee
review/text: Coffee is very much a personal taste choice. My favorite is Folgers Medium Roast Colombian in K-cups. It has a bolder taste than the Green Mountain breakfast blend, but is not overpowering. It is smooth tasting. Everyone has their favorites and this is mine. I was drinking Folgers coffee long before getting a Keurig brewer.

review/summary: I have 6 favorites, this is one of them
review/text: This review is going to get posted in 6 places, as I'm indicating my preferences for 6 different coffees. If you like one, maybe you will like the other.<br /><br />Regarding coffee, I like strong and smooth.  I don't like French roast as I find it too harsh, but I do like Italian roast.  Kona is great and I like Hazelnut, Vanilla and Chocolate flavors.<br />I drink my coffee with probably too much (at least 2-3 creamer containers worth to a 12 oz cup coffee) of evaporated milk in it or plain non-dairy creamer. No sugar.<br /><br />That being said...my favorite coffees are:<br /><br />Green Mountain Hazelnut Dark Roast Extra Bold<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee<br />Newman's Own Extra Bold<br />Tully's Coffee Kona Blend Extra Bold<br />Folger's Gourmet Vanilla Biscotti<br /><br />and a special mention for<br />Timothy's World Coffee German Chocolate Cake - It has an almost coco-nutty taste to it. Not the deep chocolate taste I was looking for, but the best I have found so far. Please if you can suggest a Dark Chocolate Flavor coffee to me; do so.<br /><br />Also since I have posted a review about a Senseo coffee and now clearly have switched to Keurig a bit about why... if you're interested..which why I put it last.  Feel free to ignore it.<br /><br />We decided to get a Keurig coffee maker after enjoying the Senseo system for over 3 years.<br />Please note, since we got the Senseo system essentially free, not much thought was put into it's purchase. However it did introduce us to single serving coffee systems.<br /><br />We switched to the Keurig system from the Senseo for several reasons.<br /><br />1. Local availability of coffee. For some reason the Senseo system was waning here at the Rochester NY grocery stores and what good is a coffee maker without coffee?  Yes, you can buy online, but sometimes when your planning isn't the best, you might run out. What coffee they did carry was limited and not our preferences.<br /><br />2. Online purchases of Senseo coffees  were either for 4 bags of 16-18 of one variety or 4 bags of a mix of coffees. Invariably there was a few you didn't like.  I never saw small quantities of 5 or so.<br /><br />3. The Senseo "duck" for filling  with your own coffee never worked for us.  I'm an engineer and my boyfriend is an inspector. We literally did controlled experiments to get this to work and never could. Maybe we had a faulty unit, but based on reviews here, we were in good company. I knew many that had luck with the Keurig system however and we did as well.<br /><br />4. Once you open a bag of Senseo pods, they are starting to go stale, by virtue of being open to air. The Keurig system's coffees remain sealed and you can have many flavors "open" at once. Yes for those of you that are "green" there is more plastic waste. However I'm being selfish here and am being more concerned with the green in my pocket and fresh coffee.

review/summary: Really good coffee, good to the last drop
review/text: With all the fancy coffee names out there, leave it to one of the old originals to come up with a great k-cup coffee.  I remember when I was a kid at my grand parents watching them drink Folgers coffee.  It was the only kind they would drink.  The old red can.  When I saw this k-cup with the Folgers name on it, I bought it out of nostalgia, as much as anything.  After receiveing it, we loved it, too.  It has a very mild taste and flavor.  Not quite as much "vanilla" as some of the other vanilla flavored coffees out there, but just the right amount.  To re-use an old phrase, it is "good, to the last drop"!

review/summary: Good coffee - Could have been fresher.
review/text: Folgers Gourmet Selections, Lively Colombian Decaf, is good-tasting coffee, as far as decaffeinated coffee is concerned.  I find it is the perfect strength for me. It is between mild and strong. However, the boxes I received from Amazon expired in about a month.  Those I received from Keurig had 6 months expiration, so were a lot fresher.  For the price paid on Amazon, I feel the product should have had a later expiration date.

review/summary: Tastes exactly like my drip Folgers.
review/text: I grew up on Folgers coffee. It was simply the best affordable coffee that could be drank on a daily basis. I was glad that Folgers has formulated there distinct coffee for the K-Cup. A few years ago I did try using folgers ground coffee in one of those <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and it just did not come out right. I have had no luck with the refillable K-Cup with any brand of coffee. I honestly believe that a lot of product testing goes into these K-cups. It's not as simple as fill it up and run water through it.<br /><br />Folgers Columbian  K-cups taste exactly like I made it way back when with my Mr. Coffee. Becuse you are able to adjust the amount of coffee used in the Drip brewers this may or may not be as perfect of a match for your tastes. The one constant is the all important aftertaste. The Extra-Bold Newman's own and Doughnut Shop K-cups have a long, strong aftertaste that I really enjoy but they give you strong coffee breath. By comparison This Folgers has less of a aftertaste which Is nice when you know you will be in conversation with someone.<br /><br />There are many Columbian coffee K-cup choices and in reality they are all good. If you loved Folgers in the past. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Update 8-7-2011<br />I have been drinking this now for well over 3 weeks now and I have to say it is now my new fav everyday coffee. Our 2 mainstays used to be Doughnut Shop by Coffee People <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> and Breakfast Blend by Green Mountain <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> Folgers has replaced Breakfast Blend which is the milder of the 2.  Sooo Good!

review/summary: Tales of a Coffee Snob
review/text: I'm what I refer to as a "middle-level" coffee snob; that is, I don't need a Barista to enjoy a good cup of coffee but I don't drink the plebeian brands (Maxwell House, Folgers, et al), either.  We were in Vermont for the weekend when the hostess of the B&B in which we were staying served a delicious coffee at breakfast.  Inquiring as to the brand, she told us it was Folgers Black Silk.  I couldn't believe that Folgers made such a rich, robust, yet smooth coffee.  As soon as we got home, I went out and bought a can of Black Silk, as well as ordered a box of K-cups from Amazon.  It's every bit as good at home as it was in Vermont.  The object lesson here: "Don't be such a snob; try new brands and varieties...some of them might pleasantly surprise you!"

review/text: This review pertains to the Black Silk only. If you are thinking of skimping on your next K-Cup purchase, read this.<br /><br />No surprise, but you get what you pay for. While many of the other brands of K-Cups say "100% Arabica Coffee" on the side of the package, these merely say, "100% Coffee" - so you know there's gotta be some Robusta in there somewhere. I'd say the flavor is OK if you enjoy the free coffee at your local car dealership while waiting for a repair. Maybe even a step up to "diner coffee." Not terrible, but definitely leaves a burned aftertaste in your mouth. These were OK to try, but I would spend the extra pennies for better quality K-Cups in the future.

review/summary: It's my goto morning cup
review/text: I do not drink fancy coffee.  I do not own a burr grinder or an espresso machine.  I do like to fill up my Contigo cup for the commute to work.  I find that Folgers makes a smooth cup of coffee to drink on the way to work.  I actually use 1 3/4 of water to brew mine so it fills my cup to the top.  A single pack of sweetener and I'm off to work.  I purchased 3 of these 36 count packs because it was cheaper than picking them up from Walmart ($10.87 + tax for 18 count)

review/summary: Definitely the tastiest of the Folgers K-Cups
review/text: Given that Folger's is basically "supermarket coffee" rather than any kind of gourmet blend, I was surprised by how good the Folger's K-Cups were.  So far, I've tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IREFJI">Lively Colombian</a> as well as these, and I definitely like these the best.  They're not as good as the extra bold flavors from Green Mountain or Coffee People, but if you can get them at a decent price, they're worth trying.  If you can get the GM or CP brands for about the same price, you'd be crazy to buy these.

review/summary: My favorite
review/text: I recently purchased a Keurig and of course wanted to have a variety of coffees and teas to try. I searched and found several coffees and this was one of them.<br /><br />I can honestly state that this is my favorite by far. The flavor is subtle, but clearly there. It smells fantastic and I will be purchasing again for sure.<br /><br />Pros: Aroma/taste<br />  Price-you get three boxes<br />  Shipping<br /><br />Cons: None in my opinion<br /><br />Overall I will absolutely buy this product again, and will reccommend and share with my friends.

review/summary: Surprisingly tasty coffee at a nice price
review/text: Let's face it - "Folgers" isn't a name that usually springs to mind when you think of great coffee, but this isn't bad.  Nice aroma, a balanced blend that's not too strong, but still provides plenty of flavor.  Give it a try if you're tired of overpriced K-Cups that cost almost what a coffee shop would charge.  Mrs. Olsen would approve.<br /><br />UPDATE: my review was based on a purchase price that figured out to 46.5 cents per cup.  They were worth trying at that price.  The current price of 65 cents a cup puts them in the same price-range as gourmet brands like Green Mountain or Coffee People, and they're not even close to the same quality as those brands.  If you can find them for under fifty cents a cup, they're worth trying.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.

review/summary: Nice option, especially when you need to surve a variety of tastes in a hurry
review/text: My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. So far, I like Folgers the best.<br /><br />FOLGERS GOURMET<br />SELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIAN<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)<br />Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.<br /><br />WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROAST<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)<br />A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burnt<br />and papery flavors.<br /><br />TIMOTHY'S DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUM<br />Price per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)<br />A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Folgers Kcups - Messed up packaging
review/text: I got my most recent 3 pack product in April and two of the three boxes had kcups that had expanded - I mean that the bottom was round and puffed out.  When put in the Keurig, a couple of them popped at the top and spritzed/leaked coffee out of the keurig and onto my counter.  The others crumpled when used.  We pay a lot of money for kcups and I encourage you to check all three boxes when you get them to make sure they are normal.  I am wondering what kind of extremes the packages are subjected to in storage and/or transit.  One of the three boxes had all kcups as they should be (sealed tight, flat bottoms).  When I reorder, I will check each box and return any with the defective packaging.<br /><br />Folgers Black Silk Kcup coffee is smooth, flavorful and doesn't get buried when you add milk (latte) or cream.  Delicious!

If you exclusively like bold coffees, you may want to look for other options.  However, this is a good medium blend coffee and is a pretty decent price (beats any coffee chain).  I still prefer the Vanilla Biscotti from Folgers to this one, but I know not everybody enjoys flavored coffee.

The base notes of the coffee itself are fine, but the flavoring has a very odd taste to it- sort of plasticky.  It doesn't taste like other vanilla or dessert-flavored coffees I've had before, and I'm a fan of most flavored coffee.  I'll try the other Folgers flavors to see if they are better, but in the future I will be giving this one a miss.

review/summary: A Lovely Cookie Worth Sharing
review/text: These cookies are nothing like the ones I ate when I was 11, at the lunch table while sitting next to Nancy. These Double Chocolate Chunk cookies are exquisitely kind to the senses, but bring no memory of my fifth grade dream girl. Her pleasant eyes would assuage a long morning's pain in Miss Charminker's class, but it was the meting of her chocolate chip cookies that met my heart.<br /><br />Betty Crocker's cookies are worth sharing too, all of these years later. Made in the oven, they are almost like homemade, almost like the ones Nancy's mom made. Twelve come in the bag if you bake them right. The subtle, bright sweet aroma tinctured with the bold, yet faint milk chocolate scent, captured in a classic cookie enraptured my senses, as they will yours. But, still, the crusty stale, brown-white cookies Nancy shared with me in my youth caused me to smile far more, with a deeper gladdening. She'd lift them gingerly from her brown bag, place one precisely in front of me, on the table, and one in from of her, on the table. She would then proceed to excavate the treasures within, and side-by-side we would eat our lunches until the bell rang.<br /><br />If you don't know Nancy or her equal, then I suggest you buy the Betty Crocker cookies. They'll taste better than most of the cookies you'll've eaten, and maybe you'll sit next to someone nice at lunch to share them with. Be sure to share. If you do, she might sit next to you tomorrow.
