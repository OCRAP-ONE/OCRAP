review/text: Love the coffee,,,, especially if you enjoy your coffee light.... a good cup of coffee in the afternoon when you need a boost but not a heart palpitation.  Very tasty, light and refreshing.  Would recommend to all interested for a slight elevation of your senses in that afternoon "down" that each and every one of us can relate to.  P.S.  no picture.... no one needs see me at my lowest ebb.

review/summary: The best French Vanilla Coffee
review/text: I am not a great fan of flavored coffee BUT keep this in.  This is smooth balanced low acid coffee that I can enjoy good day or night.  The solid French Vanilla flavor does not overpower the coffee taste.  Nor is it overly sweet, a problem I have found in some of the other brands.

Also, I put it through the Keurig twice (if you lift the lever just a little bit, you can re-brew without re-piercing the cup), and it makes the perfect cup of coffee.

review/summary: Tastes great!  Packaging leaves something to be desired
review/text: First the 2 bad things.  I've tried the Starbucks/Fontana and Ghirardelli both and the packaging on the Monin is very poor in comparison.  The plastic is thinner and actually broke during shipping.  It looks like the end where the lid is was hit and it pushed the lid into the bottle and cracked the top of the bottle.  Luckily it was a tiny crack and it barely leaked any at all.  The second packaging issue is that the standard sauce pumps won't work with this package, forcing you to buy their particular pump.  In this case I simply poured it into an old Starbucks jug that I have a pump for, which solved both problems at once.<br /><br />Now the good thing.  I've tried the Starbucks/Fontana and Ghirardelli both and this is 10x better than either one of those.  There's really not even much of a comparison.

review/text: I have never reviewed anything other than computer parts before because I didn't think it was worth my time.<br />I ordered and tried this marmalade on a whim based on one review here and others on the web and because the marmalade was so inexpensive. I have never had such a good marmalade.  If you taste this side by side with other brands, King Kelly is both less bitter and less sweet at the same time if that makes any sense.  It is as if others are trying to cover up their bitterness using sugar while this one reduces the bitterness and lets the other bright flavors shine through.  If you are wondering how you will go through six jars like I was, Google "Orange Marmalade Chicken" or "Grilled Orange Marmalade Sriracha Wings".  Enjoy.

review/summary: A Tasty but Overly Sweet Orange Marmalade
review/text: Ever since Trader Joe's dropped the Dundee brand of  UK made orange marmalade for their own brand some months ago, I have been looking for something to replace it. Trader Joe's new brand was also made from Seville oranges, but made in Canada, not the UK. The taste and texture didn't work for me. The mail order prices for the Dundee and other British brands were too high because of the added shipping. I came across the King Kelly brand with its good reviews and reasonable price, and so decided to try a case of six jars. Unfortunately, this brand also does not work for me.<br /><br />1). This orange marmalade is tasty, with a good orange taste, but will be too sweet for those preferring bitter British style marmalade made from Seville oranges. Also, this marmalade is somewhat more syrupy than thick. First time out of the jar the marmalade dripped off my toast.<br />2). The rim of the jar cap lists the ingredients but for nutrition values you need to call  an 800 number. Ingredients include "inverted sugar" and corn syrup. Corn syrup is a negative for me. As for the inverted sugar, which has been around for over 125 years, check Wikipedia.<br />3). Poor packaging resulted in receiving one broken jar, creating a mess within the package. The jars came doubled boxed, but the inside box had no separation between jars. The jars were bagged together in flimsy bubble wrap, which did not prevent the jars from banging together during shiping. The surprise is that only one jar arrived broken within this careless packaging.

review/text: We tried other brands of orange marmalade, but they were not as good as King Kelly Orange marmalade. We moved from the NW to the SW a few years ago and had trouble finding this brand in any of the local stores. Was delighted to find it on Amazon and Prime eligible!! Each of the six jars was individually wrapped in bubble wrap and then placed in a shipping box with 'air bags'. All arrived just fine...no breakage at all!! Now we are able to enjoy a brand we had been using before our move.

review/summary: Low calorie and refreshing but some ingredients controversial
review/text: I don't have a problem getting my 8 glasses of water each day but I sometimes like a little beverage diversity and individually packaged drink packs are a good way to add a bit of a kick to water. Because these are individual packets, it is easy to keep a few in a gym bag, work desk or purse. I think the flavor is decent.  The lemonade flavor, in my opinion, is not as good as Wyler's pink lemonade or iced tea with peach.  I purchase Wyler's lemonade at my local grocery store for about 10 cents a packet.<br /><br />Some individuals may be concerned to know that this product has aspartame and acesulfame potassium. A lot of diet beverages, including powdered beverage sticks, use these additives. Both have been linked to cancer in rats and both were deemed one of the top ten worst additives by the Center for Science in the Public Interest. So, if you are cautious about additives in your food, this product may not be for you. A serving for this product is 1/2 of a packet and 1/2 of a packet has 5 calories and 20% of your daily vitamin C. To make a full, sufficiently flavored 16 ounce glass, you really do need the entire packet.<br /><br />For proper dissolution of the powder, it is best to follow the recommendation on the box and place the powder into something that can be shaken.  Some companies make products that dissolve pretty well when stirred with a spoon or straw.  This product is not one of them.<br /><br />If you are seeking an alternative product that does not utilize these controversial ingredients and has more vitamins, I would recommend the powered beverages that are made by NOW Foods, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I573FS">Acai Lemonade Sugar Free Drink Sticks 1.7 oz sticks 12 Sticks</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I58XNO">Sugar Free Drink Sticks Pomegranate Berry 12 pckts</a>. (The company actually has several other flavors but I wouldn't recommend them at present.)  NOW's flavored beverage packets are somewhat pricey but can be found more economically off of Amazon (iherb.com and at local health food stores).  Now's Acai Lemonade, which is my favorite, has 15 calories and is loaded with vitamins. It has 100% of you daily vitamin C, 25% of Vitamin A, 50% of Vitamin D, 50% of Vitamin E, 50% of Thiamin, 50% of Riboflavin, 25% of Niacin, 50% of B-6, 50% of Folate, 50% of Pantothenic Acid and 1670% of Vitamin B-12.<br /><br />Wyler's Light Lemonade is flavorful, easy to pack and can be very economical. Those who want to avoid sugar substitutes may want to use this product in moderation or steer clear.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.

review/summary: My Favorite Granola
review/text: I can't say enough good things about this granola.  I first tried it in Vermont at the Walking of the Heifers (an event I highly recommend for the fun and good food as well as plenty of samples). Not having planned on going to the event (I was visiting my mother) I did not have much money on my person.  But made my rounds of the free samples at the numerous booths (many of them organic).  This granola was tops in my book.  It is crunchy but not overly hard which I like. I just eat it right out of the bag.  It has a great flavor although not a lot of nuts.  Once I got home I searched everywhere for it and found it on Amazon.  I am still working on the six bags I purchased and plan to buy more when it is gone. Not only is it made in New England it tastes great too.

We have Cavalier King Charles Spaniels that range from 11 to 24 lbs and they are the perfect size for them. Our dogs will seek them out and just lay on the rug or on their pillow just chewing them. They help with plaque, too. Our vet says that all of our dogs teeth look good and we never brush, just give them access to Nylabones, and give them the occasional dental treat.<br /><br />All of our Cavaliers are MAJOR chewers, the kind that will destroy toys, tennis balls, your shoes, phone, etc. As long as we keep the Nylabones accessible, they chew other stuff a lot less.<br /><br />One warning: Stepping on the chewed end of a Nylabone with bare feet in the dark WILL cause great pain and yelling. Those suckers are SHARP. :-D

review/summary: Dog Isn't Into These At All
review/text: I was hoping to save some of my shoes and some money. Rawhides scare me, kongs require effort and increased calories and I had heard good things about Nylabones. My dog will not touch the originals and will occasionally chew on the chocolate one for a couple of minutes. I wouldn't get the value pack before confirming that my dog A. likes Nylabones and B. likes the originals. If you're insistent on getting these and you have a chewer, I would consider going a size up.<br /><br />I ended up getting a naturally shed deer antler - they cost a little more but last a really long time, don't get dirty like nylabones, are odorless and are actual bones so the vast majority of dogs like them. If you can find the ones that are cut through the middle so they expose more marrow - your dog will probably be entertained for longer periods of time. Bully sticks are also pretty much a guaranteed hit, although my boyfriend calls them butt sticks because of the terrible smell. Comment if you find something else that works. :)<br /><br />Update: While the nylabone still isn't his favorite - He does chew the chocolate one a little longer after I took it away and pretended that it was my phone a few different times. It also seems that it becomes more interesting after he chewed the outside lawyer some and gave it some texture.

review/text: I have a five year old Boston Terrier and I have yet to find a toy that he can not distroy. Many toys meet their demise within minutes of being presented. One of the most durable I've found is the Nylabone. It is easy for him to put between his paws and chew and it seems to satisfy the need for him to distroy something. I would much rather keep buying this than having to replace pieces of furniture. These were especially great during the puppy stage, but he still loves them.

review/text: This is the only bone that lasts around my house. It doesn't tear up my dogs gums and they love them. I highly recommend for dogs of all ages. I have a 12 yr old dog and a 2 yr old dog. They both chew on these Nylabones. I saved money ordering these from Amazon versus the local pet stores.

review/summary: Best Chew Toy On The Market
review/text: Nylabones ( the non edible kind) are by far the best chew toys for dogs of all sizes.  They help keep their teeth and gums clean and provide hours of safe chewing enjoyment.<br />They are also a good chew toy in the house, because they do not have messy dies that can stain your floors or furniture.  Everything you give your dog or child, do it so under supervision.<br />  I have not had any problems with Non Edible Nylabones, but I would be saddened if I did not supervise and suddenly a chunk to big to swallow safely came off. It haas Not happened to my knowledge, but I always prefer to be cautious.<br />  Non of this review pertais to the edible kind of Nylabone. I have never used those, so cannot comment on them.<br />MY DOGS LOVE THESE NYLABONES.  I KEEP MULTIPLE STYLES AVAILABLE FOR THEM TO CHOOSE WHEN WE ARE AT HOME WITH THEM.  THEY CHEW ON THEM FOR HOURS. Vet says their teeth look great.

review/summary: French Bulldogs love these things...
review/text: I got this three pack (qty 3) for my 11-month old French Bulldog.  She loves these things, she likes to work on one end of the bone at a time and while holding it up with her front paws.  I was wondering why she loved these things so I took one and actually clamped down on one (rear teeth) and realized that it had a very therapeutic effect...weird, I know.  I gave it back to Coco...<br /><br />For those wondering, she goes through about a bone (grinding down the ends) about every 2 weeks.  I order a bunch and place them in a "jar" and place it in her room.  She knows when to ask for a new one...

review/text: Bought these for my teething 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier and she went to town on them. Last quite a while and pass through my dogs system pretty easily without causing any heavy diarrhea or making her sick. Def recommend this for a teething dog or just a dog who loves to chew (which is pretty much ALL dogs). My silky terrier finds these extremely uninteresting, but she's a picky brat. If your dog will chew on anything with even a slight flavor, these will work out well.

review/summary: Great value for our Italian Greyhound
review/text: We have a 20lb italian greyhound (she's most likely part whippet) who can be a bit finicky about her toys. She mostly loves furry toys with squeakers, but those usually get destroyed within 24-48 hours. The Nylabones are among her favorites, and she's still working on her first one two weeks later. She's even taken it to bed on a few occasions! Definitely a good way to keep your dog occupied for lengthy periods of time. If your dog is much bigger, I'd avoid these smaller sizes, but for dogs under 20lbs, these should be fine.

review/summary: The REAL Stevia
review/text: As I wrote above, this is the REAL Stevia, no additives.  I've used this for years, purchasing at health food stores, organic markets, etc.  However, this is a MUCH better price.<br /><br />I find that there is no aftertaste, though I understand that others do find an aftertaste.  There is absolutely NO effect on blood sugar, as is the case with other sweeteners.  Also, this is 100% natural; it is not man made.  It is produced from a plant grown in South America.  One of the other sweeteners is 'lower calorie sugar'.  I mean, exactly how do you reduce the calories in sugar???  How do they chemically alter sugar???  Does not sound kosher to me, and, er, I don't otherwise worry about food being kosher. Actually, it sounds down right scary.

Good for anyone on a sugar-free or low carb diet.

review/summary: Great Dark Chocolate!
review/text: I love dark chocolate and I don't eat sugar, grains or starches (Paleo Diet).  This is awesome dark chocolate.  Two small squares will satisfy my craving.  You need to be a dark chocolate lover for this chocolate; it is 98% dark chocolate.  This may be pricier than a Hershey bar but it lasts a long, long time.  I keep it in the freezer and break off two little squares when I want something to satisfy a craving.  In the past, I have had very high percentages of dark chocolate that was sweetened with sugar and it wasn't near as good as this dark chocolate.  If you are a funk food junkie, eat a lot of processed sugar and don't like dark chocolate, this would not be for you.  If you are a real dark chocolate lover then this would be for you.

review/summary: A unique and great chocolate
review/text: I have looked for a long time for this chocolate type. I was interested in a sugar free dark chocolate bar sweetened with stevia. Stevia is a natural sweetener,  it has 0 calories and , most importantly, it has 0 effect on your blood sugar levels. So, if you are a diabetic or just having a low carb diet (paleo -diet), this is a chocolate you can indulge in without guilt. And is the only one I know of...<br />Unfortunately, very few manufacturers, if any, know or care to make a stevia sweetened chocolate bar. There is almost nothing out there. 99.99% of commercial sugar free chocolate bars are sweetened with maltitol - a sugar alcohol - which, in spite of being branded as "sugar free" still has a noticeable effect on your blood sugar. Still damages you in this way. So, not really a solution if your goal is to keep your blood sugar low and still enjoy a great chocolate.<br />And so, I am so glad to have found this bar. It is an artisanal chocolate, apparently made by Dante Confectioners in MA. It is a fresh, luscious and rich bar, with a nut flavor finish, and just the right amount of sweetness. It does not have a bitter aftertaste, which is the most common complaint one finds about Stevia. But, you have to love or have acquired a taste for really strong dark chocolate to enjoy this bar. So, all in all, this is a great discovery for me and a delight for the connoisseurs.<br />And, most of all, a welcomed and much awaited product for this market (health conscious chocolate lovers), and, in my knowledge, the only one of this high quality to really provide for all the pleasure and health benefits of chocolate with the lack of detrimental blood sugar side effects and 0 calories of the natural stevia sweetener. A great product!

review/summary: Good quality, but...
review/text: Let me start by saying that these chocolate bars are very good quality, and I love stevia. I love dark chocolate! But I don't know what I'm going to do with these eight bars, because I just don't like them. I use the NOW stevia extract powder brand in my tea and coffee. I have even substituted half the palm sugar called for in a delicious almond flour scone recipe with stevia.<br /><br />That seems to be my problem with many stevia recipes and products out there. Since I am neither diabetic nor overweight, I'm just looking for healthier alternatives to my favorite high sugar foods, most of which are really just treats- like chocolate. Even as a stevia convert, this chocolate tastes overwhelmingly like stevia and the accompanying bitterness about which I have heard so many people complain (and I'm not talking about the yummy, slightly bitter chocolate flavor).<br /><br />The chocolate quality, like I said, is excellent. The product arrived very quickly and in terrific condition.<br />But the flavor would be greatly improved if both sugar and stevia were used. I'm very happy for those who love this chocolate, especially if they are unable to eat sugar and would not be able to eat chocolate otherwise, but... yuck!<br /><br />For people like me- I'm looking for healthier options that also taste good!<br /><br />On a side note- I have read that medium sugar foods don't break down into fat as easily when they are also high in fiber. For example- juice is bad, fruits are good. Juice has had the fiber extracted, therefore it isn't as healthy as fruit, which has fiber to balance. And so maybe the case for a *little* sugar in chocolate (combined with stevia) is more justifiable  because the high fiber would provide balance?<br /><br />Great product for those who would otherwise be unable to eat chocolate:)<br /><br />Updated suggestion: I've been baking with erythritol (a sugar alcohol, that is neither a sugar nor an alcohol, found naturally in cantaloupes, grapes, etc.) with great success. How about a combo of stevia, erythritol and palm sugar? Erythritol can have a diuretic effect if over consumed, but nothing is good for us in large quantities and I've never had a problem!<br /><br />Update #2- Silk has a Vanilla Soymilk Light product that contains sugar and stevia. The resulting product? delicious and very low carb/ sugar. Zevia's line of stevia/ erythritol cokes are also delicious with almost zero carbs. With a little support from regular sugar or erythritol, stevia works outstandingly well and the product isn't anywhere close (carb-wise) to similar, full sugar products. (Doesn't require a whole lot of sugar to make stevia palatable).

review/text: I like the chocolate, but then I also liked dark chocolate to start with.<br /><br />I had a taste for 85% sweetened with sugar, but after enjoying the stevia 98%, I think that 85% tastes a little too bitter. This stevia-sweetened recipe tastes like 70% sugar-sweetened dark chocolate to me. Much less bitter than the really dark sugar-sweetened stuff. It must be because stevia is so much sweeter than sugar when compared by weight.

review/summary: Pretty darn good!
review/text: I was looking for stevia sweetened chocolate while on my candida diet, and this did the trick. This is clearly good quality chocolate--it's smooth and rich in flavor and texture. It's definitely on the bitter/unsweetened-tasting side of the spectrum, so don't buy this with the expectation that it's going to taste like Lindt or Ghirardelli 70% chocolate--this is not that. But if you're dying for chocolate and need something to get you through, I find this works really well. One word of caution--if I eat a half a bar or more, I find it a bit hard to digest. It seems to cause me some gas. I usually don't have a problem with stevia, so I'm not sure why this is happening, but as long as I only eat a couple of squares a day, I seem to be doing just fine.  Definitely worth the money! Oh, one slightly odd thing--it comes wrapped only in tissue paper.<br /><br />Update! 3-27-2012<br />I just bought the Lucienne's 83% dark chocolate sweetened with stevia. By comparison, I have to say that the Dante's chocolate is MUCH better quality. It's richer, with a smoother texture that melts in your mouth. The Lucienne's is comparatively waxy, doesn't melt in the mouth as well, and has a overall less rich flavor. Definitely choose Dante's!

review/text: I'm about to place a second order for this chocolate -- I love it!  The chocolate is high quality and very smooth.  I noticed only a very slight aftertaste when I first tried it, but that quickly disappeared.  For me, this is the best sugar-free option out there, and it fits in perfectly with my eating plan.  You have to be a dark chocolate fan to enjoy this, but I've always preferred dark chocolate, and I seek out those chocolates with the highest concentration of cocoa (at least 87%).  If you love dark chocolate but want to avoid added sugars and sugar alcohols, this is the ticket. The company shipped the product very quickly, and it was well packed for the journey.  With expedited shipping, they include ice packs and insulated wrapping.

Well let me tell you if you have an appreciation for dark chocolate you are going to be pleasantly surprised at just how rich,delicious, sweet and creamy these bars actually are. They taste better than the ones with sugar! Please don't go out of business. We low carb people need companies like you that know how to make low carb taste great! Keep up the good work. I would like to see you come up with different varieties however like dark chocolate with mint oil, with chili peppers, orange peel etc. like some of your competitors who don't even know how to make a chocolate bar as good as you guys.

Just creamy rich dark chocolate goodness.  Seriously, as good as any I've tried.  The folks at Dante's are really nice too.  I had emailed asking if the stevia they used was pure or with additives like erythritol.  I got an actual phone call back from a nice gentleman the next day with the answer - pure stevia.

review/text: The chocolate is great, smooth, almost too smooth because it melts too fast and i dont get to enjoy it for too long. They contacted me warning that it would melt in the heat where i live but i said send it anyway. I thought, hey its in foil packing, so if it melts i will just refreeze it, but when i got it I was worried it would be soft but it was still solid. But then i opened it and it was just wrapped in paper! I have never heard of such a packing method for chocolate. I would have been screwed if it had been hot enough, probably would have been dripping out of the box. I suggest they upgrade their shipping method, but leave the recipe alone, the chocolate is delicious!

Keeping that in mind, this chocolate is the only one I've ever tried that really "works" for me. It does have a bittersweet aftertaste, but I don't mind that at all. I'm always watching my sugar intake, and I can't handle the side effects of the sugar alcohols in so many of the other chocolate products.<br /><br />This chocolate is creamy and satisfying. I find I don't need a whole bar. That would seem like too much. I keep it in the freezer and often eat it with a handful of almonds.<br /><br />I highly recommend this products and this company.

review/text: I got this product because I was on the HCG diet and wanted a special treat for Valentine's Day. I was really hoping it would be good, but it wasn't.<br />This chocolate can be used in cooking I suppose, if you add some additional sweetener to it. It did not relieve my craving for chocolate. It is very bitter tasting. When I tasted a tiny bite, it was just a little bitter. The bar is divided up into blocks. When I put a block in my mouth, it was awful and I ended up spitting it out. It made me think of taking a spoonful of bitter cocoa and trying to eat it.<br />Also, you have to order such a large amount that it is a huge waste if you don't like it. They should sell individual bars so people can know if they like it before buying such a large quantity.

I ate about four little squares per day for the first week and to be honest, I didn't enjoy them very much for the first two days. All I could taste was the stevia. But a strange thing happened which other reviewers have noted. After day three I stopped noticing it and now I'm on my 6th bar (I am a chocoholic) and I LOVE THIS CHOCOLATE! The stevia doesn't bother me at all anymore. I highly recommend this chocolate, especially because it is made with a high cocoa content which provides antioxidants.

I'd do it, but I'm too old and don't have the ambition.<br /><br />So until someone out there gets rich by doing just that, I guess I'm stuck with trying to make my own -  so I bought a stevia cook book on Amazon.

review/summary: Super Stuff!
review/text: I'm with Joe on this one.  I LOVE the stuff!  Spread it on bread and slide it under the broiler for garlic toast.  Use it in cooking when you only need a small amount (or if you're out of garlic cloves OR are too lazy to mince the real thing).  So convient and has a wonderful flavor.

review/summary: I use this every day!
review/text: I am a little bit obsessed with this product. It is that great. I even prefer it to fresh garlic, because it is 5 million times easier to use and distributes over the food more evenly. My only complaint is the price, because I use so much of it. I use it on just about everything. My favorite thing to do is whisk it together with a tiny bit of olive oil in a pan and sautee spinach, arugula, kale, mushrooms, and/or asparagus in it. It is extremely easy and fast--way more so than if I were to use fresh garlic. I just take the tube out of the fridge and squeeze it into a pan! It also spreads very well for paninis. I have tried one other brand of garlic paste and it did not taste strongly or fresh at all compared to this one. I love Amore!
