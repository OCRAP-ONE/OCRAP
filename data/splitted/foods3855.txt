review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I really didn't think there was a BIG difference between the way milk tastes, but after having this one, there really is!  It's really good - it doesn't taste like it is lowfat either. It's a little pricey, but I give it 5 stars because it has helped me out when I ran out of milk for my little one, it is easy to take to amusement parks, and it also gives me peace of mind knowing that I will have some milk around in case of an emergency (earthquakes especially, here in Southern Cali!)<br /><br />The price does fluctuate, so I check it frequently. The best deal was when it was $1.04 for one.

review/summary: I love the convenience, but the taste could be better
review/text: I really love being able to pack organic milk in my kids' lunches without having to fill reused plastic juice bottles like I used to do. When I read about the health risks from phthalates that leach out of plastic, I looked for an alternative and found these prepackaged milks. The only thing my kids and I don't like is the slightly odd taste of the milk, it doesn't seem as fresh and creamy as when we buy it in the grocery store in larger refrigerated containers. I guess there's some kind of sterilization process or something in the packaging that affects the taste. I wish Organic Valley could improve that. Still, we will keep buying this milk for now.

review/summary: Perfect for emergencies!
review/text: Love that this milk is organic and that it does not need to be refrigerated.  We keep some on hand at all times for we forget to buy milk so we can make it until the next day.  Also nice to take to restaurants where they don't serve milk for the kids or for school when you want to make sure they are drinking organic.  Do wish they had other choices other than just 1%, but oh well.  It's a bit expensive for milk, but the price is for convenience.  One thing that I really do like is that Organic Valley still has the larger opening at the top of the milk, because most often we pour this into a spill-proof cup of some sort for the little one.  Horizon milk has changed their packaging so that the hole is just big enough for the attached straw, so if you buy that brand you have to squeeze it into the cup, which doesn't always go as planned!

review/text: We love this milk!  Perfect for lunchboxes!  I love the convenience, the fact its organic AND unflavored, unsweetened, etc.  My daughter loves it, too.  We had been drinking the Horizon milk which was difficult to find unflavored (chocolate, strawberry, vanilla).  Finally we found "plain" (or whatever they call it) and only later realized it's sweetened!  Organic cane sugar, sure, but who needs to sweeten milk!!?  Glad we noticed that and glad we found this.  My daughter was delighted with the switch -- declaring "this tastes like milk!"

review/summary: I love Organic Valley milk!
review/text: I love all of Organic Valley's products. This is white milk.  Not sure what I can say about it other than it's really good.  Even their lowfat milks have a richness about them that makes them seem closer to whole milk.  There is also more flavor there.  Can't explain it.  That's just the way I perceive it.<br /><br />I also prefer to purchase from Organic Valley as it is a cooperative of dairy farmers and not an agri-business such as Horizon, which is part of Dean Foods. (There has also been some debate as to whether or not Horizon's products are really organic.)

review/summary: Comparing to Horizon
review/text: Me and my boys go through a lot of Horizon milk (gallon sized). I don't like the flavored; vanilla, chocolate, etc. and I was looking for a shelf-stable version to keep in our tornado emergency kit. I can't find cases of the horizon, so I decided to take a chance on this one. If you're like me, looking for a good price on the shelf stable milks, and being a fan of Horizon; I would recommend this. At room temperature, I don't think it tastes quite as good as Horizon, but it is VERY close. When cold, I can't tell a difference, they both have that rich creamy taste. My only real complaint is the shelf life isn't very long. I was hoping to be able to keep these for up to 3 months, which is not the case.

review/summary: Great milk - cheaper than the store!
review/text: I have tried over and over to buy these at my local natural grocer, but they are almost always out of stock!  This tells you how popular the Organic Valley milk is, because it's not cheap at that particular store.  They almost always have chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry flavored milk available and then a big empty spot where the plain milk should be.<br /><br />Not only is it less expensive to purchase these through Amazon, but getting a whole case at once means I don't have to worry about my stash of milk for a while.<br /><br />I eat a lot of oatmeal during the week, usually while I am at work.  Instant oatmeal made with water is all right, but instant oatmeal made with milk is divine!  These cartons are just the right size to whip up a hearty batch of oatmeal and don't have to be kept in the fridge.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Tastes great!  Organic Valley milk has a wonderful flavor - to me, it tastes farm-fresh.  Not only are these good for cooking (or making oatmeal), they also are great for drinking when chilled.<br />* Container is recyclable with paper goods in many areas.  Takes up less space than plastic bottles in the recycle bin.<br />* No need for refrigeration, so you can keep a stock in the pantry (or under your desk at work!).<br />* Square shape is easy to store.<br />* Convenient 8 ounce size - small enough to pack in a lunch but big enough so you don't feel like you're skimping.<br />* Buying a case at a time ensures you have a good supply on hand.  Plus, the cost per carton is much lower than it is at the grocery store!<br /><br />Cons:<br />* More spendy than buying milk in a carton, but you're obviously paying for the convenience of a smaller package and non-refrigeration.

I do shake these well before I open them - when I first bought them I didn't, and noticed that the very last drops would have a sour taste. I trust this brand more than their competitor.

review/text: Works great to have at office (no refrigeration) to keep on desk to put in coffee and tea. (Much better tasting than powder creamer of course!) Although it is 1% milk, it reminds me a bit like evaporated milk in that it is a bit richer tasting, so it is just fine and not too watery for this purpose. In normal office temperature on my desk (and away from heat sources, of course), I find I can usually count on it lasting for 2 days when open, (but just through the straw) before it starts to get a bit dicey on the 3rd day. Loved being able to buy it by the case as then I use several per week for this without running out too fast.

That's not the case. This is "Best Used by July 30, 2011" and that date puts it right in the middle of the possible milk contamination in the states. I guess we'll just use this up by July and not drink ANY milk until we know FOR A FACT it's not contaminated (radiation concentrates in milk because of the cow's grazing habits...if you have young children, start planning ahead...please). By July, Organic Valley's milk could be contaminated too! That's why I ordered it NOW thinking I would have 6-12 months until I would need to buy milk and by then we might be safe.<br /><br />I just tried the milk and it's very good! It tastes great! I really wish we had a way to know the expiration dates of items we purchase though.<br /><br />MY suggestion: IF you can find this locally, look at the "Use by" date before you buy it. I'm going to check out our local health food store and see if they carry this and hope they have a longer "use by" date. Or, we'll just go without milk. We have no young kids in the house anymore so I'm not concerned for their health and lack of calcium and vitamin D. If you have babies or young children, you really do need to start doing something about this NOW. All milk products could be in danger in the states....from what I have read. You can do your own research, if you wish, but I believe the people who have told me this WILL BE a concern in the future.<br /><br />You could even stock up on dry powdered milk. That's better than nothing...in an emergency.

review/summary: A beautiful bouquet
review/text: 2008 was a reasonably good vintage for organic milk, but spring storms in the northeast damaged some of the milk vines lessening the overall flavor.  Still the bouquet of Organic Valley recalls flavors of dark cherry and oakwood.  I would recommend the 2006 vintage over this year's blend.

review/text: This season salt truly enhances the flavors of whatever you put it on.  It is less "salty" tasting than other season salts, and has a much more intense flavor.  I would say this is a great example of what other season salts hope to be when they grow up.  :)  I highly recommend this.  Watkins never disappoints.

review/summary: One of My Favorites
review/text: I have been a fan of Nature Valley granola bars for years. They come in many varieties. My favorites lately have been the Pecan Crunch and Peanut Butter bars. So, I was pleased to learn that Amazon now offers the bars in their many different types.<br /><br />Certainly, Oats and Honey are a classic combination. Oats go way back. Samuel Johnson included a definition of oats in his 1755 Dictionary of the English Language. I have adapted liberally from his definition for my title. Actually, Samuel Johnson said: "Oats: A grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland appears to support the people." Little did he know that two and a half centuries later, England's colonial offspring would enthusiastically endorse oats as a food for people.<br /><br />Earlier this month, I spent a week skiing in Colorado at Vail, The ticket counters were equipped with baskets of the Oats and Honey bars provided free of charge. It was a nice gesture considering the almost $100 daily ticket price. The granola bars pack nearly 100 calories for a single bar, and obviously double that for a two-bar pack.<br /><br />I took the Oats bars with me skiing, but I also depend on them for hiking. An extra 200 calories is what you may need to give you enough energy to get up the last 200 feet to a mountain summit. The taste is good. They do not melt. If you get tired of the Oats, there is always a choice: Pecan, Almond, or Peanut Butter, to provide variety.

review/summary: What a great, classic Granola bar at a great price and Quantity
review/text: Buying these awesome Nature Valley Granola bars in this bulk packaging will save you a few dollars ... and every bit counts.<br /><br />I love these granola bars and can hardly get enough of them.  They squelch hunger, bring blood sugar to a decent level so you can think (if low blood sugar is an issue) and are really, really delicious.<br /><br />Bite into one and enjoy the honey taste mixed with oats.  Delicious.  My ONE gripe is the crumbs that are invariably in each pack and will undoubtedly mess up you and your car if you are eating one while driving.  A little messy so I tend to unwrap and eat them in a bowl.  This captures all the crumbs and I do a lot less chasing.<br /><br />I love these bars.  They are a staple around our home and make it into glove boxes, brief cases, backpacks or however we roll at any particular time.  They are a great snack and great appetite fighter.<br /><br />Yummy!

I cancelled the order: The price was way, way too high for the same regular sized box available for much cheaper in the departments stores around here.<br /><br />But, I did later buy a bunch of these little 1 lb boxes in bulk elsewhere online.  A box of this does wonders for my gym locker, and a larger box would not have fit. I also like to keep a little box in the kitchen for dishes in need of hand washing that have an unpleasant odor for some reason.

review/summary: An End in Itself
review/text: Consider this an endorsement of the product. It is a delicious product, ideal with 2% or more milk (no skim) and served in a very large bowl. You can eat a lot of it. I can eat a lot of it. A lot of it is meant to be eaten. The six-pack is just as well because it is extremely difficult to find this cereal in Arizona. I used to feel this price was ridiculous but now, after four months without CLC, it is most certainly fair, and can be delivered overnight by air for you prime members. The prime is an end in itself, to have things delivered in two days for free: that is a lot of products that can make their way to you. It is the world's largest grocery store and bookstore. Everything--the world in all its muchness--is yours for the ordering. I love all of it, the world, these reviews, Amazon and its slightly salacious/campy name, Amazon prime, the website, the other reviewers who gave it five stars, and their children. All these things are beautiful. All these things will fade away. You might as well stock up because you may never be able to leave the house again.

review/text: Some time in the last year or so, General Mills changed this from being an oat cereal to being a corn cereal.  The oat cereal was GREAT, like chocolate cheerios with marshmallows, but the corn version is less chocolatey tasting and has a completely different texture.  It really is much worse.  Also it has gone from 50% RDA of folic acid to 25%, and 1 g of fat to 1.5 g.<br /><br />I wish I had known that before I bought 6 boxes.  Fortunately I still had one of the old boxes (it takes me forever to get to the recycling place!) so I could prove to myself that I wasn't crazy.

Has the same great taste as regular Lucky Charms just that there are fewer marshmellows. The distribution seems to be similar to Crunch Berries.

I love Cocoa Krispies, Cocoa Puffs, Cocoa Pebbles, Count Chocula etc. and was expecting the best of the best with this product, but sadly, we were all disapointed.  The kids won't even eat it!<br /><br />The marshmallows are fine, but the chocolate cereal just doesn't taste good.  I don't know why, but it's just plain bad.  Now I know why these aren't available in stores, at least in my part of the states (So. Cal)<br /><br />After finishing one box, I find myself trying to find friends who might want a box just so we can get rid of them.<br />I wish this item wasn't sold in a 6 pack, I've got buyers remorse!

review/summary: The Tea of Aristocrats
review/text: Having recently been persuaded by several of my closest friends to try a beverage other than coffee, I decided to experiment with several different tea flavors. Although I tired many flavors, I discovered Earl Grey to be among my most prized favorites. This elegant tea dose not boast a subtle flavor, rather, it has many very noticeable and expertly blended flavors that demand to be noticed. Overall, there is a definitive taste inherent in most regular teas but underneath this strong and invigorating flavor there is a more subtly interwoven element of citrus and perhaps a smoky flavor as well. Because of these complementary tastes and the overall flavor they combine to make, I found this tea to be most satisfactory. It should be savored, steaming in a cherished red mug, while sitting beside a roaring fireplace with a cozy kitten snoring in a basket, the picture of utter feline contentment rolling off her in warm luxurious enveloping waves, while you indulge in a favorite book as you curl beneath the old family quilt as layers of snow cascade from the sky outside in the frigid night air. It is the quintessential tea for the most cozy of occasions and should be savored to the last drop.<br /><br />A NOTE ON BREWING : Because of the strong and sometimes bitter nature of this tea, it should not suffer over brewing! I find that it is best brewed for about two minutes; however, others with a preference for stronger tea might hazard three minutes brewing. If you wish to make it even stronger, I recommend brewing it for a greater amount of time for each individual cup until you encounter the perfect combination. Also, you will note that even the tea bags smell divine and are almost irresistible themselves.<br /><br />- Ravenova

I was so dissapointed when the packaging changed and you received less popcorn for the same price AND it was in a "bowl" that had plastic on the top and bottom.  No only does the popcorn burn, but you also get possible issues with the heated plastic.  Now it appears that Orville Redenbacher is changing the name to "white popcorn" and leaving off the tender; as if this is a "new" product.  I have switched to organic popcorn.  It's not as tender, but I know that it is not genetically modified either.

These are great for smaller dogs because they're not too hard (you can easily break them in half), and they're just the right size (breaking it in half gives your doggie two little bites).<br /><br />I keep these treats on top of Pixel's crate, and she gets one at bedtime or when she has to go into her crate during the day. She loves them so much that if I tell her "time for bed," she runs to her crate and sits inside, looking up at the top of the crate because she knows that these treats are there and she's going to get one.<br /><br />Best dog treat I've found so far! I hope Amazon gets these back in stock soon. The 6-pack deal that I bought was by far the best deal I've seen on these treats.

review/summary: Half stale candy.
review/text: If you read the reviews of different sellers of this product on Amazon, you will find that many customers are complaining about the same thing. Old (possibly out of date) Flake candy with dual Arabic and English labeling. I would not purchase Fake from any seller on Amazon unless they were to state in their description that the candy was fresh. My order was not inedible, but the quality was definitely compromised.

review/summary: Arrived very promptly
review/text: I think this arrived around a week after I had ordered it. When I did, it was on sale and less than $1 per bar.<br /><br />I expected some of the bars to be broken since the chocolate in itself is crumbly and prone to breakage. The packaging it came in was a bubble wrapped box that had been obviously thrown around, but I don't fault the company Pharmacy Place for that. 1 of the flake's packaging unraveled so when I opened the box, it showered my desk with chocolate specks and bits. I then checked the flake to see if it had actually come from England and was not Arabic (seeing that many people on different flakes had gotten the Arabic version rather than an "authentic" English version), to my surprise, it did not appear to be from any place other than England, though a quick peek at the expiration date explained why it was on sale. It had expired about a month before. Shelf life isn't what it is now, so I don't really worry much about that, instead I did a taste check. The flake itself is a bit older than if you had bought it from a Sainsbury or another in England, but the taste wasn't compromised. It still had that chocolatey and tarty flavor that I had grown to love. Though, the chocolate wasn't as glossy as it should have been had you bought it from England.<br /><br />So, they get 4 stars. -1 for expired candy, -1 for slightly stale, but +1 for fast shipping.<br /><br />If you could get this for a bit under $1 per bar, then I would highly recommend it, but if you had to pay nearly $20 for just 12 flakes, I would wait until it's on sale since this isn't the best quality that you can actually get.<br /><br />But to actually get the addicting flake in the USA rather than in Europe, I would buy this again (and it's a great gift to give to your friends who haven't tried this candy yet!)

review/summary: Delicious cookies--nothing like Newtons, though!
review/text: These are delicious cookies, but I kind of wish they had left the word 'Newtons' off of the label. I like Fig Newtons, or any other fruit Newtons, but these cookies are nothing like that. I can see people either buying these, or avoiding them, because they expect them to be like Fig Newtons, and these are more like an English Tea or Lorna Doone cookie experience.<br /><br />They are lightly sweet, thin and crunchy and quite dense. They hold up well to spreads such as peanut butter without breaking. The flavor is somewhere between a homemade oatmeal cookie and some kind of upscale, deluxe granola bar. They have a richness to them; a buttery texture like finely minced pecans. The various fruits they use are finely minced, too; little tart sparkles that add to the taste. This particular cookie has chocolate and raspberry, definitely the most luxurious taste of the bunch.

review/text: Chocolate and raspberry?  My favorite combination, so when I saw this package of fruit thins, I couldn't resist!  And I'm happy I didn't.<br /><br />These cookies are great by themselves, but when paired with a really good ice cream, the combination is heavenly.  Crispy, chocolaty. with just a hint of raspberry, these are definitely worth the price (which is not inconsiderable for a 10.5 ounce pack of cookies).  Those who like gooey cookies with lots of icing may not find these high on their list of favorites, but that's ok -- more for me!<br /><br />There are more flavors yet to be tried.  Are they just as good?  Time will tell.<br /><br />Five stars!

review/text: What attracted me was the Newtons name on the package and I wondered how can they have a "new" Newtons as good as Fig Newtons? Tempting too was the introductory pricing at the supermarket. So far I have tried the chocolate-raspberry, cranberry-citris, and blueberry-brown sugar. Fig is next. Chocolate is my favourite, it is real cocoa flavor. I will say this... you can't have just two cookies! Tasty with lower calories than most packaged cookies. I came on Amazon hoping to find a well-priced package of 4, but the pricing is outrageous, one can find them much less expensive on sale at the supermarket if you can even find them. The chocolate-raspberry goes fast and least available. You won't go wrong with the other flavors though.

review/summary: Great Tea Biscuit/Scone type treat!
review/text: These remind me of the English tea biscuits that are nearly impossible to find and<br />don't have this wonderful flavor.  Yeah, real raspberries in the cookies and the chocolate<br />doesn't overwhelm the berry flavor.<br /><br />And for those wondering if they are dry... no where does the description<br />say this is a soft cookie, so you can't assume they wouldn't be what they are;<br />a thin, crunchy, cookie.<br /><br />Excellent flavor and I hope these stay around for a long time. I think these go better with coffee or a dark hot chocolate,<br />basically a stronger drink. These are excellent, just not as delicate as the Blueberry,<br />or the Cranberry/citrus which I find as tasty as the Blueberry.  The Fig is good, but I have<br />to be in the mood for them as their flavor is very unique.<br /><br />If you are looking for a Tea Biscuit these are excellent and they are great for milk dunking.<br />These were easy to find locally as well and at a much lower price.

review/summary: Huge Disappointment!
review/text: I was excited to try this flavor combination.  I opened the package in my car, and was sadly disappointed. It was dry, and had hardly any discernable raspberry flavor.  (I love the lemon, and cranberry citrus flavors.) I thought maybe my 35 year old son would eat them, but he didn't even finish the first cookie; it went into the trash.<br />  I took them to work the next day, and got 3 negative opinions, and one "okay". Most said that there was no raspberry flavor, and it was a mealy texture. (No one had a second cookie.)  I eat whole grain items all the time, and they don't have to have a mealy texture.<br />  I will try other flavors, but steer away from the Chocolate Raspberry.

So, even though this food is on the expensive side, I don't mind spending the money knowing she's getting a very good product and since I just give it to her 3 times a week, the 24 cans (3 oz) last for quite a while. We tried tuna, next time I'll try another flavor.

review/text: Preparing homemade Pan de Muerto is a time consuming affair (rewarding, but time consuming). So if you're pressed for time around this time of the year, El Molino is here to save the day. Their Pan de Muerto is only available two months out of the year, and it arrives fresh on your doorstep. Glad to see Amazon is offering it this year.<br /><br />The bread is awesomely sticky and sweet smelling, with a springy texture. If you've never had this kind of bread before, it's kind of like Panettone, only without the raisins, and with a wonderful sugary glaze on the top (although you can also find El Molino Pan de Muerto without the glaze, some places do sell it that way).<br /><br />Shipments sometimes arrive with instructions on warming it up, and sometimes don't, depending on the seller. Generally you can warm it in a 300 degree oven for ten minutes, and I highly recommend warming it before serving. It will make your kitchen smell wonderful.

review/summary: Titan Loves his ZiwiPeak Venison!
review/text: This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.  You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky.  But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is high quality.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.

review/summary: Amazing For Finicky Eaters and Stomach Issues
review/text: If you have a dog that turns his or her nose up to all dry and wet foods from premium names such as Wellness CORE, Merrick, Blue Buffalo, Evo, Stella and Chewy's Freeze Dried Patties, Dr. Harvey's etc. then you have to give this a try. My dog is a 40lb Sheltie/Collie mix so having a large highly active dog that wouldn't eat was very stressful I hear many people with toy breeds having the problem but I never thought I would happen with a high energy dog. I was shocked that she hated all other dog food and would only eat a little if I wet the dry food and hand fed her she would really try and starve herself any other way and she was not holding out for human food because I do not give her any knowing the problem would of got worse, if that was possible. I found this food by searching online for food for picky eaters and this came up. I was not hopeful because a lot of the brands I previously tried had similar reviews of picky eaters liking it and my my dog not. When I read that it was jerky like pieces it sparked an interest because she loves those types of treats. The company sent me a Venison trial bag and I purchased the Lamb 2.2lb bag and she lovesssss it. She wakes me up now at 8am whimpering by the bag because she wants it soooo much. The smell and texture is incredible I never saw her eat so fast and she is so much more energetic and happy this food is amazing and not that expensive considering the smaller portion. I could not be more happy this product has everything I need.

review/summary: One of the best dog food out there.
review/text: I have a very picky puppy that would often rather starve himself, than to eat something he doesn't like. Because of that, he was becoming underweight and I decided to switch him away from dry kibble to have him gain some weight first before worrying bout his picky taste.<br />However when I give him ziwipeak, he would finish it up right away!<br /><br />This brand is expensive, but based upon the amounts you feed, it isn't really that much expensive if you have a small dog. I have a 2 pound puppy that is expected to mature at about 4-5 pounds, and the costs is about 25cents extra a day. If you have a big dog that's gonna gobble up 1/3 of a bag or more a day, then that will be a lot more expensive for you.<br /><br />But......<br />The quality of food and the fact that it is in a jerky meat form makes it a lot better than eating hard dry kibble all day long.<br />Anyone would be bored of eating biscuits everyday for his entire life :/<br /><br />The quality of this food is unsurpassed.<br />There have been no problems at all with this food at all as well either. No recalls, all made in New Zealand as well.<br /><br />Something that I tell a lot of people.<br />Spend more on food daily, and not risk the possibility of having a sick dog due to some pet food recall. Vet bills are going to cost you a few thousand dollars.<br />Expensive dog food will probably add up to the same cost as most over the duration of your dog's life, unless you have a really big dog.<br />So instead of having to go through the grief of having a puppy in pain, and you undergoing mental and emotional stress, why not just give it a food that is good and safe and something that the dog enjoys, and spare yourself from all that unnecessary trouble?<br /><br />Yes times are hard and most people are having difficulty putting dinner on the table for themselves or their kids. So there are situations where foods like this are just too much to afford.<br />So unless if your budget really is a problem, I would recommend this food to anyone!

review/summary: Yes, it's expensive but...
review/text: SO WORTH IT.  And when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is a lot of food packed into those tiny squares.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.

review/summary: Looks gross, smells gross, my dog loves it!!!
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this because it costs a fortune and venison and fish sounded pretty unappetizing.  But I was desperate, because I have a 16 year old dog who's always been a picky eater but had now lost a dangerous amount of weight because of a heart condition.  The pet store said this was the tastiest thing they had in stock and they couldn't keep it on their shelves, so despite its $4/can price tag, I decided to try it.<br /><br />The food looks gross.  It has strange-looking pieces in it (tripe? some exotic part of the venison or blue mussel?), and it doesn't smell like something I would want to eat, either.  But my dog cannot get enough of it. She gobbles it up and begs for more.  She's gained back the weight she lost, and feeding her is no longer an excruciating, hour long process of coaxing and pleading.  Unlike some cheaper canned foods I've tried, it does not give her digestive problems.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater and you've tried everything, try Ziwipeak.  Maybe your dog just has a sophisticated palette :-)

review/summary: Great Product - Too Expensive!
review/text: I've tried raw, canned and dry.  Accept for home made, I have yet to find a healthy, processed food that my dogs love as much as this food that is also convenient for me.  It is absent the corn and wheat products that you should avoid.  It is not a totally dry food but comes in a bag and is more dry than wet.  I suggest you also store in the refrigerator.  The four rating is because it is also one of the most expensive products - so much so that I may have to keep searching for a less expensive alternative.  I am also concerned at recent reports that the concentration of too much animal protein in a dog's diet may create organ problems.  If you use this food check for portion size which is less than your usual kibble.  And don't forget to give your four legged friend a sprout of brocolli, chip of sweet potatoe and some other vegetables now and then.  Do your research as there are some foods that should not be fed to your dogs includeing cooked bones which can cause havoc for them.
