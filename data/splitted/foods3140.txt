review/summary: One of the best KIND varieties
review/text: Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow me to review the different KIND flavors individually, so I have to do them all in this review.<br /><br />I picked up a box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio and Cranberry Almond a few weeks back when Amazon was doing another one of their KIND promotions. Among the varieties of KIND bars I've tried over the last few months, the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio ones are easily my favorite in the whole line. They aren't overly sweet, and the variety of flavors in this version is excellent. While the pomegranate doesn't stand out much, the pistachio is definitely there as a nice subtle aftertaste.<br /><br />The Cranberry Almond, while still enjoyable, is a bit lower on my list - with nothing else to balance the flavors out, the cranberry flavor comes across a but too strong and tangy (though some might actually appreciate this).<br /><br />While I don't think these are meant to be more than snack/dessert bars (as opposed to meal replacements like with Clif of Powerbars), they certainly tide me over for at least an hour or two until I can eat a proper meal.

review/summary: Damp & chewy
review/text: I purchase Kind bars from my retailer every day and was trying to save a few dollars. These bars arrived in a damaged carton that appeared to have experienced excessive moisture. The bars had a weird "melted" texture and were not up to standard. I would absolutely not reorder them from this source.

review/summary: Very delicious
review/text: I was really surprise about the taste. It was very delicious. You can really taste the pomegranate, blueberry and pistachio. No kidding. I love each one of those and to be combined in one great snack, that's so KIND :) Oh! The antioxidants is a plus. The reason I only give it four star is because it is high in calories and sugar. Other than that, I definitely would buy this again and recommend it. I just ordered another flavor too.

review/summary: A Nutty Brick
review/text: Taste is a personal issue so I won't comment on that.  Just be advised that compared to the Fruit and Nut variety which, if you hold one sideways, will actually slowly fold over, these are thicker and MUCH more solid.  If you have sensitive or loose teeth or maybe dentures, be forewarned.  You should take your bites with your molars or break off a piece by hand just to make sure your chompers can handle it.  I apologize to any dentists financially harmed by this review.

review/summary: Delicious & Healthy!
review/text: I have tried a number of the Kind bars at this point because I have basically fallen in love with their line of products. It started with a Cranberry Almond one from Starbucks and since then, I have started buying several boxes every month. I don't like dark chocolate very much but thought I would give the Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate bar a try this time around.  I'm glad I did! Delicious and not at all bitter like I expected. It will be the perfect late afternoon snack for those days that I am craving sugar and/or chocolate at work.  Overall though, I like the Cranberry Almond the best and repeatedly go back to it as a staple for those times I skipped breakfast, need a snack, I'm on the road, etc. The Madagascar Vanilla is very good as is the Pomegranate Blueberry. Not so thrilled with the Mango and Apricot versions.  I've shopped around locally and online and Amazon seems to be the best place to buy them in terms of price, especially if you put them on Subscription. Kind's line of Grains is also good... The Maple Walnut is perfect heated in the microwave like oatmeal.  Strong excellent flavor and loaded with healthy grains, nuts, etc. Overall, I have been very pleased with Kind and will continue to buy their products as long as they remain available.

review/summary: KIND PLUS Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew Bars
review/text: This review is for the DARK CHOCOLATE CHERRY CASHEW flavor only....these are so good that I had to quit buying them so often because I would eat the whole box in 2 days! These are as good as candy bars. They DO NOT taste like any sort of "healthy" snack bar or anything. Now, some of the other flavors do and I think some of them are gross but this flavor is like eating a dang Chunky candy bar or something. Seriously, they are so good. They are really crumbly though so don't eat them in your jammies watching TV late at night (guilty!) or you will wake up covered in chocolate. :) But if you like nutty chocolate bars you will love these and you won't feel as guilty as if you were eating chocolate candy...but you won't be able to tell that you aren't!

review/text: I have tried almost all of the Kind bars.  They are all very delicious<br />and filling.  They are low in sodium and a lot the fat they contain<br />is the good kind (from nuts).  My husband is not crazy about nuts in<br />food but loves this Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew,which I think is much<br />better to satisfy his sweet tooth than a candy bar. Hope Amazon continues<br />to sell them because I can not find them in the store.

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: The flavor of these is definitely what stands out immediately to me. Most healthy snack bars have either an unappetizing or bland flavor. The flavor of these is bold and the textures are great. The chewiness of the cranberries mixed with the crunchiness of the whole nuts makes for a great combination. They also are healthy for you and pretty filling. Great snack to give you energy for exercising while also helping you keep your food intake down.

review/summary: Balanced, satisfying, and not too sweet!
review/text: These bars are great if you are sensitive to sugar. I have a hard time eating things that are hight in carbs with very little fat or protein. These bars are very well balance for an energy bar and I've never had a problem eating them. They taste very fresh and not as processed as most bars. They seem to be made of whole ingredients that you can see in each bite. They aren't too sweet and won't make your blood sugar hit the roof only to crash shortly after. They provide steady hunger relief. The flavors are wonderful. I love the peanut butter chocolate and the dark chocolate cherry cashew.

review/summary: New and NOT Improved
review/text: I saw people here complaining that the formula changed, but it seemed the same to me. Then recently I bought one that tasted awful. I figured it was me - maybe I had a cold coming on or something changed my taste buds for the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the good news is I can now find them at airports and everywhere. The bad news is that I've thrown away most of them half eaten as they almost taste "off" like they've gone bad. Very disappointed - I used to travel with 5 or 6 of these in my suitcase at all times. Hopefully they do something to revive their previous quality. Sometimes growth is painful.<br /><br />Someone post a review if they get better - until then I'm not buying any overly expensive and inedible bars. :(

review/summary: Break out the Beano/Peanut Bar w/Protein Powder Aftertaste
review/text: On the plus side they do fill you up & are packed with protein, filling & gluten free. On the downside - unless your idea of tasty is protein powder, I'd choose a handful of nuts versus this bar. Also you may want to consider Beano before eating these bars!!!<br /><br />LOVE the Almond Coconut KIND bars. Love the dark chocolate peanut butter ones, though more peanut than actual peanut butter. Taste somewhat similar to a healthy Baby Ruth. These Macadamia, Almond, Walnut bars have an initial odd protein powder aftertaste (though I don't think there's any in them). Once you keep eating it the initial taste goes away. I question why they would incorporate an odd taste when full of nuts that are protein packed. What's been added to make my tastebuds cringe at the unsavory taste? Peanut flavor outweighs the any flavor of other nuts once past the Protein Powder flavor. Barely a hint of macadamia nut flavor exists, though a promise of macadamia is what swayed me to order. All in all - would have been fantastic if able to elmininate the offputting protein powder taste. Wanted a tasty replacement for unhealthier counterparts. Unfortunately these failed to do the trick for me.<br /><br />A fan of the Almond & Coconut ones cause those have a great taste. These are off my list of future items to order.

review/text: I heard about this bars on QVC thought I could get a better price on Amazon & I did.  These taste so good, I like that they are all natural, they are so chewy.  While I was eating one,they were so fresh that they started bending in my hand.  I gave them to some of my co-workers to taste & they already want to order some.  Wouldn't hesitate to buy if you like a chewy, great tasting bar if you want something less chewy try the blueberry, pomagranite pistachio.  I'll be ordering more

review/summary: All natural and all fun!
review/text: Kind bars are not only all natural but gluten free as well! They are a great tasting snack (can be a meal replacement), that are filling and available in a variety of flavors. And yes - these are made in the US of A. So, you don't have to worry about contamination.<br /><br />I have a personal preference against peanuts and unfortunately that limits your selection but there are still quite a few options. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is my favorite since it not only is all healthy nuts (no peanuts!) but also includes a vegetarian source of Omega 3 - flax seeds.<br /><br />Our four year old loves these bars as well and that makes these truly special (as part of what I can assure you is a very small list of healthy foods!) Amazon's price on these is the best!

review/text: I love the Kind Almond coconut bars so I decided to try the peanut butter dark chocolate.  It arrived in a box of 12 and all appear fresh.  The bars are both gooey and crunchy.  It is tastey but not as good as the almond coconut.  Very peanutty with a little but of nice dark chocolate.  I like that it is higher protein and that I get to feel like a I had a candy bar but without the crash of eating way too much sugar.  This bar is good but not my favorite

review/summary: The best KIND bars!
review/text: This is far and away my favorite of the KIND bars. They aren't sticky like some of them, and they don't just seem like another combination of almonds and fruit, like many of them seem to be. The peanut butter taste makes these really different from the others, and the drizzled dark chocolate is such a great addition. These are prone to becoming melty, though, so I keep them in my desk instead of a backpack or pocket. These are also hard to find in stores around me, so being able to get a box at a time is nice.

You can actually recognize what you are eating.  There are whole macadamia nuts in the bar.  They really do not taste like any other gluten-free bars that I have tried.  The KIND bars are so much better!  My absolute favorite is the Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew!  I buy several of those every time that I go to Kroger or Whole Foods.

review/summary: Dark Choc is the dominant flavor; lots of crunch and chewiness
review/text: While the bar does contain a lot of peanuts, the peanuts are not the dominant flavor and neither are the cherries. Each ingredient is noticeable, but in the same way that one instrument is noticeable in an orchestra--they all play well together. What I like most about this bar is the dark chocolate and the texture. The bar is satisfyingly chewy with crunch from the peanuts and macadamia nuts, etc.  I was leery of this bar because I don't like chocolate covered cherries and thought it might have that flavor, but the cherry isn't overpowering and the bar isn't sickeningly sweet. It comes across like a somewhat healthy but flavor-rich treat for adults, not a bland granola bar or a kid's candy bar. Just ordered more on subscription.

review/summary: Not as good as they used to be
review/text: Agree with previous reviewer -- these used to be fantastic, now just OK. Still my favorite energy bar, but as with others they have added cheap peanuts to most of the flavors. For those of us with peanut allergies, that's a real problem. I used to be able to eat most of the flavors, now there are just a few without peanuts. Last few months bars taste much more cardboardy than before -- they used to taste like fresh nuts & dried fruit.

review/text: I was looking for a low carb bar that tasted good and had a higher protein content. This KIND bar was perfect with 10g protein/bar and only 15g of carbs and it tastes absolutely delicious! I like the fact that it has a lot of nuts (which their good fats) which helps it break down slower and more evenly so that you don't get hungry as quick and your body gets to absorb the nutrients more evenly. I bought the high protein KIND bard with the dark chocolate as well but this Almond Walnut Macadamia one tastes better. I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Good for you, tasty, but gooey
review/text: I really like these KIND bars. They're tasty, they're light, and they're good for you.<br /><br />The bars I'm reviewing are Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio. They really don't taste like any of those, they taste like an almond bar with various bits of indistinguishable fruit bits. Here are the ingredients, with the titled ingredients in all caps: Almonds, blueberry pieces (BLUEBERRY, apple, and plum puree), raw sugar, glycerol, citrus fiber, cashews, honey, raisins, glucose, POMEGRANATE, crisp rice, chicory fiber, PISTACHIOS, soy lecithin, natural flavors. The ingredients are always listed in descending order of how much is included, and KIND pulled a fast one by calling their "blueberry pieces" a separate ingredient, since it's really just apple puree. By my math guesstimate, there is less than 5% of Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio in the whole bar.<br /><br />Basically, this tasted like an almond bar. My advice is to read the ingredients, and expect it to taste like what's in the ingredients, and not go by what the title is on these bars.<br /><br />They're also really gooey. These are probably the stickiest bars I've ever had. I never pick them up with my hands, but I eat them out of the plastic.<br /><br />Also, I've ordered about ten of these boxes off of Amazon, and one box was rock hard. Not this one, but another kind. So if your box is hard as a rock, then just order another one, and odds are it will be okay.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Good for you<br />+Lots of natural ingredients<br />+One bar is a good snack (not too sweet, not too small, just right)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The ingredients on the title of the bar misrepresent the actual ingredients<br />-Very gooey and sticky. You won't be able to touch them with your hands<br />-From my experience, 10% of the boxes have bars that are hard as rocks

review/summary: Good but maybe my package was old.
review/text: I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.

review/summary: Taste great, but way overpriced for the size and ingredients.
review/text: I must admit I like them, and they are a healthy alternative to a candy bar.  But at about $1.50 each for a very small light bar, they're too expensive for most.  Honey, nuts, and a few pieces of dried fruit shouldn't cost that much.  A competitor may come along hopefully with a better value.

review/text: I do like the taste of these bars, however, do plan to get sticky when eating.  These stick to the plastic pouch and are difficult to get out, especially if you eat them while bike riding, running or working out.  You end up with a mess on your hands.  Refrigerating before eating may help, but may also lead to tooth loss.  These are my thoughts!

review/summary: Reminds me of Christmas time when I was a girl. . .
review/text: I couldn't believe my luck. This little nut bar was included in my variety pack of these yummy Kind bars that I had ordered from Amazon last month. The taste and texture of this nut bar is the exact same taste as the beloved "no bake fruit cake" that my Nana made us when I was a little girl back in the 50s and 60s. It must be the dates and the particular kind of nuts because it tickles my taste buds in just such a way as to send me back years ago. I thank you Kind bar makers as being genius in your combinations of ingredients. I love these things... Love, love, love. I have just recently made an order with Amazon for a box of 12 of these things... and just when I remembered a book I wanted and decided to add that to my order... gosh, well, I goofed up and I hope that Amazon figures it out for me just in time because if I get all 24 of these nut bars I am in real trouble. I will eat them till they're gone. So, please, cross my fingers Amazon does their usual magic and gets my order just right! I have been invited to "Like" them on my Facebook page, but then I don't go there often and... well, if I tell everyone, then they may become hard to find in the future... sorta like telling everyone where your favorite fishing hole is and then not being able to go there because it's so crowded.<br /><br />Computers are so picky!  I offered to write a review of a different flavor of this Kind bar and it told me that only one review per product per customer... but I could edit my review! So, here I am. Back again to further praise and describe what has become my favorite snack food. They are so filling though, you have to watch it because it becomes a meal substitute and then your friends think you're no fun cause you won't eat with them! You're already full! The protein in these bars make them ideal for trail food, however, if you don't have the teeth for nuts, stay away. This last bar I decided I'd praise is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNANSO">KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>. I found them in my local grocery store but they often run out and that's what sent me to Amazon for a check on their availability. Yum! Lucky me! So, I'm out. I ate all I ordered last month and I'm daydreaming of them right now. Should've ordered them a week ago so I wouldn't be out now. These dark chocolate bars are so delicious I can conjure up the taste and sensation right now because. . . now here's the heaven part of this daydream. . .they taste like Baby Ruth candy bars from when I would a youth!  Yum, yum, yum.<br /><br />Gotta love it, guilt free candy! But, wait, everyone, it is NOT guilt free if you make it an extra snack, but instead make it part of your meal planning day. The nutrition and calorie info is printed on each bar and if you buy them in the carton, then the info is even easier to read.

review/summary: COMMON GARDENIA PROBLEMS and their solutions
review/text: I've bought three Bonsais from BRUSSELS BONSAI in the last week, and I have to tell you, i'm impressed by the service, and the quality of their trees. I've had about a half decade experience with bonsai, and considering that an old bonsai is anywhere from 75-150 years old, I'm STILL a neophyle. However, a neophyle in Bonsai can still have lots of experience with gardening, and I have that. The first thing I'd say to those who hesitate to purchase a Gardenia after reading the bad reviews here, is I seriously doubt that ANY problem you read about is from the plant, but rather the plant's caregivers. GARDENIA IS NOT A FIRST ATTEMPT BONSAI. If you want an easy plant, get a Chinese Elm, or a juniper. However, lets say you have a Gardenia, and you dont want to commit bonsai hari-kari, then here are some suggestions.<br /><br />1. These are tropical plants, zone 8-11, and don't thrive below 50-59 degrees. Everything i've read says to protect from drafts, give them LOTS of light (Southern Exposure), using a grow light, or florescent light in the dead of winter if nessacary. If you have it on a windowsill, you might turn it around, so the back faces front from time to time. MAKE SURE IT DOESNT GET TOO HOT OR COLD.<br /><br />2. As tropical plant, THESE PLANTS REQUIRE HUMIDITY. More humidity than you will get with a humidity tray placed under your pot. I've sat a tray of water next to the plant as well. This is obviously a big problem in winter in the north, where dry houses are common fron central heating. PLANTS WONT FLOWER WITHOUT PROPER HUMIDITY. (or the flower buds drop off, right before flowering.)<br /><br />3.DO NOT MIST. The people who complain of yellow spots on their leaves, got those spots from either allowing water to sit on the leaves, or from misting the plants. Misting also leads to leaf rot. Obviously these are VERY TEMPERMENTAL PLANTS. You need to provide enough water, too little or too much, and your leaves will drop off. Water less during the winter, and keep well watered in the growing season, and hot, sunny weather.<br /><br />4. FERTILIZE the plant with an azalea plant food (ACIDIC/high nitrogen). Do this in the spring, dropping to a low nitrogen food in the summer. I've read that the plants enjoy getting fed thru their leaves once, during the spring.<br /><br />5. INSECTICIDES. The gardenia gets scale insects that suck the sap, also white flies and aphids. You can pick off the bugs if just a few. I've seen people use flypaper to grab gnat like pests, tho a weak insecticide if you have too many bugs to pick off by hand. Gardenias can also get mildew, from the high humidity, which will require removing the infected leaves, and even using a fungicide if nessacary.<br /><br />6. PRUNE this bonsai only if it's lost all shape, and then after flowering, careful not to remove next season's buds. Stems with 6-7 leaves, can be trimmed by hand back to 3 leaves. Repot them in early spring, making sure the soil has NO LIME (acidic soil lover), and is free draining and fertile.  Personally, I think you can get away waiting til the plant is completely pot bound.<br /><br />TAKE NOTICE! These plants need a fairly constant tempurature, tho some writers say they can require cooler nigthtime tempuratures. These plants are so tempermental, that even moving them around, can cause them to have problems. Its no joke that plants appreciate prayer and gentle talk, tho that might be because you are close to them, breathing CO2 on the plant, which they breathe in.  It's not a bad idea to research these plants on line, where you'll find lots of websites filled with gardenia suggestions, youtube videos, and helpful hints. GOOD LUCK BONSAI LOVERS!

review/text: Root beer barrels on steroids.  These are a sweet and delicious treat.  This flavoring is for those of us who like a kick--there is a lovely herbaceous taste to these barrels that lingers until the barrels are disintegrated in your mouth.  I tasted several herbs and spices, and even tried to read what they are made of (a guarded secret I guess).  For sure there is lots of vanilla and maybe some sassafras,  nutmeg or allspice and maybe cloves.  I am just guessing in order to give the idea of strong flavor treat these barrel will give you.  They are larger than other barrels and delightfully long lasting.  The wrapping is strong and protective, but easy to tear open.  There is not one barrel left.

Many commented that were it not for the color they would have thought they were real coins at first glance.  The chocolate was good quality also, good flavor.

review/summary: Was very disappointed
review/text: We were really looking forward to these chocolate coins - especially after reading the reviews, but I must say that while very pretty, the chocolate itself was almost greasy in texture. We're very familiar with high quality European chocolate, and this - to our family - did not fill the bill at all. I would not buy it again.

review/summary: Powdered Wheat Grass vs Fresh Wheat Grass
review/text: As most of you probably are, I was a bit skeptical while placing my order for this Wheat Grass Powder. Instant wheat grass sounds both unappetizing and not especially nutritional. Well, as is my nature, I did needless amounts of research on the effectiveness of powdered wheat grass, and found several articles with very mixed answers, so I decided to give it a shot and decide for myself.<br /><br />My first impression was that this stuff was disgusting. While fresh wheat grass bought at a health store smells like a freshly cut golf course, this stuff smells like a barn. I held my breath and mixed the recommended amount of the dark green powder with a glass of ice water and chugged. I couldn't get 1/4 way through with the mixture before I gagged and decided I would never drink the stuff with water again. The label recommends drinking it with a juice, particularly orange juice, so that's what I did the second time around. If you mix it with a strong enough flavored juice, it is actually quite enjoyable. The nasty taste is barely detectable, and all you are left to put up with is the smell. Currently my favorite juices to mix it with are stronger flavored juices mixed with multiple types of fruits - anything with grapefruit juice works great. On to the effects.<br /><br />When I down a shot of fresh wheat grass, I get a small boost of energy - but most importantly I maintain a healthy up-beat feeling throughout the day. The result is more of a lack of fatigue than an elevation in energy. With this powdered wheat grass, I get the same effect, simply on a lesser scale. The initial boost of energy is barely noticeable, but I am able to maintain that same "healthy feeling" that I get with the fresh wheat grass. And the nutritional value is all there: both the vitamins and chlorophyll (see table below). The final test, which I plan on conducting: The Hangover Test. A shot of wheat grass will get me out of that half-asleep feeling I get after a night of heavy South Florida binge drinking, so it is only natural that I test the effects of the powdered wheat grass on a hangover. While I am tempted to drink solely for the sake of this review, for now I must wait - I will update with results asap.<br /><br />Nutritional comparison of generic wheat grass powder to fresh wheat grass. (Please note that these numbers are not the same as the Amazing Grass brand, nor are they the values for an equivalent serving size as the values listed by Amazing Grass.)<br /><br />----------------Powdered--------Wheatgrass Juice<br />Protein ----------850mg--------------550mg------<br />Chlorophyll--------18mg---------------8mg-------<br />Vitamin A----------1670 IU-----------120 IU------<br />Vitamin C----------8mg----------------1mg-------<br />Iron-------------870mcg--------------660mcg-----<br />Calcium-----------15mg----------------7mg-------<br />Potassium---------137mg--------------42mg------<br />Sugars-----------&lt; 1%-----------------> 2%-----<br />Folic Acid--------21mcg---------------8mcg------<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I'm sad to report that this does absolutely nothing for my hangover.. but that's cool, it's not magic. Still deserves 5 stars.

Not only does it give me loads of energy in the mornings it also has helped me stay a "regular" guy in the bathroom. Also! For any of you folks that are drinkers this stuff is AMAZING for detoxifying. Take this hungover and you'll feel like a million bucks in a half an hour. Taste isn't amazing but then again I just drink it straight with water. Would highly recommend this product for anyone looking to live a healthier lifestyle.

However, I feel that it's more like 40 servings. I used the scoop it provided inside, but I used up the whole bottle in slightly more than a month.<br /><br />Still cheaper than buying fro Whole Foods though. I recommend subscribing it, especially if you intend to become a long-term user of this product.

review/summary: Wheatgrass satisfies my veggie cravings and hydrates...
review/text: I'm not a health nut per se, nor am I a vegetarian. I eat all foods, more healthily than your average American perhaps and prefer organic, but I'll nab a chicken sandwich from McD's in a pinch. But I do run a lot, and fitness buffs might share an experience I get pretty regularly: cravings for vegetables! When you put your body through physical stresses, I think it does a pretty good job of telling you what you need. So veggies really satisfy that craving, both for sustenance and feeling that I'm putting good nutrients in that my body is asking for. And this is where wheatgrass juice fades in...<br /><br />Through a little bird advertisement message or Amazon stumbling, I heard of wheatgrass and decided to investigate. My research pointed towards nutrient info, substantiated and unsubstantiated claims that sum to this: it's at least a healthy serving of veggies, plus maybe some protein, etc. I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I'm now happy to report that wheatgrass is an amazingly refreshing alternative to crunching on or preparing veggies, choking down protein shakes after a run, or satisfying a general craving for something healthy to ingest pretty quickly. I drink usually two scoops at a time, shook up in a blender bottle, or one scoop if it's in the morning before work. After work or a run (H20 plus veggies? gold!), I can enjoy it a bit more, with the two full scoops, 2/3s a bottle full and fully shook up. Letting it sit a few minutes and slowly drinking it allows the powder to dissolve more quickly. If you're two quick, you're likely to get some green blobs in your teeth. But it's not bad, nothing like some stomach turning protein shakes (I am probably burned out on them).<br /><br />And hey, I might live longer, might stay younger, might heal strange diseases. None of that is bad, so who cares if it's not totally true! The only negative I've heard of is from an office mate, who appeared to relay second hand information about the fiber making you 'super-regular', if that makes sense. I'm plenty regular as it is though, and haven't noticed any change in that for better or worse.<br /><br />So take it for what it is, and enjoy some healthy wheatgrass! In case anyone cares, I don't sell the stuff or partake in the health food industry at all...I just buy the stuff! Enjoy!

review/summary: Still Loving My GRAY hair!
review/text: After seeing the high rating this product received, I googled "wheatgrass" and saw various claims related to such benefits as improvement in digestion, increased energy, both anti-cancer and anti-aging properties, etc. One of the googled anti-aging claims is that wheatgrass will return gray hair (most likely hair that grayed prematurely) to its orignal color. Having grayed prematurely myself, I ordered this product even though I've not seen any such claims pertaining to this particular product besides what's on its label.<br /><br />Almost 6 months later, I have noticed no changes in my energy level, I still need an apple a day to keep the digestion flowing smoothly and my lovely gray hair is still lovely and gray. On some days, I say to myself, "Ah! I think it's a little darker than usual..." but, I can't be sure. I may just keep trying it because I feel good about consuming something in the vegetable category. And, if my hair turns back to its natural color, that's a reason to report back.<br /><br />Oh! I use a little $10 hand-mixer I purchased from Amazon to mix it with V-8 juices and/or carrot juices.

review/text: I haven;t tried other companies versions of wheat grass powder but this seems top notch.  It may be less expensive to grow on your own but you have to buy a grinder, and invest time into grinding time you want to take a shot.<br /><br />I mix this in my morning smoothie with bananas, blueberries, strawberries, spirulina powder, coconut oil, and protein powder.  It makes a pretty good smoothie I'd say.  When I first started I could feel the big energy boost throughout the day.  Now that I'm more accustomed to it I don't feel as much of the boost, but it feels good knowing I'm getting complete nutrition.

review/summary: If you've never had wheat grass...
review/text: I'll start by saying that if you already like the taste of wheat grass, you will probably like this product.  It mixes well and scoops out smoothly (no clumps).  Purchasing this product will taste just the same as you would get from a health foods shop.  Another positive point is that I am allergic to mold and did not have any reaction to this product.  (Sometimes cultivated wheat grass gets mold.  Not the case with this product.  I'm wondering if that may only be a concern of the fresh, recently grown/picked stuff.)<br /><br />I'll continue by saying that this was the second time I tried wheat grass.  I wasn't exactly fond of it before, and I still am not a huge fan.  It has a very earthy and strong flavor.  Even when you mix it into drinks, you still taste the wheat grass.  I highly suggest trying it first at a health foods shop before buying it online.  I plan on finishing this container (mostly because I am stubborn and don't want to waste a good product).  I've found that it is best to mix it (in small quantities) into drinks or smoothies that already have a strong flavor.  If you mix one part wheat grass and 2-3 parts your other drink, the wheat grass taste is muted a little (not completely) and it's tolerable to drink.  I do this every so often and it feels nice to know that I'm doing something good for my body.  (Next time, though, I'll just eat spinach!)

review/text: I was buying a pre-mixed product with similar ingredients, but it was pretty costly.<br />This is a great alternative. Takes more time, since you have to measure and mix yourself, but it is also<br />less than half the cost. I have mixed it with grapefruit juice, cranberry juice, orange juice and tomato juice.<br />Don't mix with tomato juice - it's too thick - like swallowing wallpaper paste.<br />OJ works and tastes the best with this powder. Works best in a shaker, since stirring it seems to take forever to break down the clumps that form. Overall, I'm going to continue to use it. Sign up for the subscription, to save even more.

review/summary: Still prefer fresh over packaged
review/text: I am a wheat grass advocate, but my "habit" was getting a bit expensive. I decided to save myself some money and time by buying this product.<br />Taste - eh; I would rather drink the fresh stuff they clip and send through a juicer than this. I mainly drink it just mixed with water. It is a bit chalky, but it is bearable. I really like it mixed with OJ (lessens the taste), but I don't like to drink that many calories so I pull through with the water. My suggestion: mix with a juice if you don't like a chalky, grassy taste (and who does?).<br />Ease of use - good; super simple. Get some water or juice, add a scoop, shake and drink. It is almost dummy proof (I say almost because people never cease to amaze me).<br />Value - good; this is sooooo much cheaper than the real stuff. To stop daily and get a double shot of real wheat grass is almost $4 near me (almost $120 a month). I'd rather spend the $30-some odd twice a month than $120/month.<br />Convenience - great; the great thing about this is you don't have to drive anywhere to get it. When I wake up, I can walk into my kitchen and have a glass of wheat grass. I don't have to get dressed to drive 3 miles to get the real stuff juiced. When I'm rushed, it's not a big deal. I take the canister with me to work and drink it at my desk.<br /><br />Overall, I gave this product 4 stars. I would have given 5 if it tasted better. If you would like to start incorporating wheat grass into your life, this is a pretty good way to do it. I'm 85% positive I'll buy this again.. The other 15% is considering starting to grow my own wheat grass (but that is a HUGE investment in seeds and a juicer).

review/text: Provider shipped the items to me superfast - thanks! The only downside to this size of the wheatgrass powder is that you should have the small container (from a previous purchase) to use for practical purposes ... otherwise you'll never get your hand down into the container to scoop out what you need.  But for buying in bulk there's no better method I've found.  I've been using the powder for 18 months now and it's so much more convenient than growing wheatgrass, and my naturopath says nothing is lost from having the powder instead of fresh.

It makes you regular, reduces acidity in the body (good for people with gout), improves energy levels and clears up the skin. The best description I can give is that it is a full body cleanser. It has a "grassy" taste, but is palatable if you are a green tea drinker. I have introduced it to my friends and each one of them has said that it has been nothing but beneficial. I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: great taste!
review/text: after reading the reviews i was a bit concerned about the taste. took a chance due to the health benefits. when i got it i mixed a scoop w/a cup of ziegler's apple cider inside a water bottle & shook it like crazy. it was TASTY!! to me it had an unexpectedly chocalatey-like flavor! it's a bit grainy but that didn't bother me at all (luckily). i drink it for breakfast and have substituted it for dinner if i had a large lunch along with maybe a fruit. it seems to be filling and feels good in my body. love it!<br /><br />looking forward to the weight loss i know i will get. this is MUCH better than those diet meals in a bottle. thanks, Amazon. your price is the best anywhere i've seen!

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: It took me weeks to get used to this flavor.  And at this point, I'm not even certain I'm receiving any "benefits" that others have described (more energy, etc).  I will more than likely not buy this product again.

review/summary: Good for you....
review/text: Tastes horrible;  very grainy;  makes your mouth green, but its very good for you.<br /><br />After taking it for a few weeks I notice a difference from drinking this.  Even on days that I get like 4, 5 hours of sleep I still pretty energetic throughout the day.<br /><br />Overall energy level for me has gone up.<br /><br />However, this could all be a placebo too; if it is, then that is fine too.  These don't cost too much, and is giving me lots of vitamins and minerals which I probably need.

review/summary: my dogs love it
review/text: When I drink this, I add other powders to it (acai, young barley grass, and kale) so I'm not able to give a review of how good this single item has been for my health, as it's mixed in with everything else.<br /><br />However I know that people also use these supplements for their pets, so let me address that aspect.<br /><br />Eleven of my 12 dogs love this stuff.  They sort of enjoy powdered kale (different brand than this) and will put up with powdered young barley grass if they are hungry enough (but don't really enjoy the taste), but this stuff they all think is great.  (The 12th dog will only eat it if she's REALLY hungry but otherwise doesn't care for the smell.)<br /><br />They also absolutely LOVE the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038B39E2">Amazing Grass Amazing Meal Powder, Organic Pomegranate Mango Infusion, Gluten Free, 15.5-Ounce Canister</a> made by the same company.  That one makes their breath smell wonderful, even if you have stinky-breath dogs.<br /><br />Incidentally, this supplement doesn't leave a lingering green tinge to their fur, as other grass powders do.  (When I add other supplements to their food, the vet sometimes asks me why the dog's snout is discolored. Not so with this brand.)<br /><br />The Amazon price is the best I've found, and the "subscribe and save" price makes it even better.

review/summary: All hail the wheagrass!!
review/text: This product is amazing. I initially bought the smallest canister to see how I would like it and I was immediately hooked! Not only does it give you gradual energy that is sustained throughout the day but it detoxifies your body. I remain very regular on it and see vast changes in my mood and energy level. I am unsure if it's helped my hair, skin and nails but they seem to be looking great so I would tend to think the juice is the cause.  It doesn't taste the best but can be masked with any type of juice. My boss makes an entire meal out of it but in the mornings I don't have time to chop up and blend fruits so I just mix it in some juice, chug and I'm on my way.<br /><br />This green powder is a must have!!

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: I began using this item after doing some research on the benefits.  I have to say, I love it!!  I have more energy during my day, no more cravings in midday and I lost 5 lbs in the first month!  You do have to acquire a taste for it but in orange juice, it's very good!!!  Love it!!

review/summary: Amazing, save the taste.
review/text: I decided to jump on the wheatgrass train to see what the fuss was about.  I've noticed clearer skin and a boost of energy every day when I take this.  The only downside is the taste.  I would mix this with orange juice and it would go down easier.  After getting low in my supply, I have just bought the wheatgrass pills.  I can pop a pill easier than choking down this stuff (and I don't have to run out every week to get more OJ!).  Yes the taste is a little gritty and sometimes it doesn't mix well.  When I add it to my smoothies and I don't taste it so that's an option, but I don't make a smoothie every day.  I will be buying the tablets from now on.  Great product otherwise, just the taste I can't really get past.

review/summary: I'm digging it
review/text: My brother loves Wheat Grass, the fresh stuff, and I have tried it. I mix a scoop of this with my protein shake and drink it down. Don't even taste it! My guess, probably a good thing because it doesn't smell the best. However, I do feel better in the mornings I use than the ones I don't, more awake anyways.

review/summary: Quick and easy
review/text: Having this product available in the freezer at all times is great for a fast pick-me-up.  I have 1 scoop every morning in water (with other powders) and give about half a scoop to one dog who loves it too.  Someday I hope to make my own but for now this is the best!  Plus I have it delivered automatically every 2 months.

review/text: It is my first time trying out Amaing grass.  It has a great taste but the texture could be finer.  Overall, it is a value for money product.
