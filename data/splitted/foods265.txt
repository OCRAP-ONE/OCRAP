review/summary: Sweet clean taste, very pretty flower
review/text: My 12-year old daughter and I have just found tea flowers, and wanted to try a tea that wasn't heavy with black tea leaves.  This tea is very refreshing and lovely tasting.  The strawberry flavor is truly delicious without being overpowering.  We did use some honey to sweeten it a bit, but the second cup I drank was unsweetened, and it was nice too.  The flower opened up nicely and was attractive, which is important when you buy tea flowers, as the visual is part of the ceremony.  I would buy this tea flower again, and will.  I recommend this as an afternoon tea with cookies or a morning tea with a light breakfast.  It won't be strong enough to stand against a heavy meal. It is also good as just a tea without a side at all.

review/summary: Premium Gum - Good For Your Teeth
review/text: This is the best valued Orbit chewing gum package.  You will not get tired of the flavor since you get to sample a number of them :<br /><br />3 wintermints<br />3 peppermints<br />3 cinnamints<br />3 spearmints<br />3 bubblemints<br /><br />Like other chewing gums, I have to open two everytime. One seems like too small that I almost don't feel it in my mouth. Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price. Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle. But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out. What more, it cleans your teeth. No calorie and no sugar.<br /><br />Believe it or not, Orbit gum was launched in 1944 during the war and it was really intended for our soldiers.<br /><br />Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley, the maker of "Juicy Fruit". It was granted by the American Dental Association of a seal of approval to help improve dental health. It is 1 of the top 5 brands of gum in the United States.

review/summary: Great Gum
review/text: I really like the idea of variety packs like this as you can sample all the flavors without buying a case and also it's a great idea so you don't get tired of the same flavor. Inside the box are 3 wintermints, 3 peppermints, 3 sweetmints, 3 spearmints and 3 bubblemints. In my opinion the Orbit gum is not too tough, tastes great, when cold it's not hard as a rock and it lasts a long time. I love this pack, I can't find it locally and am happy that Amazon carries it at a great price and free shipping... I can highly recommned this gum.

Great flavor<br />2. Retains its softness<br />3. Does not promote dental caries<br />4. Long lasting flavor<br />5. Not to sticky on bubble popping<br />6. Good elasticity rebound on bitedown<br /><br />This gum holds all these qualities.  I think it is well worth your trying this product if those 6 points matter to you.  You accomplish all those 6 in one gum.  Not a common thing.

review/summary: Color Me Dadgummed
review/text: I'm tired of products that promise more than they can deliver. Advertising should tell me what to expect in the real world, not in some happytime fantasy land where money grows on chia pets and all my pants fit and supermodels frolic on the shores of the lazy Guinness river. I bought this product specifically to test the claims made in their marketing.<br /><br />Orbit commercials say that no matter how dirty you get, their gum will give you a 'clean mouth'. I couldn't think of anything dirtier than the cold slushy flowerbed outside my building. So I went outside, waggled my face around in it for a while, and popped a piece of spearmint to test it out.<br /><br />On the good side, the flavor of the gum lasted quite a long time. On the bad, so did the taste of crabgrass, wet dirt and Miracle-Gro. Also, I was pulling chunks of fertilizer out of my teeth for the rest of the day. Not exactly the 'winter green' I was hoping for.<br /><br />In short, Orbit gum did nothing to provide me a 'clean mouth'. As far as I'm concerned, whoever made those commercials are a bunch of bubble-thumping smock-tucking picklejacks.<br /><br />Whoa. Maybe that gum *does* work. Fabulous.

Once in water it had no chocolate aroma and was sickeningly sweet with almost no chocolate flavor. It also had some kind of whitish particles floating on top. I guess they were supposed to be "foamy" but they looked more like partly dissolved cornstarch or something. I won't drink anymore of it and feel I wasted my money.

review/summary: USDA Organic, sulfur dioxide free dried mangoes
review/text: These dried mangoes taste similar to other dried mango products.  In some bags though, you may get an odd piece that is hard and dry -  but tasty nevertheless.<br /><br />My only problem with this product is that in each bag, some of the pieces are really tiny.  This can be annoying if I am snacking right out of the bag.<br /><br />I'll definitely re-order this product because it's free of sulfur dioxide and USDA Organic.  These dried mangoes are packaged in convenient two serving re-sealable bags.<br /><br />SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGES<br /><br />GREAT NEWS FOR THOSE ALLERGY PRONE: This product is gluten and nut free.  If you have no allergy issues and just looking for organic dried mango that's sulfur dioxide free, then I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QVO">Sunridge Farms Organic Mango Slices - these slices are much bigger! - SEE MY PHOTOS UNDER CUSTOMER IMAGES</a><br /><br />HINT:  Pop a couple bags in your refrigerator - these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0I8">Made In Nature Organic Dried Mangoes</a> taste best chilled :))<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because some of the pieces are really tiny.

review/text: These are addictive. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that I once found a brand that came in whole sections instead of the small pieces. That brand was called "Go Mango" by Hunza. Website is [...]. But you have to buy like $50 worth at a minimum. They are cheaper that way. The other problem with these ones from Amazon is that I ate them in like a week. There isn't a lot with the way I go thru them. But I like the fact that the only ingredient is mango. Really, why do you need to mess with nature?

These are a great snack with only 2 servings and 110 calories per serving per bag so you cant go too overboard. I have shared these with my coworkers, some of which dont like fresh mangoes let alone dried ones, and they loved these.

Tastes like a mango, maintaining a hint of moisture. Very seldom have I found any less than desirable bites (brown bites) which happens in other brands pretty often.<br /><br />The cons:  Small amount in the bag (price...)<br /><br />Neutral: I agree with another poster that the bites are small.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: These Made In Nature Organic Dried Mangoes are really very tasty, maybe the best I've tried so far but I was surprised to see how small these packages really are. That is entirely my own fault for not paying closer attention to the weight ~ these bags are only 3 ounces each, hardly two servings worth of dried mango per package. Considering the price, they aren't the best value in dried fruit but nevertheless they are still yummy. The pieces are quite small and rather bite-sized. The fruit is very sweet, soft and moist ~ not hard and shoe-leathery like some other dried mango products. They have been organically grown (although it states nowhere on the package that they are unsulphured like other Made In Nature fruits) and they are a product of Mexico or Ecuador.<br /><br />So I give Made In Nature Organic Dried Mangoes, 3-Ounce Bags an overall 4 stars ~ 5 stars for quality, 3 stars for value.

review/summary: Best when chilled
review/text: When I eat these along with a meal, as opposed to a between-meal snack, a 3-ounce bag contains more like 5 or 6 servings, not two.<br /><br />The package is resealable. It says to refrigerate after opening for best results. Not only does that prolong storage life, I like the taste and texture better when chilled.<br /><br />When dry, I find them pleasantly crunchy and chewy--not tough/leathery/fibrous. But a few times, I added some to a pot of simmering oatmeal, figuring they'd soften when reconstituted. Instead, they deteriorated in taste and texture. About 1/3 of the pieces became leathery and not chewable.<br /><br />Bottom line: Eat them dry and preferably chilled.

It is now one of my favorites.

review/text: I bought these for my two small dogs. A day after they had them,both acted "off" ,they refused to eat their canned dog food(Wellness).The only thing different in their daily schedule was the Petrodex Dental Chews. I read the label,it states "wash hands after handling". If there is something so toxic in these chews that I must wash my hands after handling,I sure do not want my dogs chewing and eating them.They are in the garbage.If I could have awarded zero stars,I would have.I am going to stick to the Breath Brushers made by Zuke's. Pricier,but worth it to me.

review/summary: Petrodex Dental Chews
review/text: We have a 13 year old beagle, and I noticed that he no longer chews his older toys.  I was worried about his developing dental problems in old age, so we decided to try out Petrodex dental chews.  I think these chews are a great price, and the beagle loves them! He can't wait each evening for his after dinner treat!

The dogs love the chews, especially my lab mix.  The label calls them beefhide.  They look like beefhide, but don't seem to have exactly the same consistency.  It's probably because of the other ingredients:  dextrose, poultry digest, etc. "Product of Mexico."  The "large dog" ones are about 2 1/2 or 3 by 6 inches each.

review/summary: Both my cat and I LOVE Natural Balance ... she is happy, healthy, and this food helps minimize the hairball activity!
review/text: Chances are if you are looking at Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance, you are looking into finding a quality cat food for you animals.  I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food.  Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.<br /><br />I had a long-haired cat who gifted me with hairballs on a frequent basis.  A friend told me about this food and swore by it, claiming her rugs and furniture no longer suffered from constant scrubbing.  I decided to give Natural Balance a try and was amazed at the results.  I no longer have that cat, but did inherit another long-haired cutie pie who LOVES this food.  I changed her food to this one a month ago, gradually mixing it with her previous food, and it somehow helps her body minimize the hairball activity.  I want her to be healthy and happy and find the expense to be well worth it.  This is brief blurb from their website, information that can be found on the bag as well:<br /><br />*  Fresh Chicken, Salmon Meal, New Zealand Lamb Meal This unique blend of fresh, high quality proteins provides the essential amino acids to help maintain strong muscle tone and a healthy, shiny coat.<br /><br />*  Taurine Fortified To help maintain a healthy heart and good vision.<br /><br />*  Fresh Potatoes Rich in potassium and an excellent source of highly digestible carbohydrates.<br /><br />*  Preserved Naturally To maintain freshness, Natural Balance uses only mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) in all of its formulas and will always be free of artificial flavors, colors and chemical preservatives.<br /><br />*  Skin and Coat Essential Fatty Acids are combined to produce an excellent skin and coat for your cat.<br /><br />*  High Digestibility<br /><br />No Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors, or Bleached Ingredients.<br /><br />If you need to find out more, you can check out this food at Petco, where I purchased it, or head to the Natural Balance website.  Of course everyone has their own opinion and will look at several factors when purchasing for their animals.  You and only you know your needs, but I find that this food satisfies not only mine (I don't have to invest in so many paper towels), but obviously that of my cat.  I was using a perfectly acceptable organic food, but when I mixed this with it ... well, lets just say she likes Natural better than organic.  I'm happy if she's happy and I'm not constantly cleaning up after her these days!

review/summary: Outstanding Food for both healthy and sick cats
review/text: I first switched to this food for my senior cats who both had cancer (most likely from my feeding them cheap food all their lives - never again). Within days of starting my cancer-cats on this food they both perked up, gained weight, and actually maintained the last few months of their lives in an active and normal manner. Both of course finally succumbed to cancer, but even the vet was surprised at how long they lived after diagnosis, and how brief the period of their final decline was (they both sort of bottomed out within a two day period at the end).<br /><br />Now, the other piece: I had purchased another Siamese upon learning of my other cats' illness, and he not only loved them, he also loved the Natural Balance food, which was all he got. I noticed that as he grew he was not anemic looking as most siamese are, but actually had good muscle tone. When I brought him for his first vet checkup the vet said, and I quote "In 20 years, this is the healthiest looking Siamese cat I have ever seen." She commented on his physique, muscle tone, activity level, coat, etc. I later adopted a Tabby the same age as the Siamese, and got the same response. Both cats just have sleek, beautiful coats, are very athletic and energetic, and love the Natural Balance food.<br /><br />I firmly believe that this food (and I now also use Blue Buffalo Wilderness for some variety) has made a real and noticeable differnce in the health and quality of life of my cats, and I highly recommend it to anyone. I will say my cats don't care for the wet Natural Balance foods, so I supplement their diet with an occasional Fancy Feast flavor that is free of glutens and fillers (you can Google for the list. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Addendum 4/12/10: My cats have changed their minds about the NB wet food and really enjoy it now. The key is to switch around the flavors.<br /><br />Addendum 4/22/11: have since adopted two more shelter cats, one a snowshoe siamese, the other a sable burmese. After each being on Natural Balance for about five months, the Snowshoe has a fur coat that is silky and beautiful; the little Burmese has a sleek shiny coat. Both have loads of energy. Again the vet was amazed at their coats and muscle tone, as was the vet tech.

review/text: The food is good, but I buy it because my cat really loves it. I must confess I was trying to switch her to Evo brand food, so I did the usual routine of starting to mix in the new food. We noticed that she was eating very carefully. After a few days we were up to half Natural Balance and half Evo and after she ate...very slowly...I Iooked at the bowl and realized what she was doing- she was tasting each little pellet and only eating the Natural Balance (leaving behind the little triangular Evo bits)!! We gave the rest of the bag of Evo to a friend and ordered more Natural Balance.

review/text: We have 3 cats, 2 male and 1 female.  They adjusted great on it, and their stool was quite less smelly :)  BUT after 3 weeks of use our female cat developed a urinary tract infection and the doctor said some cats can't handle the high levels of protein in some foods and higher levels of ash, magnesium, and calcium.  He told us to switch foods immediately.  So we did, the last thing you want is a cat with a uti!  If your cats are sensitive like ours seems to be this isn't the food for you!  But for bigger stronger cats it seemed ok.  Our female cat does fine with table scraps, but she is a petite cat so all the protein and minerals was too much for her.  We switched to Purina Pro Plan chicken, special urinary tract formula and they seem to be adjusting well (all 3!)

review/summary: One of the highest rated dry cat foods!
review/text: Note: I wrote this review for the 6 lb. bag (which is cheaper per pound than this bag, for some odd reason).<br /><br />I love this food. I knew the Purina One dry food I was feeding my one cat wasn't the best. After researching several different reputable websites for dry food reviews, I decided to purchase Natural Balance. Several different sites had included Natural Balance among the best dry food (especially for the money). I have been very, very happy!<br /><br />My cat switched foods effortlessly. I didn't even gradually introduce it like I should have - one day she was eating Purina One, the next Natural Balance. The one major thing I've noticed after weeks on this food? Her coat is SO much SOFTER/SHINIER! She's so silky and soft now! Holy cow! I know if it's doing such good things for her fur it's a good sign. Her bowel movements have always been nice and solid, and they look even better on this food. I also have to feed her less each day, which makes the 6 lb. bag last longer than 6 lbs. of the Purina One would have. All in all I'm a convert, and I will keep buying this food. Thanks, Natural Balance!

I have noticed a positive change in my cats' health, from the shine of their coats and clearness of their eyes to their digestion and activity levels. We live in a health-oriented household where we buy mostly organic food and drink filtered water. I want my cats to live long healthy lives and I think with Natural Balance it just may happen.

review/text: I have several cats, both inside and outside varieties.  All of them love this food. In fact, my neighbor's outside cats come to my house to eat it, the little mooches.  I have one elderly cat who seemed to be on his last legs but since I started feeding him this food, he has perked right up and seems to be experiencing a second kittenhood.  My only caveat is the price but I've been able to spend less money on canned food since I started using this dry kibble. I will continue to order it regularly but I've noticed there's quite a wait to get it from Amazon.  Guess I'll just have to plan ahead.  I highly recommend this brand.

I switched them over to Natural Balance Dry Cat Food, Ultra Premium, and both of my cats are doing much better.  No more vomiting (except for the occasional hair ball) and my eldest has formed, normal stool.  My cats aren't dying to be fed in the morning like they used to be.  I can feed them less, and they're satisfied while losing weight too.  I'm really glad I switched their food to Natural Balance.  I introduced their new food over a week-long period which causes some stomach upset from the switch, so I did a 12-hour fast and reintroduced the food, and they were both fine and have been doing great ever since.  I feed them a small amount of the dry Natural Balance as a supplement to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CFN2Y">Natural Balance Canned Cat Food, Indoor Formula, 24 x 6 Ounce Pack</a>.

review/summary: Great food
review/text: I have been feeding my 3 male cats Natural Balance dry and canned food for a few years.  I like that this dry food has chicken products as the first two ingredients, and that higher quality carbs are used (no corn or wheat).  My cats' coats seem softer and healthier, and they are as frisky and happy as ever at ages 7-8.

review/summary: My cats love it, and it's healthy.
review/text: I learned about this product from the shelter where I adopted my newest cat who is 3 years old.  They recommended it strongly, so I introduced it to my 14-year old who preferred it over Science Diet. Now I can feed both age groups the same food. I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and healthy.  It's hard to find the 15-lb bag, so I like buying this from Amazon.

review/text: This is my third re-order of this excellent product. No one sells it at a more competitive price than Amazon and the door-to-door shipping is a blessing. A handicapped friend of mine, on a very limited income, has five cats who I've helped to feed for about a year now. They've never been healthier since starting on Natural Balance and the convenience of buying it online and shipping it to her home has bridged our gap of 2,000 miles. Thank you. Great product. Great price. Great service.

review/text: I can only get this cat food at PETCO and the closest one is over an hour away. I was so relived to find it here on amazon and at a great price. Thank you amazon!<br />We chose this food because they don't dangerously test on animals like some companies (IAMS) do. Also this food does not contain any bi-products. It does contain some rice fillers but it is so hard to avoid with the budget we are on. This is the best we can afford. Our cats are very happy and healthy!

review/summary: Healthy, cat friendly food.
review/text: My cats like this food a lot.  I am happy to give it to them because it seems to be very healthy for them.  I feed them the dry Natural Balance along with the canned which they are crazy about.  With this combination their coats are shinier and even their muscle structure is tighter and they look healthier and are doing very well.  Some former foods that I used left them always hungry.  With Natural Balance they are much more content.  As far as the cost is concerned,  I actually save money.  The food lasts longer because they eat less.  I have read this is  because they need less to meet their nutritional needs.  This does seem to be the case.  I recommend Natural Balance highly.

review/text: I have had kitty on Natural Balance Chicken, Duck, and Salmon (salmon being the least favorite as far as taste) - I like to switch it up for her (who likes to eat the same crackers day in, day out?) and recently purchased the ultra formula (because she is a senior citizen at 15).<br /><br />Anyhow, her little 'gifts' to me since having her on the ultra formula have been the stinkiest little stink bombs I have ever experienced. I get up in the middle of the night thinking "she must not have buried that pile of ---," only to discover that she did fully bury that pile of ---." It just smells like ---! I'm dying whilst writing this review.  Ugggghh.

review/summary: great, but these come in a box without a liner...
review/text: great candy, just as you would get in the store, however they came shipped in a corrugated cardboard carton direct from jelly belly without a liner ( literally, the candy was just in the box with nothing else- no plastic bag, etc), which was a bit off-putting. However, I assume that if this is how I get it, this is how most retailers get it, meaning I've been eating jelly beans direct from a cardboard box my entire life. I ordered four different flavors of jelly bellies and they all came this way. No one got sick, so I assume this was sanitary.

review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!
