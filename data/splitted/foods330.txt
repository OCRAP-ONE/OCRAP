review/summary: Not bad
review/text: These pancakes don't have a lot of flavor alone.  They are also a bit of a challenge to get cooked through without burning the outside because of the chocolate content.  I end up cooking them on a medium-low burner setting for much longer than the package directions indicate to salvage them.<br /><br />Serving them with the frozen, sweetened strawberries and either some whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream, however....yummy!

review/text: This was near to perfection. I would have preferred a slightly higher cocoa content, but overall this bar was quite delicious! The raspberries, in this case freeze-dried, made the perfect compliment to the chocolate, and had an excellent mouth feel and melt. I would give it four and a half stars if it let me!

review/text: I first had these years ago so I knew that they worked great and getting them in bulk makes their value even better.  I'm not a coffee drinker, but definitely appreciate a caffeine boost.  I have one of these in the morning and it gives me energy like a soda or energy drink would, but with vitamins as well instead of the sugars and ingredients of a Monster or Redbull.  I feel the vitamins also help me stay healthier and when I do catch something it is not as severe.  Orange tastes great to me, but they also have a couple other flavors you can try as well.

By drinking an Eboost a day my immune system stays up and I can ward off everyone elses sickness.

review/summary: People are always surprised how really good this tea is -- non-caffeine & happens to be healthy to boot.
review/text: This review is for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R1UM0">Wissotzky Red Tea with Chamomile, Lime & Honey, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> There are other flavors I like very much that I refer to at the bottom of this review. These are all non-caffeine, high antioxidant herbal teas that are always startling delicious to anyone I have served them too.<br /><br />Wissotzky makes a whole range of teas, including those with black tea and those with green tea. The ones I discuss here are my personal favorites.<br /><br />Wissotzky Teas are rather renowned though, personally, I hadn't heard of them until I was teaching at my University's summer law program at University of Haifa in Israel. You pick them up at any supermarket there -- but you have to special order them over here in the US.<br /><br />Having to live in dormitory-style living while teaching over there, the tea was convenient but I was most startled by how really delicious it was. I am not a big tea drinker -- occasionally herbal tea in the winter -- but I was drinking this tea every day during the very hot Israeli summer.<br /><br />I brought quite a bit back with me and ordered more here. I often offered it to colleagues during meetings in my office and they were invariably struck by how unexpectedly delicious it is.<br /><br />So now I give boxes as gifts. And the recipients often hint they wouldn't mind another gift they so love it.<br /><br />Serving the tea at one of my group work meetings has become a hallmark tradition and puts a positive tone as we launch into a 3 hour work session.<br /><br />For more information:<br />These herbal teas are made from the Rooibus (Red Bush) plant from South Africa.<br /><br />The only authentic Rooibus tea is from South Africa -- though many companies claim theirs is Rooibus though not from South Africa.<br /><br />It is not unlike that genuine Champagne can only come from the Champagne region of France but firms market sparkling wines from other regions prepared by the "Methode Champenoise." In that case, there are excellent Methode Champenoise sparkling wines that rival genuine Champagne (though being a champagne lover -- I still find a taste unique to genuine Champagne.)<br /><br />However my experience is that non-South African Rooibus Tea is not as good nor does it have the medicinal and homeopathic qualities that genuine Rooibus tea does.<br /><br />As to the variations: Wissotzky sells the pure Rooibus Tea (which does not seem to be here on Amazon) and 3 flavored versions: 1. with Chamomile, Lime & Honey,[[B0041R1UM0 Wissotzky Red Tea with Chamomile, Lime & Honey, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (my and most people's favorite)  2. with Cinnamon & Vanilla <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R00WG">Wissotzky Red Tea with Cinnamon and Vanilla, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>(my second most favorite and many people's first choice) and 3. with Rosehip & Passion Fruit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R1DYA">Wissotzky Red Tea with Rosehip and Passion fruit, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (which I also really like and again is some people's favorites.)<br /><br />As mentioned at the start of this review -- Wissotzky makes a whole range of teas, both with and without flavors, herbal, black tea and green tea (which has its own homeopathic benefits.) I've tried many of the other herbal and enjoy them; I personally stay away from caffeine as my system doesn't handle it well.

review/text: My cat loves this food and I have purchased many other brands before this one.  She clears her plate which she didn't do with other more expensive brands.  I recommend buying the Royal Canin Discovery Pack that has three different flavors.  You put out the three flavors and watch over a few days to see which flavor your cat prefers.  Each cat craves different recipes/aromas ( according to Royal Canin) so this gives your cat the chance to pick his/her food.  I found that very helpful and I throw out less cat food now.  Give it a try!  Cats rule!!!

review/text: I first came to sherry vinegar because it is milder than the normal grocery-store plonk; I had in mind using less olive oil and therefore freighting in fewer calories. And it is good for that. But bear in mind that because it is not as acidic you might use more if you're looking for sourness, but the sherry taste is good.<br /><br />But I've found another use for it, a French technique. Finish reduction sauces with a shot of it, and it adds a great depth of flavor. If you want to blow the calories you've saved on the oil, mount the sauce at the end with butter too. Add a shot of this vinegar to stews too; a normal vinegar might be too overpowering but the sherry vinegar merely adds flavor.<br /><br />I buy it by the case.

Even though I hate paying shipping and handling charges being on fixed income we have no choice.  There is no other brand that we care for

review/text: while the taste and quality of the popcorn is fine. my big problem is that i was looking for popcorn that doesn't have trans fat. i read the entire product description and even opened the additional info labeled "nutritional facts" that is supposed to be from the product box. well you can imagine my surprise when i opened the package from amazon and read that the popcorn has 2 grams of trans fat per serving. not cool.

review/text: We just tried this for dinner last night and we enjoyed it immensely. The flavor was rich, and the texture was great. This is definitely one to keep on hand as a comfort food. It was easy to prepare and the instructions were clear. I've recently gone gluten free and am still learning what is safe to eat, so my meals have been very bland lately. Having this last night was greatly encouraging to me that my meal choices will not have to be so boring! Even my gluten tolerant daughter loved it!

review/summary: Really liked it, but there's a trick to cooking it
review/text: My sister got me a whole cajun variety gift pack from Louisiana Fish Fry on the recommendation of her friend, who's originally from New Orleans. First time cooking the red beans and rice pack, I added Louisiana hot sausage. It took a little more cooking time than the directions stated. After the suggested time, it was still too gooey, so I had to cook it down another 10 mins uncovered to allow for evaporation. But I'm thinking next time, I would add more parboiled rice to the pot from the get go. There's so much flavor and liquid, it could have easily accommodated it. Sprinkled some monterey jack cheese on top and it was GOOD. Great for what it is and an uber easy meal!

I would like to see a recommended amount (tbsps per cup of water) on the package, but trial and error is fine if you're not in a hurry.<br />(I usually add a tablespoon or so of Tabasco to enhance my homemade biscuits and gravy breakfast.)<br />A very good product that keeps forever! If you like gravy, try it and see!

review/summary: Best supplement if you must use formula
review/text: Breast milk has a plethora of advantages over formula.  Until recently, one of these advantages was that it contained DHA and ARA, fatty acids that are important components of brain structure.<br /><br />Recently, manufacturers have begun adding DHA and ARA to their infant formula.  Some studies have indicated that addition of DHA and ARA to formula provides an advantage of 6-7 IQ points over normal formula, nearly as much as the IQ point advantage of breast fed babies.<br /><br />However, the DHA and ARA added to infant formulas are chemically extracted from certain species of algae and mold using solvents, and are not identical to the DHA and ARA found in breast milk.  There have also been reports that the DHA and ARA supplemented formula causes diarrhea in some children.  In our daughter, it seemed to cause softer and messier stool, though it wasn't quite diarrhea.<br /><br />Baby's only DHA and ARA is extracted from egg yolks using a water based process, and thus may avoid some small risk associated with the solvent extracted versions.  It's mixed into formula that isn't fortified with DHA and ARA or into other foods.  We use it with Baby's Only toddler formula, and it does not cause messy stool with our daughter.<br /><br />Breast feeding is still better than any formula, of course - it has other advantages, such as a protective effect against infections that the formula makers haven't figured out yet.  However, if you must formula feed for some reason - for us, my wife's pumping at work didn't keep up with the baby's demand, and eventually we also had to stop breast feeding to try to start a second baby - mixing Baby's Only DHA and ARA supplement into a nonsupplemented formula is probably the next best thing.

It is a nice alternative to cod liver oil which can really upset a little one's stomach.  My only complaint is that when shaking milk to mix it up, it does become quite foamy and takes a while to settle.

review/text: As another reviewer mentioned, cod liver oil is extremely yucky (no matter how much they try and flavor it) and your little guy or gal will probably not be shy about letting you know.  This stuff actually tastes good.  I sometimes even mix it in to pumped breast milk for that added kick.  The only downside is the price, which is rather high per serving.

review/summary: Best Omega product for babies and kids!
review/text: I've tried many omega products for my son; this is the best so far. Since it's a powder, you can easily mix with any food that your kid loves to eat.  I mix with yogurt, applesauce and milk.  It's easily mixed and dissolved. I've been using it since my son was 6 months. The best thing is that it's not smelly at all like other omega products, so my son doesn't even notice it in his yogurt. I highly recommend this product.

It is interesting because she does not mind her Shakelee multivitamin in it and I definitely can taste the iron in that(yes, I tried it before I gave it to her). We are going to wait a couple of days and try it again. Or when she is back to eating puree again I might try to mix in.<br />I still give it 4 stars because it is a great product.

He likes it best alone but it is a good way for me to get him to drink more of his milk which has DHA in it.  The only thing I don't like about it is they don't make a big jug of it.

review/summary: Daughter enjoys drinking this
review/text: After my daughter turned one she lost interest in nursing and she refused whole milk.  I saw Gerber Yogurt juice and decided to give it a try.  The first time I gave it to my picky daughter she wasn't sure about it; but then she began to love it.  I soon began diluting a 4 oz bottle with whole milk.  Now, a 4 oz bottle will last us 2 days because I barely add any to her sippy of whole milk, just enough to give it the flavor of the juice.  I am glad that amazon sells this in bulk because we have really gone through the yogurt juice since my daughter turned one.  Now that my stock is about up in the cabinet I am going to try to give her plain whole milk.  I am glad that I found this juice to get her to drink something.

DO NOT buy Wilton if you are using them for cake pops. I didn't try them on other things, like fondant or gumpaste, but using the Wilton ones on cake pops was like writing on wax. The only thing I would suggest, would be to have a finer point tip on the Americolor pens. This would have made the lines cleaner and better looking.

review/summary: Never recieved it, company ignoring my emails
review/text: This item was a part of an order that had two other items, each from different sender. I received the first two within a few days, this one never showed up. When it was already a few days late I had an order number so I checked where it was to see why I haven't still gotten it. It was delivered. To San Diego, California. I live in SLC Utah! OK. Just a mistake, no problem. I emailed the company and they gave the shipping number to check where it is because they sent it. First of all, they gave me a wrong number, luckily I had mine saved from when I made the order. When I copy pasted the delivery to Sand Diego info and asked them what is up with that, I never got the reply back. I tried again a few days later asking do they intend to resend this item or will they give me a refung....still no replay. This is not a lot of money, but it pisses me of that I ordered something through Amazon and the company is doing this. I will most definitely never order anything from them again, and today I am contacting Amazon to see what they can do about it. it isn't the money, it's the principal!

review/text: I thought this was such a great deal until I received the package--4 partially broken bags with the flour spilling everywhere. When I cooked with it, it tasted bitter like poison, which is a sign of rancidity for millet flour. I looked at the expiration date and it was within a month. So I had to throw all the bags away.

review/summary: Remember to contact Amazon if unhappy
review/text: I just got my first "subscription" order for this item.  I set it up for every 6 months.  The items that came only had a 5-month expiration period from my order date.  I simply contacted Amazon.com to let them know I would expect to have at least a 6-month period based on my use needs and, just like that, they are trying to resolve the issue with a replacement, at no charge, and say they will refund it all if the freshness issue remains.  With the amazing cost savings with this product from them and no s/h fees with a subscription refill and the fact that they are standing behind the quality of it with no back and forth "arguing" or excuse making, I have to give a 5 star rating.  This kind of service is so hard to find anymore.  I recommend using them to get this, especially if, like me, there are no stores willing to stock it or, if they do, they charge 3-5x the price noted here.

review/text: This is nice flour, maybe a little coursely ground but tastes very good in gluten free baked goods.  The bags were not short-dated or torn but they were very beat up (maybe by the shipping - they were packed loose in a HUGE box with a few air pillows so they rattled around in the box).  The product tastes as fresh as any I have purchased at my local stores.  The price is good.  This keeps very well when stored in the freezer in a ziploc bag.

I have gotten Spelt flour from Arrowhead mills before and it was great...totally fine.  But I think with something like millet flour, that maybe not as many people use, they must just package up what they have left on the shelf.  Now I know that even though it is a little more expensive at my local health food store, it is worth it because it isn't old and expired!  YUCK!

review/summary: Millet Flour, easy order, quick delivery
review/text: My ordering the flour was quite easy. When I found out I could subscribe to it and get future orders without going through the process again I was quite satisfied. The Millet flour arrived in a couple days and I have used it. It is really great for making gluten free bread. The best I have had yet.<br />I set up my mixer, got out the recipe and in less than two hours had homemade hamburger buns and hot dog buns which have lasted me a week and are still fresh. I took them on a weeks vacation and since we ate out so many times I still had some left. They are still fresh like homemade bread. No mold at all like the other flours that taste gritty and get moldy in two days. I never would have thought to buy from Amazon.com. I had went to another web site and was linked to Amazon. Great Job.

review/summary: Good organic millet flour
review/text: It behaved as expected for millet flour. Good gluten free flour to use in breads and other recipes once you get used to the other adjustments that have to be made when baking gluten free (add more moisture and leavening agents). Over all, I think millet is one of my favorite GF flours. The flavor seems to be a lot more neutral than some of the others, and the texture is nice too. I'm a big fan of millet bread.

review/text: With a daughter allergic to glutten, I bake all the time.  Millet flour works well in baking powder breads, bisquits and pancakes.  Exchange 1/4 cup Arrowhead Millet Flour for Brown Rice Flour in a standard recipe.  You will barely know a difference.<br />This flour is a great help for those needing a little more iron in their diet.<br />Plus, corn meal bisquits seem less dry when you substitute millet flour for part of the corn meal.  It does not change the taste.  I am glad I experimented with millet flour.  I would hate to go without it now!

review/summary: Gluten free for less
review/text: If you want to be gluten free and can do your own baking and cooking with flour this is the best alternative. A very critical fact about this flour unlike most gluten free flour is that it has the same amount of protein as regular wheat flour. It is very close to the cost of wheat flour as well, currently $1.12/lb. What's amazing about that is the lowest I've found organic millet in bulk is $1.29.  Millet flour has transformed my sourdough based cooking. Working with a traditional East Indian form of sourdough culture many successful goods have resulted. This arrowhead mills flour is excellent quality, finer than I can get with my hand mill. The flavor of millet flour I personally prefer to rice flour or garbanzo flour, the other most popular alternatives. I bought my first 8 lbs in Oct 2011 and the expiration date was April 2012 which gives me plenty of time to enjoy it all and order more.

review/text: When I received this flour it was almost at its expiration date.  It already had a rancid smell.  I have bought millet flour elsewhere to ensure I received fresh flour.  For the price you pay for the flour, you would think the manufacturer would not sell old flour at full price.  I hope amazon does a little more to ensure the company is not selling old grocery items to its customers.

review/summary: Duffy's Crumpets
review/text: I discovered crumpets while on Weight Watchers, trying to find a satisfying, low cal, low fat bread and roll substitute.  Toasted, with a little "butter" (like Brummel and Brown), honey, jam or low fat cheese (I slice a round of Baby Bel lite into four thin slices) on top, makes these a delicious bread treat.  They're only 60 calories, no fat, no sugar.  This translates to 1 Weight Watchers point. (Toppings add to the points). I've tried other brands, but Duffy's is my favorite.  They're not dense or flat like some other brands.  We weren't able to find Duffy's in Arizona when we were there for 2 mos. last year.  This year I'm getting my crumpet fix via Amazon.

The plastic container with sprinkler top is perfect to keep handy with gardening supplies. While I haven't eaten it, it smells quite strong, so I think it's good stuff.

review/summary: Avoid buying these from NACM
review/text: I discovered Goya's Pink Beans at a local liquidation store.  Tried them and loved them!  I decided to check Amazon to see if they had them.<br /><br />Amazon had them listed as 4 pound bags so I snatched up all 5 bags the seller NACM had left in stock.  I was supposed to receive 5 FOUR pound bags for a total of $31.40.  NACM sent me 5 ONE pound bags instead.  I received the packages and immediately knew there was an error.  I contacted the seller straight away to tell them of the issue.  For some reason they assumed I was being dishonest and greedy???  They were defensive even though I told them Amazon has the listed as 4 pound bags.<br /><br />I sent several emails back and forth, being courteous each time, and their response was always in the context that I was trying to take advantage of them.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon customer service for the first time in over 100 transactions.  Was on chat with someone from Mumbai or India.  I was getting the run around.  "Contact the seller"......"Amazon is like a mall and the individual sellers are like small stores within that mall"......"we will not get involved unless the seller refuses to refund your money".<br /><br />At this point I thought I was stuck with beans at $6.28/pound.  I can purchase 16 pounds of these everyday for about $48.00 on another site. And less than $3.00 per 1 pound bag at a box store.  So I thought $31.40 was a pretty good deal.  The kind of deals that Amazon is known for.<br /><br />Fast forward to the next day.  I got on chat with Donovan from the US.  He researched and saw that these were incorrectly listed by Amazon as 4 pound bags and I was due compensation.  He gave me a promotional credit and I was happy.<br /><br />I contacted NACM and told them that I would NOT remove my negative feedback because of the unprofessional and accusatory way they handled the situation.  They tried to make me feel like a thief again.  I don't know any buyer who appreciates being accused of being distrustful, greedy or an out right liar.<br /><br />Here's the feedback we left each other:<br /><br />Date: August 29, 2012 Feedback 1/5:  "These were listed as 4 pound bags of beans by Amazon. I rec'd 1 pound bags instead. Paying $6.28 x 5 ($31.40) is NOT what I had in mind. NACM claim that I misread the listing and are not helpful at all. Claim filed"<br />=====================================<br />Seller Response: The beans is listed as $6.28 + free shipping for a 14oz bag, but I sent him 16oz bags. Nowhere has Amazon listed it as 4lb. Where can he get a 4lb pink beans for $6.28 plus free shipping.Customer is trying to be super greedy<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />The beans themselves are PERFECT.  The seller NACM should be avoided at all cost.<br /><br />There are 4 pound bags of these listed here on Amazon for $9.79 + shipping.  The photo listed shows a 14oz bag instead.  What I would receive if I placed another order for these in a 4 pound bag?  I'll never know because I'm getting these elsewhere next time.
