review/summary: Terrific Tea.
review/text: Lyons Gold Blend is my favorite tea because of it's rich and smooth flavor. It costs a bit more than grocery store brands, but each  tea bag easily makes three cups of tea. I've preferred the satisfying flavor of Lyons tea since Dublin friends introduced me to it many years ago. It is the preferred tea of my Irish friends, and I'm  pleased that I can purchase it in the USA.

review/summary: Incredible to the max
review/text: Oh my god... Not one, not two, but TWELVE boxes of the world's greatest cereal?! Oh yes, this is something you MUST buy. Everytime I take a bite, I think of our late great Jimmy Russels, the inventor of this fine food, and how he was not only a champion of breakfast, but a champion of life. Whenever I eat this cereal on a sad, gloomy day, I can almost hear him talking to me, "Shh, no tears, only dreams now..." This cereal is so fantastic that it is a wonderful emotional experience eating it.

review/text: Like thin strips of peanut brittle, but with toasted sesame seeds instead of peanuts, which makes it even better.  The coconut flavor is mild, but it's there, and it makes the treat that much more tasty.  At 160 calories per serving (mostly from sugar), I'm not too sure how healthy of a snack this is, but it sure is delicious!

I guess I should have listen more closely to what they had to say.  I like sesame too, so this treat is OK, but it is NOT what I really wanted.

review/summary: Not Sweet Enough
review/text: First off I want to say that these bars are NOT horrible....but I wouldn't buy them again.  First of all I love coconut AND I also love sesame bars......so it sounded like a good combination to me.  However, the seeds tasted like they were 'over toasted' and the sweetness was too mild for me. The coconut flavor was "the bomb"....but I was wishing for more sweet flavor. The almost 'schorched' taste was disappointing.  I will eat the ones I purchased but I wouldn't buy them again.

review/text: I love coconut and sesame so it's easy for me to love these high protein, natural snacks.<br /><br />They're very portable, taste great and are good for me. They have a high fat content but that's only because of the sesames and it's a "good for me fat" anyway. It sure beats a chocolate bar, coconut cheese cake or butter cookies as far as fat's concerned. That's the way I look at it.<br /><br />Besides, they're very satisfying, high in fiber and totally vegetarian if that's important to you. They have a buttery, crunchy taste that squashes cravings and hunger pains quickly so that I'm not tempted to eat something unhealthy. And they're allergy friendly.

I think this is a great snack for kids and good alternative to candy since it at least has some nutrition.  Not a good diet snack though, as it is pretty high in calories and fat with all those sesame seeds.

review/text: Of all the Gloria Jean flavored coffee's I have to say in my own opinion, Butter Toffee is by far the best. It has a stronger smell than flavor and blends well with stronger un-flavored coffee (I use Timothy's Black Magic). I really enjoy flavored coffee although the husband does not...but he LOVES this one. That has got to say something.<br /><br />It's a perfect dessert coffee as well as the first cup that greets you in the morning.

And I don't think it tastes like mud. lol. Most coffee lovers will enjoy this to the fullest. The only drawback is that all 50 come in the same box which happens to be the same box they ship in.

review/text: Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee is the best flavored coffee I have ever had. 50 pack would save some money per cup except that the last two boxes have had several K-cups where the tops are not sealed.  If you don't notice the problem before you brew then the coffee grounds blow by the normal brew process and you have grounds all over the brewer. I had 8 bad K-cups in the previous order and had seven in this order. Not very good quality control.  But the coffee is the greatest. I haven't found the K-cup defect in other flavors.

review/text: I bought this for my mom, a coffee addict, and she only has positive things to say about this flavor. I do, however, reccomend buying a variety unless, of course, you don't mind having 50 of one flavor. Nothing like stocking up on a good thing!

review/summary: Dessert for breakfast!
review/text: I really enjoy this coffee.  The butter toffee flavor is subtle, but definitely present. I drink my coffee black, and I can imagine that adding sugar and / or cream would enhance the toffee flavor, but as someone who enjoys the flavor of coffee itself, this subtlety is just enough to make me think I'm indulging myself with a treat for breakfast.

review/summary: Excellent with Butter Cream Creamer, by itself or any other creamer
review/text: So far out of all the coffee we have tried for the Kreuger, this is our absolute favorite. It goes well with the International Delights Butter Cream creamer that we get at Target. It also goes well with Coffee Mates Cinamon creamer and I'm sure many others. In order to know if you have similar tastes to ours, we like Starbucks White Chocolate Mocha's, pretty much any Frappichino although caramel is our favorite, and I can even enjoy straight espresso or a campana if I like something sweet. In spite of my ability to enjoy a well pulled espresso shot, I do not like strong and bold coffee's like morning blends or french roast. In fact, the Butter Toffee coffee without creamer is still a bit strong for me as are most of the K-Kup blends. But this is by far my favorite k-kup.

review/summary: Very good flavor, but miss the old pack sizes
review/text: We prefer flavored coffees and as far as those go, this is a very good.  Just a touch of sweetness resembling Butter Toffee, and a balanced amount of caffeine.  These are not a dark roast, but not a light weight either - I get just right amount of caffeine bump from this one.<br /><br />Two "con's":<br />1) I miss the old sizes.  50 is a LOT of any one flavor.  By the time we get through it, we're tired of the flavor. I'm sure there were some manufacturing efficiencies or something in it for the manufacturer, but from where I'm sitting, the 22ct is sorely missed.<br />2) That said, they need MORE flavors.  Not only all the same, but also variety packs.  Please bring those back!<br /><br />Overall, five stars for the coffee itself, but one star lost for pack size and lack of other flavors in a variety pack.

review/text: I recently purchased a 50 X pack of Butter Toffee K Cups. I'm experiencing an alarming number of K cups bursting during the brewing process. It seems as though some of the K Cups aren't as pressurized as other and the ones with less pressure seem to be the ones that burst.

review/text: When my daughter brought home this box of Butter Toffee coffee, I've got to admit I was a bit skeptical.  However, it soon proved to be a family favorite.<br /><br />As with most flavored coffees, this one is more of a medium roast.  So it will not taste as good on the larger cup sizes - I suggest the 6oz to 8oz max.  The flavor is very good with a rich round and smooth finish.  This will make the whole kitchen smell nice.<br /><br />The best thing about this flavor is that it really cuts down on the need for sweeteners and cream. It is so smooth you can almost drink it straight.  I prefer this as a desert type coffee with just a touch of sweetener.  For my daughter, it is her favorite daily cup.<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this flavor to those who enjoy a rich, buttery smooth, flavored coffee.

I have offered this item to people who do not sweeten their coffee and they have told me it does not taste the same. Butter Toffee to me should be sweet so I understand what they are saying.<br /><br />As far as Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee, it is a good tasting cup of coffee and the flavor is consistent.

review/summary: Butter Toffee?  Not really
review/text: I have tried this flavor every way possible.  Cream, cream w/sugar, black w/sugar, black, small, medium, large, made with the B40 machine at work, made with the B70 machine at my house...  Every way tasted bad.  I like a lot of different flavored coffees and flavored k-cups, I don't know why this tastes so bad.

review/summary: Just didn't like it.....
review/text: This may be just personal preference, but I just don't like this flavor AND it's watery. I shouldn't have ordered 50 ct package without having tried it first.(duh) Compared to the others I've tasted, it is like a much cheaper coffee. I last used the small cup setting on my Keurig, and will continue to do that to take care of the watery component. We will drink it, but we wont enjoy it! HA!

review/summary: Too Expensive
review/text: Wonderful coffee, and I used to subscribe and have it<br />automatically delivered, but I quit because the price<br />just kept going up so I bought a set of "eco brew"<br />reusable pots for my Keurig, I love them and I am<br />thrilled that I am not throwing a K-Cup away every day.

review/summary: This flavor is just ok
review/text: I was excited to get this flavor and the reviews were great. I am sorry to report that I am not impressed at all with this flavor. It is somewhat weak in taste and I can BARELY taste the butter toffee. I will not buy this again.

review/summary: Not the worst k cup out there, but there are too many better alternatives to justify this one...
review/text: My only foray into Gloria Jean's brand of k cups before this one was when I tried the Hazelnut flavor that was included in the sample pack that was included with our new brewer.  Needless to say, I was unimpressed with it.  I had all but written Gloria Jean off as a weak coffee brand when my boyfriend's sister gave us a few of her Butter Toffee k cups to try out, insisting they were much better than the Hazelnut.  At that point I hadn't tried another butter toffee flavored coffee from any of the other brands, so I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />What a letdown.<br /><br />Butter toffee does smell like its namesake when it is being brewed.  I had a lot of hope for it because of how it made my kitchen smell during the brewing process.  The flavor follow-up was nothing short of weak, though.  For one thing, I couldn't detect any butter toffee flavor in the coffee itself at all.  Shame.  The other downside is that, instead of being just a slightly boring, but good cup of regular coffee, this one somehow managed to be bitter and weak at the same time.  Nothing robust or flavorful about it.  Just weak coffee with a terrible aftertaste.<br /><br />So I've only had the chance to try two of Gloria Jean's flavors so far, but I definitely won't be going out of my way to try any others.  I'll stick to Timothy's and Caribou Coffee from now on.

review/summary: Just ok...
review/text: I personally think this one smells better than it tastes.  Nice buttery aroma, but kind of watery when I drink it - even after doctoring it up with cream and sugar.  If that doesn't fix it, nothing will.  I had high hopes, but this one just doesn't pack enough of a flavor punch for me.  Will not repurchase.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: After lots and lots of research, I have broken down and bought my first Keurig.  Ho-le-crap!!!!  The coffee is so good.  It came with a sampler pack and the Butter Toffee is by far my favorite!!!  I brewed a cup Saturday morning and my child came down stairs asking if I made french toast for breakfast! HAHAHAH!  This is the best flavored coffee I have had in a long long time!!!

review/summary: Great tasting coffee!
review/text: I love Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee for Keurig K-cups. It really has the taste of butter toffee and is not bitter. I just wish they made it in decaf. I also like that it is being shipped in one large box instead of two smaller ones--less waste and fewer boxes to recycle.

review/text: Aroma is super, but flavor is lacking.  This is better when creamer and sweetener are added to bring out the flavor which tends to wash out.

review/text: The Butter Toffee smells real good but when I set the brew size at 7.25 ozs. It was a little light on flavor. The coffee taste was good overall but, I like a stronger flavor when I choose a flavored coffee.

review/summary: Bitter and tastless
review/text: I've ordered this coffee a few times. The last batch I got had changed for the worse. It had no butter toffee flavor that the privious batches had, and it had a bad bitterness to it. I would chalk it up to "just a bad batch", however Gloria Jean's has been unresponsive to my multiple customer service request. When you call, they put you through to a voicemail line that ask you to leave a detailed message. I've done this three times with no response. I wouldn't pay for this product again.

review/text: This is one of our favorite kcups. We typically like our coffee a little stronger, but putting it on the medium water setting strengthens the flavor of the coffee. We order this on the Subscribe and Save, so this makes the price even more reasonable.

review/text: The coffee was what I wanted. I was not happy about the packaging. All the k-cups were loose in a packing box. It made me wonder where they all came from. There was no manufactured packages and of course there was not any expiration dates. Not sure if I would order from this place again.

review/text: I've had a Keuring brewer in one form or another for a few years now, and besides the sample packs, I must say these are the most disappointing K-kups yet.  Mabye I just like my coffee to taste like coffee, but this particular flavor has a very chemical taste to it, and leaves a pretty bad after taste. 1 star for working in my keurig, and one star for being cheap on Amazon.com!

review/summary: Generic "flavored coffee" aroma
review/text: This coffee doesn't smell like butter toffee, it just smells like "flavored coffee" which to me all smells very similar no matter what it's supposed to smell like--pecan praline, blueberry cream, amaretto, even "Norseman Grog" which is a combination of vanilla, rum and caramel.  They all smell pretty much the same to me, even different brands.  I was hoping this one would be different because of the high reviews, but it isn't.  I gave it two stars because the coffee itself is good and not bitter like some.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: This is a great flavor!  First, my husband likes lots of cream & lots of sugar in his coffees.  One day I saw this in the store & bought it because the name made it sound promising - my husband LOVED it.  He barely puts any cream in his coffee because he says it tastes so smooth.<br />My neighbor also has a Keurig & we swap flavors to get more of a variety.  I gave her some of this, and she was sold!  This is all she drinks now, too!<br />Because this stuff is so great, we obviously buy in big quantities.  This packaging is great!  Just one box w/ a bunch of Kcups thrown in.  We don't have to mess w/ the plastic over the two boxes, etc. etc.
