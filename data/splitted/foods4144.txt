review/summary: Excellent sweetner
review/text: This is the best stevia I have used. It has an excellent 'natural' flavor with no after taste....and is quite sweet. It is organic and there is no junk in it like with Stevia In The Raw (loaded with dextrose) and many of the others.<br /><br />The only food I don't use it with is my coffee. I still enjoy the raw, organic cane sugar with the java.

review/summary: Dissappointing
review/text: Having given up sugar, I tried the traditional artificial sweeteners. Not wanting to poison my body with chemical sweeteners, I turned to Stevia. I didn't realize it would have such a strong aftertaste. It takes away the flavor of my good coffee which I find hard to drink unsweetened. Won't buy this product again.

review/summary: Bone and greed replaces nutrition
review/text: This is a shame. When Merricks introduced its canned cat foods, they were truly out-standing.  There was no filler of excess liver, no bone, no cartlidge, no cheap grindings swimming in gravy--things which are typical of the majority of cat food producers.  There was minimum grain and lots of turkey, in addition to the obvious nutritious veggies and berries. Merricks truly was the King. However, as I continued to buy over time, I noticed a distinct degrading of quality.  I usually buy directly from the company's website so I addressed these issues to them the day I found chunks of obvious poulty vertabra and cartlidge, large chunks--whole vertabra bones-- and ground, in a particular lot.  I had already seen the qualities of the foods going downhill but this addition of bone and cartlidge was upsetting. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and wrote to inform them that perhaps an "accident" had happened. They were cold, uncaring and wanted my remaining cans after I send them photographs of the foods, bones and cartlige matter and cans with the lot numbers clearly stamped. I admit I blew my stack at this attitude, but the last straw was receiving the final lot(which unfortunately I had ordered before the discovery of the literal garbage in the previous lot) and the result of the new came pouring out of the cans in a gray-ish brown mass of "gravy", with no visible pieces of turkey, just unhealthy-looking masses of liver and some cheap ground poultry that was hard and brittle to the fingers.  Merricks has been informed that they have a problem with quality control and the customer should be very aware that the lots differ dramatically. I'm very glad I kept and presevered the cans, bones and photographs as proof. If you want to pay premium prices for the kind of crap you throw away in your garbage every day then by all means buy Merricks and take a chance. It's feast or famine from a company who has clearly taken advantage of the fact that most consumers really don't bother looking at their cat's food. Shame on them for feeding cats and kittens bones and cartlidge and liver-filler. Merricks blows.

review/summary: Horrible Quality Control
review/text: Up until recently, I had been using his food exclusively, but after several disturbing incidents I have switched brands.  In the last few months have found cardboard, hair, and a bug in three separate varieties of Merrick dog and cat food. When I found the cardboard, I contacted the company with my findings and they apologized and mailed me a coupon. Since then, I have found hair in two varieties of dog food and the final straw last week was opening a can of cat food to find a dead fly right on the top of the food. There is no way that this food is being produced in a human facility. The quality is appalling -- especially at these prices. I have spent thousands on Merrick pet foods, but they have lost my business forever.

review/summary: Very up and down
review/text: I have had a very strange experience feeding my kitten Merrick food. The first time I gave it to her, she loved it and ate it all up. I was so happy I had found something that looked and smelt good and went ahead and ordered a case of 24. Much to my dismay, after 2 days of eating this food, she gets a stomach upset. I switched her back (over a period of days) to her old food, then back to Merrick again, and the same thing happened. Soft stools, tummy upset etc etc. I cannot feed her this stuff anymore. Now I am stuck with 20 odd cans of Merrick.

review/summary: The best cat food I have ever found
review/text: I am frankly shocked at the two other reviews I have seen here.  I have been a customer for nearly 3 years now.  I know the batches are slightly different due to the small batches made at a time, but the product has always been excellent, and while they did have a problem with shipping it out properly (which they fixed by changing the person in charge of it, perhaps they changed a lot of personel) the customer service has always been friendly, helpful and the only time I was asked to send something back (usually they tell me to keep it or give it to someone and send me out a new order, even if it's because my cats have decided to be finicky on a flavor - they sent me one they did like)they paid the postage and even had someone to come to my home to get it.  I have two cats and putting them on Merrick has allowed the thin one to fill out and the fat one to get slim, they just needed a really good cat food - no by-products, natural sources of vitamins, and human grade meat!  It smells good, and I joke to my husband that if things got tough, we could certainly eat this with no problem.  I have the highest regard for this award winning company and everything about them and their product.

review/summary: Gourmet Hot Cereal
review/text: I grew up eating this delicious hot cereal for breakfast. It is made of whole wheat with a little malt added. It's much tastier than cream of wheat which is made with bleached white flour. For those trying to limit their intake of refined carbs, it's an excellent choice. It is especially good with a mix of nuts and yogurt on top.

It has just the right balance in texture, with that hint of sweetness that makes its so tasty!  It's a shame it seems to hard to come by in some areas.  It doesn't seem to be sold in many grocery stores where I live (which is in a different area than where I grew up - seemed easier to come by there).

review/summary: Malt-O-Meal Recipe
review/text: I great up on Malt-O-Meal hot cereals on Sunday mornings. As I got old enough my father used to let me help him in the preparations. It remains one of my best memories growing up - spending time with family, good food, and a sense of accomplishment as a kids - who could ask for more?<br /><br />So I thought I would share my family's recipe. This recipe serves 2 to 4 adults, or maybe 5 to 6 kids.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />- Half cup of Malt-O-Meal<br />- about 3/4 this amount of sugar (more or less to taste). We use cane sugar, but you can use refined sugar. You could also use a portion of this in brown sugar. I have never liked more than 50% brown sugar though.<br />- about a quarter stick of butter (don't use the fake stuff). You can double this if you prefer a heavier feel.<br />- Milk (about 1-2 cups to taste, see directions below)<br /><br />Preparation:<br />- Start with a pan (not a non-stick variety - I use a wok) and melt the butter. Use medium to medium-low heat. Don't do this on high heat as you may burn the butter.<br />- Add the Malt-O-Meal to the pan after all the butter is melted and stir until the mix is a golden brown (it starts off brown, so your really looking for it to darken a touch). On medium, we're talking about maybe 1-2 minutes, on medium-low maybe 2-3 minutes. Make sure there are no clumps as they will remain in the final product.<br />- Add milk to taste. My preferred method is to add milk until it covers the whole mixture and then add about another half cup. This would typically be 1.5-2 cup. You can go a bit less or more depending on how fluffy you want the final product (more milk = more fluffy).<br />- Bring mix to boil while stirring. The mix will likely have started to thicken, so you may see air bubble breaking through.<br />- Simmer on low to desired consistency. Remember to keep stirring.<br />- Enjoy!<br /><br />We have tried this recipe with various cream of wheat blends and rice cereals, but always go back to Malt-O-Meal for the rich taste and texture. Don't worry it's plenty smooth, just filling. I'd love to hear if anyone has other ideas!

Unlike the NUK pacifiers which I think have more masculine designs, the MAM pacifiers are harder to find more Masculine designs.

In just a few minutes I had the Muffin Magic plugged in and the Whole Wheat Wild Blueberry muffin mix prepared.  This box, which says it makes 8 muffins, made 6 muffins in the appliance.<br /><br />Everyone loved them.  They're not overly sweet, but sweet enough so they can be eaten plain.  They would probably be excellent toasted with maybe a little butter and/or jam, but they didn't last long enough to find out.  Everyone ate them warm, right out of the Muffin magic machine.

review/text: Most muffin mixes out there have so much sugar they are essentially cupcakes.  Not these.  That said, perhaps because my palette is used to a sweeter muffin I found myself wanting a spread of butter on them (which I would never do with, say, a Betty Crocker muffin).  The second batch I made I sprinkled a little sugar on top and added some extra blueberries; that helped quite a bit.  My kiddos think they're great either way; that's a great after school snack for them to come home to.  Another reviewer summed it up well by saying they are good, not great.  I will buy them again just because they are healthy.  Remember that in terms of rating foods, one person's 5 stars is another person's 1 star.  It's a matter of personal preference.

review/summary: Delicious Pancakes!
review/text: I ordered these to make a healthier brand of muffins. They suffice to that end, though they really don't compare to other muffin mixes I've tried - where they shine is making pancakes. I love thick, hearty pancakes and the taste of these pancakes really compliments maple syrup. I will be purchasing more!

review/text: This mix is a pantry staple for me.  I view it as healthy breakfast convenience food, for those mornings when I want something a bit special, but don't want to put in the time making muffins from "scratch."  The muffins are hearty and not too sweet, which is a good thing.  (These are not dessert muffins.)  Hodgson Mill has recently increased the quantity of blueberries, a plus.  I've also added raisins and cinnamon for variety.

review/summary: Breakfast Blend - Nothing Special
review/text: Long time Keurig user and lifetime coffee drinker.  Breakfast Blend is for the most part a plain cup of coffee.  Light and smooth, but with a slight bitterness at the end.  I still prefer Donut Shop as a light everyday go to coffee choice, but wanted to try a box of Green Mountain BB.  Probably won't purchase again.  No one in the house has stopped me and said, "thats a great cup of coffee".  It's just plain and blah.  I'll probably struggle to finish the box honestly.

review/summary: Fine, But There's Better Out There
review/text: The Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups are pretty decent.  The main selling point of this product is its price point.  Is it good coffee?  No, not really.  Is it good coffee for 60 cents a cup?  It sure can be.  These K-Cups taste good on both size settings of Keurig machines.<br /><br />I would like to point out though, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop</a> brand of K-Cups are sold for the same price.  The Donut Shop coffee is a bit smoother in my opinion, and again, it's only 60 cents a cup.  Either way, the coffee you get won't be great, but it will be good for what you pay for.

But unlike some of the reviews of Green Mountain Breakfast Blend I've never had a bad batch of this blend.  If you enjoy a light roast this one seems perfect to me.  It is  available in both regular and decaf.  And for extra savings you may want to order the 50 count box from Amazon which is only $0.60/cup now.

review/text: I typically prefer espresso when I drink coffee beverages. However, when my in-laws bought me the Keurig I decided to start drinking regular coffee. I enjoy Breakfast Blend because it is a rich, smooth coffee without being too acidic. I can make iced coffee out of it and it doesn't get too watered down or lose it's flavor (assuming I wait about 15 minutes after brewing for the coffee to cool before pouring it over ice).

review/summary: Almost makes my wife happy
review/text: My wife likes her coffee really weak and finding that in a K-cup has been a tough job. I like stronger coffees than the Breakfast Blend but I also enjoy this. It's still too strong for my wife but it's as close as I've been able to find to satisfy her taste (she adds water to every cup no matter which setting it's brewed on). I've been unable to find a "lighter" K-cup so we've been drinking this blend for years now. If anyone knows of a "weaker" K-cup coffee, let me know!

review/summary: My husband loves it!
review/text: I bought this for my husband because he wanted a breakfast blend and isn't too fond of the Newmans. He likes the Dunkin Donuts but it's pricey. he said this blend is up to par with the dunkin brand. You only get 12 in the dunkin package and it's over $12. he likes this better than the donut house also.

review/summary: Just Right Blend
review/text: This stuff's great, especially, as suggested by its name, first thing in the morning. It's not too dark, but it's not so mild that you don't feel like you've had a cup of coffee.<br />We think it tastes even better made with bottled water.<br />Order with confidence.

review/text: My wife and I bought the Keurig and started experimenting with coffees.  Most were too strong, but this Breakfast Blend hit it right on the head.  Of course it's a matter of personal taste, but if you don't like your coffee as strong as Starbucks typically is, this is a great coffee.  Love that Keurig!

review/summary: best coffee ever
review/text: I have tried all the k-cups that came with my Keurig at Christmas and by far the best of all for me was the breakfast blend.  Not too strong or weak, JUST RIGHT.  I use the 12oz size for my mug and a little half and half and enjoy!  I was not enjoying the coffees I kept trying so bought some medium roasts at the store but still not satisfied with the taste. By far the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is it for me.

review/text: A very mild, but pleasant blend. Not as strong as I normally prefer, but the taste is so good I drink it anyhow. It's perfect if you like to drink coffee late in the day but don't want the stomach side effects that often comes with it.<br /><br />Definitely in my top 3 of all K-Cup blends.

review/text: Having a delicious, hot, instant cup of coffee in the morning is the perfect picker-upper, eye-opener, and motivater to leave those toasty blankets behind.  BUT it took more than just the brewer to do all that.  We received ours for a Christmas gift along with our first pack of coffee and quickly had to order a new supply from you.  Why did the world wait so long for K-Cup Green Mountain Coffee?  We feel like kicking up our heels--at least mentally!  AMAZON, you are s-o-o-o good and up-to-date.

review/summary: Great breakfast coffee
review/text: I love it! I received a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas and have been trying all the different flavors. While I enjoy a flavored coffee, I like my first cup of the day to be just "coffee". I've found the perfect one with Nantcket Blend. It's not too strong, not too weak. And the twin pack is a great value. Haven't found it at the grocery store so I'm very pleased to see it offered at Amazon. While I have a supply of various flavors, Nantucket Blend is my "go to" first thing in the morning. Best way to describe it? Smoooooooth.

review/summary: Nice mild coffee that still delivers a morning kick...
review/text: My days of enjoying bold, dark coffee times have long past. Maybe it's age, or maybe it was my time in the navy when midwatch coffee was always black and bitter, and the only thing that changed when the daywatch came around was a freshening of the grounds.<br /><br />This coffee is mild without being weak, and is a nice way to start the day (or finish up a meal and settle with a good book).<br /><br />Good choice for your K-cup pantry.

review/text: This coffee is perfect for those who don't like strong coffee shop coffee.  It's mild yet has a bold flavor.  I actually make two cups with each k-cup.  That helps me save lots of money and works perfectly when I want more than one cup in the morning.  Second cup is lighter, but it still has good flavor.

review/summary: Not What Expected....
review/text: I ordered this coffee under the impression that it was a medium roast,that was according to the brief description & by zooming in the box on my laptop. On the the side of the box it stated medium. When the coffee arrived today it is not medium it is light. No medium on the box at all, just light. I am very disapointed with this purchase as I wanted at least a medium roast flavor. To be able to get a full flavor at all you will need to use a very small amount of water & make a very small cup of coffee. I'm sure I could send it back but the hassle is not worth it, but will not buy again. If you like extremely light coffee this is for you, if you like to taste your coffee this is No good. I will order bold from now on. As far as taste there is none unless you make about a 4 oz. cup even then it's not very good.<br />Amazon did ship very fast,I received the order sooner than expected & it was packaged very well.<br />Too bad the coffee was not what I ordered/ expected.

I was sent an email from the company ahead of the delivery so I was aware and all was fine.

review/summary: MY FAVORITE K-CUP!
review/text: Green Mountain Breakfast Blend, is by far my favorite k-cup coffee!!! I was a die-hard Starbucks girl for years, and now that I live in a town without one-I use my Keurig daily. I don't like strong or dark coffees, so this one is nice and mild for me. I also use fat-free, flavored creamers and they taste great with this coffee blend. I also love getting this shipped to me fast on Amazon. The boxes that I found at Walmart, Kohl's, etc... had less kcups in them. I find that ordering them online via Amazon is a great value!

review/text: I don't know if I got a bad batch but this coffee has a nasty plastic flavor. I think the Nantucket Blend is good and the Dark Magic is excellent. My room mate tried it twice and she also thinks the Breakfast Blend is terrible.  Green Mountain makes some very good coffees but in my experience this isn't one of them.

review/text: This is my house's go to breakfast blend coffee.  Not too strong- but not weak we find the flavor very enjoyable and it a nice middle of the road coffee for guests.  My wife likes with cream and sugar but tastes equally at home black.  Doesn't seem to have a ton of pep- I can drink multiple cups in a sitting.  A little planning ahead (2 days with FREE PRIME shipping) and this package is a much better deal than the big boxes or supermakets.  Highly recommended.

review/text: I received some Green Moutain Coffee K-Cups as a sample test through Buzzagent and I was quite pleased with this.  It's not too strong of a coffee, but not too weak of a coffee either, it has a great blend of flavor.  It has a smooth taste and is not to bitter like some coffees tend to be.  Good price on this brand as well.  Overall I would have to say this a keeper for my morning ritual.
