review/summary: A little goes a long way
review/text: What a great idea - especially if you don't want soda calories, but something besides plain water.  Two "squirts" is all I need in a Sigg water bottle to provide the flavor that I need.  The bottle says you get 24 servings out of it, but with my 2 little squirts I'd say I get a little bit more than 24 servings.  So for the money, I definitely think these are a good deal.  I get more mango flavor than I do peach out of this.  Be careful - if you overdo it this can taste a little cough syrupy.  The reason for a star deduction is because I've had other flavors that I like a little better, but overall I would definitely recommend Mio flavors!

review/summary: Nice concept in flavoring water
review/text: First of all, the bottle is just downright cute.  It's not very big--easily stored as it doesn't take up much space.  You can even take it with you because there is an extra precaution they take to make sure the bottle is sealed.  If you read the directions, you must hear two clicks to make sure it's closed properly.  It's also a nice concept, this liquid water enhancer.<br />The flavor of the Mango Peach Milo is quite tasty.  I like it as simply a slightly-flavored water with one squirt and also as a super-sweet drink with several squirts.  It can be adjusted to taste.<br />Be careful with your squeezes as the liquid comes out fast and at a perfect line to wherever you point it.

review/summary: Oh my, Mio is sweet!
review/text: I'm one of those guys who just doesn't drink as much water as he should. It's not that I don't like the taste, it's just that I like what I drink to have some kind of taste. So I was glad to be able to try this Mio water flavoring. And it's good. I like it. It has a decent, fruity consistency and is really quite sweet. It doesn't, however, add a lot of calories. The liquid additive is easy to put into a bottle or glass, as the spout seals up and keeps the liquid contained until you give it a firm squeeze. When the bottle is squeezed, it squirts the liquid in a strong, straight, steady stream (alliteratively speaking). A little liquid goes a long way, and since I don't need to add much flavor to enjoy the water, I actually got quite a few more servings than the 24 mentioned on the label. I will say, however, that this is really quite strong stuff. Two squirts would probably put you off your lunch, the taste being so strong. And actually, one of my gripes is that the squirt bottle makes it difficult to determine how much of the stuff you've added to your water. Something along the lines of a drip bottle or a clear bottle with a couple gradations on the side might have helped. Anyway, this is a good, portable water flavoring option. I don't give it five stars because of the quantity issue and because there's nothing really outstanding about it, but I do give it four stars for being what it advertises and tasting great. Drink up!

review/summary: Kind of Sweet, but Convenient Too
review/text: I tried this product for a very simple reason: I drink tea all day long and sometimes I just want hot water, but don't necessarily want another cup of tea. I thought his would be a convenient thing to have in my office: boil a cup of water and toss in a few drops for flavor. And it is actually pretty good for that. I found that the flavor was good, but I have probably been putting too much in (one long squeeze, rather than drops) and it's a bit too sweet (it almost tastes like Cool Aid if you put too much in). But still, for a quick flavoring, it's not that bad. If you have a water cooler with a hot-water tap at work, this would probably be nice to keep in your desk. I would imagine in summer if you (like me) carry a water bottle everywhere, this would be good, too.<br /><br />I just happened to see a big display for Mio in the local grocery store, so apparently they are ramping up their marketing. If it gets successful, I'd say it falls into that "Why didn't I think of that?" category of inventions.

review/summary: Versatility and great flavor!
review/text: We really enjoyed the Mio Mango Peach.  It is easy to use and you can add as little or as much flavoring as you want without waste.  I prefer things less sweet and so do the kids but hubby likes his drinks sweeter.  I used to waste tubes of crystal light on the go as I would just used a 1/3 and the rest would end up spilled or in the trash.  We can add it to plain yogurt or tea as well.  If you like things really sweet than it may be a bit pricey as I can't see the bottle lasting that long but for just a little flavor it goes a long way.  It is certainly cheaper (and better for the environment) than buying drinks while out.  I wish that the flavors were natural rather than artificial so we will only be using it as an occasional treat but it's tasty and better than drinking many other things on the go.

review/summary: Neat, Sweet and Petite (Enough to Carry)
review/text: MIO is a great product for anyone on the go who would like a little splash of fruit taste in their beverage.  The bottle is very small and lightweight - about the height of a typical bottle of vanilla extract.  This makes it easy to transport or stow in the door pocket of your car or your office desk drawer.  The flavor is very sweet without being overly artificial, which I didn't expect.  This potency of the flavor prevents me from fretting about the price because a little goes a long way.  I typically use only a few drops for a glass of water - at this pace, a bottle will likely last me almost a month.<br /><br />Definitely recommended as an on-the-go kick for your daily water.

review/summary: MIO mango peach
review/text: MIO mango peach liquid flavor is a wonderful way to flavor water to drink when you don't like water. I have trouble taking in enough fluids in the winter because I am less thirsty. Flavoring a large glass of water with the MIO really helps me to drink the water I need. It is delicious and with just a couple of squirts from the small convenient bottle into a 12 ounce glass of tap water makes a great drink. It tastes 100 percent better than the powders  and is much easier to use. I will be buying more of these.

review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: I rarely drink anything other than water, but from time to time I do desire something with a little more flavor. MiO Mango Peach provides that break from the norm, and more! With no more than a couple of drops, the flavor is amazingly substantial. Of course, one has the option to use as much or little as one desires. I have had a few of the mix-in water enhancers and I have to say that MiO is my new favorite.<br /><br />One warning: if you are going to transport the container after it has been opened, I would recommend placing it inside of a plastic baggie to avoid any unintentional leaks.

review/summary: Expensive and Mediocre
review/text: After using the Mango Peach Mio liquid, I can safely say that crystal light and other such water flavorings have nothing to worry about.<br /><br />The main problem with Mio comes from its lack of solid instructions or measurements.  Apparently a "squeeze" should do for 8ozs.  What exactly is a squeeze?  A good hold, a brief push, somewhere in between?  I could not really tell you as whatever I did seemed to bounce back and forth between just coloring the liquid and eating a packet of sweetner.  All in all, I got about 7 large cups of flavored water out of one packet.  For 4 bucks, that is pretty tough.  Especially when the flavor you get is mediocre at best.<br /><br />There are better products out there.

review/summary: Great convenience, good flavor too!
review/text: I am a frequent user of the little packet drink mixes used to flavor water. Compared to soft drinks and vending machine prices, they're cheaper and better tasting nine times out of ten. I was excited to try MIO after seeing it in the aisle alongside my tried-and-true powder mixes. And, I must say that I am very pleased overall! The convenience of the little vial is definitely unparalleled. You can put basically an entire 24 drinks worth of flavor in palm of your hand or purse. You dnt have to mess around with potentially messy powders and ou can dilute or concentrate our beverage EXACTLY to the extent you choose, making MIO adaptable to large many-serving drink containers as well.<br /><br />The, peach mango flavor is quite good but I'd be interested to try some other favors next time. The potency of the flavor wasn't quite what I expected after 4 "squeezes" but was easily remedied with 2 extra squeezes. My favorite thing about these is the mess-free, no powder, tiny container design. The convenience is great!

review/summary: A Tasty, Versatile Product
review/text: I love mango and peach flavors so I was thrilled to be able to try out Mio.  First of all, I loved the packaging.  It comes in a small, plastic bottle with a tight top.  This makes it portable... you could tuck it into your pocket or your purse.  The second thing loved about it is that you can add as much flavoring as you like.  I prefer a light flavor so just a little squeeze did it for me.  I drink tons of unsweetened ice tea and I can add a drop to a glass or a few drops to a pitcher.  I also added a drop to a bottle of water and it was delicious.  I don't drink enough water so having the Mio flavoring will help me drink more.  This liquid can be added to so many things:  yogurt, seltzer, soft drinks, cocktails... you name it.  It's economical and versatile.  What more do you want?

review/text: Whoever coined the phrase "first world problem" ought to have trademarked it before letting it escape their lips. I'm not sure that a "water enhancer" is totally morally conscionable, but ignoring that nagging fear I will say that this does what it's supposed to do, and makes water pretty compulsively drinkable, if that's your aim. Tasty and easy to use, best in Starbucks water, which is triple-filtered for your tastebuds, those little elitists.

review/text: I usually use one or two single serving drink powders per day at work, so I brought in the MIO to try out as a replacement.  It is better in every way.  The bottle lasted much longer than I anticipated.  I can mix it to just the right strength.  It has a smoother texture, compared to powders which always seem to end up with a little undissolved grit.  The flavor is great.  MIO will definitely be replacing powdered drink mixes for me.  I am looking forward to trying all the other flavors.

review/summary: Delicious and Dissolves Well
review/text: I've been trying to develop healthier eating habits this year, so I stick to drinking plain water most of the time.  It's good for me, but it gets boring, and I'm thankful that I had the opportunity to try this product.  It's calorie-free but full of flavor, even in small amounts.  My favorite aspect of it, though, is that it dissolves really well.  I have tried powdered drink mixes, and there are always a few grains on the side or bottom of the glass, but this drink is a liquid.  If you put it in the glass before adding water, you don't even need to stir.  No gross residue on the glass, and no gross residue on your teeth.  The next time I'm in the mood for a flavoring for water, this is definitely the product I will choose.<br /><br />(I should note that I have only tried the Mango Peach flavor, which doesn't exactly taste like real fruit but is still sweet and invigorating.  Some of the other available flavors may be more to your preference, but I tried to focus my main review on the characteristics of the product that I suspect are common to all of the flavors.)

review/summary: A Bit TOO Sweet
review/text: I tried both the Mango Peach and the Peach Tea Mio flavors and while I liked them both, I definitely prefer the Peach Tea. The Mango Peach is just TOO sweet for my taste, providing a flavor that tastes a little too much like Peach flavored sugar water. The Mango should even the flavor out but it doesn't. This flavor is best when your water is ice cold (as in full of ice). The closer to room temperature your water gets the sweeter the flavor gets and more difficult to drink. And this review comes from someone who used very little (one squirt). My husband likes it better than I do, but he also adds 4 packets of sweetener to his coffee.

review/summary: Good taste, but a messy travel companion
review/text: We do many activities that include our Camelbak drink systems, so we're always looking for something that will make water taste better, especially when it's late on a hot afternoon and the H20 is luke-warm and has that not-so-pleasant plastic aftertaste.<br /><br />When this arrived, I could instantly tell if we did take it on trips, it would definitely be stored in a ziploc baggie, since some liquid had already leaked around the seal. Although the cap closes with a nice snap, it is possible to gently squeeze the sides and have the top pop up. I haven't tested this with elevation changes, but I have a feeling this could be an issue, especially if I'm carrying it in a motorcycle side bag, I'm decently certain the vibration, temperature, and elevation changes would cause a leak.<br /><br />I might still consider using this, but would transfer it to a small Nalgene container (leak proof), since my husband and I both did enjoy the flavor of this Mio Mango Peach over Crystal Lite. We both feel it's a bit less sugary with slightly more "real" fruit flavor.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like Mango/Peach at all but does enhance your H2O drinking pleasure
review/text: I drink a lot of water, especially during workouts and while at work. Before getting the MIO, I have never heard of a "specific brand" water enhancer before. The closest thing I could compare to enhancing your drinking water was adding a slice of lemon in some restaurants and that was it. Getting a chance to try this gave me a different perspective of water in its variety all together. The MIO water enhancer gives a dash of creativity in the way you drink this life-giving liquid. Adding a few squirts of the MIO Mango Peach to a glass of water gives it flavor that one can tolerate. But the flavor is far from Mango or Peach. It just gives it a sweet flavor for your to enjoy water in a different way. I like the fact that it is free from Caffeine, Fat, Calories, Sodium and all other stuff that you may find from drinking other not so healthy beverages. It is artificially sweetened with Sucralose and Acesulfame Potassium, which after doing a bit of research, are both non-caloric sweeteners. In fact, Sucralose is actually Splenda so you do not need to concern yourself about caloric intake when it comes to drinking your MIO-enhanced H2O. Overall a pleasant and new experience in the way you drink water except it is far from having a Mango or Peach taste.

review/text: I'm pretty much in denial that summer is over, if the sun shines and it feels even the least bit balmy. I can over look the naked trees and on a really good day, even the snow. Even though I got Mio Liquid Water Enhancer in the late fall, the Mango Peach flavor is a flashback to hot summer days.<br />MiO tastes clean, sweet and delicious with no caffiene,calories and no aftertaste. To use, just flip it, tip it then sip it. When you have the taste where you want it, two clicks closes the handy little container that would fit easily in a purse, pocket or lunch box.  You make it as strong or as light as you like, keeping in mind a little goes a long way. Using  � a teaspoon  to eight ounces of water, as a rule of thumb, this little bottle packs in 24 servings of yummy goodness. The color is a pleasing rich orange and, if you happen to be observant, is Kosher. This product doesn't need refrigeration after opening which means you can take it with you anywhere, or leave in your desk at work when you need a splash of something tasty.<br />Soon, we'll be into the slimming season, and if you're one who likes fruit flavored sports drinks, you will definitely enjoy this blend.

review/summary: Tastes good, but leaves an after-taste
review/text: Not being a big water drinker, I thought these little flavor products would give me more incentive to drink more water which is obviously healthy.  Their small size makes them very easy to keep with me.  Just slip one into a pocket and wherever you can get a glass or bottle of water, you can have Mango/Peach flavored water. What's really great is no calories.<br /><br />There is no big issue or secret to making Mio flavored water.  Add a few drops and gently stir. You can add just a little or a lot to customize the beverage to your taste. The one thing I really like is that the Mio concentrate dissolves in the water unlike the dry powdered mixes which always seem to sink to the bottom.<br /><br />They do taste great at first.  I found the taste was pleasant without being too sugary for me.  But before finishing one small 8 oz glass, I started tasting an after-taste.  The taste is bad, just stale.  It is hard to describe but, everyone will recognize it when it happens.<br /><br />The drinks do work as advertised and they taste good at first, but I'd rather not drink something that leaves a stale taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, November 2011

review/summary: MiO My
review/text: I've been curious about these MiO Liquid "Water Enhancers" so I tried the Mango Peach flavor.  It comes in a cool little bottle with a flip lid and non drip type nozzle.  So, if you were so inclined, you could easily carry one around in your pocket.<br /><br />About two quick squirts into a bottle or cup of water (I prefer a bottle so I can shake it) is enough to flavor your water.  And it is a decent flavor.  Not too sweet but fruity.  Honestly the Mango Peach tastes like watermelon to me but that's fine.<br /><br />One item of note is that these are not health products.  They do not have vitamins.  They only flavor water.  I just wanted to mention that because I was not sure myself before I tried one.<br /><br />So it's a cool little product and if you drink a lot of water and want some flavor in it you could do worse.  And it is portable and lasts a pretty long while.  I'd certainly try some of the other flavors.

review/text: If you want to improve the taste of water without having to tote it all with you, then you can simply get the water from wherever you are and simply add as much of the Mio liquid (usually a few drops per glass will do)as you like and you've got a great tasting drink!

review/summary: Beats MiO Sweet Tea
review/text: Mango Peach isn't the worst of the beverage enhancing MiO products, but it certainly isn't the best. Alone the taste is a little much, the good thing about Mango Peach however is that it is more versatile than the other flavors. You could drink Mango Peach just mixed with plain water. Or you could add it to teas, lemonades, or mixed drinks. Some complain that MiO isn't cost effective but that would only be the case if you use a heavy dose with each mixing. I'd say with a standard squeeze you can get about 20 drinks out of MiO, it all really depends on the amount of flavor you desire. The small, easy to carry packaging makes MiO far more convenient than a bunch of little Crystal Light packs. As a product overall I give MiO five stars, as Mango Peach I can only give it about three.

review/summary: Handy container for water enhancer
review/text: Believe it or not, I'd neve heard of a water enhancer before I decided to try it as it was part of the Amazon Vine program.  I'm a Diet Pepsi person and adore carbonated beverages, so I was leery of what this would taste like.  To my amazement, I actually liked it and will try the other flavors.  I especially liked the MiO container as it takes up practically no space in my kitchen.  A nice product.

review/summary: Excellent addition to your bottled water!
review/text: I liked the Peach version of this product so much that I also ordered this peach mango.  It's orange, bright orange in color (think Kool-Aid) and is very refreshing.  The flavor is quite peachy-mnngo too.  It's artificially sweetened with ant poison (Splenda) and contains no caffeine.  Other than the bad stuff, it tastes rather nice.  It isn't tea, but more like a Kool-Aid drink and in fact, actually reminds you of it.  I've come to like this product quite a bit, and am excited to try other flavors.  Not too excited about the high price, however!  These are about $4 each and only give you 24 glasses of beverage before they're done.  Not much value on the dollar there.  Nice product, just look for a good price!  Recommend!

review/text: There's no doubt this tastes good.  It makes your tap water taste better and in bottled water it is a great, no calorie way to add flavor.  Figuring out just how much to put in takes some time, so don't get frustrated.  There isn't much difference between too weak and too strong, so woek your way up.

review/summary: Easy and Tasty
review/text: Mio Mango Peach Water Flavor comes in a handy small package that lets you instantly add sugar-free, calorie-free flavor to any water. You can use it at the gym, at work, in a restaurant, you name it.<br /><br />The small plastic container - about the size of a deck of cards - has a snap-tight lid and holds 24 servings of flavoring. To add flavor to water you simply open up the lid, squirt in the flavoring, and stir or shake the water. The liquid quickly dissolves /spreads throughout the water and gives it a flavor.<br /><br />The mango peach flavor is light and gentle - certainly more like drinking a punch of this flavor than a freshly pureed combination of those two fruits. But you can't fault it too much for that. It's not cloyingly sweet, and since you are the one mixing it up, you can make the flavor as strong or light as you wish.<br /><br />This is one of the unit's weaknesses, though. You have in essence a squeeze-toy and are squeezing it manually with your hand to get liquid to come out. This is far from an exact science. There's no fine line between a teaspoon and a tablespoon. You need to squirt less and then add a little more if you need to. There's no way, of course, to unsquirt the flavoring once it's in the water. The most you could do is add more water.<br /><br />Still, I have to say I think this is fairly brilliant. In the past there were powder options to carry with you that were messy and hard to use. You'd spill the powder. You'd have trouble getting the powder to really mix into the liquid. With this liquid flavoring option, it's so much simpler. The unit squirts without dripping. The liquid blends into the water pretty much instantly. It carries easily in your purse and with its 24-serving ability it means if a friend or two want some as well you can share.<br /><br />For nutrition, there's no calories, no fat, no sodium, no carbs, no protein, no nothing. It adds flavor to your water and nothing else. This is a great way to get you to drink more water, which is important for your health!<br /><br />The sweeteners used here are sucralose and acesulfame potassium. The amounts are so tiny (under 2%) that I really wouldn't worry about that and, again, if you're currently not drinking enough water and this will help you do that, then I'm all in favor of that.<br /><br />Well recommended!

review/summary: handy, no calorie flavoring for your water...
review/text: I try to drink at least 8 8 oz. glasses of water a day, and I don't know about you, but water can get a little boring.  So, occasionally I like the flavors you can buy to put in the waters to make them more fun.  If they taste great I'm more apt to get my water in.  I have never tried a liquid version of a water enhancer, but thought these looked interesting.  The container is small, small enough to fit in the palm of your hand and if you do a squirt of flavor for every 8 oz. you should get 24 uses out of the container.  The nice thing though is that you can tailor it yourself, more if you like a deep flavor and less if you just want a hint.  That's one thing you can't do neatly with the dry versions.  I also like that the size is small.  With this size I could have it in my desk at work to pump my water up a notch or two.  The flavor, mango peach is delicious-not too sweet, just perfect and smells tropical.<br /><br />The only drawback I could see is that you need to be careful in using it and have it right over your bottle, the color I'm sure would stain and the liquid comes out pretty forcefully with a squeeze.  Other than that, I was pleased I had a chance to try this and would definitely consider buying this and telling others about it.<br /><br />Great idea in a little package!

review/summary: I want to like it....but,
review/text: I want to like this product, but I can't say I would buy it after trying it.<br /><br />Taste = 5 stars. It does taste GOOD<br /><br />Price = 2 stars. At ~$5 a bottle, it is not a good value.  The recommended few drops just don't add enough flavor.  It takes 2 long quirts to add sufficient flavor.<br /><br />Portability = 2 stars.  While this is a small and easy to pack bottle, it's not really user friendly for travel.  The amount of dye in this product must be quite strong.  If you get the liquid on something porous, watch out - it might as well be food coloring - it stains.  Since it is a liquid, it is much more likely that you will encounter a leak than a small package of drink crystals.  I would never consider keeping this in my purse to flavor water on the go.

review/text: Overall, I liked the Mio product and would recommend it.  I found it easy to use and I liked being able to control how much to add (this is more challenging with the Crystal Light packets I've used before).  And it's not as overly sweet like Crystal Light.  Just a little shot of Mio gave my water a light, refreshing taste that wasn't overpowering.<br /><br />The only negative was that I thought it smelled a little odd in the package, kind of a plastic-smelling/fake peach/chemical smell, but I didn't get that same feeling with it mixed in the water.  It diluted right away in the water and I didn't get that smell in the mixture, but I was somewhat hesitant when I first popped the container open.

review/text: I really like this product - it's nice because with the packaging, you could easily keep it in your purse, car, or gym bag.  I don't like keeping Crystal Light packets in my purse because I have had them open up, then had to get all the powder out.  I also like the fact that you can put as much or as little flavoring in as you want.  Sometimes we have the smaller bottles of water in our house, and then you have to try to estimate half of a packet, and often end up too little or too much - and then you have to keep the halfway full package around until you need it.  With this, you could have any size serving of water and flavor it just as much or little as you like.  I also particularly like this flavor.

review/summary: Loved it!
review/text: MIO makes a wonderfully tasty product that is simple to use and flavor plain water.  Unlike prepackaged granules, this liquid will let you adjust the flavor, so if you don't want to be overpowered, you can just add a few drops.  This is incredibly concentrated so I recommend that you start with one squirt for 8 oz. of water and add more until you figure out exactly how strong you want it to taste.  I also discovered that this is great to add to plain ice tea since it will flavor and sweeten it at the same time.

review/summary: Tasty coffee replacement
review/text: Yeah, mango-peach.  That's as good a description of the taste as any.  All I know for certain is that I like it.  I'd probably like it better if it were more tart, but that's my personal taste and most people like sweeter flavors than I do.  Something really nit-picky is that there is a very slight saccharine after taste.  Very slight.  The color of the undiluted liquid in the little squeeze package is surprisingly red.  I guess this stuff can be used for some tasty zombie make-up too.  I've been using Mio as a coffee replacement.  It has flavor and it's easy to mix to control how strong the taste is.  Actually, easy to mix isn't a good description.  Squirt some Mio into a cup of water, carry it down the hall, and it's mixed just fine when you get where you're going.  The packaging makes it super convenient too.<br /><br />Anyways, my note-to-self is to try the other flavors and hope to find one less sweet.<br /><br />Now, as a drink mix...  Rum or vodka, toss in something sour to get that sweet/sour thing going.  If you want a specific recipe, 1 shot vodka, 2 shots water, 2 dashes lime juice, stir and serve, then add 2 or 3 squirts Mio.  It'll mix itself soon enough and the swirlies are fun.

review/text: Oh goodness this is so delicious if you like these flavors and love kool-aid! I can't believe there are no calories in this and I love the fact it can fit into my purse to take with me when I need a little sweetness in my spring water. I am not one who likes water so this is a great alternative to buying sugar-laden, or nasty sugar-free energy drinks. The flavor is strong or weak depending on how much you use in your water. I like it fairly sweet so 2 semi-long squirts is just right. It's kinda addicting since it reminds me of drinking kool-aid! The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is the price, I can not believe what they charge for this considering it is not an energy, vitamin enhancer, or health increasing kind of drink. Just some yummy flavor to perk up your water now and then : )

review/summary: Everyone in my family likes this stuff
review/text: I selected the Mango Peach to review because I like those flavors, in general.  I used it in a small bottle of Aquafina water.  When I put in one squirt, the water tasted very light, like a flavored water that had just a hint of the flavor. With two squirts, it tasted stronger, like a "fruit tea".<br /><br />I can see that it would be handy to have around, especially if you need a little flavor to encourage you to drink the water.<br /><br />The bottles are small, convenient, seal well (they double click shut) and seem durable. I will be trying other flavors, although this one tastes good.<br /><br />My wife and daughter tried it as well.  My wife liked the flavor.  My daughter said, "Oh, I love that stuff, especially the pomegranate."<br /><br />Mio contains a significant amount of artificial sweetener. The sweeteners used are sucralose and acesulfame potassium.  Note that they are not using aspartame, which is a big advantage to me - I dislike the taste of aspartame.<br /><br />And since the only diet soda you can get at fast food places is flavored with aspartame, I'll be carrying this stuff so that I can get a cup of water or a bottle of water and flavor it myself.

review/summary: An alternative to Crystal Light
review/text: I drink 64-96oz of water per day. I live in Las Vegas and it is necessary because of the sun and heat to get as much hydration as possible. I feel better, eat less, and my skin looks amazing the more water I drink. I always have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NCDE52">NALGENE Tritan 1-Quart Narrow Mouth BPA-Free Water Bottle</a>with me and re-fill it as many times a day as I can swallow. Any product that helps me drink more water, I am interested in trying.<br /><br />Growing up my mom always bought Crystal light for the same purpose of drinking more water. I think this is an updated-version, better-tasting alternative for Crystal light.<br /><br />MIO Mango Peach did not help me drink any more water. I actually found myself avoiding my water bottle because I didn't like the aftertaste of the product. I tried adding less MIO, I tried adding more. Nope. Didn't change. I still didn't grab for more water with MIO. I prefer plain old water, it's easier to drink and more satisfying.<br /><br />With that said, I do like the flavor of this drink. I prefer it as a drink with a meal. It solves the aftertaste issue and with ice it is a pleasant, refreshing drink that does not add calories. I also enjoy adding a splash to plain Greek yogurt and for mixing low(er) calorie mixed-drinks.<br /><br />I cannot see myself purchasing more of this product unless it was on a super sale.

review/text: The Mango Peach Mio is tasty, but for the price I would say it's not worth it. I've seen it for 4-5 dollars at grocery stores and it's even more here at Amazon. Because of Amazon Vine, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I like how you can add as little or as much as you like to your water, instead of it being in little packets like some other brands do. I used about 4 squirts of it in a 16 oz bottle of water. However, I highly doubt you can get 24 servings from this unless they are very watered-down servings. You can taste both mango and the peach in it. Although it tastes good, you can tell it is artificial and it also has a slight aftertaste.<br /><br />Overall, a good product, just not one I would pick up myself if given the chance.

review/summary: Pleasing but artificialish
review/text: I've had several of the MiO flavors and don't have much bad to say about them in general.  The convenience and price makes for a pretty desirable little flavoring product.  A little bit will go a long way, I stretch them much further than the 24 servings they're marked with, and they're reasonably tasty (personal leanings aside).<br /><br />If I had any qualm with them at all it's that they are decidedly 'artificial' in their sweetness and to a lesser extent in their flavors.  The flavoring is supposedly not artificial according to the packaging so perhaps it's more of the sweetener skewing my perception of the flavor. While probably pretty obvious given the nature of the product it should be noted for those that really hate artificial sweeteners or have a particular dislike of a particular artificial tasting flavor (I'm giving you the stinkeye banana Runts and all your ilk).<br /><br />This particular flavor, mango peach, is pretty middle of the road for my tastes.  Definitely mango and peach in flavor but I far prefer the berry pomegranate and fruit punch but that's just me.  If you're bonkers for peach and mango this will probably not disappoint.

review/summary: tastes great, very convenient, and no aspartame!!
review/text: We started using Mio for a couple of reasons.  First, we wanted to cut out excess calories, and second, we wanted to save on the high cost of beverages in restaurants.  Drinks cost about $3-4 each at most casual dining places - that adds $20 to the bill for a family of four.<br /><br />Most flavored water "enhancers" contain aspartame, which I am highly allergic to.  However, Mio is sweetened with sucralose and contains NO ASPARTAME!  Another plus is that Mio is a liquid and not a powder - "add a little or a lot."  My husband prefers his drinks strong, I like mine milder. Mio allows you to choose how much, without worrying about what to do with the excess.  I used to use 4C mixes (which also have no aspartame), but ended up with powder in my purse when I didn't need a whole packet in my drink.  These little bottles are a convenient size that fit easily into a purse or backpack.  My grocery store sells them for about $4 each and they are definitely worth that.<br /><br />We have tried many flavors, and our favorite is the Berry Pomegranate.  The mango peach is a little too sweet for us, but still a good flavor.  My mom usually only drinks lemon flavored iced tea.  The sweet tea flavor is too sweet with no lemon, but she found that the peach tea is a great substitute.  The fruit punch tastes a lot like cherry Cool Aid.  I hope that Mio expands the selection with some new flavors - I'd love a green apple, or lemonade flavor.  Overall, highly recommended!

review/summary: Cool Design & Great Taste
review/text: I really do like this Mango Peach flavor, but after drinking about a cup or two, I could definitely notice an artificial sweetener taste. It's not strong, but it's apparent.<br /><br />It's a really cute design and I like the idea of using this concentrated liquid to make drinks. It's much easier than using powder and it's handy to carry around. Unless I can find one where the artificial sweetener taste isn't there, I most likely won't purchase it again.

review/summary: Convenient, good flavor for water
review/text: This super-concentrated flavoring is so convenient.  One small squeeze into my water glass is plenty for a full 12 ounces of water.  The flavor mixes in instantaneously without any gritty sediment at the bottom of the glass.<br /><br />The flavor is comparable to other water flavorings (like Crystal Light, etc).  It's not exactly natural tasting, but it's not offensive either.  I defnitely taste the mango and the peach.  This is more convenient that the flavored powders for making water more interesting without added calories or caffeine.  A good product!

review/summary: Quick, easy and yummy
review/text: I've been using MIO for several months now and I really like it! When I want a sweeter flavor, I add a dash of Truvia (stevia based sweetener). I love the Mango Peach flavor, but have found most of the others quite good, too. In fact, I'm hoping they start introducing even more flavor choices. The only one I don't like is the Sweet Tea flavor (although the Peach Tea flavor is great).<br />The packaging is well-designed. There's no dripping when you use it, and since the cap snaps down tightly, it doesn't leak if you throw it in your pocket or purse. The bottle is also small enough to get through security at the airport, so I don't have to drink all the sugary and caffeinated drinks they offer on the plane. MIO has become a staple in my house. Price-wise it's a better bargain than the powdered packets.

review/summary: Marvelous, especially with added lemon juice
review/text: I'm a water drinker and I still drink a lot of it straight from the filter. But water can get boring...it is nice to occasionally use an enhancer to add some zest. At various times, I've tried all the commercial products out there. None come close to matching the flavor and convenience of MiO. This is truly an original and outstanding product and it has become a regular part of my food life.<br /><br />I'm an extremely health-conscious eater. I eat a mostly plant-based diet of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. I grow a large portion of my own veggies and buy the rest from local farmers' markets. I try to avoid processed food and cook almost everything from scratch. MiO's ingredient list shows artificial colors, sweeteners, and preservatives...so you might wonder why would I even consider drinking it. Well, I don't use that much and I don't worry about this one little misdemeanor in my pantry. My diet is so healthy in so many other ways that I consider MiO a small indulgence.<br /><br />I've tried to go natural with water enhancers--for example adding pomegranate juice. But truthfully, it is not nearly as flavorful and far from convenient or cost-effective.<br /><br />What I frequently do use to make my MiO drink more healthful is to squeeze a real half a lemon into it. The artificial sugars used in MiO are so strong that they sweeten the lemon, too...and the lemon enhances all the MiO flavors. Lemon is extremely healthful! I could fill up this review page with medical and nutritional information showing the beneficial qualities of lemon juice. I've known about this for a long time but rarely fixed lemonade for myself because I dread using all the real or artificial sugars that it needs to take away the intense sourness. The artificial sugars used in MiO are 600 times sweeter than sugar...they do the trick with a little squirt and nothing more added. So, by using MiO with a half a lemon squeezed into it, I find that I am drinking more liquid per day than I did before I discovered MiO and I am incorporating lemon juice into my daily diet. In the balance, MiO has been a health improvement.<br /><br />Yes, I am aware of the propylene glycol used in this product...but it does not cause me great concern. I am more fearful of coming into contact with bad chemicals from insecticides, common home cleaning products, factory-farmed meat and fish, and the tons of processed foods that I avoid when cooking my own meals from scratch.<br /><br />Taste is a matter of individual preference. I keep all the flavors on hand for variety's sake, but seem to prefer the Berry Pomegranate and the Mango Peach.<br /><br />The MiO bottle is a marvelous invention that should win some kind consumer prize. There is a double-locking lid and little membrane over the opening. The membrane creates a tiny vacuum within the bottle as you squeeze, so you'll never fear dripping the contents on clothes, carpets, or tablecloths as you remove it from your glass. The double-locking lid is so secure that I have no fear carrying a bottle in my purse.<br /><br />My personal wish list for MiO is that they'd remove the artificial coloring. That would make is more healthful and not detract from the flavor in any way.

review/summary: Mix with the plain greek yogurt, So yummy!
review/text: Just came out an idea about mixing Mio with plain yogurt. I added one squeeze into a 2lb of greek yogurt, stirred for a while. Taste just like the fruit flavor yogurt on the market. Has a creamy texture with less carbs and lots of protein. Yummy!<br /><br />It seems a little too sweet for me, so next time I'd add half squeeze and try.<br /><br />As a water flavorant, as far as I tried, I like this flavor and the fruit punch.<br /><br />The sweet tea and peach tea taste far less satisfactory than snapple or lipton brisk (my favorite brand). But after adding some lemon juice, those two taste better.

review/summary: Mango Peach :A Fun, flavorful water enhancer
review/text: I love the Mio line. The portable package is sleek and stylish. The concept behind using as much or as little as you like is wonderful, and for the most part the flavors are awesome.<br /><br />The Mango Peach is my sons favorite. For him this product became a most convenient money saver. During the school year  he would leave the house in the morning and have class until the late evening hours. So he was buying many juice drinks and flavored water drinks at school, and spending a ton of money. With the ability to tuck a bottle of Mio right into his pocket, he was able to bring a water bottle with him and refill it,  add the Mio,and have flavored drinks any time he liked. And he saved a nice amount of money in the bargain.<br /><br />I like the creativity that Mio affords me. I can have it mixed in a little seltzer or Pellegrino for an elegant faux cocktail. Or I can add a few drops to my regular home brewed iced tea for a fruity, tropical twist on an old favorite. It is so nice being able to find multiple uses for a product. I am glad I found this.

review/summary: No thank you....
review/text: I received my bottle of Mio Mango Peach flavoring free from the Amazon Vine Program, in exchange for writing a review.<br /><br />I have a girlfriend who loves Mio and had been encouraging me to try it.  I think the flavor she likes is sweet tea.  So when I saw it offered on the Vine website, I jumped at it.  I drink a gallon of water every day, and sometimes it gets a little monotonous.  What would be nicer than a no-calorie peach/mango flavoring to add to the water, right?<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that I won't be buying Mio in the future.  I had to add 3 or 4 squirts to a glass of water to get any recognizable mango or peach flavoring.  And then it had a very strong saccharine-type aftertaste, and an almost perfume-y smell.  The Mio website claims that it uses sucralose and not saccharine, but whatever it was I didn't like it. Unfortunately, sucralose can also cause diarrhea and gas if enough is ingested.<br /><br />A look at the ingredients on the bottle confirmed my suspicions that this was just another way to ingest unhealthy ingredients masked as "natural".  Propylene glycol - a type of mineral oil, can cause allergic skin reactions.  Yellow #5, Blue #1, and/or Red #40 - these have been linked to ADHD, hyperactivity in children, and lymphoma. Acesulfame Potassium, an artificial sweetener, aggravates hypoglycemia, and has been linked to breast and lung tumors. That's quite a chemical cocktail we're adding to our water!<br /><br />It does come in a cute little bottle that would go well in a purse or backpack.  And if you are counting carbs or calories, or are diabetic, these drops could be a nice way to flavor plain old water.<br /><br />But for me, I'll just continue to add a squirt of lemon or lime juice to my water.  I'm actively trying to eliminate unneeded and harmful chemicals from our diets and Mio won't be something we buy again.

review/summary: A delicious treat
review/text: Well, since some other user decided they'd paste their review on to each flavor allow me to give my short but sweet review:<br /><br />MiO is delicious. I like that I can just put in the tiniest of splashes in my drink and just have a hint of flavor... or splash a lot in and get a real flavorful experience. It's a quick and easy thing to use. It's also fun to watch it splash into the water. I've also found it's good to flavor different types of alcohol.<br /><br />In regards to the criticism by other reviewers for it containing propylene glycol - don't be in a panic like them. propylene glycol is harmless unless ingest massive quantities of it. Using a canard like "it's considered harmful to pets so humans shouldn't ingest it!" is just alarmist behavior. Chocolate is harmful to dogs. Better not eat that then!<br /><br />Lastly, in regards to it having so many "food colorings" - well, if you don't like anything that flavors your water to have anything artificial in it, squeeze a lemon into it. Put a dash of sugar. Or just drink the water plain. You know what you're getting into when you buy this stuff.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is my new favorite drink flavoring. I will be buying from them again and again.

review/summary: Flavor needs improvement, scores points for convenience
review/text: I've tried this flavor of MIO, as well as the strawberry watermelon, and my main reaction to both has been that the flavor is not natural tasting and is far too sweet.  MIO mixed with water creates a flavor not unlike a kids' juice drink, which is not something I prefer.  The taste is sticky sweet and very artificial.  Obviously, something like this is highly subjective, so I'm sure many people love it...it's just not my style.  I will say that MIO is very convenient.  The packaging is small and easy to keep in a desk at work, for instance, or a purse.  Also, there is no need to really stir the liquid, so it has an advantage over Crystal Light or other similar powder products.  Nonetheless, I would need to see major flavor changes before I would buy this again.

review/summary: 2% natural = 98% chemical
review/text: I'll preface this review by saying that as artificially flavored soda products go (most of what you will find on your supermarket shelves fall under that descriptor) this one is not bad... at least in terms of taste.  It is cleaner and truer than most. (Note: my kids liked this flavor better than the peach, but said the peach flavor got a bit lost). But, except for the environmentally-friendly packaging and convenience, that is where the good ends.<br /><br />While the cute branding is what is put forward, this is a heavily marketed chemical stew (to quote the web site from which I retrieved the actual ingredients) from Kraft foods.  In case you are wondering what is in it, here is the list:<br /><br />Water, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Malic Acid, Contains Less than 2% of Natural Flavor, Sucralose and Acesulfame Potassium (Sweeteners), Potassium Citrate, Red 40, Blue 1, Potassium Sorbate (Preservative).<br /><br />I personally go well out of my way to avoid artificial sweetener knowing that most are carcinogens which were given a fast pass because the FDA believes that America needs artificial sweeteners. (I learned this in graduate school from a woman who did independent, unbiased research, and if you knew half of what I know... you would avoid them too!)<br /><br />So we tried these without the understanding that it is an artificially sweetened, as well as artificially flavored beverage.  I am really hoping Amazon will provide full information on the ingredients in their packaged foods soon! (By which I mean simply reporting what is on the label as I have above).<br /><br />I will note as i did in my other review that htis concept is not novel.  My kids have been making "Italian sodas" for years using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWA0A">Torani Vanilla Syrup 750mL</a> syrpus for years.  I do something similar with a bit of juice (but am generally happy enough with fizzy water).  If you like a bit of flavor, I would recommend trying the Italian syrups: much better, much much healthier, or... just add a little juice ;)  (That adds instead of subtracting from the nutritional value).<br /><br />I would give this drink 4 stars for flavor, 5 for convenience, 4 as an overall "green product" from reduced packaging to minimal transportation costs... but a -5 for nutrition.  I am frankly not sure whether this mix of chemicals is better or worse than high fructose corn syrup (my family does not have weight problems) but, personally would rather side-step the entire issue of what is worse for them.  they don't drink Coke, or Pepsi, and I will be limiting this to a very occasional (is it right to call it a treat?)  Frankly I would rather hand them each a sugar cane (which I can get from the local farmers market).  That is a much healthier treat (and I do not have to question whether or not sugar cane qualifies as a treat.)<br /><br />I would recommend instead, trying one of the brands of Italian syrup which Amazon carries, and can personally vouch for many varieties or Torani.  If they ever go to packaging it in luch box squeeze bottles, this product is dead in the water. IMO, that is all it offers.

review/summary: Better Than Kool-Aid
review/text: I added the recommended amount of Mio to a glass, then filled it up with water.  The flavor was pretty strong, but I thought it tasted better than kool-aid.  If you're one of those people that can't stand drinking water because it's tasteless, then this would help you get the water you need without sacrificing taste.  Some people may also want to use less than the recommended amount if they want the taste to be more subtle.  This would make the bottle last longer, too.  The reason I didn't give it five stars is because I think it's kind of pricey for being what it is.  There are 24 servings in each container, but if you drank a few glasses of water a day and used this every time, then that would add up.  Water flavoring shouldn't be expensive.

And the directions are accurate - just add as much or as little to your water as is to your taste.

review/summary: Water flavoring - add a little or a lot to make it "your way"
review/text: My daughter is a ballet major in college and she dances about 6 hours or more each day. The fluid needs are tremendous to keep the joints lubricated and to prevent dehydration, but she doesn't really like to drink plain, boring bottled water. I got her this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V9I78I">MiO Liquid Water Enhancer, Mango Peach 1.62 fl oz (48 ml)</a> to try so she might be encouraged to get the fluids she needs.<br /><br />She added one squirt to her water as the directions indicated and found that the flavor was not quite as strong as she had hoped so had to add more to really get a good mango peach taste. Perhaps other flavors are stronger? At around $6.00 for a small container, it can get expensive since it really doesn't give enough flavoring to make the 24 8-ounce drinks as it advertises on the product label. It is a nice size, however, to carry in a purse or bag so that you can always have it with you. This water enhancer provides no vitamins so it is not nutritive as some other products are. It adds no calories to the water -- which is an important consideration for many.<br /><br />It's good enough that I'd like to try more flavors, but the price is the main drawback since a person will actually likely need to add more drops if they want a strong taste of the flavoring.

After receiving the MIO Mango Peach, and the Peach Tea from Amazon Vine I can testify that these are actually wonderful.  The ease of use and taste is excellent.  We go through lots and lots of drink products and, in general, they take up enormous amounts of shelf space when we buy them in bulk to save money during sales.<br /><br />I haven't calculated the cost effectiveness of MIO yet, but I could store several bottles of this in very little space.  Normally we buy Arizona Tea either in the cans or the gallon jugs, and using MIO would be a great alternative.<br /><br />MIO will now be a favorite at our house along with Crystal Light Lemonade.

review/text: Immediately upon adding this product to your water, your water turns red. Fairly bright red, even with just a little bit of the product. Next, your nose is greeted with a slightly artificial, slightly sweet, vaguely peach scent. Finally, upon taking a sip, your taste buds are met with... kind of nothing. A slight bit of a hint of flavor, but very very fake and a little bit chemical-ly. That was my review.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this product. I don't like drinking water, and anything that can turn water palatable for me is excellent. BUT, I didn't like it. It basically takes perfectly good water and turns it into a glass of chemicals. The one good thing is that you can add as much or as little as you want (for a very red, very fake flavor, or for a very pink, very watered down flavor - with no in between that I can find).<br /><br />All that said, I quickly gave the MIO to my roommate and he loved it. Absolutely loved it. I think he had four glasses of water this evening alone, and he commented that the bottle wasn't going to last the week. So I guess it's not for everyone, but it is for some people!

review/summary: Surprisingly tasty
review/text: I drink a lot of water.  In the summer I drink a lot of fizzy water -- I even have my own water fizzer -- and sometimes I want it to have some flavor.  Not sugar, I don't want soda, just a little something to break up the monotony of water, water and water, with water on the side.<br /><br />I've tried a couple of flavoring products and remained unimpressed, but I have to say that MiO surprised me.  The flavor is really clean and natural, and the sweetness, though from artificial sources, (Sucralose) isn't off-putting.  I'd prefer it unsweetened but it's not horrible; I'm fine with it.<br /><br />I've tried it in water and in hot and cold tea, and in each case, MiO enhanced the beverage.  It's easy to use and each bottle looks to have a fairly generous amount of flavoring in it. (At least it does for me; I use one squirt for anything up to a liter of liquid.<br /><br />At this price point, MiO is a very good alternative to soda, in my opinion.  There are a lot of different flavors, so if mango-peach doesn't suit, you have other choices.  I liked this one so much I'm tempted to try some of the others.  How much more of a recommendation could you ask for?

review/text: Just a little squeeze brought a flavor splash in a 16 ounce bottle of water. It was just enough peach mango flavor to perk me up. Considering how large the container is, I know that I can get more than 24 servings from it. I think that is a conservative estimate.<br /><br />I am thinking how great this would be for a car trip. Take several flavors and you can skip the drink machine, I really like that there are no calories. It is in a sturdy plastic bottle that when you snap it shut will not come open by itself. So, I could put it in my purse and carry it with me. Actually, the package is kind of cute, it is shaped like a drop of water when you turn it upside down to get the splash.<br /><br />I have been buying the powdered tubes at the store but they can be messy when you open them.

review/summary: Fun to Squirt!
review/text: So I have to confess - I absolutely LOVE these things.  I love almost all the flavors, and this Mango Peach is at the top of my list, next to Strawberry Watermelon.  I love that I can put in as little or as much as I want into my reusable water bottle and I'm off!  I usually put 2 short squirts into my 64oz Nalgene, and I feel that is plenty for me.  At that rate, it usually last a few weeks for me.  Some may want it stronger, for me, it's quite enough sweetness.  I don't get headaches from this like I do from Crystal Light, so the fake sugar is better for me.  It's also recyclable in my community.  My only hope is that this never gets discontinued - I can't go back to the powder stuff!!!!

review/summary: It's OK but I think I like my water un-enhanced.
review/text: I ordered this from the Vine selections just out of curiosity since I have nothing against the taste (or lack thereof) of plain old water and if I want something else it'll be juice (the real thing from real fruit) or tea.  I do concede that this stuff tastes like peach; no false advertising there.  The mango flavor is overwhelmed, however, by the peach and doesn't come through very well to my tastebuds.  That's OK.  Peach is nice.  I add it to coconut water and it makes for a pleasant drink.<br /><br />If I were to ever voluntarily buy this, I would prefer no sweetener added so that I would have control over the level of sweetness to my drink.  This stuff is really too sweet for me.  When I reduce the amount of Mio enhancer to reduce the sweetness, that also reduces the fruit flavor too much.  Another thing I would prefer is no artificial coloring.  It makes for an unappealing, unnatural look to the drink.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I doubt I'll look for more Mio liquid water enhancer unless I can find some that is unsweetened and has no artificial coloring.

review/summary: Mango Peach: Taste Treat
review/text: Mangos are a favorite fruit of mine and I find peaches to be delightful whether raw or cooked. Never having had them in combination left me a bit aprehensive when I received the Mio. I opened an eight ounce jar of bottled water and squeezed in a shot of Mio. The result was a bottle of water with a barely distinguishable flavor. I gave it a second shot and the taste was just right. There is no one formula that fits all. It depends on individual taste and how hard you squeeze the Mio bottle and the length of the squeeze. With a little fine tuning you can achieve a welcome diversion from plain water. This is a tiny bottle but it can bring a big dose of enjoyment.

review/summary: Took 5 shots for good flavor.
review/text: I absolutely love peach tea. I was happy to try Mio Liquid Peach Tea and Mio Peach/Mango Tea to see if it would be better than real peach tea or other peach tea brands. The idea is simple, make a syrup to add to your glass for some delicious tea wherever you are. No messy packets to mess with; No clouds of powder to smell. However, getting it to the right flavor took a lot of shots. The directions say one shot per each 8oz of water. I filled two glasses with 8oz of water. This review deals only with the peach/mango.<br />On the first shot, you couldn't taste anything other than water though the glass did have a tint to it. The second shot still gave no hint of a flavor. The third shot definitely had flavor, but not identifiable as peach or mango. The fourth shot was definitely better and the fifth finally had a nice taste to it. However, 5 shots into what ended up as a 6oz glass of water seemed a bit much. With each pack having 24 shots (one shot per 8oz serving as recommended on the directions), and one glass taking 5 shots to taste good - you are lucky to get 4 glasses of tea out of one Mio Liquid 1.62oz container. Granted tastes differ and you might get by with less shots. I also used tap water instead of bottled water to test it out to get an exact 8oz measurement of water.

Recently I added a Strawberry Watermelon to the mix and have found it is also good, especially in water.  The Mango Peach is a favorite mixed with Turkey Hill Green Tea and is a daily drink for me (ie. why I bought 4 at a time).<br />Now I must have my daily fix or I feel like the day is not complete.

review/text: I had bought this at a local store and tried it it out. This is my review.<br /><br />For a small bottle (less than 2 oz)if you use it right this can actually last a long time. Just a little bit of it in a water bottle goes a long way. But be careful not to press on it to much or to much will come out and it will be grossly sweet.. Seriously just barely pinch it and it will really be enough to flavor the water...<br /><br />The only other negative is the additives in it... They are not very good for you...But then again what diet sweetener really is?<br /><br />But other than that it is not bad!

review/summary: Reasonable taste if it keeps you away from sugary drinks
review/text: This MIO Mango Peach is a reasonable alternative to sugary drinks. If it keeps one away from sugary drinks, it does its job. It is not going to win a taste contest against fresh fruit or fresh fruit juice but it has zero calories. I use one squirt each time, on cups 12 to 20 ounces of water. The squirt has enough power that it can almost reach towards the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />In my case, I occasionally use it to give the water a little flavor, so it's not just plain old water, and keeps me away from the sugary drinks. Squirting this is faster than brewing tea and icing it or slicing lemons and limes, although the latter are probably healthier choices :)

review/summary: Serving Size = 1/2 tsp.
review/text: I usually drink coffee, ice tea or plain water. Once in a while I use  individual tubes of no calorie flavors. I find Crystal Light is usually too sweet for me & prefer the store brands.  MIO isn't nearly as sweet as Crystal Light, but I'm not crazy about this flavor. I used two squirts in a 10 oz. bottle of water, then shake to mix. It's hard for me to judge how much I'm squirting into the water. A serving size is 1/2 tsp. so you might want to measure your squirts to get an idea of how much you're using. Of course, the sweetness & strength of flavor will be up to you..just use more or less squirts.<br /><br />When I mix MIO Mango Peach into a glass of water, I don't like the smell. I prefer to mix it into bottled water, the bottle opening prevents the smell from getting to my nose.<br /><br />Pros<br />Not as sweet as Crystal Light<br />0 Calories<br />Can use more or less according to your taste preference<br />Convenient<br /><br />In Between<br />The flavor of MIO Mango Peach is so, so...taste improves when it's cold<br /><br />Cons<br />It's hard to get the flavor consistent<br />I don't like the smell of MIO Mango Peach (it's better to use this in a bottle, not a glass or cup, etc.)

Additionally being able to choose how much or how little flavor you add is nice too; me I found that with most of the flavors I like 2-3 quick squirts in my water bottle which holds 24 ounces. Mango Peach is by far my favorite, with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY">MIO Sweet Tea</a> as a close second. For some the taste may be unappetizing and I admit at first I wasn't sure I liked it, but it grew on me and now I use MIO on an almost daily basis.

review/summary: Great tasting diet tea... sometimes
review/text: When mixed perfectly, the MIO Mango Peach iced tea tastes like a diet version of Chili's Mango iced tea which I am a big fan of.<br /><br />The problem is that it is next to impossible to get a consistent strength. I try for 2 medium squirts for the right flavor, but there is no practical way to measure how much mix you are putting in your glass. It squirts out too hard to measure with a measuring spoon. So, some days it is too strong, and I end up dumping the whole thing. Other days, it starts too weak. Of course, adding more makes it too strong. Like Goldilocks, some days, it ends up just right, and it tastes great.<br /><br />The bottle says that it has 24 servings. I haven't been counting, but it seems like a lot more than 24.

review/summary: Not So Peachy
review/text: Probably the best thing about MIO is its portability and sharability. The problem is that the flavor  may not be outstanding enough for anyone to want to share.<br /><br />I don't particularly care for the phony label "Water Enhancer". Adding an artificial color, artificial sweetener, and an unnatural taste that only approximates the flavor created in nature does not seem like an enhancement to me.<br /><br />The MIO is easy to use - flip open the cap, squeeze some MIO into the water for an explosion of color, taste, squeeze again, taste, squeeze again if necessary, continue squeezing and tasting until satisfied, and then clip the lid shut.<br /><br />The inexact nature of the squeeze is a sticking point for me because it's almost impossible to duplicate the exact amount squeezed each time. One could measure half a teaspoon of liquid first but that defeats the design of the product.<br /><br /> I've only tried the Mango/Peach. It has great color but only average taste that tastes slightly artificial. There is a chalky aftertaste after each swallow, but not an obtrusive one.  I much prefer Crystal Light for taste though I also find it tedious to mix just the right amount of product into the water with the CL.<br /><br />Anyone so inclined might find it easy to shoplift such a small handful of a container, but the taste of the product might preclude such shenanigans.

review/summary: Convenient for Flavor
review/text: I took my Mio to work to flavor up water at lunchtime. I try to drink 6-8 cups of water while at work, and sometimes I get real tired of plain ol' water. Yay for Mio!<br /><br />It's much more convenient than keeping a jug of juice in the work fridge -- the Mio does not need to be refrigerated, and is small enough I could take it with me on the go to restaurants and forgo the overpriced soda.<br /><br />The Mio `liquid water enhancer' (honest advertising, there) is not really tasty, but if you want a little more flavor than water, it works. The flavor is no worse than most, say, energy drinks, or zip-fizz like concoctions.<br />I found the Mango Peach to be decent. The flavor is pleasant enough, not strongly mango or peach, very sweet. It takes a bit more of the Mango Peach to flavor a whole glass than it does the Berry kind, I think, but I do like the Mango flavor better.<br /><br />The bottle design is simple. Instructions on the side tell you to open, squirt, enjoy (I paraphrase). I think it would be better in a bottle of water, if you were carrying it around (on a trip, maybe? This is getting better and better.), thus you could shake it, as with a cup of water I found the flavor to condense a bit at the bottom.<br /><br />The packaging is secure enough I don't think it would open by accident, or leak, should I be carrying it in my purse.<br /><br />I would make a couple comments on the labeling. One, and this is just funny: under the flavor it explains that it is Mango peach `Natural flavor with other natural flavor'. Ok. Two, the Nutrition Facts are listed for 1 serving -- so 1/24 of the bottle. This makes a lot of sense, except that then all the values are 0. That only tells me there is perhaps something of sugar and protein in there but not significant enough to be 1% -- or the values are just 0. I don't pretend to understand Nutrition labeling.<br /><br />Know that this flavor-enhancer is not a significant source of things like calcium, iron, fiber, etc. (They're missing the part about it not containing peanuts.)<br /><br />Ingredients include malice acid, propylene glycol, citric acid, less than 2% of natural flavor (...ok), potassium citrate, sweeteners, coloring, and preservatives.<br /><br />It contains 0% juice, does not need to be refrigerated, but should be used within a month of opening.<br /><br />Size effective, yes -- Mio is awesome. Price effective, well, that depends on what you are doing and what you want.

The third listed ingredient is propylene glycol, which is the main ingredient in most antifreeze and gel deodorant sticks. Apart from the inventive concept of delivering it in concentrated form in a squeeze bottle, it is nothing more than re-marketing of sugar-free Kool-Aid for adults.

review/summary: Cheaper to Buy Flavored Water
review/text: The bottle says to use one squeeze per bottle of water. This gives you about 24 uses per MIO bottle.  This comes out to twenty-five cents per $6 MIO. In most cases a bottle of flavored water isn't more than twenty to thirty cents more than a bottle of plain water.  So you don't really gain anything unless you use it to flavor tap water.  That would be fine if you don't mind the same flavor each time.<br /><br />As to the flavor, Mango Peach would not be my choice but it tasted fine and had just a little aftertaste.  But this might have been because I squeezed too hard on the bottle.  Of course if you use less it just flavors the water a little and has no aftertaste at all.  For me I think I'll just drink my water straight or with a squeeze of 'Real Lemon'.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz

I highly recommend you start out with only a drop or two, until you reach your desired level of flavor. I like MIO Mango Peach, but I only recommend it if you're a fan of fruity diet drinks. If you're more of a juice drinker, and/or someone that does not like diet soft drinks, you may want to look elsewhere.

review/summary: Artificial acid-like taste
review/text: MIO Mango Peach comes in a handy dental-floss looking bottle, and has 24 servings in a bottle. Basically you squirt some in plain water, and this enhances the water with a semi-artificial peach/mango taste. It also seems to contain food-color, since it tints the water a light peach color.<br /><br />I was curious to try Mango Peach Mio, but I confess it really isn't something I care to repeat. The drink does enhance the water with a semi-fake artificial peach taste, but I confess I prefer my water straight and without the extra fake-flavoring and acid.While the taste was appealing, I don't need the extra chemicals or food dye in my diet, and as the main ingredients are: water and malic acid and contains zero fruit juice, you aren't really getting anything healthy here. I also found the ingredients in this drink mix irritating to my bladder, so those with painful bladder syndrome should be aware this drink contains acid.<br /><br />If you like artificial drinks of the crystal light variety, this might appeal to you.  For me, while the idea was innovative, I would like it to be more healthy to consume and without the food dye and acidity.

review/text: This is the second flavor of MIO that I've tried. The Peach Tea was good but I think the mango Peach is even better. It tastes like Peach with a slight taste of Mango. There is no need for additional sweetening. It claims that that each glass should get half a teaspoon mixed in but I found that to be too weak. I'll not be getting 24 servings from the container... maybe half that. For the home I see no use for this product but on the road or at work I can see where this would come in very handy. I'll be buying more of this product especially for backpacking. Good for the workplace or a roadtrip too.

When I added it to my filtered water (filtered with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00407ZHSO">3M Filtrete Water Station</a> it had the thirst-quenching qualities of plain water, and it tasted lightly of real mango and peach.  It didn't taste artificial, and it wasn't too sweet unless I accidentally added too much MIO to my water.  When that happens, I merely add a bit more water.  Because of the Sucralose, I won't buy this often, but I will definitely buy it occasionally.<br /><br />Amazon doesn't list the ingredients.  Here they are:  Water, Malic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Contains less than 22% of Flavor(s) Natural, Sucralose and Acesulfame Potassium Sweetener, Potassium Citrate, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40, Potassium Sorbate Preservative.  Definitely not a health drink, but tasty enough that I don't care.

review/summary: Tastes good...easy to use
review/text: This is a pretty simple complement to water - squirt it in a glass, and it will add some decent flavor to 'normal' water. Quick and easy, and a good product to carry around if you're on the go. If you had it at a restuarant, you could probably do fine with just the water, and the flavoring the MIO provides.<br /><br />I think the 24 drinks per container is a little optimistic. It takes a decent amount to get strong flavor, so if you need your water sweeter, you'll probably go through the containers more quickly than the packaging's estimate. But, if you just need a little flavor, you'd be fine. It's also not instant flavor - you do have to stir it, or give it a minute to settle in.<br /><br />The flavor itself is okay. It does get sweet at the higher doses, but not overwhelmingly. There is no medicine-y taste, like you'd get with some of the cheaper powder drinks. Like another reviewer noted, it's "adult Kool-Aid."

review/summary: Adult Kool Aid
review/text: This is adult Kool Aid, sans the sugar. But the concept of easily controlling the level of flavor is interesting.<br /><br />The mango peach is okay. The flavor doesn't stand out - it's orange and sweet. I think it needs a little more tart.<br /><br />I wish there was a way to turn up the flavor and turn down the sweetness.

review/text: MIO Mango Peach is pretty good, and, unlike other flavors, it's good mixed with water. I was a little surprised, however, at the strong coloring; I don't object to coloring for its own sake, but the redness made the kids ask questions. This is something I'll consider buying again, and I really like the bottles. They're a good size for pocket or purse, and they don't seem to leak or drip.

review/summary: Really great - though it definitely won't make 24 drinks
review/text: The MIO Liquid flavors are really, really good. In fact, they are vastly more flavorful than the many powdered water additives that I have tried. I loved the Mango Peach and tried a coworker's Pomegranate, and fully intend to explore other flavors in the future. But it is simply hogwash that these make 24 drinks. They will if you only want mildly flavored water, but for a fuller flavor you will only be able to make perhaps 16 drinks. This is still a good price for such a convenient way of making something to drink, but perhaps some will feel misled.<br /><br />What I like about this in addition to its taste is that it makes me drink more water. I'm a coke addict. The brown, sugary cola kind. I drink far more cokes than are good for me and they undoubtedly lead to some mild dehydration. If for no other reason than that, I plan on trying out all of the MIO flavors.

review/text: I love the MIO products.  They are cute, portable, and really tasty.  The Mango/Peach isn't my favorite flavor, but it's still pretty tasty.  My favorite is the Berry Pomegranate, it's so good!  The absolute best thing about MIO is that it makes me drink a lot more water.  I look forward to my water drinking when it used to be almost a chore.  These little containers hold a lot too!  You'll be happy with this purchase.

review/summary: MIO Excited To Try - Disappointed In Taste...
review/text: I had wanted to try MIO ever since it came out in the Spring of 2011.  Priced it and always passed it up since I found it nowhere on sale and/or no coupons were available. Howsomever, Amazon sent me a sample through the Vine Program so that I could review the product.  I found the taste and aftertaste to be more than a little offputting.  I love mango and I love peach but I tasted no "tea" flavoring in this product.  MIO is such a handy product but if I were the company, I would go back to the drawing board and re-release MIO with hopefully a better taste and outcome. I would not recommend this product since it misses the mark on so many different levels.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: I was excited to try this "water enhancer" with the mango peach flavor, as I love mango flavored anything (well almost).  I squirted this Mio Liquid into a glass of cold water and was hoping for the best.  It just tasted like a melted popsicle or similar.  I thought the squirts would be more measured, but they are not, so I don't know how you can know if you got enough flavoring or not.  I squirted a few more squirts into my glass, hoping that I didn't put enough in.  With more flavoring, it wasn't any better.<br /><br />I don't have any, but I wondered if using this stuff in sparkling water would work better.  This flavoring in regular drinking water just doesn't work for me.  I would rather drink plain water than this.  Another scenario that this may or may not work in is the water at Disney World.  The water there tastes like sulfur, and it is something awful.  Don't know if this would mask that taste or not.

review/text: In a nutshell: MIO Mango Peach tastes like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5EWI">Crystal Light On The Go Metabolism Plus Green Tea Peach Mango</a> without the little green flecks (or pro-ported benefits of green tea). And somehow, MIO has managed to turn water in to a drink that doesn't make me less thirsty. It's kind of amazing that way.<br /><br />If you enjoy fruity drinks with a strong "diet" aftertaste, you're going to love MIO.

review/text: Yikes.  I feel like the odd woman out, but I really did not like the peach mio.  I like the idea of adding as much of it (or as little as I want).  I don't like my flavored water to be too overwhelmingly flavored if that makes sense.  However, the little I used it made it taste like a watered down glass of Koolaid to me.  I tried it again and used more and it still tasted like a watered down drink, but with a bite on the end that was not mango peach flavored.  It was just not very good which is a disappointment.  This little container would have been perfect on the go.

review/summary: MIO Mango Peach
review/text: Wow, I have to say, I did not enjoy this drink additive at all.  I've tried several other brands, some I liked some I didn't, but this was my first opportunity to enjoy a MIO, and it didn't speak well for the brand.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this product would probably be the taste.  It's supposed to be mango peach and honestly it didn't taste like either of those things.  The suggested serving is 1 squeeze per 8oz serving so I tried that at first in my water bottle.  It tasted like extremely watered down indeterminate flavored gatorade.  Not so good.  So the next time I amped it up and did 3-4 squeezes into my water bottle.  This time the flavor was stronger but it still didn't taste a thing like mango or peach and actually I felt like I was drinking that sugar water they place in hummingbird feeders.  The color was about the same too come to think of it.  It was kind of disappointing not only for the taste, but for the fact that I needed to use 3x the amount suggested to actually taste anything.  This means there probably won't be the 24 servings it says it has.  Not that I'll probably finish it.<br /><br />The only thing this had going for it was that the ingredients were somewhat natural.  But then they through a bunch of red and yellow dyes to bring that down.  It also has an attractive bottle that it comes in, easy to tote around.  But that only goes so far.  This product is supposed to flavor water and since it fails in that area I can't really recommend it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011

review/summary: Not mango or peach or anything recognizable as such
review/text: I tried this in water, and it took a lot more than I expected to be able to get a strong taste. I am accustomed to Crystal Light and was a little surprised that this MIO took so many drops to get the strong taste I wanted. But the more I put in, the sweeter the water became; it seemed to get sweeter a lot faster than the mango taste amplified. I just couldn't drink it.<br /><br />Next I thought maybe it would brighten up my Diet Sprite; well it did make it pretty! But the MIO seemed to fight with the sweetener in the Diet Sprite in a way that created a funky chemical off-tasting residue in my mouth. So dumped that.<br /><br />One last attempt to redeem the MIO: iced tea! How can you mess that up? Easily! Add some MIO! The tea went from delicious, to tasting like someone had dropped perfume into it. I can't even begin to describe what happened when my tea and the MIO mixed; every sip not only smelled like my bath lotion, but it also faintly tasted like maybe the lotion had been dumped into my tea. Just an unpleasant, shudder-giving experience. Dumped that glass.<br /><br />No matter what I mixed the MIO into, it also left a slimy feeling in my mouth, kind of like snails had been living in there awhile.<br />Not a purchase or even a recommendation for me.

Hmmmmmmm.<br />MIO is a great product to carry around in your pocket for every time you buy a bottled water. OPen you water , drink some straight out of the bottle , to make room for the MIO , squirt in how much flavor you want, shake and enjoy.<br />Available in many flavors , the portability of this is the true selling point. Flavor in your pocket.And darn great tasting too !
