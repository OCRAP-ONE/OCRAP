review/summary: Great BBQ, poor Amazon packaging
review/text: BBQ sauce is the best hands down next to Watkins BBQ concentrate which isn't available anymore. This was available in Walmart recently in 18 & 64 oz bottles, but they have been changing their inventory a lot recently and going more store brand. Fairly priced, but the 6 bottles are in a tightly fitting box inside a sealed plastic bag. The corners of the bottle near the neck touch each other bottle and due to the shipping they can press against each other and 2 of my bottles cracked. There was BBQ everywhere. Amazon did refund my purchase after I submitted photo feedback. I wish the process was a little more streamlined.

review/summary: Cheap Great tasting BBQ Sauce
review/text: I grew up with Cattlemen's then I moved to the other side of the USA.  I later discovered Cattlemen's BBQ Sauce at Walmart and started using it, then Walmart discontinued it my area and I could not get it anywhere in this state, so I went to Amazon. I ordered 2 cases of 6 Plastic bottles. I just got my shippment from Amazon and 2 of the bottle are damaged ( meaning there is BBQ sauce inside the box )there wasn't any packaging inside the box, the bottles were wrapped in bundles of 6 and the bundles were loose in the box.From what I read about returns on products like this one, you cann't return them. Would I order a product like this from AMAZON again,NO. Don't get me wrong I still love Cattlemen's BQQ Sauce, I'll try getting it from some one else.

review/summary: My dogs absolutely love them
review/text: I had always given rawhide chews and didn't really have any problems with them. I picked these up by mistake thinking they were dingo's but when I gave them to my dogs, they were trying to take each other's from them, that's how much they liked them. There have been no stomach problems. I noticed with rawhide, they would cough a lot as if it was stuck in their throat. I quit giving them pig ears for the very same reason. These do not make them cough at all.

review/summary: My dogs dream of these bones!
review/text: I have been giving these bones to my dogs for over two years now and they LOVE them!  Every night just before bed time they each get a bone and they go crazy when they see my take them out.  The mini size is good for small dogs, my female dog is 9 pounds and does not have all her teeth (they never fully came in)but has no problems with eating this treat.  I like that these bones do not leave any residue on the couch or bed and that they don't get slimey like raw hides.  This is a great treat and unlike the 1 star poster, I don't care that they come from China.  It is hard to find chews that will not make my dogs choke, are a small size, do not leave residue, and that they love to eat.  I have found all of that with these chews and highly recommend them!

review/summary: Pretty good product
review/text: Both of my dogs really enjoyed this rawhide alternative bone. My dogs have been eating real rawhide for several years, with seemingly no issues. Recently, one of my dogs had a terrifying near-death experience; choking on a rawhide. After doing some research, I learned that this isn't an uncommon situation, and that rawhides are a known choking hazard. After the incident, I quickly researched different rawhide alternative bones, and theses ones were one of the first we have tried. They have more of a leathery texture, softer and more flexible than a rawhide. However, they are not soft treats that can be chewed up quickly, it still took my dogs some time to eat them, and enjoying them for about 10 minutes. One thing that I really liked about these bones is that they don't get stringy, slimy, and sticky like rawhides do. They get softer with chewing, and then brake off into smaller pieces, unlike rawhides that won't brake off, making the dream bones less of a choking hazard. They only reason I gave them a 4 star rating and not a 5 star rating is because the first ingredient (the most prevalent) is corn. Corn isn't the greatest thing for pets to consume because its not easy to digest. I avoid corn in pet food at all costs, but because this is a treat- and not a main food staple, I think it is okay. I do recommend these- especially over regular rawhides. I would recommend the dental version more as those ones smell really good and contain parsley and chlorophyl and other good smelling ingredients that aren't present in the chicken flavor.

review/summary: My Dog LOVES These Chews!!!
review/text: Our dog is a 12 year-old poodle.  She was having a lot of issues with rawhide chews and other treats--like throwing up all the time.  She absolutely loves these chews, and they don't bother her stomach.  Every evening she whines to let us know that it is time for her treat-it's a regular ritual with her.  She gets so excited and  will go through all of her tricks for just half of one of these mini chews.  We have been giving her these chews for more than a year and are really glad we found this product on Amazon.

review/summary: Great so far!
review/text: Great product so far! We've only been using these for about a month, but I can tell you this - our 11 year old dog who has never handled rawhide well and who can no longer chew most other dental chews loves these.  Furthermore, they are a great chew for our 9 week old Lab. Both dogs are handling them without any digestive issues. One last thing - while you should absolutely be cautious of what your pet eats, giving these a poor rating based solely on where they are from seems uninformed and a bit prejudicial to me (unless there are some facts out there that haven't been shared yet).  If things change and I find these to cause any issues with my pups, be sure that I will update this post.  Until then, if you see no updates, all is well!!

review/summary: Excellent alternative to rawhide.
review/text: I've been giving these bones to my 3 dogs for well over 1 year and had never had any problems. It surprised me to see that the other review had such negative comments about this product but never really stated anything about actually giving it to the dogs and seeing the results. Anyhow, I love these. One of my chihuahuas kept throwing up with other bones and these are literally the only ones I can give her without having accidents all over my house. They do have a different texture to them but again, I've never had any incidents with them so I will keep buying it. Too bad they do not have these in the Amazon recurring subscriptions :-(

Does not look like something they should be ingesting. Anyway, I will never buy these again. Zero stars!

I can't speak for the taste since I don't eat them :-) but my 2 dogs seem to look forward to these little treats.  We have to watch their weight and these are the perfect size and don't seem to be adding the pounds.  As long as they get some little something they are happy.  We have to watch what we give our cockerpoo as she has a sensitive stomach but so far these don't seem to be upsetting her.

review/summary: totally misleading
review/text: I got 3 boxes with a total of 12 pouches.  Makes me question ordering from amazon.  I was sent an email on special sales, saying this was slashed in price from $70 to $15.87 a savings of 77%, for a pack of 12.  I ordered the apple mashers once when they were on a special, so I thought this was the same special.  Who would order 3 boxes for $15.89 when they could get 4 boxes for less.  Before, a a pack of 12 was 12 boxes with 4 mashers in each.  Other product from revolution listed as pack of 12 are also 12 boxes with 4 in each box<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OCYUEQ">Revolution Foods Organic Mashups, Tropical, 3.17-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a>.  Why would this one be any different?  Of course, these are nonreturnable.  I am going to assume that since they sold out, that there are many others who were duped and are going to be just as stumped when they get 3 packs, not 12.  I would like to complain to amazon, but looked everywhere and can't even find a contact us.  If the original price had been $70, they would have been around $23 a box, almost $6 a tube.  They are definitely lacking in specifics in the description area.

review/text: Wow! A can of these cost me over five dollars at the store, but I had to try them out.  What you get here is a can of sardines that are so slim that it takes two layers of them to fill the can.  I suppose that means a greater skin-to-meat ratio and even more flavor since the flavor of a sardine tends to be in the skin.<br /><br />Are two layers better than one?  Maybe slightly.  You get most of the small sardine in olive oil flavor with the one layer variety, but it you want to reach for that next level in sardine delicacy and flavor, here they are!

review/text: This offer is impossible to pass up. Dollar for dollar it is the one to act on.  As for Season's sardines; not all sardine brands are created equal.  Overall, the Season brand brislings are better in just about every respect.  They have a higher consistency of quality and taste good.  If you are new to sardines it can be daunting to find the right ones.  Generally, you will only want to focus on the "Brislings" because of their smaller size and subsequent better taste.<br /><br />Verdict: eat this<br /><br />PS.

review/summary: One of the 3 best sardines !
review/text: Its hard to say any product is the 'best' without valid comparison.<br />Apples are apples - and brisling sardines are the best ! no question.<br /><br />Seasons 2-layer packed in olive oil are in my top 3 sardines. I eat<br />one can ever single day - and no I never tire of them. I see a lot of chatter<br />about sardines in olive oil vs. water. To me, olive oil is the way to go. The ones<br />in water are great - but remember these little guys have all the good fats so the<br />calorie savings over water and oil (assuming you pour off oil and feed the cat/dog) is<br />minimal. Oil packed taste better but have I also like the water types.<br /><br />My top 3 (all brisling) ...<br />- Seasons 2 layer in olive oil<br />- King Oscar Tiny tots in olive oil<br />- Crown Prince 2 layer in olive oil<br /><br />I have tried them all - the spring water brislings are great, as are the mustard ones.<br />You can always add your favorite condiment - mustard, hot sauce, vinegar, lemon.<br />The olive oil 2 layer ones are the best tasting, most versatile I have had.<br /><br />I do not want to pan the single layer brisling varieties - they are just a bit bigger but<br />still very tasty. In general - smaller is better ... and more expensive.<br /><br />On the cost side amazon holds its own. In most major markets in the US - they don't carry the<br />brisling sardines, and if they do they are $3 plus a can. My Walmart here in cali sometimes has<br />2 of my 3 favorites (not seasons variety). When available - walmart charges about $2.60 a can.<br />If you can get any of these varieties at 2.5 - 3.0 bucks a can stock up. They are not always<br />available.<br /><br />Enjoy - I love sardines and they have replaced my old reliable tuna. Let the tuna stock come back !<br />Sardines are ...<br />1. cheap<br />2. healthy<br />3. tasty<br />4. sustainable<br /><br />eat well - and look to the future

review/text: The high quality of these sardines has remained through the years.  I've tried sardines<br />in other sauces and olive oil remains my favorite.  Excellent on toast with lettuce and<br />tomatoes.  Use as much or as little of the olive oil as you wish.  I prefer draining<br />them before eating.

review/text: These are the best sardines I have ever had. I have had many different brands and sauces and these are far and away the best. They are quite small and should be low on the food chain which means less accumulated mercury if you are worried about that sort of thing. Worth a try if you are into eating for health.

review/summary: Excellent Alternative to Rawhide
review/text: I've been giving these bones to my 3 dogs for well over 1 year and had never had any problems. It surprised me to see that the other review had such negative comments about this product but never really stated anything about actually giving it to the dogs and seeing the results. Anyhow, I love these. One of my chihuahuas kept throwing up with other bones and these are literally the only ones I can give her without having accidents all over my house. They do have a different texture to them but again, I've never had any incidents with them so I will keep buying it. Too bad they do not have these in the Amazon recurring subscriptions :-(

review/summary: Great so far!
review/text: We've used these with two dogs (an 11 year old and a 9 week old) and have had absolutely no issues so far. In fact, these are the first dental chews that our 11 year old has ever been able to handle without issue. No digestive issues and no ill health effect; only happy pups whose eyes light up when we open the package.  They are also the perfect size for our pups to finish in one sitting; a little tasty distraction without having an all day chewing event.<br /><br />Now, I had no intention on posting a review for this product. However, after I saw such a poor rating on these chews that we had been using for our pups, I was quite concerned.  When I saw that the poor rating came from someone who had used the product only once (that I can tell) and negated it based not on fact or ill effects to their animals but solely on where the product was manufactured, I decided to post a counter review from someone who had actually used - and is still currently using - the product. Rest assured that if these PROVE to be a detriment to our pups (based on either factual evidence or research that I find), I will post an update.  If you don't see any updates, then all is still going great on this end, and I am a very satisfied customer.

review/summary: My doggy LOVES these!!!
review/text: We rescued a dog in May and have been trying to find a treat for her that she will eat and enjoy (and that is not a health hazaard).  She doesn't really like the rawhide chews, which is good as they are not really good for dogs, especially if they have digestive issues.  Our dog just loves these and we have not had any issues at all.  No choking or throwing up like with the rawhide chews.  When I start to open the package she just comes running and is so excited!!  I am not overly thrilled that the first ingredient is corn, but since it is just a treat, and our little girl loves them, then I am giving this a 5 star rating!  And for the reviewer complaing that they are made in China .... now-a-days: what isn't?  Sure, I'd love to be able to purchase this awesome product knowing it was made here in the good ole USA, but since noone here in the good ole USA is making a treat my dog can eat without throwing up or choking ... DREAMBONE it is!!!!

review/summary: Pretty good product
review/text: Both of my dogs really enjoyed this rawhide alternative bone. My dogs have been eating real rawhide for several years, with seemingly no issues. Recently, one of my dogs had a terrifying near-death experience; choking on a rawhide. After doing some research, I learned that this isn't an uncommon situation, and that rawhides are a known choking hazard. After the incident, I quickly researched different rawhide alternative bones, and theses ones were one of the first we have tried. They have more of a leathery texture, softer and more flexible than a rawhide. However, they are not soft treats that can be chewed up quickly, it still took my dogs some time to eat them, and enjoying them for about 10 minutes. One thing that I really liked about these bones is that they don't get stringy, slimy, and sticky like rawhides do. They get softer with chewing, and then brake off into smaller pieces, unlike rawhides that won't brake off, making the dream bones less of a choking hazard. They only reason I gave them a 4 star rating and not a 5 star rating is because the first ingredient (the most prevalent) is corn. Corn isn't the greatest thing for pets to consume because its not easy to digest. I avoid corn in pet food at all costs, but because this is a treat- and not a main food staple, I think it is okay. I do recommend these- especially over regular rawhides. I would recommend the dental version more as those ones smell really good and contain parsley and chlorophyl and other good smelling ingredients that aren't present in the chicken flavor.

I check everything I buy for my dogs now because most products are made in china. Yes my dogs like them but I am not putting their health at risk. And they are a really strange rubbery texture. Does not look like something they should be ingesting. Anyway, I will never buy these again. Zero stars!

review/summary: Very crunchy, very good
review/text: I have purchased these cookies twice now (I'm backlogged, but I was afraid that Amazon wouldn't stock them again) and I'm slowly eating my way through them.<br /><br />Many people have attempted to describe the taste and I agree with most of the previous descriptions - they are not hyper sweet or milk chocolate-y, but rather almost like a darker chocolate taste.  Don't take me calling it dark chocolate to mean they're bitter, because they're not, but imagine the taste of a normal Hershey's bar if you removed half the sugar.  You'd still get the nice taste of chocolate, but just in a more subdued fashion.  If you have a chocolate craving, and not a sugar craving, you'll love these cookies.  If you have just a simple sweet tooth and a craving for sugar, well these may not be quite what you're looking for.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind is that these are what I would classify as "very hard" cookies.  Most of the cookies you find on the grocery stores now days contain quite a few fatty ingredients that make the cookie yield in your mouth instead of crunching.  These suckers crunch.  A lot.  I would even go far as to say that if you have dental issues, milk would be a requirement to eat these.  The texture is very similar to eating Nature's Valley granola bars (not the chewy ones).

I know you CAN eat things past the expiration date, but if I'd known the expiration date was 3 months later, I wouldn't have bought a 12 pack of them!<br /><br />If they taste this good, so close to their expiration date, I imagine the fresher ones are even better!

review/summary: Very Good, But Rock Hard Texture
review/text: I've had a great experience with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CR41CY">Newman's Own Organics Newman-O'S Ginger-O'S</a>, and was very pleased.  So I decided to try Cinnamon Graham Alphabet cookies.<br /><br />These cookies are not as sweet as the Newman's Own sandwich cookies, which is a big plus.  These are quite tasty with a good balance of natural sweeteners and the right amount of cinnamon.  While I prefer a strong cinnamon flavor, these cookies did not disappoint me.  It makes for a nice treat.  They barely pass my all-important "dunkability" test, or how they taste when dunked in milk.  While they dunk very well and absorb milk quickly and awaken the flavor of the sweetener and cinnamon, the cookies are so small that you'll be dunking fingers along with cookies.<br /><br />There are a few minuses; but given the quality of the cookies, they're minor:<br /><br />1) The cookies are smaller than I thought, so be careful giving them to small children.  But I'm sure they'll love them.<br />2) Because of their size, it makes them very easy to overeat them.  Despite their all-natural organic ingredients, they're still cookies: They're not very nutritious, they're very sweet and are high in calories.  Self-control is essential.<br />3) These cookies are amazingly hard to chew; they are very crunchy.  Eating them helps me to appreciate how hard dogs work to chew dog biscuits.  Your molars will get some work chewing these down.<br /><br />As with all groceries sold by Amazon, I suggest buying a pack at a supermarket and trying it before buying the case.  But I'm confident you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Arrowroot Newman's Alphabet Cookies
review/text: After googling these and seeing that some people are obsessed with the arrowroot variety, I thought I would give them a try. They taste basically like graham crackers or maybe animal crackers with strong taste of honey. It's great that they have no trans fats, minimal chemical ingredients, are mostly organic, and "non-profit"; but they're nothing to get excited about. The hard texture is a pro/con in that it forces you to eat carefully, and limits your desire to gorge. These are good non-lethal commercial cookies, but like all commerical cookies are lacking in nutrition and taste.

review/text: MY FAVORITE COOKIES! I love Oreos without the cream and these are perfect. They taste just like the ice-box cake cookies sold in the larger flat cookies, too.... BUT.....<br />I need to know exactly what "natural flavoring" is because I react horribly to MSG and similar glutamate heavy "altered 'natural' foods" that are allowed by the FDA. I am trying to eliminate even small amounts from my diet to prevent future effects that build up with the trace amounts you get in each item.  The FDA allows many flavor enhancing trace chemicals that have the same effects as glutamates on people.... but they don't have to specifically list them and it leaves me in a tough spot for enjoying packaged foods :(<br />I can't wait to start chomping these again!!  :)

I also like the crunch (it's really not too hard). And they're better for you than those "elf-made" snacks. My one problem with these is that I can't stop eating them once I start! There's just something about them that makes me go to town on the bag, and I'm not a craver/compulsive-type eater by any means. Then there's the organic ingredients, and the responsible business practices and charitable contributions of the company - what's not to like? For me these are 10 stars **********

review/summary: "Lower", not "low" sodium
review/text: Pacific Natural is a great brand and Light Sodium Organic Creamy Tomato Soup is a winning product. It is a rich, flavorful, smooth soup. A bowl of this is a tasty and convenient way to have one of the five daily recommended servings of fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />I take off one star because I have recently begun counting my sodium intake and this soup often puts my daily total over. I'm just trying to not exceed the normal, recommended amounts of sodium, nothing drastic. I wish Pacific Natural Foods would sell a version of their soups with no added salt, at all. We could carefully add our own salt, or not. Actually, it would be perfect if they made a "super light sodium" version with 50% less salt than this, the "50% less salt" version. I could have it every day.<br /><br />This has 380 mg per 1 cup serving. This is a lower amount than the regular Organic Creamy Tomato by Pacific Natural Food, which has a whopping 750 mg per cup. For those who aren't watching their sodium, both of these soups will be good. But, I bought the "Low Sodium" version because of an interest in keeping daily sodium intake within recommended healthy levels. Comparing it to frozen "healthy" entrees, this has more sodium than some "main dishes". As a side dish, this has a significant amount of added salt.<br /><br />For watching calories and nutrients (like sodium) there's a great, free website at "everydayhealth.com". Users can list every thing eaten and it calculates the fat, protein, sugar carbohydrates and sodium for each day. I find this a tremendously helpful resource. It has an expanded nutritional content view that allows easy scanning and comparison of foods. Things with with higher salt, fat or sugar are easy to spot. This soup comes up on the higher-sodium side of things I eat.<br /><br /> It has been a revelation how much salt is in most prepared foods. Even "healthy" brands like Weight Watchers, Eating Right, Lean Cuisine, Amy's, O Organics, Morningstar Farms, etc. have enough sodium to make hitting targets difficult. For salt-watching fans of this soup, you may not be doing as well as you thought. I'll still buy this, but will eat it less often/in smaller portions. Looks like cooking from scratch is best to insure not overdoing the salt. Too bad, easy to prepare, healthy meals are a great convenience and there is a place for them in this busy world. Enjoy the soup, but count the milligrams!

review/summary: Best Soup That You Didn't Make Yourself
review/text: Some soups are forgettable cups of nutrition, others are memorable only for their imbalance - too salty, too tart, too concentrated, too bland....  Certainly packaged soups are the worst offenders.  Behold Pacific Foods Light Sodium Organic Creamy Tomato.  At long last, perfect balance in a packaged soup.  The tomato flavor, the core issue here, is not only warm and tangy, it's got that little hint of sweetness that only appears in a fresh tomato.  I can't imagine how Pacific Foods does it - you'd swear it was pulled from the vine on a summer's day and magically transported into your mug.  The creaminess is a velvety blanket of affection that surrounds you, yet never overwhelms the tomato flavor.  And while my homemade soups can not stand without the support of chicken stock or beef broth, somehow Pacific Foods has worked even more magic by making this soup completely vegetarian, yet full-dimensional and rich.<br />Now if only Amazon could figure out how to pack the shipment a bit better....  cleaning off 11 cartons because the 12th got bashed in transit - no fun.  Ah well, at least I can console myself with another mug of perfection.

review/summary: Wonderful, rich tasting tomato soup
review/text: As a child Campbell's tomato soup was a staple at my house, but the high sodium content held me back from feeding it to my own kids. I happened upon this at the grocery store one day and myself and my kids LOVED it. This is the only soup (of any flavor) that I can get my picky daughter to eat. Although this 'low sodium' version still has a considerable amount of sodium in it (most any prepackaged soup does), I figure since she doesn't eat it every day and our diet is generally low sodium anyway, it won't hurt anything...not to mention the health benefits of tomatoes which my daughter will not eat regularly.<br />This soup is very creamy and pairs well with a sandwich, crackers, or even grilled chicken. I often pack some in a thermos for my daughter's lunch. I would compare it to La Madeleine's creamy tomato basil soup but with a smoother texture and far less calories.

review/summary: scary, not sure what happened, manufacturing problem maybe
review/text: I have used Pacific Natural soup products before, and bought a case of these to try the organic creamy tomato. I had these in my cabinet for one month after receiving them in good condition from Amazon, and one of them exploded in the case!  They had been stored at room temperature, and it's not that hot in SF. I was a bit disturbed by what type of conditions in the box would have caused such an explosion (out of the top of the box, and it got all over everything), so i threw the entire 10 unused boxes away.  the one box i had consumed, was very mild tasting, but good (thus the 2 stars).  i don't think i'll be puchasing these again, since ive never had a commercially packaged product contaminated w bacteria (most likely) before. i can a lot of foods, so i'm always careful about processing -at a minimm, there may be a quality control problem, since the shipping and packaging appeared solid. Yikes!

review/text: The one star is for Nuticity's advertisement of a product that apparently does not exist.  Knotts Berry Farm used to produce the best strawberry preserves at a reasonable price.  However at least a couple years ago it was bought out by Smuckers, and I have not been able to find Knotts Berry Farm products on any shelves.  I was surprised at Nutricity's Knotts Berry Farm Preserve Strawberry being "In Stock," and although the offer was pricey, I ordered the pack of 12 on May 26th. The order was delayed and delayed. I wrote to Nutricity through Amazon on 6/8 and was assured that this was just a processing delay.  Nutricity cancelled the order today 6/21.  (My credit card was never charged.)  What is surprising is that they are allowed to keep it showing as "In stock" on the Amazon page.  That would appear not to be correct.<br /><br />Coyote

review/summary: Banana pancakes, a Saturday morning tradition
review/text: My family loves Bisquick pancakes.  Most Saturday mornings I take one of these mixes, add an 8 oz bottle of water, mash and add a couple of ripe bananas and make the best pancakes you have ever tasted.<br /><br />The ripeness of the bananas directly effects the taste of the pancakes, they must be ripe.  We take ripe bananas, peel them, bag them and freeze them so that they will be ready for pancake day.  If there is banana juice in the bag be sure to pour it into the mix too.<br /><br />Try it, you'll probably love it.<br /><br />This mix makes enough pancakes for about three adults, maybe a little more.

review/summary: Quick and Easy; great to have on hand
review/text: For decades, I would always make pancake mix from scratch (and to be honest, it's really not that difficult to do so.)  But now that I have less time and perhaps out of laziness, I've switched to this product.  It's REALLY EASY.  Literally all you do is add water to the fill line (on side of jar), put lid back on and shake vigorously to mix.  It's not always that easy to get the mix at the bottom to mix with the water and their suggestion of tapping the bottom doesn't work.  But the mix turns out just fine.  It doesn't make the nice fluff, airy pancakes that you can get from homemade mixes but it makes perfectly fine, tasty regular pancakes.  And you can't beat the convenience.  They're great to have on hand even as back ups.  This particular size (10.6oz) I found too large for just my son and I but the smaller size is perfect.  And it's easy to make pancakes for him whenever he wants.

review/summary: crepe-pancake
review/text: I use the "thinner" ratio on the bottle and the resulting product is more like a crepe-pancake than a pancake.  And it's DELICIOUS.  Definitely my favorite way to have pancakes.  I use butter in the pan and don't find these to be bland at all.  In my opinion you don't need to add anything (like bananas or chocolate chips, etc) unless you want to, and you don't even need syrup.  The resulting pancake is a buttery slightly-salty wonder.<br /><br />I can imagine needing to add syrup, etc if you use the "thicker" ratio, because then the pancakes would be thicker, cakier, and more dry.  But if you make the thin version, you don't get bogged down in a thicky cakey middle.<br /><br />I love this.  I honestly think these pancakes are better than anything I'd make myself "from scratch" or that I've had in a restaurant, etc.  And that's not surprising.  Bisquick's whole business is essentially pancakes.  You'd think they'd get it right.  And they have!  Nothing to be ashamed of to really love their mix.  Just because they're commercial doesn't mean it's not a great pancake.<br /><br />(again, try the thinner version!)

Since we do grocery shopping once a month we were looking for 6 to 8 and could only find 2 or 3. We looked on line and found a company to purchase from for a reasonable price except they wanted $10 per bottle for shipping, $60 for six bottles, really? We did not know that Amazon also dealt with food products but we search anyway. Not only did we find the product, we found it slightly lower than the store price and FREE SHIPPING! We bought 2 cases and plan to purchase a case a month especially in the summer time when we camp. This is an excellent product which can be altered to your liking. For instance we add Hershey's chocolate syrup into the bottle and make chocolate pancakes.

review/summary: Shaking the "cakes" for our family reunion
review/text: Over the last weekend in June, my committee and I put on a 135th family reunion for over 160 people. That in itself can be a feat but let's just add that this three day event was held in a field with porto potties, no running water and a generator for some lights at night. One of the main features of this gathering is the Sunday pancake breakfast. My husband built a 6 ft x 2 ft propane griddle that could cook 36 pancakes at once but the thought of mixing eggs, milk and pancake mix into batter without proper clean up facilities really presented a problem. Then, I thought about the Bisquick Shake N'Pour mixes that I use when we go camping during the summer and "Googled" them to check cost. Amazon had cases of 10.6 oz bottles...I bought 5 cases..just add water and shake and pour on the griddle and the pancakes were great. Without the cost of milk and eggs I believe we actually saved money. We did not end up with lots of unused, mixed batter, smaller batches were easier to control. Clean up involved tossing the plastic containers in the recycling. Couldn't be more thrilled. We also have a lot of converts who had not tried the product before but after having tried it will be buying it in the future. Great with blueberries and chocolate chips tossed in as well.

review/text: This is an okay version of dairy-free mac & cheese.  I looked at the advice of other reviewers and added 3/4 cup (instead of 1/2 cup) of hemp milk and a tablespoon of vegan Earth Balance buttery spread to the powdered cheese mix.  This seemed like the right balance to have a cheese sauce that wasn't too liquidy or to powdery/lumpy.  The pasta, as others have said, is very good.  The cheese flavor could use a little more flavor but it's okay for a standard dairy-free mac & cheese.  I added some Dunya cheese to it which melted and that helped slightly.  I recently became vegan so this helped me get through a mac & cheese craving but I probably won't make/buy again.

review/summary: Closest to Mac n Cheese As A Vegan Can Get
review/text: In short, this stuff is pretty fantastic! I've been vegan for 5 years for reference. No, it's not anything like your Kraft Mac n' Cheese, but it has a great, savory flavor nonetheless. Do NOT buy this if you're expecting something that mimics cheddar. You'll especially like the flavor if you cook with nutritional yeast, go for it!<br /><br />The pasta cooks nicely, its whole wheat macaroni that takes a little longer to cook than white pasta would, but the consistency is as good as any other pasta if you cook it right and drain.<br /><br />I made my sauce with Rice Dream rice milk. Like any powdered sauce mix, I wouldn't suggest pouring the entire thing in the pot at once! Put your desired milk product in the pot, then slowly stir in the powder to make sure you work any lumps that develop from the powder. I've found this is easier to do while its on low heat. Then you can add the pasta and kick up the heat a little bit as you mix it. The sauce gets nice and creamy! So glad I got this! Good job, Road's End! YUMMY!

review/summary: So Delicious.
review/text: This is a great product. Let me start by saying I'm a vegan and have not consumed cheese in 4 years. But from what I remember of the cheese flavor and texture this is really close. No this does not taste like Kraft mac and cheese, I feel like the taste is more like something you would get at a deli.<br />Contrary to what other reviewers stated, I find the pasta to be my least favorite part of this product. I do have a few tips on making the sauce:<br />1. when mixing it with the milk product really do get all the clumps to dissolve<br />2. when you drain the noodles, leave the burner on the side ON so when you do put the sauce with noodles back on the burner to stir it instantly starts to thicken the sauce<br />3. also I recommend to follow the suggestion on the box to add a tablespoon of butter or a butter substitute to enhance the flavor. I add this as I'm stirring the noodles and cheese sauce together for the first time<br /><br />I really do enjoy this product especially the easiness(if I speed make it. I can cook it in 15 min). Maybe for the average dairy consumer this just doesn't cut the cake, but at least for those who do not consume dairy, for whatever reason, this is an awesome replacement.

The mix makes a really smooth bechamel-style "cheese" sauce with a nice stretchy quality. I love to serve it with bbq tofu and greens - the absolute vegan comfort meal.

You are also supposed to add 1/2 cup soymilk, but I have found that it needs an entire cup.<br />*With 400 mg of sodium per 320 calorie serving, it's a little high in sodium (but not very high)<br />*The flavor of the sauce should be bolder. The texture is very good and creamy, but the flavor is somewhat bland. I think if they added 25% more spices they would be spot on.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this product. Nutritionally it is rather healthy, the price is good, and the flavor is also good.

review/summary: Does NOT taste remotely similar to cheese
review/text: I'm allergic to dairy & due to recent events I've had to give up the little bit of dairy that I was able to eat previously. I ended up buying this mac & chreese in the hopes of finding something similar to the old favorite that I loved so much. Note that I said *similar* & not identical. While I've tasted some vegan cheeses that were pretty close to the real thing, I wasn't expecting a miracle from a powder.<br /><br />Oh boy... where do I start... Well, first I'll start with the good. The pasta isn't bad. It cooks up nice & firm, just like I would want it to. The pasta is probably the one thing about this that I'd probably try again, if it came in a package by itself.<br /><br />But the bad part is the sauce. Not only does it NOT taste remotely like cheese, but it's this icky sloppy mess that reminds me more of garlic than cheese. My first attempt with this sauce might have had too much water, as it was a little too soupy, but my second attempt (I was willing to try it again to see if I'd prepared it wrong) wasn't much better. The taste didn't improve with either attempt.<br /><br />As far as mac & vegan cheese goes, I think I'll go back to the old fashioned way of making it (noodles & melting vegan cheese) instead of the instant route. I wasn't expecting a miracle with this, but I was hoping that the sauce would at least attempt to taste like cheese or be tasty in some regards. This just wasn't for me.<br /><br />If you try this, just remember that it isn't going to taste like anything remotely cheesy. Just go to the store & get one box of this stuff before buying it in bulk here on amazon.

review/summary: Scant sauce
review/text: While this product offered a convenient vegan alternative to other commercial products, it was sort of sad looking on the plate, with a minimal amount of sauce that dried up quickly.  I added 1/2c of MimicCreme and 1 tbls of EarthBalance.  Blech. Back to making "cheesy" nutritional yeast sauce from scratch.

review/summary: Sauce needs work.
review/text: I don't like Roads End's cheese sauce.  It needed at least twice as much liquid as they say to add.  Even then the sauce was gloppy and didn't taste particularly cheesy.  I really wanted to love this as the price is so much better than Namaste Foods mac & cheese.  Namaste Foods product is far superior.  I also tried Edward & Sons cheese flavored mashed potatoes which contains Roads End cheese sauce and it wasn't very good either.  The other varieties of Edward & Sons potatoes were really delicious so the problem is Roads End's cheese sauce mix.  So disappointing.<br /><br />The pasta cooked up well though.  I wish it were wheat free though.

review/summary: vegan mac & cheese!
review/text: We love this easy tasty vegan mac & cheese. If you want a fat free meal all you add is soy milk. If you want a richer pasta sauce you can add a dab of earth balance margarine. We like to add peas & carrots to ours for a full meal. Products like this make it easy to stay vegan and healthy.

review/summary: Organic, Whole Wheat, Vegan Deliciousness!
review/text: I totally love this stuff! It the best of the Road's End bunch.<br /><br />Some tasty options: If you truly have a craving for a more cow-cheesey flavor, mix in a bit of yellow mustard (maybe a teaspoon or two). Somehow it works. Or just for fun, try a dash of curry, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic powder, dried or sauteed onions, diced fresh tomatoes, chopped steamed broccoli/cauliflower, green peas, fresh or dried herbs or even...ketchup. Yes! I love ketchup on my Mac! The sodium and fat content in the boxed package as is, is low enough that you could, frankly, crank it up a ton with stuff and still be eating healthy. I wonder if they did that on purpose? Either way, I love it as is, but I also love it a million different "homemade" ways. Have fun with your Mac & Chreese!<br /><br />Peace to you.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />=)

review/summary: pasta ok, sauce not so good
review/text: great to find gluten/dairy free pasta choices, but... their included sauces (I've tried several flavors) leave a terrible after taste. the pasta (without the sauce) is ok...  I'd buy their pasta again if it were made available without the sauce.

review/summary: Vegan Mac and Cheese
review/text: I would say this rates around standard for your non-dairy mac n cheese. It's alright, edible, and filling but not amazing and something you would be craving to have again. I like that it's organic and whole wheat at a decent price. Not sure I would buy it again as I expected something a little more cheesy like. I rather get some noodles and pasta sauce over this.

review/summary: Great product, great Amazon price!
review/text: The Road's End Mac and Chreese is such a great convenience food for vegans or anyone avoiding dairy.  The sauce is made with nutritional yeast, so it tastes somewhat cheesey but definitely not like conventional mac and cheeses.  Make sure you follow the directions on the box and re-warm the sauce and pasta to thicken it.  The first time I made it, I didn't do this and it wasn't nearly as good.<br />The mac and chreese is also really easy to bulk up to make a complete meal.  You can add in veggies or even veggie burgers (Sunshine burgers go really well with this.)<br /><br />Also, this is a great price.  It's almost half the price per box as it costs to buy in the grocery store.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: This is good stuff! When I went vegan the thing I missed most was cheese. I've gotten over it, but this "chreese" really brings back a flavor memory. Good texture, very smooth and creamy, and no nasty dairy. Excellent replacement for Mac-n-cheese. I doubt that your family would even know the difference. I'm sure it's more healthy too, not that it matters to me.

review/summary: not very good at all
review/text: I was very disappointed with this dairy free mac and cheese -- I did it like I would make other mac and cheese  -- I always melt the butter and add the mix - then the milk  --  ( I tried both soy and regular-- )  mix them in sauce pan  -- I was upset because first of price and then it tasted terrible --  I have done other mac and cheese mixes and there is something wrong with calling them mac and cheese --  They are elbows and whatever the sauce is -- It tastes like card board-- I have used lots of different soy cheeses - and other non dairy mixes -- this is awful  --  I wouldn't waste your money on it  --

review/summary: Just what I wanted.  but NOT individually packed
review/text: Exactly as pictured EXCEPT each stick is NOT individually wrapped - they are unwrapped although packed well (paper separating each layer of sticks).  I found no breakage at all.  Just had my daughter re-pack in a plastic air-tight (and hopefully insect-proof!) container.  That's the only reason I gave a 4 out of 5 on the review.  But the price certainly is right - least expensive I've seen on Amazon.  So - if you are a major home-coffee drinker, or going to have a special party - I think these are a good deal.  And fun to eat.
