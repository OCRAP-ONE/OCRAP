review/text: This item was purchased for my mother who really wanted them. Imagine our surprise when worry beads, something meant to be held and rubbed on , broke in less than 3 days. Then imagine when the same breads were returned and you were given 1/3 of what you paid because they are claiming you sent back something with nothing the matter with it. This company sells junk and then lies on top of it. Shop elsewhere or you will have to deal with all kinds of JUNK.

review/summary: Nice Bold Earthy Flavor!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this tea! From the minute I first smelled its earthy, nutty scents (with hints of tobacco and leather), I knew it would be a delightful morning tea. I couldn't have been more right. For those who love boldly flavored and earthy teas, this is a must try.<br /><br />As one who has recently given up coffee (got tired of the jitters and crash), I have been searching for teas with bold and robust flavors, like in coffee. I do not exaggerate when I say that this tea has the boldest and most interesting and  complex flavor I've experienced (without the bitterness of many "bold" black teas).<br /><br />Coincidentally, this tea also has nearly as much caffeine as coffee. As with all teas, though, the caffeine absorbs into the bloodstream at a much slower rate, leaving the drinker jitter- and crash-free. (For the curious, this seems due to the fact that the caffeine in tea bonds with the tannins, making it much harder to metabolize.)<br /><br />Thus, this morning mate is not only absolutely delicious for its nutty and earthy, yet smooth, flavor, but is great for concentration and energy. I cannot reccomend it enough, particularly for those looking for boldness from their tea!

review/summary: Great morning tea
review/text: My Morning Mate is a mix of mate, black tea, and red rooibos. Listed under ingredients are sweet cocoa, chocolate and almond bits, pistachio nuts, macadamia nuts and coriander with warm hazelnut and cinnamon.<br /><br />Some of the reviews on the Teavana site state that they think this tastes like coffee.  It does not taste like coffee but mate has a very distinct taste.  Although the ingredient list is extensive, I think it mostly tastes nutty.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it is not my favorite mate tea-it is a little bitter to be 5 stars.

review/summary: Okay but not Cake Mate
review/text: I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon.

Only gripes: the "partially-hydrogenated" ingredient and non-resealable bag.  By the way, the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get - it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting.

review/text: Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!

review/summary: Makes a splendid risotto
review/text: Fans of Tyler Florence will know that this is Tyler's favorite rice for doing risotto.  He prefers it to any rice at any price when it comes time to do a risotto.  Whilst I remain unconvinced that this the absolute best rice for risotto, there can be no doubt that it makes one hell of a splendid risotto.  I wowed two different groups of guests with risottos that sprang from this rice.  I was very pleased with the results.<br /><br />It's very reasonably priced also.  It can be had for 31% of the price of one of it's Carnaroli rivals.  Amazon will give you four kilos for almost the same price as 1 kilo of the Carnaroli.  Does Carnaroli yield better results?  I don't think so.  This rice yields equal or better results.<br /><br />This is a smart buy for fine risotto.  I strongly recommend it.

review/summary: The Best There Is.  Don't Hesitate.
review/text: We lived in Italy for 20+ years and this is the same brand I bought over there.  In Italy they use the different kinds of rice for different dishes.  Most folks in the USA seem to know about arborio, but it is considered the lowest grade of rice and is primarily used for cold rice salad and puddings.  Carnaroli rice is typically used for seafood risotto as it is a finer grain, which is appropriate with delicate seafood.  Vialone Nano is what is used to make the best risottos whether they are homemade or in a restaurant.  Vialone Nano is a far superior grain to arborio and will make delicious, creamy risotto regardless of what you use -- sausages, mushrooms, saffron, asparagus, truffles, and yes, even seafood.  The packages are vacuum packed, which is also much better than buying the rice in bags or boxes.  We love this rice and so does everyone we serve it to.

The honey taste was prominent, however I really couldn't taste the peanuts. It was good with and without milk; I tried it dry as a snack and it did a great job of stopping that sweet craving mid-afternoon. I don't know how it's really considered 'healthy' for you, as it's loaded with sugars but as an occasional treat, I'd definitely go for it. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to look for it, but if it's BOGO at the local grocery store, I'd definitely buy a box now and again.

review/summary: Crunchy but too sweet
review/text: This is a decent tasting cereal, but it's way too sweet in my opinion. Yes, it's crunchy and stays crunchy even in milk, but it's because of the sugar coating on the flakes, not because of the nuts. The nuts are ground very fine, almost too fine, so they don't add much crunch or flavor to the flakes. The honey taste is fairly subtle. If the nuts were crunchier, more flavorful and there was less sugar in the cereal, it might taste better, as well as be healthier. Although I didn't hate it, I doubt I'd buy this one again.

review/text: I liked the initial crunch, similar to Honey Bunches of Oats or Frosted Flakes but more sugar coating.  Then after the taste settled in there was a burnt taste that I couldn't quite identify.  It seemed like molasses to me but my son said it tasted like burnt caramels.  I would agree with that.  It was good cereal, not great...It was just too sugary for me.  I never did get the peanut taste unless it was the burnt peanut oil taste that we were mistaking for molasses/caramels.  There was just a weird aftertaste that nobody in the family could identify.  I wouldn't purchase again.  It was OK. Not worth the price nor calories from all the added sugar.

review/text: i'm very satisfied with the taste and quality of kellogg's crunchy nut cereal. i have a somewhat wandering tastebud when it comes to cereal, never really sticking to any one particular brand. this cereal however, may become a staple in the house for a few months at least, before my wanderlust is stirred (and that's saying something, considering my habits) and i venture forth for different flavors. i love that the cereal is peppered with crunchy peanuts and the honey provides just the right touch of sweetness and kick to the mix. fantastic!

review/summary: Frosted Flakes with molasses-peanut flavor added
review/text: I love cereal, and one of my favorites is Frosted Flakes.  Kellogg's, maker of Frosted Flakes, introduced this new Crunchy Nut cereal in 2 forms.  This type is a flaked, sugar-coated cereal with tiny chunks of peanuts on the flakes themselves.  Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut has two layers of flavor.  The primary flavor is exactly like Frosted Flakes, and the cereal has the same shape and even similar texture and sugary glaze.  The secondary flavors would, according to the name of the product, supposedly taste like honey and nut, but what I taste the most is molasses.  That is an ingredient in the cereal, as is sugar, honey, and corn syrup.  Lot of forms of sugar in this cereal.  Despite having honey in it, I notice no honey flavor at all.  There was another, harder to identify taste which was I finally realized was peanut, but it was overwhelmed by the other sweet flavors.  Despite little peanut bits on the flakes, it didn't immediately taste peanutty to me.  Overall, the molasses flavor left a weird aftertaste that I did not find pleasant.  These weren't flakes I could eat right out of the box, as milk was necessary to tone down the powerful, almost cloying taste.  The flakes did stay crunchy in milk for quite a while as compared to a lot of other cereals.  I think Kellogg's could reduce the sweetness by a significant amount and improve this cereal drastically.

review/summary: Yummy on Yogurt!
review/text: Exactly like good old-fashioned corn flakes (with regards to crunch and lightness), with the added flavor of honey and crumbled peanuts. I'm not a fan of these with milk, as I don't like soggy cereal. Instead, I sprinkle them on yogurt, cottage cheese, or ice cream. They don't end up mushy and they add great crunch and nutty flavor to my plain boring snack.

review/summary: Really Yummy
review/text: Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is one of the few "tasty" cereals I've had that is not "go into a coma" super sweet.  At first blush I just thought it would be Frosted Flakes with a nutty taste added in, but it is far different.  Althought similar in look to Frosted Flakes, the "frosting" almost like maple and it's more like a glaze, but very good.  Also the peanut addition is wonderful with actual nuts on the flakes.  It somewhat hard to pin down a similarity to this cereal - Frosted Flakes is not a good comp as it tastes NOTHING like it.  I remember a cereal that had flakes topped with maple syrup taste and from what I can remember, this is similar, but the addition of peanuts makes it completely different.  Conversely the kids didn't really like it, although 2 of my 3 kids now have decided they don't like peanut butter, so maybe that has something to do with it...  Eitherway this is definitely something I will be buying again - if for no other reason than Dad will have a good tasting cereal in the house that is "just Dad's"!

review/text: If you ever tasted Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, then nothing new here. Same texture plus added nut bits and honey. The cereal does taste good, very sweet if thats what you like. But loses a star because there is really minimal difference in taste to their Frosted Flakes. Crunchy Nut fails to be something "NEW" from their original product.

review/summary: Just like the old Nut N' Honey Crunch???
review/text: I was excited to get the chance to try out this cereal because from the description it remind me of 'Nut N' Honey Crunch' cereal that Kellogg's had on the market about 20 years ago. I was a big fan of that cereal but I found this new cereal to be overly sweet. And even though it says it has peanuts on the flakes, and yes you can see them, I could not taste peanuts whatsoever. I am sure for those out there who never experienced the deliciousness that was 'Nut N' Hioney Crunch', they will enjoy this cereal. As for me it was just too sweet to enjoy.

review/summary: Heavy on flavor, light on crunch
review/text: This cereal provides the great quality that is expected from Kellogg's in a new, delicious flavor. I'm a big fan of crunch in cereal, and, though this one touts its crunch, the nuts are barely noticeable. The main draw here is the flavor. It's great mixed with other cereals (honey granola, Cheerios, or even Corn Flakes), or better yet slice up a banana and add to the deliciousness.

review/summary: Yummy! Crunchy Nutty Goodness!!!
review/text: This cereal is absolutely delicious!<br />It has a slight honey flavor that is just right, not overpowering or too sweet. I am not a fan of sugary cereals, but my husband is, and we both really like this cereal<br />Each bite actually stays crunchy which is great because I hate getting to last half of the bowl of cereal and it being soggy, this cereal really held its crunchiness! The nuts are great, they are peanuts and I have not tried a cereal like this before. I am not a fan of almonds or walnuts and those seem to be the only types of nuts that I have found in cereals.<br />The regular size bowl of cereal fills me up and keeps me full until lunch time but also is a great snack at any time of the day or night!

review/summary: Flavorful and a crunchy texture
review/text: If you're wondering what Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is like, it can be summed up this way: it is basically a sweeter version of Corn Flakes . . . the flakes are crispier, slightly thicker, and coated in light honey with sprinkles of ground peanuts . . . hardly imaginative, but it's a reliable cereal making formula and works well. If you're looking to add some sweetness to your normally bland Corn Flakes, without much of a sugar/calorie penalty, this is an excellent way to do that. So why don't I give 5 stars? Eh, well, there is nothing wrong with the product, except it could be a bit denser in a variety of minerals and vitamins, and I have to be massively enthusiastic to give 5. I won't be ordering the 4-pack through subscription, as I do with Cheerios, for example. So I don't love this cereal, but you may . . . I like it, and will buy the occasional box every now and again at the grocery store.

review/summary: Very tasty, but needs more nutritional value
review/text: Sure I love the taste of the sugary sweetness of this cereal. Tastes like frosted flakes with honey and nut mixed in. Unfortunately, with no (ok, less than 1 gram) fiber, they don't provide the nutrition that I need. The nutritional panel is basically carbs... 11 of 26 which are sugar. I kept eating, but I never felt full, but I sure did get a ton of empty calories. I can't recommend this to anyone looking to eat a hearty breakfast. If you are looking for corn, sugar, peanuts, and honey (first four ingredients) and don't care about nutrition, this cereal is for you. For everyone else, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Full Ingredients: (look at all the sugar)<br />Milled Corn, Sugar, Peanuts, Honey, Malt Flavoring, Molasses, Salt, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Caramel Color, Iron, Annatto Extract Color, Niacinamide, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Sodium Ascorbate (Vitamin C), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), Thiamin Hydrochloride (Vitamin B1), Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Vitamin A Palmitate, Vitamin B12, Folic Acid, Bht (Preservative), Vitamin D, Wheat Starch.

review/summary: Delicious, not the most nutricious.
review/text: Crunchy Nut is really good. I was dubious at first because there are a ton of honey and nut flavored cereals out there and I didn't see how a new one would stand out. Crunchy Nut stands apart because it is VERY nutty tasting. The predominate flavor here is actually peanuts, then honey coated corn flakes. I loved it but it just isn't that good for you (hence, the 4 stars). Crunchy nut definitely falls into the sugary-cereal category but it tastes so good that one box lasted only a couple days.

review/summary: Good Standard Cereal
review/text: I enjoyed this cereal.  I will probably get it again.<br /><br />I thought it tasted good and the texture was excellent.  It never got soggy in milk- although I didn't test this to any extreme.  The taste of honey wasn't prominent, but there was a "nut" flavor that I enjoyed.<br /><br />My son and grandson also enjoyed it- as evidenced by the fact that they just about emptied the box during their weekend visit.<br /><br />Now, that said, it's nothing really special- just a sweetened corn flake style cereal.  It's rather sweet- too sweet for my wife (as I'm writing this she just said that all breakfast cereals belong on the candy isle), but probably about the same as "frosted flakes."<br /><br />The ingredients bear this out, with the first three ingredients being "milled corn, sugar, peanuts" followed by "honey" and a bunch of various things they put in cereal- including high fructose corn syrup and salt.<br /><br />So, its not a health food store type product. If you're looking for a American style, sweetened cereal to enjoy, I suggest that you give this stuff a try.

review/summary: A "better" Frosted Flake!!!
review/text: The flavor was not too sweet, or too plain. We jokingly referred to it as "Corn Flakes on Steroids", due to the richness of flavor and amazing crunch. One of the first things we noticed was that it does not get soggy by the time you get to the bottom of the bowl. It's also very filling-unlike Corn Flakes, for instance, to which I always feel compelled to add some fruit to. The flavor is rich and round, and the nuts are very satisfying-it's so good, I've caught myself eating it as a snack, even without milk. Highly recommended-yummy!

review/summary: Get some! (here's why)
review/text: Kellogg's really hit it out of the park this time. I'm not a huge cold cereal fan but it didn't take me long to wipe out this box.<br /><br />It stays *plenty* crunchy after pouring on the milk.<br /><br />It tastes terrific. Does it taste like peanuts? No, I didn't detect that but I'm sure this ingredient makes it more crunchy.<br /><br />The sweetness level (from honey) is just right; however, I do add a little box of raisins to a large bowlful just because I like fruit in my cereal. Bananas are great with this too.<br /><br />This cereal actually tops *Kellogg's Special-K Red Berries* [which I love] from my view.<br /><br />Total fat [daily values] = 2%; cholesterol = 0%; sodium = 10%; carbs = 11%; and, lots of vitamins including a high content of iron and folic acid. One-half cup of cereal yields 160 calories (with fat-free milk.)<br /><br />This will be the first food item that I've acquired [for free] through the Amazon Vine program which I plan to go to the grocery and buy more of. Terrific stuff -- I'm sold.<br /><br />My highest recommendation.

review/summary: Quite Sweet, Mildly Nutty
review/text: This is a very crispy, crunchy cereal with a mild peanut taste and a heavy molasses overtone.  It is quite sweet, the second ingredient after corn being sugar.  I have a sweet tooth and this was too sweet for me, so I guess that's saying something!<br /><br />It does contain a small amount of High Fructose Corn Syrup for those wishing to avoid it.  It's buried in the ingredients, so we can't know exactly how much there is, but I assume not much.  It makes me wonder why they even had to include it.<br /><br />It stays crisp in milk until the bowl is done (assuming, of course, you're not using an outrageously large bowl), and my cat (who also has a sweet tooth) likes the leftover milk.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the cereal well enough, it really was just too sweet in my opinion, so I would not repurchase.<br /><br />Allergen information:  Of course, if you are allergic to peanuts, you'll want to avoid this one.

review/summary: Perfect Cereal!
review/text: Ask my husband what he wants for dinner on almost any night and you'll get one of two answers: "hamburgers", or "cereal". The man loves his cereal so much that both of our kids are sick of eating it, if that tells you anything, so who better to review Kellogg's new Crunchy Nut than a cereal lover?<br /><br />My husband refused to take a bite of the cereal until it had milk on it - it's a thing for him. Once he'd put it in the bowl with some milk he let it sit for a short minute before taking his first bite. And his second, and his third, and so on. Before I knew it the bowl was gone and he was debating a second one.<br /><br />Yes, it's that good. And better yet? He didn't put ANY sugar on it, which is not normal for him. I've seen him drown his cereals in enough sugar to make my teeth ache, so the fact that he was able to enjoy it without any extra sugar is definitely a plus!<br /><br />We had a problem with the company calling it "crunchy nut". While there's a slight tang of nut in the cereal, what you really get is a honey flavor. We thought they should be called something different, like Honey Flakes or Crunchy Honey.<br /><br />There's only one downside to this - we ran out! Time to get more!!

review/summary: Too Sweet for Breakfast
review/text: Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal consists of corn flakes covered in honey and bits of peanuts.  It is somewhat crunchy, although not any more so than most other cereals.  Compared to a lot of other breakfast cereals, it doesn't have large amounts of vitamins or minerals, but it does have 25% of the daily recommended values of vitamins B6 and B12, as well as iron.  There are also small amounts of fiber and protein.<br /><br />The key characteristic of this cereal is that it is almost overwhelmingly sweet, with sugar making up more than 35% of each serving, by weight.  The second ingredient listed on the box is sugar, and is also contains molasses, honey, and high fructose corn syrup.  It is so sweet that I could only just make out the tastes of honey and peanuts.  There is no way that I could ever eat this for breakfast, but it does make a nice dessert in very small amounts.  If you're looking for a very sweet, sugary cereal, this might be a good choice for you, but I probably won't be buying it again.

review/text: This new cereal tastes very good, although they are a bit on the sweet side for me.  They don't have much of a peanut taste, which is fine with me.  There strongest point is that they start crunchy and stay that way in milk.  I really hate mushy cereal and these last a long time in milk.  They have a honey taste that is very pleasing.  I find them a good snack dry also.<br /><br />For adults, like me, they may be a bit too sweet, but for kids they are probably about right.  I'm not a nutritionist, but I suspect that they are more nutritional than frosted flakes and taste much better.  Give them a try, especially if your into sweet cereals.

review/summary: You'd be a Nut not to love 'em
review/text: I've always been a fan of Frosted Flakes, maybe it was Tony the Tiger's stripey smile, or just the fact that they tasted like pure sugar glaze with a corny crunch. Unfortunately, my fandom only lasted until the flakes touched milk for more than a few seconds. Unless you've got speed-eating skills, the mushy sludge at the bottom of the bowl was less than appetizing.<br /><br />I'm not certain what I expected with this new cereal, but they were flakes, they were frosted, so what's not to like?<br /><br />On first bite, they are definitely a kissing cousin of Frosted Flakes, but they seemed crunchier, a bit more wheat flake taste and a bit less sugar and more almost caramelized. The nuttiness is very subtle, not a big chunk-o-almond or peanut hit, just little dots on the flakes that add to the crunchiness. And crunchy these are, from the first bite to nearly the last.<br /><br />They've managed to make a better flake, for sure! So, sorry Tony, your flakes are out, and the Cruncy Nut is definitely in at our house.

review/summary: Sweet and crunchy - great for breakfast and great as a snack!
review/text: I haven't eaten cereals in years and normally ate the sugary types like Fruit Loops, Sugar Frosted Flakes, Cap'n Crunch and the like mainly as a dry snack because I'm a sugar fiend and like my cereals sweet.  When I saw this I decided to try it since I haven't binged on cereal in a few years.<br /><br />I really like this cereal a lot because of the nice crunch (corn flakes) and sweet but not too sweet (honey) coating and light peanut taste.  To me the peanut taste is really light but other family members noticed the peanut taste easier than I was able to.  This works out as an excellent dry snack for me but to be thorough I tried it with whole milk and skim milk for the review.<br /><br />It stayed crunchy during the time I ate it with milk and was pleased with the mouthfeel, taste, and texture although I prefer it with whole milk rather than skim.  I believe I'll start buying some of this cereal since I like it a lot as a snack.  I don't eat breakfast so this will always be eaten as a snack by me.<br /><br />If you are a cereal eater I suggest you giving this a try.  I'm pretty sure you'll like this too if you do try it.  This really is a tasty cereal with a nice crunch.

review/summary: Very tasty -- Frosted Flakes, move over!
review/text: I found this cereal to be excellent - very similar in taste to Frosted Flakes, but without the huge jolt of sugar. The peanuts are very small - basically peanut bits that are stuck to the flakes. But, it does add a noticeable flavor to the cereal that complements the overall taste quite nicely. Although I've been a fan of Frosted Flakes forever, I would definitely pick this over Frosted Flakes 10 times out of 10 - it really is that good!<br /><br />Nowadays I try to eat high fiber cereals, such as Raisin Bran or Kashi, instead of the less nutritious (albeit usually more tasty) cereals. But for the occasional bowl, or mixed with a more healthy alternative, this really hits the spot. Highly recommend, especially if you enjoy Frosted Flakes.

review/summary: Yummy! Tastes like Kellogg's dusted your morning bowl of cornflakes with crushed peanut brittle!
review/text: I just got my first box of Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut today, and as soon as I opened the inner bag, a delicious, sweet scent reminiscent of Crunch & Munch wafted out. Since I've been eying these boxes at my local Wally World for a few weeks, I was excited to see what this cereal would taste like.<br /><br />At first glance, it was clear that there was plenty of honey and sugar glazing these flakes and gluing the small chips of peanut to said flakes. This cereal won't be your family's health nut's new favorite, but Kellogg's is also not hiding behind any unfounded health claims here. The nutritional information is easy to find, and it's about what you'd expect for a product named "Golden Honey Nut". It's also undoubtedly as delicious as you'd hope a food product by that name would be!<br /><br />After getting my first whiff, I HAD to have a bowl (of course, I'll probably only be having a salad as my actual dinner now tonight, but it was TOTALLY worth it)! As other reviewers here have mentioned, the heavy sugar/honey glaze keeps these very crunchy in milk for longer than you'd have with more lightly glazed flakes. I also noticed that within about 30 seconds' time of having the milk in my bowl of cereal, it was lightly colored by the honey coating (which turned my milk a soft honey yellow). I couldn't tell that there were peanut pieces on the flakes as I ate them, which I consider to be something of a good thing - it wouldn't be terribly pleasant to me to have to deal with chunks of peanut sticking to and between my teeth as I tried to get my bowl of morning sustenance down (I'm a die-hard cereal-for-breakfast kinda girl; always have been, always will be).<br /><br />Nutritionally speaking, this cereal compares closely to Honey Bunches of Oats. The two are quite similar in all of the stats you'd focus on, including the added vitamins and minerals. This cereal is delicious and satisfying, but if you're looking for Kashi's cousin, this isn't it (thankfully for me, too: Kashi's healthy, but it's not terribly tasty, IMHO).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this cereal. It's sweet, delicious and crunchy, and would also make a good, lower calorie substitution for your dessert, if you're so inclined (or a great crushed topping on yogurt or ice cream). Next time you're at the store, take a look at the stats for yourself, and if you're interested, grab a box. I doubt you'll regret it!<br /><br />Now, I'm off to enter my consumption data to my favorite online Sparkly dietary journal site! ; )

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I have been eating this by the handful. I haven't had it in a bowl of milk, but it is great just to snack on as well.<br />Flakes are a nice size, you can see the flakes are coated with the honey and barely any peanuts. The cereal smells a lot like peanuts but you can barely taste the peanut flavor. It has a nice sweet taste, taste like bunch of cereals I have had before one of them is Frosted flakes.<br />I think I would categorize this cereal more geared towards adults, but children would also like the flavor as well. It just doesn't have a fun mascot associated to it to get the kids but it is sweet enough for them.

review/summary: Lives up to its "crunchy" name
review/text: I predict this will be a big seller for Kelloggs.  While I am not usually a fan of flake cereals because most get mushy too fast, Crunchy Nut stays super crunchy all the way down to the bottom of the bowl.  It really has taste, as well.  To me it has a bit of a brown sugar taste which is neither bland nor sweet.  It will probably be popular with kids and adults alike. I personally didn't taste much of the peanut taste, although it appeared there were plenty of tiny nuggets of them "glued" to the flakes.  Perhaps if this is a selling feature, Kelloggs could amp up the peanut taste a little.  Crunchy Nut could get me more inclined to eat flake cereals more often.  I hope it succeeds.

review/summary: Frosted Flakes With Peanuts...But Where's Tony Tiger?
review/text: It could be called Frosted Flakes with Nuts because that is what it tastes like. I don't actually taste much of the nuts though, mostly the super sweet honey/sugar coating that is almost exact in flavor to Frosted Flakes with a hint of honey. The nuts seem to add crunch. This cereal is very sweet, almost too sweet. The first thought that struck my mind is that its almost like eating ice cream for breakfast. So the taste is there but is it a good way to start your day? The only wheat in it is wheat starch. The rest of the ingredients by order from the description, Milled corn, sugar, peanuts, honey, malt flavoring, molasses, salt, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color means this cereal, even though it also has some vitamins, is probably not the best choice for breakfast if you are trying to cut out empty carbs and increase whole grain foods.

review/summary: Not impressed with Crunchy Nut Cereal
review/text: kellogg's Crunchy Nut is basically corn flakes coated with sugar and microscopically sized nut pieces.  I can't even taste the nuts on them.<br /><br />My key comments:<br />1)  These are completely void, nutritionally<br />2)  Seems like this should have been another version of Corn Flakes instead of an altogether new cereal.<br />3)  As I alluded to above, they don't even taste particularly good.<br /><br />Overall, a lousy product in my opinion.

review/summary: Deliciously Crunchy--to the Bottom of the Bowl
review/text: I was very impressed with this cereal.  It straddles the line between the healthy and the sweet/sugary.  The result is a phenomenal cereal that both the adults and children in our house were excited to eat.  In fact, my youngest even opted for this over his usual sugar-saturated brand.  Once we were through with the box, he (and I) were actively looking for this item every time we visited the grocery store.  For me, the crowning virtue of this cereal is that it remains crunchy in a bowl of milk.  Whenever I eat cereal, I tend to eat quickly to avoid sogginess.  One morning, I poured my cereal and had to focus on helping the kids with something and only came back to it after several minutes. With most cereals, I would return to a soggy mess that I poured down the drain.  Amazingly, this cereal was still crunchy and delicious.  That--and its exceptional taste--will ensure that I continue to seek out this excellent cereal.

review/summary: Great Alternative to Frosted Flakes
review/text: This cereal does one thing really well -- it stays crunchy in milk.  That, if nothing else, is enough for me to recommend it to anyone who asks.  But it also passes the taste test -- it's good, and it's good without adding sugar (or really anything else; it's good right out of the box!).<br /><br />And it passes the kid test.  My son ate two bowls the day the box arrived, and my daughter has been eating it by the handful.  It's not overly sweet, but it has that honey flavor that lets you eat it without adding anything to it.  The nuts offer a good crunch without being overwhelming, and help the flakes to stay crunchy.  This is going on my shopping list!

At 120 calories for 3/4 of a cup of cereal, it's not a bad nutritional bargain either.  Good for both breakfast, and a lower-cal snack when your sweet tooth comes calling.

review/summary: Great crunch, sweetness and texture.
review/text: I'm a fan of cereals in general, but mostly those with nuts mixed in. However, most of the nutty cereals I've tried have the nuts separated from the flakes. The fact that the Kellog's Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut cereal has crunched peanuts on top of golden milled-corn flakes made it more appealing to me.<br /><br />Eating cereal is a serious ritual for me.  I like to take my time and savor the taste of the cereal as it mixes with the milk while I also get the crunchy sensation after each bite.  I tend to dislike cereals that get soggy too quickly.  In this category I place the original Kellog's Corn Flakes, Honey Bunches of Oats and Raisin Bran among others.  I have to eat these in a hurry if I want to maintain the crunchiness, and they still end up  getting very soft too quickly, leaving you with a disappointing experience.  The longest lasting cereals that I've tried include Honey-Nut Cheerios and Froot Loops, but these tend to float above the milk instead of blending in, so you end up with a lot of extra milk at the bottom.<br /><br />The Crunchy Nut  flakes are coated with a very sweet syrup made out of molasses.  The coating gives a very shiny appearance to the flakes, and while at first glance they seemed soaked in an oily substance, that perception went away after I tasted a few flakes coming out of the box.<br /><br />In terms of texture, Crunchy Nut cereal has the perfect balance.  The flakes are crunchy and very resistant to the milk and they also leave a very nice flavor to it.  I can take my time and savor all the cereal flavors without worrying about soggy flakes at the bottom. The cereal peanuts mixed with the flakes and milk give a very faint taste of Crunch `n Munch and Cracker Jax.  The crunch is very loud, which is a sign of freshness and quality.  Although sweeter than the average cereal, it didn't leave a bad aftertaste or a need to follow up with a glass of cold water, like when I eat the sweeter Froot Loops or Frosted Flakes.<br /><br />In terms of nutritional value, Crunchy Nut has no distinct advantage or disadvantage compared to other cereals.  Corn syrup and molasses are its main sweeteners.  It has 160 calories with skim milk (120 without), 0 cholesterol,  26g of carbs (11g of sugar, 15 of other carbs) and it's a great source of all major vitamins.<br /><br />Taste is simply enjoyable.  It has a very pleasant and familiar sweet taste from the combination of peanuts and molasses that's hard to resist.  It is one of those cereals you can have at any time of the day.  I highly recommend it to those of you who like peanuts and sweet cereals.

review/summary: A little sweet and a little nutty.
review/text: To be honest, I am not a breakfast eater, however, when I want something quick and easy, I tend to pick traditional, plain or simple cereals. My favorites are Corn Flakes (with sliced bananas), or Cheerios (original), but when I want to get fancy, I will settle for Honey Nut Cheerios (which can sometimes be too sweet), Fruit & Fiber, or Raisin Bran. So when "Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut" was offered, I jumped on the opportunity to try it. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised. Each flake offers, a little sweetness (not too much) and a little crunch (not too overwhelming). And even in milk, the flakes stay relatively firm (I don't tend to let my cereal stand for long periods of time. I don't care for soggy cereal) and don't get mushy. I would definitely recommend this cereal for those who enjoy slightly sweet, with a nutty flavor, cereals.

review/summary: Frosted Flake Type Cereal with Bonus Flavors
review/text: This has just the right amount of sweetness and flavor that makes for a delightful breakfast or snack.  The flakes hold their crunch pretty well and there is more flavor there than something like frosted flakes.  I think most people will know that in terms of nutrition, this is not in the league of some Kashi cereals, but most people can read the nutrition information as well. If you are a fan of sweet flake type cereals, this is right up your alley, and you will enjoy it. The nuts are a bonus though over other offerings, and they're not as hard as say some bunches of oats might be.

I was not overly jazzed by the ingredient list either which made me feel like it was not one of the best nutritional choices.  Do your body a favor and make another choice.

review/text: To imagine the flavor, take Frosted Flakes, substitute a honey glaze for the "frosting", and add a few thinly shredded peanuts.  It is still sweet, though a little less sweet than Frosted Flakes.  The peanuts add a light peanut taste along with the corn flakes and honey--no flavor dominates.  If that sounds good to you (like it did to me), then you'll probably love this cereal.  If not, you may be disappointed.

A serving of cereal has only 2g of protein and is loaded with sweeteners;by comparison, Special K has triple the protein and 1/3 the sugar. This cereal is also not that filling.

It is very sugary (11g & second ingredient on the list after milled corn)and about 120 calories per serving (31g or 3/4 cup).  I liked how it stayed crunchy in the milk.  It is not a bad cereal but not really anything over the top exciting.  If you like frosted corn cereals with some peanut slivers infused on the flakes then you will like this.

review/summary: Requested to buy more!
review/text: This morning my husband, one of my granddaughters and I tried this new cereal from Kellogg's, Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut.  All three of us liked the cereal, but the other two liked it a little more than I did.<br /><br />When milk is first poured over the flakes they are, indeed, very crunchy and toothsome.  I liked the fact that I could actually "feel" the peanut pieces on the flakes, as well as see them.  The touch of honey is maybe a little over done for me, but my fellow crunchers didn't agree.  I do think this cereal is a little too sweet, but that may just be my taste preference.  The serving size is given as 3/4 cup for a count of 120 calories.  Pair that with 1/2 cup of fat free milk and you are up to 160 calories.  Certainly not bad numbers except that nobody bothered to stay within the 3/4 cup limit.  The flakes do not, alas, stay crunchy for long in the milk.  After 5 minutes they were almost completely flat and yet still very good.<br /><br />I have been requested to buy this cereal after this box runs out along with another new release, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LC02T2">Crunchy Roasted Honey Nut, 10.8-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>, and since there is a coupon printed on the box I'm sure I will do that.  I think this will end up being one of those things my grandgirls request I have on hand for their sleep over parties.  There was much discussion of how good these would be eaten as a snack without adding the milk to them.  Humm, Granny will have to be vigilant in watching these boxes.

This is just corn flakes with a sprinkling of nuts and a thick coating of glazed sugar. There isn't much fiber in it either so this is basically an unhealthy cereal. The flakes stay crispy because of the thick coating of sugar takes a long time to wear off, I won't be buying this cereal, I like a little sugar with my cereal and NOT a little cereal with my sugar.

It is basically sugar/honey and cornflakes.<br /><br />Caloric count with skim milk is 160 calories for 3/4 of a cup of cereal and 1/2 cup of skim milk--I guess that is pretty average.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad cereal, but I prefer some of the other Kellogg's cereals.

review/text: Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Flakes are in essence Frosted Flakes (sugar glazed corn flakes) covered with peanut fragments.  While I was a bit concerned when the second ingredient listed is sugar, when I checked the nutrition info, there are only 160 calories a bowl with a 1/2 cup of milk.  I know some of Kellogg's "healthy" cereals with more calories.<br /><br />I found Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Flakes to be sweet but not overpowering with a hint of peanuts.  Even in milk they have a good crunch but they can be enjoyed by themselves as well.  I didn't know if the peanuts would work on a breakfast cereal but I was pleasantly surprised at the combination.  People with peanut allergies should avoid this but I think this is one of those cereals that kids and parents can both enjoy.

review/text: As a lover of more hearty cereals like Grape-Nuts, I was a little worried this one might be too sweet.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find that, sure, it reminded me (a lot) of Frosted Flakes, but was better.  It stayed very crunchy in milk (can't say that about the Frosted Flakes I remember), had a nice nuttiness to it - although I can't say I'd necessarily have realized it had nuts if the package hadn't clued me in.  As for healthiness - it's fortified like most cereals these days, but I was definitely hungry again an hour later and wasn't impressed by the protein or fiber content.  Overall a good cereal, but I docked one star for its dubious health value - I'll probably go back to Grape Nuts for daily eating.

review/summary: Another breakfast contender
review/text: As cereals go, there are plenty of choices. I tend to favor plainer ones myself, so the sweetness of the honey taste wasn't the plus for me it might be for someone else. Still, it was not bad. The bits of peanut added an extra tang. The overall effect reminded me of a cross between frosted flakes and Cracker Jacks.<br /><br />As an experiment, I used up the rest of the box by turning it into an impromptu snack bar mix. I melted some marshmallows with a bit of butter over low heat, and stirred in the cereal. (One cup of marshmallows to every 2 cups of cereal). I then took the mix and spread it onto a buttered baking sheet, packing it together. When cooled, I sliced it up into handy-sized servings. The result was tasty, crunchy and a bit more portable.<br /><br />If I were to try the experiment again, I might crunch the flakes down a bit more before mixing in the marshmallows, and try adding things like chocolate chips, butterscotch bits, raisins, craisins (dried cranberry snacks) or combinations of them all.

review/summary: Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut Cereal
review/text: Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut is super-delicious.  The honey coating on the cornflake base has almost a caramelized flavor, and the peanut bits add extra crunch and a little extra protein.  They stay fairly crunchy in milk if you eat them reasonably quickly- in fact, they stay crunchy longer than uncoated flake cereals do, which is a good thing.<br /><br />But the reason I give this cereal just four stars instead of five is that the serving size is 3/4c, and that'll cost you 120 calories, before you even add milk.  3/4c doesn't amount to a lot of this cereal, so to feel satisfied and stay satisfied until lunch or elevensies, (whichever comes first), you'll either have to eat more than 3/4c (and figure on taking in more calories from cereal) or supplement your bowl of cereal with an egg or two, some fruit, a glass of juice, and maybe even a piece of toast.  I know all the cereal companies say to eat their product "as part of a balanced breakfast," but most people I know choose a box of cereal so they can pour their breakfast in a bowl, pour on some milk, bolt the cereal, and get out the door, avoiding fiddling with the egg, fruit, juice, toast, etc.  I have to say, as much as I love the taste of this cereal, I ate the recommended 3/4c for breakfast and didn't even last the hour before I was hungry again.<br /><br />That's not to say all is lost for Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut cereal.  It's also quite delicious if you mix the recommended serving size with a serving of Greek yogurt, either plain or vanilla or sweetened with honey, and the added protein and nutrients you get from the yogurt does make you feel fuller longer than just the cereal-and-milk combo.<br /><br />So yes, this cereal is beyond great-tasting.  It has good crunch, good sweetness- it's like eating candy!  It doesn't disappoint on the taste front.  But plan to supplement with another breakfast food so you're not running for a Snickers Bar by 9 a.m.

review/text: There are so many cereals on the market yet always something new.  When I opened the box my first thought was these smell like Kellogs Corn Pops, very sweet smelling.  As for taste, not really a whole lot of it, its almost like the milk overpowered the taste.  Its kind of somewhere between corn flakes and frosted flakes, like the cereal can't make up its mind to cater to adults or kids.<br /><br />I didn't find them to be particularly crunchy but really don't care too much about that.  The nuts in every bite are so small and I guess are in the flakes if that's what the different color pieces are, didn't see a real nut.  Flakes are shiny with sugar.  I have nothing against sugar and actually have Reese's Puffs sometimes, its just these are marketed as crunchy nut and they aren't really either crunchy or have nuts.  Not as fullfilling as other cereals like Raisin Bran or Special K, you'll need a banana in it.<br /><br />Some pros:  fairly low in calories, again taste is subjective so what's to say.  Some fibre.<br /><br />I wish I could write more but the cereal just doesn't give me any reason to.

review/summary: Relaunching and old favorite
review/text: This looks to be a relaunch of the old, and internationally widely available, Honey Nut Corn Flakes.<br /><br />The name alone should tell you most of what you need to know about this cereal as it aptly describes exactly how this cereal tastes.  Corn Flakes that are sweet with honey and sprinkled with peanuts for a slightly nutty flavor.  I would say this cereal tastes sweeter than most (and definitely sweeter than standard corn flakes ) but is still not as sweet as the traditional Kellogs "kids" cereals, e.g. Frosted Flakes, Fruit Loops, etc.<br /><br />A high quality cereal and recommended for those that would enjoy this flavor combination.

review/summary: Tastes great for what it is
review/text: I personally don't care for overly sweet cereals but this has to be better than some of the kiddie cereals.<br />I found it too sweet and prefer to mix it with an unsweetened high fiber cereal or oats. That takes the sweet edge off.<br />If you have a young one who loves the sugary marshmallow type cereals perhaps this could help with the transition to more adult cereals.<br />If you are trying to cut down on sugar in general this cereal isn't for you.

review/text: Crunchy Nut Crunchy cereal is great. It's very tasty. It's weird because this cereal actually tastes like a variety of sweet flavors. For it example, it sort of tastes like Cracker Jacks to me...lol. If you are one of those people who is into the healthy variety of cereals and are not used to sweet cereals you may not like this. However, if you like me, has a sweet tooth and on occasion delves back into your youth and picks up one those sweet cereals you used to like when you were a kid, this is the cereal for you.

review/summary: Like eating Cracker Jacks for breakfast....
review/text: Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is a cornflake cereal covered with a heavy coating of caramelized sugar and tiny bits of peanuts. I swear it tastes almost exactly like Cracker Jacks - not surprising since the 3 biggest ingredients are corn, sugar, and peanuts - so it is very tasty but not exactly what I generally have in mind for breakfast.<br /><br />Seriously, this cereal makes an addictive snack dry out of the box, but I'd never eat something this sugary first thing in the morning. 11 grams of sugar per serving rivals my kids' sugary breakfast fare! I'll stick with my Honey Bunches of Oats.

review/summary: Crunchier and with more peanut flavor than I expected...
review/text: I'm not a huge cereal nerd having grown up on a steady diet of mostly M&uuml;slix and Kix, with only the occasional box of Trix or Captain Crunch in the cupboard.  Though there are six million varieties of cereal products on the shelves, I pretty much stick to the occasional box of Raisin Bran or Honey Nut Cheerios, but of the brands that I do eat I have some very specific likes and dislikes.  When I picked this box of Crunchy Nut I was skeptical that it would actually deliver on it's namesake, being crunchy and nutty.  For my taste I find that the various nutty cereals usually don't have a  very strong nut taste, and the "crunchy" varieties tend to lose all their bite after a few seconds in milk.<br /><br />Lo and behold my surprise when this Kellogg's brand cereal delivered wholeheartedly on both accounts.  Overall Crunchy Nut has a very similar flavor profile to a box of Cracker Jacks, which in my book is a good thing.  The flakes are well enough coated with honey that they have a bit more life in milk than your typical sweetened flake, though they don't hold up as well to some of the Newman's Own cereal flakes ([[ASIN:B0040GI8YU Newman's Own Cereal - Sweet Enough Vanilla Almond 13oz 6 Pack],which are the king of crunchy in my opinion.)<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed these and would probably put them into my cereal rotation.

review/text: Excellent product: good-tasting , not too sweet, with a pleasant, slightly toasted flavor. The honey-nut coating, as well as tasting nice, seems to form a protective barrier, keeping the flakes crisp right to the last spoonfull. I had to turn off my book-on-tape, as I could not hear it while I ate my cereal.The days of racing to finish one's cornflakes before they turn into a soggy ooze seem to be over at last!

review/summary: Taste BETTER (sweeter) than regular CORN FLAKES & stay CRUNCHY
review/text: I'm not a huge fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6EE88">Kellogg's Frosted Flakes of Corn Cereal, 23-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> because they don't stay crunchy in milk and they leave a bad after taste in your mouth.  But I like these Crunchy flakes, even though there are only nut "specks" that have more of a peanut taste.  The Crunchy flakes taste sweeter and stay crunchier in milk than the frosted flakes.  When I first saw this cereal, I thought it would taste like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6EE92">Oatmeal Crisp Cereal, Chunky Almonds, 17-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)</a> ... but it didn't.  I do like the taste of this cereal, but I prefer more of an almond taste (like General Mills) than a peanut taste (like Kellogg's).  However, I must say that the Kellogg's flakes have slightly less calories than the General Mills Oatmeal Crisp.<br /><br />If you are looking for a "healthy" cereal, this would not be for you ... LOTS of sugar (which I why I guess I like the taste).

review/summary: As a snack, this stuff is addictive! AKA "Dessert Cereal"
review/text: I tried Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal upon arrival as it was snack time. It is truly addictive dry. I love the strong peanut flavor. However, since it is a cereal, I knew I needed to review it as such, so I poured a small bowl & here is the verdict:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It stays crunchy<br />-Great peanut flavor<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Too sweet for a cereal. I do not like my milk to get sweet while I'm eating a cereal & with this the milk got really sweet right away. I wouldn't drink the milk if my life depended on it. It would make your teeth curl!<br /><br />I won't be buying this as a cereal. It is waaaaaaaaay too sugary to start the day with it. I might pack the remainder of the cereal up in Ziplock bags for the kids as a junky snack because it does have more health benefits than, say, a candy bar because of all the added vitamins. But I won't go out and purchase it on my own.<br /><br />06/21/11 UPDATE: In lieu of full disclosure, I have to admit that I've purchased this twice in our grocery store since trying the Amazon sample. I use it as a snack when we want something sweet but don't want to make a dessert snack. So as sugary sweet as it is, I have to admit to this being a guilty, junky pleasure once in while. I do love the strong peanut flavor.

review/summary: How does it stay crunchy?
review/text: First, Crunchy Nut is not health food. It is instead the wonderfully sweet flakes, vastly improved since my childhood.<br /><br />Second, food science has discovered the technique to retain crunchiness that persists throughout the entire milk saturated serving. It is a remarkable achievement and every bit as significant as E=mc2 to the consumer.<br /><br />I love this stuff. My wife hates it. She is in to 'healty eating'. Husbands will need to buy Crunchy Nut when we get the rare opportunity to shop unsupervised.<br /><br />As to the effect on the g-kids? I pre-tested it for you g-parents out there. Oh Yes! They love their g-pa.

Crunchy, but not like granola crunchy which is good, tasty, tasty is always good and the big questions, do you want more? and would you eat it again? Two big resounding yes's, to those 2 questions.

I eat it from the box as a snack, instead of chips or cookies, and it's very satisfying. The flakes are thick and honey coated. My 4 year old likes it a lot with milk, and he's fussy about his cereal. I will buy it again, but more for a special treat rather than a daily breakfast.

review/summary: Variations on a corn flake theme
review/text: Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut is a corn flake cerial with added peanut crumbs, glued on by honey. The peanut flavor is quite noticeable at first, but less so as you get further into eating it. The flakes are smaller than those of "Frosted Flakes", but still with a light texture. It is fairly sweet, with 11 grams of sugar per serving. I enjoyed it. The easiest way to describe the cerial is that it is like "Frosted Flakes", but with added peanut flavor. There are only a relatively small number of basic ingredients that cerial companies work with and ways to combine them, and this is a pleasant variation on the corn flake theme.

review/summary: Sweet and Crunchy
review/text: This is sweet and crunchy cereal as advertised, with crunchy flakes and pieces of nuts on the sweetened flakes. They taste good enough that they make you want more - which can be both good news and bad news! It's a crunchy crunch, but it's more of a gentle crunch - I did not worry that fillings would fall off.<br /><br />Nutrition wise this is somewhere in the middle, however, if you are willing to make a compromise these can be great: instead of filling up the bowl with only Crunchy Nut, mix Crunchy Nut with some of the less sugary cereal like Special K, Cheerios, Total, or other nutritionally desirable cereal, and play with the portions to your liking. This also helps reduce the overall sweetness, since these are indeed sweet!

review/summary: Tastes like Frosted Flakes with a honey nut flavor
review/text: This cereal tastes very good - similar to Frosted Flakes with a distinct honey and nut "flavor" although I didn't really taste the peanuts because the peanut flakes on the cereal are so small.<br /><br />I consider Crunchy Nut more like a dessert cereal than a good-for-you-type cereal because of all the sugar and high fructose corn syrup in the ingredients even though it's fortified with lots of Vitamins (A, C, Iron, D, etc.).  It's 120 calories for a 1.1 oz serving without milk.<br /><br />For me, Crunchy Nut has a 5 star taste with 3-1/2 star ingredients.

review/summary: Yummy, but not for those watching their diet
review/text: Crunchy Nut, Golden Honey Nut does a good job describing the flavor.  I like to eat my cereal dry so I got a good look at the sweetend flakes.  The nuts are nearly ground up and attached to the flakes but not every flake has nuts on them so it tastes more like honey than peanuts.  A serving is only a 3/4 cup which isn't much if you meassure it out.

review/text: This is a delicious sweetened corn flake cereal, very crispy.  The ground peanut granules are visible on the flakes. However, I could not taste any trace of peanut flavor, or notice any courser texture, due to the granules' presence.  That said, it still tasted very good.  The four stars are due to the lack of nut-perception, when it is a prominent part of the name of the product.

review/summary: Frosted Flakes in disguise
review/text: At first, I absolutely loved it!  It was like eating Frosted Flakes but with a more healthier side...or so I thought. It is very crunchy and has a nut cluster in every flake.  The taste is very sweet indeed.  As I went to Kellogg's website, I found a very shocking discovery:  The nutritional labels of Crunchy Nut and Frosted Flakes are almost identical!  It is they almost trying to fool adults into thinking they are eating a healthy alternative to Frosted Flakes.  Therefore it is pretty much just like Frosted Flakes but with a slightly different texture.  For the health conscious:  It has 120 calories, 26 grams of carbs(9% DV) and 11 grams of sugar per serving. A 14.1 oz box contains approximately 13 servings.  Another fine product from Kellogg's, but still too much sugar.

review/summary: Sweet and Crunchy
review/text: The Kellogg's Crunchy Nut (Golden Honey Nut) is indeed very crunchy.  It is also very sweet as other reviews have acknowledged.  In fact, its ingredient list is: (1) milled corn, (2) sugar, (3) peanut, (4) honey.... etc.  Having sugar ranks as the number 2 ingredient, you know there is a lot of sugar.  To put it in another way, in one serving size of 31 gram of this cereal, 11 gram of it is pure sugar.<br /><br />I really like this cereal.  It tastes sweet and delightful, and it is very very crunchy and stay fairly crunchy in the milk, just don't kid yourself in thinking this is a superhealthy food.<br /><br />While I do like this cereal, I don't think it is out of the world, so I am giving it a 4-star rating for being good, but not great.

review/summary: Crunchy
review/text: Four and half stars really, but I rounded up. My family eats a lot of cereal. I'm a Cheerios lover from childhood, my daughter generally prefers the chocolate cereals and my son loves Honey Nut Cheerios.<br /><br />So I poured each of us a bowl. A very small one for me since it's very easy for things to taste too sweet to me.<br />It's very crunchy. The milk doesn't seem to affect it at all in the time it takes to eat a bowl and it is very sweet. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it tastes a lot sweeter than the calories suggest. The honey taste is pretty faint. The peanut taste is just right<br />.<br />The reason I gave it five stars is that my kids loved it. Both of them thought it was just wonderful and it became their new favorite cereal. Since both are older, it's not a fickle decision on their part. My son's previous favorite had been his favorite for the last 10 years.<br /><br />It was too sweet for my tastes.I think it would make a great cracker crust or topping for a fruit crumble.<br />I think for future servings of cereal, I'll mix it with regular corn flakes to help cut the sweet a bit.

It's a little sweet for me as a daily cereal and it doesn't have the vitamin value of my regular cereal,  Total Raisen Bran, but will make a nice change from my daily routine.  It tastes great right out of the box as a snack.  NOTE: It does contain peanuts for those of you that are allergic to them.

review/summary: A sweet pleasant taste
review/text: Doing a food item is always difficult, individual taste and preference being a major reason why we like or dislike something.  Breakfast cereal might be one of the more difficult items.  Having written disclaimers, here is my review.<br />This is a heavily sweetened item with 120 calories in � of a cup.  In addition, there are peanut chips stuck to the flakes.  Honey and molasses are the major sweeteners.  The result is a corn flake with peanut slivers and honey that has a sweet pleasant taste.  The flakes hold up well in milk or can be eaten dry as a snack.  I think this would make an excellent base for a sweet trail mix snack.  My two-year old grandson likes them dry in his dish as a snack.<br />This might be an alternate to the heavily sugar sweeten cereals but is not a good choice for anyone looking to control their weight.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: To set the stage - I like cereal.  A lot.  :)  I tend to eat "healthy" cereals for breakfast, but I also like to get my sweet on from time to time.  I put these corn flakes squarely into the "sugar cereal" category, but you can judge the nutritional facts listed below for yourself.  They're very low in fat and not too high in calories.  I've eaten a bowl at each of the past five meals, sometimes for dessert.  Seriously, these aren't a bad choice for a relatively low calorie and low fat dessert.<br /><br />Taste:<br />To quote Adam Richman of Man v. Food, "Oh, my goodness.  Ooooh, my goodness."  To help explain, from the moment that I opened the box and smelled the cereal, and through the first five bowls, I kept trying to figure out which candy these reminded me of.  Yes, _candy_.  That was the first thing that popped into my head, and it never left.  I think that I figured it out - Kathryn Beich Golden Crumbles (a fund raising candy during my childhood days in Illinois, with peanut butter coated in a candy shell).  Those were probably my favorite candy growing up, so it's no surprise that I like this cereal.<br /><br />As the name suggests, these taste like honey and nuts.  They are very sweet, IMO, but in a good way.  Oh, such a good way.<br /><br />Texture:<br />With the sugar coating, these corn flakes have a nice crunch to them and stay crunchy for longer in milk than regular corn flakes.  I haven't had any issues with them getting soggy, but I normally finish a bowl in well under five minutes.<br /><br />Nutrition:<br />At the time of this review, the ingredients are listed on Amazon, but the nutritional facts aren't.  So, I'll put them here and let you decide for yourself if it's what you want for breakfast (or whenever).  I like that they are low in fat and (relatively) low in calories, and I'm not bothered by the sugar level.  I wish that they didn't have high fructose corn syrup, but dang - did I mention that they're delicious? :)<br /><br />Facts for dry cereal (no milk):  Serving size = 3/4 cup, calories = 120, total fat = 1g (no saturated or trans fat), cholesterol = 0mg, sodium = 160mg, potassium = 40mg, total carbs = 26g (dietary fiber &lt; 1g, sugars = 11g), protein = 2g<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />If you like sugar cereals, honey, and nuts - then I highly recommend giving these a try if you can find them for about $3-$3.50 a box or less.  $5/box (the price that Amazon had last week) is a bit steep, IMO.

review/text: After trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CYLW7A">Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey, 10.8-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and liking it, I was looking forward to trying the flake version next. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. First of all, I could not believe how sweet this was! I could practically feel my teeth rotting away, and though it only has one more gram than the "O" cereal (11 grams to O's 10), it was far sweeter. Adding to the con list is that this particular cereal uses high fructose corn syrup in addition to sugar and honey and has next to no fiber at all (less than 1 gram according to the box). As for the pros, you can definitely taste the honey and hint of nut and it stays crunchy for a while. Yes, it has some vitamins and minerals, but on the whole, I will never get this again and can only eat it mixed with an unsweetened cereal. Since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044CPA28">Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut, 14.1-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> is basically a waste of calories, I cannot recommend this unless you want a "dessert" cereal.
