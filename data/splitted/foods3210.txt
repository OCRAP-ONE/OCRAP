review/summary: andes peppermint crunch
review/text: I was just going to write YUM! but it says it needs to be more than 20 words.  So then I was going to write YUM! 20 times, but then it said repeated words don't count.  SoI guess I will have to say the the white chocolate in conjunction with the crunchy peppermint is such a delicious combination.  I wish they didn't just sell this at Christmas time. I would purchase it year round.

review/summary: Amazing jelly...
review/text: I actually have local stores order this jelly and many of the other Aloha jellies for my family. I order 12 - 20 jars at a time and still, we covet and hoard it like it's gold. The slight peppery tanginess combined with the sweet smooth jelly adds a kick to the top of baked Brie (form tinfoil around the bottom and sides of the Brie, slice off the top of the Brie, add a good layer of jelly, bake in a 400 degree oven for 20 - 30 min - until you can see the jelly bubbling on top), takes bread and jelly to heaven (just bread with cheese broiled and topped with jelly), or and makes any piece of chicken or pork (put on before or after you bake it) the most delicious foods you'll taste in a long time.<br /><br />The only reason this jelly doesn't get a 5 star from me is that the cost, with shipping, is high. If you order from their Aloha website, you have to order 3 at a time but the shipping goes down substantially.<br /><br />Or, once you have tried a few of them, and offered them at dinner parties, you'll find yourself twisting the arms of your local stores to ship them in for you, your family, and your newly loyal friends!

review/summary: Not sour but tart and quite delicious
review/text: C. Howard Company has been around since 1934, when Mr. Howard formed it in New York City to sell his violet mints. Actually, due to the quirky way he wrote his signs, it has been "Choward Violet Mints" ever since then!<br /><br />As time went on, Mr. Howard decided to expand his product line, and among the other flavors he developed was his lemon candy. This delicious candy is sweetly lemony, not sour but tart and quite delicious - like a lemon meringue pie. I really like the taste of these candies, and I highly recommend them!

review/text: If you are hoping for a cheaper, bulk version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTPAE4">Village Harvest Organic Brown Thai Jasmine Rice, 30-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, this is not it.  While better than ordinary brown rice, the fragrance and texture of Village Harvest is far superior and worth the additional cost.<br /><br />Very sad update (August 20, 2012) (3 stars to 1 star)<br /><br />We discovered the source of the dozens of little brown moths flying all over the house.  Unfortunately, they came from this bag of rice, which we didn't realize until we had reached the bottom of the bag.  I have had issues like this with brown rice purchased from Asian grocery stores before but not with brown rice from American groceries.  Either way, it's not a good thing.

review/summary: wouldnt buy again
review/text: The rice arrived in a paper bag inside a cardboard box. There was no protection against moisture or occasional liquid spills on the bag during transit. They could have put a plastic cover over the paper bag. I dont know how it was stored in the warehouse it came from. I still went ahead and opened the packet as I had completely run out of rice and I eat rice atleast once a day. The rice had a mix of some other grain!! (I could not recognize what the grain was). I can say that grain accounted for maybe 4-5% of the total bag volume. I wouldnt mind if it was rice bran, better than having polished rice. On cooking the rice becomes real thick, not long grained. Smell on cooking is like normal rice, nothing like jasmine rice. Wont buy again. Would like to mention that shipping was fast.

review/summary: Pure molten lava
review/text: Ok, so if you are looking for something thats going to raise the heat level of anything you are eating, this is it. I had used some Pure Cap (500,000 SHU) and I had to still add 10-20 drops into whatever I was eating to raise the food to the heat level where I am sweeting and nervously tapping my leg as I eat. With Mad Dog 357, I only needed one drop. I put one drop in my cup of noodles last night and I would not have added another.<br /><br />If you are the kind of person who either cant really taste the heat anymore, or have to add so much hot sauce that your food tastes like hot sauce instead of the actual food, then this is for you. Instantly add copious amounts of heat to your food without augmenting the flavor, I recommend purchasing an eye dropper to dole this stuff out and make sure you wash your hands. My forehead was burning for an hour last night because I used my fingers to wipe the sweat from my brow (after I washed them mind you).<br /><br />Anyway, get this is you are a pepper nut and like excess.

review/summary: HOT!!!
review/text: I can handle very hot stuff but WOW! this stuff is strong, the guy above me who said use the  eye dropper was smart i shouldve listened to him, this stuff isnt a joke, its not something to let anyone eat straight from the bottle its just too hot. it should be used as a food additive only. the reason i say that you need an eye dropper is because it is incredibly runny and you dont want to put in more than you can handle, it has an incredible flavor, i used 1 small drop of the 357 mad dog pepper extract and a pinch of crushed naga jolokia into a 5 pound pot of chili and had to drain some of the heat out of it (which is incredibly difficult) and it still stayed pretty hot. its very good and very hot use with caution

review/summary: Fire in a bottle
review/text: I have a rather exceptional tolerance for capsaicin but this product defeated me. Definitely the hottest product/substance which I've ever consumed. This literally makes habaneros seem like bell peppers. Will my idiot friends and I consume it straight in a proverbial dick measuring contest? Yes! Will we suffer in agony and literally experience stomach bleeding? Yes! Aside from such naughty escapades, I really will use this as a food additive. A mere 1.7 Oz may not sound like much but I anticipate this product lasting me a couple of years and I eat a lot of hot foods.<br /><br />I really must echo the sentiments of the other posters with regards to the eye dropper. If Mad Dog had incorporated an eye dropped into the cap it would have really improved the functionality of the product. I almost rated the product 4 stars due to that short coming. Pouring it directly onto food is ridiculous. I'm very happy with the product overall. The eye dropper, or lack there of, is my only complaint.

review/summary: The Hottest. Period.
review/text: There is no reason to purchase this product. It is far too hot. I can handle a few drops of the 1 Million Scoville in whatever, but this is just too hot. One drop into 16 oz of chili and I was unable to tolerate it at all. I ate half of the cup of chili, pushing through the pain of a phantom hot coal on your tongue until I threw in the towel. I was defeated. I gave it away after its first use. I was not okay for half an hour, and that wasn't even the worst part of what ultimately becomes of eating anything.<br />If you want to say you have had the hottest, this is it. Have it once and you wont want anything to do with it ever again, I promise.

review/summary: Hot!
review/text: This is ridiculously hot, but well worth the money.  Before, to add a little heat to chili, nacho cheese, tacos, or whatever else I like to have hot, I had to add some kind of hot sauce.  However, no matter how hot whatever I was using was, by the time I added enough in to bring the heat up, it's all I could taste!  With this, I can make my chili as hot or mild as I want, and still have it taste like chili.  And because I only use a few drops at a time, this stuff will last me forever!  To some, it may seem expensive for a small bottle of what they think is hot sauce, but it is so much more!

review/text: Will purchase from vendor if need to in the future! I'm happy with the purchase. The delivery was quicker than expected and everything came undamaged (the machine was packaged with a lot of protection!)<br /><br />I thought that the reverse spiral would be a fun thing for kids (and adults!) to watch, but the short travel distance from the top of the spiral to the bottom of the spiral is just to short to get the necessary action.  Next time, I'll just get the single direction spiral.<br /><br />I did email the vendor and stated it would be great if they had a video of the machine in action... maybe I'll shoot one and update this review with it.<br /><br />In the end, I'm happy with the machine and happy with the vendor. It looks great and the kids eyes light up when they see it!  I have noticed and increase in gum sales since putting this unit in.

I won't purchase again; unfortunately, I ordered too much so I have to use it, but not often.  I am sure like most rice it will keep for a long time.

review/summary: Good Halloween candy
review/text: You need to be careful of the source as the quality depends a lot on the shipper.  I usually order these by the mini-case.  Shippers will not guaratee against breakage if you order single boxes.  Mini-cases usually have special packing (I order from Bulk Foods and have never had trouble with breakage).  The better shippers will also ship with blue ice packs for an added charge (the blue ice packs can be reused).  Prices vary depending on the source.  Ordering by the mini-case, you can usually get a discounted price and free shipping, but you have to check around among the sources.<br /><br />The candy sticks themselves are the best variety that I have found.  The individual wrappers are all marked with the flavors.  Flavors are comparable with candy sticks from other manufacturers.  You can order specific flavors (orange, bubble gum, cotton candy, etc., depending on the source).  Orange is a good color for Halloween, or you can order red (cherry) and green (lime) for Christmas colors, or possibly the barber pole peppermint sticks.<br /><br />A mini-case may sound like a lot, but friends can combine orders.  Personally, I had about 400 trick or treaters last Halloween, and two sticks per child gives them a little variety and makes a good treat.  I ordered a mini-case of 12 boxes, gave one box to a merchant friend for her store, and had a few left for Christmas (they are colorful and can be used in stockings, gift bags, or added as ornaments to wrappings).

review/summary: castelas extra virgin olice oil
review/text: As a retired ex chef, i am continueing to search for quality and value. In the past i have always found that<br />italian evoo was the best, however i've found one of the worlds best olive oil from france.<br />Is has a slighty grass like taste, "the terrior", and the most wonderfull fruit taste, i have ever had.<br />In florence italy recentley, i attended the olive oil symposium and i brought back some wonderfull unfiltered<br />evoo and along with 6 other major chef friends of mine, we compared taste, color,and value , and i threw in<br />the castelas extra virgin olive oil, and five out of six picked castelas, which was 75% cheaper.<br />Need i say more.<br />This is not a cooking oil, but simply the best topping oil for salads i have ever had, bar none. This is<br />a finisher for all dishes.

review/text: First Nordic Ware cake I made that was not real tasty & was very dry. Made this one in my black Nordic Ware Pan, the baking time could have been cut back by 15 minutes. If that doesn't work, then its in the mix. I have on occasion tried some of the other flavors & they were  delicious. I always cut my heat back 25 degrees with Nordic Ware Pans so that was not the problem.

review/text: My cat is a rescued feral who has some gum and intestinal issues left over from his humble beginnings.  He loves the taste of these treats.  Unlike many kinds of cat food and treats, the Greenies do not give him gas or diarrhea.  And his mouth and coat (he is is a meticulous groomer) smell less like a dumpster.  Good for him.  Good for us.

review/text: My cat Hudson is not the most particular cat in the world.  Weighing in at 19 pounds (which is normal for his breed, a Ragdoll), he's no stranger to food and isn't very finicky.  I don't know what is in these treats, but he just goes crazy for these things, much more so than his other treats.  (I wonder if there's cat nip in these, must go check the label!).<br /><br />Only regret is that they were originally $2.99 on Amazon and have steadily increased in price.<br /><br />Hudson highly recommends these, just don't buy so many that Amazon runs out and poor Hudson has to find something else to eat!

review/summary: decent, but not as "dental" as I expected
review/text: I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. Also the only breath freshening ingredients- rosemary and chlorophyll, are at the very tail end of the ingredient list as dead last and third to last. I am glad that these ingredients are present, but they are in such small quantities, that they can't be helping much. From personal experience, I have not noticed and breath freshening results. I think the only reason why they are "dental" treats is because of the small amount of rosemary and chlorophyll as well as the fact that they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. If your looking for a real dental treat I would recommend Crunch n' Clean with DentaShield. However, this is still a MUCH better treat than Pounce brand or Meow Mix or any soft treat that can have soft sticky particles that will stay stuck to your cats teeth and smell bad and cause dental problems. This treat may not help teeth significantly, but they definitely won't hurt them and probably do some good; just not as much as I expected for the price. Also there are tuns of vitamin in these, which is pretty cool. They really are pretty decent treats, and I would probably give them 5 stars if they were just treats. However, to be marketing them as "dental," they really should have enzymes or more prevalent dental ingredient.

One of my cats was called "dumpster kitty" by her previous owner because her breath was so stinky (and thus her fur smelled awful too). This has cured the problem, and these treats are also great for training. Definitely making this a regular purchase.

review/summary: My Cats LOVE These Greenies!
review/text: My little sister cats are very finicky, and they absolutely LOVE every flavor of Greenies.  The ingredients are all natural, and the extra vitamin B-1 helps as a flea and tick repellent...REALLY!  B-1, or thiamin, builds up with everyday consumption, and it causes an unpleasant odor to emit from the skin that is only detectable by biting insects.  It works on humans as well as animals.  GOOOOD STUFF!!

review/summary: Greenies is a TREAT, not a dental/oral product!
review/text: First, my cat loves this treat.  However, it is definitely not a dental product as the manufacturer advertised.  There is no enzyme in Greenies that would promote dental health.  The size of the treat is pretty standard compares to other brands of cat treats, so there is no need for the cat to chew on it (my cat swallows it in 2 seconds), which means Greenies does not "brush off" the tartar either.  I took my cat to the vet few months ago for professional dental cleaning.  After the treatment, the vet gave me some handouts about dental care for cats, and explained to me that Greenies does NOT promote dental care.  Instead, the vet recommends the CET chews for cats.  However, the vet says, nothing beats brushing your cat's teeth at least every other day.  So, if you are looking for an oral hygiene chews, look somewhere else, however, if you just want to please your cat, Greenies does make a tasty treat!

review/text: We recently adopted an older cat who is very pick about her food and treats since she's been eating the same ones for a very long time. I recently purchased some new healthier treats for her and gave her a little taste test. I lined the various treats up in front of her, and this was the one she selected. She seems to prefer the crunchy treats over the soft ones, and while I thought she might like the fish flavored treats the best, she seems to be a big fan of beef. I will keep purchasing these for her. Very happy that I found something healthier for her that she likes.

Like some other reviewers noted, she goes nuts after eating Greenies: very playful and kitten-like, not to mention the constant "talking" to us (it HAS to be "thank you!").  Although, it should be noted that the 3oz pkg is $2.99 at PetSmart... much cheaper if you buy lots of these.

review/summary: Love at First Bite
review/text: My 4 year old cat's first experience with these went as follows.  I put two greenies on the windowsill where he was busy munching oat grass (a constant in my house); he sniffed the greenies; gobbled them crunch, crunch, crunch, gone; then looked for more for the next 15 minutes.  I think that counts as a success.  He likes them even better than he does catnip, which he really likes.  Will they keep his teeth cleaner?  I don't know because his teeth are in pretty good condition either because of his young age, the oat grass or the cat chewy toys I give him.  But he goes to the vet every year for a check up and I will keep track and report back.

review/summary: Don't do it.
review/text: Greenies addiction is very real. The treats are nutritious and any cat will go bonkers over them. The downside is that your cat may very well stop eating his regular food. My cat litterally begs for Greenies and even wakes me up when I'm sleeping. When I don't give him any, he goes off and mopes until he decides to try again. This whole issue has caused a lot of tension in our relationship, and I've decided to just go cold turkey. I just cancelled a $60 order of the treats. I want back my cat that loves me ... not the one who goes through the motions until I break down and give him treats. He no longer displays real affection.<br /><br />Many, many people give their cats these treats, but do some searching online and you will see stories similar to mine. They don't call it "kitty crack" for nothing.<br /><br />Best of luck.

review/summary: No jasmine scent, tasted like Dragonwell tea instead
review/text: I really wanted some Monkey King jasmine tea.  Didn't like the Numi one I bought from Amazon, so I tried this one.  This one tastes and looks like Dragonwell tea (lung jing) but not the 'Monkey King Jasmine' that I had in a restaurant which was beautifully and delicately infused with Jasmine aroma!  This was a sweet tea with NO JASMINE flavor or scent At All.  Dragonwell is not a cheap tea, so this is not a bad tea, just NOT what I wanted!!  Guess I'll just have to drive far out to that restaurant to buy it.<br /><br />I'm not crazy about the packaging either.  The tin can is pretty and there 's a ribbon that goes around it and secured with stickers.  Inside, there's a tin cover that fits the can, but the seal is NOT airtight, no plastic bag or bag at all inside.  It's good if you like to go green.

review/text: Our 2 fussy cats seem to love this product. They actually on a raw diet, mostly ocean fish, and this one fits into a category "Little Healthy Supper Snack" pretty well! Even our 3rd cat who hates any fish and prefers ground beef only (highest grade possible) started to munch on it recently, we were pretty amazed. I'll definitely stock up on it. Price is about the same like in a supermarket in general, but I didn't find this particular fish there. And here it's free shipping with Prime - delivered to your door. Convenient, and I am happy that my cats love it, it's so hard to please these fussy guys.

review/summary: Finally settled my dog's stomach!
review/text: I have a young Siberian Husky who recently developed an allergy to the feed he's been eating since he was a puppy. This was a natural, no-corn, no-grain food, so I was pretty surprised to say the least. We had a couple of weeks of headaches ruling out parasites or other intestinal problems to figure out the cause of his chronic loose stools. After resorting to Dr. Google, I decided to give Pro Plan Sensitive a try. The change was DRAMATIC. Within a few days, my dog's stool firmed up and has been fine and regular since... sure beats having to get up three times a night for a poor dog with an upset stomach and unpredictable bowel movements! If you're having similar problems and have ruled out other medical causes (which you should always do, especially if your dog has a tendency to eat things he is not supposed to), I recommend you give this feed a try. We have a wagging tail and a happy tummy that agrees!

For only a few dollars more I can get a grain free salmon dog food made in the usa not by one of these huge dog food companies that tend to have recalls all the time. If your on a strict budget this is a great food for dogs, but I want better for mine so I'm switching to Taste of the Wild dog food.

I had him for 2 months and really had no idea what to do.<br /><br />I switch him over to Purina Pro Plan Sensitive skin and Stomach just to see if that would help. I am surprise at  the result. It is like having a new dog. He no long makes sounds or throw up. If he drinks water to fast he coughs but, other then that this food has fixed his issues.<br /><br />I highly recommend this if your dog has issues eating they may just need a different diet.

review/summary: great for dogs with.sensitive stomaches
review/text: I have a yorkie/Maltese and she is very sensitive to food. She was under weight and had rashes from regular dog food. She would throw up some and had runny poop. I tried this product as well as some higher priced products for a month each and then decided on this one due to the results and price. Bonnie puppy is now a healthy weight and her skin rash has cleared up. Highly recommended for any pet with digestive problems and or skin issues. Maltese breeds have highly sensitive systems so if u are having digestive system problems then u should read up on your breed and see if it is a food allergy.  This product worked for my brothers Maltese as well that was underweight. Ended up being a digestion issue.

review/summary: Top quality marmalade
review/text: My family loves this marmalade and it is hard to find in stores, even ones that carry other Bonne Maman products. It is not the sweet mush that could be jam of any flavor.  It tastes like orange and actually has plenty of orange zest/rind in it.  Very flavorful.  I was thrilled to see it on Amazon.  The price was hardly more than in the stores including shipping.  It was carefully packed with each jar surrounded by bubble wrap and whipped promptly.  As I buy more and more items on the internet (probably 40% of my purchases) I am thrilled to find I can get the special foods we love.

review/summary: Not the real thing
review/text: We've bought this on numerous occasions while on vacation in France. It is blended for the children of France (low bitterness) and since I lived overseas in a French colony as a child, I think I know whereof I speak. Most French adults would never use a "confiture" (jam) like this on their morning croissant. Perhaps on their tartine (toast=biscuit). But most skip breakfast except for coffee, and that is how they stay skinny--altho their kids are porking up just like us, in record time. So I guess the upshot of this is, that Bonne Maman is OK if that is all you can get, but do try others.<br /><br />As a direct experiment, we got some of our usual favorite Dundee's Orange Marmalade [British, and more bitter] at a British grocery shop in Rome. We then drove to France, and conducted tasted tests. Dundee's is the adult taste. And yes, we are porking up too.<br /><br />One final point: Trader Joe here stopped selling Dundee during the recession, and substituted something else. I finally chunked the second jar of the other, and ordered some Dundee's off the web. Perhaps there are other orange marmalades that are better, but I keep trying others from time to time, and have not found any. [You would think that the Spanish, home to the Seville orange, could do better, eh?]<br /><br />Cheerio all...

I used this brand while living in England and have never found another product that could match the taste and texture of Bonne Maman.  This is true orange marmalade, sweet and full of zest.  There's a reason Bonne Maman is the number one selling line of preserves.  It costs a bit extra, but it's worth every penny.  Once you've tried this marmalade you'll never want the run of the mill brands again.

review/text: These are good enough to eat, but they lack the cheese-y flavor that other cheddar crackers have.  Definitely not Cheez-its flavor-wise, but these crackers are at least all natural AND lower in fat and calories than Cheez-its.<br /><br />In short, they're fine to eat, but don't think you're getting the same taste as Cheez-its.  Also, the expiration month isn't that far from purchase date.  Bought mine end of April 2010 and the expiration is July 2010.  Something to take into consideration when you're buying such a large quantity of these (make sure you have enough people to eat them up :).  If all else fails, we can always use these for 'snack duty' with soccer games or scouts.

review/text: Arizona Southern Sweet Tea is the WORST stuff!  My wife mistakenly bought it for me thinking it was my favorite (which is Red Di@mond).  After one sip, I threw out the entire jug.  They claim it is "brewed" - it isn't.  This stuff tastes like instant, and even though it claims to have no lemon, it does have a lemon taste.  Being from the deep south, I can tell you no no southerner would use instant.  What's most amazing is I cannot understand why this brand of tea is so popular.
