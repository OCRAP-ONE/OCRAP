review/summary: Can't recommend
review/text: I have concerns with this product that would prevent me from buying.  It has more calories and sugar than regular coke and was much too sweet for my taste.  The strawberry flavor was not subtle but had a "bite".  All this might be OK if it tasted terrific; however, it doesn't to me at all.  It tastes sort of candyish--or like someone carbonated strawberry jelly. And it costs almost a dollar a can....

review/summary: OK flavor, but is it really healthier?
review/text: Yes, it's all natural (no artifical flavors, colors, etc.).  Yes, it has added vitamin C.  But this stuff has a LOT of calories and carbs in a single 8.3 oz. serving:  140 calories, 36g carbs.  Fruit juice naturally has a LOT of sugar, and this drink is made from a concentrated fruit juice, reconstituted with "filtered sparkling water" (per the ingredients label).<br /><br />By way of comparison, per nutritional info on the Coca Cola website, an 8 oz serving of Coca Cola classic has 97 calories and 27g carbs; Cherry Coke has 104 calories and 28g carbs per 8 oz serving.  Their Fanta line of fruit-flavored soft drinks comes closest to this in nutritional values: around 120 calories and 30-35g carbs per 8 oz. serving.<br /><br />So you decide -- if you're trying to lose weight or need to limit sugars, this may not work for you.<br /><br />That said, the flavor of this is quite good.  I could definitely taste strawberry, but not the watermelon so much.  I could *smell* the watermelon, but it didn't come through in the flavor of the drink.  The primary flavor I tasted was pear -- odd, because there's no pear juice in the drink (it contains apple, grape, and acerola).  The amount of carbonation was just fine for my taste -- not as "fizzy" as other sodas, but not "flat," either.<br /><br />The small size of the can, while cute, left me wanting more.  I could easily see myself downing two of these with a meal -- thereby doubling the calories/sugars.<br /><br />I would give this 4 stars for the flavor and 2 stars for value -- giving it a 3-star overall rating.  I think it's overpriced for what you get, especially when you can buy frozen fruit juice concentrates and reconstitute your own fizzy fruit drinks using bottled carbonated water for far less; not as convenient, maybe, but definitely more economical.

review/summary: 100% fruit juice sounds healthier than soda...
review/text: but here's a comparison of Switch vs a Classic Cola<br />Serving Size: 8.3 / 12 fl oz<br />Calories: 140 / 140<br />Carbs: 36g / 39g<br />Sugars: 35g / 39g<br />But on the plus side Switch does get you your 100% RDA of Vitamin C so I guess if your kids don't like normal juice this could be a sneak attack option.<br /><br />Now I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the drink, just don't get pulled into the it's 100% natural so it must be good for me.<br />I felt the taste was just right, not being too sweet and the carbonation gives it a little something more than if it were a regular fruit drink.<br />I'm probably a little biased toward liking it as I enjoy sparkling juices anyway. But it's not something I would keep in the house but more of something I'd pick up as a single can while in a convenience store.

review/summary: Sugar is sugar
review/text: If you're of a mind that sugar is sugar, then even if it's derived from pure fruit, 29 grams is a lot for an 8.3 ounce serving.  When I bought it, I thought the carbonation would provide the right dilution. Couldn't tell from the product description.  Some brands do the job at about 8-10 grams which seems about the maximum sweetness if quenching thirst while enjoying some flavor is the goal.  The "Switch" flavors, however, are tasty enough, but the sugar is about the same as a serving of Coke.

review/summary: Nice change from soda and juice
review/text: This drink is nice if you're looking for something a little different than juice or soda - it's kind of a cross between the two.  It's much sweeter and more soda-like than other carbonated juices I've tried, but not totally like soda either.  The nice twist is that it has your 100% DRV of vitamin C which is something you certainly won't find in soda.<br /><br />It was almost border-line too sweet, but because it's a fairly small reasonable portion (compared to a can of soda) it wasn't to the point where I didn't want to finish the drink.  I would like to try some of the other flavors and see if I like them better than this one - I've heard the Black Cherry one is really good.

review/text: What a wonderful alternative to Soda!!!  Switch is a delicious fruity drink, that taste like juice, but have the "feel" of a soda.  I often want a carbonated beverage to settle my stomach, but hate the sugar usually associated with regular sodas.  (I never really got into diet sodas.)  Switch is a wonderful alternative.  It's pure juice, but with that slight carbonated feel of a soda.  I love it and so do my kids. I wish that they would sell it at sports events, but unfortunately they do not.  Trust me.  You can't go wrong with a Switch beverage.

I didn't really think the watermelon strawberry tasted like watermelon or strawberry, but it was a really nice, pleasant flavor. The carbonation was just right. I also liked that this drink didn't leave a weird aftertaste or a lingering flavor on the tongue like some other sodas or juice drinks. This had a very clean flavor that was very refreshing.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: I opened my first can of The Switch, a Watermelon Strawberry flavor, with no expectations of really finding anything different from any other juice drink.<br /><br />At best, I assumed it would be drinkable, but not very exciting beyond that.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong to make any assumptions!<br /><br />There are certain drinks that are 'ok' and don't really do anything for you, or leave some kind of not-so-great aftertaste lingering on your palate. I can only speak for the Watermelon Strawberry flavor, but it was absolutely fantastic. Delightful even.<br /><br />I felt like a kid drinking a newly invented soft drink just for me. It has a great taste and it's carbonated, so it has a soft drink feel to it, but without the unhealthy ingredients of a soft drink.<br /><br />From what I understand, it's ingredients are:<br /><br />Sparkling 100% Juice<br />All Natural<br />100% DV Vitamin C<br />No sugar or artificial sweeteners added<br />No preservatives<br /><br />Give this a try, you'll be glad you did! It's a great quality drink. Kids and adults will love it just the same!

review/summary: Perfect balance
review/text: I have tried most flavors of Switch and I think Watermelon Strawberry is hands down my most favorite.<br /><br />When you first sip it, the flavor of fresh watermelon (not candy sweet watermelon) is crisp yet light and enhanced by the carbonation, this is quickly followed by a strawberry flavor that can best be described as identical to the strawberry juice at the bottom of the bowl.  Even though this doesn't have added table sugar, the strawberry sweetness (enhanced by other fruit juices) does taste like strawberries with a little bit of sugar sprinkled on them- so the juice at the bottom is sweet but not syrupy thick and sweet...<br /><br />Delicious and carb wise I would use this as a tasty alternative to regular sodas.  Good stuff.

review/summary: Watermelonsaftschorle?
review/text: Living in Germany for several years, I acquired a taste for Apfelsaftschorle or schorle for short, apple juice and sparkling water (Apfelsaft is German for 'apple juice'). The soda water cuts the sweetness, gives the juice a little tang, and makes the drink a better hydrator; the juice makes the soda water a little more interesting. I usually drink any fruit juice this way now.<br /><br />Switch premakes my schorle. This blend was watermelon rather than apple, but very good regardless. I tried it straight, but it would have been better over ice or if it had been mixed with a little more soda water and a little less juice. The ingredients were juice, sparkling water, and a couple of stabilizers, without two of my pet peeves; artificial color, especially red 40, and high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and can recommend it as an excellent alternative to conventional soda, and I'll be looking for it in stores.<br /><br />E.

Taste is not unlike a typical strawberry soda pop, but not as good.  The carbonation effect is overwhelming.  Expected sugar content (natural). 140 calories.

review/text: Switch is a good carbonated beverage that is as advertised.  Many times you get carbonated beverage products that claim to have a particular flavor, in this case watermelon, and the drink tastes nothing like what is claimed.  In this case, the beverage tastes just like watermelon.<br /><br />Other than the authentic flavor, I did not find this drink overly sweet compared to other non-diet carbonated beverages and it has natural flavors.  It does have 140 calories, and while it says no sugar added, sugar is on the nutrition label, which I normally don't read anyway.  If you are health conscious, unlike me, I'd check out the label and ingredients to make sure it's for you.<br /><br />To me, overall this is a pretty good, if not great, carbonated beverage, but not one I would go out of my way to purchase.

review/summary: Great Surprise
review/text: I want to start this review by stating that this is not the perfect balance between juice and carbonated drink I've ever had. That said this is certainly a good alternative for those who love carbonated drinks but don't like some of the ingredients. Switch has attempted to address this concern and I feel it's a step in the right direct. This is an Watermelon/Strawberry flavored juice that is carbonated but without added sugar, preservatives, corn syrup, or caffeine. In other words this is about as natural as you can get without, you know, drinking the real juice.<br /><br />The can is also thinner then a soda can so you're not getting as much liquid as you would a Pepsi or Coke. This means there is less fat in each can, and the makers claim the product is glutton free. It does have a bit of a weird aftertaste, but after a few sips it stops bothering you. While not a perfect drink it's one I enjoyed and will likely pick up again in the future.

review/summary: Not a good Replacement
review/text: The drink is not something I would ever pay to drink. I couldn't even finish the whole can. It has the fizz of soda but doesn't quite taste right. It's not exactly bad tasting, just not good tasting either. I can't say I would ever replace any drink with this one.

review/summary: Sweet carbonated juice
review/text: The Switch Watermelon Strawberry drink is good tasting and all natural.  It should be emphasized that it is full-strength juice, not a "flavored water" type product.  For that reason, I found it a bit strong because I am not accustomed to drinking much juice.  The carbonation does add a bit of lightness to it though.  I like that it didn't taste too artificial.

review/summary: Good flavor but too carbonated
review/text: I really liked this drink. The flavor of the watermelon and strawberries was not overwhelming. It did not seem very different from the other flavored carbonated drinks that we buy in vending machines.<br /><br />I like that it is all natural with no preservatives but I did not like the fact that it is very carbonated. I also like the fact that it does not have corn syrup or sugar that is in most other carbonated beverages.<br /><br />I think that kids would probably like it more because it tastes like candy.

review/summary: Way too sweet!
review/text: I've tried 4 different flavors of The Switch brand beverages. This is my least favorite due to the overly sweet candy like taste. Truthfully I was only able to drink about 1/3 of the can before I had to put it down.  If they would lighten up on some up the more sugary juice and let the other flavors come through it might not be as bad, but even my kids thought this one was too sweet.  This may be considered a "healthy alternative" because it is made with fruit juice and no added sugar, but the taste says otherwise.

review/text: Switch Watermelon Strawberry was tasty, but not something I would go out of my way to order online.  It took little time to finish the beverage.  I would have preferred a larger ounce size.  While it's not completely thirst quenching, it was filling.  I recommend washing the cans before drinking, if you drink straight from them.  Mine arrived dirty, with dirt from the warehouse all over it.  Your 24 pack might be packaged better than my sample drink, but just in case!

review/summary: A Tasty Alternative to Soda ...
review/text: Allow me to say that my situation may be different from yours. I have been a vegetarian since childhood and have perpetually experimented with all sorts of crazy foods -- so my pallet is accustom to more "natural" flavors.<br /><br />I have struggled for years to break my soda habit (besides the high-fructose corn syrup there are a number of other ingredients I'm simply not comfortable putting in my body). (And, Dr. Oz has been fairly forthcoming in saying that these products promote free radicals which hurry the aging process). Switch gave me the carbonation and sweet taste that I crave. No, it's not my favorite Mountain Dew ... but it's a good second-place and a wildly better choice.<br /><br />Some people are complaining about the calories (140 a can). For me (and maybe you), that's not a concern. What impresses me is that this drink is 100% juice. Why drink empty calories when you can fuel your body with goodness?<br /><br />Bottom-line: this product may surprise you! It has a pleasant flavor, is lightly carbonated, and crushed my desire for soda. I must admit, I am a fan!!

review/text: For the occasional drink, sure.  But the sugar content is a little high because of the fruit.  It tastes pretty sweet, but still good...I would drink it when I feel like something sweet.  I bought one case and I will drink it over the course of a couple months.  However, compared to Tommy's Naked Soda, it falls flat.

review/summary: Tastes vaguely like watermelon
review/text: I have tried two other flavors of Switch and found only this one (Watermelon Strawberry) tasted anything like the name suggests.  As with the other Switch flavors, Watermelon/Strawberry is decent, but not great.  As someone who loves fruit, I greatly prefer The Switch over Coke or Sprite.<br /><br />However, don't let the marketing fool you.  While this drink doesn't have high fructose corn syrup (which I hate), it is still very high in calories and definitely not good for someone who is on a diet and looking for an alternative to regular Coke.<br /><br />The main fruit ingredients in all Switch products are grape and apple.  Strawberry and watermelon on the lowest fruits on the list of ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the flavor of The Switch products I have tried.  However, I find the advertising slightly deceptive and would have preferred it to contain fewer calories.

review/summary: We won't be making the Switch
review/text: We're not soda drinkers in our household, an occasional sprite maybe but otherwise I like to mix club soda with fruit juice when I'm in the mood for something bubbly. This sounded intriguing since it's toted as being all natural.<br /><br />I expected a much less sweet flavor, not that it was bad just that it was VERY VERY sweet and candy like. I'm also shocked by the high calories, granted juice in general is high calorie but I was still surprised. My husband really liked the taste and even considered it refreshing so your opinion will likely vary pending what you're accustomed to. Not something I would give my 5yr old or reach for again myself.

review/summary: Candy in a Can
review/text: My 8 y.o. son and I tested two The Switch beverages--this flavor and Kiwi-Berry.  I think we both preferred the latter.  Although, my son seemed to like both.  My thought is this is because they are both quite sweet.  While the Kiwi Berry had a pleasant taste, this one tasted not so much like real watermelons or strawberries as it did the artificial imitations of those flavors one finds in candies.  I can see how this would appeal to a child.  But, as an adult, I found it odd to be drinking a beverage--and one advertised as a healthy alternative to soda (not so much)--that reminded me of my childhood addiction to Jolly Ranchers.  Plus, the cost is exorbitant for what you get.

review/text: The name of Switch Watermelon Strawberry should probably be reduced to just watermelon since I didn't detect much of a strawberry flavor. The taste that was apparent was so-so at best, but what I dislike about this drink is that it feels like I'm pouring acid into my mouth. It's too acidic by far for my taste, and the sugar could be reduced. This may be "natural," but it isn't much of an improvement over good ol' Coca Cola.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks

review/text: This flavor wasn't too shabby. I've had the black cherry before, and it wasn't bad.<br /><br />This was a bit sour, and lightly carbonated. The all natural ingredients are the big plus here. It was watermelon juice colored, I hardly noticed the strawberry.<br /><br />After trying the 1 can of black cherry previously, I had mentioned in my review that it probably would taste good with some rum. So with this one, after taking a sip to see what it tasted like by itself, I dumped a shot of raspberry flavored Bacardi rum into it. It was quite the fruity sensation, and had a nice kick to it.<br /><br />I would try this one again.

review/summary: Too Strongly Flavored & "Watermelon" is the LAST Ingredient!
review/text: The flavor name of this "The Switch" drink is "Watermelon Strawberry."  I thought there was a law in what you put for the beginning names of a flavor -- it is supposed to be the main ingredient by weight.  For example in a soup named Beef Vegetable the ingredient of Beef must be listed as one of the first ingredients in the soup, not "potatoes, carrots, etc."  In this case the first ingredients are "100% juice" reconstituted with "filtered sparkling water" of the following juice concentrates: "Grape, Apple, Acerola, Strawberry and Watermelon."  Note that Watermelon and Strawberry are listed last and next to last among the fruit juice concentrates.<br /><br />I think the drink tastes too strong and the carbonation is too strong.  Even after adding ice AND letting it become diluted, the flavor is too strong.  Now that would be a good thing if I liked the flavor but I do not.  I have tried one other flavor, the Kiwi Berry and it is also like this as well -- too strong.<br /><br />AND like I said on the other review, I think it would make a good base for an ice cream punch bowl drink. A lot of vanilla ice cream would help. Would not buy it for a regular thirst quenching drink.<br /><br />140 calories for 8.3 oz. including 36 carbs (35g. sugar), 15mg. sodium, 100% daily allowance of Vitamin C.

review/summary: Durkee tenderizer is a good one
review/text: We don't use a lot of meat tenderizer so when we ran out of our Adolphs, it had been a while since we had purchased it.  They didn't have it in our local store so of course I went to Amazon to find some.  The best thing about Amazon besides prices is the great collection of reviews for almost every product and after reading a few, I discovered that Adolphs no longer used papain and instead had switched to the other common enzyme bromelain.  This made me realize that the last Adolphs I had purchased was not the original formula and gave me an "aha that's why it doesn't seem to be working as well as I remember it used to in my younger days" moment.  A little more research and I found that Durkee meat tenderizer still uses papain.  We purchased a 3 pack of the institutional size Durkee tenderizer which is probably more than I'll use in my remaining time on this earth so we gave two of them to friends.  I have to say that this is the tenderizing effect I remember from the old Adolphs brand.  Tougher cuts of meat are now very tender when we mechanically tenderize and use the Durkees tenderizer.  As explained by the experts, papain doesn't deactivate until well over the medium rare temperature for beef so you can't leave extra meat in the fridge too long after using this tenderizer or it will be mush.  We are very pleased with the Durkee product and with the price of tender cuts now being rediculous we have a weapon to keep our meat costs down.  Thanks Durkee for a great product.

review/summary: Chocolates might be great; shipping was less so; customer service is great
review/text: While it was shipped to me insulated in styrofoam, no cold packs were included in the shipment--which was heading to Atlanta in early September (the American South in the summer).  I assumed that since I was paying over $20 for shipping--the absolute fastest time, greater care would be taken to ensure that the product arrived intact.  Unfortunately, the chocolates I received were largely melted.  I do not recommend the purchase of this item to be shipped to any region experiencing temperatures above 78 degrees.<br /><br />UPDATE: Received an e-mail, which read (in part) as follows: First, my apologies for not answering you earlier... I didn't notice there was a melting issue with your order till late last week while addressing a small more recent delivery problem.  Anyway, as you have noticed with your order, melting can and does happen in transit, but luckily only with an insignificant number of our packages as we only experience about two dozen or three dozen a year out of well over 15,000 packages. Insignificant when view in percentage terms, but still most infuriating when this happens.<br /><br />The e-mail went on to note that they are replacing my order.  I am stunned--I have had a melting issue before with a different chocolate company (remember, I live in Atlanta, Georgia, where summer temperatures are a bear), and I received nothing in the way of satisfaction.  I figured it would be the same and didn't even bother to directly contact the company (a mistake on my part).  I am *very* pleased with this level of service.

review/summary: Perfectly Delicious
review/text: If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />The "I Love You" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's R�verie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: These chocolates are one of the very best one can get. The problem is the price in the USA.<br /><br />In Belgium they cost only 16.50 Euros a Kilo (approx 2.2 lbs)= USD 22.00.<br /><br />Transport is expensive because they travel cooled...

review/summary: Belgian Chocolate
review/text: When I thinkof the richest chocolates I usually thinkof fine Belgian chocolates. Lately I needed some small thank you gifts. The chocolate ballotins arrived in TWO days without express delivery. Thanks to fresh product and fine packaging the chocolates could not have arrived as they did: in perfect shape. My friends were very thrilled and even grudgingly gave me a nibble. This selection contained mostly liquid centers with shells ranging from thick to thin, milk to bitter chocolates.

review/summary: totally overrated
review/text: The Leonidas chocolates being peddled in the USA bear little/no resemblance to those available in Europe. After enjoying Leonidas in Germany (Aachen and Munich) for many years I placed an order here in New York State. What I received was (a) crudely presented boxes of (b) thick, hard-shelled (c) anonymous flavoured cream centres. With the exception of the coffee creams (which were more or less as I remember them from Europe) the rest of the box seemed to consist of two undefinable centres. Extremely disappointed with this order. The Godiva selection my mother received for Christmas was FAR superior in every respect -- packaging, presentation, appearance, texture, taste. I won't buy Leonidas in the USA again.

review/text: Simply delectable assortment. The only negative I can think of is the lack of an assortment guide. But, I guess that adds to the surprise. The package is beautifully and lovingly packaged, and my chocolates arrived without melting! Great service! The chocolates themselves melt in your mouth and their coffee-hazlenut pralines are to die for! The hazlenut is just that-pure, unadulterated nuts-that said, some people might expect ferrero rocher like taste-its very different, and for some people, even distasteful. But I love it! There are around three layers in the box, and each layer has around seven pieces. Pretty good value actually, and makes an excellent gift!

review/summary: Good but not THAT good
review/text: After sending these chocolates as Christmas presents in the last two years, I have decided to sample them myself.<br /><br />If one includes shipping, these chocolates costs around $1.50 per piece. That is not the highest chocolate price but still a premium price.<br /><br />As others have noted, the packaging is very well done. The box itself is wrapped in a stryofoam box. The ribbons add a nice touch to the presentation.<br /><br />The taste of these chocolates, however, is merely good. As a comparison, I think the Dove chocolates one can get at a grocery store is about 80% as good at about 1/5 the price.<br /><br />I think Godiva chocolates are about as good.<br /><br />But no one gets credit and thanks for sending Godiva (non-box kind) or Dove chocolates for Christmas and they certainly don't come in a nice box with a ribbon and a Belgian chocolate brand.<br /><br />I have tasted better chocolates.<br /><br />If you want the most premium tasting chocolates possible, then these will somewhat disappoint. Nonetheless, no one will dislike these chocolates especially when given as a Christmas present.

review/summary: Very good, but not fantastic
review/text: O,K. Leonidas is one of the best Belgian chocolate makers. Alas the "pralines" they make in Belgium are not for export (too much whipped cream and perishable ingredients). What they sell in America is the not so perishable stuff (hence the nuts and chocolate cream). That may be why so many reviewers evoke Nutella. I sent a box to my brother who spent time in Belgium as a teenager. He was very happy, but pointed out that there is more to Leonidas: white marzipan with a wanut on top, strawberry marzipan and, of course the pistacchio whipped cream, etc..Leonidas remains a good option if you like chocoalte.<br />Somehow my previous review was taken off. Hope this one stays.

review/text: I purchased the Leonidas Chocolates from Amazon about a month ago.  My wife and I love chocolate. After reading the raving reviews I felt this would be a great gift.  The shipping was very quick, so no complaints there.  The chocolate had a nice flavor, but we were not impressed with the fillings. If we had to choose, the hazelnut was the best in the box, followed by a white chocolate that was good.  For the price, you can find better chocolate elsewhere.

review/summary: Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment
review/text: I ordered a Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment. I had to pick up the box at a local UPS outlet one day after the first attempted delivery.  The weather here is mild, not very hot or very cold.  When I opened the box and sampled the chocolates I immediately noticed a stale and unpalatable taste.  I recognized this taste from what occurs when chocolate is frozen or exposed to refrigerated air.  I responded to an email from Amazon asking for a review of my purchase.  I recounted my experience.  I received an email from Leonidas claiming that to their knowledge the product was not sent damaged.  Leonidas stated they would replace my order.  They have not.  I emailed Leonidas again asking about their intentions to replace my order.  I have received no reply.  Amazon attached a statement to the email I received from Leonidas disavowing any responsibility for Leonidas' product or the delivery of it.  So, here is my response: I will make no more purchases of food stuffs from Leonidas until a refund or replacement is forth coming.  I understand Amazon's position, but as a consumer of many items purchased via the Internet, I think that Amazon needs to review their policy regarding 3rd party vendors.  This is the first time any product I have purchase from Amazon had a problem.  I am somewhat shocked that their attitude towards my problem is: you're own your own.

So, I ordered it for the family (I just sampled..).  The packaging is really nice.. it would make a great gift.  As for the chocolate itself, well... it is better than most store brands, but not as good as Godiva.  I would rather pay a little more for better quality, or pay a lot less for a bar of Cadbury.

review/text: I have made their salmon cakes before and found them pretty good. So I thought this would be a nice change for tuna too. It truly is easy, and tastes delicious. A couple of notes to the reader. Remember that most tuna cans are now FIVE ounces, not SIX, so your recipe will be off a bit from standard. Also, I chose to skip adding egg, just to see. Ten minutes later I was enjoying wonderful cakes that didn't taste fishy or dry. I chose to use albacore, and I find that more mild. The mix provides a spicy, flavorful patty that's easy to shape, holds together well, and simply tastes great. Definitely will add this to my list for go-to, easy and tasty meals!

review/text: It's always better to start from scratch, and it's always better to be a well known executive chef, but most of us don't have time...and just aren't great chefs.  Next best is Zatarain's, or the other brand I won't mention here.  Quick, genuine and delightful, you'll keep the wife and kids at the family table with these tuna cakes, and why not an entire New Orleans dinner... woops, the kids will bring their friends, so let's make an evening of it.  The key here is fast, easy, authentic and CHEAP!  Sure, there are the diamond studded flunkies who can afford the lobster and crab, but for those of us who work, Tuna will do... Whether the kids are three, or thirty, these cakes will please  and you can keep the fat down.  I say, give them a try... and if you are single and expect that special person over for dinner, show her that you can cook, feed her right and you wno't rergret it.

review/summary: Zatarain's Tuna Cake Mix
review/text: I tried the Tuna Cake Mix, added tuna Disappointed! I then added crab to a batch, since the main ingridence is the same for tuna, or crab. Still the same, not what I expected. Your better off making these from scratch.

review/summary: Not as it seems...
review/text: Please note that the item that is shown is NOT the product that will be shipped to you.  In spite of the seller's contention that the item is same (but in a new box), the actual tea is a different concoction.  Purchased for my mother, who eventually called the makers, who did in fact say that the tea's ingredients have changed -- and is much stronger!  Buyer beware :)

review/summary: Only 40 calories
review/text: Just a note for everyone that thinks carrots and celery are the only snacks you can get on a diet. This mini roll has only 40 calories, a big burst of flavor and packs in any lunch bag, mini-clutch, pocket, wallet, you name it. Two thumbs up for a great snack for kids and adults alike.

review/summary: So much better than the usual dried minced onion.
review/text: Fresh at Hand Onion Mix is a mixture of red onions, white onions, shallots, and chives.  Because of the process of flash-freezing and drying, they are the next best thing to fresh. . .and more convenient.  You won't be disappointed; you'll find many ways to use these gems.  Try it!
