review/summary: Quick Meal & Tastes Great!
review/text: This package of six lasted no time in my home!  So simple to fix and great tasting, my teen boys had them eaten within a day!<br /><br />These simple meals would be great for brown bagging lunchers.  After only 4 minutes, you have a complete meal at restaurant quality.

review/summary: A very convenient way to have a good lunch.
review/text: The Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, Ziti & Meat Sauce bowls are simple to use and pretty tasty.  The little bowls come with a strainer lid, a separate sauce container, and dry pasta.  You prepare the meal by first removing the strainer cover then taking out the sauce and setting it aside.  You then fill the bowl with water up to the fill line.  Place the strainer cover back on and microwave it on high for 3:30.  When the pasta is done you set it aside and cook the sauce for 30 seconds. Lastly, you drain the pasta and add the sauce.<br /><br />Overall the process works well, except the sauce required another 20 seconds to get the right temperature.  The strainer top is efficient and gets almost all of the water out.  The pasta is tender and the sauce tastes pretty good.  The meat sauce has a lot of meat, but not much in that way of onion or tomato chunks, which is fine by me.  Additionally, the sauce is mildly spicy, which I liked.  You get a pretty decent serving size as well, perfect for lunch.<br /><br />I like that the sauce is separate from the pasta, so you can add as little or as much as you want, and they give you plenty.  I also appreciate the fact that the bowls do not need to be refrigerated or frozen, so they are perfect to bring to the office.  The only thing missing is grated cheese, although that may have affected the calories too much, resulting in a not so Healthy Choice.<br /><br />All in all... A quick and tasty lunch that is not full of preservatives, and the packaging is well designed too.

review/summary: VERY easy, very tasty, and a decent-sized meal
review/text: Frankly, I was surprised at the size of this meal; I was expecting the typical tiny nuke bowl I've seen. I think I'm a bit bigger eater than many, and I found this quite satisfying. The bowl and strainer top were good quality plastic--not the stuff that goes mushy when you nuke it. I had one little problem with the system, and it was my own fault. I urge people to make sure to read the directions when nuking the sauce to avoid a very large and noisy mess. hehehe *blushing*<br /><br />Speaking of the sauce, it had a "kick" or "bite" I'd never tasted in a commercial sauce. Very unusual!!<br /><br />I missed one little thing in this fine meal system, and that was a dab of mozzerella cheese. It's an excellent choice, especially for those preferring a meal-for-one that's a little bit bigger.

review/summary: Innovative Convenience and Robust Flavor
review/text: I think Healthy Choice has a real winner here!  The packaging is innovative. Everything is there to easily store and prepare a delicious entr&eacute;e. I was very pleasantly surprised with the taste of the meat sauce - it was quite spicy and flavorful!  To be honest, while I do occasionally purchase the Healthy Choice frozen meals for low calorie lunches at the office I find most of them to be bland and not particularly tasty. WOW! The Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce entr&eacute;e is robustly flavorful and delicious.<br /><br />The portion size was about right, too.  I was quite satisfied without feeling stuffed or bloated.  Preparation was simple. Remove and set aside the sauce pack, add water to the pasta, snap on the strainer lid, nuke for a few minutes, drain the water from the pasta, nuke the sauce for 30 seconds (or don't), mix the sauce and pasta, enjoy a hot, satisfying meal.<br /><br />Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers are shelf-stable. No refrigeration is needed so you can easily keep a few on hand at your desk or in your pantry.  Currently, besides the Ziti & Meat Sauce there are 5 other flavors available. You can get Sesame Teriyaki Chicken (380 calories), Rotini & Zesty Marina Sauce (300 calories), Southwestern Style Chicken (310 Calories), Sweet & Sour Chicken (390 calories), and Szechwan Beef with Asian Style Noodles (370 calories).  I will definitely be on the lookout for the other Fresh Mixers flavors to add variety to my lunches.<br /><br />The Ziti & Meat Sauce entr&eacute;e is quite good by itself but personally, I would have liked the meal to also include a small package of grated cheese (like parmesan, Romano, and/or Mozzarella) to sprinkle on top of the prepared meal, if desired.  I would also like to see the Fresh Mixers available in a variety pack.  My preference would be to have 2 each of the Rotini, Southwestern Chicken and Ziti & Meat sauce together in a variety package. And the other three varieties could make up another variety pack.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti & Meat Sauce. Easy to store, easy to prepare, very tasty and filling without a lot of calories, sodium or fat. The containers stack easily and I am planning on saving my used, empty container.  I think it will make a great microwave steamer for veggies or a corn cobbette.

review/summary: "Fresh Mixers" to "Lunch Express" Not Good For Consumers
review/text: Very disappointed with the direction Healthy Choice has taken with all of its former "Fresh Mixers" line, especially the ones that contain chicken.  I am changing my rating on all of these products from 5 stars to 3 stars.  With the switch to "Lunch Express," apparently they decided to lower their production costs and make more on each unit.  First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers for the chicken dishes, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.  The convenience, taste and portioning are still attractive, so I'm continuing my subscription for now -- which is probably what Healthy Choice is counting on -- but just wanted to state my disappointment over yet another company placing greed over customer satisfaction.

review/summary: Easy grab and go
review/text: This is basically like "Top Roman" pasta. You can make it a little more appetizing by adding frozen vegetables (or fresh), cheese, egg, or whatever else you want. By itself, it's not quite hearty enough to keep me full for longer than a couple of hours, but it a &lt; $3 meal, so I can't complain too much. It's pretty quick and easy, though you do have to microwave it for ~5 min. Others have complained about it being very spicy. I'm ok with moderately spicy food and don't find the sauce too bad.<br /><br />Overall, for grab and go, easy and cheap, I'd say it's worth what you pay for it, esp since you can add some extras to make it feel a little more "gourmet".  It's not delicious, but it's at least on par with other frozen meals. I like the meat in the sauce too (extra calories & fat == extra hours of fullness...which is part of the reason I ordered this particular flavor).

review/summary: Not spicy enough. Noodles not quite right.
review/text: I love the idea of this meal, everything cooked separately and no need for additional bowls or containers.<br /><br />The sauce was good, but bland for my taste.  Not quite spicy enough for me, so I now add some red pepper flakes on my subsequent preparations.<br /><br />The noodles aren't very good.  They look to be whole wheat or some other off color noodle.  The are very thin and break apart easily after cooking.  They don't really balance well with the hearty sauce.  I suppose its hard to come up with a good quality white noodle that has a long room temperature shelf life and can be microwaved in minutes.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good, Although A Bit Too Spicy For My Tastes
review/text: The pasta was actually better than I expected, even though it was a bit too spicy for my tastes.  I ate a few saltine crackers with it to help "tone down" the spiciness.  The directions were spot on as far as the cooking time.<br /><br />For those who are concerned about the packaging, I've started washing and reusing my containers.  You can add your own pasta (I used a little less than 1/2 cup), cook it just like the original instructions say, then add some spaghetti sauce.  Viola!  ;-)  I'm still experimenting, but so far I'd recommend a small-sized, thin pasta so it'll cook faster.  Regular elbow macaroni takes longer than 3-1/2 minutes to cook. ;-)<br /><br />But anyway, I'll give the dinner 4 stars, and would bump it to 5 stars if they'd tone down the spices just a bit.

review/summary: Love this sauce!
review/text: This has been my favorite Healthy Choice Fresh Mixer to date.  This meal does require draining. My office has a water cooler, microwave but no sink. There is NO WAY I'm going to take my food into the restroom to drain it. What I've done is kept a Fresh Mixer bowl from a previous lunch. I can then drain the water into it (with NO MESS) and then take it to a sink once I'm done eating.<br /><br />I was impressed with the taste of this meal. I'm a picky sauce person.  I also like thiner sauces on my pasta. This was not thin but seasoned perfectly.  No one ingredient overwhelmed the sauce. Usually they are too meaty or sweet. This was a perfect spicy Italian blend. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The portion size is perfect. I'm a fan of high protein lunches because they keep me fuller longer. This one packs in 15g of protein. Love it.  This does have more sodium than I'm used to eating, however it's only 25% of the RDA so it's considerably lower than other quick lunches.<br /><br />The only con is the cost. Yes, it's cheaper than going out to eat at lunch and in an emergency, this is not a problem. This is a meal that I could eat more than once a week so the cost would holding me back from purchasing it as often as I'd like to.

review/text: This is the best of the HC FreshMixers...and i've tried them all.<br /><br />The taste is very meaty and rich, lots of good flavor.  Drain after 4 minutes but no longer, otherwise the ziti gets too soggy.  You don't have to heat the sauce unless you like your food VERY hot.<br /><br />The only con I have is that they put some oil in with the ziti and it gets onto the bottom of the sauce tray. So, when you take the sauce tray out while microwaving the ziti, you get oil all over the counter or your fingers.

review/summary: Good with a Little Help from Our Emergency Kit
review/text: We enjoyed Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, Zita & Meat Sauce.  My friend and I are spicemouths, and we found the mixers decently flavored, perhaps better than some dishes we've tried in Italian restaurants that needed to fire their cooks.  We eat in many different restaurants throughout the United States to evaluate the food.  What we have discovered is that mediocre food can be made tasty if we apply our emergency taste-enhancer kit.  Actually this dish was better than mediocre; in fact it was tasty, especially after we added some items from the kit. (We keep an array of items in our glove compartments of our vehicles and on our breakfast bar.) Realizing that we did not want to alter the calorie-count too much, we added a tiny shake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C5Z23M">Kraft Grated Parmesan Cheese - 4.5 lb. container</a>, which was about 10 calories.  When we eat pasta, we like a little cheese. Then, being the way we are -- Louisiana and Texas people -- we needed a little kick.  We shook on a few flakes of crushed red.  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F0Z0T6">Tone's Spices Red Pepper Crushed (13.5 oz) - Large Restaurant / Food Service Size Shaker Container - Best Value per Ounce</a>-- we really do buy the large restaurant shaker, but we carry a smaller version around with us in the car.)  That's all we added, although we do have other items in our emergency supplies.  With those two little items, the ziti and meat sauce tasted good.<br /><br />Preparing it was fun.  The cute little container with the strainer lid amused me.  I thought I would wash it and reuse it, but I was amazed to discover it was engineered for single use.<br /><br />This meal of 340 calories was satisfying and handled our hunger efficiently.  It contains 600 mg sodium, which is perhaps a little less than some prepared dishes.  I was surprised to see that it contains 990 mg potassium.  People with renal disease should probably avoid this product unless they have the approval of their physician or registered dietician. There are 6 grams of total fat and 56 carb grams. With 8 grams of dietary fiber, it should get an approving nod from Weight Watchers. It meets the criteria established by the American Heart Association.<br /><br />I would recommend this dish for anyone who needs to take lunch to work where there is no refrigerator but where there is a microwave oven.  I thought we would eat it again soon, but weeks have passed and we are still thinking about it.<br /><br />Mostly recommended.<br /><br />Mary Lou Cheatham, co-author of THE COLLARD PATCH/<br />Author of FLAVORED WITH LOVE, SOLOMON'S PORCH,<br />DO YOU KNOW HOW GOD LOVES YOU?

review/summary: Too spicy for my taste
review/text: I had seen the commercials for the Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers and I felt like that was a really clever idea and an easy meal for lunch. The process to make the meal is pretty easy-take the sauce portion out, fill water to the water line-although the water line is harder to see and I had to keep lifting it up to see if I was close-, microwave the pasta for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, then drain. Then you take the sauce portion and microwave for just 30 seconds and then mix the two together and eat.<br /><br />When I took my first bite, I found it to be not bad but on my second, the spiciness took over. As I ate more, I found the spicy flavor getting too much to handle. I couldn't tase much else. I'm assuming it's because of the use of Italian Sausage in the meat sauce.My sister also tried the Ziti & Meat Sauce meal and she found it to be too spicy and she has a higher tolerance for spicy things.<br /><br />I didn't care for the flavor of the meat sauce, so I doubt I'll be trying this Healthy Choice Ziti & Meat Sauce meal again.

review/summary: Easy meal on the go, with a few nitpicks...
review/text: For the most part, I was impressed with the design elements that went into the steamer/strainer/etc. components and the meal was much tastier than my standard microwave speed lunch choices.<br /><br />I only had a few minor issues with the product over all... the directions are spread out in several different locations on the package, so there remains a chance that you might miss one and prepare the meal (most importantly to remove the plastic film on the strainer lid before cooking).<br /><br />Also, the water fill line is not all that easy to make out. Most products have a more obvious version and I found myself having to take extra care in adding water.<br /><br />The meat sauce took a bit longer than suggested to cook. I had to up the cook time to a full minute to get a satisfactory temperature.<br /><br />My final criticism concerns the heat of the container after cooking. Granted, you get a little rest for that to cool down while you cook the sauce, but it was still uncomfortably warm when I ported the two (with the sauce atop the strainer lid and lower/main dish in my hand).<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the product, despite my small nitpicks and, barring a prohibative price point, would definitely purchase mixers for my on the go working lunches (of which, I seem to have plenty).

review/summary: Ingenious packaging AND great taste--what a combo!
review/text: The first pleasant surprise of this the new Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers is that the packaging is truly ingenious--it is a pasta cooker, pasta drainer, and serving dish all in one.  With the Ziti and Meat Sauce, you simply remove the lid, add water to fill line, replace lid, pop in microwave for 3 1/2 minutes, drain the pasta right in the container (the lid is a pasta drainer), heat the sauce (which comes in a separate container within the same package) for 30 seconds, pour sauce over drained pasta and eat!  I will admit that the packaging gave me a few moments of confusion at first--you have to remove a film from the top of the pasta drainer and remove a "security" ring of plastic around the package before you can remove the lid--but once I had done it one time, it was a piece of cake.<br /><br />The second pleasant surprise is how GREAT the product tastes!  I was amazed that something that can be prepared in 4 minutes could be so good.  I know some people think "Eh, it's called Healthy Choice; it must be diet food, so it probably tastes nasty."  NOPE!  I've dieted much of my life and I've eaten some NASTY diet products, but this ain't that!  Just one note on taste though--the sauce is quite "zesty," which I loved because I cook with a lot of pepper and herbs because I'm hypertensive and can't use much salt, but if you don't like spicy food or spicy food bothers your tummy, you may want to just try one before you buy a whole bunch of them.<br /><br />And, on top of all that, the meal is filling, too!  I have eaten many prepared meals in the "healthy" category where I felt like I needed to eat another meal after I finished the product--it just wasn't enough food to make me feel satisfied!  But I haven't felt like that with this product.  Granted, I do eat a piece of crusty bread with the product (because I love eating crusty bread with pasta) and that helps me feel fuller, but I was very pleasantly surprised that this meal is really a meal and not just an appetizer masquerading as a meal!<br /><br />As a person who brought her lunch to work every day, I can only wish that these Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers had been around before I retired earlier this year!

review/summary: Tasty and Convenient
review/text: Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is very easy to use. To prepare it you remove the strainer lid and sauce tray, add water, and put the strainer lid back on. You then microwave the bowl on high for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, letting it stand for one minute after heating. Then you drain the pasta with the handy strainer lid and heat the sauce in the microwave for 30 seconds on high. When it is finished you mix and serve. The instructions are easy to understand and everything in the package is clearly labeled. You have a nice convenient meal in about five minutes.<br /><br />Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is a good choice when you need a quick meal. It needs no refrigeration and has a long shelf life so it's a good item to stock up on. It is very tasty if a bit too spicy as the spices left a bit of an aftertaste. Because it is a single serving, it is not really for families at dinnertime - it is better suited as lunch, to eat after the gym, or for a single person. In fact, because it doesn't need refrigeration, it is a perfect lunch for people that work in an office, provided there is a sink nearby to drain the pasta. Because everything is contained in one package, cleaning is minimal - all you have to do is rinse out the containers to place in the recycling bin.<br /><br />While Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is a healthy meal alternative there are a few things to be aware of. The meal has 340 calories - 50 calories are from fat. There is no Trans fat, but the saturated fat is 10% of the Daily Value and the cholesterol is 7% of the Daily Value. As with all prepared meals, the sodium content is high - 25% of the Daily Value.<br /><br />Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is a convenient choice when you are pressed for time and not fussy about the type of sauce you use. However, it might be cheaper to buy your own pasta instead.

review/summary: Tasty---Tasty---and---Yummy TOO :-p
review/text: The HEALTHY CHOICE FRESH MIXERS: ZITI & MEAT SAUCE is delicious! It's easy to make and ready within 4-5 minutes. A slight issue is the water "fill line" on the container--for the noodles--it's a little hard to see.<br /><br />All you have to do is add water to the pasta, cook that first (3:30-minutes) and then drain with the included strainer as you warm up the sauce (:30-seconds). Add the sauce to the noodles and mix. That's it!<br /><br />The ziti & meat sauce has a very well seasoned flavor and small chunks of ground beef. There's no cheese added, which is good for those who are lactose intolerant, and the portion is just the right size. It filled me up, without making me feel too full, and it satisfied my hunger. Couple this with a side of salad or a vegetable and you've got a pretty good meal.<br /><br />There's 6g of fat (2g-sat fat) and 340 calories (50 calories from fat) making this a true "healthy choice," since I've read that you shouldn't eat anything that gets more than half of its calories from fat. Compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MICPSA">Chef Boyardee Beef Ravioli, 7.5-Ounce Microwavable Bowls (Pack of 12)</a>, the HEALTHY CHOICE ZITI is lower in fat by 2grams.<br /><br />It tastes good and you don't have to store it in the freezer or fridge, so it's good to take on the road as long as you have access to a microwave and some water when you plan on eating it. Yum!

review/summary: Tastes good, but a bit messy and wasteful
review/text: The pasta and sauce are separately packaged with the dry pasta in the bottom plastic container and the sauce in an inner container above the pasta.  The top is perforated, with a plastic film covering the holes.  You tear off the plastic film, remove the sauce, fill with water, and nuke.  So far so good.  Drain the pasta, heat the sauce for a very short time (30 sec.), mix and eat.<br /><br />The sauce is surprisingly good - like a jarred meat sauce, but with actual meat in it (or at least, something that resembles meat closely enough).  It has a small amount of spice to it - this isn't something I would serve to small children, just larger kids and grown ups.<br /><br />The drawbacks to this dish are that the pasta is coated with a bit of oil that I was unable to avoid - once done, I felt like I needed to wash my hands - I think it was mostly from the draining step.  Finally, there are two plastic containers included in this.  One of them does have a reusable plastic top, but it has holes in it.  I suppose you could tape up the holes, or use it store things you might want to air a bit (like cheese).  Otherwise, you are tossing a good bit of plastic.  Both containers are marked '5' recyclable, so perhaps you can recycle them where you live.

review/summary: Proper pasta with a savory sauce
review/text: There are several brands of microwavable meals on the market - Dinty Moore, Campbell's, etc - which do not need to be refrigerated, and require you to do no more than unseal the container and microwave it, usually for about 90 seconds.  These Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers are a little more involved, requiring you to add water (which hardly seems an onerous task, but these days, who knows what's considered onerous?) and they take about 5 minutes to prepare.  For the slight extra inconvenience, you get fresher pasta, tasting more like 'proper' cooking.<br /><br />The water level line is not as clearly marked, and the sauce cover not as easily removable, as they could be.<br /><br />This particular variety is very tasty.  Packaged pasta sauces often have a harsh, chemical taste, but this one was nice enough.  It's hardly a hearty meal, but it's a good light snack.  If you take microwavable meals to work (or college, or wherever) every day, then you'll want some variety, so you should give this one a try.

review/summary: Pretty good, bur barely worth the fuss
review/text: While it's more filling and fresher tasting than the microwabable pasta bowl made by Chef Boyardee, it's also a bit more of a hassle, what with 4 or 5 steps to follow until you're ready to eat.  This could take nearly 10 minutes, which is a pretty long time for a microwave meal.  Some gripes to get out of the way:<br /><br />>The instructions on the side are in a tiny font size, so keep a magnifying glass handy.<br />>The water fill line is almost impossible to see, magnifying glass or no, although filling the bowl a little less than half way seems to work.<br />>The tag on the sauce packet, which is supposed to help tear it open, tears off while leaving the packet intact.  Keep a pair of scissors handy.<br /><br />With all that out of the way, with some trial and error, the little meal itself is fine.  The pasta comes out perfectly, and the sauce is just tangy enough (for me, at least), with little chunks of meat here and there (allegedely beef, but it could be Soylent Green for all I know).  It's definitely filling enough, but at 340 calories with 6 grams of fat, it could be an entire meal for those watching their diet.  I might buy it if I saw it in a store, depending on the price (anything over $2.99 would be criminal for this), but then again I won't be looking that hard, either.

review/summary: Quick and easy when you want it
review/text: My ziti and meat sauce arrived today and I opened the package to see just what this product is.  I received a box with 6 individually wrapped meals.  I took one out of the box and looked at the nutrition label.  This is always the first thing I do with any prepared food, especially ones claiming to be "healthy".  The Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, Ziti and Meat Sauce's label wasn't half bad.  There are no trans fats and no MSG.  The oil content is low and the pasta is made with whole wheat flour.  Per the nutrition label:  Fat 6g: Sat Fat 2g: Carbs 56g: Fiber 8g (wow): Sugar 10g (a little high): Protein 15g.  The sodium was 600mg - a little high if you're watching your blood pressure.  Total Calories = 340.  All in all, not bad.<br /><br />I followed the instructions to prepare the ziti - add water to the line and cook 3 minutes 30 seconds then drain.  It comes with a convenient lid designed for draining the pasta. The pasta came out cooked but not over cooked.  Next you are instructed to heat the meat sauce for 30 seconds.  I removed the cover but no instructions said if I should or shouldn't remove the cover.  I ended up with meat sauce splattered on the inside of my microwave.  Finally, you pour the sauce over the drained pasta and eat.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, the pasta was al dente.  The meat sauce was sweeter than I like and had an interesting spiciness to it with a mild bite.  I prefer a meat sauce that is more salty and less sweet but I know a lot of people who like a sweet sauce so I still gave the product a good rating.  The sauce is meaty and the serving size is just right.  Served with fresh fruit or a leafy green salad and you have a complete meal.

review/summary: An average microwave meal
review/text: Overall, this is an average microwave meal.  The instructions on preparation are very clear, but the water fill line is difficult to see.  However, if you've prepared microwaved pasta previously, you would have an idea of how much water is needed.  The taste is average with the pasta being better than average, but the meat sauce being a little salty.  The serving size is sufficient for most, but the saltiness of the meat might lead to extra liquid consumption.  This is a Healthy Choice meal and its low calorie and fat content are good for those who are dieting or trying to maintain their current weight.  The convenient packaging make it easy to store due to its small size and stackability.

review/summary: Convenient and tasty
review/text: I am a fan of Healthy Choice products and this one is good too. I've generally used their frozen food options but liked the idea of a shelf storable healthy option for lunch.  This pack contains everything needed for a quick and healthy pasta lunch.  The directions are clear and easy to follow.  The straining device that drains excess water after microwaving the pasta works well and the pasta sauce packet contains a sufficient amount of sauce for the pasta.<br /><br />This mixer takes a little more time and effort that a frozen option due to having the microwave the pasta, drain it and add the sauce.  However, the trade off of more time for preparation is outweighed by having an option that can be stored on a shelf or in a desk drawer.  A nice option for work or on the go!

review/summary: Nice and Spicy
review/text: Ziti with meat sauce is the flavor of Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers I received from the program. I liked it, although it is a little too spicy for my taste. It has a smooth texture and the pasta doesn't clump. My husband likened this (in a good way) to Beefaroni. I like the fact that you add water, microwave for 2.5 minutes, then strain with the cover, then mix in the sauce. However, the instructions for cooking should be on the separate sauce packet and not the side of the container, which is impossible to look at without spilling once you've added the water. The entire thing except for the plastic overwrap is recyclable, too, if that might thrill you.  This did inspire me to try other flavors from the grocery store, specifically chicken teriyaki, which I also liked but not quite as much as this flavor. I would definitely recommend it for its ease of use, portability, speed of cooking, and flavor.  Just move the cooking directions to the sauce packet, Healthy Choice, and you've got a winner!

review/text: This product is wonderfully convenient. You can keep it in your desk drawer at work (it doesn't have to be refrigerated) and have a handy, healthy lunch that can be microwaved in about four minutes. The taste is not bad -- not as good as homemade pasta and sauce, but I didn't expect it to be. For something you microwave at the office, it's excellent.

review/summary: By Golly, it is actually TASTY!
review/text: I can't believe this Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers actually tastes good!  And furthermore, the directions are simple, written well, complete with pictures if you can't read instructions well.  In other words, if all fails, look at the pictures!<br /><br />The packaging is compact, a bowl with the pasta, a lid that becomes the strainer, and another lid that contains the sauce.  It requires 3 and 1/2 minutes to cook the pasta.  And microwaving is safe; it doesn't make it coarse or soggy.  Let it set a minute and heat the sauce for 30 seconds.  Easy, a lunch/meal in less than 5 minutes.  This isn't meant to be enough for a dinner/meal, so you hearty eaters can open a can of vegetables and there you have a meal.<br /><br />One note on cooking the pasta.  Make sure the water covers every piece of pasta, otherwise you may get a hard end on the ziti.<br /><br />Take this for lunch on the go.  Eat it for a quick dinner and you have a tasty meal.  There are only 6 grams of fat, and 2g of saturated fat, and 230 calories.  Total carbs are 56g and 15g of protain.<br /><br />Nonrefrigerated!<br />The special thing here is that the meat sauce with enough meat, does not have to be refrigerated.  So, my only guess is that is is hydrated or dehydrated, whatever they call it, so it doesn't need refrigeration.<br /><br />Quick and easy prep time, and tasty!.......Rizzo

review/summary: Convenient, high-quality, delicious and healthy meals: Healthy Choice
review/text: I usually do not buy off-the-shelf microwaveable foods, but I decided to try these Healthy Choice meals because they were offered to me as an Amazon Vine reviewer, and the experience turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The meals I received were Healthy Choice Ziti with Meat Sauce. The meals were very easy to prepare in my microwave. The packages serve as the preparation dishes, and come in multi-segment bowls that you heat one at a time. Overall preparation time, from figuring out how to prepare them to sitting down to eat, was five minutes. The Ziti with Meat Sauce tasted delicious, almost as good as home made. The sauce had both a delicate sweetness and a powerful tangy spiciness that excited my palate, and the ziti came out perfectly al dente. I felt satisfied tastewise and fullness-wise after I was finished. After this positive experience, I will be looking for other Healthy Choice meals to have in my cupboards for quick and healthy, delicious meals.  [...]

review/summary: Fresh mixers in small bowls: Quick hot meal for busy folks
review/text: This is a meal solution for busy working folks who would like a hot and fresh meal with minimal prep time. You could use this either for lunch or dinner. One distinct feature of this product is that it comes with individual units containing the fresh mixers that can be mixed prior to heating. Storage is easy since this does not need refrigeration. Just add water to the pasta, snap on the lid, cook (microwave) for a three minutes, drain the water, add the sauce (from sauce pack) and cook for one minute and enjoy a hot meal. I did not like the Ziti and meat sauce, but if you like meat sauce, this is for you. Other sauces available are; Sesame Teriyaki Chicken, Southwestern Style Chicken, and Sweet & Sour Chicken (see Healthy Choice website). If you have precooked vegetables sitting in the fridge this is the time to use. I would use; cheese (personal favorites are Parmesan or cheddar), broccoli, Bell peppers, garlic, Zucchini squash, or mushrooms, I would recommend combining these with your sauce while heating the mixture. Use your imagination to add or substitute any of the veggies recommended. I liked the ease of the preparation and the separate units containing the sauce for ready mixing with cooked pasta. This product not very innovative, since noodles with dried veggies (in paper tubs) is available.<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZOC">Healthy Choice Chicken Noodle Soup, 14-Ounce Microwave Bowls (Pack of 12)</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZO2">Healthy Choice Chicken with Rice Soup, 14-Ounce Microwave Bowls (Pack of 12)</a><br />3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016862SO">Healthy Choice MW Soup- Chicken Rice 14oz 12ct</a>

These are the mini-size Snickers - each one is about an inch square, so they are much smaller than the version that is offered for Halloween. It's truly a single bite, and a great size for a candy dish. No matter the size, a Snickers always hits the spot!<br /><br />All the candy comes packed in a single plastic bag in one box.

review/summary: One of the Best Soda Drinks in the World
review/text: My sister introduced me to Virgil's Black Cherry Cream Soda earlier this year. I've tried many sodas in my lifetime, and I have to honestly say that Virgil's Black Cherry Cream Soda is one of the best tasting drinks I've ever had. I can't really describe it, but I feel happy when I drink this. I love any cherry-flavored or orange-flavored drinks. Anyways, it's very pleasing to the tastebuds. And it goes down smoothly. I also love Virgil's Orange Cream Soda, Root Beer, and Real Cola. Usually, I would normally drink Glaceau Vitaminwater, particularly Focus (Thank you, Kelly Clarkson to introducing us to Focus flavor - she was the first spokesperson for Focus Glaceau Vitaminwater), or different brands of water. I usually drink healthy drinks. But if I want to reward myself with something indulgent - Virgil's different flavored cream sodas are my indulgent drink treat. Try it, you'll like it. I thank my sister for introducing me to this amazing soda.

review/text: This Virgil's Black Cherry creme soda drink tastes exactly like cherry cough syrup. Horribly over sweetened & over flavored by a factor of Ten. This beverage is positively undrinkable. I unfortunately bought a case of it. It is positively sickening. One swallow is more than enough. I'll have to pour the 24 bottles down the drain because these are unusable unless someone wants to pour it over ice cream & use it as a cherry syrup. Perhaps some grade school child might be able to tolerate it. I love creme soda but this is absolutely horrible.<br /><br />Virgil's plain Creme soda isn't much better. It tastes like root beer instead of creme soda.<br /><br />There is a Hawaiian brand of creme soda with cane sugar which is wonderful. But only available in limited supplies. Waialua creme soda. Be sure to spell it CREME not cream. Otherwise it wont come up. It is only available at limited times in limited quantities on this site but is the best I've ever tasted.

(seafood, vegetables, miso, seaweed, etc) Pricing is very good on these as well, and with amazon's free shipping they are far more affordable for me than driving 100 mile round trip to the nearest large town with an asian grocery that carries them.

review/summary: One of the best vanillas you will taste and at a great price
review/text: I discovered Orlando Vanilla a few years ago while spending a week in Puerto Vallarta. I am a chef and specialize in pastries so a good vanilla is important. I've tried Nielsen Massey vanillas and they are excellent but they still have a bit of a chemical/alcohol scent to them. McCormick extract (the most commonly found at your local supermarket) is so strong alcohol-wise that once you've had good vanilla you'll never go back to cheap chemical tasting junk.<br /><br />Orlando vanilla (and their other brand La Reyna) is strong, smells sweet with no chemical notes.  The aroma of vanilla permeates the kitchen when you use it. It is very reasonably priced and since most recipes call for about a teaspoon of vanilla you will find that an eight ounce bottle like this gives you enough for 48 typical recipes. Depending on your taste or the strength you are looking for you might get fewer or more portions.<br /><br />I buy mine from Puerto Vallarta when I go. I usually buy two liters (a liter is a bit more than a quart) and this year I have a tour of the factory scheduled. Kept in a cool, dark place vanilla extract has an extremely long shelf life so no need to worry about spoilage. I don't think you can go wrong using this extract. The only other way to get better flavor is to use good quality vanilla pods (see my review on those if you are interested)

review/summary: Think of it as a treat
review/text: Okay, what are these, about a dollar a piece. Let's face it, that's not cheap. Depending on how you look at it, it can be a good deal. I will not pay for my kids to have these as a part of their everyday diet. I can have them split an organic piece of fresh fruit for half the price. BUT, if you think of them as a healthy treat, they are so worth it. You wouldn't think twice about spending a dollar on a box of candy, right?<br /><br />Moving on from price: the fruit is simple and tastes great. In the fridge they get nice and chilly, which is a nice treat. The package is literally like a Capri Sun with a thick straw coming out the top. This is fun for a child who is maybe 3 or older. However, a younger child is going to squeeze this everywhere. I hold it for my 1 year old, because he would find it fun to make a huge, expensive mess with this.<br /><br />Bottom line, I will use these as a treat for the kids, and buy them again for that purpose.

review/text: Just Fruit - the name says it all. In these pouches is a sweet, simple peach puree that is made with no preservatives, no fillers, no sugar, no salt; just fruit. My toddler loves these, slurping them up with enthusiasm whenever he's handed one. All he needs to know is that they're yummy. I like knowing they're organic, healthy, and so very easy to keep on hand. I've got some stashed in my diaper bag for snacking on the go, and I've been known to slurp 'em up, too!

review/summary: Good supplement to fresh fruit
review/text: I prefer fresh organic fruit over anything processed, even if the only ingredient is "organic peaches". That said, sometimes it's just not convenient (when you're traveling) or possible (winter) to provide good fresh fruit for your kids.  That's where these come in.  These are very convenient when you are on the go.  Don't need to worry about heavy glass jars breaking in the diaper bag, don't need to worry about utensils - just squeeze directly into your kids mouth.<br /><br />Slightly pricey, but the subscribe and save cost on Amazon is probably the best out there.

review/text: I have a picky toddler and she LOVES these pouches, followed by the green ones with applesauce (made by another brand I don't recall, also sold on Amazon, with yellow tops). These are very easy to travel with and are resealable. We have not had any trouble with them leaking or exploding, though my daughter sometimes squeezes the full ones too hard and makes a mess. I have these on subscribe & save and would suggest these pouches to a friend.

review/text: I give these to my 6 month old son frequently and he loves it! I personally think it has a great taste...I am not sure about other reviewers who didn't like the taste...but in my opinion the taste is that of fresh, juicy peaches. Obviously it's super healthy...organic and nothing added. It is crazy runny so that makes it pretty messy if you are spoon feeding it. I made my own baby food with fresh organic peaches and the Plum brand tasted better...so why waste my time peeling and making the stuff when I can just buy it. We love this product!

review/summary: Simple, Clear Ingredients- Wonderful!!
review/text: I bought the peaches for my son while looking at all the baby food at Target.  This is the only brand I have found not to use peach puree and concentrate, along with a bunch of other processing -- I love it!  The biggest draw back is the price.  Earth's best baby food is the only other brand that tends to have fewer ingredients and processing, but the biggest difficulty is find the correct fruit or vegetable by itself (not in a mix, same with Plum.) But if you can do this brand even for treats or snacks for your kids, please support their effort of simple nutrition.

review/text: I've purchased this 2lb bag from this same seller a few times now. They're GREAT when I'm trying to fight off a cold. These plus a nice strong hot cup of tea and I feel almost instantly better. They soothe my throat, help fight my cough and just in general make long hours of being on the phone far more pleasurable.<br /><br />This seller is wonderful too - to find a bag this large for this price is very hard as these candies/cough drops aren't very popular (though I can't understand why as they're so fantastic). Being able to find such a large amoung instead of having to buy them in a small package one at a time is very convenient for me.<br /><br />Beyond that, despite paying for the shipping I still end up saving more on this then I would going through just about any other seller. I've even found these in specialty candy stores and they can be very expensive. The packages always arrive very quickly, and very well packaged. I'm very pleased with these drops AND with this seller.

review/summary: The right kind of sweet!
review/text: Growing up on Root Beer and Cream Soda, I just have a warm spot in my soul for anything with that sweet creamy aftertaste, and oogave's wonderful Watermelon Cream does just the trick for my tongue.  I love watermelon too, which certainly helps, but what I love so much about this stuff is that it doesn't overload the senses with an overtly rich watermelon flavor.  Watermelon as a fruit is also pretty subtle, containing mostly water and so it has a soft flavor that makes it so refreshing.  This soft-drink is the epitome of refreshing.  This is also one of the best showcases for oogave's subtler, more relaxed carbonation (it lacks the aggressive `sizzle' that most sodas attack your throat with).  There are times, especially with oogave's Ginger Ale, where the lack of carbonated explosion makes the drink taste more savory and less refreshing than other soda's, but here the softer set on your palate is very nice.  This is my favorite oogave flavor at the moment, and it is certainly one I highly recommend to all.  Sweet, fruity and refreshing; this one covers all bases!

I have tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUOH26">Zevia Natural Diet Soda, Twist, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>; this tastes far superior.

review/text: I just bought this soda today at the Fresh Market, because it was made with agave nectar. I was blown away by how wonderful the taste was. I tried the Root Beer and the Watermelon Cream and I like them both. However, I think so far Watermelon Cream is my favorite. I would and will recommend this to anyone. Especially if they have diabetes or want a sugar alternative. This is a real treat. It has no aftertaste and tastes like a regular soda. It is a better choice than any of the other sugar substitute, diet sodas. This is the best!

review/text: The trick with smoked or salk cured ham, is you need to skin it then soak what your gunna eat in water for a while to extract the salt.  It will still be salty but not as bad. You can always dress it with the tradtional pinapple or brown sugar for that sweet and salty taste.  Thin slices also help.  I am SOO sorry to hear about your Easter Ham.  I had a very similar incident with a smoked turkey for Christmas.  It was over smoked and the meat had turned to paste. Hope this helps.

review/text: I tried this olive oil out of curiosity and I really am happy with it. Olio Santo, "the oil of saints"<br /><br />It has a delicious flavor, great for cooking, salads, drizzled on bread,etc.<br /><br />I don't mind paying a little more for great taste and quality.<br /><br />I recommend you give it a try or one of the other olive oils from Stonehouse Olive oil, made right here in the U.S.

review/summary: Wonderful. Great Taste
review/text: This is a nice tasting olive oil. We have been using this to make salad dressings and they always turn out well. I have also used this to make dipping sauces for bread and drizzled it on pasta. I think it is a lovely color.  This has always had a consistent quality and taste. I have also used this to make some small scale, home production, beauty products and they have turned out nice and have not had an overwhelming olive oil smell. I really like this olive oil and would suggest that anyone try it when they are looking for a good, not horribly expensive type of olive oil.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: THE BEST
review/text: I've never been much of a fan of olive oil. I found grocery store brands tasted bitter and/or left an aftertaste. I rarely used the full amount in a recipe. Then I read what the Barefoot Contessa uses the Olio Santo brand. I decided to give it a try and what a difference. It has a very light fruity note. It makes a big difference in my recipes. It's worth the price. Love it!

review/summary: chips great, description less than one star
review/text: ORIGINAL REVIEW: 1/5 stars<br /><br />First off, I would like to say that these chips are very tasty and the ingredients don't intimidate.<br /><br />The problem with this item is that it is stated that there are 24 - 24 oz bags of chips. There are actually 24 - 1 oz bags of chips. HUGE difference 24X24 not equal to 24X1!<br /><br />I am very disappointed in amazon for allowing such a discrepancy in this listing. Please fix this, and tomorrow I hope to find a resolution to this dishonesty.<br /><br />Then I will gladly change this to the 5 star review it should be.<br /><br />****************************************************************<br />EDITED 4/26/12: 4/5 stars<br /><br />I am very happy with Amazon fixing the description. These are 24 1.25oz bags of chips, not 24 24oz bags of chips. The seller I bought from, Stronger Nutrition, was very quick to help me resolve this issue with Amazon, and we should all be thankful to have that cleared up.<br /><br />The chips, like I said are very good. They do have a slightly salty aftertaste, but are so delicious I wish they were 24oz bags! I think they are onto something with the avocado oil. It seems to blend well with potato.<br /><br />The problem remains that this listing for these chips is way overpriced compared to another listing of them, so you don't want to buy them here.

review/summary: slightly bitter but very nice
review/text: You have to expect 85% dark chocolate to be at least slightly bitter and these bars are just that.  If you are a sweet freak you will hate these bars.  I like them.  I'm always on the lookout for fair trade organic chocolate brands that do not cost an arm and a leg and ordered a case lot box of these from my food club at a very good sale price.<br /><br />These bars are made from whole ground cocoa beans (cacao) rather than from processed cocoa powder.  That makes them more healthy than most.  And because of the high cacao content you get a lot less sugar per ounce.  AND because they are not sweet and do not melt as smoothly in the mouth as some other brands (ex. Chocolove), I tend to eat less and that is even better for my health (and pocketbook).<br /><br />If you are looking for a dark chocolate to complement a dry red wine, I feel that this is not a good choice.<br /><br />Personally, I'm happy to have the Theo bars in rotation with the other 3 brands which I purchase.  If you are not sure about the 85% cacao experience, splurge and buy one bar at a retail store before you order in bulk.

review/summary: Great Noodles!
review/text: I've been eating these noodles since childhood.  My parents would buy these noodles by the boxes from the Asian grocery store.  Maybe, I'm partial, but these noodles are consistently good.  Simply add water and any vegetables, and you'll have a delicious meal.  These style of noodles are sold at restaurants for probably at least $5, so buying this and eating it at home is a an effective use of money.  I have tried the other flavors but I recommend shrimp as the best Udon flavor.

review/summary: best "instant" udon noodles I've had
review/text: Having sampled a variety of both dried and instant type udon noodles I have found that Myojo's are some of the best. The noodles are always pleasantly textured and the flavor packets are tasty, but not so overpowering that you can't add things to your soup to make it a meal. (seafood, vegetables, miso, seaweed, etc) Pricing is very good on these as well, and with amazon's free shipping they are far more affordable for me than driving 100 mile round trip to the nearest large town with an asian grocery that carries them.

review/summary: These noodles are close to fresh made.
review/text: The noodles that come with this pack are already cooked and soft and vacuum-sealed. They're like authentic fresh udon noodles. Just don't overcook them, no more than three minutes at a full boil, otherwise they get too soggy/soft. The soup base is rather plain (as with all of their flavors) but it isn't meant to taste like oriental-style ramen noodle soup seasoning packets. This really is meant to be garnished with vegetables for a more complete meal, otherwise it doesn't seem very substantial. One serving per package. About 280 cal and 1.5 grams (1500 mg) sodium per pack/serving. OUCH! But that's common for these soups anyway.

review/summary: Delightfully delicate green tea
review/text: I hate green tea.  I endured it for my health.  Until I found THIS tea.  This one lacks the up-front bitterness I have found in so many other green teas. It is ethereal, delicate in flavor and fragrance. I was surprised to find that I loved it and actually missed it when I ran out.  The secret: don't steep too long and drink it before it gets cold. Delightful cup of tea.

review/summary: Sriracha with a hint of Chipotle
review/text: Let me first say that I love Sriracha and have been buying the more popular brand (the one with the Rooster); and that I go through a LOT of Sriracha.  This Sriracha is not trying to be a knock-off of the other brand.  It has a distinctly different flavor.  That said, I like it as much -if not more so- than the other leading brand.  While it seems this is not as hot as the other Sriracha (which is sort of a con) it makes up for it with a smoky, chipotle-like flavor.  If you buy Sriracha just for the sweet-hot flavor this may not be for you, but if you like your hot sauces with a smoky, chipotle/roasted habanero flavor and a little less heat, this one is for you!

review/summary: New recipe is horrible, stay away!
review/text: I've been drinking and enjoying the Gevalia Swiss Hazelnut since I purchased my Tassimo machine a year ago, and would routinely buy it in 2 and 3 packs from Amazon.  I recently noticed that the packaging had changed, but assumed it was packaging only.  I was wrong - the coffee in the new packaging is made with a new "formula" and it is HORRIBLE, overly sweet and artificial tasting.  You can't even taste a hint of coffee flavor.  Stay away from this blend!<br /><br />My hope is that this is just an issue with a production run or this blend, and the other redesigned Gevalia t-discs actually taste like coffee.<br /><br />UPDATE: I called Tassimo Direct and complained about the new Gevalia Swiss Hazelnut t-discs.  They were nice enough to offer me a refund/exchange and I went ahead and ordered replacement t-discs in a different blend.  I hope these will work out much better.  I encourage those that are unhappy with this new product to call them, voice a complaint and get a refund/exchange.

review/text: I fell in love with this flavor - the original recipe.  I did the subscribe and save option to that I'd always have plenty on hand.  I had to cancel it and will not buy this again.  I don't know what they changed in the recipe, it now tastes horrible!  I can't even finish a whole cup.  I have to throw it out after only a few sips.  I'm a bit of a coffee snob, but I'll drink taster's choice instant over this.  I'd highly recommend you do not order this flavor.  It's worse than swill.

review/summary: New formula is TERRIBLE!
review/text: I have been a fan of Gevalia's Swiss Hazelnut for about two years...however the new formula in the new packaging/logo from Tassimo is HORRENDOUS! The original formula had subtle hazelnut flavor that tasted like it was in the roast itself....the new tastes like they added a cheap shot of hazelnut syrup and a couple of vanilla shots to boot! This is nothing like the original, which had a medium roast taste, the new brew is watery, sickly sweet and off putting. Please beware this is not the same brew as the old packaging. Unfortunately, I cannot return this item and am now stuck with this terrible coffee.
