review/summary: Hmmmmmm......!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: My mother's friend used to make cookie bars and give it to us as a small friendly gesture when I was little so when I was at the grocery store I splurged on some chubs food during finals week and me and my roommate shared it while studying for finals. Delicious and lasts for about five days while still keeping its flavor and not getting too 'gummy.' After a few days the chocolate does start to taste a bit cheap, and you become aware that its just some cheap brownie mix, but for most people (families?) it shouldn't even last that long! Try Zingerman's if you like gourmet!

review/summary: Quick & Easy Chocolate Chip Cookie Brownie Bars
review/text: What do you get when you combine chocolate chip cookies with brownies?  Chocolate Chip Cookie Brownie Bars - the best of both worlds!  I love to bake from scratch but also appreciate the convenience of packaged mixes, especially for busy home bakers, and am having fun experimenting with them.<br /><br />I tried this quick and easy mix from Betty Crocker for the first time yesterday and will definitely be making it again.  These cookie brownie bars have the look of fancy from scratch cookie bars and good flavor and texture.  Easy to mix up, they were done to perfection in the stated time specified on the box.  They were a big hit when I served them for dessert with vanilla ice cream last night.

review/summary: On a quest for the perfect light-roast
review/text: I am currently going through the selection of light-roast coffee beans Amazon has to offer on a quest for the perfect light-roast coffee.  I drink a cup of coffee every morning.  In general, my bags of coffee beans last quite a while so like some tea connoisseurs, I don't mind spending a little more on the good stuff.<br /><br />This coffee is great.  When you see the beans in the bag, it's obvious this is a light roast unlike others that claim to be.<br /><br />It's a very good blend of beans that won't leave that bitter left-over taste on the sides of your tongue like darker roasts or many that claim to be light roast coffees that really aren't.  Even if you make it strong, the color is very reddish.  Extremely smooth taste.<br /><br />Recently, I served this at a family party and even with the pies and cakes for desert, people were asking about the coffee and talking about how good it was.<br /><br />Obviously, this is one of the better light roasts out there.<br />--- Edit Jul 12, 2012 ---<br />This is the best light roast out there.  After trying many different brands, I've found most companies do not know how to do a light roast.  Starbuck's Blonde is laughable and equivalent to most French roasts.  Other light roasts from other lesser-known and better-known brands I've tried so far all introduce strange unsavory flavors/bitterness or have no right to call their coffee 'light roast' because the beans are just plain barbecued.<br /><br />At this point, since I prefer light roasts, Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Kona Blend is the best coffee I've ever had.  I might still try others, but I'll keep coming back to this as a point of comparison.

review/summary: The Best Granola!
review/text: I've been eating this brand of granola since it first appeared at my Whole Foods. I particulary love the Vanilla Almond Crunch "Cereal" which I use like granola over my fruit and yogurt. I love that it is sweetened naturally and is low in fat. If you want a traditional granola, I also really like the Peak Protein. It is great for snacking right out of the bag and since I don't eat meat, the extra protein is needed. It kind of tastes a little like an oatmeal cookie to me. I've tried all their flavors and these are the only two I like, although I will say my husband is partial to the fruit and nut. There is a flavor for everyone!

review/summary: Bear Naked Vanilla Almond Crunch
review/text: I never dreamed I would purchase cereal on line! However I had been purchasing this brand at a local market until it became so expensive the store dropped the line. Since I had been eating it mixed with yogurt almost daily for the past 6 months, I wanted to find a new source to continue purchasing it. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. We were also VERY pleased that the cereal from this supplier seems to be fresher than the store where I use to purchase it. The shipping time was excellent and cost reasonable. The cereal is flavorful, low calorie for my diet, and full of nutrition.  I also enjoy it as a healthy snack. I have tried most of the other flavors in this line and find this one to be the best.

review/text: I wondered about 6 bags of this FANTASTIC granola at once, but the packages are small (12 ounces) and I figure I use one per month so went the 6 month subscription route which means Amazon will ship it to me once every 6 months. This dropped price per package to $2.97 from $3.50 (I usually pay $3.99 at Kroger).<br /><br />Great cereal, nutritious and a yogurt must!

review/text: I have been ordering this as a "subscribe and save" for months now, and have been happy with the product and the quality that I receive.  However, the last order I received--which arrived in a sealed box--contained two punctured bags in the box. Though I imagine they are probably fine, they could have been tampered with or they could have been infested with bugs. Unfortunately, I'm not sure what can be done about the problem, so I'm writing this review.  It may make me reluctant to continue placing orders through Amazon.

I suppose if you subscribed and saved (and bought in bulk) if might be worth it - if you even liked the taste and texture.  Nature's Path organic granolas win the prize for best granolas in my book.

review/summary: Great taste but watch the sodium
review/text: As others have said, Flavacol is the missing ingredient that makes your popcorn taste like it does in the theater. I don't even use butter anymore. I make about three 8oz servings of popcorn for our outdoor movie night and I use only 3 teaspoons of the stuff. I'm not sure I'll make it through the box in a year.<br /><br />Be aware, that the 1 teaspoon serving size carries over 1100mg of sodium. You probably aren't going to eat the whole 8oz yourself, but it was a bit of an eye-opener when I found out.<br /><br />Make sure you add this to the oil in the pot or popcorn kettle you are cooking the popcorn in. This is not to be sprinkled over the top of your air-popped popcorn. I would recommend cooking in coconut oil for the best flavor.

Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store.

review/text: ... not like salt, not like preservatives, not like an over seasoned concoction?  Can you believe tomatoes can look like tomatoes, not like they've been chopped up to pieces? Yes - Muir Glen tomatoes taste like tomatoes and look like tomatoes.  I buy their diced tomato cans at my local warehouse club. The taste is unbelievable. They are flesh, smell amazing, and the tomatoes inside are so sweet and juicy.  I make pasta sauses, I also make chili, and I now only use these tomatoes, even skipping fresh ones and tomato paste.<br /><br />Ingredients in diced tomato can [I'm sure very similar to whole tomatoes]: organic tomatoes and tomato juice; salt, naturally derived citric acid and calcium chloride.  That's it!

review/summary: Exquisite Jasmine Tea, Not To Be Missed
review/text: *****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified special grade green tea that is scented with real summer jasmine flowers from China. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea, and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province. The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms. During summer, these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea, naturally embracing all of the flowers' scent. When brewed, this smooth, organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight. It is a most romantic tea, and, like a bowl of fresh picked flowers, will bring the joy of summer to your every sip." It sounds quite romantic, and it tastes wonderful. It is a true jasmine tea, and the taste of jasmine predominates, in a both strong and lovely way.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love jasmine green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Life-changing Hash
review/text: I was a bit skeptical to see a can of corned beef hash in the gourmet food section, but I had never tasted corned beef or its famous hash, and it was time. I hesitantly added it to my cart and rushed through checkout before I could change my mind.<br /><br />I'm so glad I took the risk. It might have been impulsive, but sometimes dreams can come true. This hash changed the way I see myself-- I mean, let's face it: it saved my marriage. If you have any doubts about this product, abandon them now. Armour Corned Beef Hash is godlike in its simplicity, lifelike in its sensations, and unparalleled in quality.

review/text: This is the best commercial corned beef hash today. I especially like that it's less salty than competitive brands--not just because I have to be careful of my sodium intake, but you actually taste the product instead of salt. I find it extremely annoying that stores around here (southern Connecticut) no longer carry the product. On the other hand, the prices are good and I don't have to worry about buying it all the time.

review/summary: Good Quality - worth trying.
review/text: I have several cats and have made a point over the years to feed them high quality cat foods.  My female at 15 years was getting oily coat and would not move around much...she just didn't seem to being doing well.  I read "Natural Cat" and had a real eye opener to what is really in these pet foods - even the higher quality ones.  I shifted the cats to "Pet Guard" wet and dry food. Premium feast is a great flavor they love. Within 2 weeks, the female's coat was 1/2 as oily plus she was moving around measurably more than before.<br /><br />After a month and a bath with Pure Castille soap - she is oil free and doing Great. She also lost a 1 lb which I attribute to better nutrition proteins and not fillers.  I also use Organix Cat food.  Consumers need to educate themselves on GMO (genetically engineered corns, soy etc.) - not only is this crap in our foods now but heavy in pet foods...I am true believer shifting to Organic, even in the pet foods, is our best bet. I mix it with Tabby Tab or Nu-Cat vitamins as well as PetGuard Anitra's Vita-Mineral Mix Natural Pet Supplement - Huge benefit.<br /><br />Stay away from Tuna fish - I know they love it - I used to feed premium whole tuna cat food fillets but it is not good for them -plus the mercury content is always a factor. PetGuard does have a seafood flavor they like and it does not have tuna.  Good luck!

review/summary: Full-Flavored Tea for Daily Use
review/text: I have always enjoyed tea, but I started drinking it regularly when I lived in England during college.  The school I went to served PG Tips, and once I returned to the United States, I could not find anything dark enough for me.  Eventually, I found it in a store in NYC but then had to order more from an online import retailer.  When we got a World Market in my city, I was able to buy it there.  However, I now order it from Amazon because of the price and convenience.<br /><br />I recommend buying one 40 or 80 bag box at a time because it will lose flavor over a couple of years if purchased in bulk amounts.<br /><br />Pros<br />Easy to vary how dark it gets, but this tea will brew a very dark cup if desired -- which is what I love about it.<br />Cost -- This price on Amazon is excellent and while there are probably "finer" teas out there, PG Tips is high quality yet inexpensive enough to drink daily.<br />While it states on the box that it is low in caffeine, two large cups pack plenty of get-you-going punch.<br /><br />Cons<br />Nope, no string.  I never remove my tea bag from the cup, though, so this isn't a problem for me.  A spoon works great.<br />You'll never feel the same about the tea you can buy at a grocery store in the U.S.  Very few, if any, have enough flavor.

review/text: I just purchased this tea because I was looking for a simple, inexpensive, and great tasting black tea.  I read the other reviews for PG tips (which were great) so I bought some.  So the outcome?<br /><br />It's excellent. It steeps very quickly and has a nice strong taste.  My mother (at first) noticed that the teabags didn't have strings and said something to the effect of "yeah usually if the tea is of cheaper quality it doesn't have strings..." or something weird like that.  Lets just say she quickly got over that and she now makes this tea constantly.  Highly recommended for an inexpensive black tea.  Lets just say the brits know their tea!

review/summary: Robust tea flavor. Very happy with it.
review/text: I actually bought a small box of this tea just to try it out. I used it for a few weeks and thought "That was good, but nothing special." But after 2 weeks of being back on my old tea, I miss it. So I'm buying some more. :) My normal US tea is Newmans Organic or Luzianne, so that's all I have to compare it to.<br /><br />Note: Each PG bag has about 2 times the weight of tea that 1 bag of a US tea bag has. Or put another way, 2 PG bags equal 1 "family" bag of US tea. So while it looks more expensive, in the long run it's not really. In fact, I can make a full gallon of ice tea with just 8 of these bags. So the price is about the same or better, and the tea tastes better in my opinion.

review/summary: Very robust black tea - I like it
review/text: Strangely enough, I had never heard of this tea until I saw a mention of it in a novel I read recently. I looked it up and found that it's one of the most popular teas in England. As a brewed tea lover, I ordered a small box from Amazon. Now I'm enjoying PG Tips very much, and I'll probably try the decaf version, since I can't drink caffeinated tea at night.<br /><br />The tea is very dark and robust with a pungent aroma, reminding me a bit of Irish Breakfast Tea. I drink my tea straight, but PG Tips is strong enough that I think it should hold up well if sugar and cream were added.<br /><br />I imagine that a specialty import shop may have it, but our local Publix doesn't carry PG Tips, so I'll keep buying it from Amazon. With Amazon's price and free Prime 2-day shipping, PG Tips is very affordable, especially in the larger boxes.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is that the bag has no string and tab, so I have to fish it out of my Mr. Coffee. The bag would fit in my tea infuser, but it's easier to just fish it out of the pot.

review/text: I drink lots of tea, and I must say that this is a pretty enjoyable variety. The flavor is deep and hearty, and creates a nice dark brew.<br />My parents thought that it was a bit 'too strong', but I think that it is right-on (although one teabag can be used to make several perfectly good cups of tea).<br />If you're looking to try something new, I would definitely recommend that you give this a shot.<br /><br />It didn't totally blow me away, so I can't give it 5 stars - some loose tea (not in bags) that I have tried has been more flavorful, so that's why this gets a solid 4.

review/summary: JUST LIKE IN LONDON, ENGLAND
review/text: My wife and I tried this tea while vacationing in London, England.  Very smooth and provided a decent example of what a good cup of English tea is about.  We were pleasantly surprised that Amazon offered this brand of tea.  We love Amazon!<br /><br />Preparation:  While attending tea presentations in China and England, what was consistent is the use of a ceramic/stoneware type tea pot; heat the water to near boiling (small bubbles); pre-heat tea pot (pour some hot water, swirl and pour out); put two tea bags in the tea pot ("one for the pot and one for the cup"); pour the hot water in tea pot; stir; close lid; then time for 5 minutes; and then serve.  Its good to have the tea with sugar and milk (or cream), and of course your favorite biscuit.  Once you enjoyed tea this way, going back to Lipton tea is just not the same.  Enjoy! :)

And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Good Engery Shots - Recommended
review/text: This set of Mio Energy "Liquid Water Enhancers" includes three bottles, one "Green Thunder" and two "Black Cherry" flavored. I am an energy drink fan and have developed a taste for the stuff, so liked the flavor of these quite a bit more than my wife that hardly ever uses energy drinks (more of a coffee purist).<br /><br />The "Green Thunder" reminds me of Mountain Dew with a hint of apple flavoring and the "Black Cherry" tastes like, well, Black Cherries. I personally prefer the "Green Thunder" but my teen son and my wife like the flavor of the "Black Cherry" better.<br /><br />These do provide a decent energy boost and the portable bottle makes it convenient to carry with me since they do not have to be refrigerated after opening. Three short squirt into a 9oz cup of water seems to provide the best tasting mix for my tastes.<br /><br />These are great as a mid-afternoon pick me up, recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: This is a pretty good product. It has 18 shots in a little bottle, so you get a decent amount of energy boosting for a low price. The taste of the black cherry is good-I don't care for the green flavor. Each serving has 10% each of vitamins B3, B6, and B12, all of which help to keep your energy up.  It also contains guarana and ginseng, which can help boost energy. It has zero calories in a serving and 60 milligrams of caffeine, which is about the same amount of caffeine as in a 6 ounce cup of coffee. I give it four stars because it doesn't perform as well as Five Hour Energy, but it costs a lot less, gives a decent jump start for a couple of hours, and I have not experienced a crash.

review/summary: 5 Hour Energy convert
review/text: I've been a 5 Hour Engergy fanatic for quite some time, but I'm switching over to Mio Energy.  The B6 and B12 vitamins definitely give you a boost, and being able to squirt it in your water allows you to adjust for your own personal taste.  The 3 count box comes with 2 Black Cherry and 1 Green Thunder.  The Black Cherry tastes like cherries (big surprise there), and the Green Thunder looks like Mountain Dew, and kind of tastes the same.<br /><br />I thought I would be a big Black Cherry fan, but I prefer the Green Thunder.  Mio is more convenient than coffee or tea, and doesn't give you the jitters. The bottles don't leak at all, and cleanly squirt a thin stream.  I've yet to make a mess with these.<br /><br />If you're looking for a vitamin-based energy solution, I'd recommend it. Try picking up a single bottle first (Green Thunder!), and deciding from there.

review/summary: Taste great..
review/text: These are so convenient! It helps me keep on top of my necessary water amounts through out the day. Not a huge water drinker but this helps keep me from drinking pop when I want something flavorful. I should have looked at the package because it is not actually three different kinds, it is two of one kind and one of the other.. and it did not come in a box with was scary at first but then I saw the plastic guard around the top of the bottle so you know it was not opened or used prior to receiving it which made it better. I gave it four stars because I find no energy boost in this. I try so many different things and maybe it is just me but a lot do not work. I have found that coffee and energy drinks (e.g. rockstar) are all that actually boost my energy. This and the 5 hr energy does nothing for me at all. If you are not used to much caffeine it probably works. My friend never drinks any and if she has too much (like an energy drink) she feels very sick so this for her gives her a nice boost without it. Some people who use it have told me it makes them sick to their stomach and others say it taste like watered down Gatorade. I like it, but it just depends on your taste I guess. I think you should absolutely try it for yourself because you can never really go by what someone says!

This just adds a nice portability to fresh dog food and I do mean it came fresh. I have bought this same brand at the store before and it was not fresh plus I paidd a higher price per can.

review/summary: Damaged Cans
review/text: Refunded due to damaged cans.  Amazon customer service was friendly and apologetic. Good price and delivery was prompt but I have elderly dogs and cannot risk any chance of bacteria from a broken seal on canned food.  Packaging was poor. They need to better protect their product.  The star review is strictly for the company shipping the product NOT Amazon.com

review/summary: Convient food for my dog
review/text: When i initially purchased this item for my dog, i was a bit nervous. I had given her the food (and had slightly heated it up) and she smelled it and walked away.  Now, however i do not heat it...and she eats it.  The reason i heated it was because she had preferred it with past wet food, but obviously this was better at room temperature.
