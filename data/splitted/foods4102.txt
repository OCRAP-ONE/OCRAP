review/summary: Healthy and Tasty Snack Cherry-Dark Chocolate Bars
review/text: A nutritionist recommended Kashi products and bars to me.  When you want a little bit of chocolate, these don't quite replace a Snickers Candy Bar or Chocolate Chip Cookie, but they come close enough for me.  They're a non-guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is good for you, say health experts.  These also pack 5g protein and 4g(15%) of fiber.  Only 8g of sugar (a Snickers candy bar has 28.8 g of sugar by comparison or almost 4X the sugar of these Kashi bars--nutritionists say your body burns sugar BEFORE fat as it's easier to burn so your body will keep the fat.) These are only 120 calories per bar vs. 280 calories in a Snickers bar--not to pick on Snickers but it demonstrates why these are healthier than most candy bars.  I like to take them in the car when I'm running errands and need something to tide me over, or they're a tasty after-meal treat.<br /><br />A confession: I grabbed this box by accident at the grocery store thinking I was buying this Kashi bar: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DHNIBG">Kashi TLC Chewy Granola Bar, Dark Mocha Almond, 6-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a> which is my absolute favorite.  I generally like my chocolate straight-up and not mixed with fruit.  However, as an alternative, the cherry taste is refreshing although I think the dark chocolate taste, which I love, is stronger in the other bar with the almonds.  Family members may prefer this one, however.  So, it's great to have two healthy treats in the house that are better nutrition than a candy bar or cookie.<br /><br />If you like the taste of cherry with chocolate, you may want to try these bars.

review/summary: Tastes Good, not the best quality of bean
review/text: I'm a home roaster, and I really enjoy coffee. This blend does taste good when roasted. My reason for 4 stars is the quality of bean is not the best. I had to sort through it to find rocks and bad beans before roasting. This was the first time I had to do that with this company. Not a big problem, I paid less than the fancier ones. The beans roast well, but turn out less attractive than the higher quality beans. If I was stretched for money I would purchase this product again, but I would probably pony up for some higher quality beans next time.

review/summary: Coffee
review/text: Been home roasting for two years now. I use an I-Roast II, but stop by sound, sight and smell. I would not recommend the light roast that the company claims it is blended for. The mixture of bean types and sizes just do not really allow all of the beans to roast to same level. This is true of a darker roast as well, but at least all the beans make it to/through first crack. Not the best blend I've experienced, but satisfactory. I roast at FC+, with some beans falling into the french roast catagory. Tough to beat the price and the beans were dry. I'll buy again, but not too soon. May give some of their others a try. Arrived very quickly. That impressed me. I usually buy from Sweet Maria's but their arrival is usually about a week or so. My decision to buy was more out of a need to get some beans quickly, as I was down to my last couple of roasts of the beans I had left. Give this one a try. It may be to your taste. It will still certainly taste better than folger's, no matter how melange the roast.

review/summary: A Tasty, Less Sugary Granola from Kashi
review/text: I actually like Kashi's new commercials about how healthy ingredients need to taste good to be in their cereals, and then they show a somewhat overweight guy as a food researcher going into various third world situations to find them, Indiana Jones-style. I had an opportunity to try Kashi's GoLean Crunch! Cereal in a sample packet as part of a promotional package Amazon sent me of their non-perishable groceries. Full of their Seven Whole Grains and Sesame cereal, it is indeed tasty without the overwhelming clusters of sweeter granola cereals. There is some of the sawdust taste of barley and soybean in there, but the whole oats and brown rice manage to dominate with honey, cinnamon, evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup adding a dash of sweetness. A cup is 190 calories, which is higher than my favorite, Kashi's Heart to Heart cereal, but it does have only 95 mg of sodium and 8 grams of fiber. It's definitely a worthwhile entry in the granola category.

review/text: This is a tasty, relatively healthy cereal which probably goes well with milk.  I don't know as I don't drink milk, but it works for me as a snack.  Better to nibble on this than sugar-laden or fat-laden commercial "snack foods" IMHO.  It does have some rye & wheat so if you are very sensitive to gluten, this might be a downer.  I'm somewhat sensitive, but it didn't seem to have much effect on me.  Fortunately, the main ingredients are oats & rice.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Great tasting, great for you!
review/text: This is one of my favorite "healthy" cereals.  It's high in protein and fiber, and doesn't contain artificial ingredients or sweeteners that I can't pronounce.  This cereal also fills me up for most of the morning (unlike many high carb, oversweetened cereals). And, most importantly, it actually tastes good!  The flavor sort of reminds me of Cracker Jack - crunchy and slightly caramel-ly.  I like to add blueberries or dried cranberries to it for a little extra sweetness.  It's also great in yogurt.  My only complaint is that some of the clusters in the cereal are really large, so much so that I have to break them up before eating.  A minor complaint, really.  Overall, I highly recommend Go Lean Crunch!

A bowl is very filling, and here's the amazing part: it actually KEEPS me full. For hours. As for the "clumps" that some people are complaining about, those are my favorite part! It's just a characteristic of the cereal -- kind of like how, sometimes, pizza will have a bubble of dough in it. Mmmm. Love the bubble, love the clumps.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

There are huge round clusters at the top of the box perfect as finger food, but after you get half way or so into the contents most of the rest is small and harder to eat right out of the box.  Still tasty and crunchy, however.<br /><br />Despite the great taste without milk, or in concert as a granola topper of sorts, I find that this cereal causes an inordinate amount of gas buildup in my system.  Hence the rating of 4.  It may be just me, or one of the seven grains is the culprit.  And, despite this realization, I'll continue to eat it primarily because of its great taste and good all-around nutrition.

review/summary: I'm Just Not Addicted...
review/text: With so many other glowing reviews, I feel a little ashamed to put my own lukewarm review in.  Kashi GoLean Crunch! has 7 whole grains in it, which means puffed rice is mixed with oats and rye and other grains to make clusters.  It's naturally sweetened, which is a plus, and it definitely stays crunchy in milk.  Really, really crunchy.  It has sort of a sweet, oat-slightly-nutty flavor to it, and it's not bad.<br /><br />However, as I said, I'm not really addicted to it.  I prefer Back to Nature Granolas, and as I wrote this review, I became curious as to their nutrition facts.  So here is the Kashi measured up against the Back to Nature All-Natural Granola, Apple Blueberry, 15-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6) - measured by 1/2 cup servings.  There are definitely more calories in BTN (200 vs. 95), but there's fruit too, which the Kashi GoLean lacks.  BTN has slightly less sugar (6 g to Kashi's 6.5g), less salt (20 mg to 47.5 mg) and there's more protein in it (6 g to Kashi's 4.5g). They are equal in the following categories: dietary fiber (4g) and calcium (2%); there's more fat in BTN (2.5g=4% BTN, 1.5g=2.5% Kashi).  So there is not a lot of difference between the two.<br /><br />But as for the taste and the texture?  I'd readily take granola any day over the Kashi.  I don't like overly crunchy cereals (why buy a cereal specifically named, "Crunch!" right?) and the granola is crisp enough for me.  There are fewer sharp edges to stab me in the gums.

review/summary: More like Go Lean Chew! instead of usual Crunch! despite current "Use by" date
review/text: While I eat Go Lean Crunch! often -- not least because of the incomparable crunch -- I have been very disappointed with this particular shipment, which has been more chewy than crunchy right from the beginning.  Kind of like it had been opened and then subjected to humidity for too long.  This despite a "Use by" date of 6/2013.  Edible in milk, but otherwise, blech.  Was hoping it was a fluke w/the first box of the 3, but no such luck.  At this point, I can't return it, but if this happens again, I'll have to reconsider where I buy it.

review/summary: Flavored gravel
review/text: This cereal is nutritionally fortified gravel. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. It takes a suspiciously long time to get soggy in milk and it isn't too sweet. Think of it, philosophically, as a less extreme Grape-Nuts.  With some freeze-dried strawberry slices on top it's actually even kind of good. If you are especially into eating healthy cereals or small rocks you would probably like it. I'm going to finish what I have but not go out of my way to purchase this again, because I can only consume so much gravel in a given year.

review/summary: Great cereal, maybe a bit TOO crunchy
review/text: This serial is awesome. I pretty much exclusively eat cereal as a grad student with very little time, and this has to be among my favorite cereals. The crunch can be a bit too hard sometimes (I didn't think such a thing could happen), so I usually let it soak in the milk for little, making sure I get every cluster.<br /><br />I've had a hard inedible bit here and there, but very rarely. In the whole year+ I've been getting these in the mail from Amazon, I've had maybe two or three boxes that showed the anomalous hard bits.<br /><br />Also, its great with soy milk (are there things that arent?).<br /><br />As always, check the expiration date!! I haven't had a spoiled box yet, but you can never be too careful!

review/text: This cereal is amazing.  Tasty, filling, nutritionally balanced, and cheaper than a lot of other premium "healthy" cereals.  I love eating this cereal in the morning for breakfast or after work as a snack.  Really, as far as taste and nutrition, this cereal cannot be beat.<br /><br />However,<br /><br />There is some ingredient in this cereal that causes HORRENDOUS gas in some people.  I am one of them.  Forget beans, peppers, whole grain...all the things that usually cause gas.  This is the worst gas imaginable.  In fact, I am still in awe of how much gas one bowl of this cereal causes.  It is not just the fiber.  I eat a high fiber diet anyway and have never had problems like this...there is some specific ingredient that causes this problem.<br /><br />I would recommend trying this cereal from a store before buying a bunch to see how you react to it.

review/summary: Delicious! But not as healthy as expected
review/text: I'm a type 1 diabetic and am supposed to avoid "bad" foods. Kashi sort of has a reputation for healthier fare, which initially attracted me to this cereal.<br /><br />What a taste! I enjoy the cereal very much; it's crunchy, sweet, and filling. It doesn't taste as processed as lots of common sweet cereals, and isn't bland at all like typical "healthy" cereals.<br /><br />For those without my specific health issues, I'd highly recommend this cereal as it's pretty darn good and relatively healthy. However, it has a pretty high glycemic index and really gives me sugar spikes, so unfortunately after this case I'm done with the product. Farewell Kashi, you sweet seductress of the cereal isle.

review/summary: Definite side effects
review/text: First let me say that I eat a healthy, balanced variety of foods, and am not prone to hardly any bodily disorders.<br />I eat lots of bread and cereal, so this seemed a good choice for supposed good benefits.<br /><br />I noticed after only one bowl, some stomach discomfort and bloating - something I never get save after the massive Thanksgiving dinner.  It lasted 1 full day, and made me wonder...  I ate another bowl 2 days later, and sure enough it happened again.  After checking online I found a vast amount of space already dedicated to the potent side effects of eating Kashi (noxious gas, bloating, diarrhea...)<br /><br />So, a word to the wise - see if any of these symptoms develop coincidentally with the eating of this cereal.  Otherwise it has good flavor - but is overly dry and reminds one of chewing styrophoam...  I guess I'll pass and keep eating my Triscuits and Raisin Bran :)

review/summary: Very tasty and filling, but save for solitary days.
review/text: AS others have said, this cereal is pretty tasty. I like the flavor, although the cereal is pretty crunchy (hard).<br /><br />Despite the good flavor and other positives, BE WARNED!<br /><br />Do not eat this cereal for breakfast if later that day you are:<br />-going on a hot date<br />-having a business meeting<br />-meeting the in-laws for the first time<br />-giving a presentation in front of any number of people<br />-going on a long road trip with other people<br /><br />This cereal is better saved for days when you plan on being a solitary hermit....or are spending the day with someone that doesn't mind (or is highly amused by) explosive flatulence! Holy cow! I bought the 4-pack of these cereal from Amazon several months ago, and I could NOT for the life of me figure out why I've been having such tremendous farts! My long-term boyfriend was initially amused by the frequency and volume of my trumpeting (farts that literally lasted 30 seconds or more), but it's since just become something for him to grimace at. Notably, I ate this for breakfast the morning on the day he proposed to me....Let me just say that our hotel stay that day was less than romantic. Hilariously awful, but not romantic.<br /><br />So, this cereal has its purposes. Despite being a 26 year old woman, fart humor is still a blast (pun!) to me. I might buy it again (I just finished the last box), but I'll just be selective on when to eat it. A Google search for "Kashi gas" reveals that I'm not alone in this.

review/summary: WILL GIVE YOU UNRELENTING GAS
review/text: This is certainly not the worst tasting cereal in the world, not the greatest, but for a health food not bad at all.  The main problem with eating it is that it is a bit too crunchy, and it leaves a very stubborn residue if left in the cereal bowl for an hour.  HOWEVER, the main problem doesn't come when you eat the cereal; it comes about 3 hours after you eat the cereal.  You will be haunted by the most unrelenting gas that you are likely to have ever experienced.  I am positive that GoLEan crunch is responsible because for the last two days that and milk were the only two things I ate and both days I experienced the same tortuous flatulence (I have never had a problem with my milk [Horizon Organic whole]).  The gas isn't particularly smelly but it is frighteningly voluminous.  If you were to consume this product along with a serving of egg curry, you could vanquish your most powerful enemies.

review/summary: Keep Dry To Prevent Clumping!
review/text: For those with clumping problems: I have encountered this too.  It happens when the cereal soaks up too much moisture from the air!  Seal the bag carefully, and if the air where you live is especially moist, you might even consider transferring the cereal to another container that can be sealed airtight.<br /><br />I've been eating this stuff for YEARS and I still love it just as much as I did when I started.  While I think the Honey Almond Flax variant is somewhat tastier, this one does take significantly longer to develop any rancidity.  This may be due to the omission of the flaxseed which contains polyunsaturated linolenic oils which, though healthy, are highly prone to oxidation (I am extremely sensitive to this; my friends and family can't tell and think I'm crazy).  This may be a consideration for you if you are similarly sensitive and take a while to finish the six boxes in this multipack!<br /><br />I share an apartment with two other college-aged guys.  Kashi is really expensive in the grocery stores nearby, so we get monthly subscribe-and-save deliveries of the following:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E05G">Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E074">Kashi GOLEAN Crunch!

I eat it for breakfast every morning and often for a snack as well - it really is tasty and filling, has lots of healthy protein and fiber, and doesn't leave you feeling sugar-shocked like kid's cereals overloaded with high fructose corn syrup and cane sugar.  I rotate between the five cereals listed above to keep things interesting.

review/text: This might be an excellent cereal, but the boxes that I bought had large pieces stuck together that were hard as a rock and dangerous to the fillings in your teeth.  They can be manually broken apart, but that is a lot of extra trouble.  Other than that, the flavor is good.  It does have a significant amount of fiber, and a reasonable amount of protein.  There is a potential problem with sodium deficiency if you eat too many foods low in sodium (that can cause muscle cramps, especially in your legs).

review/summary: Yummy and super cruncholicious--but needs less "sugar"
review/text: I find the crunch and texture of this is very satisfying when you want to get your teeth into a granola-like cereal. The flavor is a melange of grains and of sweetness. It's reminiscent of sugar smacks--but richer and more healthful. :)<br /><br />I do wish they'd dial down the sweetness. Kashi has some very nice granola medleys and cereal products, but on some cereals--like this one and the Cocoa Beach granola--its sooooooooooooooooo sweet. Too sweet. I'm assuming most of the consumers of Kashi cereals are grown-ups, not kids. Well, grown-ups just don't need cereal to have this much SUGAR...er...let's call it "evaporated cane juice". (same diff, really)<br /><br />I'll give it five stars the day they ease up on the sweet stuff.<br /><br />But I'll still buy it. I just dilute with a bit of unsweetened wheat puffs or more milk or Almond Breeze.

review/summary: Wonderful cereal if you can tolerate it
review/text: The nutritional profile of this cereal is excellent.  It's high in fiber, high in protein, yet has low fat and only moderate sugar.  The clusters are very crunchy if eaten straight, or shortly after put in milk.  In fact, they may be too hard for some people with sensitive teeth or gums.  They do soften after a couple minutes in milk, which is the best time to eat them in my opinion.  The taste is moderately sweet with mild, grainy undertones.<br /><br />For a such a healthy cereal, this is really one you could eat every day and not get tired of for a while.  One thing to note is that due to the chicory root extract in this cereal, some folks will experience very bad indigestion with this cereal.  I would advise trying a box from the store before buying a pack of 6 online.  If it plays nice with your stomach, then it's fantastic.

review/text: I'm a big cereal person. I can spend about ten minutes in the cereal aisle, comparing nutritional information, trying to choose between different flavors and brands (yeah, I'm super indecisive :/). However, I often come back to Kashi GoLean. Good old dependable, trusty Kashi. It tastes good and it keeps me full for much longer than any other cereal (I usually feel hungry again about an hour after eating, but Kashi can hold me off for a couple hours at least).<br />My only complaint about this cereal is its hard texture. I don't like having to bite and chew so hard to eat my breakfast, especially when it's early in the morning and I'm only half awake and incredibly grouchy. But the high fiber and protein make it a good breakfast otherwise.

review/summary: Went Lean
review/text: I bought a few cases of this cereal when I found it on sale. It is normally quite a bit more expensive in the grocery store. It arrived in good condition and I probably worked through 12 boxes in 2 months, which is a lot of cereal. I lost a bit of weight from it. I'm not sure if it makes you lean because it is healthy or because it is so crunchy that it takes twice as long to eat so you probably end up eating less. I like the taste and feel good for hours after I eat it. I'm not sure if this is exactly the same as what is sold in the stores. I felt like there were maybe more defects like the super-hard balls of honey, etc in the boxes I bought. This could just be paranoia on my part. Overall I love how it tastes and was very satisfied. I highly recommend this cereal if you are trying to lose weight.

Usually I add a half cup of fruit or half a banana to the cereal and one or two pieces of turkey bacon! With that I'm usually full for 4-5 hours!

review/text: The product came very quickly, and it was in fact 15oz sized boxes (I was worried since the stores seemed to carry 14.1oz boxes and I couldnt imagine there actually being two different sizes for such little difference, and ofcourse I was looking for a better deal than store prices).<br />The cereal itself is great, except I find it a touch too sweet compared to other Kashi brands, so I actually like to mix this cereal with the High Protein and High Fiber cereal half and half. But ofcourse everyone's going to have different preferences when it comes to taste, so I'm still giving 5 stars for the service and the quality of the cereal. Natural ingredients that taste good and are actually quite healthy.<br />If you're looking to beat store prices, you'll end up saving a couple bucks, but you'll save more if you purchase with the automatic renewal enabled, which can always be disabled anytime after or set to 6 months renewal. Not sure how fast one can really eat 6 boxes of cereal. It's taken me 3 or 4 months now I guess.

review/text: This  cereal is great to snack on while watching TV or a DVD.  My children even love it.  It is sweet enough that they eat it dry right out of the box.  Yet it is crunchy enough to keep things interesting.  Believe it or not they prefer this to a bowl of greasy popcorn.  Actually, I do too.  :)

review/text: Most cereal either tastes good or is bad for you.  GoLean Crunch has the best of both worlds - it tastes as great as most full-calorie granola cereals but it has lots of Fiber and Protein, which most people just don't get enough of in their diets.  I even keep a box of this stuff at work for snacking!

review/summary: And I don't even like cereal
review/text: I never have liked cereal-probably because I hate milk, but I wanted to eat healthier and kept seeing the ad for Kashi so I bought it. This is the very best snacky-breakfasty-anytime food I have ever had. I love the flavor, and because I do not drink milk, I eat mine in a bowl with a 1/4-1/2 cup of raisins-mmmmmmm...I swear its so good that you'll want to feel guilty for eating it!! Its is crunchy, but that's a good thing. Instead of reaching for the chips when I want to crunch, I reach for the Kashi. Love Love Love it!!!! I suggest you buy 2 boxes at first if you are married. My husband practically ate an entire box with in 2 days : )

review/summary: Bad For Your Health and Bad for Your Teeth
review/text: With a whopping 18 grams of sugar, this cereal ought to be banned for anyone with high blood sugar, hyperglycemia or diabetes.  Nobody concerned with being healthy ought to consume more than 4 grams of sugar in a meal.<br /><br />These sugary nuggets are so hard, if you have veneers or crowns, new or old, there is a good chance of them cracking and breaking off.  I've been to the dentist twice -- in order to get repairs done due to consuming this -- let's call it what it is -- breakfast CANDY!  My dentist entirely arned me off of consuming this garbage.<br /><br />"Oh, but it's so good for you!  Those whole grains!"  Hogwash.  It's got more sugar than protein.  There are much better foods for the (non-hypocritical) health-conscious person.

Between this and Honey Nut Cheerios, I don't have to feel guilty about giving my kids "bad" cereal.<br /><br />From a price perspective, you can't beat Amazon's Subscribe & Save. My family of six will work through these four boxes pretty quick. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: My Favortie Cereal...Next to Cinnamon Toast Crunch
review/text: I've been eating Kashi GoLean for about two years now and I can't live without it. It's just sweet enough to satisfy the kid in me and it's healthy enough to make me feel good about eating it. Though I do tend to eat really-sugary cereals like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Kashi GoLean is a great substitute. Come to think of it, I haven't eaten Cinnamon Toast Crunch in a while, probably because I've been eating GoLean just about everyday. The only downside is that the fiber can make you go the bathroom quite often. But if you balance your intake of cereal just right, you should be fine. In addition, the cereal tastes really good with Vanilla soy milk. I eat my GoLean with Silk Very Vanilla.

The clumps at the top of the box are quite large, and towards the end you're left with powdery stuff. Not a big minus, but I like my granola to be uniformish.

Instead of eating junk, I can eat something healthy, high in fiber, and filling. I don't get hungry for hours. Sometimes there are big clusters and other times a lot of crumbs, depending on settling, but it always tastes good. A slight cinnamon flavor with a satisfying crunch. It's hard to watch TV while eating due to all of the crunching. :-) It's definitely worth a try (I have never commented on a food before, so you know this has got to be good...)

review/summary: The health-conscious Honey Smacks
review/text: ...And that's a good thing, in my book. It has to be said that for cereals with this much nutritional content, it is an uncharacteristically sweet blend. But GoLean Crunch doesn't share the artificial, high-fructose corn-syrup taste of your favorite childhood cereal. The honey and cinnamon deliver a restrained but vibrant flavor that satisfies the sweet tooth and saves you the toothache. In time, you'll wonder why your body kept craving the kid's stuff at all.<br /><br />Kashi cereals are generally very satisfying--after downing a bowl, you feel a rush of energy and a lightness that many competing high-fiber cereals can't deliver. Along with a hot cup of coffee, fresh fruit and maybe some yogurt, this is a highly recommended breakfast item for anyone looking for sustained energy throughout the early hours of the day (and who isn't?).

Usually something that is so good for you does not taste so good. Well, in this case I don't mind eating the healthy cereal or buying my own blueberries to go with the cereal! It's that good. Very crunchy and just enough sugar to satisfy your taste. It really is the best cereal I've tried in a long while.

For some reason, the taste totally disappears once they come in contact with skim milk and they get soggy (and extremely chewy - like chewing coconut) in less than 3 seconds.  So it's like chewing on wet cardboard with a hint of cinnamon or something.  Maybe it's just me.  Oh well, go figure.  I do love them as a great finger food.  So I recommend these as a light, healthy snack right out of the box, but if you're looking to buy this as a breakfast cereal, I recommend looking elsewhere.

review/summary: Wow!  The crunchiest!
review/text: Billed as good tasting cereal that is also nutritious, the Kashi Golean Crunch  definately delivers the crunch.  Comparing the side nutrition info panel with other cereals shows low fat, low sugar, good fiber and a fair ammount of vitamins.  As with any granola based cereal, adding rasins, bananas, berries, etc. helped vary the taste immensely.  Even so, after 6 boxes I was ready for an extended break.  I expect I will enjoy it again later.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Great Cereal - Snack
review/text: This is an awesome cereal.  It makes a really good snack too.  That's what I mostly eat it for.  I personally think it has a natural brown sugar taste.  If you are looking for a healthy snack or a healthy cerealm this should be among your top choices.
