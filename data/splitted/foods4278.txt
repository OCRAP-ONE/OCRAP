review/summary: Warning!  Addicting!  :)
review/text: I have three cats who are addicted to these treats, and think I do not love them if I run-out.  I have tried other treats, I have even made treats from scratch....but they snub their noses at them and give me disappointed  faces and grumbles.  It likely is not the best thing for them, but I like that these treats are crunchy and lower-calorie then others I have compared to.  These treats run $3.50-$4:00 a bag in stores, so I was glad to discover that they can be purchased in a case from amazon with lower cost per unit.  Bulk-ordering also means I am less-likely to run-out........ and get furry guilt-trips parked in front of my computer monitor while I try to work.

review/summary: Cats are ADDICTED
review/text: When I first got my two cats, now ages 2 and 3, I was being a "responsible pet owner" and only feeding them all-natural treats. After about a month, they started turning their nose up at the treats. I thought it might be because they were a little stale. I bought a new pack of the all-natural treats and my cats still only ate them once before becoming disinterested at the prospect of "treat time". At $5 a bag, the "healthy" treats weren't worth the price with my cats refusing to eat them. So, I bought two bags of Whisker Lickin's treats, one crunchy, one soft. They are the cheapest treats on the market, so it wasn't a huge dent in my wallet if my cats didn't like them. My cats refused to eat the soft treats, but inhaled the Crunch Lovers Tuna treats. Now, one shake of the canister and they come running. They are constantly begging for treats and I've been able to teach them a few tricks because they'll do anything just to have another morsel.<br /><br />I highly reccommend these treats! I mentioned them to one of my friends who claimed her cat was super picky about treats and refused to eat any she bought. Now he also comes running when he hears the treats rattling in the canister. They might not be "healthy", but they're treats. Are they really supposed to be?

review/summary: Kitty Crack Indeed
review/text: I'm almost a little worried about how much my cat loves these treats.  He can't open the container, but daily he leads me to the pantry and places his paw directly on the container while staring at me wistfully and mewing softly (but insistently).  He just can't get enough of them and when he's done eating them from my hand he'll lick it clean.  Whatever Purina put in these, they did it right.  We used to get him greenies, which he relished, but he just loves these so much much I can't imagine switching back.  If you want a happy cat, you want these in your home, no way around it.

review/summary: Need a Tuna Treat Twelve-Step Program
review/text: My cats have eaten and preferred this treat to the exclusion of all other dry treats for many years.  This comment encompasses several cats of differing breeds and applies only to the Tuna flavor.  They have been addicted to them, and have manipulated me into keep them coming. I am a Tuna Treat codependent!  Recently, my grocery store stopped stocking this flavor, and I panicked.  Later, I was relieved to find that I could get it delivered in bulk regularly from Amazon.  Problem solved, and enabling facilitated.<br /><br />If you are game, try these treats on your cats.  I bet they'll like them -- REALLY like them.  Besides, they help with dental tartar.

review/summary: My 2 cats love these treats the best.
review/text: I've tried lots of different types of cat treats, but so far they love these the best. They are also hard, crunchy treats, so supposedly they also help with tarter control, though I'm not convinced they actually do. Also, the ingredients aren't exactly the healthiest, so these should be used as treats between healthy meals, not as primary food. Still, my cats absolutely love these treats, and a few here and there won't hurt them.

review/text: I suppose what makes a cat a cat is that it is finicky. That said, my cat loves these treats. I have read reviews where an owner states their cat hates them. I would suggest that you buy one can at a local store first before you buy a case and see your own pet's reaction. The " Subscribe and Save" option makes this even more of a deal as just when I am running out, another shipment arrives. My cat greets me at the door and expects a couple of these every day!

review/summary: Overall good cup!
review/text: Our household needs to limit caffeine, so we tried a couple of Jeremiah's decaf coffees.  We liked this one better--probably just individual tastes prefering the Columbian roast.  We wanted something higher quality than common grocery types, yet more cost effective for "everyday" than some mail order competition we really like--while retaining good flavor in a decaf.  So many decafs seem to need a lot more grounds to produce the same amount of flavor; this was not the case with this coffee.  It makes a good cup on its own, and is fine to blend with our standard Columbian to make a half-caf.  We will likely buy it again.

review/summary: Very pure coffee flavor
review/text: I recently switched to decaf and purchased Jeremiah's based on the reviews.  I wasn't disappointment.  The aroma of this coffee is just amazing and the flavor is bold & smooth.  You don't realize you're drinking decaf.<br /><br />I'm not a coffee connoisseur but I'm particular to odd chemical aftertastes that I've noticed with so many others brands.  You don't get that with Jeremiah's.  Just a real pure coffee flavor.  Jeremiah's description advertises "tangy & good acidity".  Not sure what that means as I didn't notice tangy or any acidity (probably for the better).<br /><br />The coffee packs are sealed in a way that you use scissors to cut it open rather than prying it apart.  Nothing ground breaking but to me it shows that the company pays attention to the finer details in assuring freshness and quality.

review/summary: Light and flavorful; helps me drink more water
review/text: I need to drink more water during the day.  The Vitamin Squeeze gives regular water a nice light flavor of fruit punch, helping me accomplish the goal of being well hydrated.  The vitamins are a nice added benefit.  One small downside is that the Vitamin Squeeze does need to be refrigerated after opening.  Otherwise, it's a great product.

review/summary: Wasn't bad
review/text: I am a really big fan of these squeeze drinks for water and I have to say that this one isn't that bad at all. The taste is a very mild fruit punch unless you squeeze a lot into your glass, and overall the flavor really isn't that bad. Sweet, yet mellow but it definitely isn't your normal fruit punch flavor. For it does remind me of a more childlike or even a more watered down and less sugar added HiC pouches I use to drink in middle school. Yet for people you want something different then the normal water this adds something plus I do enjoy the fact that it does hold a little bit of a vitamin energy to help get you through the day. I was squeezing this into my water bottle and taking it on the go when I go out to work out and had found that it helps keep me hydrated and even a little energized.<br /><br />I have to recommend these type of drinks for people who are tired of just regular water, would like to get some extra vitamin's when a water adder but I do wish the taste could be more improved and that there are clear directions on exactly how much a squeeze is really needed. I usually do it to taste but this packaging does make it hard to understand.

review/summary: Great vitamin/mineral additive
review/text: I'm not a water drinker and have to force myself to drink it. I constantly look for ways to supplement plain water to make it more palatable so decided to try this product.<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy additive, this does give you vitamins and minerals that water lacks. However, that said there are a lot of additives and as you can see by the ingredient listings 'water' is the first ingredient:<br /><br />Water, citric acid, vitamin C, natural flavor, sucralose, natural caffeine, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, magnesium lactate, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, calcium lactate, potassium phosphate, vitamin A, palmitate, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12<br /><br />The directions say to do a one squeeze into 8 ounces of water. I didn't really care for it in plain water. Seemed a bit metallic to me, not overwhelming, but nothing to make me want to gulp water all day! I drink a lot of tea, sparkling soda and Crystal Light type products so I ended up using it in pitchers of Crystal Light and sparkling water. It was very good used that way and of course you feel good thinking you are getting vitamins with your Aspartame based drinks. I tried the fruit punch supplement in raspberry tea, but lets just say--not so good.<br /><br />Finally, I can't say I noticed any extra energy descending upon me, but I like the fact that this provides some vitamin intake I might not otherwise get during my liquid imbibing.

review/summary: How much is a "squeeze"?
review/text: This vitamin/caffeine additive to plain water is not overly delicious.  It has a rather strong cough syrup flavor, even at a "small squeeze" portion, and it is VERY RED.  There is not a single direction about how big a squeeze should be, though I suppose at 24 portions, one could divide and assume it is .5 oz.  I was hoping for a bit of a morning "pick up," but the caffeine level is not enough for any sort of boost.  I'd rather take my vitamins as a pill and can't recommend this water-flavorer.

review/summary: So-so water additive
review/text: I'm all for products that increase my water intake throughout the day.  While I enjoy plain water, an extra added flavor boost is welcome at times. I found Vitamin Squeeze to be just OK in my opinion.<br />Pros:  Easy to use and not very messy. Flip the cap, squeeze into water, shake and you're done.  It has a good quantity of vitamin C and B vitamins, which help boost my energy level, 40 mg of caffeine and some electrolyte replenishment with added potassium.  It's a good product for use after a workout.<br />Cons:  You should refrigerate it after opening according to the package.  That makes it hard to store in the car or gym bag.  I'm also not a fan of the sucralose, and wish they had just used a little natural sweetener.  The sucralose gives me a headache, and I could do without that in a product.  I'm also not always looking for caffeine after a workout, and wish they'd left this out as well.  With the B vitamins and electrolytes, I think it was unnecessary.  Flavor is fair.  You can increase or decrease the strength of the flavor with how much you put into your water.  One squeeze is just faintly sweet and fruity to me.  This brings up my other beef - I wish the directions and serving size were not 'one squeeze'.  If I'm feeling feisty, a squeeze can be two tablespoons.  You can also squeeze out half a teaspoon if you're gentle with it.  I wish this was more standardized, especially with 40 mg caffeine in a serving.  If you look at the fine print, a serving is 15 ml.  Not everyone is going to know this is three teaspoons.  They could have put three teaspoons right out there so it was clear.<br />Will I get this again after I run out?  Probably not.

review/summary: Good flavor and Not too sweet
review/text: I drink a lot of bottled water, all day, everyday and the fruit punch flavor was a pleasant change to my usual plain water.  I do like that it has added vitamins, but it still doesn't make this a healthier product.  I'd prefer the coloring be removed and no artificial sweeteners added, and instead use natural or no color with fruit juice &lt; would be a nice change >.<br />If you are just looking for an occasional flavor boost and don't mind the dye, you might enjoy this.  The bottle was easy to use, once I cut the inner seal off.  The boost of vitamins didn't have much impact for me, but the flavor is good.

review/summary: Like a faster & easier Crystal Light, with caffeine & vitamins.
review/text: These days, it seems like there's a caffeinated version of everything. Caffeine gum. Caffeine water. Caffeine workout pills and powders. Caffeine shots (5-hour energy). Super-caffeinated 'energy' soda. I guess it makes sense that now they're making a caffeinated version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007AXVG8K">Mio Energy Liquid Water Enhancer, 3 - Count</a>.<br /><br />As a 'water enhancer', this stuff is decent. It's not much different from the generic fruit flavor of other low/no-calorie 'water enhancers' like Crystal Light or Mio. It's got some good points, like 120% vitamin C and 40% of multiple B-vitamins, as well as some zinc and chromium. It's got a moderate caffeine zip (40mg per serving... one squeeze = one serving, two squeezes will nicely flavor a bottle of water), but it's not excessive as some energy sodas or workout powders can be.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that artificial sweeteners and caffeine are becoming WAY too common in American food/beverages (I normally try to avoid these kinds of things, but am reviewing this for the Vine program), there's only one downside to this product -- the container leaks slightly. I know it's not just my particular sample, because my coworker saw it and warned me before I'd even taken off the safety seal. I guess there's just something quirky about the design.<br /><br />All in all, this stuff tastes decent, packs a nice little B&C Vitamins punch and will give you a nice zip thanks to its caffeine content.

review/summary: Good flavor, not sure about benefits
review/text: The fruit punch flavor is very artificual, but I kinda liked it. It was sweet and fruity. It reminds me of Hawaiian Punch a lot. The flavor stayed with me for a long time and I didn't mind because it was good.<br /><br />I can't comment as to whether or not it gave me more energy. I didn't feel "energized" but at the same time, I was able to stay awake and alert after a bad night of storms and not sleeping.<br /><br />What I like about it isn't the energy aspect of it, but the vitamins. One serving (1/2oz) provides 120% vitamin c, 40% of b6, b5, b3, and b12, and all with no sugar or calories. Fir someone with a limited diet due to family allergies, this is really useful.<br /><br />I would like to see if there are other flavors that aren't so full of red food coloring.<br /><br />I drank some after running and found that my energy didn't drop off and I stayed feeling good so I think I'm sold in it!

review/summary: Taste is there but it stains, bad!!!
review/text: During the day I wake up and drink cold coffee and sometimes use my Tassimo maker. The rest of the day I drink a lot of water. I usually drink bottled water and do not mind the `plain' taste.<br /><br />Sadly I can not read the ingredients on my bottle since it is covered with a sticker but the vitamin part seemed interesting. I have tried to add flavors to my water before but they have tasted artificial. I will say this does taste like fruit punch as it is listed. I was surprised at how flavorful it was and that it did not taste artificial like the other drinks I have tried. I found it rather refreshing and loved the flavor of it.<br /><br />The reason I would not buy it though is it is messy. I accidentally squeezed some out of the cup and it was so sticky. That was not the worse. I have cream colored counters and it leaked on them and it was less than 10 seconds of it sitting on the counter and figured a wet paper towel would wipe it up. Nope, it was already stained! I was shocked! I had to use one of those magic eraser pads to clean it off the counter. For how sticky and how easily it stains, it is not worth it to me.<br /><br />Taste wise it is there. However, if it stained that quickly, I wonder what it does to your body. I don't think I will be finishing it.<br /><br />Added after writing review: If I could give this a zero I would! I had the bottle near the computer to write the review. It has to be in the fridge after you open it. It was in the fridge with the cap down. I flipped it where the cap was on top thinking it would not leak this way taking it back to the fridge. Nope, the cap held the previous leftover squeeze and it leaked ALL over my cream rug and also my computer stand which is padded. I got rid of it. It is too messy and stains!

review/summary: Tastes like weak Hawaiian Punch with ingredients I don't want
review/text: I try to consume natural products as much as is conveniently possible. I also try to avoid food products with added chemicals as much as is conveniently possible. I exercise a lot and need to stay hydrated and be sure I get necessary electrolytes. I thought I'd try this Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink.<br /><br />You dispense this by a "squeeze." How much is a squeeze? Good question. The label says a serving size is 1/2 fl oz. I have no idea how much that is when delivered as a squeeze but I guess I can get a shot glass and figure it out. A bottle of this has 24 servings and apparently it is up to you to decide how much water you need for a serving. My experience with it is that 16 ounces of water is way too much for one squeeze of this stuff... it results in a very weak tasting drink. So you can then squeeze more but then you'd be getting more of the vitamins and other stuff...<br /><br />I take a daily multi-vitamin, Vitamin D and B-complex vitamin. I don't really need vitamins in my water and I sure don't need sucralose and this has both. So for those reasons I would not purchase this product in the future.<br /><br />As for the taste, it reminded me of a weak Hawaiian Punch. It wasn't what I would characterize as a natural tasting fruit flavor even though the label mentions "natural flavor" but it doesn't exactly specify what that is. This also has 40mg of caffeine.<br /><br />To me, this is just a weird product. Just because you can add vitamins, caffeine and some assorted "electrolytes" doesn't mean you need to. I get energy drinks, I just don't get this one.

review/summary: Like the pick-me-up
review/text: Gotta say, having an instant energy boost I can just squeeze into a glass of water or my water bottle for a day at the office is really quite handy.  I feel about as energized as a glass of juice or a milder energy drink would leave me--so don't really expect this to fulfill high energy expectations.  This fills the niche of a nice, nutritious water enhancer with a bit of a pick-me-up.  No jitters here.  I like the flavor, though the recommended squeeze-to-water ratio leaves the taste a bit on the light side.  Which also begs the questions, just how much is a squeeze?  In many ways this is rather gimmicky, but if it's your thing, it certainly does all that it announces.

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: I really do not want to review this because I sort of like the taste, at least at first, then there is the after taste.  I do not like to have an aftertaste when I eat or drink anything.<br />The flavor, at first, was very refreshing as long and you keep drinking it.<br />If you are one that is used to diet flavors then you will probably love this. It is a typical diet water, but they say it is natural.  I am not sure but is caffeine natural and sucralose?<br />I would rather just have plain old white sugar at least I know what to expect and it tastes a lot better than this.<br /><br />With all that said the packaging is fine, I like the squirting cap it is like the new ketchup bottles that stand upside down.  So if they could just take away the after taste on this flavored water I would give it a 4 star but for now it only deserves 3.  I am being generous.

review/summary: Really Enjoy This Water Enhancer
review/text: I've tried the Mio and now the Vitamin Squeeze water enhancers.  I didn't like the taste of the Mio, but love the taste of this one, which is Fruit Punch (a flavor I normally avoid because it is so sweet).  I didn't really feel an energy rush with this drink, but I did feel pretty good, which I would assume would be the vitamins!<br /><br />One great thing about this water enhancer: no aspertame!  I'm actually allergic to aspertame, and have a really hard time finding water flavorings that don't contain it.<br /><br />Here is the list of ingredients:  Water, citric acid, vitamin C, natural flavor, sucralose, natural caffeine, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, magnesium lactate, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, calcium lactate, potassium phosphate, vitamin A, palmitate, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12<br /><br />One bottle is supposed to flavor about 24 8oz glasses of water.  I actually like mine a bit lighter on the Fruit Punch flavor, so I think it is going to last longer.<br /><br />The only down-side to this water enhancer is that the bottle is pretty big, so there really is no sneaking this one into my purse to flavor water on-the-go.<br /><br />In all, this one is a keeper and I WILL be getting more!  I can't wait to try the Acai, Grape Pomegranate!

I can live with a drink that has a small amount of natural sugar, that's what I usually do if I want to cut down on sugar, just use less instead of using the far worse artificial sweetener.<br /><br />But what this drink fails most from is the flavor. It reminds me and my kids of cherry flavored cough syrup, not a flavor that people want to be reminded of. The other flavors might be ok, if I want multivitamins, I'd probably take a multivitamin pill and just drink water.

review/summary: Caffeine and Vitamin C Served Up In A Drink Reminiscent Of Watered Down Sugar Free Kool-Aid
review/text: I picked up the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink to take to work and give a boost to my water consumption. Who couldn't use a bit more vitamin C or energy? While there is some nutritional value in the vitamin content, the drink is also loaded with artificial ingredients. The caffeine content, alone, seems counterintuitive to something that wants to market itself as healthful. So, I'm not sure that Vitamin Squeeze has exactly figured out which niche in the marketplace it wants to fulfill. Health or energy? By making claims to both, it also falls short of either.<br /><br />The one thing I did like is that the bottle is much bigger than other water additives (heck, the waste of plastic and processing on those tiny bottles drives me insane). The instructions say that you add a squeeze to 8 ounces of water. That would make 24 servings in the bottle supposedly. One problem, a squeeze isn't a real unit of measurement. With too little, there is no taste at all and if you use enough to notice--you'll probably only end up with 8-10 servings. The taste, even with extra squeezing, is like diluted sugar free kool-aid. It's not awful, but it has a pronounced aftertaste. If you're looking for a caffeine supplement, you might find this appealing enough. But it's not something that I would revisit for either the vitamins or the caffeine. KGHarris, 6/12.

review/summary: Good idea, but not quite there yet
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch. Sounds like a good idea, to add more vitamins to your daily water intake, right?<br />As far as vitamins, what you are getting is a good dose of B vitamins, which is nice. My main issue is that, along, with the vitamins, you get caffeine, sucralose (artificial sweetener), sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate (preservatives) and Red #40, which oddly isn't listed on the Amazon description.<br />And, what the heck is "natural flavor" when no juice is listed? That is kinda scary!<br /><br />The design of the bottle is nice. I like the shape which encourages a firm grip. ! It certainly is sealed well, with both an outer ring of packaging and an under cap seal.<br /><br />The taste of this particular flavor, Fruit Punch, is exactly what I would expect from Kool Aid of the same flavor. That nasty "red" aftertaste, thanks to the #40 food coloring. I would be careful using this product because I am pretty sure that it is going to stain just as bad as other red colored drinks.<br /><br />Do the benefits of vitamins offset the negative effects of the additives? Personally, I don't think so. I will not be buying this product.

review/summary: An "ok" energy drink
review/text: This product, the "Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch", offers a calorie free way to turn your water into a fruit-punch tasting energy drink.  One squeeze of the bottle will flavor 8 ounces of water.  Below are my impressions of this product:<br /><br />- It's hard to tell how much "one squeeze" is.  For my first glass, I gave the bottle a large squeeze, and discovered that I had put way too much flavoring in.  There are markings on the side of the bottle that show how much liquid would equate to one squeeze, but it's not transparent and you can't see the fluid level inside the bottle.  Through trial and error, I managed to work out how much of a squeeze flavored my water to the level I wanted it, though.<br />- It indeed tastes like fruit punch, but there is an aftertaste.  Given that it's artificially sweetened and fortified with vitamins, I expected that there would be.  It's about the same level of aftertaste as you might get from a glass of artificially sweetened kool-aid.  Not overpowering, but noticeable.<br />- I like that it's fortified with vitamins; while this might not be the best way to get them (eating nutritious foods is), every little bit helps!<br />- If you like energy drinks, this is an efficient way to store them.  One 12 ounce bottle effectively replaces 24 8 ounce cans.  All you need to do is add a "squeeze" to a glass or bottle of water.<br /><br />Overall, "Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink" gives you a shot of caffeine and some important vitamins per serving and is concentrated so that it won't take up a lot of room in your fridge.  But the taste to me is just ok.  And that's how I rate this drink: "ok", which in my scoring system is three stars.

review/summary: Quick boost with added benefit
review/text: I carry a 40 ounce <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019N2DO8">Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel Water Bottle</a> or a 1.5 liter Sigg Water Bottle just about everywhere I go.  In the afternoons, when my brain stops functioning and I get groggy, I tend to have a caffeine boost of some kind, which has meant making tea or coffee.  When it gets hot, those just don't work for me, and I don't like iced tea. I don't want to spend more money on single serving sized energy boosts.<br /><br />So, I've been interested in trying some of the new (to me at least) squirt options to add to my water bottle.<br /><br />I'm quite pleased.  The taste is good and there certainly is an energy boost.  The added vitamins also help me be at my optimum performance in the afternoons.<br /><br />A couple of minor quibbles which keep this from being ideal. It does need to be refrigerated after opening it the first time, which keeps it from traveling with me.  Also, and this is going to sound a bit silly, I'm not sure how much squeeze a "squeeze" takes. I give a couple of squeezes in my water bottles, which seems to work fine, but I'm just not sure what is too much or what is too little. I guess it's a matter of taste--which makes sense.

review/summary: Just a squirt adds lots of great flavor!
review/text: We have tried several other flavors, and brands of water flavoring that you just squirt in the bottle or glass.<br />This is the first time we have tried the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink.<br />I have to say the flavor is very refreshing and tastes very good.<br />Although, I did not notice much extra "energy".<br />At the same time it did not leave me feeling gittery or anxious.

review/summary: Not usually fond of this type of product
review/text: So I've tried this type of product before - I believe it was put out by Kraft (mio liquid) - but it ended up making my otherwise fresh, delicious, and pure water taste like a semi-polluted river from an industrial accident.  With less than high hopes for this Vitamin Squeeze, I poured myself some water, dumped some of this stuff in, drank it...and DIDN'T feel the need to spew it back out!<br /><br />In fact, it tasted quite a bit like Gatorade or Vitamin Water.  Somewhat pleasant, but not all the way...In fact, I'll probably use the rest of the bottle before making my final decision to keep buying/using it or not.  (Unlike the Kraft stuff that went straight to the trash.)<br /><br />The two main factors I don't like this are:<br />1.  Red #40.  Why can't a company spend a few extra cents and use something natural.  I don't want my kids drinking this (though I'm a little more lenient for myself.)  Swap that artificial flavors with Beet Juice...get the same redness without the additives.<br /><br />2.  The sweetener.  It's the sucralose or whatever stuff that leaves the weird aftertaste.  While certainly better than High Fructose Corn Syrup as far as what I want in my body, it's the aftertaste that is the biggest disappointment of the flavor of this stuff.  What's wrong with going "old fashioned" and using "sugar?"  Surely, somebody still grows sugar somewhere in the world...<br /><br />If you're in the market for something like this, I'd recommend trying a single bottle before investing in a 4-pack case.  It's better than the competition, for sure...but might not be quite what you're hoping for.

review/summary: Tastes good, not great
review/text: It is what it is: liquid drink concentrate in a handy squeeze bottle, which turns plain water into sort of a diet Kool-Aid (or Hi-C) with a bit of a caffeine jolt. One difference I saw between this and Mio drink concentrate (which I also tested through Vine) is that the Vitamin Squeeze label says to refrigerate after opening, while the Mio label says it doesn't require refrigeration. So I dunno what will happen to Vitamin Squeeze if, say, it's left in your gym bag in a hot car all day.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze is sweetened with sucralose aka Splenda, which doesn't give me and my family violent stomach cramps like sorbitol, so that's a plus.  The taste is like diet fruit punch, not as good as Crystal Light, but acceptable. My older daughter likes the taste also; younger one didn't.

review/summary: Sweet
review/text: Pro:<br />-----<br />Easy, and quickly (surprisingly!) dissolves in water without effort, and has that familiar sweet fruit punch flavor you know and love.<br /><br />Con<br />-----<br />If you're not looking for a sugary (or fake sugary) fruit punch mix, this isn't for you.<br /><br />I am fully of the opinion that this is just another no-sugar sugar drink parading as a health product.<br /><br />What you get is a red syrup that easily dissolves in water and tastes like that generic Hi-C/Kool-Aid/Hawaiian Punch Fruit punch. You know, the red sweet stuff.<br /><br />But I like it. I don't use very much because I like the less sweet version of that same artificial fruit punch flavor (I actually do like it. If you don't, steer clear). It's definitely not "too sweet" if you realize what you're in for. It is definitely NOT flavored water. It is fruit punch mix. But it's much, much easier than powder, and if you keep it on the shelf in your fridge, it will take up a lot less room than the equivalent bottles. You could easily use this in cocktails too.

review/text: This stuff tastes okay to me, but with a hint of aftertaste.  However, I obtained it for my daughter who needs some vitamin help right now due to a medical thing.  She likes the flavor, but the problem is I did not note that it has caffeine in it.  So I won't get more of it as she really does not need caffeine at all.  But other than that, I don't see a problem.

review/summary: OK Sugar Free Drink
review/text: I am not a big fan of artificially flavored drinks, and this vitamin squeeze energy drink is no exception. I really don't like the aftertaste of such drinks. However, putting that aside, this is a fairly refreshing and nice-tasting drink as far as it goes. The flavor is a bit reminiscent of a cough syrup. The packaging and mixing are very convenient - I was surprised that you really didn't need any stirring or shaking for this solution to completely dissolve in water. This drink is a convenient option if you spend a lot of time in a place that has plenty of water fountains or water coolers, and very limited refrigerator space. Aside from the interesting packaging and the delivery method there is nothing all that special about this drink that would distinguish it form others in the same category.

review/summary: a big bottle to jazz up your water....
review/text: I use the mio beverage enhancers pretty regularly and was interested in trying the vitamin squeeze to see how it would compare.  Here are my pros/cons:<br /><br />Pros-not overly sweet, a nice big bottle (12 oz, next to under 2 oz. for the Mio), lots of vitamins and zero calories.  Makes getting in your water much easier.<br /><br />Cons-bottle needs to be refrigerated after opening (unlike the Mio).  This makes it not as portable for me.  No leaving it in a backpack or a desk drawer, that is the major drawback for me.  Though I liked this flavor, it tasted more citrusy than it tasted like fruit punch-not a big deal, but if you are expecting fruit punch flavor you won't get it here.<br /><br />Overall, I would consider purchasing for home use, but not portable enough due to needing refrigeration for it to be my "go to" brand for when I am away from home.

review/summary: Better than many water flavorings with benefits
review/text: First of all, I prefer plain water, but when I need a refreshing drink, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQMC">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> fits the bill.  Better than MIO, in my opinion, I find that this gives me a very little boost when added to my water bottle for consumption while I work in my garden.  When I first tasted the drink prior to adding it to water, it reminded me of the liquid vitamins I gave to my daughter many years ago and I expected to not like it at all.  In the diluted state, it is rather refreshing and I expect to be able to consume a bottle within the thirty days it apparently will last after opening.  The bottle needs to be refrigerated after opening and I'd recommend not storing them in a heated environment.  Although caffeine is listed near the top of ingredients, I did not feel the effects when mixed as directed.  I imagine that for those who are drinking this for the jolt, you'd find it necessary to make a more concentrated solution and then you'd have the vitamins in excess.  Although I give this product 4 stars because it's better than average in taste compared to similar prouducts, I probably will not purchase it in the future because I prefer to have my vitamins separate from my caffeine.

review/summary: Water Booster with Artificial Sweetener
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze is a fun way to add flavor and vitamins to water.  For the price, it goes a pretty long way, and flavor can be adjusted to taste.  It is great that there is nutritional value rather than just coloring and flavor like some competitors.  The flavor is good, but not amazing.  My main warning is that although it says "all natural," it does contain sucralose (Splenda) sweetener.  I don't mind a little here and there, but I have found that it interferes with my diet if I overdo it.  So, I would not use this in all of my water, but would use it for a treat here and there.  If you would like something natural to flavor water, SweetLeaf makes flavored liquid stevia.<br /><br />Overall, a decent way to get some vitamins if you do not mind artificial sweetener.

review/summary: I'm underwhelmed
review/text: I'm not so sure about Vitamin Squeeze. It works a lot like Mio, just squeeze a bit into a glass or bottle of water and drink. We do need to refrigerate it after opening, which makes it less portable, and the bottle is pretty big. Mio is at least small and can be carried in a purse.<br /><br />The "energy" comes from a variety of vitamins and minerals and caffeine. The labeling says it's not for children, but I let my children try it. Let's just say they didn't care for it. Personally, I like the taste of Mio better. Vitamin Squeeze is a little too sweet without much flavor. I was underwhelmed.

review/summary: Good Tasting, Good Energy - Recommended
review/text: This Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is good tasting and definitely provides an energy kick. I like this type of additive and regularly use Mio, so expected to like the flavor and was also prepared the slight aftertaste from the artificial sweetener.<br /><br />The recommended serving size is "one squirt" per 8oz of water and I find that does make it sweet enough. The flavor is sort of generically "fruity" and is nicely refreshing. It is important to shake the container well before dispensing to ensure everything is well mixed.<br /><br />This does have a good energy lift from caffeine and Vitamin B, and also has significant Vitamin C content (120% per serving). Since this is a good sized bottle at 12oz (24 servings), it is more convenient to keep on hand in the kitchen than the smaller Mio bottles (which are nice to carry on trips).<br /><br />A good choice for home use, mostly due to the large size.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Not My Main Squeeze
review/text: This water enhancer promises to infuse your water with a good tasting vitamin energy supplement.  I liked the design of the bottle.  Shake well and one squeeze will be enough for 8 ounces of water.  Fat free, carb free and calorie free, it certainly is a dieter's dream.  The fruit punch flavor was okay, a little bit fake, like maraschino cherry juice.  Not unpleasant but Hawaiian Punch has nothing to worry about.  The chemical aftertaste was not pleasant. I noticed no improvement in my energy level, but again, I am a fairly heavy coffee drinker so perhaps I've become caffeine resistant. This product must be refrigerated after opening and used within thirty days.<br /><br />I would use this only as a back up to MIO.  I found the MIO flavors more appealing and it doesn't have to be refrigerated.  The MIO container is more portable.

review/summary: Convenient - Good Idea - Adequate Quality/Taste
review/text: We were pretty excited to try this out especially for use with workouts etc..water doesn't always cut it and Gatorade etc gets a bit costly plus all the sugar and salt really adds up over time.<br /><br />First, the squeeze idea is great! No mess, no fuss, super simple to use. Vast improvement over powdered drinks (including gatorade)with the added benefit of being able to adjust for personal preference.<br /><br />I found a quick squeeze more than ample; my other half liked a bit more flavor. We both liked the ability to squeeze and go. So far so good. Will give the convenience a big PLUS!<br /><br />The so-so part is the flavor...I'm just not wild about the fruit punch flavor but would probably be willing to give other flavors a try and see if they are more to my liking. It's not bad per se, it's just not that good. At first I thought it was just me but spouse felt the same way. Will consider this more or less neutral since it's not great but certainly not bad either.<br /><br />Now for the thing that I don't really like...the vitamins. Yes, there is a nice range of vitamins and at first glance, that sounds fine BUT, the quality of the included vitamins is questionable. For example, for B12, cyanocobalmin is used rather than the more expensive (and bioavailable) methylcobalmin. To be perfectly fair, the vast majority of people probably won't/don't care and the idea of taking in some vitamins at all is an improvement. However, those that are health conscious and/or only use bioavailable forms of vitamins will be disappointed. I try not to take inferior vitamin types so that they don't block absorption of better/more available forms.<br /><br />All in all, a vast improvement over cola's. Very convenient. Not bad tasting but not great and selection of vitamins could be better.

review/summary: Okay But Not as Good as Mio
review/text: I've used different Mio flavors in the past to flavor water. After using this product I find I prefer them to this projduct.<br /><br />For one thing, the bottle is difficult to open. I finally had to get a knife to cut open the seal. Of course, the drink sprayed all over the place.<br /><br />It states that you need one squeeze for 8 ounces of water. The instructions for 'one squeeze' aren't very scientific, and it's a matter of trial and error to get the water flavored to your taste. The first time I tried it there was not enough flavor, so I had to squeeze it twice. It'd be nice if tiny drops came out instead of a stream.<br /><br />I'm usually a big fan of fruit punch flavors, but this one was kind of odd. Not terrible but not as flavorful as the Mio flavors I've tried in the past.<br /><br />The one advantage this product has over Mio is that it includes vitamins, though I doubt there's enough to make a real difference.<br /><br />All in all, this product is just okay.

review/text: It says "all natural", but the sweetener is artificial splenda (don't mind though).<br /><br />Fruit punch is not my fav taste but it's actually not bad. I used 2 squeezes for 24 oz bottle and got just a little taste to have a break from water. It was already sweet to me.<br /><br />I wish they would provide info about caffeine, how much in 1 tablespoon or anything so I would know how much I drink (being pregnant). But I can only assume is not much, especially in 2 squeezes..<br /><br />Overall nothing I got crazy about. Good idea but maybe I'd like different taste better.

review/text: With zero calories, zero sugar and zero carbs, this is a great drink if you are trying to watch your waist line. This squeeze flavoring is much minder than some of the other similar style drink options on the market. When using the recommended amount, you will get something more akin to fruit punch flavored water vs. actual fruit punch. I don't think this is a bad thing, as our taste buds are conditioned for overly sweet drinks.<br /><br />The one thing I would warn against is that one of the main ingredients in this drink is sucralose (Splenda). So, if you are against the myriad of artificial sweeteners on the market today, this drink is definitely not for you.

Mio is also very costly for the size of the bottle which is less than 2 oz. and has no real nutritional value. I have only tried the Fruit Punch flavor but it's pretty good. I am not jumping with joy over the taste but it's my favorite so far out of what I have tried. It taste reminds me of Tahitian Treat soda but with much less sweetener. I like that it comes in a large 12 oz. bottle because value is very important to me and the price fairly reasonable to me. It also has added Vitamin C, B6, B5, B12, B3, Zinc, Chromium and Magnesium. It also has an unknown amount of caffeine but it only seems to have a small dose per serving because it's hardly noticeable. Overall I like this product look forward to trying other flavors.

Maybe, those that do not regularly take a B-complex or drink the 2-3 cups of coffee that I do will feel more of a boost.

And depending on how much energy you want you can control that as well. And if you figure out how many drinks you can make with this bottle it's very cost-effective.

review/summary: Surprisingly Wonderful Drink Additive...as Long as You Like Sucralose
review/text: My expectations for this product were pretty low. To my surprise, I very much enjoyed Vitamin Squeeze. It provides a nice energy kick and some vitamins to your water. I liked the flavor just fine, but if you're sensitive to artificial sweeteners then it might now be for you. I like that I control the strength of the flavor, caffeine, taurine, etc. Depending on how I'm feeling, I can use a bit or a lot. As with all energy drinks, you need to careful with how much you consume; if you have too much then you'll have a big crash a few hours later.<br /><br />Bottom line: as long as you're not sensitive to sucralose then I recommend giving this drink additive a shot for a boost of energy and some vitamins.

review/summary: Love the large sized bottle
review/text: While I like the MIO additives, I am always hesitant about putting too much because of the small bottle it comes in. No hesitation here, with the larger bottle, I can get the flavor just as I want it without feeling I used too much. As to the flavor, it is a nice Fruit Punch, (still would prefer Grape or Lemonade). Zero Carbs, Calories & Sugar but with all the Vitamin C & B you need after a workout.<br /><br />If you prefer your water with some flavor, Vitamin Squeeze is your best bargain buy.

review/text: This is a very nice additive for your bottled water.  My kids had no problem adding it to their water whereas if I'd given them a B-vitamin to take they would have freaked out.  I've used the energy and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQJU">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Tropical Citrus, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and the kids have loved both flavors.  It's cheaper, tastes better and less waste than Propel or Vitawater.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: Prior to trying out this product, I have only flavored my water with the powered products.  This product had a very nice Fruit Punch flavor, but an after taste that kicks in shortly after finishing the beverage (20 oz bottle in less than a couple of minutes).  I only took off one star for this, as I can not rate the product on the health benefits from only using one bottle of it.  Also, like I said above, this is the first product of its kind that I have tried and I do not have anything similar to compare it to (ie: Mio).  Would I buy it?  No.  Would I drink/use it again?  Yes.

review/summary: Nice little water boost
review/text: If I were a real adult, I could just drink plain water and be happy. And, yes, most of the time I CAN just drink plain water and be happy, but sometimes a little boost of vitamins, energy and yes, delicious fruit flavor can satisfy the 10-year old in me, especially after a big workout, when I seem to crave a Gatorade something fierce. This stuff does it. Just a squirt turns your water into a tasty combination of Gatorade and vitamin water. And one bottle lasts a long time, too. Thumbs up.

review/summary: Do It Yourself Energy Mix
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Fruit Punch is a tasty and economical alternative to canned energy drinks. The punch flavor is good and can be adjusted to taste by using more or less of the product in your water, but increasing the flavor also means increasing the amount of caffeine in the drink. The vitamins and caffeine provide and nice boost without  causing the shakes or the crash that often follows. I look forward to trying other flavors.

review/summary: Good taste, not economical
review/text: This flavoring tastes good, but unlike others (like Mio) you need considerably more than one squeeze to bring the flavor up to a palatable level, so despite the larger bottle it is not very economical in the long run, especially for the price.  I gave it 4 stars instead of only 3 because unlike similar flavor additives, this one contains supplementary vitamins, which are a nice inclusion.

My wife calls it redbull water and i think its the right nickname.<br /><br />I'm not through my first squeeze bottle and it has made more than 20 bottles of water into redbull water.

review/summary: Taste and Energy are Meh
review/text: This was ok, nothing to write home about. The taste was like a watered down version of Crystal Lite and the energy was akin to drinking a cup of tea. Squeezing the stuff into a bottle was iffy since the serving was 1 squeeze, but I must have had a pretty good grip because the stuff kept coming out until about 1/5 of the bottle was gone. Even with that amount of product, the taste was meh. It had a fairly weak flavor and of course there was the usual aftertaste you get with most artificial sweeteners. I felt about as much of an energy boost as drinking a diet coke. I don't plan on adding it to my grocery list anytime soon.

review/text: FINALLY!  I Found A Product I Like!  Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink. I have tried MANY, MANY different water enhancers like Crystal Light (***), Mio (**), Lipton (**)but Vitamin Squeeze has 0 calories, sugar and carbs, 120% vitamin C, 40% of vitamins B3 B5 B6 B12, 10% zinc, 40 mg caffeine, 10 Taurine and electrolytes.<br /><br />I really don't care for artificial sweetners.  They leave a horrid aftertaste with me and I stay away from them.  Vitamin Squeeze is sweetened with sucralose.  I have reviewed other products with sucralose and have not cared for them at all.<br /><br />There is something different "in the mix" with Vitamin Squeeze that I prefer over the above mentioned products and I can tell you that I will be trying and buying the different varieties of Vitamin Squeeze!

review/text: This is a big bottle, not like the smaller versions of other similar type products I have tried.  I have found you need to be really careful when sqirting these things because if you happen to squirt it on an ice cube it shoots the stuff all over everywhere and you end up with a mess, so be careful.  I didn't particularly like the taste.  It was very candy tasting, sort of like pez.  I also didn't notice any sort of energy or vitamin boost, but I didn't drink a whole lot.  It's not terrible, but just not for me.

review/summary: Kind of like a bigger Mio, with more drinks per bottle
review/text: This product is quite like the Mio water enhancer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4ADKU">MIO Fruit Punch, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>), but with extra vitamins.  It tasted quite like liquid Jell-o to me.  Having tasted Mio before I do like this over a certain Mio flavor, but not than all flavors.  It is a decent sized bottle and overall tastes while only needing an average amount for the water: enhancer ratio.<br /><br />I buy a lot of these types of drinks, including the Propel packets, the Crystal Lights, the Mios, and the Lipton powders.  This larger size is more economical than the others, but the one minus is that you wouldn't want to carry this in a bag, while you can easily slip in a Propel or Lipton single-serve packet.  Therefore, for me, this is a complement to the other drink mixes I buy, not a full replacement.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this to Mio users because it has a lot more per bottle and does taste better if you raise the ratio, plus you get the extra vitamins, but keep in mind that this wouldn't be something you'd slip into a sportsbag (or for my wife, a purse).

review/summary: Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer Fruit Punch is a refreshing start to my day!
review/text: Tired of drinking the same bland, clear bottle of water every day at work or school?<br /><br />Looking for a source of Vitamin C and natural Caffeine with no calories or bitter coffee taste?<br /><br />If you answered yes to any of these questions, then Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer is a product you should try out soon.  Over the past few weeks, I have managed to empty an entire bottle of this product and wanted to share my experiences in this review.<br /><br />First, using Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer Fruit Punch flavor is very easy.  Just remove the top plastic, protective wrapping, unscrew the cap and take off the foil based seal.  Replace the cap and squirt 1/2 ounce into your cup of water.  The Water Enhancer seems to quickly dissolve in water and gives it a deep pink color.<br /><br />The Taste Of Enhanced Fruit Punch Water<br />Enhancing the flavor of pure water, is a simple thing to do.  Yet, Vitality Avitae Caffeinated Water has proven to me that you can mess it up real bad.  They made the mistake of adding no flavoring to mask the chemical taste of caffeine.<br /><br />With this product, we are told it has a fruit punch flavor and I heartily agree.  The fruit punch flavor hits your tongue and stays there.  In my opinion, it is mildly sweet but not overpowering in anyway.  You can increase the strength of the flavor by adding more Vitamin Squeeze but it can get to be rather strong.  Of course, you will also use up your little squeeze bottle faster as well.  Try not to apply this product in a cup with ice cubes because they will tend to keep it from dissolving into the rest of your water.<br /><br />Keep An Eye On The Serving Size!<br />My preferred water cup is a Tervis 24 ounce Big T Clear Tumbler with a McNeese State University logo inside.  The recommended serving size for Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch is half an ounce per 8 ounces of water.<br /><br />Maximize The Life Of Your Water Enhancer By Refrigerating It!<br />The energy and vitamin ingredients in this flavorful product should be preserved to maintain their peak effectiveness.<br /><br />In conclusion, after using Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch Flavor for four days, my energy levels have increased and my stamina has improved as well.  Could it be a side effect of drinking less sugar and more pure healthy water?  You be the judge!

review/summary: Love it but the price is holding me back from ordering more...
review/text: I am in love with Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink! Just a squeeze or two (or three, however much you want!) in a nice glass of water and you have yourself a super tasty energy drink with no carbs, no sugars, just energy and tastiness!<br />I also like the fact that you don't need a spoon to mix it, just the act of squeezing the product into the glass does a fantastic job at mixing it.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavor reminds me of Hawaiian Punch almost, which I love, but without the gobs of sugar. No weird or funky aftertaste or anything!<br /><br />However at about 25�+ per squeeze, I find it a bit too rich for my taste. Some Kool-Aid and zero calorie sweetener can make a similar tasting drink for MUCH less (and without the taurine and caffeine).<br /><br />If it was just a little bit cheaper, I'd be buying a truck load for the summer... but for now I'll just be sticking with plain ol' water.

review/summary: Good value, good flavor and a good boost - perfect for Soda Stream!
review/text: I like this better than powdered drink mix and it does not taste medicinal like a lot of vitamin drinks out there.  I use it to flavor my Soda Stream seltzer, tastes really good and gives enough boost to make me peppy but not manic.<br /><br />I use one squeeze and I find that is enough for me, but I like my seltzer mildly sweet so you may want two shots of this if you are looking for Hawaiian Punch sweet.<br /><br />Since you just have to squeeze it into water, I have used it as a mixer with other flavors.  I mixed it with fresh squeezed lemon juice to make a fruity lemonade, REALLY good and very refreshing and an extra vitamin C boost.  I added it to diet cola and it tasted kind of like a cherry coke. It is also good added to mixed cocktails: cosmo, rum punch, sangria, strawberry margarita, etc.<br /><br />I got a sample bottle for free to review, but I will definitely be buying this in the future!

review/text: I like that this product is vitamin enriched with Cs and Bs.  It does contain caffeine which has it's plus and cons.<br /><br />What I really like about this is that it does not leave a residue on water bottles or glasses like Crystal Light or other similar products.  The down side is that this product recommends refrigerating after opening.  - While understandable this is a major drawback in that I cannot just store it on my desk at work (where I typically use this type of product).  I also like that I can adjust the intensity of flavor readily which is messier to do with the little individual powder packets.  - I was skeptical about the fruit punch flavor but it is not all that different than other fruit flavored individual packets.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I didn't get any energy boost from adding this product to my water.  To me it's just another substitute for Crystal Light, Propel and all the other water additives on the market. Even with zero sugar I found the taste to be a bit sweet.  It was interesting to me to try a liquid additive vs. a powder but I still have to stir it in.  Add in the extra cost (which I think is high vs. competitive products) and the fact that this product needs to be refrigerated after opening (and has a recommended 30 day life) and I just don't see why I'd buy this product in the future.  There are too many other brands that taste better, cost less and don't need refrigeration.

review/summary: Not bad but not great
review/text: This is a great idea - water flavoring with no calories!  It helps you drink more water, and since almost no one drinks enough water, that's a good thing!<br /><br />But...<br /><br />There is nothing on the packaging saying you have to check the opening where the drink comes out.  Mine wasn't open, apparently (yes - I unscrewed the cap and took off the protective cover first) and nothing came out when I squeezed.  I squeezed harder, and red liquid came out from all over, including under the threading of the cap. Some got into my glass, luckily.<br /><br />After cleaning the counter, my shirt, and the bottle, I tasted my water.  Not bad.  Fruit punch is not my favorite flavor, but this was definitely tasty and didn't have a diet aftertaste.  I hadn't put enough in my cup, so very carefully (and in the sink) I squirted again.  It works fine now - yay!<br /><br />The fact that you're supposed to refrigerate after opening makes a certain other water enhancing drink (I hate those commercials, but their product is pretty good) much easier to take to work.  My purse isn't refrigerated, so I'll probably finish this up at home.  This product does have vitamin C and various vitamin Bs, so it's got that going for it, but since it's really not as user friendly as it should be, I think I'll get my vitamins somewhere else.

review/summary: when you need a little caffeine but don't want the sugar...
review/text: I drink A LOT of water. And sometimes, I want some taste to my water. That's where this product comes in.  It's got no calories, no sugar, no protein, no fat...  but it does give you something to actually taste. Unfortunately, it's not as great as I'd hoped.<br /><br />The bottle says all you need is one squeeze - well, to me, one squeeze is not enough - I could barely taste the flavoring. (This could be due to the fact that I'm a Southern gal, and our table wine is sweet - and I do mean *sweet* - tea.) Two squeezes seem to work best for me.<br /><br />The "no mess" claim is not entirely accurate either - for some reason, no matter how I hold the product, or cover my glass of water, some of it jumps out of the glass and onto the counter...necessitating a quick clean up.<br /><br />I'm also not crazy about some of the ingredients. Water is the first one (good); then a few down is sucralose, an artificial sweetener; then sodium benzoate, a food preservative and antifungal agent; and glyceryl abietate, an additive used as a stabilizer to keep oils in suspension in water (i.e. varnishes, paints, and cellulosic lacquers).  So... not exactly all vitamin, all healthy.<br /><br />Also, although I've had the product for a while now, I have to actually remember to use it. I don't automatically think "oh boy, time for my vitamin squeeze". Also, I'm pretty sure I'm long past the "use within 30 days" recommended on the package.<br /><br />On the upside, it does give me a nice boost of energy without a lag later.  It also has 120% vitamin C, 40% of the vitamin Bs, and 10% of zinc.<br /><br />I probably will not purchase.

review/text: Vitamin Squeeze is an energy drink concentrate water additive. I tried the fruit punch and found that one squeeze<br />made for a fairly weak flavor drink per 8oz of water, adding more didn't do much to enhance the product.<br />It also has the same aftertaste associated with artificial sweenters.<br />The addition of the vitamins and it being carb and calorie free is a plus but it has to be tasty and I didn't find it to be so.<br />The addition of the caffeine is (I'm assuming) where the energy boost comes from.<br />I wasn't a fan of Vitamin Squeeze and that's entirely due to its taste. The quantity is a positive and the product does require that it be refrigerated after its open (assuring it remains fresh on the downside it has to be used within 30 days) are two positives if you can get past the lackluster taste.

review/summary: Fruit Punch with No Sugar
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy drink is a concentrated fruit punch flavored water additive.  The taste is very similar to Kool Aid. The Vitamin Squeeze is a nice change of pace and can really spruce-up tap water.  Vitamin Squeeze is also very good at masking any chlorine-taste that tap water sometimes has.<br /><br />The only word of caution I have about this product is that a little bit goes a long way.  It is fairly difficult to control portion size.  The bottle claims that it contains 24 servings, but I found that a natural squeeze-serving gave me about 12-14 servings.  It is very easy to squeeze too hard.<br /><br />That said, there are zero sugars, zero calories and a host of vitamins and minerals (especially vitamin C).  With all the positive health benefits of vitamin C and none of the calories of juices, the Vitamin Squeeze is a good product.

There is an aftertaste that I'm sure is a result of the sucralose.  If I had known that this product contained sucralose I wouldn't have ordered it, but I couldn't find any ingredients listed on the product page.<br /><br />The packaging is convenient.  It would be easy to pack this in a bag and carry it with you to squirt into drinks throughout the day.  That is...if you can stand the taste.

review/summary: Surprised it needed refrigeration
review/text: This review is based on a sample bottle provided through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />I drink a lot of flavored water.  From Mio, to Nuun, to Crystal Light, and the store brands, I've tried most of them.  This one sounded pretty interesting.  Upon receiving the bottle, I stuck it in my bag to take to work.  When I went to use it for the first time, I looked at the back to see how much to use.  I was quite surprised to find it needed to be refrigerated after opening.  Back home it went, where it could be refrigerated.<br /><br />I find the flavor to be good.  You can actually taste the pineapple, and maybe some banana (although there's not banana in the picture.)  Like most of these things, getting the mix can be tricky.  After a few attempts, I've figured it out.  I think I'm using more than the squirt per 8oz, but that's ok.<br /><br />I don't usually feel caffeine (unless I drink a lot) so I can't really tell if this would affect a normal person.  The price seems high, but I don't really know how much you get from 12 oz of mix, compared to a box of pre-measured powders.  If a squirt is half an ounce, this is about twice as expensive as Crystal Light.  Of course the fact that it needs refrigeration may imply that it's a little more real than its competition.<br /><br />It's good enough that I might try the other flavors.

review/summary: OK, could be better
review/text: This is passable for a drink additive. Not great, not terrible. The vitamins are the best part.<br /><br />TASTE - 3 stars. Perfectly drinkable but nothing special. I would not go out of my way to buy this flavor in the future. Tasted sweet but with little natural flavor.<br /><br />POTENCY -- 1 star. I had to use twice the recommended amount to get the desired sweetness and flavor. Otherwise it was like drinking plain water.<br /><br />CONVENIENCE -- 4 stars. I do like the convenience of this. The squeeze drink additives are easier to use than the powdered ones in the packets (so easy to mix). However it is easier to travel with the powdered packets.<br /><br />NUTRITION -- 5 stars. It's a good thing that there are some vitamins in this. Any little bit helps.<br /><br />CAFFEINE -- 3 stars. Does there really need to be caffeine in it? I am not sensitive to caffeine so for me it doesn't matter much, but I can imagine a lot of people don't want extra caffeine in their flavored drinks.<br /><br />So, overall I give it 3 stars. In general I prefer Crystal Light powdered mixes and Mio which is more potent and smaller in size (so easier to carry).
