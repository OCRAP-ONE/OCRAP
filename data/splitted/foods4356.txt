review/summary: good amount of glucosamine, dogs love them
review/text: My dogs love all the Zukes stuff.  One of them has decided she doesn't like JointMax and I don't blame her, it doesn't smell all that great.  The Zukes have a goodly amount of glucosamine 300 mg per treat, and a lowish amount of chondroiten 50 mg.  I would like to have a little more chondroiten.  They don't have turmeric or MSM or any of the other supposed goodies but I'm not sure how much that matters.  Also, I smear peanut butter on them and stick other capsules into the peanut butter and everything gets snarfed down without argument.

review/summary: Zukes Hip Action treats and great eats
review/text: Nino who is a Shiba Ino just became 14. Nino was regressing into a severe case of arthritis on his rear legs about two years ago. I then placed him on a diet of Ark Naturals Sea ''Mobility'' Beef Jerky with Sea Cucumber, MSM and Glucosamine Supplement for Dogs and within a month showed significant improvement. We go on one mile walks in the morning for which she walks gracefully without any apparent ailment. Since there was a special advertised with Amazon on 3 Packs Zukes Hip Action Jerky Naturals BEEF and then product highly rated, I decided to buy Nino these treats. Not only is Zukes Hip Action Jerky Naturals preventing crippling arthritis on his rear legs, he looks forward to this treat after our morning walk.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I'm actually cooking this right now. My family lives in Hawaii and we're all big fans of Coco Ichibanya Curry House here, but it can get expensive. Vermont Curry tastes similar. Not quite the same, but still a really nice cheap alternative to spending 30 bucks to eat there. I tend to be lazy with the meat, so I usually go with a can of Costco roast beef (make sure you drain it and use water, not using the canned liquid as it makes it too salty) or hamburger. Not counting however long it takes you to cook rice, you can have dinner ready in just 45 minutes.<br /><br />If you've never had Japanese curry, it's sweeter than Indian curry but so freaking delicious. I've tried looking up how to make Japanese curry without blocks, but it's so much of a hassle that I figure I might as well just use this. One large carrot and one large Russett is enough for one of these boxes.

review/summary: A family tradition
review/text: My uncle brought back this favorite from his church mission in Japan. We actually prefer to mix the mild and medium hot together. Our recipe it to take a pot of water and add ingredients to it boiling as they are cut in the following order: chicken, carrots, potatoes, green peppers, onions. Then add curry mix. Just before serving add chopped apples, prefereably granny smiths. We serve over rice and mix it all together. My husband and I have added yams as another ingredient of choice. If it is too spcy we add a little brown sugar. This is my favorite meal!

review/summary: This does NOT taste like vanilla rooibos!
review/text: My wife and I bought this when Davidson's standard bulk rooibos was unavailable for some weeks.  We have had vanilla rooibos from other sources (Celestial Seasonings has a wonderful one), but all were bagged, and we prefer to use our infuser.<br /><br />Boy, this was a bad surprise!  Davidson's does not say there is any vanilla in the tea, just "natural flavors".  Unfortunately, those chosen "natural flavors" seem to range from anise to cardamom to caramel, but there really is no vestige of vanilla to be found.  Frankly, the taste is so unlike anything we would have wanted with our rooibos that we are going to give it to a family member with instructions to throw it away if she doesn't like it.<br /><br />We enjoy Davidson's red rooibos and green rooibos, their Silver Needles white tea, and their Spring bulk teas.  This one, however, is a perfect waste.<br /><br />Stay away from this!<br /><br />NOTE:  I gave it "2 stars" because the product is packaged very well and the rooibos quality appears to be as good as their normal unflavored rooibos.

review/text: I've tasted all of the different hostess cupcake flavors, and I like this one the least. They have a taste kinda like they were flavored with clear juice from an orange, but the cake consistency isn't as good as the chocolate ones. and the icing is a little more gooey. More orange flavor would have gotten them a higher rating but they are definitely worth a try. you won't dislike them.

review/summary: Great jam, great little jar
review/text: One of my guests bought this, and I didn't try it until I was cleaning out my fridge a month or so later. Very little was left, and it had crystallized, like honey does, but a few seconds in the microwave (without the lid) took care of that problem. This spread has a nice taste, not too sweet, with just the right touch of orange.<br /><br />In washing the jar in preparation for recycling, I noticed that it had a nice urn shape, with two little embossed 'handles' on its sides. I soaked the paper off of the lid, then cleaned the adhesive off with Goo-Gone, washed it well with soapy water, and voila! The lid is a beautiful lustrous green with gold accents, and no label or other inscription. My daughter has decided to keep this cute little jar for storage of some of the tea that she buys in bulk, so I view the packaging for this spread as a bonus.

It's a lot of ginger, but if you work out the cost per ounce, it's much cheaper than the smaller containers of quality ginger, and even a bit cheaper than the generic stuff you can buy at a discount (but worlds better in terms of taste).<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/summary: Biting, pungent, piercing
review/text: Recipes often call for a substitution ratio of 1 to 6 for using ginger root as opposed to ginger powder.  This powder is fresher than others I've tried, so that ratio won't apply.  It's fresh and penetrating.<br /><br />Besides the great taste, the benefits of ginger are vast.  In some studies, forms of ginger have been effective against a variety of cancers in mice.  The show, Mythbusters, ran a segment to debunk so-called remedies for motion sickness.  Mythbusters found that ginger is effective against motion sickness even while many others remedies were not.  Ginger has been used to treat constipation, colic, gastroparesis, dyspepsia, inflammation, coughing spells and soothe upset stomachs.<br /><br />There are warnings against taking too much ginger in powdered form, mainly because it's possible to consume more using the powder.  The FDA warns that too much powdered ginger can cause intestinal blockage, gas, belching, and that it's contraindicated for those suffering from gallstones because it promotes bile production.<br /><br />There is no end to ways of using powdered ginger in cooking and mixing in foods and beverages.  One of the famous juicing drinks is made from carrot, orange and ginger.<br /><br />I recommend this item for its freshness and economy, not to mention that ginger is so beneficial in one's diet.

review/summary: Very Good Ginger
review/text: I love ginger and haven't had it for a few years and I stumbled upon it here and when I read the reviews where people said it was too spicy I said to myself I have to try it!<br /><br />When I cut open the box, I accidentally sliced the non resealable two 16 ounce foil bags that were in a plastic bag. I don't mess around when I open shipping boxes and I could tell I sliced the foil bag. So I took a finger tip full of the ginger around my accidental slice and WOW! There definitely is a bite to it, but notlike a fingertipful of hot chili powder.<br /><br />The powder was pale gold which the picture describes and is a lot lumpier. The two foil bags are not resealable. I just cut the top off of one with a scissors and poured them in my containers. Easy pouring.<br /><br />I took the end of my teaspoon and filled it. I don't know if most put a full teaspoonful in and perhaps that's why to some it was super hot, but a teaspoon endful was plenty for my hot tea.<br /><br />When I ordered it and it had those choices of a schedule, and the "one time only delivery" I asked about that after I ordered because I'd never seen that before and if I liked this ginger I didn't want to be on a schedule  with automatic deductions because who knows if it's ever discontinued and it doesn't go out if you'll be refunded.<br /><br />This is very good ginger. It's worth the price. It's got just enough bite and it's by no means as tame as store bought, at least with me. These two bags will last months and when the time comes I'll definitely re-order.

review/text: I had searchced for "organic ginger powder" on Amazon and this was one of the listings. I wasn't sure about the quality since it does not state it is "organic" but it got such great reviews I decided to order and see. I have received my package and I have not opened it nor have I used it. I called the # on the bag to see if it was at least "pesticide free" or such.  I've confirmed with the lady at customer service that it is conventional, not pesticide free, not organic. This is of course fine for those who don't need/want an organic product this seems to be great according to past users.

review/summary: strong aroma, decent flavor, but not great
review/text: Really liked that it is grittier than most, so it is easier to pour and scoop out, but leaves a slight residue when dissolved in liquid. Probably fantastic for cookies or sauces. My Ginseng is so fine, that it plops out in  big clumps. Decent product at a very good price. Foil bag would keep it fresh for a long time, but I immediately put in a resealable jar for convenience.

I like preparing Asian style food and use a lot of ginger when I cook. The 2oz or 3oz containers at the grocery store get expensive. This is a great value! Caution - This is a lot of ginger!

We used to buy these at a super saver retail club but they quit carrying them.  Their loss and our gain as we found Amazon has them for considerably less and delivers right to the door.  All boxes to date were fresh (well within their "Best by" dates) and well packed.  These  treats make great rewards and pacifiers--we'd be lost without them!

review/text: I have a Westie and a Cairn Terrier so I go through a LOT of milk bones. My dogs love these multi flavor variety. It's my second time purchasing this and the first time I got them I wasn't sure how much milk bones were in 7 pounds, but trust me, it's a lot! I feed my two dogs on average 2 or 3 bones a day and the first box lasted about 5 months! My only complaint would be about the packaging. There is no way to close the top of the box all the way once it's open. I don't have a large enough canister to accommodate all 7 pounds so to keep them fresh so I just had to use 4 gallon size ziplock bags. It would be nice if the box top was like the smaller boxes of milk bones and had a tab so you could keep it closed.

Note that this is a very large box, and is a good value.  I would guess it has about 4 times as many biscuits as the size box you would normally find at a grocery store, but at only twice the price.

review/text: I've been on a long quest to make awesome theater type popcorn at home. This stuff is one of my tools for what I've finally tinkered into a great substitute for the $10 a barrel stuff you get at the multiplex these days.<br /><br />Here's how: I use a stir crazy type popper (a whirly pop works too). I throw in coconut oil, not this product and let it melt, since it's usually solid at room temp. Sprinkle with the appropriate amount of Flavacol & add kernels. Let pop. Drizzle with Orville's Butter Flavor Popping and Topping oil, sprinkle with fine dust of Flavacol again. AMAZING.<br /><br />Now, I wouldn't name this stuff popping and topping for theater type popcorn, because you need to pop in the coconut oil. Second, you might be able to get just SLIGHTLY better topping flavor in another buttery product, but they're almost all 100% trans fat, this has none... so this wins. Yum!

review/text: I received these wonderful chips yesterday in the mail, as I had been passively looking for them for quite some time.  They are awesome.  Hot and spicy taken to a new level, is what they are.  The flavor is equally awesome.  If you don't like spicy food, beware.  But if you do like spicy food, you'll be turned out and taken to a new level eating these chips.  Word of advice. Savour each and every chip slowly, as you will certainly have to take a break if you eat them like regular spicy/barbecue chips.

review/summary: Excellent Chips - Crunchy and Warm
review/text: I received these chips yesterday in the mail.  What a pleasant surprise.  They have a little Bar-b-que flavor and the kick doesn't start till the third or fourth one.  Yes, they get a little warm on the tongue and lips toward the middle of the bag. (I had to put them down for a while).  But the flavor is awesome..!  They are kettle cooked and thick and crunchy - I recommend them... and am going to place another order today.

review/summary: Not as good as others, to my taste
review/text: I first encountered Balsamic Cream in England a few years ago. When I was in Italy March 2008, I bought Mazzetti Balsamico Cremoso at a grocery store, which was wonderful and reasonably priced. Earlier this year I bought a couple varieties on Amazon, and I just bought a few more for holiday gifts, not all of which are making the cut! Here are my personal views of the ones I bought:<br /><br />#1 Casa Rinaldi Crema di Balsamico Blanco (white). This is not the dark Balsamic Cream I have had before, but of all the ones I've now tasted, this is my favorite. It is the perfect balance of vinegar and sweet, the texture is thick, but the flavor is light. Wonderful! ($11.95 for 8 oz from [...])<br /><br />#2 De Negris Balsamico Glaze - also a great flavor, balancing vinegar and sweet, but much thinner texture. Fine for dipping bread etc. ($11/7.3 oz) ($10/13.5 oz on Amazon)<br /><br />#3Da Magreta Acetaia Real Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modena (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena): second best flavor and thicker ($23/16.9 oz)<br /><br />#4 Modenaceti Balsamic Gkaze: thicker, good flavor, but more grapey than the others above. (3x13.5oz for $28)<br /><br />I also tasted Earthy Delights, which was thick and more tangy/vinegary than the others above. I'll use what I have, but probably not buy more. $14.50/500ml<br /><br />For my taste I would not again purchase Mussini Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modeno (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - sweet, grapey, caramel-y" and don't know what to do with Roland Balsamic Glaze (thick, but very, very vinegary - ugh).

My only complain is that these three huge bottles have an expiration date that's the same as the bottle I bought probably 2 years ago. That's kind-of frustrating. But other than that - love this!

review/summary: Less sweet than Trader Joe's
review/text: My kids loved the Trader Joe's version of balsamic glaze on their sandwiches (mozzarrella, basil, and tomato) , but then Trader Joe's discontinued it, and we ran out of our home stash, so I bought the Modenaceti.  Because it is not as sweet as the Trader Joe's, my kids don't like it quite as much, but it's still good.  I haven't tried any other brands.

I have since found MODENACETI at Kroger/Fry's, but the bottles are smaller and more expensive. Thank you AMAZON!

review/summary: Excellent product, cute shape, goodbye Kraft blue box!
review/text: We stopped buying the Kraft mac n' cheese once we got started on Annie's products. The kids love Arthur, and thought it was pretty cool to have Arthur shaped mac n' cheese (they are all Arthur heads, no Buster, D.W. or other Arthur faves). The cheese sauce tastes more like real cheese than the sweet, overprocessed Kraft sauce. Once you acquire a taste for Annie's, there's no going back! On the other hand, the kids' friends who come over for lunch often turn up their noses at our Annie's mac and cheese, because they are so accustomed to Kraft or the like. I like that Annie's are all-natural, too, but it's mainly the taste that keeps me coming back for more.

My son also loves organic food and this was a great alterative to regular store brands with character pasta.<br /><br />Adding organic sour cream or extra cheese to it just enhances the taste.  Amazon is a great way to purchase this product if you do not have a Fresh Market or a health food store in your area.

review/text: My kids had nothing but Annie's until they started school and had Kraft mac and cheese on a play date. They still prefer Annie's, which surprised and pleased me. They make both "totally natural" and organic mac and cheese, so your kids can have this perennial favorite without all the artificial colors and flavors. It could be a bit cheesier, but I just add a sprinkle of shredded cheddar on top.

review/text: A very tasty, very delicious, very fresh candy bar that I've purchased many times over the years and on Amazon for a great price. You receive around 15-17 fun size pieces per bag, and there are 6 bags per order. I paid just $11.48 for all 6 earlier today and as cheap as $8.32 last March when Amazon was dumping inventory for the impending hot summer weather from their warehouses during a day I happened to be online with some items that were candy related in my cart and saw all remaining candy in stock was swiftly and unannounced reduced by 50% or better of the list price! Weather you pay either eleven and change or eight in change, if the price is right and you like Butterfinger's�, this is a good bargain and the product for you. ENJOY!!!

I ordered this for when company stops over - Everyone loves to choose from my candy dish. Only problem was, I ate more than I shared. Uh oh. Not melted, but I didn't order during a warm time of year. Maybe during the summer, a cold pack is included....We'll see because I intend to order again.<br />Great buy. Great Price. And love the door to door service.
