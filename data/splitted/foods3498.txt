review/text: My concern before this was ordered was if it was made in the USA.  My e-mail was quickly answered with a yes.  If you are a crystallized ginger lover this is the place to get it.  GREAT price and GREAT taste.  We will order from this site again.  The only problem I have with it is keeping my husband from devouring it before I can use it in my baking.

review/summary: Love the flavours
review/text: I love all the flavors, orange spice is my favorite. One thing to keep in mind is that the flavors require different amount of water. It's probably a matter of taste but I would still say so. The Irish breakfast needs the most and ginger one the least, not much difference though. Once you get the perfect amount to your taste, you are gonna love them.

review/summary: Tasty assortment, great price
review/text: Ordering 100+ bags of black breakfast tea at once is a seriously big commitment for anyone, a commitment you really only should make when you know your way around your black teas. If you get a tea that you end up hating, all you'll get is 100+ rather disappointing mornings. So for people as inexperienced and undecided as me in the choosing and drinking of black tea, Stash has this sampler. It's always a small treat to wake up and be able to choose exactly what I want from the 20 or so bags of six flavors that I set out for myself. Even the ones I'm not crazy about are welcome variety because I can switch it up every morning.<br /><br />Grab this sampler if you want variety, if you want to take a plunge into black teas, and especially if you're looking at black tea as an alternative to coffee - I find about 2 ten ounce cups of tea give the same caffeine as one cup of coffee of the same size. If you're trying to reduce your caffeine intake, you can gradually dial it back to one cup, and steep that one cup longer. It's a (relatively) painless way to cut back.

review/summary: Love Stash tea
review/text: Bought this assortment mainly for guests, but we drink it every day! We received double spice chai instead of English breakfast tea, which was a bonus. Bergamot is what gives earl grey tea its distinctive flavour, so double bergamot earl grey is that much better. Orange spice might be my favorite, but the peach is excellent, too. I used to keep some ginger root in the freezer to grate and make tea (good for upset stomach) which was much less convenient. Now it doesn't take all that work, and I enjoy it just because I love ginger. Irish breakfast tea doesn't really have a special flavour, but it is a bit stronger, with more caffeine.

review/summary: Hot "Chocolate"?
review/text: This item, though a cute idea, really doesn't live up to its title. The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The "hot chocolate" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasn't fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly can't even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter.<br /><br />If you're looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls. However, if you're expecting something akin to hot cocoa as it is generally understood to be, I would look elsewhere.

This is the only set of hot cocoas that had a sticker of Raggedy Andy wrapped around the tin insted of it being imprinted on the actual tin.

review/summary: Luck O' the Irish Hot Chocolate Mix
review/text: Good thing I got this from the bargain bin or I would really be perturbed. Whatever the claims, this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind. A more correct description would be Coconut flavored drink mix. Apparently the 10 oz rating is including the weight of the "cauldron" because there's no way there was 10 oz of product inside. You might get three cups of "hot chocolate" per container if you like the "flavor" really mild.<br />It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price. Two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won't even be much use as decoration. Look for a better brand.

review/summary: Great, traditonal Chinese tea
review/text: I took this tea to some of my Chinese friends who are in the U.S. for a foreign exchange program at the university I attend. They all agreed that this tea tasted the same as what they have in China, the only difference is that in China their tea is loose-leaf, not in tea bags. The tea tastes great with and without sugar (my Chinese friends took it without sugar since that's the traditional way there I assume) and even I, who likes tea with some sugar think that it's great without the sugar, in fact, one sugar packet (I used Splenda) overwhelms the flavor of tea. If you want a good green tea with the traditional Chinese flavor, this is for you. The package did not lie in saying that it is "Unblended China Green Tea" it was worth every penny. The only thing is, amazon does not have the cheapest price (if you consider the cost of shipping) but whether you get it from amazon or from somewhere else, it is definitely a great tea.

review/summary: Awesome deal on quality organic sprouting seeds!!!
review/text: I've been buying my sprouting seeds from this company for quite a while. I love how high-quality they are, and that they have a high-yield and are organic. Most people who have never sprouted before may not realize that you can't use regular seeds from the garden center of a store to sprout. It takes specialty seeds. I have a huge pantry and am well-stocked-up on most everything we use on a regular basis. I wouldn't say I'm necessarily planning for Armageddon, but having food and water storage makes a lot of sense to our family. When my husband lost his job years ago, we had plenty to eat and used cash resources to survive til he got another job. Sprouts are a great way of providing optimum nutrition for your family, take almost no space, are always grown and eaten fresh and can be grown on a countertop or dresser or anyplace warm enough for you to be...no special equipment is needed--you can use a jelly jar if you want to. I have EasySprout sprouters, which make it easy because you can also use the container and snap the lid on it to refrigerate after the seeds have sprouted. They sell these sprouters here on amazon for about $12 and they are a great deal. This particular blend of seeds are very high in protein...so if you are wanting to go vegetarian or just cut down on your meat consumption, this blend is a great choice. I also sprout other things, like seeds and grains and put them into favorite family recipes. Very cheap, nutritious, green/earth-friendly and tasty. The added benefit for me personally is that my 6 yr old sprouts in her own sprouter and she is excited to eat what she grows!!  This is a child who used to refuse to eat most vegetables, so we're stoked about it.

review/summary: Roasted almond oil for superb salads
review/text: When I opened my first can of Roasted almond oil and sniffed,the aroma itself almost made me drool. I prepared a salad of fresh greens topped with fresh orange slices and dressed it with the roasted almond oil and an orange champagne vinegar. I have also used balsamic vinegar. I sprinkled the salad with toasted sliced almonds. Everyone I have served it to thinks it is the best. I have also added a little oil to steamed green beans and added toasted slivered almonds to that.

review/text: Great flavor! Be sure to refrigerate even before opening because oils tend to turn rancid if kept out. The only thing is I wish that I could have bought the oil separately instead of in packs of 3. It will take me years to use it all and with the possibility for rancidity I don't want to have to throw it away. As far as the product itself it is very good quality!

review/text: These oils are lighter in flavor than their descritions.  But still a good value. My Biggest problem was the cans were all damaged, not by shipping but by the individual that packaged them.  I ordered 5 of the different flavors, each oil has 3 or 4 cans with the offer.  In the first shippment 9 cans were crushed, not dented.  The 2nd order had 11 cans damaged.  My intent was to give these away as gifts; of course in that condition I was not able to!  If you want these oils for personal use by all means order them.

review/summary: Very happy with this product.
review/text: In the last couple of years, I have done a lot of research on healthy food products and healthy eating. So I have gotten away from using the various vegetable oils, and had been using primairly olive oil. When I found this product and some of the other nut oils, I now sometimes use them for the health benefits. I have been using this almond oil for a Ceasar dressing that calls for vegetable oil and it works great. Some of the nut oils can be used for frying and others are better for salad dressings and cold recipes. Some seem to feel that the nut oils add flavor, but this is not my experience. I really haven't noticed any difference in flavor, but the health benefits of nut oils are more than enough to convert recipes calling for vegetable oils.<br /><br />Some of the nut oils are also supposed to be good for the skin and hair. I have tried almond and macadamia oils on my face at night, and the skin does absorb it. I tried mac oil on my hair once, but wouldn't do it again. My hair was pretty well slicked down, and I washed the oil out immediately. For salads and any cooking that doesn't use high heat, I would highly recommend this almond oil for its health benefits.

review/summary: Picky Mastiff/Shep/Lab mutt
review/text: My 1 yr old Mastiff/Germ Shep/Lab mix Capone is PICKY! Basically when we got him he had been fed people food, not dog food. I spent well over a couple hundred dollars trying different dog foods, and out of all the dry kibbles, THIS is the ONLY thing he will eat. Not to mention, its cheaper than most of the other ones. I did ask my vet, and he said this was a great thing for him to gain weight. This dog is supposed to be a good 80-90 pounds, and hes only 75 pounds. When we got him he was 72, but hes gained a few since then, and that was back in late may/early june. This is probably the best food for a dog that likes gravy more than the actual food itself. Capone LOVES what I've always called his 'mush', and we used to do this for my last dog Dexter (cocker/lab) and he would eat just bout anything. Its great for a cold day, cause to them its basically like hot soup or a hot drink for us. Every morning he smacks the heck outa his bowl wanting me to make 'mush'. Sometimes when I dont make 'mush' he wants moist and meaty as a topper, but for a picky dog, go find some of this, dollar general has it where I live, they may in other places. Try this and moist and meaty if you have a half starved dog like I do. I've tried everything, beniful, purina, all that. The only stuff I wont give him is pedigree, mostly b/c my cat tries to eat it and it gives her VERY bad 'bombs' if you catch my meaning. He turned his nose at it. I swear if it wasnt for this dog food, my dog wouldn't be alive.

review/summary: One of the best gluten free crackers ever!
review/text: It's hard enough to find gluten free crackers that taste wonderful, and to be without seeds or nuts (these are on my "no" list too), but these Wellabys are tremendous. The only con I can think of is that it's extremely difficult not to eat the whole package in one sitting. I am grateful to have found these on Amazon. Personally, this is my favorite flavor out of the lineup, but the rosemary is pretty awesome too. If you can handle dairy, try some creamy blue cheese or Brie. Uh-oh... I think my calories are blown for the day!

review/summary: Some advice...
review/text: In reality, each bottle is worth two drinks or more. Here's how to get the most bang for your buck. After you spend $16.00 to $25.00 for the four-pack, buy a 1-liter of either (or both) Sprite and/or club soda for a couple of dollars.<br /><br />If you have a sweet tooth, do a 50/50 mix of Tru Blood with Sprite. If you prefer to dull the sweetness, then do the same but with club soda. Be creative and mix to your taste.<br /><br />Remember, this beverage has a slight fizz to it (carbonation), so you'll need a fizzy mixer to help it maintain its integrity.<br /><br />You might also want to keep you first empty bottle so that you can poor half of the subsequent bottle into the first bottle and store your mixes.<br /><br />Also tastes great with freshly-oxygenated arterial blood at 98.6F.  (Just kidding.)<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Jet<br /><br />-

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: This soda is really delicious.  I was able to try a sample of it at a booth at a local conference in Seattle and was instantly in love with it.  It's a very unique (and yummy) flavored soda because of the blood orange, and because of that it only makes spending the money for it worth it. It's sweet, but not overly so.  The bottles are quite hefty which adds to the authenticity, they really do look like the ones on the show.  Whether you are buying the soda for decoration (we have one of them on a shelf) or for drinking, it's worth the price for this unique soda.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: A tad TOO sweet
review/text: While I do think that the bottle design rocks, and it stays true to the bottles we see in True Blood, the drink itself, well... it's not BAD, but it's not great either.<br /><br />I didn't want to spend the $25 USD for the four pack I saw at Hot Topic, especially if I didn't know if I was going to like it, so thankfully Saturday Matinee sells the single bottles for about $5 USD a pop.<br /><br />Tru Blood actually tastes better warm, or at least room temp, which I found out after popping my bottle in the fridge. And it's not something you can chug. It is very much something I could only sip a bit at a time. It tastes more like a REALLY sweet fruit punch, but I couldn't find any hint of blood orange in it.<br /><br />If you're not a fan of overly really sweet drinks, I wouldn't recommend it, but if you DO like really sweet stuff, then go for it.<br /><br />I will say, though, that every fan of the True Blood series should try the drink at least ONCE. Build your own opinion from tasting it yourself. If you're not willing to drop $25 for a 4 pack of it, you can sometimes find the single bottles at Borders, the larger Barnes and Nobles stores, or Saturday Matinee.<br /><br />I would also recommend that people who are diabetic, STAY AWAY. Sugar cane is the second ingredient in Tru Blood.

review/summary: MUST OWN!!!!
review/text: Okay, maybe not a "must own" unless you are a die hard fan of the series but I am so I just had to have this!!! I first saw them at Hot Topic and was a little sad that they were $25 for only four bottles, but in all honesty these are pretty big bottles and very, idk how to describe it properly, "Solid"?? Very durable product. I mostly wanted them just for fanboy sake, I didn't really care what it tasted like. But I did open one bottle, gave two away to my friends who are big fans. And I kept one unopened bottle for display. The flavor of the drink to me is a little odd, I am very surprised that they picked an Orange flavor instead of Strawberry or Cherry since the drink is supposed to be red like blood. All in all its decent, I couldn't drink it as if it was soda or anything but I will take an occasional sip from time to time. But like I said I mostly wanted these just to have since Im such a huge fan of the show so anyone else who is the same should definitely pick these up!!!

review/summary: Despite the cost, it's worth it
review/text: I really enjoy this drink and have just bought my third pack.  First of, consider that you are actually buying heavy glass, solid prop replicas.  The drink inside doesn't matter so much.  The bottle is most important.  It looks just like the show.  It's very large and substantial in your hand.  Also the glass is quite thick and heavy.  But what's disappointing is that it has a paper label.  I really wish it was something more long lasting.  However, if you're careful you can wash out the inside and mouth of the bottle without ruining the paper and reuse these.  There's something just really enjoyable and rewarding about holding this heavy bottle that feels like you're drinking something really from the show.<br /><br />As for the drink itself, I actually don't find it sweet tasting.  I think it tastes a lot like Orange Crush, but a little bit less fizzy and more complex.  I wish it was more carbonated.  At first I didn't care much for the taste, but the more I drink, the more and more I like it.<br /><br />To get your money's worth, though, just wash them out gently and refill with some Orange Crush or Sprite and a few drops of red food coloring if you want.

(I felt the need to take away a star from the product because it had an abundance of carbonation.)  The packaging is nice and would be a good collector's item for any fan of the show.

review/text: I went to Georgia a few months ago and I tried boiled peanuts for the first time. And I'm not going to lie I fell in love with them. But ever since I've gone back home to California I haven't been able to find them anywhere. They are not sold in any of the stores so thank god they sell them on Amazon. It took about a week to arrive and they taste just as good as I remembered. Just make sure that when you order them that you or someone else is there to sign off for it. They will not drop off the package unless there is someone there to sign for it. I found out the hard way because when it arrived I had work so I had to stop by the UPS store to pick it up. Talk about a big line. But otherwise this is the cheapest place that I have found so far online and believe me I looked forever for these peanuts. But you will not be disappointed they taste amazing.

review/summary: Too Spicy for Me
review/text: I am a Southern Gal living in California and had been looking for boiled peanuts online for some time. The shipping costs for frozen ones are prohibitive for my budget, so I decided to buy these nuts.  We are talking here about a canned product, so I don't think it's fair to judge it based on its comparison to freshly boiled peanuts, however, there were several 'bad' nuts and the overly-spicy flavoring made this take a 3-star rating.  I just washed the peanuts carefully and they weren't too bad.  I have just ordered the regular, plain salted, peanuts and they are much better for me.  I've only had 3 cans of the regulars so far, yet they somehow seem to be of a better quality than the Cajun ones.  Hope this helps others make a decision on whether or not to buy.

review/summary: Royal Basmati Rice, Food for Royalty
review/text: We keep a burlap bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LRH6DQ">Basmati Rice (Royal) 20lb</a> on hand.  With the current fear of rice shortage, we suggest you get yourself a bag of this rice now.<br /><br />Royal Basmati Rice brings eating rice to a new level.  I first learned about it a few years ago in New Orleans at a combination Middle Eastern restaurant/grocery.  The owner there had not heard someone from Mississipi talk before, and he kept following me around the store because he was fascinated with my accent.  He asked me if I was from Scotland.  He sold me my first bag of Royal Basmati. "This is what we use to feed our customers," he said.  I had no idea that rice could taste that good.<br /><br />Here is the way the Royal people recommend you cook it:<br />Cooking Instructions for Stovetop<br /><br />1 cup of uncooked Royal Basmati Rice yields 3 cups cooked Rice.<br /><br />Measure: 1 cup of rice, 1 � cups of water, 1 tablespoon of oil, butter or margarine, a pinch of salt.<br /><br />1. Rinse measured rice 1 to 2 times or until water is clear to remove extra starch and drain.<br />2. Place the drained rice into the saucepan and add measured water, oil and salt.<br />3. Place saucepan (uncovered) over high heat and bring to boil, stir occasionally.<br />4. Let water reduce slightly below the rice level and the lower the heat to the minimum.<br />5. Place a tight lid on the saucepan and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.<br /><br />Herre is the way we cook it:<br />We don't wash it.  We simply place 1 cup of Basmati rice and 2 cups water in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009W7E8K">Calphalon Tri-Ply Stainless-Steel 8-Quart Stockpot with Glass Lid</a>.  We bring it to a boil and cook it at medium heat until the water is absorbed.  That's all.<br /><br />The rice is supposed to last two years if kept under 70 degrees.  It can be refrigerated.  We simply keep it on the shelf without a problem.<br /><br />Cooked rice can be kept in the refrigerator for six days or frozen up to six months. To reheat just add 2 tablespoons of liquid, cover and heat for about 5 minutes on top of the stove or 1 minute on HIGH in the microwave. Fluff with a fork.<br /><br />You can freeze  Basmati rice before or after cooking. Store it in an airtight container to prevent frost from forming on it<br /><br />Here is a dish using Basmati from Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook:<br />SHRIMP CURRY<br />2 pounds medium raw shrimp, peeled and deveined (Country girls don't devein their shrimp.)<br />2 tablespoons peanut oil (or canola oil if peanuts are a problem)<br />3 large garlic cloves, minced<br />� cup green onion, diced<br />� cup pea pods, strings removed<br />4 cups assorted oriental vegetables, chopped into large pieces Juice of 1 lime<br />3 blocks Golden Curry Sauce Mix� (mild or for Louisiana tastes,  medium hot)<br />2 tablespoons chicken broth<br />� cup unsalted cashews<br />1 cup uncooked rice (Basmati is excellent with shrimp curry.)<br /><br />Prepare the rice according to the package instructions.  Heat the chicken broth in a small saucepan and stir in the curry blocks until they are dissolved.  Heat oil in large non-stick stove top skillet, electric skillet, or wok. Add garlic and green onions and stir over medium heat 1 minute. Add pea pods, assorted vegetables, lime juice, curry blocks, and chicken broth and stir over medium heat 3 to 4 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but still crisp.  Add the shrimp and cook while stirring gently 2 to 3 minutes.<br /><br />Serve over rice and topped with cashews. 4 servings<br /><br />Here is a recipe using Basmati rice from The Collard Patch<br /><br />CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE COLLARD ROLLS<br /><br />Rice<br />Ingredient<br />� cup uncooked rice (Basmati is excellent.)<br /><br />Preparation<br />Cook the rice according to package instructions, but do not add salt.

It has a superior flavor and aroma over the other basmatis we've tried, and the grains cook up so much nicer and fluffier.<br /><br />To truly appreciate this fine rice, I would highly recommend following the directions to rinse the rice first.  It DOES make a difference.

review/summary: Cooks well!
review/text: This rice cooks quite well.  We're enjoying it.  The only drawback is that the rice is shipped in a burlap bag.  The odor of the burlap interferes with its natural flavor and aroma that I've come to cherish.  I've even washed it several times in an attempt to wash away the burlap smell/flavor.  It doesn't work.  If you're OK with that, then you'd like this rice.

review/summary: Horrible smell of this product
review/text: The rice was shipped in a burlap bag as I expected.  Inside the burlap bag the rice was inside a plastic bag.  However, the plastic bag was partially opened and the entire bag of rice smelled horrible from the burlap or the paint on the burlap. Perhaps this opening was from the way the filled the plastic bag but they made no effort to completely seal the plastic before putting it into the burlap.  I tried this rice anyway and the finished rice also tasted of something still picking up the burlap smell.  DO NOT BUY THIS RICE.  If there was a zero rating I would have given it that, one star is too much.<br /><br />Update 4.23.2012:  Contacted the seller and they are allowing me to return this item and fully refund my costs along with providing prepaid shipping back to them.  Can't ask any better of a vendor, they are top rate.

review/summary: Excellent rice!
review/text: I have been using Royal Basmati rice for something on the order of 30 years, having been introduced to it by a friend from India.  I live in Hawaii where a lot of things are ill available.  That said this is the brand carried by our local costco and so it is my default.  My *only* issue with it is the size of the bag.  I generally spend and hour or so repacking it for storage once I have opened the bag: something of a chore... and it does provide a challenge in terms of storage space.  All that said I came here looking for Basmati in smaller packages, but have to say that on one occasion I tried a different brand and it did not cook up as well: was a bity grainy and softer- did not hold up well (got soft, broke down a bit).  in terms of taste... I am 100% satisfied with this brand.  i just wigh it was available in smaller apckages!<br /><br />I will offer some advice to people new to Basmati.  it is a long-grain white rice: softer and more absorbent than brown rices or short grain white.  the way I prepare it (as I was taught by my friend who is a life-long consumer (for lack of a better word)<br /><br />1. rinse well.  Measure the quantity you want. (note: it cooks up to 2-3 times the bulk of the dried rise: very fluffy!)  Rinse in cold water swishing it around in the pot and continue rinsing until the water runs clear.  if you do not do this the rice will be stickier and not as fluffy.  some people like it this way (i do not).<br />2. Use less water than you normally would with white rice.  I generally measure 1 to 1, or just a bit more water: around 1 1/4 cup of water to one cup of rice.  I make mine in a rice cooker, and if you make it on the stove top or with a pot which is not air tight you may need to use more water as some will boil off.  Add a pinch of salt and small amount of butter: a small pat for 1-2 cups of rice.  I frequently add saffron or turmeric to the water, occasionally cinnamon and or nuts/ raisins. (when I am serving it with curry).  The rice is very absorbent and takes spices nicely.<br />3. When it is done cooking let it rest for a few minutes off the heat source.  Fluff with a fork before serving.  the rice at the bottom of the pot typically absorbs a bit more water.  i stir it in to distribute before it sits.  that generally equalizes the moisture so you get an even texture.<br /><br />I don't know why I am even thinking of messing with something that works ;)  This is a product I have been very happy with for a long time!  I have never  found bugs or hulls or bits of detritus like I have when purchasing in bulk bins at the health food store.  My one and only issue is the size of the bag.  I really wish I could get this in 5 pound bags (and am sure apartment dwellers would share that sentiment).  This is a lot of rice, BUT, it is the only white rice I buy/ use so we never have a problem finishing it.  My only issue is storage space.

review/text: My boyfriend and I love this rice.  We can't seem to mess it up.  We had a smaller sized bag from the local grocery store -- I saw a review about the burlap flavor from the 15 lb bag -not sure if its in an inner plastic bag like the smaller one but no burlap flavor with the smaller bag.  The directions recommend rinsing the rice.  We rinse at least 3 times and work the grains between fingers. If not, it has a very grainy texture from the extra starch apparently.<br /><br />I have started making Thai and Indian food and this rice really helps make the dishes.<br />This rice is very aromatic and could easily be eaten plain -- almost dessert like.<br /><br />Tonight I had another brand which wasn't as aromatic and it did not turn out as perfectly.

review/text: I've been reading through some amazon reviews concerning groceries, because honestly I was a bit hesitant to order food online. Some of the reviews were really bad, saying that they received open packages blah blah, others were of satisfied customers. I went with the latter and ordered, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />My first box of Anna's thins was purchased at IKEA cause they are swedish cookies, and I fell in love with them. They are the perfect cookie for me. They are so thin (meaning less calories!) and bursting with flavor. The Chocolate mint is my favorite! They use good cocoa and real peppermint oil! Nothing artificial. And the price is perfect at Amazon with free shipping!!! I received the box is perfect condition with all the individual boxes inside ALSO in perfect condition. So I have to say I will be ordeing more groceries from Amazon. I highly recommend this cookie it's very well balanced, and not icky sweet, just right.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Cookies delicious; packing the WORST!
review/text: I have been a fan of Anna's cookies for years and the ginger have long been my favorites, so when I saw this price I jumped.  Too fast.  The shipment arrived in about 10 days (awfully slow for such a huge company, IMO) - cookies appeared to be well-packed in their own little case.  However we opened them to find that each and every box, of twelve, contained cookie crumbles.  Not one single cookie in shipment arrived unscathed; OK, I guess, to crumble on ice cream, etc. - but definitely not what we'd wanted.  Returning all 12 today; we'll see how Amazon handles that.

review/summary: Taste delicious, however most cookies arrived broken
review/text: We love these cookies, and have eaten them for years. Sadly, (although double boxed) two thirds or more of the cookies arrived badly broken. Very few cookies were whole, they still taste good, but they would not be suitable for serving.

review/summary: yes they really are THIN.... and tasty, even as crumbles.
review/text: Yes, some of the thin crackers are broken, but it was obviously not due to Amazon's shipping-- the box containing the crackers was thoroughly wrapped in bubblewrap which was carefully packed with other packing material in a larger box.  A few of the crackers at one end of each 5.25 ox box are broken, but they taste just as good as the whole ones.  Very nicely gingery.  Not, to be frank, as gingery as Trader Joe's "Triple Ginger Thins", but TJ's does not ship, and the closest one to Miami is in Atlanta... so these will do quite nicely.  I've signed up for a subscription.

review/summary: Not the best flavor....
review/text: I LOVE the ginger thins, so thought I would try some of their others. These were the worst of the bunch. (I also tried almond cinnamon & chocolate. These tasted like they had been cooked too long and they tasted burnt. To look at them, they were only a little brown. I LOVE lemon coolers and these didn't have much of a lemon flavor at all. I would not buy them again.

review/summary: lemon cookies
review/text: Love Anna's cookies but ordered this many did not work. The last six boxes even though they had previously been unopen began to loose the lemon flavor and the last four boxes the cookies became limp. Will still continue to buy Anna's cookes but not a dozen at a time.

review/text: It tastes so good and I love it very much!<br /><br />I agree with the other buyers that this cookie is very easy to break into small pieces.<br /><br />If the packing can be improved, I will give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Totally terrific, suited to an adult's taste
review/text: A really high quality cookie with a delicate tang of blueberry and a slight buttery taste.  Finely milled flour, so the texture is not coarse.  Very, very nice.<br /><br />This brand is also sold at Ikea as a scandanavian-type cookie and Amazon's sale price is well below Ikea's.

review/summary: Good cookies, but....
review/text: Be careful what you order along with these cookies. We made the mistake of getting a 5 pound bag of Gummi Bears at the same time. They apparently fought the whole way to our house, and the Gummi Bears won! They don't call them "thins" for nothing you know. The packing job was not the best, and many of the thins had turned into crumbs. Time for a chocolate pie crust I guess.
