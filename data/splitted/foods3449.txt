review/text: This product is refined cornstarch.  I'm not sure what the difference is between regular cornstarch and refined cornstarch.  I compared the both....I couldn't tell the difference.  The clear jel does just what cornstarch does for pie fillings.  I purchased it for canning pie fillings believing it to be better.  I believe I will continue using store bought constarch to avoid the hazzle of purchasing online and to avoid the high shipping costs.

review/summary: This sets us apart
review/text: My customers love our blended coffee drinks. They always comment on how much better they are than others in town (and living in the North West there are many others in town). What makes them better is Frozen Xplosion. It changes the texture of the blended drink from icy to creamy so much so that many have asked if we use ice cream in our drinks. Yes, it brings up the cost of our drinks, but we pass it along to our customers as a .50 cent charge to blend the drink. We can use less syrup in our blended drinks with Frozen Xplosion too, due to the sweetness of the powder.<br />This is a great product!<br />D.<br />Old Town Battle Grounds, BG Washington

review/summary: The Best Frappe Base On The Market
review/text: Hello,<br />Every Espresso stand that sells frappes should look at this. In my opinion Frozen Xplosion's greatest strength lies in its diversity. You literally can put anything you want with this drink. I have had such a blast coming up with new drinks, and the part that I especially enjoy is that since it is so diverse I can look up on the internet signature drinks that are made throughout the world and make a similar if not better drink. Even Indonesia's popular drink "chocolate avocado" went well with Frozen Xplosion, and that is just the beginning. With this base you can make your business the center of attraction with all the popular drinks such as "strawberry, raspberry, orange, cherry, apple, coffee, mocha, ect. And like I mentioned if you are wanting to have a more international draw to your business anything you can think of can be created into a signature drink. Frozen Xplosion is the best there is.

review/summary: Not a great choice...
review/text: I bought these soups not realizing the following--the soup cup is two servings---that means that this is 340 calories and a whopping 660 mg of sodium.  I guess you could eat half the container, but what do you do with the rest?  Despite this (hey, I bought it...), I made the soup and was unimpressed.  It tasted salty and stale.  I have had other dehydrated soup cups (great for traveling) and this is by far one of the worst ones that I have had.  Too many calories, too salty and too complicated to make (you just don't pour in boiling water and wait a couple of minutes).  I find that the Nile Spice soups are better and certainly less fattening.<br /><br />I am a bit surprised that Dr. McDougall would create a product like this.  I thought it would be more healthful!

review/summary: Nasty
review/text: I tried this as a break from heavy lunches.  I found it really nasty. The flavor powder clumps up, no matter how vigorously you stir the mess, and the beans stay a bit too hard.  The final texture is like maple syrup with lumps.  The flavor is horrid -- dried something, but no resemblance to any food I've had (and homemade black bean soup is a favorite).  This seems to be a product devised by someone who considers food only a nutrient object, not a potential source of joy in life. I cannot recommend this to anyone who has taste buds.

review/summary: Great for Work!
review/text: I have a hectic job that doesn't often allow me a lunch break so Dr. McDougall's products work out great for me. I follow a high protein diet and this Black Bean soup is loaded with both fiber and protein without sacrificing taste. Just add boiling or very hot water and you can easily eat it at your desk as it takes up about as much space as a large coffee mug. Many reviewers find the sodium content high and, as with most soups, it is. A good workaround to resolve this is to pour in about half of the flavor packet. There is minimal flavor change and a decrease (even though it may be slight) in sodium. I heartily recommend this soup for not only those on the go, but also for those who enjoy great soups.

review/text: Tasty, fiber-rich and low fat, this instant lunch is also very filling.  The only thing holding me back from a perfect "5" rating is the relatively high sodium content, 660 mg. per package.  However,considering the 28 grams of fiber (112% of the daily requirement), I guess the trade-off is worth it.  Probably wouldn't taste as good without the salt anyway!

review/summary: Delicious, great flavor, one of my favorites
review/text: This is one of my favorite flavors of Dr. McDougall's brand of soups and mixes. The texture is pleasing to me along with the spices. Yes, it's a dried soup mix so you can get clumps sometimes, but nothing a good stir with a spoon can't fix. Plus, the larger size soup cup means I can eat this with a little something extra to make a nice lunch. Oh, and if you are looking for a hearty lunch, try pouring this over rice or some other starch.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to see this offered through Amazon. Check out the split pea cup, too, that's my other favorite.<br /><br />Also, compared to the "Fantastic Food" brand soup , I've always found the Dr.McDougall soups to be thicker, have more spices, and be more filling. This is the perfect vegan cup of soup when you don't have time to bring/make your own. If you intend to make your own, check out Dr. McDougall's Quick and Easy cookbook.

review/summary: Decent if you don't use the whole flavor packet
review/text: We tried this first with none at all of the so-called flavor packet, and then added a little tiny bit of the packet. Adding just a tiny bit of the packet was plenty. If one were to add the entire flavor packet it would be too salty. There is a lot of salt in this, but thankfully one can avoid that by not using the full flavor packet. We added a little less water than suggested, and still found it to be more watery than we liked. The easy solution, of course, is to add even less water. On the whole, if one does not use the flavor packet it is pretty decent. I have recently had the very expensive per oz shredded black beans from Barry Farms which I prefer to this - those are just pure black beans. The prize per oz for the Barry Farms item is very steep, however.

review/summary: Vegan Natural Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. High protein. Nice black bean soup flavor. Becomes quick thick and hearty, especially for an instant cup type soup. Great with tortilla chips, wholegrain crackers, or a slice or two of crispbread. The lime and garlic flavor notes are mild and delicious. Great for warming up after any outdoor activity especially in chilly weather. Add a can of organic pintos (or other beans) and/or some diced veggies such as green bell peppers (or hot peppers) and tomatoes for added serving size. Can easy be used as a ready to go flavor maker for your own bean soup creations. Made with pre-cooked black beans, dehydrated veggies (garlic, onion, tomato, bell pepper), lime juice powder, cilantro, chipotle chili, cumin, coriander, black pepper, organic cane juice, yeast extract, natural flavors (vegan), and sea salt. Mix the flavor packet in the cup thoroughly before adding hot water. Let stand re-covered as recommended for 8+ minutes and then re-stir well.

review/summary: It's so great to have a healthy vegan choice when in a rush!
review/text: I use the McDougall products for quick lunches and dinners at work when I can't take time to go out to eat (which usually coincides with not being able to cook at home!) I keep salt, pepper, and Herbs de Provence in my office and always try to have some cut-up veggies (washed and bagged peppers, carrots, grape/cherry tomatoes, potatoes, and broccoli are staples but when peas in the pod are in season, I try to have them, too - anything I have in the fridge is fair game). With his lentil soups, after I nuke the soup, I usually nuke a spud and while it's cooking cut up half a pepper and 5-6 tomatoes and maybe half a carrot and put them in a bowl. I nuke them in for the last minute that the spud needs, and then mix in the soup. Filling, better for you, and GOOD! I don't have a problem with sodium but if necessary I add a little (because of the extra veggies, sometimes it's necessary) and I almost always add Herbs de Provence and pepper. I like all of the McDougall products - they are lifesavers when work gets crazy or at night when I'm very tired from long hours.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon, for making this available as McDougall will not ship to APO addresses and those middleman companies like ShipItAPO are EXPENSIVE! I was about to give up on McDougall products when I thought to check if you sold this - and you do! Hallelujah! ;-)

Easy to make with boiling water.  I like this flavor best.  Loaded with protein!<br /><br />some people complained that this one was very "mud like", but they just didn't stir their boiling water right.  Since the one is a thick soup, just make sure to stir it a few times while making it to ensure you mix it properly.  I've screwed it up once or twice and its kinda gross, but still can be choked down.  If you stirr it well several times, its very yummy!

review/summary: Filling soup, satisfying flavor
review/text: I like Dr. McDougall's soups and often bring them to work when I want to eat a quick lunch, or have a satisfying snack that will help me feel satiated all afternoon. I like the taste and texture of this soup. I don't find that it's too thick or too thin as others have written. You can always add either more or less water to get the texture that you're looking for. Beware that this soup container has 2 servings of the soup and so all of the nutritional information has to be doubled when figuring how many calories and how much sodium you're taking in. What I typically do is add only half the flavor packet to the container of soup. This way, I significantly reduce the amount of sodium. The soup is very high in fiber, relatively low in fat and will keep you satisfied for hours.

review/text: I've ordered this soup several times; both my husband and I enjoy it. However the seasonings tend to give me heartburn, so I use only about half the pack - still plenty of flavor, but with less frequent heartburn. Very filling due to high protein and fiber content; will be ordering this for years to come.

review/text: This is the best dehydrated soup I have ever tasted. And it is packed with nutrients: 20g protein, 28g fiber, 60g carbs. Low sugar and moderate sodium. Very nutritous. I put it on a piece of chicken breast to make a stew - mmmm, good! Kind of expensive if you get it at the store, but Amazon's subscription program makes it very reasonable.

review/text: I have served this product to numerous friends of all ethnicities, ages, genders, and to people who think they're not going to like it because it comes in a carton.  I've served it to vegetarians and meat lovers.  I've served it cold, as a party dip. I've served it to my kids and grandkids and I've even given it as a Christmas gift.  Everybody has loved it and asked where they can get it.  Nothing but high praise thr this item. It is indistinguishable from beans that are cooked from scratch, and I am pleased that it is highly nutritious.  Definitely merits five stars!

I don't taste any lime, but it is a very flavorful soup. If you like black beans, you are bound to love this soup. I thought the package size sounded small, but it isn't. It's a very substantial, filling and satisfying meal. It is also lightweight to carry and simple to prepare.

review/summary: I just love this soup!
review/text: I have been buying these at my local health food store on sale which is sometimes cheaper than Amazon. But I wanted to buy a lot because we have been working so much lately that it has been really hard to get in good, quick, satisfying meals. The flavor of this soup is wonderful. The lime and cilantro make it very tasty and flavorful. I love most of the flavors, but like black bean and spring onion the best. My husband really loves the hot and sour, tamale and tortilla flavors. The black bean soup is super filling and I can definitely see why there are two servings in each cup. Sometimes I struggle to eat the whole thing unless I'm really hungry. Black beans are naturally high in calories but they are so good for you and have so much fiber (28g per cup). I really don't see why people have complained about the serving size/calorie content. I have never gained weight eating these and on the contrary have lost weight given the large amount of fiber. I have had to struggle with my weight in the past like many people and have come to realize that calories aren't worth counting if the food isn't really good for you in the first place. Overall, I really like this soup and when prepared correctly (add seasoning, stir, add boiling water, stir well, then cover for 8 minutes and stir again), it is absolutely delicious.

review/text: I love this soup a lot. It is a good portion. Healthy ingredients. Thick and full of flavor. It is just unbelievable that this is hot-water food! I have tried other McDougall's soups and this is by FAR the best (the ramen and noodle type soups are atrocious compared to their Black Bean Soup and their GREAT oatmeals). Highly recommended. Great dorm food for the college kids too.

review/summary: Amazing for an instant soup. Totally the best DMRF instant soup...creamy texture, nicely spiced, filling. Wow!
review/text: I've tried several of the DMRF soup and products. Some of the soups were pretty bland and not worth repurchasing. Some I liked quite a bit--the split pea, the spring onion, the boxed vegetable, for example. This instant soup from the line is the best. I like it even more than then ready-to-serve bean one (I have that one at home, too, as well as the lentil of the boxed ones.)<br /><br />I boil water and pour it in and cover the cup (with a bread plate) and let it sit for several minutes. It ends up a richly thick soup, creamy-bean texture (which is how I like my black bean soup and red bean soups), and it actually has flavor. You can smell the cumin right off when you open the flavor pack to stir into the beans.<br /><br />I'm Cuban. I grew up eating some sort of legume/pulse/bean just about every day. As poor immigrants, black bean or red bean or chick peas or lentils or split peas or white beans were a big part of our daily dinners. Black bean soup is one of those quintessential Cuban specialties. This one has more of a Mexican vibe, but it's very n ice. Even this bean-freak can say this is a lovely instant soup, surprisingly so (instant and "lovely" don't always go together).<br /><br />Be aware that this one large cup is considered two servings, so the total calories for eating the whole cup (as I do) is 340. It has 28 grams of fiber (really?!!), so it's mighty filling. Add some rice or crackers or toast or something to turn it into a complete protein and add fruit or a light salad and you have a very satisfying meal for a not unreasonable amount of calories. If you only have half the cup and save the rest, your damage is minimal (ie, if you're on a weight loss program). Sodium is not unreasonable for a convenience soup.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this one in Dr. McDougall's line, do so. If you love beans, this should definitely make you happy.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Great to take to lunch
review/text: I only have an hour between classes, and have to have a quick lunch. The black bean and split pea soups by Dr. McDougall are great for that. I just add boiling water from my Hot Shot water dispenser, mix, let sit, and in a few minutes it's ready. I find it tasty, not overly spicey (most would find it 'very mild' but I am sensitive to 'heat,' so I taste a bit of kick in it). If you add less than the regular amount of water, it works well as a filling for burritos, etc.<br /><br />I star deducted for the rather high sodium content (I would not consider 1/2 a container a 'meal,' so I eat the whole thing).

review/summary: Good when you're in a hurry
review/text: Homemade soup is usually the best, but when you're in a hurry or away from home where there aren't a lot of healthy choices, this soup is very handy.  It's easy to prepare, just remove the flavor packet and pour it into the cup, stir and then add boiling water to the handy fill line and stir again.  Then wait about 5 minutes and it's ready to eat. You can then pour it into a cup or bowl or just eat it out of the package.  Very handy for taking to work or in a hotel room where you have boiling water available. (Use the coffee pot in the room if there is one.)<br /><br />I'm trying to get away from cans due to the BPA in the lining of most of them.  Whether it's harmful or not, there is certainly enough controversy and I figure it's better to be safe than sorry.  These soups solve the problem and the cardboard containers are easier to dispose of than metal cans.<br /><br />Each cup contains 2 servings at 170 calories each, in case you're counting.  340 calories isn't bad for a soup that's filling because of the beans.<br />The ingredients are:<br />Pre-Cooked Black Beans, Dehydrated Vegetables (Garlic, Onion, Tomato, Bell Pepper), Natural Lime Juice Powder, Spices (Cilantro, Chipotle Chili, Cumin, Coriander, Black Pepper), Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Yeast Extract, Natural Flavors (Non-Animal Source).<br /><br />The taste is pretty good for a product that is dehydrated and tastes better than a lot of canned soups.

review/text: I like this soup a lot and find the amount of spice to be just right. To be truthful, though, I don't detect much of a lime taste to it. I have found the key to this soup is to let it sit much longer than the directions say. That way, it is cool enough to eat and the soup gets nice and thick. So I just add boiled water to it, stir, and come back a half hour later. Perfect!

review/text: I've been buying Dr. McDougall's soup for years.  As a vegetarian, I appreciate not having to worry about what's in it.  The black bean & lime soup gets thick, is a hearty portion, and is great over rice for a full meal.  My one gripe is that it tends to boil over in the microwave.  So I cook it half the time, let it settle, then finish it up.

review/text: I sit here eating this yummy soup as I write this review. I'm not a big fan of instant anything but sometimes convenience is just better.  Open flap, mix in spice packet, add water, cook a minute and a half, wait 8 minutes (the hard part) and there you have it...a very good tasting, hearty, filling soup.  I couldn't really taste the lime flavoring, so I added a little garlic powder and small scoop of low fat sour cream.  I bought this at my local Sprouts store for 1.79 each, so Amazon does have a pretty good price.  I love that I found another healthy vegetarian option for work that tastes great.

review/summary: Yummmmm!
review/text: I am neither vegan nor health obsessed, but I keep a stock pile of Dr. McDougall's hot cereal and soup cups in my desk at work. The Black Bean & Lime Soup is my favorite. It tastes fresh and homemade, has just a hint of spiciness, and it's satisfying. As an added bonus, it's good for you. What more could you want from an instant lunch.

review/summary: Fiber Filler
review/text: This is super good!  It's hard to believe that all that flavor can come from a soup-in-a-cup.  The cup is supposed to be 2 servings, but who are they kidding?  The full cup is a delicious, nutritious lunch or dinner that is quick and easy to prepare, plus has your daily recommended fiber!  I add boiling water, instead of microwaving the cup.  For some reason, nuking the cup always results in a burnt cup.

review/summary: Good taste.  Easy to fix. It's a good lunch option.
review/text: I take this to work when I don't have time to cook lunch for myself.  I mix in the spices, fill it to the line with hot water out of the water dispenser/cooler at work.  I let it sit the 8 minutes and then eat.  It's thick and tastes good and fills me pretty well for the afternoon.<br /><br />If I didn't have easy access to hot water, it would be a bit harder because I would have to heat it in the microwave.  My one complaint is about the water fill line.  Why do they put it on the opposite side of the package from where you open it?  It makes no sense.  It is not a deal breaker for me though.

review/summary: Quite tasty. Be aware of 8min "wait time" [somewhat optional]
review/text: This is a fairly simple product review.<br /><br />I like the soup quite a bit. I normally save such things when I run out of food on campus, but occasionally I've had these because I like them. I went out on a limb because it was a very good price, but I would get them despite a higher price right now. Meaning, it is tasty.<br /><br />What my title refers to are the directions. They call for boiling water [Make sure to stir the bottom well, first time I didn't], then 1 minute 45 seconds (I do 1min 15, 1,45 boiled over once). In addition to this, it calls for 8 minutes wait time. In my situation it doesn't matter, I wait the time to see if it helps.

Now I'm stocked up for the Winter! Great lunch to grab on your way to work when its cold out.

review/summary: Tasty And Nutritious
review/text: This is a tasty meal and you get alot of food. Some people would consider it expensive,  but I disagree.  You are basically paying $2-$3 (depending on which store you go to) for a good meal. That's excellent. Some people may want to compare it to the price for something like Ramen noodles which only cost $ 0.70 a cup, but I say "where's the comparison?"  This is real, nutritious food!  Ramen noodles is just flour, fat and salt modified to look like food.  No comparison.  The fiber content is outrageous too! Half your days' fiber in a cup! That's the main reason I bought it.  I pair this product with a bottled water, yogurt and fruit and I have a filling meal on the go.  My suggestion is to use about a quarter to half of the flavor packet because that's where I figure most of the salt content is.  I did this and the soup still tasted great.

Require fully boiled water and at least let it sit for 2 minutes after a good stir so the water has mixed well with the powder.<br /><br />I am OK with the flavor but other members in my family do not like it. Seems to be quite healthy. I might buy it again in the future

It comes out with a good soup consistency for only a bit more on the price. But I haven't microwaved only added boiling water from the office coffee machine. So you'll have to try for yourself. Either way it's a good, all-natural product. Great soups in general from this brand, I just prefer the others.

review/text: As an American I spent my first 13 years in Rio, Brazil.  I grew up on black beans. The reviews enticed me to try this soup even though I have always made my own homemade black beans. I tried one of them and wasn't that impressed. The beans I found in it were shredded and not pleasing. The lime taste wasn't there, and I found it very spicy FOR ME.  I emphasize for me because others might like it that way.  I would like to mention that Brazilian food normally isn't spicy.  They usually serve a very hot sauce on the side that one can add to the food.

review/summary: Safer and Easier for Baby
review/text: I have been using this product since receiving the 2-oz bottles from the hospital. My baby took to it well and I did not want to switch formula brands any reason. I considered switching to the powder version of this product, but after trying it for one day, we saw the difference; my baby was suddenly very gassy and fussy, which is very unlike him. We decided to switch back to this product and I'm very glad that we did. This liquid formula was NOT affected by the Similac recall, so I felt more safe and relieved when hearing about it.<br />"No Abbott liquid infant formulas are impacted. Products not involved in the recall include all Abbott Nutrition liquid ready-to-feed and concentrated infant formulas and all powder and liquid specialty formulas".<br />Read more about the recall on the similac website and feel confident about the formula you choose to buy for your baby.

review/text: My son is 10 months now and has been on this formula since I stopped breastfeeding him when he was 4 months. We have never had any issues with this formula. He has never had an upset stomach or has ever been fussy while on this formula. When I stopped breastfeeding him he transitioned very well. Every baby is different and formulas work different on every one, that is why there is so many choices, but we got lucky with our first choice of formula. I did try to switch him to the powdered formula but he absolutely hated it. It was the same type just powdered so I don't really know why he didnt like it. It was ok though we just kept him on the premade liquid. Luckily we didnt start him on the powdered because there ended up being a recall so we got lucky there too.

The powder was fine, but this is much easier since it is premixed and I do not have to shake up a bottle in the middle of the night.<br /><br />I only gave it four stars because of the packaging, it can be a little messy to pour. It has a foil cap, and you invert the cap to cut the foil and pour the product. When I pour it tends to spill so I have a separate container I put the product in. Not a big deal, just a minor inconvenience.

review/text: My pediatrician recommended this formula to help my daughter gain some weight.  It seems to be helping.  We were breastfeeding before and when we went to the store to buy formula, we were SHOCKED at the cost.  I dont think we would be able to afford it without the Amazon Subscribe and Save discount.  It comes to my door every other week, so I dont have to worry about running out.  I am a huge Amazon fan for diapers, wipes, and formula!
