review/summary: THE BEST!
review/text: I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.

review/summary: Back to Boomer Childhood
review/text: Funny, seems to me that the cereal bits were so much bigger when I was a kid...<br /><br />It took a long time to try to explain this cereal to my kids, the heady days of Quake (sadly, no longer made) the introduction of Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Count Chocula (the only real survivor), and in the end I gave up trying.<br /><br />Man, I've got a bowl full of this stuff, sitting down in front of Boomerang to watch reruns of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6301249380">The Banana Splits</a>, and I'm in heaven, transported back to that magical early-70s time when the greatest thing in the world was the Friday-night double bill of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007V6IWQ">The Partridge Family</a> followed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGBSEY">The Brady Bunch</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICM5RG">Wonderful World of Disney</a>, and the greatest thing on Saturday morning was nonstop cartoons (until 1:00) and grabbing another Frito Bandito pencil eraser with my chips at lunch.<br /><br />For us 40-somethings, this is nostaligia food, and big thanks to Quaker for still making it.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with this gastronomic indulgence, you're looking at the exact same product as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0AJX0">Cap'n Crunch</a>, just pressed into a different form and in a different box.  This stuff stays cruncy a good long time in milk, and then finally settles down into that strange yet endearing sponginess before turning into a single mass of completely congealed cereal-mat--yummy!

review/text: As an avid collector of cereals from my past, that are still being produced today, I was delighted to find Quisp on Amazon. Quisp, in my opinion is the best! The cereal tastes great and the box with character art by Jay Ward is a delight to have on the table or anywhere in the house for that matter. I have a whole disply in my studio that I was lucky enough to procure from a local grocery store. I intend to continue buying quisp and saving the boxes till the disply is filled! For fathers day my boys will be serving me a big bowl and hopefully that quazy energy will last the whole day!

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: Made by Quaker cereal, Quisp tastes a bit like its sister brand, Cap'n Crunch. It is a sweet kids cereal, naturally in little saucer shapes. The back story was that the character Quisp had traveled for 15 years from his home planet to deliver Quisp to earthlings. For some reason Quaker employed an unusual advertising campaign that pitted two of their own brands against each other, Quisp versus Quake. The jaunty cartoon ads were created by Jay Ward and the Rocky and Bullwinkle team. As a kid I just loved the ads. Quaker has brought back Quisp for a limited time, and is selling it online as well as onsite in 6 cities in the USA. The offer gets you 3 regular size ceral boxes, and I found it tastes just like it did when I was a kid.

review/summary: A blast (of sugar) from the past.
review/text: Quisp is 3'1" tall, 43 pounds (on Earth) and hails from the Planet Q. Quisp, the cereal, was launched by Quaker Oats in 1965. The creation of animator Jay Ward (Rocky & Bullwinkle), Quisp and his nemesis Quake went head-to-head to determine which was spokesperson for the superior cereal brand. In 1970, Quisp won the battle. Quake went back underground (he was portrayed as a miner). Quake got a makeover, ditching his mining helmet for an Austrailian style brim and fronting the new cereal Quangaroos. Quisp eventually won that battle as well.<br /><br />Due to low sales, Quisp was discontinued several years later only to return in the 1990's as the "first internet cereal", being sold directly through Quaker's website. The brand has made it's way back to the shelves of some discount stores in the northeast, but for the majority of us it's still only available on the internet.<br /><br />As for the cereal itself, it's in the Cap'n Crunch vein of sugar, sugar and more sugar. Nothing spectacular. But if you want to relive your childhood, or give someone a gag gift for their 50th birthday, this may be just the ticket.

review/summary: Brussel's Ginkgo Bonsai
review/text: My ginkgo arrived via two-day air (even though I paid standard shipping). The tree did not drop any leaves, and does not show any signs of being "unhappy." The moss on the soil was still alive and very green, so moisture must have been maintained evenly in shipping. A+ for the shipping.<br /><br />My bonsai, like the review left before me, is a little larger than the description stated, but I don't mind. This ginkgo is just under 16" from soil to the top of the tallest branch, and a little taller if you measure from soil to the top of the tallest leaf.<br /><br />My only complaint is that my bonsai is not nearly as full as the bonsai pictured, and I will be posting a picture after this review goes up. It is still a beautiful plant, and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Will be coming back to Brussel's for my next bonsai.

review/summary: Angostura Lemon & Lime Bitters
review/text: The FIVE STARS are for the company alone.  Here's why:<br /><br />I was very surprised when I opened the package with the two bottles of lemon-lime "bitters". I thought this product would be like all other bottles of "bitters" where a dash or two would add flavor to a drink. Instead, these bottles are actually a bitter favored sparkling drink.<br /><br />I had requested a return from Amazon for this item.  Within hours I received a telephone call from Shoptropicks, a very polite call, in deed.  After explaining why I thought these bottles contained  lemon-lime bitters (similar to orange bitters, etc.), the gentleman from Shoptropicks suggested I still enjoy my purchase, yet he would issue a total refund, including shipping.<br /><br />No argument, no pressure, no adverse comments . . . . simply, "Enjoy the product and we are happy to make your refund". That's why I am giving this FIVE STARS. I am sure the sparkling beverage will be very satisfying, especially when I remember there are some nice businesses that treat their customers so well.

review/summary: Very good!
review/text: I admit it, I'm a tea snob. Tea isn't a beverage for me, it's an event, starting from boiling the water to when the last drop vanishes down my oesophagus.<br /><br />And as a snob, I don't buy bagged teas, I buy loose leaf. So I normally wouldn't have drank this tea, except that I filched a couple of complimentary bags while waiting interminably at the local dealership (OK, I drank one at the dealership and stole 3, one for each hour I was kept waiting).<br /><br />On the matter of taste, I find it very good. The Bigelow EG appeared to be very strong in color and taste.<br /><br />Tea bag teas are usually cut very fine so the tea bags can be packed flat, and because finely cut leaves have more surface area than big leaves, you don't need to steep the tea as long. In fact the instructions say to steep only 1-2 minutes as opposed to the usual 3-4 mins.<br /><br />To me, Earl Grey taste has two components, the tea taste and the bergamot taste, and it takes a lot of skill to blend and make a tea that has a pleasing combination of the two tastes.<br /><br />Taylors and Harrogate has a mild tea and bergamot taste. Whole Foods loose leaf has a strong bergamot taste. Your run of the mill EG usually has a strong tea taste that overshadows the bergamot and you don't taste it at all. Bigelow has a very strong tea taste, but it doesn't overwhelm the bergamot, which you taste at the end. So I like it very much, because I've never had a strong tea that didn't overwhelm the bergamot. And it's definitely not a mild tea, it's very robust and strong. It's not a light handshake, it's a full body hug and kisses on both cheeks when you drink this.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want a very strongly flavored Earl Grey with a strong tea taste, but also a strong hint of bergamot, this is it, I'll definitely buy some (because I think they have security cameras in the waiting area).

review/summary: Constantly good, mid-range price, Earl Grey
review/text: OK, for those of you having kittens about the four bags per foil packet, let me clear this up for you.  This is packaged for making *POTS* of tea.  I know my Mother-in-Law would find it excessive, but four teabags for a pot of tea is what it is expected to take for 4-6 cups of tea.  I, personally, like it for individual cups too because there is less waste, and bending over the top of the foil packet is very easy and keeps my tea perfectly fresh for three more days as I use up all the bags.<br />Now, for the actual review:<br />This had been my Morning Tea, every morning, for over a decade.  High-quality, expensive, tea companies (who really do know good tea) tend to not want to hide the wonderful flavor and aroma of their tea leaves with the bergamot flavoring Earl Grey is loved for.  They hardly add any bergamot, and while the tea is delicious, it is not really Earl Grey.  Cheap tea companies tend to overload their tea with flavorings to hide the fact that it is very poor quality tea.  Their Earl Grey is aromatic, but all you taste is bergamot (if you're lucky).<br />Bigelow has found a wonderful middle ground.  The bergamot is fragrant and flavorful but you still get to taste the tea, which is great for the grocery-store-friendly price.<br />If you want to sit by the fire and sip Earl Grey enjoying every bit of the moment, and you're willing to pay for that moment, then treat yourself to Rishi Tea Earl Grey Supreme (it's even organic).  If you want to guzzle it down for the caffeine fix then keep your budget happy and go for Stash.

review/summary: tea is good but labeling misleading
review/text: Bigelow tea in general is usually pretty good and the Earl Grey is a hit at the hotel I manager. For English however I prefer PG Tips but that's just my preference.<br /><br />I ordered this tea for the 97 room hotel I work at, to put in the rooms. 240 bags of tea at an awesome price! However, when I opened the tea up, we found that while yes, there is 240 bags, they are packaged 4 bags to a pouch. Maybe I overlooked this in the description somewhere. I checked again but did not see that anywhere.<br /><br />But now I know and hopefully this will help someone else. if you are looking for individually wrapped tea bags, do not get the 40 count box packs! Get the 20 count ones! (works out to be the same price)

Anyway, I like to heat up this tea in my microwave oven, and I say to it "Tea, Earl Grey, hot" and it's just like I'm talking to the replicator on the Enterprise! It even beeps! It's so cool. It makes me feel like I'm really in Star Trek. The only problem is that I can't talk as cool as Captain Picard so I sound kinda dumb when I say it. But I still do. When I buy this tea from the store, I like to ask the clerk to get me "Tea, Earl Grey, Bigelow". I think that's pretty funny. I make sure to use the English accent because if I didn't it wouldn't be right. Then I sit in front of the TV, and say "engage" as I press the button on my remote! I LOVE this tea!

review/text: I've been buying the 20-bag boxes of this tea from the grocery store for several months, long enough to know that I like it, and to make it worth my while buying it in bulk.  Every night I make enough to fill my thermos bottle (a bit more than 4 cups, I believe) in a tea pot using 3 bags.  These bags are a different style than the individually packaged bags, and they come packaged 4 in each envelope, but I can notice no difference in taste or quality from the individually packaged bags that I was buying before, so why not save money while I'm at it?<br /><br />Others have complained about the multi-bag packaging, but since I use 3 bags a day it doesn't bother me at all ... the envelopes are easy to fold over to keep the extra(s) fresh until tomorrow.<br /><br />If I have to complain about something, it would be how the strings are attached to the bags ... I use a pot that has a screen basket in the middle to hold the bags, so I don't want the strings in there as well ... I became accustomed to being able to yank the strings off the bags of the individually packaged bags, but doing the same thing with these bags tears the top of the bag (which isn't an issue for making the tea, just for cleaning the basket afterwards) ... so now I cut the strings off with a scissors ... a trivial thing, but I thought I would pass it along in case anyone cares.<br /><br />So ... if you like Bigelow Earl Grey ... and if you make your tea by the pot, or if you use more than 1 tea bag per day, then this is the way to go!

review/summary: Packaging is not in individual bags!
review/text: Be warned that this product does not individually wrap the tea bags but rather has them in groups of four. So there are ten foil packages each containing four bags, total 40 count per box. The foil package instructs to fold over the package for any remaining tea bags, but that is highly impractical as the foil package is too stiff for that. And often the package tears in such a way upon opening as to be useless afterward.<br /><br />Other Bigelow 20 count box tea that I've purchased do have individual packaging for each tea bag, so if that matters to you, choose the 20 count instead of this 40 count. The price is slightly higher, so there's a trade-off.<br /><br />The tea itself is quite a bit stronger than Twinnings. Its flavor is good, but I'm not convinced this is the best Earl Grey. But for the price, it's certainly a good option for Earl Grey drinkers.

review/summary: Do not be disappointed
review/text: I purchased these 240 bags of tea for my life partner, who is very fond of Earl Grey tea, actually we both are. This product is bland and little to no aroma. Seeping it longer does not help. I do not know what dust in a tea bag would taste like, but it's most likely close to this. The reason it is getting one star is his polite quote "At least the water was hot."

review/summary: Disliked packaging.
review/text: I bought this bulk packaging because it is a favorite blend that is used daily in the office. However, the description of "Pack of six 40-count boxes" was less descriptive than was useful. Upon opening one of the six boxes the internal foil packet had 4 tea bags in each and each tea bag was smaller than a "normal" tea bag. I had to use two to get the same strength as I usually do. The "savings" were not worth the hassle of dealing with open packets that needed to be stored, and doubling up on tea bags. I was disappointed because I love Bigelow teas. I will continue to buy Bigelow, but not in bulk.

review/summary: Best of the traditional Earl Grey's in my book
review/text: Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my favorite is Bigelow's.  I think its much better than Twinings, which tastes a little sour to me.  My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient.  However, I have to knock Revolution for trying to cut costs by not including a string with their tea bags.  If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo.  If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont.  I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception).  Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version.  Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves.

review/summary: Earl Grey - Excellent
review/text: I love tea, Earl Grey is one of my favorite.<br /><br />I tried Twinings, Stash (Double Bergamot Earl Grey), and this one - Bigelow.<br /><br />I found that Twinings quality varies from bag from bag, not just from box to box.  The good ones are very good, and the bad ones do not even smell the Bergamot.  The Stash Double Bergamot smells very good, but when drinking it, it's like drinking orange peel tea.<br /><br />The Bigelow Earl Grey has yet to show te variations among tea bags.  If you like Earl Grey, this one is highly recommended.

review/text: I normally drink Stash Earl Grey tea, but I thought I'd give Bigelow a shot since I love Constant Comment so much. I'm not sure if I'm just too accustomed to Stash (I usually buy the double bergamot flavor, so it's extra orangey, but the regular is almost just as orangey), but I just don't get enough of the bergamot flavor. I feel like the black tea flavor is overpowering the bergamot. It's pretty good, and I won't have any problem going through this box, but I'm sticking with Stash.

review/summary: Very good Earl Grey
review/text: I've always enjoyed a good, hot cup of Earl Grey tea. Maybe it's the bergamot flavoring. More likely it's because I'm a huge Star Trek fan and "tea, Earl Grey, hot" is Captain Picard's favorite beverage. Anyway, Bigelow's Earl Grey is one of my favorites. The tea itself has a nice, full-bodied flavor.<br /><br />Compared to other Earl Grey teas, I definitely like this one better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E199RA">Tazo's Earl Grey</a>. It's harder to compare to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7D1HK">Choice Organic Earl Grey Tea</a>. They have somewhat different flavors, but on the whole I like them both about equally.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, this particular item contains tea bags packaged in groups of four. It is designed more for brewing entire pots at once, but you can certainly use the bags one at a time as long as you have a place to store the partially used pack.

review/summary: Beware of the 4 tea bags per sealed envelope
review/text: I really like Bigelow Teas so when I saw the 40 count box size I thought that this was a real good deal. I did ask myself why was this box cheaper per bag than the 20 count box. I did not notice the very small description in the product description stating that there is 4 bags per envelope not 1 as in the 20 count box size. So now I know where the cheaper price comes from. If you drink 4 cups in two days or less this shouldn't be a problem. but if you only drink one cup per day then by the 4th day the last bag is starting to show some age because the envelope is open to the air.<br />I only wish I had noticed this sooner and I would have bought the 20 count size box instead.<br />Well, I guess I will just have to drink more tea so it wont go stale. Just maybe that is what the manufacturer had in mind in the first place :-)

review/summary: Way better than Wilton's!!!
review/text: These are the best candy coatings out there.  Most places only carry Wilton's which seems like such a monopoly and they are useless.  Merckens are so much smoother and easier to work with.  I wish they were widely available so I wouldn't have to order online.

review/summary: Yummy! Merckens super white coating
review/text: I bought these to cover the cake pops I made for gifts. When melting it was done easy in a microwave, stirring often to not allow it to become over heated.  Heated in the microwave and placed over hot water to keep melted while I was doing the dipping. I was very pleased with the coverage on the cake pops. Some white coating does not cover well over say a chocolate cake pop. So this was an easy product to use. I did think the price was a little high, but after using the product I was happy with the easy melting and coverage so decided it was worth the price.

They melted beautifully, smooth and glossy. I added some raspberry candy flavoring oil and my little cars turned out great. However, to my palate, they are a bit too sweet. Other than that, they are great candy coatings.

review/summary: Best Candy Melt to work with in my experience
review/text: I recently decided to jump on the bandwagon and give cake balls a whirl for a July 4th Party I was having. I had never even seen, much less heard of candy melts prior to this undertaking. Of course, where do I go first when looking for something? Amazon.com! Now...I live in Texas and it's H-O-T right now, so I was concerned about product "meltage" during shipping. I drove myself on over to Michael's and purchased a plethora of Wilton Candy Melts. Well, I couldn't help myself...based on the positive reviews of the Mercken's Candy coatings, I decided to go ahead and order some White (5 lbs)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008D6R92">5 LBS. Merckens White Coatings</a> and Blue (1 lb.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00085F7S2">1LB. Merckens Blue Coatings</a> Candy Coating. To my surprise, both arrived without melting...shocker! A few days later, I ordered Yellow Mercken's (1 lb.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008D6R9W">1LB. Merckens Yellow Coatings</a> and Paramount crystals <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012A2FVY">Paramont Crystals, 1 lb.</a>  , along with a couple other items. This shipment came and the candy melts had, well, melted! The Paramount Crystals were also a melted mess, but I figured since it was going to be liquified anyway...no harm no foul (or is it "fowl'?). I wasn't surprised by this...have you ever BEEN to Texas in late June? As my late Grandmother would say "It's as hot as Corn Liquor!" (not that she knew how hot that was, since she NEVER drank alcohol in her 94 years!) So, I will not remove a single star from my rating based on this product melting...after all, it is INTENDED to melt! ***take note those of you who remove stars based on issues irrelevant to the item itself, you know who you are, you're the people who rate a PRODUCT based things that don't speak to the product...such as shipping speed, poor customer service or other acts of God which have nothing to do with the actual worthiness of the product itself. Rant over.<br /><br />Okay...now that I got the "back-story" out of the way...the actual review! I set about making chocolate cake balls to make a r/w/b flag and some cheesecake balls, which were oh-so-yummy, but a big, fat, time-consuming pain, to put on a stick, coated and decorated with sprinkles. I also was going to be dipping pretzel rods and Oreos...a regular "dip-fest" as it were. Being one to experiment until I find the best/easiest method...I melted some white almond bark (I'd used almond bark in the past for white and choc dipped pretzels with good success), Wilton's Candy Melts, Ghirardelli White Chocolate (the bars for baking $$$$$), and finally the Mercken's Candy Melts. Of the 4, the Mercken's was the "winner" as far as ease of dipping, smooth consistency and taste. I hesitate to put taste in there, because it's so subjective and besides, they all tasted good to me. But, I do realize taste is an important consideration for most people. Really, the Ghirardelli had the best taste, but the cost and the difficulty in it "setting up" as nicely gave the edge to Mercken's for this project. The Mercken's did edge out the Wilton candy melts as far as MY taste buds go. Your mileage may vary. The Almond Bark was the least expensive, slightly more difficult to work with for this project, not real white, very yummy. Mercken's is available in many colors, is readily available (in Dallas), is less $ than Mercken's and certainly the Ghirardelli, but not quite a smooth and a tad more difficult to work with.<br /><br />Also, I was a tad skeptical that the Mercken's Super White Coatings would be so "super white", because the actual wafer didn't look too white to me.  To my surprise, I was pleased with how white it ended up once melted. I posted a photo of my cake ball flag, using the white and blue candy melts.  The red balls were made with the white melts with Wilton's Red Candy Food Coloring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FWVX">Wilton Primary Candy Color Set</a>. Hopefully, you can get an idea of the color and coverage. Of course, each computer monitor may show color differently.<br /><br />If you're particular, like I am, and the extra cost doesn't bother you, go with the Mercken's . If this is a project with and for the kiddos, the Wilton melts will be hunky dory. It's not that Mercken's are head and shoulders above Wilton's candy melts, just moderately so. Wilton's are certainly more widely available, cost less and come in more colors.<br /><br />Bottom line (for me) is that Mercken's was easiest to work with and that was/is the biggest factor in my preference. With the sprinkles and candy coating...all the desserts I was serving were so uber-RICH and sugary, I rightly figured the cake-pops and such wouldn't get eaten as much as they would be looked at for their decorating value and cuteness factor. My soiree hosted no kids...just a a house full of (thirsty) adults who were more focused on the offerings of adult beverages and jello shots than they were the desserts.<br /><br />***Note, I have pretty much the exact same review for the 5 lb. white, 1 lb. blue and 1 lb. yellow Mercken's Coatings, thanks to "Cut and Paste", to spare myself the trouble of re-writing the same review. Therefore, there is need to read my reviews for those items.

review/text: I absolutley LOVE this steak sauce. It is difficult to find stores who sell it. I only knew of 2 where I once lived and I have not found it in the city I now live. I do not use A1 sauce anymore. This steak sauce is full bodied and adds a sweetness that gives the savoriness of steak some depth. If you have not tried this sauce, I would definitely recommend it to any steak lovers out there. Just be warned that this sauce does add a sweetness to the meat rather than the tangy-savory taste that A1 usually provides.

I'm now going to order another 10 pounds; it's the same price as last time of $8.25 per pound, which is a very good price.  I only wish they were organic, but then again it would cost much more.

review/summary: Easier to digest than beef rawhide and dog just as happy!
review/text: I have a black Toy Poodle that has been chewing on beef rawhide bones practically since the day he was born.  However, his tummy always got a little upset from it and I heard the pork is easier for them to digest, so I switched to these Pork Chomps.  He loves them just as much (if not more) and now his tummy is more settled.  Plus, just like all-natural beef rawhides they do not stink or break into smaller pieces or discolor my blankets/sofa, like many other kinds of treats/bones .  They are odorless, they have no color and they stay in one piece until eaten in full.  Conclusion:  They ROCK!!!  My other "can't-do-without" dog supplement is called "Missing Link."  That product is A-MA-ZING as well and, along with a diet FREE of grain/flour/soy/sugar/preservatives, it has completely stopped him from scratching himself and knawing on his paws).

review/text: These moderately chewy (but not sticky) bars are not chock full of cranberries, but there are just enough to give some cranberry flavor. I love these bars as a quick breakfast - they are big enough to feel like a real meal. They are gently sweetened - not so sweet that I feel like I'm eating a candy bar, but sweet enough to be enjoyable - somehow they exactly matched the level of sweetness that I like in a "real" bowl of oatmeal. As for the other flavors ... my favorite flavor is coconut, and my least favorite is chocolate (and I love chocolate so that tells you something). I typically buy the coconut, strawberry, and cranberry bars.

review/text: I'm addicted to this coffee. The small boxes at the grocery store are expensive and I run out too quickly. It's great to be able to buy these in bulk through Amazon.

review/summary: #1 bagged tea as of today
review/text: When I discovered this tea at one of NYC coffee shops, I've decided: That's my tea. The tea is excellent! I even liked their Earl Gray, which I usually pass on. The packaging is a wholesale, but you are getting 100 bags at once and you pay less, than you would pay for retail boxes. The only seller 'Good As Gold Coffee' is really good, too.

review/summary: Good gift, but expensive
review/text: I received the old version of this as a gift (same set, different tea and the old perfect tea maker).<br />There is a few things here requiring review.<br /><br />Tea: The tea from Teavana is generally pretty tasty. They have some serious (high end) stuff, but mostly they have a lot of 'foofy' ones to try to get non-tea people to become 'tea people'. This is fine, and I actually enjoy a good bit of it as well. They are always changing the Tea provided with these sets, but generally you get a decent mate, a decent spiced roibos, and then either some foofy fruity ones or some black/earl grey. Overall as long as you're getting someone flavors they will enjoy the tea is great. [some of it has way too much fruity stuff for me, but I enjoy some of the simpler fruit ones with only a couple flavors].<br /><br />Tea spoon: actually, this tea spoon is a bit larger than a measuring tea spoon, but it is wonderful for tea. This is one thing I thoroughly miss when I make tea at work or somewhere besides my kitchen.<br /><br />Tea maker: the old one was good, but left a bit to be desired. I own the new one (in this set) now as well and it is really awesome. Very sturdy, good quality, easy to clean, you can read my review on it's product page.<br /><br />Sugar: the sugar is good quality, but generally a bad deal.<br />A note on Teavana's use of sugar: if you tried the tea at the store, it generally (not always) has a ton (4+ scoops) of this sugar or honey in it. They make it very sweet at the store so it tastes like juice and more people will buy it. If you're getting tea to avoid sugar/additives make sure you like it without the sugar. If you don't mind a ton of sugar, scoop away and this bag should last through most of the tea provided. (I personally like tea with a little or no sweetening so figuring out if I like a tea is difficult at the store...) I mention this because a lot of people I know like a tea at Teavana, buy it and complain that it doesn't taste good.<br /><br />The cans: the small cans are pretty awesome. I use their bigger cans for my regular tea supply, but I still use the small ones to take tea to work or on trips.<br /><br />Overall, I think the kit is a pretty bad deal since you get 4 of their cheaper teas (and can't pick) and the sugar (which you might not want). I was excited to receive this as a gift, though I didn't really enjoy all the tea in mine. I think if you wanted to get a tea lover a gift like this is would make more sense to buy the tea maker, the spoon, and a few teas they might like for about the same price. If this has everything you want, it is on par with Teavanas usual pricing.<br /><br />My opinion of Teavana is less than favorable, due to pricing, selling techniques,customer service and a handful of other reasons. However, their products are nice, and their tea (even the foofy stuff) is pretty good quality and a good way to introduce someone to tea.
