review/summary: Great way for my son to extra calcium
review/text: My toddler son loves these melts. They are a great way to get your child extra calcium if they aren't fond of drinking milk. They are a wonderful on the go snack for the times when feeding your child real yogurt is just way too messy.

review/summary: Great treat!
review/text: These are such a  wonderful alternative to the non-organic, sugar filled ones you find in your basic stores.  The melts are very tasty (I have tried them) but are not all the same size so for new solid food eaters you may need to watch which sizes they are given.  Have not tried the other flavors yet but plan to get them.  Wish they would sell a varity pack instead of having to buy 8 of one flavor.

review/summary: Great Treat!!
review/text: My baby loves these treats (as does the rest of the family).  The fact that they are organic and are sweetened with natural cane juice rather than added sugar like the name brand grocery store type makes them even better.  Even though you have to buy 8 at a time we just found someone to share the order with.<br />Have also tried the mixed berry flavor with equal favor.<br />Highly recommend!!

review/text: Pro:<br />1.  Organic<br />2.  Price in the pack is cheaper than the health food stores<br />3.  Tasty<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  Easy to eat too many, so need to watch the sugar level but good.<br />2.  Sizes are sometimes quite uneven, but not a big deal and pretty expected.<br />3.  Not a lot for the price, but this is the same buying elsewhere.<br /><br />Overall the cons aren't really cons, just wanted to make sure parents that haven't tried these were aware.  Buy these regularly, so not really negatives.

review/summary: Toddler loves them, but they are gone too soon for the cost
review/text: My son loves these things, but they go too fast. He pretty much eats half a bag at a time - and that ends up being quite expensive. I stopped buying them because of this. However, I would definitely consider getting them again for a roadtrip because they are dry, portable, and not messy even if dropped on the floor or seat. But for snacks at home, they are not worth the money.

review/summary: A Little Scary How Much The Kid Loves These
review/text: I am a first time mom, and our child had A LOT Of difficulties with solid foods and had an overactive gag reflex.  This food (and we do buy these in the set of 8)was and continues to be a lifesaver.  When nothing else would do, our baby LOVED these. I will say that they are on the expensive side compared to what you can get in the grocery stores and "big-baby-chain" stores.  We compared these to the GERBER yougurt melts and I believe there to be a noticible difference in quality/ taste, with these coming out on top. In the begining when she was just starting solids she would eat bunches of these on her own. They melt very quickly and for us, there was never a concern for choking (or puking with the overactive gag reflex).  Our baby is older now and can eat a lot more table foods, but we still mix these in with other puffs, cherrios, and small cereals for her to eat as a mix.<br /><br />I have purchased three orders of these from amazon (and enjoy amazon prime shipping)- so will likely purchase again, would recommend to a friend, and would buy (in smaller portions) as a gift for other moms to try out.

review/text: My daughter loves these yogurt melts.  She's been eating them since she was nine months old and is now 18 months old and still enjoys them as a snack.  For me, the sugar content is still a bit high so I try to limit the amount I give her.  These are great, no mess snacks when on the go, at the playground or at the beach.  I have to put a small amount in a separate container in my diaper bag because my daughter recognizes the packaging and would really like to eat the whole bag.

review/summary: Great Snack For Babies & Toddlers!
review/text: We have been buying these melts for about 7-8 months now for our daughter. They do tend to go fast, and since they are pricey we buy them sparingly and give them to her as a special treat. No funky ingredients in these that you cannot pronounce. I love how you know exactly what you are giving your child with these (and bonus, NO artificial colors/dyes!). I definitely recommend them as an addition to your diaper bag essentials. They keep my daughter busy when she is getting antsy while out running errands. Overall a great snack to have on hand for your little one(s)!

review/summary: My son's favorite snack!
review/text: These are my 2-year-old son's favorite snacks of all time. Having tasted them myself, I can see why! I like to make a toddler "trail mix" with them, using pretzels, puffs, etc; but he typically picks the yogurt melts out of the mix, eats them, and then asks for more melts, ignoring the other stuff. It's nice to have a snack option that offers the nutrition of yogurt without having the mess of regular yogurt, or the need for refrigeration. We don't do a ton of dairy in our household, so I like that, in addition to being delicious, this snack is a good calcium source.<br /><br />These are nice for younger babies too because, as the name implies, they melt in the mouth. I know there are other companies out there that make yogurt snacks, but I like that these are 100% organic, preservative-free, and have pre- and probiotics. Highly recommend.

I like how it's just organic yogurt, and how they're perfect for little fingers.  I only wished that they'd sell these in a variety pack for all the flavors.

review/text: My 2 young toddlers loved the Gerber yogurt melts, but it was getting too expensive to buy so many packs every week. I ended up trying these Happymelts, and thank goodness my daughters liked these too.  Personally when I tried them, I preferred the Gerber better as these were a little chalky, but since these are organic and cheaper on Amazon, I went this route. Love that this is yogurt that doesn't make a mess, doesn't require refrigeration, and is easy to transport. The girls love this when we're out and needing a snack.

review/text: I really like these. They melt in your mouth like astronaut ice cream and bring back fond memories of my childhood. Plus they're all organic and the entire bag only has 120 calories so you don't have to feel too bad about eating them all. The strawberry is definitely the best flavor. I've had the other two and they're okay but I don't think they're worth the high price.<br />I know Gerber makes their own version of these that I have seen at Safeway for only $3 each but I think they aren't organic. The only reason I would buy the Gerber ones is that they have strawberry, wildberry and peach flavors instead of strawberry, wildberry, and some sort of banana mango flavor. I don't remember exactly what the yellow flavor is...only that I disliked it.<br />AMMENDMENT TO REVIEW: The Gerber version is nowhere near as tasty as these ones. They are larger and chalkier and taste more artificial. If you are going to buy them online anyway, go for the good stuff.

review/text: My daughter was 12 months old before we gave her any food out of a package, everything up until that point was home cooked vegetables, fruit and grains.  From what I can tell, these are a "healthy" snack that she really enjoys.  They do taste delicious and are easy to take on the go.  Right now they are very helpful because chewing is uncomfortable with all her new molars; these melt in her mouth and satisfy her.  We will definitely buy more of these!

review/summary: tasty, but unpredictable sizes
review/text: I like these yogurt melts as a healthier alternative to those available in my grocery store, but I wish the sizes were a little more predictable. Some of the melts are tiny, while some are nearly an inch in diameter! I also agree with the reviewer who said they would like to see a variety pack instead of having to buy several packs of a single flavor.

review/summary: foul smell and taste
review/text: Let me start by saying my two little boys (1 and 2) like these, but I think it's because they don't know any better! These have a foul smell and taste. I don't know what is creating that odor and taste since these are not expired. I will not order these again. I don't know how some of the adult reviewers who are eating these can stand them. We buy happy baby greens puffs and love them. I have bought other happy baby items and thought they were great. These are a miss.

review/summary: Great but have to pick through the sizes
review/text: These are great and my baby loves them but I have to pick through the bag to give him right size.  Some are small and some just too big for my little guy.  I wish the company could come up with some kind of quality control.  The Gerber yogurt melts are very consistent but I prefer these because they have more vitamins than Gerber.

review/summary: My 9 month old daughter threw these up!
review/text: These should have an age limit. I do not think that breast fed babies under one should be allowed to eat these. Babies do not need probiotics at such a young age. My daughter ate about 5 of these and a couple of hours later projectile vomited all over the place! She does not spit up ever. I wished that I would have bought just one bag of these before I bought a whole lot of them!<br /><br />I think she will like them when she is a little older and used to eating other foods. She is mostly breast fed and eats some solids.

review/summary: Makes a good enchilada sauce!
review/text: I am not reviewing this as a soup because I'm not a tomato soup person, but it does make a good enchilada sauce! I do not like buying prepared sauce, because they usually come in little cans that just don't have enough product, and they are often made with ingredients that I don't want. A food blogger shared a recipe for a "two ingredient enchilada sauce" (would love to give you the link here, but I'm not allowed!) that called for a box of roasted pepper and tomato soup, and a can of green chiles, mix them in a blender until smooth and done! The first time I made this soup-based enchilada sauce I didn't have any green chiles, so I added a tablespoon of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F0JL7S">Bearitos Taco Seasoning, 1.4-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)</a> instead. That's how I make our enchilada sauces now and I will never go back to the canned stuff.

review/summary: warning, this product may cause sleep loss
review/text: Thanks a lot, Treat-Umms. Before we discovered your product, we used to sleep in, say, to 7:30 AM or so. Since we have been giving our 6 dogs (5 chihuahuas and a Japanese Chin) Chicken & Sweet Potato Wraps as a morning treat, they have trained us to get up at 5:30 every morning, or earlier, to get their little mouths wrapped around one of these wraps. They are relentless. And of course, being fairly intelligent and trainable, we have complied with their wishes completely. (BTW, one of our chi's has a liver condition, and these treats agree with him just fine.) This product is highly recommended (unless, of course, you value your sleep).<br /><br />Signed, Sleepless in A-town

I usually buy this kind of treat at our local discount shopping center, but I realized those dumbells were made in China, and that made me nervous after all the quality control problems China has had with pet foods and treats.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves These Treats!
review/text: My little 6 pound long haired chihuahua absolutely LOVES these treats!  She would eat five a day if she could, but I limit her to only one per day.  She gets very insistent on having one, so I usually break them in half and give her one half now and the other half later.  If you don't give her one on demand, she barks and then barks again and then barks again - a single bark each time - as she sits in the kitchen patiently waiting for her dumbbell - and won't accept any other kind of treat.  Her mind is fixated on these chicken dumbbells! When you do give it to her, she snatches it in her mouth and runs away like she has the King's ransom!

It takes just as good when brewed in a drip coffee maker as an espresso machine - though, I prefer the stronger taste of the espresso brew.  It's just as bold as Bustelo but a little smoother, and makes an excellent iced coffee in the summer.  As a tip, you can purchase all of the Bustelo brands from Javacabana.com for much cheaper than you can find anywhere else.

(I do this in two steps because I omit paprika and garlic powder on a couple of pieces for my Grandson) The combination is to die for. Spritz with EVOO, oven bake as you usually do for oven fried chicken. While the chicken bakes, put 4 T. coconut oil on a cookie sheet and place on empty, lower rack in oven. Slice 5 washed yams in 1/4 inch diagonal slices. Remove the warm cookie sheet and toss yams in melted coconut oil. Return yams to oven. Yams will be done about the same time as chicken...but check so they don't become mushy. You will love this chicken, if you love cinnamon, and the yams are better than candy. Hope it makes your day.

review/summary: For the Cinnamon-Lover
review/text: There is a whole lot of cinnamon in this cereal (i.e. a lot of cinnamon left in the milk dregs), and I love it! I think it tastes like gingerbread, but I could be wrong. There is no ginger, but it reminds me of some kind of Christmas cookie in America. I have not purchased this cereal from Amazon so I can't talk about Amazon's quality or packaging/shipping, but the cereal itself is very good. It's the regular Heart-to-Heart cereal, but with an upgrade of sorts.

review/summary: Great Breakfast That Doesn't Tire
review/text: My wife and I both have this cereal almost every morning, and we've been doing so for a while. The flavor isn't overwhelmingly sweet or cinnamon-y, making it a lasting staple in our kitchen for an easy breakfast; what's more, it doesn't get old. The four pack lasts us about a month, maybe  a little less. We'd recommend trying it out and then if you like it, subscribe and save. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007A43NMG">Kashi Heart To Heart Honey Toasted Oat Cereal, 12.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> Isn't bad either, if you want to give it a try.

review/summary: Delicious Tea
review/text: This is my favorite tea. Very strong Bergamot aroma, and the tea is very fresh (I just drank a cup this morning from a bag I bought in January and it's not stale yet!). The silk bags allow really fast and thorough steeping. Shipping was super quick, and I love that the sachets are all in a single, resealable bag, rather than individually packaged. Less packaging=less to throw away. These are 2-cup sachets, but I use them in regular mugs, just being sure to only steep it for a few minutes. Sometimes I get a second cup out of a sachet if I save it (I'm not a purist, I just like tea!), but if you have a 2-cup teapot these are perfect for that, too.<br /><br />I bought the 50-pack in January and I need to buy another one real soon.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just bought another pack, plus one of the Chocolate Mint, and it's just as high quality as the last. Definitely recommend this tea and seller.

review/summary: Even better than FiberOne
review/text: A few years ago, I stumbled upon FiberOne products and simply spent all my free time annoying my friends and co-workers by talking non-stop about it. My friends joked that I should be the spokesperson. Well, fast forward a few years, and amazingly I've found a product that supplants FiberOne in my heart. FiberPlus has antioxidants that FiberOne doesn't have, but that's not why I like it better. I like it better because it generally just tastes better. FiberOne tastes fine (especially the raisin bran), but I still feel I am eating a "health cereal." This FiberPlus cereal tastes straight up delicious, regardless of its health benefits. I would be tempted to eat it even if it had the nutritional profile of Count Chocula. But of course, it's just as healthy as FiberOne.<br /><br />Keep in mind, these are just my tastes. The yogurt balls that are included in this cereal are things I really enjoy, but others may not. But in general, the total taste is superior.

review/text: This stuff I found at my sister's place. I tried it and loved it. It made me think of raisin branne [sic] with yogurt. Why don't those guys make that? Or berry bran? Or banana bran? Diversify Brainiacs!<br /><br />Be very very careful. Don't ignore the verbiage on the front that says it has lots of fiber. I am a dude. I don't know or care what the hell that gibberish is supposed to mean.<br /><br />But I learned if you do 2-3 bowls of this awesome tasting stuff, it better be your day off of work. Or else you WILL be racing home from work for the duration of the whole day.<br /><br />It shoots the plumbing with a quickness. Recall or google Pope of Greenwich Village. When Paulie slips the cop a Mickie.<br /><br />I love the flavor and the healthy parts, but I only do 1, that is ONE bowl each day or couple days MAX.<br /><br />Be Smart.

review/text: One of the best cereals I've ever tasted. I'm not a big cereal eater, but I can have 2 bowls of this in one sitting. Personally, I can't eat the same flavor over and over again, so that's why most cereals are a no-go for me. But in FiberPlus Berry Yogurt Crunch, that's not the case. The granola clusters and yogurt balls make it interesting.<br /><br />Buying the 3-pack of this cereal comes in really handy, as my husband and I both eat a lot of it, and we save a lot of money by doing it this way.

This is healthy for you (granted it does have a decent amount of sugar in it) and tasty.  The little clusters are such nice surprises.  I eat this about 3 times a week and have not gotten sick of it yet.  Amazon's price is a great deal...cheaper than the stores.  And the stores hardly ever have them on sale.
