review/summary: Cat Candy
review/text: If you buy one tin, buy ten because your cat will think these are wildly delicious. Strangely enough they are shaped like fish, but they contain ingredients like green tea extract and rosemary oil.<br /><br />We went through one tin in a week and my cats thought these were the best treats they had ever tasted.<br /><br />I had no idea cats would enjoy rosemary oil in a cat treat, nor did I think they would paw at the empty tin begging for me to buy more. Definitely a treat to hide in a safe place.<br /><br />Even after taking these out of the packaging and box, my cats were clawing at the box to get more. You have to hide the box<br />in a high place or in a drawer or they will find a way to get into the container. lol<br /><br />I'm not sure who enjoys these treats more. I love<br />seeing how much my two cats enjoy these treats. The<br />tin with two treats can also work as a training tool<br />because the cats will instantly respond when they<br />hear the treats being shaken in the tin.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: We have a very difficult cat when it comes to eating and treats.<br /><br />We bought the pink boxes of Pitr' Pats in a pet store in Belgium. Of all the treats we bought, he only liked those. Then one day the pet store stopped selling them :-s<br /><br />We seeked the internet to find them, so now we order them from oversees. Yup, we pay only about $3 for the treats and $20 for the transport, but seeing how much he adores them makes it worth the money.

If you forget or are late they will first sit in front of the cupboard where we keep them. If that does not do the trick they will come to you and let you know with many meows and lead you to the cupboard! our Siamese boys can be loud if they want to get your attention.

review/summary: Does what it is supposed to do
review/text: I am a working mother and have been pumping milk for my daughter for over 6 months. I have gotten busier and busier and became concerned when my milk began to taper. I use these supplements every time I start to see a lull in my milk supply. I usually take one a day at night and use them during the day if I plan on pumping regularly.<br /><br />I do not take a whole lot of it, just enough to keep myself pumping between 10 and 13 oz per day. It has worked wonders for me. I only wish I had this after my son was born. My milk dried up really quickly when he was around 8 months and he had to drink frozen for the remainder of his first year. Luckily, my daughter will have much more milk due to this product. I would recommend it.

review/text: I started taking this when my baby was about 10 months.  I have been trying to make it to one year nursing.  I didn't see a great increase, maybe a little.  It certainly didn't hurt anything to try it.  I have now stopped taking it and didn't see any difference when I stopped either.  I think it's something to try if you are really wanting to continue nursing and see a decrease in your production.

review/summary: Fenugreek
review/text: To be honest, I was hoping for the results that some women that reviewed these pills had.  I think that I had some milk increase, but nothing like what I had read on most of the reviews.  I tried pumping every two hours after returning to work and would be lucky if I pumped 2-2.5oz total from both breasts. I thought that meant that I had a milk supply problem, so I started taking Fenugreek.  When I first started taking the pills I was only taking two, twice a day.  That seemed to help a little and the morning pump I was pumping about 4oz each breast.  I slowly increased the amount of pills I was taking but it didn't seem to increase my milk supply.  I pump twice a day now and get anywhere from 10-12oz total for the day...that might get my baby through one day at day care.<br /><br />I think that this just works differently for different people.  I did notice that when I sweat I smelled like maple syrup, but that has since decreased and I don't notice it anymore.  I might have become more gassy, but it never affected my baby in a negative way...she has always remained a happy baby whether I'm taking it or not.  I'm still taking the pills a few times a day and just pump twice a day for whatever I can get.  I have started supplementing my baby (now almost 5 months) to start weaning.<br /><br />I would recommend Fenugreek if you think that your milk supply is low and you need a boost...it doesn't seem to hurt to try it.  I wished that I would have gotten what other women got, pumping 8-10oz per breast every pump...but alas I wasn't that lucky!

review/text: I pump then bottle feed my baby the breast milk. I began taking this as directed (2 pills/3x a day) and was able to pump about 2-3oz of milk each time (I pumped every 3 hours) on each side. When I noticed my baby started needing more I began taking 3 pills/3x a day and now get about 3-4oz each time I pump (still every 3 hours) on each side. I gave it 3 stars because my hope is I won't have to keep increasing the dosage just to pump more. Anyway it seems to be working out OK so far. Hope this review helps!

review/summary: helpful for breastfeeding
review/text: I wanted to breastfeed my son as long as possible, but I felt my supply was diminishing after only three months, and several sources pointed me to try fenugreek capsules. I ordered them, and before I received them I was supplementing one feeding a day with formula. After I started taking them, I noticed that I was able to pump more and my son seemed less hungry. (The one catch to this is that I was also drinking more fluids and pumping frequently also to help increase my supply, so I'm not 100% sure that it was because of the fenugreek, but there was a definite correlation there.) They taste kind of funny, sort of like maple syrup, and gel capsules are a little weird, but well worth it for the health and financial benefits of exclusive breastfeeding.

At first I didn't have any problem (got ~4 oz. each time), but my milk supply began to decrease when my baby was about two months old so I searched on the internet and found this Fenugreek, but it took me a few weeks to decide to buy it (I tried to eat/drink more, but it didn't help). I take two pills three times a day and saw a slight change on my milk supply on the second day. It took about a week for me to really see a different. Now I get about 4-5 oz. each pump. Works great! I just wish I bought it a week sooner so my baby didn't have to take formula.

I fed her directly from my breast (thinking maybe she just didnt want a bottle's nipple) and she ate a little more and fell asleep but then when she woke she screamed for hours as though she were in pain, curled up, turned red, wouldnt sleep for longer than ten minutes and it took me half a day to realize the only thing I had done different was take four of the capsules. I actually LIKED the maple syrup smell but she looked like she was in so much pain I just CANNOT give this a full five stars. There should be something on the label that warns or more reviews about it.

review/text: Who cares if you smell like maple syrup?! There are worse things you could be accused of smelling like!  It brought my milk supply up safely, so I'll take it!<br /><br />Beware the prescription galactogogues.  They worked for me, but had some side effects for me and baby, and can have some long-term neurological side effects if taken continuously.  I found when I stopped taking reglan, my milk supply dropped off again.  No way was I taking it again after the tummy aches my baby had the first time, and certainly wouldn't take it continuously for the next several months until I reach my goal of one year.  So I started taking fenugreek.  It does the trick and I feel safe continuing it as long as needed.  And I think I am the only one who can smell the maple syrup (anyway, I am the only one sticking my nose in my armpits).  Don't worry about it!

review/summary: Works (but not miracles...)
review/text: I noticed an increase of milk production after a week of taking this supplement.  I take four capsules three times a day along with blessed thistle (3 capsules, 3 times a day).  Previously, I pumped four times a day and got 12 ounces in total; now I get about 15 ounces.  The maple syrup smell is not overwhelming but it is easy to feel a bit light-headed and nauseous from the effects on your blood sugar levels so I make sure to take my supplements after a meal.  I also notice that the more water I drink and the healthier I eat during the day, the more milk I yield in general.  Despite the good and the bad, I will continue my pill-popping regiment because every ounce of milk for my baby is precious.

review/summary: THANK GOD FOR FENUGREEK!
review/text: I was adament about breast feeding my baby. Everything was fine while I was at home, I had no problems breast feeding. But when I had to go back to work, I wasn't getting much through pumping. I made sure to drink plenty of water and ate enough fruits and veggies. But I guess some women don't produce a whole lot. I tried the Mother's Milk Tea first before ordering the herbs. I took if for a week and didn't notice a thing. I was depressed bc I didn't want to supplement but the demand was more than the supply!! I ordered the Fenugreek and the Blessed Thistle. I read other reviews saying to take both so I thought, mindaswell. After 1 day I was producing more! Before I would pump and get 1oz. from one side and maybe nothing from the other. Now, I get 3-4oz. from each side per sitting(pumping) And while at work I try to pump every 2 hours. It's hard bc I am a hairstylist and usually very busy. But I could care less what anyone says! I have to feed my child, so I go in the back and pump. I do take 2 of each pill 3 times a day. I do have to get up in the middle of the night and pump to relieve myself. I'd say if you don't want to have to do that, skip the 3rd dose! But my son usually gets up once anyways to eat so I just pump what I can. Hope this helps!!! It helped me so much. :)

review/text: I am 40 and just had my son 5 months ago.  Started having trouble with my milk supply around the 5 or 6 week mark - due to a few different issues.  Didn't discover this until a few weeks after than and took 2 pills three times a day and drank lots of water.  It immediately increased my supply.  Over time, however, my supply has decreased again even with continued use (went back to work so I am no longer able to breastfeed/pump every 4 hours - only every 6-8 now).  I must admit that I think the Fenugreek is the only reason I am even pumping the 12-16 ounces a day that I get now.  I am now going to try combining the Fenugreek with Blessed Thistle as some other users have posted about.  Hopeful it will increase my supply again.

review/text: I got these because I have heard about them from a lot of breastfeeding Moms. I used them for a month and noticed a very tiny increase in my supply, but for the entire month my baby pooped 6-8 times a day. She was fussy and always blowing out her diapers. I didn't make the connection at first and then decided to stop taking them, after a day she went back to pooping normally and wasn't as fussy.<br />I was taking 2 capsules, 3 times a day. I barely noticed an increase in supply and it made my daughter very gassy and uncomfortable. I was really hoping this would help but it just didn't work for me.

review/summary: Have noticed an increase.
review/text: Fenugreek works for some moms and doesn't for others. I find it utterly amusing that women talk about smelling like maple syrup while taking the supplement!! I haven't noticed that - either I'm used to it or my husband is too nice to tell me, or he has noticed and likes it! I was making just enough to feed my little one, and now I regularly pump 1-2 ounces AFTER he eats AND I pump in between feedings and get an ounce or so.. That doesn't sound like a lot but it adds up and I've started quite the nice freezer stash. I'm not honestly sure if it was the fenugreek that has done it or if my body just started producing more because my diet is great and I stay hydrated.. But since fenugreek is a hell of a lot cheaper than the Motherlove products and not as annoying with the restrictions about drinking around taking the pills, I'm just gonna keep taking them!<br />Also, I have had no problems with gassiness in baby.

review/summary: Great help when needed!
review/text: I did some researching on how to increase my milk production and after reading several of the promising reviews for this Fenugreek, I thought I'd give it a try since it was so affordable. I am a very skeptical person, and was very surprised when I did notice more milk after just the first 2 days. I at first took the recommended 2 capsules 3 times a day. My daughter who was almost 3 months old, didn't seem to be affected by it and I seemed to be able to keep up production. I stopped taking them after about a week. Then when I would notice my milk going back down or my daughter seeming more hungry than usual, I popped 3 capsules just a little while before needing more supply and saw that it helped to do that just once a day. It has been wonderful that I can stop taking it and then take it when needed and know that it will work. I did notice the maple smell in my sweat and urine though, but that's something I can deal with knowing I'm able to feed my daughter without having to supplement with formula. Never noticed any other side effects. Now I just take them every few days as needed. Definitely worth trying if you are feeling the urge to supplement or give up breastfeeding altogether because of low production or just can't keep up with baby. Now if they can just come up with something to make both breasts produce equally!!

I have not gone back to using the fenugreek because I now have more milk than when I was taking the fenugreek. Hence, I am not sure whether this helps or not, but I would not discourage people from using it since many of my friends have used it with successful.

review/summary: Definitely Happy
review/text: I'm a guy and as most guys, I appreciate bigger boobs. My girlfriend, who I have been dating since high school for a little over 4 years now, was a little unhappy in that department and wanted a little change. Before considering surgery, we decided to give some natural methods a try. After doing some research, we narrowed down some of the most commonly found ingredients in those super expensive pills and began to look for them on amazon.com. Since she had tried some breast enhancement pills before, which didn't work, we decided that she would be better off using only the herbs and stuff that was medically proven to work and give results. Here is what we picked out.....<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VOJ7S0">Ainterol Pueraria Mirifica 500Pure Breast Capsules (100 caps)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024D9AW">Wild Yam Root 180 vcaps</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ETA6W">Nature's Way Fenugreek Seed 610 mg, Capsules 180ea</a><br />These are the ingredients that we sort of liked and decided to give them all a try. So I guess this review is for all three of them at the same time. She has been taking them for just over two months now and we both agree that we have seen a change. Her bust has grown by a little over two inches and her breasts definately fell and have more fullness to them. She is a lot more confident and says that her shirts sit on her much nicer. Now she has an extra excuse to spend a ton of money shopping for new clothes, but what can I say, I just love her. A little bit of caution, there are a couple of changes that happened after she started to take the combination of all three of those pills. Her natural body smell has changed a little, nothing negative of course or she would have stopped taking them, but it has altered just a little. And she sometimes complains that her boobs are a little sore. But there has been a significant size difference and I believe that this stuff works. Good luck to you ladies and guys remember to love your women, they're just as sensitive about their boobs as we are about our penises!

review/summary: Worked well for us!
review/text: I read many diverse reviews for this product, but I believe it only works if you use it properly. I learned that it not only about taking a pill, you got to make sure you eat extra food and drink extra liquids. Also timely pumping or breastfeeding is very important too. I noticed, as soon I'd start extracting or taking pills at different times, milk amounts would start messing up. So I started pumping 4 times a day, every 6 hours, day or night, and it became stable and enough for a baby. It is truth that pills give a gas, not only baby, but I was gassy too, but I started taking smaller dose than written on package, 4 pills a day- every time I'd pump. Supply was still good, but a baby wasn't as gassy. Later on as she got bigger, it was unnoticeable, rather I'd say it was due to a food (pickles, cabbage, etc). Most importantly, I believe breast feeding was more valuable over gas issue. I've met so many women who were just too lazy to give their babies what is best for them.

review/summary: Fenugreek + other doctor-prescribed tips to increase milk supply
review/text: I had to get medical therapy to increase my milk supply for twins. Fenugreek was prescribed and it made a huge difference. Based on what the doctor told me you can try the following if you have twins or simply need to increase your milk supply:<br /><br />* Fenugreek is very helpful, 2 capsules three times a day with meals, eventually working your way up to 4 capsules per meal. The body gets used to it after a while so the doctor suggested going off it for a couple of days and restarting.<br /><br />* Nurse 8-12x a day, putting each baby to breast until they empty it (do not time it) - the baby is much more effective than the pump at drawing the milk out than even a hospital pump, and will help increase your supply. In effect, interrupting the feeding could be counterproductive.<br /><br />* You can decrease the # of sessions if the amount pumped is more than 1000 ml/ 24 hrs (try pumping instead of nursing for one day to measure). You can also try weighing the baby to calculate intake, using a baby scale in grams (same as mls for calculating). Note - this will be a rough estimate as the baby may be getting more milk than the pump - and some women are unable to pump much even if they can nurse well.<br /><br />* Alternate sides for the babies, as one may have a stronger suck. It's possible one side will have a lot more milk than another. How you hold the baby also affects supply - if you're right handed that side will hold the baby more firmly and they may nurse longer and increase supply more on that side. All normal.<br /><br />* After breastfeeding the baby, pump but only for 5 minutes or so to increase demand on your body and thus milk production. Frequency is much more important than duration. Pumping for 20 min has little effect according to the doctor (I know, "now I find out?!" that's what I said)<br /><br />* If you have twins, read the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976896931">Mothering Multiples: Breastfeeding and Caring for Twins or More! (La Leche League International Book)</a> by Karen Kerkhoff Gromada. I wish I had read this early on. It provides solid advice on breastfeeding multiples plus a whole lot more up to 2 yrs of age.<br /><br />* Try to eat well and sleep at least 6 hrs. Your milk production is directly related to your health and stress levels.<br /><br />* If you're able to breastfeed exclusively great but if you can't don't beat yourself up over it it's Ok to supplement (we used Enfacare as my babies were low weight, then Enfamil Premium for one and Alimentum for our other). You have a lot on your hands to worry about.<br /><br />* Don't try to do all feedings alone, you'll go crazy. Have your hubby do the last feeding of the night 10 or 11 pm and the early morning one (6 or 7 am) - you do the ones in between. This way, you'll each get a solid chunk of sleep. The one who's not "on shift" stays in the quiet bedroom without a monitor but with a cell phone. We had an extra bed in the nursery so it would be easier to nurse the babies - if I needed help (two babies crying at the same time or you're too tired) I'd call my hubby on the cell phone, but this rarely happens if you stage feedings (always feed twin A first for example). My hubby comes in at 6 am or whenever and quietly feeds the babies before they wake up so I can sleep until 8 or so.<br /><br />* I kept my energy and supply up with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQDDYE">Ensure Plus - Vanilla</a> and oatmeal.<br /><br />* Google "manual expression Stanford University", the video shows how to increase your milk supply significantly using manual expression. It works better than any other method even if it feels unusual.<br /><br />* If you do supplement and trying to increase breastfeeding, don't stop bottle feeding cold turkey (you may not have enough milk supply as supplementing may lower supply). Continue to supplement and give 1 oz or so BEFORE starting to nurse. The reason for this is that bottlefed babies are used to a faster flow and ready supply, with nursing it takes longer for the milk to let down. Giving the bottle-fed baby some formula before nursing will take the edge off his hunger and keep him from "chomping away at the bit" if you will - in other words it will calm him down and make the nursing experience more relaxing for mom & baby and allow baby to nurse longer.<br /><br />* Try a brief warm shower or use warm compresses (try putting warm water in a diaper) before nursing to stimulate milk let down.<br /><br />* Keep your eyes off the clock. Another reason to not interrupt or time breast feeding - the hind milk that lets down after the baby has been nursing a while is richer and higher in fat, more satisfying for the baby. If you stop after "X" minutes you may not get the hind milk.<br /><br />* Continue nursing 8-12x a day - don't wait too long before feedings (4+ hrs), any sign of engorgement is letting your body know there's less demand and will reduce milk production. Nursing every 2-3 hours is better, allow a stretch of 4 hours early in your sleeping cycle to feel better rested (have your hubby feed baby late at night).<br /><br />* Pump for a few minutes each time you nurse to simulate increased demand and boost milk production. Manual milk expression and fenugreek will also help and over time you'll need to supplement less as your milk production increases.<br /><br />* Don't do marathon pumping. As soon as you start feeling stressed or find yourself wondering how many ounces you've pumping, etc. you're overthinking things and this will affect your milk supply. Stop for a few minutes and go do something else. Then pump a little more. You can leave it out at room temperature while you do this - mark the time you started & date on tape w/ a Sharpie pen to be safe. If you wait 15-30 min or so, it counts as an additional pumping session (if you're trying to fit more in).<br /><br />* Pumping is not always a good indicator of your real milk supply (some women may not be able to pump much but nurse well) - a baby scale is the most accurate measurement if you really want to know (don't stress this too much, just nurse until baby seems full).<br /><br />* Feed on demand and expect cluster feeding (every 1-2 hrs) at the witching hour and just before a growth spurt.<br /><br />* For me at least I always had to supplement with twins because I never had enough milk for two. I did see a huge increase in my milk supply from very little to being able to nurse one baby full time for a while. Fenugreek was a HUGE help.<br /><br />Lastly, this tip from a sleep doctor - to handle sleep deprivation log how many hours total you slept at night (even if interrupted), find the midway point and add 12 hours. Try to take a 30-60 minute nap then, this is your natural down-time according to your inner clock and will be much better than trying to catch up on sleep on the weekends (example - slept 12am -6 am, midway point is 3 am add 12 hrs - try to nap @ 3 pm.) Keep a log of how long you sleep each time - always try to get at least 6 hrs.<br /><br />With Fenugreek, enough sleep, a good diet and the tips above, your milk supply should increase.

review/summary: Excellent resource for increasing your milk supply
review/text: My milk supply began to decrease significantly after I started back to work (my son was about six month's old at this time). I took -- and still take, 3 tablets of fenugreek and blessed thistle each per day at least twice a day. If I am not able to pump, I add another round of the herbs and let my son nurse more, to keep my milk supply going strong. This is a wonderful blessing to know that my milk supply can easily be reestablished, if stress, schedule or other factors inhibit our desire to feed the old fashion way! Five stars for fenugreek (and blessed thistle, too!) As a side note, the lactation nurses have told me, that these herbs do lower your blood sugar, so they should be taken with food. I say that from experience. All in all, it more than met my expectations.

review/text: I was taking Fenugreek along with Alfalfa and mothers milk tea for months to increase my supply and I the combo had. Then my baby became very gassy and making our lives miserable. I suspected everything from my food to the supplements. I tried cutting different foods then reintroducing them and no change. Finally I decidedvto read up in the supplements and found that in 20% of babies Fenugreek causes gas and/or fussiness.<br /><br />So the next day I stopped taking it. Now 1 week has passed and not only has my baby's gassiness gone away I oddly feel that I have more milk.<br /><br />I'm sure this works for some so can't say it's bad. Just be aware that this can happen.

review/text: I had to decrease my baby's feedings when I had to return to work 8 weeks postpartum. Eventually, my hectic schedule and numerous illnesses made me stop. My son is now 3 months and I have been feeling incredibly guilty about stopping, so I'm attempting to relactate. I only had about 2 drops of milk from each side, but after almost a week of Fenugreek (9 pills a day), I'm noticing more droplets and an occasional squirt. I find that incredibly impressive. Without this, and my pump, I would have given up and felt guilty for the rest of my life.

review/summary: Helps to boost male libido
review/text: Fenugreek has been so typecast as a way to facilitate lactation that most guys would never dare to think of it for themselves--much less actually try it. The fact that it contains phyto-estrogens just complicates things further if you're concerned about testosterone levels. But sometimes things that look a bit crazy seem to work out well in unexpected ways.<br /><br />I started using fenugreek a year ago, discontinued it because of the testosterone concerns, and recently restarted it to help moderate anxiety symptoms from a choline-related medication I had just started. Since fenugreek's action appears analogous in many ways to oxytocin (a hormone closely related to empathy and the mitigation of fear/anxiety responses), I thought it might help to defuse these reactions. It was at least worth a shot.<br /><br />It does seem to have helped with the anxiety reactions (I combined it with l-glutamine for those who are really interested). What surprised me completely was the very strong boost in libido that I experienced inside of three days. And when I went back and doublechecked the research on fenugreek, I found that a mid-2011 report by Australian researchers showed a 25 percent increase in male libido for those using fenugreek. So objective research says this effect of fenugreek is real. Subjectively, I know that this supplement is way more effective for me than things like saw palmetto that are commonly marketed for libido boosts.<br /><br />And I wasn't even looking for this effect. But it works, and this is one of those side-effects that's a keeper. Beyond this, fenugreek is commonly used around the world by both sexes to help with type 2 diabetes. It appears to help with blood-sugar levels, but I can't say definitively that it works. It's inexpensive enough to be worth trying.<br /><br />My hoped-for long-term use for fenugreek is actually to help with what Buddhists call metta meditation, that is, focusing on lovingkindness. Research by the Center for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin suggests that expert meditators on lovingkindness modulate the functioning of the amygdala, a component of the brain that helps to establish empathic reactions and, once again, is closely associated with oxytocin. My experience so far is that fenugreek does in fact help with empathy. This makes eminent sense. Lactation and mother-child bonding pretty much go hand in hand.<br /><br />If you're interested in the underlying neurophysiology, you can probably do a much better job than me in researching this. If you're just a guy who could use a shot in the arm for lovemaking, then this is a worthwhile supplement even if we can't figure out all the physiology involved. Even if none of the above effects interests you, fenugreek is used for and may help with many other things, such as digestion (see Wikipedia for more information on such uses).<br /><br />I hope some of this proves helpful.

review/summary: It got my milk flowing.
review/text: I wanted to switch my baby to formula, but it gave her gastrointestinal problems. I then decided to switch back to breastfeeding. I had only stopped for about a week, but my milk supply had significantly decreased. I was producing about 2 oz every 3 hours. (My baby has a cleft palate so I exclusively pump. Because of this I am aware of exactly how much milk I am producing.) I ordered the Fenugreek (which arrived surprisingly fast)and started taking it immediately. The bottle suggests taking 1-2 pills 3x a day with food. I started off with that dosage while increasing my pumping sessions. I did not notice a huge difference at first. I read on other message boards that most women take 3 pills 3x a day. I increased my dosage. After about a week of Fenugreek at the higher dosage plus an increase in pumpings, I noticed a huge difference. I would get approx 6oz every 3 hours. My first pump in the morning around 5am I normally get about 10oz! My freezer is now full of milk and my supply has stayed consistent. I now pump for 20 min every 4-5 hours, with an 8 hour break at night. My milk supply has not diminished and I am confident it is the Fenugreek.<br /><br />I have not had any negative reactions or experienced any maple smell that some women have mentioned. I have not experienced any side of that can be attributed to Fenugreek. The only downside is that since I take 9 pills a day the bottle doesn't seem to last very long. However, Fenugreek is super cheap so buying more isn't really an issue for me.

review/summary: Worth a Try.
review/text: Our baby was born in early October. My wife wanted to feed him the way nature intended and we were visited by a lactation nurse at the hospital. She advised us and said that if we ever had problems with obtaining enough milk, we might try Fenugreek, a supplement available at health-food stores. Of course, we forgot the peculiar name shortly thereafter. Well, my wife started to have difficulties a few weeks later in keeping up with the baby's growing needs.  We mentioned the problem to a young couple who had a recent child. The woman said she had the same problem and told us to get Fenugreek. She said it had worked for her. There was that strange-sounding word again.<br /><br />We purchased Nature's Way Fenugreek shortly thereafter. Strange stuff. It's an herbal supplement in capsule form, but the label doesn't say what it's for. I guess you just have to know. Evidently, it's one of those things that takes a certain amount of faith. Anyway, since we heard about it from two completely independent sources, my wife started taking it. Well, it wasn't a miracle. There was no immediate change. However, my wife gradually began to keep up with the baby's needs and has kept up ever since. Was it the Fenugreek? Perhaps. Maybe she was just adapting to the new baby. It's hard to tell. However, if anyone is having this problem, I'd say the Fenugreek is worth a try.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I was really skeptical at first. A lot of doctors refute any evidence that herbs like fenugreek can improve breast size. After the first day, my breasts started to feel heavier, fuller, and more firm. I started at an A-cup and even with inconsistent use (maybe 2 capsules a day or less), I was reaching toward a C-cup at the end of a couple months or so. I would highly recommend this product, cause it also helps with constipation too. I stopped taking it orally because I noticed my thighs getting a bit bigger too along with my breasts. So at the moment I'm gonna try making a rub out of it so I can just focus the interaction of the fenugreek on my breasts alone through direct massage.

I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up with my babies needs because my first 2 weeks back at work the baby ate more at daycare than I could pump.  Within a few days of taking the Fenugreek I was pumping more than he was eating.  I no longer have fears that I'll have to supplement with formula.

review/summary: Promotes Breastmilk Supply
review/text: I read on a breastfeeding website that you should take a bit more of this supplement than is listed on the bottle's directions. On day 1, I took 3 pills, 3 times per day, and the following day I pumped 6 more ounces of milk! I took the same amount of pills the 2nd day, and only 3 pills on the 3rd day. On days 2 and 3, I didn't pump because I was at home, but I was able to feed my baby without supplementing with formula. It was a 5-day holiday weekend, and at no time did I need to supplement, nor did I take any additional pills after those first 3 days. After the 5-day holiday, I pumped 16 ounces each day for 2 days in a row, and also breastfed my baby in the evenings when I got home from work with no problem. (That brings me to today, and I am still going strong.) Before that, I was lucky if I pumped 9-12 ounces! The side effects for me included that maple-syrup smell in urine/sweat, and it also upset my stomach, but it was only for a few days, so I thought it was worth it. The best thing is that, once your supply is increased, you can stop taking the pills.

review/summary: Works for me to increase breastmilk supply!
review/text: In preparation for going back to work, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep my breastmilk supply up to keep up with my baby.  I tried Motherlove More Milk Two Alcohol Free because Motherlove was recommended for increasing breastmilk supply in a pamphlet I got from my lactation consultant.  It didn't work for me.  So then I tried More Milk Plus Alcohol Free.  That also didn't work for me.  Finally after talking to a couple of people, they recommended Fenugreek, which I had read about before, but wanted to give Motherlove's More Milk product line a try because of all the great reviews I read.  I ordered Motherlove's Fenugreek, and finally my breastmilk supply started to go up.<br /><br />Before Motherlove's Fenugreek, I was pumping every 2.5 to 3 hours on average and getting about 3 ounces total (1 to 1.5 oz on left side and 1.5 to 2 oz on right side).  By the time I finished a 4 oz bottle of Motherlove's Fenugreek, I was still pumping every 2.5 to 3 hours but getting 4 to 5 oz total (up to 2 oz on left side and 2 to 3 oz on right side).<br /><br />I was worried about keeping up with my baby, but now my baby can't keep up with me.  After using Fenugreek for about a month, I'll have about 2 dozen 4 oz bottles of unfrozen milk in the fridge on any given day and I now have almost 80 frozen 5oz bottles in the freezer, and running out of room to store any more!<br /><br />Note: Although your supply increases, it does eventually plateau.  After finishing the Motherlove's Fenugreek, I switched to Nature's Way Fenugreek capsules because they're a fraction of the price, and you can take them with meals.  Motherlove recommends you avoid water 20 minutes before and after taking their product.  The Nature's Way capsules is maintaining my supply that Motherlove's started.<br /><br />In fact, now that I'm back to work, after my last pump in the morning, it will be 6 to 8 hours before I get to pump again at lunch at work, then another 4 to 5 hours after that before I get to pump again when I return home.  I then pump every 3 to 5 hours from the time I get home to the last time before work in the morning.  Even though I'm pumping less often than before (before it was after each feeding every 2.5 to 3 hours in a 24 hour span), I'm still pumping a very minimum of 5 oz total.  For those the times I have to go longer between pumps (more than 6 hours) I will pump up to a maximum of 11 to 12 oz total depending on how long I had to go between pumps.

review/summary: It really works if you take it properly!
review/text: I'm a working mother who was suffering from a steadily decreasing milk supply after returning to work.  Despite pumping every three hours at work (for a total of 3 pumping sessions per day), I was starting to have to top off my baby's bottles with frozen milk from my freezer stash.  At first it was an extra ounce a day, then two, then three.  As any breastfeeding mother knows, that's a dangerous road to go down because it can lead to even more supply issues in the future.<br /><br />I decided to try supplementing with fenugreek, but because I am naturally very suspicious of supplements and worried about side effects, I did a ton of research on the pros/cons of fenugreek before starting supplementation.  My research suggests that fenugreek can have an effect on blood sugar levels, so people with blood sugar issues should consult a doctor before trying the supplement.  I've learned to minimize the blood sugar effects for myself by always taking my fenugreek right after eating my main meals.  This way, the blood sugar effects are more than offset by the food in my system.<br /><br />The biggest mistake people make when trying fenugreek to increase milk supply is to not take enough of the herb.  It is critical to take enough, or you will not see any effect.  Some women can see an effect by taking 2 610mg pills three times a day (for a total of 6 pills a day).  Personally, I had to increase my dosage to 3 610mg pills three times a day (for a total of 9 pills a day) to get the desired effect.  Also, you have to be very consistent and really work hard not to skip any doses.  After a couple days of starting supplementation, I saw an increase in my supply, so I am now able to pump enough milk for my baby's bottles during the day while I am at work.  Thanks to the fenugreek, I'm getting a 2-3 ounce boost per day, which is not a huge amount, but it's all I needed.  Good luck!

review/text: I read all the reviews of this product and couldn't wait to use it. I took it for over a week when my baby started to get extremely fussy. The doctor determined she had colic, changed my diet, added special formula - still was not producing enough breast milk, and took me off all vitamins. After a week, she was becoming our happy baby again. I started taking this product again and within three days she started screaming again. I immediately stopped taking this and within a few days she was back to normal. For some reason this product bothered her stomach. I did not read anything about this in any of the reviews and want to let people know this could happen to them as well.

review/summary: Didn't Work
review/text: Too bad, they didn't work for me; I took 3 pills 3 to 4 times/day for about 2 weeks with no results.  In fact, they seemed to dry me up more, so I stopped using them.  I'm going to try drinking more water and eating oatmeal...

review/summary: Not a miracle cure, but definitely works
review/text: I ordered the supplement after realizing that pumping at work wasn't producing as much as I needed to cover what my 3-month old daughter drank at daycare, and I'm committed to exclusively breastfeeding for as long as the AAP recommends.  Currently I take two capsules with every meal (6 a day).  I began to notice increased engorgement probably about 48 hours after starting the supplement.  Since starting it, I've been pumping about 3-4 ounces more per day, which is enough to cover the gap I had been concerned about.  Although I myself was a bit gassy for the first few days, I didn't notice any side effects in my daughter (and I was definitely watching out for them).<br /><br />I should say, I had to stop taking the pills for a few days due to some minor surgery, and I did notice my supply go down again.  So the pills do work, but in my case at least I have to keep taking them to keep getting results.  I'm happy to do it for my baby :)

review/summary: My cup runs over!
review/text: A few weeks after my baby girl was born my milk started to decrease. A girlfriend of mine told me about Fenugreek to help increase my milk again. I take 2 pills three times a day. WOW, what can I say? My cup runs over. This is a great product to any mother and baby while nursing.

review/summary: Mothers: Helps milk production
review/text: I first tried fenugreek tea, but even my husband who loves tea said it was nasty.  My OB told me this would slighly help my milk production and she was right.  I wouldn't say a LOT, but probably added an extra feeding or so (4-ish oz) to my day.  I took 2 capsules 3x a day.  The side effect that we heard about (and laughed about) was totally true.  You WILL smell like maple syrup.  It's really odd and funny.  I made all my friends smell me.

review/summary: Worked Awesome for milk production
review/text: I was breastfeeding my twins and wanted a little help with milk production. I used it for about 2 days and saw a significant increase. I didn't notice any side effects, but I didn't take really high doses either ( I didn't need too). I was able to produce enough for the twins up to 5 months without needing any supplements, so it is not a situtation where I went from little production to a lot. I was producing a lot of milk to begin with and the fenugreek helped increase it enough that I didn't have to supplement with formula untill 8 months.

review/summary: Worked wonders for me!
review/text: I can honestly say that I noticed a significant difference in my milk production with 2 days of taking these pills. Almost everything I read from online resource sites kept saying to trust my baby and my body. Your body will produce what baby needs based on supply and demand. This wasn't working out so great for me. I breastfed full time from the day he was born and through his first month to establish my supply as the resources also stated. As well as pumped on occasion. Even then, however, my baby would fuss at nearly every feeding, especially when I had to feed on my right breast. How could I be expected to relax and just let the milk *slowly* come (drop by drop by drop) while my son is all but crying from hunger with my nipple in his mouth? It broke my heart! These pills turned out to be a life saver! Now he's 7 weeks old and I can pump 4.5 to 7oz per session and still feed him within 2hrs of pumping with no problems. As for that maple smell, I haven't experienced anything to that affect and most importantly - my baby is happy.

review/summary: Gave me an awesome boost to my breastmilk supply!
review/text: I went to a breastfeeding class at the hospital where I delivered my son about 6 wks before his arrival in 2010.  Five years before I had nursed my twins, but had given up at 10 wks due to not making enough milk & being totally exhausted from trying to keep up with both of them.  I wanted to be more successful this round.  The lactation nurse covered a bunch of details in the class but she specifically talked about some of the things moms could do to increase or maintain their natural milk supply.  She recommended fenugreek as one of the supplements that could be used that worked for a many people & had essentially no side-effects (the only thing mentioned was that mom's & baby's urine might smell like maple syrup which doesn't seem like a deterant to me!). I started using fenugreek less than 12 hrs after the birth of our son & I used it until he was 12 months old because that is when I weaned him.  I typically took two capsules at bedtime but if there were times I felt like my production was down, I would take it more frequently throughout the day. I have recommended this product for several friends & family members who have decided to breastfeed & will continue to. I'm so thankful that the lactation nurse knew about this product!

review/summary: It probably works but not for everybody
review/text: I got all exited seeing more reviews that it works.  My daughter is 3 half month and suddenly I start having less milk.  So I ordered fenugreek and blessed thistle in capsules.  I was taking 3 fenugreek and 2 blessed thistle with meals for a week and I didn't see really any change. One lady suggested me something else that helped her.  Walnuts!!!  I know from back in the days mom said that that's what doctors used to tell nursing moms.  To eat walnuts for more and fatty milk.  So I got a biggest bag they had in Walmart and ate it, I at probably good 6 oz of nuts at the end of the day I had more milk then my daughter needed and that night.  I am on my second day and so far I had enough milk and some extra.  I eat about 2 hand fools of walnuts a day.  My husband said it takes time for herbs to get into my system and seeing that its helping more moms, I will finish up the bottles and see if it will give me more milk.  I will get back on how it worked.  So moms try walnuts no other nuts but walnuts and see if that would help you, if fenugreek and blessed thistle didn't work for you. Gods Blessing!

review/summary: Smelled like syrup but no more milk
review/text: After reading reviews on this product I was really excited to get it and start taking it, I imagined all the milk I would start producing and how my baby would be guzzling it for months to come.  Unfortunately for me, the only thing that came true from the reviews I read was that I started to smell like maple syrup almost instantly. But I stuck with it, started taking 8 pills a day as opposed to 6 and after 2 weeks still no increase in my milk production. While I'm sure it works for some, if you're just not makig a whole lot of milk to start with, I don't think taking this will increase your supply much if at all. But if you think you'd like to smell like maple syrup then this is the product for you!

review/text: The product works well with Blessed Thistle.  The only thing I didn't like was the maple syrup smell that your pores give off while taking this.  My husband can smell when I'm around :) lol.  I stopped taking it for a few days when I was sick and I still gave off the smell.  I was down to only a few drops of breast milk and when I started taking these, I was able to start pumping 3 oz every time like usual.  I wish I was able to produce even more than that though because I am still having to supplement with formula.

review/text: I knew about fenugreek but my lactation consultant suggested that I take this in conjunction with Blessed Thistle (don't confuse with Milk Thistle).  It helped my supply increase some but not lots.  I took 3 fenugreek and 3 blessed thistle, three times a day.  Consult your lactation consultant about dosing size but this worked for me.  Apparently the fenugreek works best when paired with blessed thistle.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ET9W2">Nature's Way Blessed Thistle, Capsules 100ea</a>

review/summary: You bet it increases breast milk production!
review/text: I had not had a problem making enough milk for my little guy but a few weeks after I went back to work, I noticed I was having trouble pumping enough milk for him for the next day, not to mention to store in case of an emergency.<br />I was told to take 2 of these pills 3 times day.  First day I took it, I only took 2 pills because I wanted to see if a smaller daily intake would suffice.  Well, I'm glad I only took one dose because the next morning I woke up engorged.  Had I taken more I think my boobs would have blown up. I take 2 pills once a day and every morning my bra is soaked with milk.<br />Now I'm not so nervous about making enough milk for him and now maybe I don't have to lug that heavy pump back and forth from and to work.  Hopefully I'll be able to make enough in two pumps and I can leave it at work.<br />A couple of reasons for the 4 stars and not 5.  I do smell a hint of that curry smell, not great, but not overwhelming and also, my baby has been having issues with gas and has kept me up for a couple of nights.  I'm not sure though if Fenugreek has anything to do with it.  I'll update when I figure it out.

review/text: My daughter was LBW and didn't latch at all and I've somehow been able to exclusively pump for 3 months, and started to dry slowly. The fenugreek capsules worked marvels (I took 2 capsules thrice a day) and my supply has gone up!I saw some reviews about the taste of milk being syruppy...but nothing like that for me. It doesn't alter taste that much, and my li'l one is feeding just fine and I am so happy I am able to meet her demands even when exclusively pumping---thanks to Fenugreek

review/summary: Not a Good Brand for Milk Supply
review/text: This brand did not help me with my milk supply.  I bought it because it was a little cheaper than the other brand on this site, and found this to be inferior.  The capsules smell like medicine, not maple syrup, and after 2 weeks of taking 3 pills, 3 x a day, I never got the maple syrup sweat like I did with the other brand.  I will be switching back and paying a little more for the quality.

review/summary: Hit 2 birds with one stone
review/text: When my daughter was only a week old my milk supply went downhill fast. I also had lopsided breasts bc I avoided my right breast every once in awhile bc the nipple hurt. After talking to my doctor, she told me it was safe to try FENUGREEK (3 pills 3 times a day), BLESSED THISLTE (aka MILK THISTLE 1 pill 3 times a day) and MOTHERS MILK TEA (3-5 cups a day --- which I couldnt drink bc it was gross). About a week later my right breast caught up and I was pumping 3 oz per breast as to the 1 oz I was getting (my right breast was only droplets before). I am confident that my daughter is now getting full with each feeding. Only bad thing is the FENUGREEK gives my skin a weird smell but it is worth it!!!
