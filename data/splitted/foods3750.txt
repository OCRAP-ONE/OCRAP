review/summary: Best Espresso Roasted in the USA
review/text: I have been making and drinking espresso for well over 15 years. As I am sure many of you know, the keys to good espresso are: a good machine, a good grinder, a fresh roast, and freshly ground coffee.<br />I use a Pasquini Livia 90 and a Mazzer Mini grinder. This coffee is not designed for presses or drip coffee makers.<br />That said, short of what you might experience in Tuscany or Northern Italy, this is the best espresso you might hope to make at home.<br />When fresh, as it should be bought, the aroma from the bag is enough to convince you of the coffee's character.<br />The crema is thick, the flavor is rich and full without the bitter aftertaste you experience with many of the Seattle blends (including Starbucks). This coffee is to be enjoyed on it's own, with maybe a touch of sugar or possibly as an Americano, it may be OK as a macchiato, but does not hold up as well as a cappuccino, or a latte, since the milk has a tendency to overwhelm the delicate flavor of this coffee.<br />Once you have experienced Black Cat, it will make an indelible impression on your palate and you will likely become a Black Cat aficionado trumpeting it's amazing flavor to all your friends.

review/text: I can not tell you my love for Black Cat!!!! I mean I'm ordering espresso beans online come on I think that says it all! I first ran into this at Whole Foods and decided to try it, hands down one of the better beans out there. There is no bitter after taste and your breath isn't stale for days afterwards, also has an excellent crema oh and the beans aren't oily which ruins machines and gives you crappy espresso! If you like espresso I really recommend getting a bag of these you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Good
review/text: This is the only espresso bean I've bought, so I can't really compare it to other beans. But I like it. I just make regular coffee with it.<br /><br />Despite the instructions for my French Press to brew for only 4 minutes, I found that I had to brew for longer to bring out the rich sweet chocolatey taste. I let it stew for at least 8 minutes, but 15 minutes tastes good too. Brewing this bean for only 4 minutes results in a relatively diluted, tasteless coffee. I use a ceramic grinder to grind the beans immediately before brewing.<br /><br />It has a thick, mouthy texture. The beans smell strongly of smoky chocolate/truffle, almost cloyingly so. The taste is thick and sweet. I would recommend brewing for longer if possible to try and bring out more flavor.<br /><br />You get a 16 oz. (1 lb.) bag for the price, so it ended up being $20+ after shipping.

review/summary: Excellent Espresso
review/text: Pros:<br />Very complex<br />Rich<br />Excellent for doubles and triples<br /><br />Cons:<br />A bit expensive<br />Only adequate for singles<br /><br />Overall:<br />I very much like Black Cat Espresso. I consider it the bar against which other espressos are measured. I like it more than Kicking Horse, Lavazza, and Stumptown. Its flavor profile is very complex. It has its fair share of caramel and chocolate, but it also has a spicy, savory nature to it, and very fruity notes that come out well in singles.<br /><br />This is not a large-scale, homogenized coffee. Different regions and roasts result in different flavors from each bag. Sometimes that spiciness becomes a sort of salty flavor, and the fruits can turn very flowery. It is an easy espresso to make. Even shots that aren't perfect come out tasting pretty good. It's also a forgiving blend in that the shots are not prone to channeling.<br /><br />Singles are good, because any good coffee becomes light and toasty in a single, as opposed to the rich, crema-bombs of doubles and triples. Still, this espresso is very much intended for doubles or triples.<br /><br />In drip coffee, it's alright. And by drip, I mean any immersion process, be it French press, Aeropress, drip, pour-over, etc. The flavors get blown out, with the spices overwhelming the chocolates and caramels and resulting in a coffee that's not terribly smooth. Of the immersion processes, Aeropress tasted the best, probably because it most closely approximates espresso.<br /><br />Black Cat is a bit expensive, but not terribly so. Especially when one considers the increases in coffee as of late, -even Starbucks Tribute was $14 per pound- the price isn't crippling, but it is definitely above many other brands. You can save a little money by buying in five-pound bulks on Intellgentsia's website, but it's not a good idea to keep coffee beans around for that long when you can just as easily get it fresh.<br /><br />All said, Black Cat is espresso that more often than not finds its way into my machine.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Something that I forgot to mention in my initial review is that Black Cat is a very complex blend. That means that cheap stepped grinders WILL NOT grind the coffee correctly for espresso. Some higher-end stepped grinders will do the job, like the Rancilio Rocky, but you'll want a good, stepless grinder to fine-tune the grind. This is especially important if you have an espresso machine that's very picky about grind.<br /><br />Finally, this is not a terribly cremariffic espresso, which means to get a good amount of crema out of it, and thus really have a good canvas for latte art, you're going to have to prepare triples.

review/text: The price definitely worths it. This coffee is pure crema. The flavor is in its point. The texture is unparallel. If you gather with friends to share good espresso shoots or lattes, this is the bean you must acquire.<br /><br />Suggestion: This coffee should be use JIT (just in time). Order it once you are running low of beans and you'll always have fresh coffee.

review/summary: Amazing Esspresso! Intelligentsia Coffee Black Cat
review/text: I have been buying Intelligentsia Coffee Black Cat espresso for over 2 years now and it is amazing.<br /><br />My brew process is as follows:<br />Elektra Micro Casa Semiautomatica cappuccino machine, Breville Smart Grinder(with shim kit, a must!), 20grm of ground coffee in a 2 shot porta-filter, 25 second brew time and bam! Amazing mind blowing espresso goodness.<br /><br />Intelligentsia has never let me down with Black Cat espresso. The flavor profile varies according to the blends, but it is consistently delicious!<br />If you are having problems with the flavor i would look to your brew process. I learned my brew process by reading coffeegeek.com, home-barista.com and a lot of questions to the baristas at Intelligentsia.<br /><br />As a side note i buy and try many different coffees and there are many great ones but i keep coming back to Black Cat!<br />...also i stock up when i travel to Los Angeles. There is no place to purchase it(that i have found) in the San Francisco bay area and the shipping costs on-line are ridiculous!

review/summary: delicious, affordable espresso
review/text: great tasting mid-range coffee that made very smooth espresso.  came in an airtight bag with a one-way valve which helped the coffee keep its beautiful aroma and flavor well over a week.  brewed light, nutty and relatively sweet, although it was fairly easy to pull too slow and overpower the delicate flavor with bitterness.  very dry beans which are great for my burr grinder and home machine with a non-pressurized portafilter.<br /><br />pros - tasty coffee for a relatively affordable price.  dry, well roasted beans; good for your grinder and espresso machine.  well packaged; one-way valve on the bag is a plus.<br /><br />cons - I was expecting a solid medium roast from the description, but the coffee is medium-light at most.  flavor is delicate and overpowered in milk-heavy drinks, and can easily be ruined when brewed improperly.  Never produced a lot of crema, and existing crema was light in color and thin.

review/summary: Believe the Hype, worth the Price.
review/text: After having Intelligentsia about a year ago in LA, I was hooked. I never got around to getting my own espresso machine until the first quarter of 2011. After going through Starbucks's bitter espresso and local roasted espresso, I can unequivocally say there is nothing that really comes close, commercially, or locally. After several hundreds shots, Black Cat is the benchmark I compare all high quality espresso to, and rightfully so.<br /><br />My espresso machine isn't near as fancy as I wish, or anything like the ones in Intelligentsia Coffee shops, but Black Cat is the most forgiving espresso I have worked with. I will get some sub-par pulls, but each cup is just as good as the previous one. The espresso starts off sweet and syrupy, then mellow (yes mellows) out to a candy bold finish. There is no awful bitter bite at the end, or burnt over-roasted taste. Each sip is rich and satisfying, with no horrible "coffee breath" after taste. Take proper care when preparing each pull, and you'll be delighted by a wonderful cup of espresso.<br /><br />I must qualify my review by stressting the fact that this is an expensive espresso. If you want to get everything out of each cup, take the time to prepare each pull with diligence and care. If you have a quality grinder, buy the beans whole. Or, if you're a penny pincher (but uncompromising on your espresso), buy it ground. Only a high quality grinder will really prepare the grind fine enough since the beans are very oily. Also, this IS NOT the espresso to use if you're going to be making lattes. Black Cat is very sweet and stands on its own without sugary sweeteners or dairy. Make no mistake, Black Cat is best for straight espresso shots, and americanos.<br /><br />Overall, you get what you pay for. If you want a high quality, rich cup of stellar espresso, then buy Black Cat.

But I was blown away by the alternatives as well, it's my first expirience with an espresso that has all of the layers when it is made, from the deep brown espresso to the creamy foam called crema, it's a beautiful coffee that I suggest to anyone who is a true espresso fan...<br />This is not a planted review, I just love this coffee and want to share it with the world as it should be...

review/summary: Great for Everyday Espresso
review/text: This is what I drink (I usually rotate between Illy, Caribou's Sumatra and Black Cat). I first found it fresh in the Intelligentsia's Chicago Loop shop location, and now always buy it as fresh as I can. When I can, I prefer some of their single plantation beans, but the Intelligentsia Black Cat serves as nice everyday espresso.<br /><br />Sweet, a blend of several beans (Minas Gerais, Brazil and Santa Ana, El Salvador in this case), it finds an excellent balance that successfully avoids the burnt-bitter taste of other espressos.<br /><br />Feel good about it being direct trade, but buy it because of the quality. Help yourself enjoy it by purchasing it with as few middlemen as possible. I often get mine at a local grocer, but it is already a week old.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/text: I've heard of Intelligentsia before so I figured I'd give their flagship beans a try.  It tastes smooth but not particularly flavorful.  I've only made it with a french press so far so maybe espresso will offer a different experience.  Overall, Black Cat is an average coffee suitable for everyday drinking.  I honestly think that the generic store-brand beans from Whole Foods or Trader Joe's are comparable to or better than this.  I was expecting more when I paid $15 for 18 ounces.  Overall, I'm not too impressed.

review/summary: Great source for a hard-to-find item
review/text: I'm slowly baking my way through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312545525">Healthy Bread in Five Minutes a Day</a>.  I love the recipes, but a lot of the ingredients are harder to find than the basic ingredients from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312362919">Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day</a>.<br /><br />I went to all the major chain stores in my town and then the foreign markets and trendy healthy markets.  The only store that had even heard of Spelt Flour was the last healthy market, and they said that they just recently discontinued spelt.  So on a whim I searched for it on Amazon.  The price here on Amazon is cheaper than any of the other Arrowhead flours that I've bought at the local markets (plus free Prime shipping).  So not only did I find a good source for spelt, I'm going to start buying the rest of my specialty flours from Amazon (like rye and semolina).<br /><br />As for the product itself, it's a commodity...there's not much to say about it.  I've always been happy with the quality of Arrowhead Mills products though, and this one is no different.

review/summary: Arrowhead Mills Spelt Inconsistent in quality
review/text: For baking and cooking I have used all the Spelt flours available in the USA since 1999. I've frequently found Arrowhead Mills spelt flour to be old and stale. It seems that the age of this product varies widely as well as does availablity from store to store and there is little or no available white or light spelt grinds from Arrowhead, only whole grain being available. Other purveyors of Spelt flour provide a wide variety of grinds, dependable availability, quality and consistency as well as lower price per pound.

review/text: I was a little disappointed in these cracker flats -- they just didn't wow me.  My roommate, however, has become addicted to them.  I find they taste very good with cream cheese.  With or without cream cheese, though, they seem to give me heartburn (not sure why).  If you have never eaten these before, I would not recommend buying the pack of 6; see if you can find one box (in a health food store probably) and try them first.

review/summary: Inferior Coffee
review/text: This is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast.  The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona.  Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee.  The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price.  I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage.  I would never buy anything from Aloha Island Coffee company again.

review/summary: That's a lot of artichoke hearts!
review/text: Yes, there are a LOT of artichokes in each one of these cans.  More than can possibly be used it seems.  However, they freeze very well.  I split each can up into 6 seperate freezer bags.  This gave me approximately the amount that is normally in one of those grocery store cans per bag.  The grocery store cans typically cost more than $3 each so buying them this way is a huge savings.  Especially when they are on sale and you buy them via subscribe and save.  And their good.  Very tasty and tender.  Definitely a high quality product and I would not hesitate to buy them again.

She turns her nose up at all the best and most expensive food (Origen, Taste of the Wild, Wellness, Evo's 95% meat, Spots Stew, Science Diet, Paul Newman's, etc, etc, etc.) I feed her grain-free canned food through the day and she free-feeds on One Beyond through the night and likes it. She gets night-time munchies starting at 10p.m. and this food allows me some sleep. My picky picky princess surprisingly took to One Beyond right away, so I got her some in salmon flavor, too, which she also likes.

review/summary: My finicky cat loves this!
review/text: We have an eight year old Maine Coon that was a rescue. His stomach has always been sensitive and we've tried many different kinds of foods for him.  After using one of those high priced brands for some time, we discovered that they had changed their ingredients and were using only chicken by-products or chicken meal, instead of real chicken. And the corn products had moved up closer to the beginning of the ingredients list. Searching for something new, we tried this Purina One Beyond.  My cat LOVES it and the list of ingredients is closer to a natural diet.  He's been on this for three months now and after a few weeks, we noticed that his fur felt so soft and he seemed to have a lot more energy.  I have recommended this to all of my cat owner friends and they have noticed a good change in their cats also.  Thanks to Purina for making a product like this.

So I was really pleased to see a 'healthier' purina cat food, and decided to try it.  He absolutely refused to eat it. So I tried mixing it with the healthy life cat food, and he actually picked the healthy life out of the bowl piece by piece and left the rest.  It was a total waste of money.

He does not much care for what I call "foreign" or "ethnic" food having grown up in the mid-west, with mid-western parents whose mother cooked standard "meat and potatoes" meals.  I have tried to introduce him to middle-eastern, chinese, and all kinds of other foods.  I think I snuck this in for him, he is now about addicted to it!!  Initallly, I had ordered the largest amount I could find (in bulk) and together we have now finished it all.  So, of course, I had to get more!  We are making a good start on this next batch from Amazon. It is just as good as the first batch I had purchased, and for this one, I didn't have to pay shipping!  Yaay!

review/summary: Fantastic "candy"
review/text: Tasty & addictive!  I remember as a child, my mother used to bring these treats home from the health food store in the late 70's/early 80's. I loved them then, and still do.  My children now love them, too.  Although technically a "candy," these sesame-packed treats aren't that bad.  At least real sugar and corn syrup are used with honey, as opposed to High Fructose Corn Syrup, which is the "bad" type of corn syrup.<br /><br />We are making our own sesame & honey pasteli now, so that we can be sure of the ingredients.  They cost more, due to the local, small-batch honey and Lyle's Golden Syrup we prefer, but it is worth it. I think these Joyva sesame honey crunch wafers are the next best thing to homemade.  My shipment came in a plastic bag, weighed the 3lbs I purchased, and were individually-wrapped with Joyva brand wrappers.

review/summary: Hard to find Cream of Onion Soup
review/text: Campbell's Cream of Onion Soup is the base ingredient for a Chicken and Rice Casserole that is a family favorite.  We've had a hard time finding this product for many years, and basically impossible to find the last 5 or more (Note found it in stock in Jacksonville, FL WalMart on 4/2008 vacation).  We've tried other onion soups but not "cream", and the difference is clear.  The other "Campbell" soups we use with the Onion are Creams of Chicken, Cheddar, and Mushroom.  They are blended together and baked over boneless, skinless chicken, and served over rice.  We have  subbed for the Chicken on occasion with the likes of Celery, but they do not match up with the Onion.

Cream of Onion is a vital ingredient.  There is NO substitute.<br /><br />1 Can - Campbells Cream of Onion Soup<br />7 - Large White Potatoes (Peeled and Sliced)<br />*Note:  Potatoes should not be sliced uniformly.  Some should be significantly thicker than others, with the thickest being about 1/4 of an inch.<br />1 - 12 oz. Can - Evaporated Milk<br />9 to 12 slices of WHITE American Cheese<br />*Note:  This cheese should be purchased at your grocer's deli counter.<br />Do not use pre-packaged "singles."  Also, do not use orange American cheese.  Clearfield, Land O Lakes, or ShurFine brands work nicely.<br /><br />Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Position rack in center of oven.<br />Line bottom of oven with oven liner or tin foil in case of dripping.<br /><br />Generously grease the bottom and sides of a 3 or 4 quart casserole or baking pan.<br /><br />In large measuring cup or bowl, whisk together the soup and the evaporated milk.<br /><br />Layer ingredients into greased pan as follows:<br /><br />Small amount of milk/soup mixture - just enough to coat bottom of pan.<br /><br />1/3 of Potatoes in a single layer<br />3 or 4 slices of White American Cheese<br />1/3 of remaining milk/soup mixture<br /><br />Repeat layers until all ingredients are used.<br />Cover tightly with aluminum foil.  (I use "release" non-stick foil, but any will do.)<br />Bake for 1 hour.  Remove foil and return to oven for approximately 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly on top.<br /><br />Potatoes will need to sit about 15 minutes before serving.<br /><br />Enjoy!  And please share this recipe.  We'd like to keep this soup on the market!

review/summary: cream of onion soup
review/text: Campbell's Cream of Onion Soup is hard to find, so I ordered a dozen cans and used them all during a winter. I don't ever consume it a soup. I use it to make a wonderful gravy for pork<br />chops. Pork chops can dry out so quickly, and this takes care of the problem and adds great flavor.  I usually brown them in a pan, then add the can of soup with about a third of a can of milk then scrape the good browning pieces at the bottom of the pan and mix in the pan. It makes a wonderful, hearty golden-brown gravy in which to simmer chops. The pork is moist and falls apart with a fork. Great gravy for potatoes too.

I became upset that nowhere in the stores could I find this soup.  I finally did find a can at Wal Mart.  I ordered a case from Amazon and am using it as a cooking base in my cooking.  Don't know why the stores aren't carrying it.  I even asked Harris Teeter's but since I only wanted a couple of cans, they probably weren't interested in stocking it.  However, the soup makes a good flavor base for your cooking, I think.

review/text: THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT...for many reasons!!!!!<br /><br />AFTER using "Splenda" exclusively for about years, ((my doctor said my incipient diabetes had disappeared due to my loss of 40 pounds in three months, (secret: try to stop eating at 6:PM....or 12 noon, if you can, have LOTS of Bird's Eye trayed vegetables, (yum!), eat baked potato chips, (if you must), one at a time, and with each bite tell yourself how bad these are for you.....and, (again if you must), "snack" on lemonade, coffee or tea...s l o w l y....after 6pm)), I just got some C & H PURE CANE SUGAR at my local supermarket -- mainly to save money, as "Splenda", (also reviewed by me for Amazon), is a wonderful product....but very<br />expensive, (especially in the bagged variety -- which I recommend, not only for baking, as the manufacturer does, but also for diabetics, as it does not have the "dextrose", (a extra form of sugar), that the packets contain.)  Intending to, in future, mix cane sugar with Splenda, (if you do it yourself, it HAS to be cheaper than any manufacturer doing it for you, doesn't it?), I have -- just to start off with -- had my first cup of coffee in two years, with JUST cane sugar, and no Splenda. Then, just<br />of curiousity, I looked up "Cane Sugar" on Amazon....in the "Grocery"<br />section, of course....my local supermarket (King Sooper's), is known<br />for selling much organic food -- but just a slightly-higher-than-normal<br />-supermarket's share of gourmet products.<br /><br />Well, C & H Pure Cane Sugar was NOT in Amazon's "Grocery" section. But<br />many, many exotically-titled cane sugars were.  I never knew there were<br />SO many varieties of cane sugar!  But...where was the plain, ordinary<br />C & H cane sugar I could find in my local supermarket?<br /><br />The only other place I could think to look for C & H Pure Cane Sugar<br />was in the "Gourmet" section.  Doing this seemed to me akin to shopping at Tiffany's in a pair of work-overalls....but there was nowhere else<br />on Amazon I could think of looking for it....so I did.  THERE IT WAS!<br />AND A LOT CHEAPER THAN MANY OF THE EXOTIC AND/OR ORGANIC CANE SUGARS LISTED UNDER 'GROCERY'!<br /><br />C & H Pure Cane Sugar, tasted wonderful in my coffee!  And, therefore, seems to be a true 'bargourmet' food....that very rare variety of food,<br />(and/or other commodities), which combine high quality and the "cachet" of being a gourmet product, with the bargain price associated with supermarket, grocery, or discount stores.<br /><br />My advice?  Buy it!

review/text: I tried this after trying (and loving) the Tea's Etc Organic Coconut-Almond add-on.  This is a very good tea. It's a little mild for my tastes, as I was expecting the tea and ginger to have bolder flavors. (I'm not astute enough about tea to know if this is a blend issue or a freshness issue. Given the strong aroma I suspect the former.) That said, I really do enjoy it and just find myself using a pinch more and letting it seep longer to achieved the desired outcome. The aroma is wonderful and I think this is a perfect afternoon tea. (Who doesn't feel more energized after getting a whiff of citrus?!). The fact that the flavor isn't overpowering also makes it a good choice for folks who want to ease into drinking green tea. I'll order this again, but it will be awhile.  These "small" 3-oz packages last an impressively long time even with daily consumption!<br /><br />Update 9//11/12:  I paid $8.62 for this item.  I see it's now selling for less than $2...

review/text: Being a cherry flavor enthusiast, I had high hopes for these. My first bar was quite burned. So it tasted a bit ashy. It was chewy and not the most pleasant consistency. The cherry jelly inside was kind of tough. It reminded me more of a cookie than it did a breakfast bar.<br /><br />I'm going to try warming these for 15 seconds next time, and maybe it'll soften up and be more pleasant.

review/summary: Best GF fruit bar I've had yet... but it's only been a week.
review/text: I'm waiting on test results, but have been giving the GF lifestyle a shot for the past week, due to some ongoing GI issues. This is the third fruit bar I've tried; the other two were Bakery On Main Apple & Cinnamon Soft & Chewy Granola and Enjoy Life Caramel Apple Chewy On The Go Bar. Bakery On Main's was OK. Enjoy Life's was pretty nasty.<br />And this Glutino Cherry Breakfast Bar just blew both of them out of the water.<br />I have pretty much no complaints. Sweet, soft, not particularly gritty, it didn't make a crummy mess on my desk, and it didn't taste nearly as dry or unpleasant as I was expecting. It was... well, yummy!<br />Admittedly, I don't have much basis for comparison to other GF bars; like I said, it's only been a week. But this was pretty darned good.

review/summary: Almost want to eat one myself BUT...
review/text: These tasty morsels of dehydrated apple slice  wrapped in a strip of chicken are represented as being " all natural"  , "premium chicken breast" "no by-products - no preservatives " AND are said to contain 115 mg. of glucosamine HCl an 80 mg. of chondroitin SO4.  AND...the dogs LOVE them.  HOWEVER...Look at the label a little closer and it is made where???  MADE IN CHINA  . In a disclaimer addressing this concern ( remember the dogs and cats dying due to melamine poisoning to their kidneys when the Chinese manufactured protein was enhanced with the deadly protein heavy plastic used in dog food European , Canadian and American manufacturers had purchased from China?)  a paste on circular label has been attached to the front stating " Tested in USA"...and explaining that the testing is random and performed regularly. SINCE THERE IS NO AGENCY REGULATING/ MANDATING quality control in the US of dog food manufactured elsewhere ,  my question is By whom ?  May I see the results of the tests?  Who is doing the testing?<br />One treat a day for each dog ( Bichons) and they scarf it down and LOVE it....so the four stars for appeal.  I am acting on good faith giving it to them and hoping I am not sorry at a future date.  They really do look yummy!!!

review/text: I have 3 dogs, a Boston Terrier, a Rat Terrier and an American Eskimo, the one thing they have in common is their love of Loving Pets 100% all natural treats.  They love them all, the chicken with banana, apples, carrots and sweet potatoes.  I didn't expect them to like the chicken with the biscuit, but it is my Boston's new favorite.  I usually buy 25 packs at a time because I can not risk running out!  My 14 and a half year old American Eskimo runs over to the cupboard and spins around like a circus dog until she gets her treats!  My Rat Terrier used to be a picky eater but she always eats these!

Mind you, it's certainly hot, but not overpoweringly so.  The sweetness of the peach puree and sugars still stands out, at least to me, while the heat more or less sneaks up on you and builds.  Then again, I also like anything made with habanero, so I like super-hot sauces and spices.<br /><br />Even still, if you're a chilihead, I highly recommend this sauce!  The smoky sweetness will get you hooked, while the heat will blow you away!

review/summary: Love the Brownies!!! I can eat it all day! LITERALLY!!
review/text: I AM NEW TO MEDIFAST (one week)! MY VERY FIRST ITEM TO ORDER---BROWNIES! My first 2 pk were experimental, BUT PACKETS 3 THRU 7 WERE PERFECT & DELICIOUS. The first  I followed the directions: added 3TB water & microwaved 1m 15sec & another 15sec & another etc. up to 2 mins & it was still under cooked, watery like rice pudding &lt;ate it anyways, but was disappointed, it didn't look like youtube's fitandfabBy40. I had  viewed her video making it &  it looked just like a brownie>. My second attempt, I baked as I had read here on review, but it didn't rise at all instead deflated to thin layer (which I put in freezer & took it out couple hours later & ate it between my fingers like a piece of chocolate square---tasted just like a Frozen Fudgesicle...WOW) hope for it yet i thought. Then the 3rd packet I decided to only add 2 Tablespoons of water, stir & then it was too thick, so i added 1/2 tbsp more & mixed again until it's like a thick fudge consistency. Microwaved for 1 min & 15 secs. And VOILA!! Finally that worked, I watched the brownie rise almost to the top of the cardboard & was very happy...IT BAKED JUST LIKE A BROWNIE! I LOVE IT!!The rest of my brownies came out just as perfect.... I ended up having brownies 2 more times. whoa went through that box. Love the Brownies & they are now my favorite to have with my dinner.

review/summary: Wonderful Croustades (Crispy Cups)
review/text: I have been using these croustades for many years, but I am now finding them hard to get.  I am delighted that Amazon will have them.<br /><br />They are extremely versatile.  I use them for both savories and sweets, but sweets are my favorites!  Their only drawback is that many recipes cannot be made far ahead, since the cups do soften, so I make many things ahead, popping goodies into the cups at the last minute.<br /><br />Some things can be made ahead; I make mini pecan pies, using my usual recipe with more, and finer ground pecans.  They bake up in about ten minutes, and keep for weeks.  I also make tartlets ahead by pouring melted chocolate, white, dark or milk, into the shell, tipping to cover to the edges and draining on a rack over a pan.  When set up, these will take chocolate mousse, ganache truffle mixtures, unbaked cheesecake mixtures, lemon curd, etc., and will be crisp for days.  They are beautiful additions to a dessert tray.  I also make mini pumpkin and mince pies, but these will soften eventually.  I quickly fill them and bake them just before dinner, or just before dinner's end, and they are delicious with a dab of brandied whipped cream or hard sauce for the mince.<br /><br />These are less trouble than either phyllo or puff pastry, and are thinner, allowing more of the taste of the filling to dominate.  There are a million uses I haven't mentioned; only your imagination limits you!

review/text: I don't know what the other reviewers prepared as a filler for their tarts -- clearly one can hide their taste (petroleum and preservatives) with something rich and robust -- but why try.  You get what you pay for, and with this item, you get something akin to cardboard.  I'm sure that their shell life (atomic half life) is somewhere around 200 years, so if we ever have to back to stocking fall-out shelters, this is the item you'll be looking for.<br /><br />I purchased a case to try out in preparation for a catering I was planning, and handed a cup to my girlfriend who is a non-chef.  Her first comment on the taste was "petroluem."  On the plus side, I can't imagine these cups every springing a leak or getting soggy.  In fact, I can't imagine that my body could digest them once swollowed.  Save your money and order unbaked pastry cups shipped overnight on dry ice by Dufour Pastry Kitchens in the Bronx.  They have a wide variety -- including blue corn, and they are not only digestable, but taste good.

review/text: I am a big fan of Frontier already, but when I received these flowers, I was amazed. You can tell just by looking at them that nothing else has been done to these flowers except drying. The leaves are still in tact and the wonderful color makes holiday tea packs I've made bright and vibrant.<br /><br />This chamomile has worked wonders on taking the excessive bitterness from some black teas. I just mixed 3 parts black tea with 1 part of this chamomile and the quality of the tea changed drastically.<br /><br />I was nervous about getting the 1 lb. bag, but there is hardly any tea I drink now without adding a few of these flowers. It really adds a smoothness to all teas. In addition, I brewed down some of the flowers and used the tea to cut some of the nastiness out of homeopathic medicines I make. It worked really well and also adds the nice calming effect of chamomile to medicines.<br /><br />These are VERY high quality flowers and I have really enjoyed them.

review/summary: Solved Dogs' Digestive Problems
review/text: I added two Schipperke puppies to my home eight years ago.  Shortly after they arrived, they became sick with a parasite known as coccidia.  From that moment on, I lived a wretched existence comprised of constant cleaning (both the dogs and anything they came near), dog antibiotics, vet bills, emergency room visits, more vet bills, on and on.  By the time they were two years of age, they were down to eating only rice mixed with turkey baby food (per vet instructions) and my bank account was depleted by thousands of dollars.  Yet still they suffered from diarrhea and occasional bouts of vomiting.  One day I found this food on the internet, and thought, "what the hell - I've tried everything else."  When the food arrived, I mixed the "dust" (reminded me of fish chum we used as kids) with cooked turkey, water, and olive oil.  I fed it to the dogs.  They loved it, but I expected after a year of rice and Gerber's, they'd have loved anything.  By day three, their diarrhea had stopped, and the only time it has returned in the past six years is when I have run out of this food and fed them something different.  Truly.  Day THREE!  After a two-year ordeal! This food saved my dogs' lives.  I notice that the formula has changed a bit over the years, and now the package directions suggest adding an egg and fish oil - and not to use olive oil.  I just keep making it the way I always have.  They still love it.<br /><br />There are downsides to using this food:  it's soft, so plaque and tartar build up much faster than if the dogs were eating crunchy food.  Also, I have to make a "batch" of food for them. I usually buy 2-1/2 lbs. of ground turkey, cook it up, grind it in the food processor, add it to 2 cups of dust, 2-1/2 cups of water, 1/4 cup olive oil, then mix it all together.  Then, using a small ice cream scoop (1/4 cup), I put the food into those small disposable plastic containers made by Glad.  This usually gives me 56 containers (two weeks' worth of breakfast and dinner for both dogs).  I freeze the containers, putting them into the refrigerator the night before as necessary.  In the morning, I dump the containers in their bowls, and microwave for 20 seconds.  I guess this is a long way of saying it's more labor intensive than throwing a handful of kibble into a bowl.  But, it has definitely been worth it for me and my dogs.<br /><br />I would enthusiastically recommend this food to any pet owner.

review/summary: Helped my dog.
review/text: My dog started having seizures around the age of four. I kept track of them, on the calender, and noticed that the seizures happened about every 30 days. The vet told me that it was probably a brain tumor, since epileptic seizures usually start at a younger age. This did not make sense to me, since the seizures were consistent in their timing. I decided to switch him to a grain free diet and found Urban Wolf. My dog has been seizure-free for quite some time now,(he just turned 11.) I do recommend that you give your dog a vitamin supplement, such as Pet Tabs. (By the way, he gets a double-dose of the Pet Tabs and it has greatly reduced his itching to the point where he's no longer on steroids.) I have also tried the doggie burgers from the pet store. They gave the poor little guy really hard stools. This stuff is worth the time and trouble to make, he's much healthier now.

review/summary: all 12 dogs went gaga over it
review/text: When I opened the bag initially, I was horrified to see some sort of brown powder-ish fluff, instead of little freeze-dried chunks of vegetables, as I was expecting.  Well, I made some anyway according to the package directions, and my dogs absolutely LOVE it.<br /><br />I have 12 dogs, including one 18-yr-old and one 15-yr-old who are VERY finicky (probably cats in their former lives) and even those two absolutely loved it, so suffice to say it tastes VERY good to them, even though to be frank it smelled kind of iffy to me.  Definitely not a bad smell, just an unusual smell of some sort of herbs, and I was worried that no one would eat it-- Wrong!)<br /><br />To clarify, this is NOT "8 lb of food for $100"; this is a mix of freeze-dried vegetables that you combine with meat (raw or cooked) and an egg and maybe some fish oil for good measure.  Even with 12 dogs this will take us forever to get through.  In the meanwhile I'm storing the powder in wide-mouthed jars to keep the moisture out.  You can go to the Urban Wolf website (google for it) to get estimates of how long a bag will last.  Also check out the nutritional information while you are there.<br /><br />I don't plan on using this when lots of vegetables are in season, but for the times of year when choices are fewer, this is a great way to ensure a diversity of vitamins.

review/summary: Love this plant!
review/text: This is the second pitcher plant that I have owned but the first that I have bought from Hirt's. It came in two days in a box that was so carefully packed that if felt like I was opening a gift. There was a small heat pack to keep the plant safe and each of the pitchers were carefully wrapped to protect them - I was blown away!  The plant is so healthy and absolutely beautiful; I will be ordering more soon!! No one does plants this way and this is the way it should be done.<br /><br />Hirt's sets the standard!

review/summary: Great condition
review/text: This is the only seller I know that sells N. Alata which is the easiest nepenthes to take care of. And buying other nepenthes from other sites, I realized how this seller has sent me the nepenthes in great/best condition. Every single leaves were green and healthy along with big pitchers. I've bought nepenthes and some other plants from other sellers but some of the leaves were most of the times brown and the pitchers are always small. This seller on the other hand, sends me the plants in the best condition.<br /><br />I'm definitely looking forward to buy this nepenthes again from this seller. I mean this is the only seller so far that has sent me nepenthes with big pitchers with good price.

review/summary: Hirt's Pitcher Plant
review/text: I live in Montana, I ordered the pitcher plant January 15, and received it January 18. There is 12+ inches  of snow outside. Temperatures in the mid to low 20's. The plant I received was above and beyond all expectations. I have ordered Carnivorous plants including other nepenthes from other businesses that ship both bare root and potted.  Never have I been more pleased with the obvious care taken to package and ship my carnivorous plants.  Wrapped gently in news paper, then packing peanuts.  The good people at Hirt's Gardens also put in heating packs at no extra charge. There was no frost bite, the pitchers were in immaculate condition.  The plant has not one but two very healthy growth points. I just cant say enough good things about it. Could not be happier.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: After reading all the other reviews I have to say mine did not measure up to their comments.  Was definately not packed the way others described, dirt all over the place and the pitchers all tangled up.  I think it will survive though so don't regret the purchase.

review/summary: More product info would have been helpful
review/text: This is an example of why it annoys me when Amazon doesn't post the ingredients for their food items. Honestly, how hard could it be to just scan that portion of the package in? The description didn't tell much about what was in this, so I went to Cat Cora's website. No more info there, just that it contained sun-dried tomato, feta and herbs, so I purchased it. Well, turns out it has a LOT of black olive in it! Sure, most tapenades do, but not always, and you'd expect it to be mentioned. I don't care at all for black olives, so I ended up giving them away to two friends. One reported back that it was "OK" and the other didn't say anything, which I'm assuming means she didn't like it.

review/summary: Breakfast of Champions.."Wheatgrass..NOT 'Wheaties!'";o)
review/text: Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I start mine with a 'Smoothie',containing wheatgrass as a base, and then add fresh fruit,(your choice), flaxseed, fresh spinach and 1- 1/2 cups of POM juice. Blend and enjoy. I do not add ice...I drink it at room temperature...the choice is yours again..add or not to add ice. There's something about the wheatgrass that not only tastes good, but I know what it does for the body! Good stuff! Try: 1 cup of 2% milk, 1 lg. scoop vanilla ice cream and 1 lg. scoop of wheatgrass...mix in blender and drink. En-er-GEE, soooooo good!!

review/text: I made this for the first time today.  I have had flan in Spain and Mexico, and my mother and wife both make excellent flans.  I was expecting this Roland Flan to be mediocre and artificial.  I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was.  In fact, it was excellent.  I'm going to buy some more.

review/summary: This is Wonderful Stuff!
review/text: I am not generally a big fan of guacamole, and originally got this salsa for our oldest daughter, who loves the stuff. But one taste of this smooth, flavorful salsa, and I was hooked. It's on the higher end of spicy, but the heat goes away with protracted tasting. Tastes really, really good IN things, as well as on them.
