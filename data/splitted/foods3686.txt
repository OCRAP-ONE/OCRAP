review/summary: New and Improved Formula Much Better!!!!!!!!
review/text: I have been using this brand for about two months, but I was using the one with the new and improved formula. I decided to give this a try since it was cheap and I thought the Bavarian Chocolate would taste more chocolate-tier than the regular chocolate. I was wrong this one doesn't dissolve as well and it doesn't taste like chocolate, it's more of a bitter taste. Also it doesn't  keep me full 4-5 hours like the other one does.I will be going back to the one that is sold in the bag since it taste amazing and it's $20 at Sams Club!!! The new and improved formula is the way to go!!!!

review/summary: As good as they say...
review/text: This is the first and only meal replacement that I have ever tried but I have read and heard about how the taste of some are just awful. With that being said I consider myself lucky. Simply because the Naturade barvarian chocolate and strawberry flavors are really pretty good.<br /><br />I usually mix with either lactaid milk (2%)or rice milk (vanilla flavored)and I have tried water. I shake mine, does a very good job (IMHO) but you have to really shake things up. Works better than a blender, I think.<br /><br />Using lactaid (10 oz) the drink is kind of thick if you use the two scoops recommended which I do,  my wife uses one scoop in 8 oz. Using water or rice milk both have the same consistancy which is much thinner with a loss of some flavor. I prefer the lactaid milk...<br /><br />The powder is very fine and can be packed like moist chalk dust. With that being said packing the scoop makes mixing more difficult, which I believe maybe the source of the lumps.<br /><br />I drink one 10 oz cup in the morning with my vitamins and another after work then a have a smaller helping for dinner. When I first started I would have all kinds of cravings so I started eating more fruit during the day so from that perspective I do eat more little meals through out the day, but I have lost 6 lbs in a month without any excercise.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend at least giving Naturade a try...

review/summary: Tried others, this one is best value
review/text: I have purchased another soy based chocolate power product (ASIN: B000HCX5RQ), and that other one wasn't as good as this Naturade Total Soy.  We have this just about every morning in smoothies (1 1/2 scoops, 8-12 frozen strawberries, 1 TBS chocolate cocoa mix, 3 cups milk, 2 bananas).  Although my recipe may not be the healthiest, it tastes great.  I have also tried the French Vanilla Total Soy as well, but we love chocolate too much to switch.<br /><br />Also with respect to the other brand mentioned, I had to use 3x as much cocoa to cover up the after taste.  This Naturade version has a very slight after-taste - probably due to the soy - but it's better than using pure cocoa!<br /><br />Update: All Star Health is very very fast.  I reordered it on 9/10 and received the very next day.  It wasn't expected to arrive until 9/16.  I will order from them again.  It's too bad this item from them is not on the subscription program.

review/text: I am normally very skeptical of high praise on these reviews, as I generally think that it is coming from the seller.  No reviews can prepare you for how amazing this soup is.  I have lived in Eastern nations, and I have not been able to find a curry like this in the United States.  The taste is phenomenal and complex, and this soup would be great to mix with a rice, or as a filling thermos drink.  Again, I am in awe at how amazing this product is!!

review/text: To rate a product low because you didn't read the ingredient list to know it contained chicken broth is misleading on the products quality.  This soup is scrumptious, just as the title of this review says.  It's creamy, flavorful, and fulfilling enough as an entree.  We don't eat large portions of food and found this soup to be just what we need on weeknights, sometimes with a nice arugula salad on the side.  I imagine it would make a delicious base for other meals as well, including Indian dishes.

review/text: This soup is very delicious if you like curry and lentils, a perfect blend of flavors and so healthy, too. It is so good it is addictive. I never get tired of it. I have tried many of the other Pacific Soups but none are as good as this one. For those of us saddled with restrictive diets (not vegan), a boring diet is hard to overcome. This soup meets all the requirements that I need to eat both protein and and gluten-free fiber at every meal. When it started disappearing from the stores (in Denver), I was devastated. Kudos to Whole Foods for turning me onto Amazon.com and kudos to amazon.com for selling discontinued foods.

review/text: We first found out about this pancake mix years ago, when we vacationed at Ocean City, Maryland (it has been our favorite family vacation destination since our children were toddlers.)Just by curiosity, we had them for breakfast one morning and loved them since.<br />Anyway, we found it at Food Lions grocery stores, I used to get in trouble by getting about a dozen of these mix to take along home, since we cannot find these in Lancaster, PA. where we are from.<br /><br />This past summer, we could not find this mix anywhere, including the grocery stores in Ocean City, we though it maybe a local favorite. What a disappointment, we like Bruce's canned yam too, no problem finding them, so why don't they make more of the mix. We found some sweet potato mix at the local stores, but they are considered Kosher food, and they ARE NOT the same as Bruce's.<br />If any of you Bruce's fan know a store in Lancaster area that carry this product, please post it here, we would be really grateful.

review/summary: *This* is tea.
review/text: I have tried many kinds of tea, and quite honestly don't like many.  However, the tea I tried before wasn't fresh.  I know now, because I bought this tea.  Potent and aromatic, just opening the small twist-tied bag shows just what quality this tea is.<br /><br />1.6 oz for $17 may seem incredibly pricy for some, but honestly, you won't go back to drinking the cheap stuff ever again. Also, you don't need much to make a couple usable infusions.<br /><br />Flowery and light, this tea smells, looks, and tastes fresh in every cup.  It would be easy to overload with the amount of tea used... so try no more than a pinch for a 12 oz cup.  You may have to wait a few minutes, but the result will be fine.<br /><br />This supplier and this tea will not dissappoint.  Fast shipping, excellent quality.<br /><br />I will be buying my tea from them from now on.<br /><br />*edit(5/16/08): fixed embarrassing spelling mistake.

review/text: Love this tea, it's as good as Teavana's silver needle and nowhere near as expensive. I ordered this like 4 days ago, and it's already here. I'm baffled, but grateful. The taste is great, but I mix my cup with a dried mint leaf or some lavender from the front yard just out of personal preference. The seller had time to hand-write a thank you with a happy face on my order copy and that, to me, is an excellent customer service technique of a growing business. The tea comes in a tied plastic bag in a nice tall tin container with an air-tight tin and plastic lid. I'm gonna re-use the container for sure, the label can be peeled off. Let's face it, coffee leave's a person's breath smelling like turd. White tea has half the caffeine of a cup of coffee if you steep it over 3 minutes, and this is a suitable (but not perfect) replacement for coffee in the mornings before class when I have to hold conversations with people. I can take the discreet container in my book bag to school, grab a cup of hot water in the cafeteria, and get my caffeine fix!

review/text: I use garlic a lot when I cook (not only does garlic add a nicer taste to dishes, it is also a pretty healthy addition to one's diet). When I'm motivated, I use the real deal, chop it, crush it, etc. However, sometimes I prefer to take a shortcut. When that is the case, McCormick Minced Garlic does the trick.<br /><br />When I make my broccoli salad, using this product saves me some time, adds a nice taste to the salad, and, I hate to admit it, is awfully easy on me!<br /><br />So, if one is a bit lazy, this is a useful product. It's not the same, of course, as fresh garlic, but it does the job!

review/text: For years I have always used fresh garlic. My special salad dressing calls for minced garlic. Now, arthritis prevents me from mincing by hand. I tried the minced garlic in jars with liquid. The texture and taste were very disappointing.<br /><br />A few months ago, I decided to try the McCormick's Minced Garlic. The aroma, texture, flavor are so close to fresh garlic. My family has not noticed the change. I am now on my third bottle and plan to buy the pack of 6 sold here on Amazon. If you use a lot of fresh garlic, try one 3 oz. container. You may never buy fresh garlic again.

review/summary: Dried garlic bits: excellent product, for what it is!
review/text: I do like to eat, but... I am a combination of busy/lazy. Mashing fresh garlic can be messy, smelly and time consuming. Therefore, I believe I am a perfect consumer for this minced garlic product. The garlic bits are big enough to be noticed in soups and stews, but small enough to provide gentle taste for home made garlic bread and salads. In fact, last weekend I used it in olive oil for bread dipping (I made the mix a few hours ahead in order for the garlic taste to soak thru the olive oil, and then added freshly ground parmesan directly before serving; tasted yum!).<br /><br />BTW: Buying this product in bulk (the package contains six shakers), I was concerned about its freshness. However, I needn't have worried. The expiry date was Nov 29, 2012. Secondly, the price of the product on Amazon was excellent, particularly as I purchased it under the Subscribe and Save program. I highly recommend it!

review/summary: get some today and ignore the diet debacle for a while (three and one-half stars)
review/text: Kellogg's Frosted Rice Krispies Cereal is absolutely scrumptious! Sure, it's all in the sugar (smile); but once in a while you can give yourself a treat. It may be a better alternative to nothing for antsy kids who really didn't want any breakfast before school. As long as you eat these before the expiration date stamped on the box they will be delicious!<br /><br />The cereal is indeed fat and cholesterol free. That's great. The cereal contains no trans-fats--that's even better! There are 27 grams of carbs in each serving; so please be careful of that although on the other hand it's only about 9% of your daily limit for carbs as suggested by the government. Each serving of this cereal also has 25% of your recommended daily intake of Iron, Niacin, and Vitamins B12 and B6.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as you probably guessed by now, there's a price to be paid for all this. The cereal has sugar--18 grams of it when served in milk! If sugar is a dietary issue for you, consult your doctor before eating any of this cereal. There is no calcium at all in this cereal; and that's a disappointment. Sigh.<br /><br />After all is said and done, this cereal tastes great and it's a pleasure to eat--especially in the morning when you may want a pleasant, sweet start to a tough day ahead. However, the dietary issues do cause some concern; and I will take off one and � stars for this issue. Of course, life still is rather short however you slice it--so get a box today and treat yourself now and then! You'll enjoy it!

review/summary: The Best Cereal in the World!!!
review/text: I have been looking for Frosted Rice Krispies for years.  I finally wrote the Kellogg company and they told me that the Frosted Rice Krispies were still in production I could not believe it. I got hooked on the cereal when I was in Georgia.  I live in Michigan where the cereal is produced and could never find it at any store.  I was sooooo happy to find out it was still being made. I know it is just tons of sugar but eating it in moderation like you do everything else is the key.  I will be getting 4 boxes of Frosted Rice Krispies shipped to me every 3 months thanks to Amazon.

review/text: These taste like regular rice krispies but sweeter, they are good, but actually a little too sweet for me (which I thought was impossible). There is no visible frosting on the cereal, it looks like a normal rice krispie but when you eat it, it's much much sweeter. The taste is great. The frosting taste is like Frosted Flakes. I also don't like how the cereal gets soggy so quickly in milk. Also, don't buy this expecting it to taste like Rice krispie treats cereal.

Don't ask me why or how- but I liked the 1st box. The 2nd box was okay. I threw the last 2 boxes away because I wouldn't eat it. Maybe it was too sweet. Maybe I was hoping for something more like the marshmallow treats....be your own judge. If it's $10ish for a 4 pack- it's worth a try.

review/text: I recently visited Canada where Tim Horton's is huge and I can see why, their brewed coffee is just great! It's bold and has a distinct, rich flavor. I was thrilled to find that I could purchase this from the US and at such a great price, and the coffee tastes just as good as I remember.<br /><br />Not sure how many others do this, but I recently started brewing iced coffee which is done by brewing regular coffee at double strength so it doesn't get too watered down when poured over ice. For that purpose, I find that I still prefer coffee beans I buy from a certain other popular American chain. Can't put my finger on it but I feel like the flavor of Tim Horton's was meant to be appreciated as hot coffee.

review/text: If you ever visit Canada you cannot miss the Ubiquitous Tim Horton's franchises, it seems as if they are on every corner (and small wonder: everything they sell is excellent, reasonably priced, and served with typical Canadian efficiency and politeness.) The quality of Tim Horton's coffee is pretty remarkable -- it is very, very good -- and the price is not outrageous (I picked up a 39 ounce can in a Canadian Walmart for about $16.50 in American dollars toward the end of november, 2010, which was about the same price they were selling for in the Tim Horton's stores.) Note: Their decaf is every bit as good, but I haven't been able to find it in cans larger than 13 ounces.

review/summary: Nice to Find Tim's in the US
review/text: Coffee drinkers from Canada already understand this product.<br /><br />I'm from Canada and now in the US and have searched the US coffee shelves for years for a product I can brew at home that is similar to Tim Horton's coffee.  I've never had any luck finding one.<br /><br />It seems to me that the US coffee market has no shortage of brands that want to be perceived to be at the top end of the coffee market and all of them command a price per pound that makes no sense relative to the quality of their taste and aroma.  Similarly, the bottom end of the market is well represented on supermarket shelves.  Unfortunately they are all largely undrinkable.<br /><br />Tim Horton's coffee owns that space in between.  It is great coffee at an affordable price.  It is also remarkably consistent year over year, something I can't say about Seattle's favorite coffee company.<br /><br />Tim Horton's is a 40 year national phenomenon in Canada and the quality of this coffee is one of the reasons why.

review/summary: Absolutely my favorite coffee out there
review/text: Working 12+ hour days in finance, I am accustomed to drinking a lot of coffee. There is not a better cup out there than Elite Aladin Turkish coffee. I drink it black, but I know the traditional way is to boil it with milk and sugar. No matter how you prefer it, nothing quite packs the punch of Turkish coffee while still delivering a bold (but not overbearing) taste. Each cup reminds me of what it was like to drink that first cup of coffee in my life. You can not go wrong with this at work or at home. I strongly recommend you give it a go.

review/summary: crunchy, good balanced flavor profile
review/text: We sell all the flavors of the Umpqua Oat line at our 2 coffee kiosks and I would say that this is one of the better flavors.  Its a well balanced flavor profile, not too sweet, not too salty. It is filling for a breakfast to go option.  I recommend it, if you definitely like nuts. I like the fact that it has the flax seeds too.

review/summary: Delectable Pralines
review/text: I first tried World Famous Pralines last year at River Street Sweets in Charleston. They were so good I salivated as I anticipated each bite. The rich taste reflects the simple ingredients: sugar, an abundance of incredibly plump pecans, half-and-half, and butter. The praline texture is crumbly--in my opinion, perfect. The only other pralines I'd ever tasted years ago were thin and dense to the point of being hard to chew. I hadn't enjoyed them at all, but maybe preferences in pralines are a regional thing.<br /><br />I've done my best to describe what I've so enjoyed. That first day in the shop my sisters and I were so excited we ordered pralines for our mother. I've since ordered them for myself and for friends and other members of my family. Everyone I know has raved about these pralines.<br /><br />Note: The pralines don't have preservatives. They have a 21-day shelf life, part of which is taken up in shipping. Plan on eating--no, devouring!--them within 14-18 days.

review/summary: I'm a Pay Day Convert!
review/text: My candy bar of choice used to be Snickers � I still like them but I prefer less chocolate these days.  Hence, Pay Day is the chocolate-free Snickers bar!  I enjoy the wonderful combo of the sweet chewiness of the caramel and the salty crunch of the peanuts in the Pay Day bar.  I find it satisfies my sweet tooth craving and actually gives me some nutrition.

review/summary: My favorite candy can also be a substitute for trail mix. Really????
review/text: Okay, so candy isn't health food. The ingredients would send my doctor into lecture mode. BUT, to me PayDay candy bars are a great substitute for trail mix on some of my moderate hiking treks, and an addition on longer hikes.<br /><br />Obviously I'm not a nutritionist, and my logic may be faulty, but I've been using PayDays for just such hikes during the past hot summer months. After 4 miles of climbing some "moderate" to downright difficult hills and trails, I need an energy boost. I also want to retain water which, with borderline high blood pressure, definitely seems counter-intuitive. PayDays have just the right amount of salt to accomplish the latter, and the nuts and sugar definitely give ME a boost.<br /><br />I start hiking when the temp is around 70, and in these hills, that can be 90 in a couple of hours. You really need salt, though I admonish anyone reading this to drink a lot of water as well.<br /><br />If my logic is indeed faulty - even if it has worked well for me - then give me credit for finding a positive reason for having my favorite candy bar with me "just in case."<br /><br />The only negative is that the price just went up $5, and it's fast approaching the very expensive "health bars." But it's still less than cocoanut covered carrot cake where you'll die from choking if not dehydration.

review/text: The candy bars were fresh, and affordable.  Its not easy to find a candy bar, that doesn't contain chocolate. Paydays are great, when you want a snack, and its nice having a box of them around the house.  I bought these 6 months ago, and I still have a couple candy bars left, so they last awhile.  I'd recommend these to anyone who enjoys Payday candy bars.

review/summary: Chia Seeds Are Very Healthy - Cautions for Men though
review/text: WARNING: While Chia seeds are known to have many health benefits, some studies show that chia, like flax seed, can cause prostate problems with men. My husband has seen the bad side affects of flax seed (swollen prostate), but none from chia yet. Some studies suggest not just swelling, but cancer is a risk for men. I'm not fully convinced chia seeds can cause prostate cancer (in the quantity we eat them) but this is something you may want to consider if you're a man or cooking for a man. I'm doing more and more research on it and will update here if I find out more.<br /><br />Chia seeds are considered to be very healthy and can be added to just about any foods & recipes (tastes a little like nutty cracked pepper). I usually buy Spectrum and Nutiva brand but I also trust Bob's Red Mill. They all offer quality products. I have never got a "bad" or rancid batch of chia seeds from any of these companies and have purchased from all of them for many years. I've purchased Bob's and Spectrum chia locally and Nutiva chia here on Amazon.com. If you can't get Bob's Red Mill locally I would recommend you go through Amazon since I use Amazon for hundreds of purchases and customer service is always great.<br /><br />The price of Chia Seeds has gone up as much as 300% (most brands) in the last 18 months due to popularity and is expected to rise even more very soon. This Spectrum 12 oz bag seems to be the lowest price I've seen on Amazon lately. Personally I'm going to stock up since the prices are going so high so fast. If you want to eat chia daily I advise others do the same if you can afford to. Waiting will most likely just mean you'll pay more later. They can be frozen for long term storage, or vacuum sealed.<br /><br />I add chia seeds to my husbands meat dishes to give him the added nutrients and antioxidants he does not get otherwise.<br />I add chia to just about all foods I eat, just a little in everything. I sprinkle them over Salads and Veggies like cracked pepper.<br /><br />I've added Chia Seeds to the following recipes/foods with great results:<br />Oatmeal<br />Meat Loaf & Meatballs (regular meat or tofu)<br />Sauces & Gravies<br />Baked Cakes, Cookies, Muffins, Pastries<br />Ice Creams, Sherbets, Sorbets<br />Smoothies<br />Soups<br />Scrambled Eggs & Omelets<br />Bread Crumbs<br /><br />Use just a little and you can barely taste them (good for a start).<br />Use a bit more and it will have a nutty peppery flavor.<br />For example, I have to mix at least 1/2 cup of Chia seeds per 7 pounds of ground meat before my husband will even begin to taste it.<br />Keep in mind the idea of eating Chia seeds is not so much for the flavor as it is for the nutrients.<br /><br />If you grind the Chia seeds to a powder (using a coffer grinder or similar) this will release the nutrients and give you more benefit from them.<br /><br />Studies have shown adding Chia seeds to your daily diet can help fight cancer, boost your immune system, and flush toxins from your body.<br /><br />For those who want to (or need to) eat a grain-free diet, Chia seeds are not considered to be a true "cereal" grain, and therefore is an acceptable "grain" or seed to eat if you're on a Paleo or similar diet.<br /><br />Chia seeds are high in protein (it's a complete protein), omega 3 fatty acids, calcium, boron (for bone health), fiber, potassium, and antioxidants.

So far, I've used it in baking (e.g. cookies, cake) and smoothies. Doesn't alter the taste in any form since the seed is tiny. As for whether I have more energy, I haven't noticed any additional energy since I've been using it.<br /><br />The pack I received has an expiration date of 2014 in case you might wondering.

review/summary: Changed my mind
review/text: I purchased this product for its caffeine-free profile and the fact that rooibos is supposed to have so many health benefits (asthma/allergy relief.)  I just didn't care for it.  I'm sure there is an audience for it out there, it's drinkable, there just isn't anything special about it and it felt like work to get it down.  I drink a lot of tea, lots of choices on my shelf, and I reach right past this product and choose something else. You have to buy four tins at a time which is a shame because life is too short to spend it drinking unsatisfying tea.<br /><br />12-31-2010<br />I still think this tea is rater blah but you know, it sort of grows on you and I have to say I felt better when I was drinking a couple of cups a day. I got used to and looked forward to the simple nature of it.  By the time I ran out I noticed that I was sleeping better, my breathing was better and so was my general sense of well being.  This brand was not available so I ordered another brand of loose rooibos tea and all I can say is I wish the Caranda brand was back in stock.

Don't quote me on this, but I think it's actually healthier too. Haribo is the best.

OMG that this Italian seasoning tastes good. We just love it. It even has a hint of parmessan cheese that ads more flavor to the italian food you prepare. I hardly recommend it, but be careful if you don't like spicy food because it is a little bit spicy, but not too much.
