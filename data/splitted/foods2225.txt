review/summary: DO NOT BUY NATURA PRODUCTS FOR DOGS AND CATS!!
review/text: I put my cat on Evo for 2 years, she got a urinary tract infection.I had to change her food. Right after I changed her food. I found out Evo is terrible for animals, the food is causing alot of health problems and death.I got a letter in the mail stating there is a lawsuit against Innova Evo plus all Natura products.I'm currently in the lawsuit myself.. Evo lied about the ingredients in all their products...DO NOT BUY EVO AND NATURA PRODUCTS!!! (such as Innova Evo, California Natural, Healthwise, Mother Nature, and Karma Dog)Google it, it's called PetproductsSettlement.com.. It's for a $2,150,000 settlement

review/summary: Great Tasting, Great Texture, Lots o' Fiber and terribly overpriced
review/text: This is the great cereal of my childhood (which used to be produced in a town named "Wheatenaville", honest!  It has tons of fiber and a nutty taste and really stick-to-the-ribs breakfast.  Even my little 18 month old grandson loves it.<br /><br />Glad I could find it at Amazon.  However, one caveat: the price that its sold at plus shipping makes this a gourmet indulgence indeed.  Buyer, beware.  You've gotta love it to buy it.  However, I bought a case of it anyway.

review/summary: Wheatena ROCKS, especially in winter !!!
review/text: The product specs describe it enough and so have the other reviewers. It's a HOT  breakfast cereal. Best to add just a pinch (not more) of salt when you cook it to bring out all the flavor. When done, add milk (I like it just right, not too thick and not too runny) then a dash of sugar (or some Splenda). Especially on a cold winter day, you have yourself one of the healthiest cereals around. For sure!

It has an interesting and, to me, unusual texture in which the grains are quite distinct (but so small that they aren't "chewy") and a distinct wheaty texture.  It's hard to find in stores now, at least in Idaho, but it's well worth the effort to get it from Amazon.  And it also does well as a cooked grain in bread!

review/summary: Hard to find, worth the price
review/text: None of the large grocery chains in CA carry Wheatena any more. The small chain at which I used to buy it no longer carries it. The on-line price is higher than other hot cereals but (one exception) none can compare for combination of flavor, fiber, texture and healthfulness. It knocks the spots off big sellers like Cream of Wheat. I have been eating and enjoying Wheatena for 70 years and counting. Only real competition is steel-cut oatmeal, Scottish style--and that's equally expensive.

The vanilla flavor is as strong as the lemon but seems to alternate with it.  It is chewy and taste fresh.  IT is a nice healthy gluten-free alternative that I would recomend.  It contains prebiotics to support digestion and is a good source of Omega 3 fatty acids (550 mg per bar!)

review/text: These bars have a pleasantly mild taste, lemony without being overpowering, and a chewy texture without being sticky, thanks to the sesame and flax seeds covering them.  They're less filling than the Larabars I also love, but also milder in flavor, and they stand up better to being stowed away for days (or weeks) in a pocket or in the bottom of my purse, just in case I need a gluten-free snack.  There really isn't anything I don't like about these - will order more as soon as they become available again.

Bully sticks keep him occupied. the problem i was having is the expense. Petco sells 12" bully sticks for $12.99 each so it gets VERY expensive to keep buying them however with the price offered through Amazon its much more affordable. I truly have no complaints about the product or seller i was satisfied with both!

review/text: My Havanese loves these 'chewies' when we cut them in half. They are tough to cut - you have to score them with a sharp knife and then break them against a solid sharp corner (like the edge of a countertop). These Bully Sticks do not smell at all that I have ever noticed, even when she's happily chewing away right next to me. They last a long time, and are the right size for her little mouth. I think they are great and I'm ordering my 2nd bunch of them right now.

review/summary: Amazing, healthy choice for a finicky, IBS kitty!
review/text: I adopted Layla as an older cat (~7yrs), and she had chronic diarrhea and was underweight, but also a finicky eater. My vet prescribed special IBS canned food, which Layla hated with a passion, so in an effort to coax her to eat, I would let her eat cheap gravy food (the only food she kind of liked) along with shredded chicken I would cook. This was either hit or miss with her, and I frequently ended up wasting food because she either flat-out refused to eat it or wouldn't eat all of it. Even with frequent vet visits and medicine, Layla proceeded to get sicker with her IBS, and out of desperation, I ordered the Paw Lickin' Chicken along with some other flavors. Layla absolutely adores it!!!! It looks and smells like human food, and is clearly high quality (it looks exactly like the picture). The other cheaper food would sometimes make me gag at its consistency and the poor quality of the meat, but Weruva is wonderful! It is high in water content, so I know Layla is staying hydrated, and it's also so easy to wash out of the bowl, unlike gravy food or pate. The other thing I've noticed is that Layla doesn't need as much food to stay satiated. She eats about three 3.0 ounce cans a day, and has no problem with grazing on them throughout the day, which she wouldn't do with the other food.<br /><br />Economically speaking, yes, Weruva is a more expensive food ounce for ounce, but the money I save on waste actually makes Weruva cheaper for me. Plus, when you compare the price to the quality of the food you receive, Weruva is a far better purchase than the more popular high-end cat food (which cost the same). However, the most important point is that I now have a very happy cat without IBS symptoms, who is finally gaining weight, and this is priceless to me =).

review/summary: EGG WHITES are not recommended for babies under a year old
review/text: My 10 month old daughter is eating chunky foods such as this and table foods that are appropriate for her. This Gerber lasagna with meat sauce states that it is appropriate for crawlers (babies usually crawl way before hitting the one year mark).  Yet in the ingredients states that it contains egg whites, which are not recommended for babies under a year old.  I'm glad I read the label before serving it to her!  I asked my daughter's pediatrician at her 9 month check up about this and was told never to give a baby egg whites in any form, until after a year, as it is known to trigger severe allergic reactions.  Otherwise, I love Gerber 3rd Stage foods for my 10 month old, she gobbles them up.  But we will hold off on this flavor until she's a year old.

review/summary: Dull colors
review/text: I was bitterly disappointed with this product.  The blue tends towards grayish- not a vibrant color.  The yellow is quite nice.  The red is basically brown.  You can't mix it with anything and it looks awful on its own.  My son's "under the sea" birthday cupcakes came out with grayish frosting instead of blue and the batch of peppermint cookies that I just tried to turn pink came out beige.  I'll have to stick to making yellow items I guess...

review/text: I planned to make rainbow cake in a jar for my son's first birthday.  The colors were not vibrant like regular food color, but were pretty and rich.  At least in the uncooked cake batter.  But when the cakes came out of the oven, there was no trace of color at all.  It looked like I had just baked regular yellow cake with no dye whatsoever.  I was so so sad to be serving plain cake in a jar.

review/summary: Nice Croutons!
review/text: We bought a few bags at a local grocery outlet for $0.25/bag.  The first bags we bought were close to their shelf date (which is why low price), but we really liked them and they were nice and crispy.  So we bought several more (same price).  The ones tonight have a shelf date of Sep 2011, so I'm not sure why the food outlet had them, but I'm not complaining -- these are good croutons.

review/text: So like the other reviewer said, the taste is strange. I didn't consider them to be chemical tasting, just a very weak mint taste. I bought them on a 4 hour drive so that I wouldn't have to stop and use the restroom like I would if I was drinking a caffeinated (sp?) drink. I have small kids and they usually fall asleep on the drive and if I stop, they wake up.<br /><br />As far as the taste goes, they are better than a cold coffee or lukewarm energy drink, which is what you're going to get on a long drive.<br /><br />I would recommend them.

review/text: I am the only coffee drinker in my family of five.  And I am not a die hard coffee drinker at that.  For years I've been trying to coerce someone else in the family to drink coffee w/ me so that my coffee maker can be brought out of the cabinet at least occasionally.  Fortunately, my teen daughter agreed to drink coffee w/ me if I would buy this Chocolate Velvet, which we found in a local grocery store.  She loved it, and now we enjoy heating up the pot every morning.  This coffee is a medium roast with just a hint of chocolate.  Very smooth flavor.  We enjoy it w/ sugar and half 'n' half.  Well worth a try, especially if you can get a small sample bag.  Just noticed that Amazon offers this flavor in decaf, so I will be switching to that when our current bag is gone.  Probably won't be long!

I've tried the fancy machines with K-cups, a French press, a Chemex glass drip coffee maker and espresso makers but I always come back to this brand.  All the flavors are good, I like the Hazelnut too.  I have this on Subscribe & Save here on Amazon.com and the price really rocks.  I'm a cream and sugar gal but this is good enough to drink black - okay, I'm exaggerating but not by much.

review/text: "Millstone's Chocolate Velvet" is a mellow coffee with a delicious mild chocolate flavor. The Arabica coffee beans are hand picked and dried in the sun. They are then shipped to America where a master roaster roasts them to perfection. This coffee is just flavored enough to enhance the coffee flavor and doesn't overpower the natural flavor. I always buy this for special occasions and then end up drinking it all up! I don't drink a lot of coffee as I'm more of a tea person but this is one of my favorites.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Because local retailers are constantly changing the flavors & varieties of coffee that they stock, purchasing on Amazon is a reliable option at a very competitive price.

review/text: Ah, Millstone entered our lives when the Super W moved in across the street from our house. $9 bucks for a bag of coffee?!?! I got so upset with my husband for choosing the most expensive coffee offered at the store. Then I would smell him brew it in the morning - delicious! I was not a coffee drinker until I had Millstone Chocolate Velvet. I have a cup of either this flavor or the Hazelnut Cream. We take ours with International Delight's Hazelnut Creamer. I add some splenda because I like things sweeeet. I've tried drinking it black which I can't do, but I'm sure others could if you're used to it. I just wish Amazon would carry the whole bean variety of this. I buy the whole bean Hazelnut and it really makes a difference to grind the coffee fresh before drinking. 5 stars and a couple mugs of this a day to Millstone!

review/text: For those of us who love our chocolate, this is a dream come true!  For one, Millstone's coffee is probably the smoothest, most richest coffee I've ever tried to date and believe me, I've tried TONS of them!  When our local grocery store here in Ohio decided to carry this well, he has an EXTREME amount of difficulty keeping it in stock.  If it's out and you ask when it's coming back in, you usually get, "you ladies and your chocolate!"  Honestly, it's really that good so be sure to grab some for yourself to try.  If you think it sounds nasty, don't.  You'll really miss quite the treat if you do.  If you want to make yourself half sick, then be sure to add some Mint Chocolate Truffle cream by International Coffee (I could go on for days here, being the queen of desserts that I am but well, brevity needs to be in order...)!  Golly, is that EVER awesome! This coffee also comes in decaffeinated which my sister is quite happy about too!  Highly, highly recommend!

With every OTHER chocolate-flavored coffee, I'm wondering either "where is the darn chocolate flavor??" or "they think THIS tastes like CHOCOLATE?", but not with this one.  I drink mine with light cream, and that really seems to make it taste more chocolatey.  It's been my coffee of choice for years now, much longer than any other brand/flavor of coffee.  I especially appreciate it on Monday mornings when it helps blunt the pain of beginning another work week.  If you like chocolate, try it!  You'll like it!

My observation was that this coffee had a terrific scent, not only successful in making me downright hungry when I brewed it, but fetching many positive comments from people at work. If I didn't know any better, I'd have assumed I was brewing hot chocolate. When it was all said and done, however, I thought the overall taste was just OK. Not at all bad - after all, I only drink black coffee, but perhaps my tastebuds are just defective and I require more than a medium bodied flavor. On another note, I think it lent itself well on those weekend mornings when I felt like pouring in a splash of Jameson.

review/summary: One of the Best Coffees by one of the Nicest Coffee Companies
review/text: Out of all the coffee companies out there, I've probably been the most loyal to Millstone Coffee Company. Since 2001, I've been drinking Millstone Coffee Company coffees. In my opinion, they're honestly one of the nicest companies out there. In 2001, one of the few and rare times I entered an online contest/sweepstakes, I won second prize in Millstone's "Gourmet Getaway Weekend" sweepstakes. They gave me a Capresso Coffee Grinder and a package of their Foglifter coffee. I still have that Capresso Coffee Grinder in my kitchen. Honestly, Millstone's coffees do stand out. They're smooth, rich-tasting, and bold. And you truly get what you pay for with these coffee products. My co-workers and I have tried the majority of their products over the years ranging from Chocolate Velvet, Foglifter, French Vanilla, French Roast, Kona Blend, Caramel Truffle, Hazelnut Cream, Pumpkin Spice, etc. Millstone Coffee Company stay very true to the flavors they advertise on their coffee products. When you buy their Caramel Truffle - you taste the caramel. When you buy their Hazelnut Cream - you taste the hazelnut. When you buy their Pumpkin Spice - you taste the pumpkin. And of course, when you buy their Chocolate Velvet - you taste the chocolate. My co-workers and I have tried many coffees from many coffee brands over the years. And out of all the coffees out there that advertise "chocolate" flavor - Millstone, according to my opinion and my co-workers' opinions, are truly the most honest in advertising their "chocolate" flavor. You really do taste the chocolate in their Chocolate Velvet coffee. For example, I bought a bag of Godiva Chocolatier's Chocolate Truffle coffee a few months ago, and my co-workers and I were honestly very disappointed each time we made Godiva Chocolatier's Chocolate Truffle coffee. It didn't matter how strong we made the coffee - we didn't taste chocolate at all. My family, co-workers, and I think that Godiva Chocolatier make excellent and innovative chocolate candies and baked goods. I also think that Godiva Chocolatier's Lady Godiva 2011 mug they're currently selling online by New York artists Kurt Huggins and Zelda Devon is a beautiful and unique mug that many coffee drinkers would like to add to their coffee mug/tea cup collection. In my honest opinion, that Lady Godiva 2011 mug screams "Lady Gaga", and if I met Lady Gaga I would definitely give her that Lady Godiva 2011 mug as a gift because that mug just reminds me of her and I know that Lady Gaga loves all things New York-related, and New York-based designers created that mug. Really, I think that the Godiva Chocolatier company should send Lady Gaga that mug along with some of their hot chocolate. Anyways, if you want my complete honesty, if there is any Godiva Chocolatier product that needs improvement, it's their coffee. Really, out of all the companies out there, my co-workers and I thought that Godiva Chocolatier would make the best chocolate-flavored coffee, but it ends up that Millstone Coffee Company make the best chocolate-flavored coffee. Who knew? My verdict: Millstone Coffee Company make the best chocolate-flavored coffee - Chocolate Velvet. In general, they are truly one of the best coffee companies out there. And I hope that the Millstone Coffee Company make more flavored coffees in the future. To Millstone Coffee Company, if you're reading this - My co-workers and I have drank your coffees for more than a decade now. We have tried almost every coffee you have produced and made. We want more! Please make some new flavored coffees - we would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

review/text: I was shopping for some royal jelly and ran across this product. I did some research on the properties of propolis as I had never heard of it before and I was amazed at the properties of this natural bee product. I then heard from some local Chumash indians that they use raw honey as a first aid antiseptic and in many healing salves for scrapes, burns and skin disorders with great success.<br /><br />I had bought a couple of extra jars for friends and relatives, and I gave one of my extra jars to a dear friend who is suffering from colitis due to Clostridium difficile (also called C. difficile). She had already had a round of antibiotics, but her symptoms returned as soon as she finished her prescription. She was given a second round of antibiotics and on the second day of antibiotics she broke into hives, so she stopped. Within a week of taking the Super Enriched Honey, her symptoms have improved, and she will continue taking the super enriched honey for a while. She is also taking probiotics to re-populate her digestive system with the good bacteria. The combination of these two natural protocols may be the answer to her problem.<br /><br />This does not constitute medical advice, and I am not not encouraging anyone to disregard or substitute this information for that of a medical doctor, I needed to simply talk about my personal anecdotal experience with this product. I found my personal levels of energy to be much more even, and the simple knowledge of doing something to improve my personal health has had a positive effect on my general sense of well being.

review/text: This is one of the best hot sauces I ever ate. the habenaro flavor came through heat was just right not for the meek. Just a bit too high on the price for what it is. If I found it in a store I would buy it again cost with shipping way too much, Maybe combine shipping for orders like I had made would keep people ordering on line. I would, Thanks for the flavor.

I don't know where they get the figure $85.05 but nobody sells this water for $3.54 for a bottle, not even a high-end restaurant.

review/summary: Excellent, But The Cost is Too High.
review/text: San Diego tap water smells a bit and leaves a lot of white crud in the glass if evaporated dry. But, what the hey? Why should I buy supplemental minerals if Colorado River water already contains a good variety? In any case, the city says it's safe and I know of no problems. Well, my wife feels differently about such matters. She's from Europe and nobody there supposedly drinks tap water. Disgusting. Drinking water must come in a bottle and be collected from some important and well-known springs. Besides, she seems to have elevated senses in taste, smell, sight, hearing and all other senses. In any case, to keep peace in the household, I agreed that we would drink bottled water. We gradually settled in on Kirkland Signature bottled water. The price was right! Well, now even that isn't good enough. My wife seems to have discovered Fiji Natural Artesian Water which comes in attractive rectangular bottles and is imported all the way from the South Pacific. It costs several times as much as regular brands, but that's part of the appeal. It's the best, she claims. It's so smooth and goes down so easy, she says. Now other bottled waters, although OK, are not nearly as good. No, Fiji Natural Artesian Water is the water for her. I must admit that it's excellent, but the cost is way too high.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Great water but can be ordered for much cheaper elsewhere
review/text: FIJI is great water. I can truly taste a difference between FIJI and other typical bottled water brands. The difference is the natural mineral content that is removed from store-brand waters that simply purify municipal tap water. My only complaint is that you can get this water much cheaper by ordering direct from FIJI's web page so why pay nearly double to buy it on amazon.com?

Thank you, FIJI ISLANDS.  The water is delivered directly to the consumers home. If you, the consumer, select the standard shipping for a few more days (5 to 8 days) for delivery, there is no shipping charge.  So, because of the weight of the product, that is what you need to select. Plus, I would recommend ordering more than one case at a time. SAVES the consumer alot of money!!!!! Enjoy the water!!!! It is very good for you. Thank you, FIJI ISLANDS & (amazon)

review/summary: Excellent basic espresso
review/text: While there are lots of small coffee roasters whose espressos I enjoy, this is truly a good basic everyday espresso.  Espressos should be dark and full bodied. This one is rich and flavorful.  It makes a nice crema.<br /><br />It is also good for using in a countertop espresso machine. We have a Jura Capressa E8 Super Automatic.  A lot of the flavored coffees and roasts that are too dark gum up the system and make it sluggish.  And while it is not a big deal to change the grinder, it is probably better to use a bean the machine likes.

It has a weak flavor and flat finish.  The crema is good, but that just tells us that there's a lot of robusto beans in it. To me it tastes like supermarket quality coffee. If you look on their website it doesn't even tell you what the blend is. I would not recommend buying this blend.

review/summary: Great espresso bean
review/text: Great bean for espresso (hence the name)!  On a rancilio rocky and silvia, the bean can taste anywhere between bright to chocolaty and rich.  I am still a bit inconsistent with my shots and haven't quite gotten a good handle on the temperature characteristics of my machine yet, but I am happy enough with this bean that I expect to use it for a while.  Price is competitive when compared to fresh-roasted beans, which may or may not influence your decision.  However, the downsides are that the beans are not freshly roasted, which does make quite a bit of a difference in crema and taste, in my opinion.  Additionally, the beans will lose even more freshness after you open the bag and try to get through 2.2 lbs of the stuff (even if you put it in an airtight container, as I do).  However, its a great bean that I am happy with.

review/text: My son worked as a barista at our local $tarbucks for two years.<br />He is 25 this next month and still lives at home....though attending college...so he has a temporary reprieve from being shoved out of the nest.<br />He works 'occasionally' and does not contribute what we feel is an adequate amount towards living here...<br />so I have taken advantage of his 'professional' training as a barista  as part of the trade off of his still living here.<br /> HOW NICE TO HAVE MY OWN PRIVATE BARISTA !  :)<br />I was looking for COFFEE SYRUP, made from coffee to use in coffee based beverages and in other cooking.  In the past, I have made my own home-made flavored liquers so knew we could come up with our own COFFEE flavored syrup (just without the alcohol which can be added at any time).<br />A rich and bold espresso is ideal for the flavoring, and this whole bean LAVAZZA Top Class ESPRESSO fit the bill perfectly!<br />My son coarsely grinds the beans and brews at a high coffee to water ratio, strains and adds to simple syrup of sugar and water that we cook various lengths of time depending on how thick (and caramelized) we want the syrup.<br />SUCCESS and, though it may be hard to believe that a simple syrup made at home can taste 'fresh' compared to commercially bottled, THIS really does!<br />COFFEE NIRVANA :)<br />We made ours thick enough, that, it is like a thick (more boiled down) maple syrup and was heavenly when added to a frappe AND then, drizzled over the whipped cream we placed on top of the frappe.<br />So, I highly recommended the LAVAZZA Espresso 'espressly' for this purpose.  Also good ground for my Biallita stovetop Moka coffee brewer and other methods of brewing.

review/summary: Hit or miss with this one in the long run
review/text: Updated:<br /><br />I had left a great review for this product back in 2011. The first batch I bought brewed very green and had the tasty/potent "vegetal" or "grassy" smell and taste.<br />Months later, after getting my second shipment of the 64ct packs, I found the tea never had quite the taste of the first batch. It was more bitter and not quite as green but just "okay".<br />After that shipment I tried some loose tea directly from Takaokaya, which turned out to be good overall.<br /><br />Now after my recent purchase of the 64ct packs for the third time, I have hit rock bottom with the product. The tea that I just purchased is not even the slightest bit green, but completely yellow. The tea hasn't the slightest hint of the vegetal/grassy taste, and just tastes bland. It actually tastes worse than the cheap stuff you buy at local stores.<br /><br />But anyways I believe there could be other factors that played into it, as maybe the tea had been sitting in some warehouse for months getting overheated and dried out due to high temperature, but who really knows.<br /><br />Initially, I found excellent value in this tea, but I would never purchase it from Amazon.com again. If you purchase their tea you might be better off buying it directly from the Takaokaya website.

review/summary: My dogs love the Greenies, and I like Amazon's price...
review/text: I am an enabler.  My two dogs have an insatiable addiction to Greenies.  Every night around 8:45 p.m., they start whining, barking, and circling me... and they don't stop until they each get a Greenie for the day.  If you're a consistent buyer of Greenies like me, you know that it can get very expensive-- at the local chain pet store I can expect to pay $17.99 per bag of Greenies (12 oz., 43 teenie pieces).<br /><br />Which leads me to review Amazon's performance in delivering these doggie treats at a reasonable price; currently it's $15.99 per bag and if you buy 3 bag you get one for free.  In addition to this, there's free shipping which saves me time and a needless trip down to the pet store.  If you buy 4 bags, you're getting it for about $12 per bag, which is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />In terms of the snacks themselves, the senior version of these Teenie Greenies are great-- they taste just as great as the original (based on my dogs' ability to consume it in under 3 minutes) but they have a softer consistency.  One of my dogs is nearly 18 years old, while the other is 9 years old... so dental care and not stressing out their teeth is really important to me.<br /><br />As long as Amazon maintains this deal, I'll continue to purchase the item directly from them.

Senior Greenies saved the day!  He loves the taste.  I cut them into tiny slices so one treat lasts longer.  Keeping an older dog's teeth clean can be a challenge, especially if they aren't able to eat really crunchy food or gnaw on rawhides or bones.  Senior Greenies can help!

review/text: My elderly Pomeranian LOVES these Senior Greenies (even more than regular greenies) and absolutely never lets us forget this 4 o'clock daily treat (I never have been able to fully understand how dogs tell time, but we all know they are VERY good at it--and surprisingly accurate).<br /><br />These are a little bit softer than regular greenies & they contain both chondroitin (sp?) and glucosamine for joint support.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Better Breath
review/text: I think these are working and making our dog's breath tolerable.  Because there is a risk to our dog in having her teeth cleaned, she'll get one of these a day as a treat.  She loves them!
