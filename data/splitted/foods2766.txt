review/summary: Fresh and delicious!
review/text: I bought this because I'm trying to eat more healthy, natural snacks.  I hate how the dried fruit in stores is so sweetened and mushy so I searched elsewhere and found this.<br /><br />The fruit was soft and fresh.  The almonds and pistachios were some of the best I've ever had with just the right amount of salt.  I didn't try the coconut date rolls, and I wasn't a fan of the dates, but that's personal preference.  My boyfriend and I devoured the rest of it in a couple days.  The little wooden box can be reused for just about anything and is also great packaging if this is to be given as a gift.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to any dried fruit lover!

review/summary: Yuuch!!
review/text: This product was terrible. We got the Mother's Day basket, it was dry, tasteless and tough. I don't know if all of Golden State's stuff is so bad, but ours was terrible. We are from California, we know what good dried fruit is supposed to taste and feel like. The fruit was highly treated with sulfites, and very dry and tough. It was tasteless, so I am certain it was at least two years old. I am surprised at all of the good reviews for this product, perhaps we have higher standards. It was good for compost, but I was afraid there were too many chemicals in it.

review/text: The feedback I got for the quality of this product was fabulous.  The problem was that they sent me an email that they had shipped all three of my orders out on December 12th.  It turns out they only shipped one.  I kept waiting for my friends to say something and didn't want to appear rude and ask about it.  Finally, I got an email that the remaining two orders, which had supposedly already been sent (confirmed by a second email, not the first order confirmation) were in fact being sent ground UPS on December 23rd.  This was outrageous.  Miraculously, they both arrived by the 24th but it was only because of the diligence of UPS.  This company almost screwed my Christmas.

review/summary: Nothing Special, Just OK taste. Big Mess
review/text: I bought this bar at Whole Foods, thinking that it must be amazing, especially for the price. I also liked that the founder, Katrina, had started her flavor expedition in Spain. I expected the flavor to be unique and exotic, much like my first bite of Haagen Daz Mayan Chocolate ice cream. The flavor was fine, but not any better than your average Fair Trade chocolate bar. I also found the squares difficult to break clean on the lines, thus leaving a huge mess of caramel all over. I would recommend this bar if you specifically needed a messy chocolate with ok flavor. I will, however, try the other flavors before giving up on Katrina and the Vosges.

review/summary: Perfect substitute for cow's milk without the scariness of soy
review/text: I sought out this product when I realized my toddler was allergic to cow's mlk. As my child is a boy, I was concerned about the effects of non-fermented soy and the plant estrogens that soy milk contains. There was not another acceptable nutritional alternative- hemp and flax contain practically nothing in terms of protein. This actually has 4g protein per serving and 30% DV of calcium. I combined it with coconut milk and it made a doctor-approved whole milk substitute.<br />The flavor is slightly sweet, but the product does not contain additional sugar, another plus. The only con is the cost, and amazon is about the cheapest way to get it.

For day trips in the car this is fine, but this stinks for airplane travel.  I have tried to serve him the single serve of rice milk, but he simply will not drink as much as this.  He loves it!

review/summary: Love the product, hate the shipping
review/text: Love the Oat milk; hate the shipping charges.<br />This oat beverage is delicious and has helped in lowering my cholesterol.  Back last October, I got my cholesterol lab test back, I had 201.  Okay, not so bad, but not so good either.  Knowing that oats do lower cholesterol, I ordered a couple of boxes from Amazon -they don't have any left to sell directly, only through third-party vendors and the shipping charge is horrendous! I drank one container every day during the day instead of water, and when I had made room inside the container, I added more water to it.  I followed this regime every day for about three months without many more changes to my diet.  I got another cholesterol test done, the result was 178.  Feeling encouraged, I continued drinking my oat drink every day.  Three months later when I tested my cholesterol again, it was 152.  Now, one problem oats do not address in regards to the cholesterol is the ratio of good to bad cholesterol.  In my case, the ratio is no good.  I have more bad cholesterol than good one, and although my overall number has gone down, I still have more bad cholesterol than good one.  This problem has to be addressed in a different way; my doctor suggests prescriptions like Lipitor, etc.  I'm not so ready to get into that yet.  I'm trying a couple of natural alternatives before I'm tested again.<br /><br />Conclusion: the drink is delicious, it does help to lower your cholesterol but not the bad cholesterol.  The killer is the shipping!!  The shipping costs very much what the box of product costs or a bit more.  I now buy the oat milk from my local grocery store or a health food store. Price ranges between $2.40 to $2.80 per container, it depends to where you go.

review/text: The package and description of this coffee fools me. From the look of it, I would imagine that it tastes like European coffe like aromatic strong dark but not sour or bitter like French roast. Well, this coffee tasted very bad base on my opinion, it is sour with no pure fresh coffee taste and it is a little stinky! My aunt visited us from France several months back where she brought over some instant coffe which I forgot the name, but this coffee is awsome tasting very close to fresh French roast slow drip brew. I'll post the brand when I remember the name. Tell me if I am wrong if you've had this Bustelo supreme before.

review/summary: Easier to digest than beef rawhide and dog just as happy!
review/text: I have a black Toy Poodle that has been chewing on beef rawhide bones practically since the day he was born.  However, his tummy always got a little upset from it and I heard the pork is easier for them to digest, so I switched to these Pork Chomps.  He loves them just as much (if not more) and now his tummy is more settled.  Plus, just like all-natural beef rawhides they do not stink or break into smaller pieces or discolor my blankets/sofa, like many other kinds of treats/bones .  They are odorless, they have no color and they stay in one piece until eaten in full.  Conclusion:  They ROCK!!!  My other "can't-do-without" dog supplement is called "Missing Link."  That product is A-MA-ZING as well and, along with a diet FREE of grain/flour/soy/sugar/preservatives, it has completely stopped him from scratching himself and knawing on his paws).

review/summary: Crystal Light Pure Grape Flavor
review/text: In an effort to become healthier, I quit drinking soda, which sucks.  Because I like soda.  So instead of drinking plain water, I've looked into flavor packets to make things a little more interesting.  The problem though, is that most contain artificial sweeteners, which is part of the reason I quit drinking soda in the first place.  So I've sought out those flavor packets that have natural sweeteners, and the Pure brand by Crystal Light is one of those.<br /><br />Crystal Light Pure uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners.  So it ranks pretty high in my book in terms of ingredients.  Sure there's a few hard to pronounce ingredients in the list, but it is a relatively small list compared to a lot of things anymore, and its still better than soda.  It also contains natural sugar, which is ok to me too, even if it is the first listed ingredient.  I do like that they used purple carrot and hibiscus flower extracts for color, instead of using an artificial dye.  Because I worried about that when I first saw the dark purple color the water turned after adding the powder.  Although it was a pretty color.<br /><br />The flavor, to be honest, kind of tasted like that fake grape flavor they have in candy.  It was recognizable as grape, but not the taste of "real" grapes.  Even though it had natural flavor in it.  But it was still good.  And the flavor was strong when adding to a regular sized bottle of water.  I prefer my drinks stronger though so that was perfectly to my liking, those who don't will probably only need half a packet to flavor their water.<br /><br />I'd buy these again.  And I'll try out other drink flavorings from the Pure Brand.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Great with alfredo
review/text: I bought it because my daughter wanted to eat little tennis rackets.  I served it al-dente with sun-dried tomato alfredo with rendered genovetta hot salami.  I have made the same dish numerous times before but usually with Barilla's Pipette Rigate.  The Racchette shape provides excellent hold for the sauce, much like Rotelle, but it holds much more because of the smaller spaces.

review/summary: ok, but...
review/text: I love seaweed and have tried many brands, but was new to this one.  This product is ok, but it has it's issues.  First, the flavor is ok, but the texture is so brittle it just crumbles as you try to take it out of the package.  Second the size is inconvenient.  Each sheet is about 7x8", not a good size for eating.  Not really good for holding as it's too large and just keeps crumbling making quite a mess.  I think a child could only get a few bites before the rest was on the floor.  The pkg comes w/5 sheets, so if you use only one or 2, the others will go stale really quickly.  The serving size is 1/2 a package and that's a good sized serving, with only 24 calories.  However, 22 of those calories are fat.  Interesting how different seaweeds have such different calorie, fat and carb counts.  Go figure.  I think the price is also a little high, but I don't know if that's the retail price or the Amazon price.  Overall the product is ok, but you can do better.

review/summary: Bad Batch?
review/text: We've had several other brands of seaweed snacks and always enjoyed them.<br />I loved the cute, kid-friendly packaging on these, the all natural ingredients, and the flavor options.<br /><br />When we opened our first pack, though, the smell was overwhelming - a briny, dead fish smell.  Taste was even worse.<br />This was not just a little "essence of the sea" smell and taste - it was overwhelmingly fishy!<br />One family member described it as being like "licking the inside of a really slimy fish tank", and I have to agree!<br /><br />I know several friends who love the product and have never had a "fishy" experience, so I have to wonder if they have some quality control issues.<br />Even if we were brave enough to give this product a second chance, I think I would certainly hesitate to buy in bulk again because of the amount of wasted money and food if we ended up with another bad batch.

The nuts are all big and always fresh.  They are flavored the just right amount, roasted with no added oil, and sea salted.  A good source of Vitamin B6, copper and manganese, these nuts are worth buying.  The serving size is generous but also accurate considering how they're hard to put down.  160 calories per serving and a serving is 49 nuts.  This 16-oz. bag has about 8 servings in it.  Recommended.

review/summary: Wow. I forgot what tea is supposed to taste like
review/text: Having switched to decaf a very long time ago, I apparently had forgotten what real tea tastes--and looks--like. This brews up a rich reddish brown, and has a flavor I only dimly recall ever experiencing. There is even a hint of the tannic dryness regular black tea has.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said this is "stronger" than other teas. If you're accustomed to Lipton/Tetley decaf, this will definitely take some getting used to. They are unbelievably weak by comparison. But I would say the PG Tips is not stronger per se, it's richer and more flavorful. Different.<br /><br />I like it strong, so I kept to my normal routine (2 bags per 10-12 oz.). I leave them in and just dump them out at the end--it does not get significantly stronger for it. (Lack of strings is a plus for me.)

review/text: Once I found PG Tips, there was no going back.  Compared to North American teas that I grew up with, it is a completely different product.  Being southern, I know of tea as cold, mild, and super sweet.  PG Tips has a ton of rich flavor, seeming more like a substitute for coffee than a summer drink.  It also has quite a bit of bite, which I like.<br /><br />Recently, I decided to cut back on caffeine, and my twice-daily PG Tips was the main target.  More than caffeine, I drink it for the flavor, so it's not such a big deal.  Unfortunately, the decaf version does lack some of that bite.  It instead has a gentler flavor.  It is still PG Tips to be sure and has a nice flavor, but it is not quite as good or satisfying.<br /><br />Overall, I feel much better drinking this than something with caffeine, with no crashing afterwards.  I have a nice even energy for most of the day.  This version is not as good as the original, but it is still a nice experience that beats the caffeinated versions of many teas.

review/text: I would just perish without PG Tips decaf! I'm off of caffeine, (grumble) and find that no other decaf tea seems to have the flavor of caffeinated tea. Thankfully, this product DOES. It tastes like regular tea- even better, actually! Quite smooth, rich and full bodied. They must never cease to make it! Puts all other decaf black teas to shame. Very pleased to find it on line, as no one near me carries the decaf any longer. Since I can no longer have my beloved PG Tips regular, this is the perfect substitute! Now if I could only wake up....oh, caffeine, right...oh well...at least I've got a cuppa.

review/text: Look no further for an excellent basic black tea.<br />- Look at the Tea section in any supermarket in the US and you'll find hundreds of available options. Most of these have nice packaging and some nice stories on the label. Most seem to be focused on the marketing - Certainly NOT on the Tea! In many cases the tea is marginal at best.<br /><br />PG tips is a great tasting black tea. I started drinking it while living in the UK. I've tried many teas and since finding PG Tips available in the US, I certainly do not bother with any other teas - at all. My supermarket fortunately carries the standard (caffenated) version, but I wanted to get the decaf version for my wife during pregnancy. The decaf version is also excellent. It is full flavored and it is really VERY hard to tell the difference - if at all...

review/text: PG tips are the best flavor of tea. PG tips are a consistent product and for any tea lover. They come in regular, decaf and loose tea or bags. The tea is a strong English blend and is distinctly flavored. Each cup is a relaxing retreat. I take my first sip in the morning and truly appreciate the taste. This is the BEST tea.

review/summary: The best tea in the world (in my opinion)
review/text: In my opinion, PG tips make the best tea. ever.<br /><br />However, with all the tea-drinking at my house, I opted for the decaf version and it is every bit as good as the regular.<br /><br />I am a firm believer in the "pyramid" shaped tea bags enabling the tea to steep to a full flavor.<br /><br />I drink my tea rather strong with scant milk, but this does make an excellent iced tea, as well.

review/summary: Great tea
review/text: My mother loves this brand, so we keep it in stock at all times.  Buying the larger boxes is the best way to keep your per cup price down.  We simply store the unused bags in the freezer, and they always come out fresh.  She drinks sometimes two cups a day, so we run thru a lot of bags.  This is the cheapest way to buy this brand I have found on the web.

review/text: Cranberries taste good, but packaging has a plastic chemical smell.  It doesn't seem to affect the taste.  Not as fresh as other brands I've had.  I assume they've really just overdone it on the preservatives, though nothing is listed on the packages' ingredient list besides "cranberries, sugar" along with an expire date almost exactly 1 year in the future. Perhaps the smell is just the bag.  Mild tartness.  I may try again if I can't find another brand that is better, but I'm not blown away.

review/text: Great product in handy re-sealable package.  Nice to have at home to grab a handful for a small snack or to add grain and meat dishes, if you're creative in the kitchen. Terrific to carry on trips; add a package of nuts and a bottle of water and you're in good shape to avoid having to buy junky food when traveling by road or air.  Also, a good addition to the "emergency food" kit -- long shelf life.  My household prefers Sunmaid dried cranberries to Newman's Own (I buy organic when I can, but Newman's Own coats their cranberries lightly with oil, which we don't like).  Some sugar is added to all dried cranberries I've ever come across, including these.

review/text: I bought this in the 2 bag pack at Costco and was pleasantly surprised at how crispy and chocolately this cereal is. It's got just the right amount of sweetness and leaves you with a great bowl of chocolate milk at the end, which is always a plus for me. The sugar content per serving is the same as Honey Nut Cheerios and is only 100 calories per serving, making it a good choice for a midday snack for my kids.<br /><br />As for the Amazon price, how can you beat the subscription price? It comes out to $2.45 a box, which is like 60% off of grocery stores. My kids love it and I eat it for breakfast often myself as well.

I very seldom eat cereal for breakfast these days, but my wife does and Cheerios are one of her favorites. Lately, she's been bringing Chocolate Cheerios home and says that she prefers them to the original. I tried them and they are indeed good. My young son (three years old) loves them, seemingly better than the old Cheerios. Well, he can be hard to feed, so if he loves Chocolate Cheerios and they're deemed nutritious enough then that's part of what he's going to get.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I'm so happy Chocolate Cheerios exist!  What a fantastic cereal!  Alright so it's probably unhealthy to the max since, you know, it's chocolate and according to my dentist and my deteriorating teeth, chocolate is a very bad thing... HOWEVER!  Taste-wise, you can't beat the chocolatey goodness of Chocolate Cheerios.  I highly recommend it to everyone who brushes regularly (and I'm not being sarcastic either- had I actually brushed during my teenage years, my teeth would be fine now and eating this cereal would have been no problem whatsoever).  Still, NOTHING beats Honey Nut Cheerios, and nothing ever will.  This is just a nice alternative from the norm.

review/text: I picked these up on a whim, and man, am I glad I did.  These are fantastic!  Most of the time, when you have chocolate in cereal, the chocolate is either to weak, or to strong of a taste. I'm pleased to report that this isn't the case for the Chocolate Cheeriors. The chocolate blend is perfect.  It does turn the milk chocolate, so that's a bonus.  If you want your kids to eat breakfast, the I highly suggest you get this for them.

review/summary: Amazon's Subscribe & Save program makes this a sweet deal
review/text: My wife likes to start her day with a taste of chocolate, so when Amazon's Subscribe & Save program began offering Chocolate Cheerios at a competitive price we placed an order. The first shipment arrived with an added surprise - each box has a Spongebob Squarepants toy inside! Our sons (ages 8 and 7) happily prepare their mother's morning bowl of cereal, knowing each serving gets them one step closer to completing the 8-piece collection.<br /><br />Of course, my wife would eat Chocolate Cheerios with or without the toy. She eats the cereal with 2% milk and a cup of black coffee because, really, you don't need cream or sugar when you're eating a bowl of chocolate cereal.<br /><br />Getting to the basics: the cereal was tightly packaged with no damage; the expiration date extends at least 12 months out, so there's no mad dash to consume six boxes at once; and the price is competitive with the supermarkets we regularly patronize. The added convenience of the cereal arriving at our doorstep rather than hauling it home in shopping bags is a bonus.<br /><br />Personally, I don't touch the stuff. I'm more of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LV6LQS">Post Raisin Bran Cereal</a> kind of guy. And, yes, of course, we buy that through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program as well.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars

review/summary: I must admit it is delicious... Great for camping!
review/text: I hadn't had Spam since I was a kid - at least 25 years.  My mother had lived in Hawaii, where it is a very common food (even in restaurants) and used to feed it to us on occasion.  I remember liking it in the same way I enjoy fried ham and bacon.<br /><br />Still, as an adult, the idea of most canned meat just revolted me, not to mention the fact that within most of the US culture Spam is associated with poverty.  I recently got the idea to buy some when we were about to go camping in a remote location with no electricity or running water.  I didn't want to only eat peanut butter sandwiches and cup o' noodles - I wanted something heartier, and canned foods are the way to go!  While camping, I made a "spam hash" - spam cut into tiny pieces and cooked in olive oil along with some canned diced potatoes.  On a cold morning, along with some coffee, it really hit the spot.<br /><br />I now keep a few cans in my cupboard, and eat it at home at times.  I think the key for people who don't like Spam, or who are trying it for the first time, is to cut it into thin slices and fry it until crispy.  The texture of uncooked Spam is somewhat spongy and paste-like at the same time.  This can turn a lot of people off.  If you fry thick slices, the slices will still remain quite soft, even if the outside is crispy.  The uninitiated (as well as many of the initiated) would probably love Spam if it were cooked until crispy all the way through - hence the need for thin slices.  You end up with something hearty and delicious, like thick bacon.  With a fried egg, or some hashbrowns, it makes a delicious breakfast.<br /><br />I'm not advocating consumption of Spam on a regular basis.  Even the lite version is relatively high in fat and sodium. But, that's no different from bacon, another item to be enjoyed on occasion but not every day.<br /><br />If you genuinely don't like Spam, that's fine.  Not everyone likes every food.  But if you put it down because everyone thinks it's for "poor people," then I suggest that you stop caring so much what other people think, and eat it if you will enjoy it.  The number of people who will eat any number of other processed foods but will disparage Spam is high.
