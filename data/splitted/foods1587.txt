review/summary: Very convenient
review/text: Love the convenience of the drawer, since it makes for easy access to the K-cups and organizes all the kinds we have. Drawer is sturdy. We're using our Keurig more now because of the drawer.  The Keurig fits on top of the drawer under cabinet when not in use.  However, we have to pull the Keurig out from under the cabinet to put in/take out the K-cup.

Fits perfectly under my Cuisinart brewer, and the rubberized top keeps it from moving and muffles the sound a little, too! Price was excellent, too!

review/text: Ordered this to hold K cups.  Does the job.  Would have preferred it to be a little wider rather than deep. would not take up as much counter space.  But it does what its supposed to do, to hold up to 18 cups it is utilitarian and very sturdy. the machine sits on top and can push under counter up against the back splash and still open the top to pour the water in without having to move the whole thing from under the counter, which I like.

review/summary: Good service, good product, poor utility
review/text: The service from this Amazon supplier was fast and efficient. The product was packaged well. The drawer is well made, operates smoothly, and, in my opinion is good value for the price. HOWEVER, please be aware of two drawbacks: the footprint of the drawer is quite big (cut the dimensions out of newspaper and put on the counter under your coffeemaker to visualize the space you will lose), and, fatally for my needs, the drawer raises the coffeemaker high enough under my (standard) top cabinets that I cannot fully raise the handle to insert the coffee pod. This product will not work if placed under cabinets.

What bugs me though is that there's a half-inch gap of extra space in each column, but that's a relatively minor annoyance. It still holds the 36 cups but expect them to slide around a bit when you're pulling the drawer out, even when it's fully loaded.

Only problem for me was that they picture the container to fit under the coffee maker, it does but my cupboards are too low so I couldn't open up the coffee maker all the way to put in the coffee. I put it next to the coffee maker and am able to put things on top of it.

review/summary: Top quality - great size that will fit right under the coffee machine.
review/text: I purchased this as a gift for my mom for Christmas.  I have one myself and love it.  If your coffee brewer is on an open counter space (not under the upper cabinets) it works out great....creates a "coffee station" where everything is right there!  My coffee brewer happens to be under the upper cabinets so I set the drawer beside it, and have "knick-knacks" sitting on it - quite cute!  The drawer is made very well - quality craftsmanship and solid, not to mention it looks great.  The drawer is large enough you can hold a variety of pods to keep the whole family happy.  I would definately recommend this product.

review/text: High-quality and convenient, this drawer is even nicer than I expected.  Sturdy, no wobbling.  Drawer holds 36 pods neatly, slides easily without a rattle. Non-slip top doesn't let Keurig move while using. Much better solution for me than having an additional bin for K-cups on the counter.  I'll be picking up a few more of these drawers for my family members with Keurigs, they'll love it too.  It's not mentioned, but since the dividers are the length of the drawer only, it would also hold silverware for a dinner party.  Non-slip top would easily hold a stack of plates.

review/summary: wonderful set up
review/text: The Coffee Storage Drawer Holder for the 36 Keurig K-Cup Pods is wonderful.  I purchased 2 and am extremely impressed.  I have place one flavor in each of the rows.  Because I know that they are all the same flavor in that row, I flip every other cup upside down and then you can fit 7 cups in each row.  So I make my 36 k-cup holder a 42 cup holder.  They are made out of very strong metal.  I have my Cuisinart Keurig sitting on one and my Cuisinart espresso machine sitting on the other one.  It makes my coffee counter look so nice, clean, and organized.  I occasionally spill water on the top when I am pouring water into the Keurig.  The top material of the storage drawers is FABULOUS!  It is a waterproof type material.  The water just beads and sits there until you wipe it off, but because of the raised edge, the water doesn't spill onto the counter.  I just ordered another one for my office and one for a Christmas gift.  I recommend this product and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007R900WA">Coffee Storage Drawer Holder 36 Keurig K-cup Pods by DecoBros�</a>

review/text: Got this in the other day and it was really nice. It is a very sturdy and has a nice foam padding on top to sit your Keurig on. I love the way the k-cup are displayed so you can see all the varities .  I got rid of a lot of k-cup boxes I had in the cabinet. I even found a few cup i thought i was out of. The only problem for me is that i put my Keurig on top of the drawer, and I cannot open the lid on the Keurig all the way to put the k-cup in the holder. so I have to pull the whole thing from under the cabinet to open it fully. So if you plan on putting it under the cabinet it's something to consider. I will probaly try and find a new place in the kitchen to put it. Also you can't beat the price. And this holder is hard to find in store. I've only found it in one store and the price was outrageous. I've only seen the smaller carosel holder for way more money. Over all good produce!

Make sure you have enough clearance above the now stacked brewer to refill the water since the storage drawer takes a couple of inches of vertical space. Having the extra counter space is a real plus with all K-cups tucked away in the drawer.

review/text: I bought 2 lbs of this product from this company and will NEVER buy again from them.  Their advertising "Organic" is false advertising as it is NOT organic and comes from China, the same country that had 300,000 babies die from toxic chemicals in baby food and is not regulated.  I don't do business with companies that sell dishonestly and mislead their products.  Make a phone call and find out the SOURCE and DOCUMENT when and if organic.

Here in Florida, I can go to Winn Dixie and get two one pound boxes for $5.00.<br /><br />So it is 2 pounds for $11.39 or two pounds for $5.00. Do the math. :)

review/text: I purchased a couple of bottles for my co-workers and myself to try, and I am regretting it. Now I wasn't expecting much from this in the first place since it's a novelty drink, and I knew it wasn't going to taste exactly like a strip of bacon. However the smell of the drink was awful, it tasted like flat Diet Pepsi, and the aftertaste killed any joy I had in tasting this concoction.<br /><br />I would only recommend purchasing this drink to use as a collector item/display, or to play a prank on someone by switching out their drink.

It really felt like I was drinking carbonated bacon grease.<br /><br />I'm not sure the idea of bacon soda is totally junk; this may have just been very poorly executed.  It needs to have a more subtle flavor.  I couldn't even finish half a bottle, it was that disgusting.

review/summary: It's the anti-bacon experience
review/text: I found a bottle of this at a candy and novelty shop at the coast. I brought it home and shared it with my family. All four of us LOVE bacon. It's one of the best-tasting things in the known universe. This drink has absolutely NOTHING in common with that taste. It's sorta sweet, and the actual bacon flavor is so minimal that it might simply be a placebo effect -- the power of suggestion or something. You sure won't find any indication of bacon in the ingredients list. And the taste itself? Freaking nasty. I'm serious. I wanted to like it. My son and I tried repeated sips, just to try to adjust to it and say we liked it. Truth is, we could barely swallow it. I poured out the last half of the bottle in the sink. None of us could stand it. Quite possibly the worst-tasting bottled drink ever. Really...EVER.

review/summary: A humorous yet creepy novelty soda...
review/text: After having initially sampled the LESTER'S FIXINS <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079KZ9AK">Sweet Corn Soda</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079KWXKY">Buffalo Wing Soda</a>, and now this "bacon flavored" concoction, I've come to the conclusion that this a rather creepy line of beverages.  However, I love the novelty idea of these weirdo sodas - for me, this helps to mitigate what would otherwise be a poor rating of these items.<br />All of this being said, I shared a bottle of this dubious beverage with three co-workers.  The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was a smell that is best described as an amalgamation of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EFBM4O">Baco's</a> imitation bacon bits and garbage!  In all seriousness, it was a somewhat fetid smell that, had I not known what this drink was, I probably wouldn't have tasted it.  Fortunately, the smell of this beverage was the worst part; if you can actually avoid the scent of this soda, it's marginally palatable.  In essence, it tasted like imitation bacon bits and cane sugar, with a faint, lingering aftertaste of liquid smoke.  It wasn't good, but out of the three "Lester's Fixins" sodas that I've sampled so far, this one was the least problematic to drink... But then again, that's not saying very much!<br />Lester's Fixins Bacon Soda is great as a novelty or as a gag gift, but that's about it.

review/summary: Great product, poor packing
review/text: As a kid I grew up enjoying Lyle's Golden Syrup.  Our family had it as a special treat and to help medicine go down!  It has been difficult to find here in America, especially at a reasonable price, so I was very happy to find it at Amazon.  I have ordered it twice now and will continue to order it in the future.  I like the bottles it comes in, they are so much easier to use than the traditional tin cans.  The only problem I have had is with our second order.  The bottles were not packed very securely in the box and a couple of them burst open during shipping.  When we opened the box there was syrup all over the interior, a gooey mess.  When we informed Amazon of the problem they immediately sent a replacement order which arrived in a timely fashion.  I was very pleased with their response although a little worried since the packing of the second box didn't look much more secure than the first.  It did make if safely though.

review/text: I first discovered "golden syrup" in the beautiful green & gold tins. While not nearly as lovely on the shelf, the transparent plastic bottles are MUCH superior in measuring, pouring and storage. I found the tin imparted a nasty metallic taste to the syrup, if stored after opening.  So, I started substituting dark corn syrup whenever possible :(<br />Squeezing the syrup into a measuring spoon or cup is easier, tidier and more accurate than pouring or dipping.  No bitter off-taste and better unit price?  GREAT! I'm stocking up!

review/text: I recently started using golden syrup as a vegan replacement for honey in certain of my recipes. I have found that when baking my No-Knead Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Honey White Bread that I can substitute Lyle's Golden Syrup for honey at a 1:1 ratio, with no change in the quality of the finished loaf. My latest project in a housemade lacto-fermented tomato ketchup, in which I use Lyle's Golden Syrup as the sweetener. It provides a depth of flavor which would not be attained with table sugar alone, and puts my mind to rest, as I need not worry about the antibacterial properties of honey preventing proper fermentation. I also plan on trying this with a mixture of Golden Syrup and Black Treacle.

I had been looking for golden syrup specifically to make a recipe called British Flapjacks, but it was not to be found anywhere near where I live, not even at Whole Foods.  I made the recipe using brown rice syrup and was pretty pleased, but I really wanted to make it "authentic" as the golden syrup is supposed to make all the difference.  So I decided to check at Amazon, and here it is.  I should have known.  I must say that the packing was not the best, 6 bottles just rolling around inside a box, but all were intact and no leaking, so I lucked out there.  So I'm off to make my British Flapjacks with my golden syrup. Yum yum.

review/text: Nothing else will do in my fabulous cakes.  No substitute comes even close.  Great packing, but slightly slow shipping.  Enjoy, but order quite early for special occasions.  Better yet, just keep a constant supply in your pantry and you'll never fret at the last minute!

review/summary: Outstanding product to keep on hand
review/text: I like to keep this on hand, especially when youngsters are coming for a visit. Great price & super for baking specialty dishes, adding a small amount to oatmeal or almost anywhere a little bit of sweetness is needed. Add in super saver shipping & it's a real bargain, worth it for the extra love added to treats. Beats refined sugar hands down.

review/text: Though I had heard of Lyle's Golden Syrup, I had never tried it before. I've now had it on waffles(delicious) and poured over and mixed with plain yogurt (also delicious).  Goldem Syrup has a flavor unlike any other.  I've not tried using it in any recipe.  Once I can convert the metric directions to our mearurements, I will try cooking with it.  All in all, this is an interesting and flavorful experience.

review/summary: Very Frustrating!
review/text: I purchased the Lyle's Golden Syrup because my grocery store quit selling it and this seemed a great alternative. The package of 6 bottles arrived this morning and upon opening the poorly packed box I found a bottle had been broken in transit. Had there been proper packaging I'm certain I wouldn't be frustrated. Hopefully, this will be rectified or I will cancel my subscription to this item. I pay for 6 bottles I expect to receive 6 undamaged bottles.<br /><br />Ordinarily I would give this product 5 stars since I have used it for decades in place of that nasty corn syrup.

review/summary: cleansing the blood
review/text: I was told by my NATURE PATH that this tea is BEST for me since I have a YEAST problem.  This tea is a BLOOD CLEANSER so I believe it would be good for all and if I have my information correct the PAU D'ARCO is the only tree in the RAIN FOREST that does not get FUNGUS hence good for CANDIDA YEAST.  You might want to check this information.  This tea is soothing and has a very different flavor, and I find it relaxing I do so enjoy the taste I also believe that knowing it is good for my BLOOD is another reason why I enjoy this tea so much.  The price was excellent and the product arrived on time and packaged well I would recommend this product HIGHLY

review/summary: Great tea, can't find in health food stores!
review/text: I purchased this because of it's antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial properties. I didn't buy it to treat a yeast infection but since I've been drinking about 2 cups of this per day I haven't had one - so that may help you consider this if you are buying it for that reason.  I have problems with viral infections and I believe this helps.  I believe it also boosts immune system as I drank this a few times when feeling I was coming down with a slight cold and woke up as good as new.  If you have a problem with yeast, I suggest you double team it, drink this tea as well as take probiotics.  If you buy this tea, do not expect results if you do not drink it regularly as well as prepare it as it was meant to be prepared - I usually steep 2 bags in about 16oz of water for 30 minutes COVERED, then drink and squeeze out the tea bags in the end.  The taste is not horrible, in fact I drink it without sweetener and it's soothing on my throat.

review/text: I got this because I read this tea is an antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial. That being said, imdrink 1 cup daily, and know it's one of the healthier things I put in my body. Is it effective for it's purposes? Possibly if you drink 4-8 cups daily for a 3 month time peiod (my guess).  But it probably aids in prevention of other diseases as well. Makes me gassy.

review/text: I like the Sixlets, not only do they taste great, but they are wonderful as gingerbread decorations.  I love buying the candy without the wrapper; there is nothing more time consuming than sitting around unwrapping this candy.  But Candy Direct is NOT the company to buy Sixlets.  I bought 5 lbs of the candy for $21.00, and paid $18.00, for shipping--regular 7 days later delivery!!!  Unacceptable!!!!  Never again Candy Direct.  It doesn't cost $18.00, to deliver this candy via the United States Postal Service.  For heaven's sake--$18.00!!!  $3.00 more and I could have had another 5 lbs of Sixlets!!!

review/text: Invisible Cherry Kool Aid is the best way I can keep myself hydrated throughout the summer months. I also love the taste and drink it on a daily basis. When they took the invisible brands of kool aid off the market I was totally blown away. Not only is Invisible Cherry Kool Aid great to drink, It's even better knowing that if it's spilled, It won't ruin what it's spilled on. I have already ruined several rugs. I have ruined several shirts from having the drinks spilled after one of my dogs jumps up to play as I'm drinking. Kool Aid has committed a great disservice when it took this brand off the general market. In addition to my loving the great taste of the Invisible Cherry Kool Aid, It can be easily drank at work or just about anyware, Given it looks like water. I now must buy this product over the internet. Once the supply is gone, I will need to find something else to quench my thrist. It's a great product which I will never understand, Was taken off the market. Thanks Kool Aid.

review/text: When we're looking for invisible, that means clear.  Like the clear Invisible Raspberry, and clear Invisible Grape and clear Invisible watermelon-kiwi.  This product description says it's a green powder and that it turns BLUE in water.  Blue is not clear nor invisible.  The product described is Blue Raspberry not Invisible Raspberry.  Kool-aid made an Invisible Raspberry whem they introduced the Invisible Watermelon-Kiwi, and that's what I want.

He was very happy to find these Dad's rootbeer barrels in his stocking on Christmas :)<br /><br />I enjoy these more than the A&W ones, there is more to the flavor than just sweetness.  Also, they are a long-lasting candy, you can suck on one for many minutes before it runs out.

review/text: @OrigamiMarie:  Thanks for your review.  Based on yours, I decided to try this version of Root Beer Barrel candy.  I agree with your input - they are, imo, better tasting than the A&W version.  Thanks to your info about A&W's version, I now know why I haven't been able to find them at local stores.  If anyone out there is a RBB connoisseur like me *laugh*,  then I highly recommend "Dad's" version RBB.  I also like this quantity option for purchasing.  I didn't want a large qty before trying these out.  My grade for this candy is A+.  Once again, I found the product I was seaching for at Amazon, as well as helpful feedback & information about this item.  As with almost every Amazon order I've placed over several years, my item arrived on time and without damage.
