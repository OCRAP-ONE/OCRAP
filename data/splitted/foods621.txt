review/summary: Too many tea leaves
review/text: The taste of the decaf tea was excellent, but the tea leaves came through the K-cup, causing the tea to pour very slowly from the Keurig machine.  I had to strain my cup of tea into another cup to remove all the tea leaves.

review/summary: Perfect cup every time!
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for a long time and am 100% satisfied with every cup.  The flavor is perfect... not to weak nor too strong.  It also makes delicious iced tea, too.  I usually drink caffeinated drinks, but like this because I can enjoy it any time of day or night and not have to worry about the caffeine keeping me awake. I have never had a problem with the grinds getting into the cup, as some other reviewers claim.  I also have never gotten any k cups with a bad seal.  I would highly recommend this product if you love a great tasting cup of tea that is ready instantly.

review/summary: Excellent tea, but inconsistent quality
review/text: This tea is by far the best K-Cup tea available, however some boxes have had problems. Some of the K-Cups are not airtight, and the foil lid is not sealed completely. This has happened in two of my past four orders in the past few months. About 30% of the K-Cups in each affected box have this problem. The unaffected K-Cups brew excellent cups of tea, and I would recommend this product once Twinings fixes the issue with the foil lid.

review/summary: Worst Tasting Hot Cocoa
review/text: We bought this assortment from Costco for $5.99 (they were clearing it out).  We were excited to try it, but quickly disappointed.  It is hard to describe the flavor, but it doesn't taste like the rich flavor I was expecting.  The toasted marshmallow was the biggest fail.  It just has dehydrated marshmallows added to the mix...nothing really special or "toasted" about it.  It seems like a lot of people like it with coffee, but if you just want delicious hot cocoa this would not be my choice.  My husband's comment was that even Carnation Brand tastes better than this hot cocoa!

They both just taste like any regular pack of plain hot cocoa mix you can get in the grocery store.  Only thing is these are more expensive and cost more to make since you must use milk.  Won't waste my money again.  I'll stick with melting chocolate chips into milk if I want a really rich/decadent hot chocolate.

review/summary: Better than the Other One... but not dark rich sauce I was looking for
review/text: I love Mu shu Pork.  When we order at Chinese restaurant, they call the rich dark sauce included with it "plum sauce".  But when I ordered two "plum" sauces, neither were anything like the wonderful "plum" sauce I love.  One of those was simply awful (like sugary syrup with almost no plum flavor)... THIS ONE was much stronger and more flavorful, but not the flavor I was looking for for this dish (will try as marinade to test).<br /><br />So apparently the chinese restaurants I order from incorrectly call the sauce "plum" instead of "hoisin".  Either way, the "Koon Chun HOISIN Sauce" is the very rich, dark "plum" SAUCE that is ADDICTIVE and DELICIOUS that I was looking for!  Can be used for other dishes (like Chicken), I'm sure, but especially delicious on Mu shu pork type recipe.  LOVE IT!

It's this exact product and they are my new favorite party food. Everyone raves about them and they require no prep at all. The only thing I recommend is drain as much of the oil off as you can, as they can be greasy. They are only mildly spicy, and go well with all types of fare. Despite my best efforts to cook everything I serve, no matter what else I make, these always take top compliments.

The "high sugar" rewivw is misleading, there is a good bit of sugar from the rice syurp but it didn't cause me any I'll effects. A hypoglycemic friend introduced me to these after her Dr reccomended them over what she was eating. It apparently is a better sugar than what we typically get. Of course, I didn't eat 3 (660-720 calories-who isn't worried about diabetes? That is almost two meals worth for one snack)

review/summary: My Yeast of Choice ofr Mead
review/text: Lalvin 71B-1122 is my yeast of choice for mead.  It is delivering consistent, tasty results.  I prefer my meads to be sweet and this yeast has never failed me.  Other yeasts can give dryer results that are less desireable for meads (in my opinion).<br /><br />One note of caution - it does take a significant amount of time to finish.  (I do not use yeast nutrients or energizers as I am brewing for a specific audience and prefer not to have modern ingredients in my mead.)  That being said, I will continue to use it and be patient.  Good mead is worth the wait!

The only drawback is the small portion size and price, otherwise the product is exceptional.  The salmon is not overly dried out and still contains a small amount of moisture to allow for a pleasant eating experience.  I order these bags on the monthly refill program to offset the cost to a degree, but I feel the product is worth the money.  Try it!

I like a variety of flavors, pepper, original, teriyaki, etc, but this salmon one was a little too salty.  The size of the salmon jerky was good, small enough to eat with one bite, and the flavor of the salmon was maintained with the smokey flavor.  Everything was just overpowered though with the heavy hand of salt.

review/summary: A gourmet snack
review/text: Back when salmon were plentiful, Alaska natives used dried salmon to feed their sled dogs during the winter.  Now salmon jerky has become a gourmet food snack.  Not everyone likes smoked salmon or salmon jerky, but I grew up eating smoked salmon and have always liked the flavor.  SeaBear has a good line of products, and has always been a good source for salmon products.  Salmon is a good source of Omega 3 and is heart healthy.  The jerky may seem a little high on salt, but some salt is needed in your diet to prevent problems like muscle cramps.<br /><br />The 1.25 ounce bags are listed as having 14 grams of protein with only 70 calories.  It is something that you can put in a day pack, or just keep around for a quick snack.

I wish it was just a little less salty though.  I gave a couple packages to my dad and he said he burned through it immediately and loved it.  I work as a bartender so I have 7-9 hour shifts without having time to stop and eat.  These packets were perfect for my dinner.  I could pop a piece in my mouth inconspicuously and be satisfied.  The only problem being my breath!  I was worried I smelled like I ate cat food while talking to my customers.  Oh well. I gotta eat too!  I will order this again even though it is expensive.  It's good for me and it's a luxurious treat!

review/text: I expect salt in a salmon jerky, but this is fully twice the salt level as a similar item I also purchased. Worse, it permiated the flavor. It was like salmon jerky texture with salmon-salt flavor.  The package is 1.25 oz and in what seems stilly, claim 1.25 servings. Gee thanks. So of course we will eat the whole thing and the 38% of salt for a day is really about 46%.  I might as well eat Campbell soup if I wanted salt poisoning at that level - it'd be a lot cheaper.<br /><br />I did find one bone. I would not count that as a problem.  I did not like that the pieces were chopped into fairly small chips.

review/summary: Salty, Delicious and Healthy Salmon Jerky
review/text: I've been a fan of beef jerky for years, but due to my recent pescetarian lifestyle change I no longer consume it. The cravings for jerky still haunt me so I was thrilled to see a salmon alternative. My first taste impression of this jerky was "Wow this is salty!". The salty taste may be a bit overbearing for some, but after a few chews I became quickly accustomed. It is much leaner than beef jerky and a bit tougher. At 70 calories per serving, this jerky makes for a tasty omega 3 rich snack. Some may think it's a bit pricey but you are paying roughly 4.50 for each bag; which is the average cost for any jerky that I've encountered. Quality always triumphs over quantity. I would recommend this jerky to anyone who enjoys the delicious taste and health benefits of fish.

review/summary: Not too salty! Fresh...
review/text: I am told this is NOT as salty as standard beef jerky! (not just the opinion, check out the nutritional information and compare to beef jerky) "Moist and chewy" as stated on the package. I might have been seeking something more dry and flaky?<br /><br />FISH AND EGGS are GOOD for digestion!<br /><br />However, what is potassium Lactate? Is this cow milk derivative? or is it bacteria from animal intestines?  some cheese is processed this way). We are way too curious. I'm usually vegan, actually, 17 yrs, don't tell anybody,...  but on Doctor's recommendation I thought we would try fish. Specifically, this dry smoked style fish, as it has a different texture than other meats? My child is lactose intolerant.  I would love to know how this agent is derived, just for humanitarian purposes too. I try to avoid cows and animal products fiercely. I'm so sorry. I worry FAR too much.... cows are better for less growth hormone lb per lb than chicken. Check it out. Fish would be way better with Zero growth hormones. : )<br /><br />Other than that, It seems like a fine product!<br /><br />PS. There is nothing wrong with being vegan, my health issues are due to extreme anxiety off my  medications... which lead to, ah, impacted bowels, and humans actually NEED probiotics and BACTERIA  in  gut. OH, and the SSRI meds can influence the bowels in ways that are not beneficial. anyway. So, maybe I should obtain different medications. B12 is an important vitamin. This is in MEAT (FISH, I assume, is meat) and in certain vitamin supplements slow release or under the tongue. I had tested for protein and vitamin deficiencies, (body  was not absorbing.. ah, nevermind. too much info, sorry). The doctor says the Omega 3 fatty acids (and or omega 6's) are very very very important for brain health! Doctor suggested oil supplements. but I thought fish is more natural? I'm kind of a hippie freak. Keep eating the fish!? or stop due to the so called heavy leads and mercury in the ocean? I don't know. I am not a doctor. I recommend that you do your own research and ask your  own doctor. Oh, and let me know the advice, please.<br /><br />OK , So, I was actually on a zero salt diet before. Turns out I need some salt to balance digestion of the sugar in my coffee. I also need iodine salt instead of sea salt. Iodine is important for thyroid health.<br /><br />FISH and EGGS are good for digestion!<br /><br />I'm freaking out. I'm not very good at eating meat, even fish!!!! Gosh, my world is so... off kilter from the rest of consumer society. wow... skewed.  It's really very difficult for me to eat fish. I know there is not fiber in it. so, I think this is only going to enhance any constipation issues, Maybe I'll try fish oil or better yet flax seed oil. Yeah. I am so crazy.<br /><br />THE FISH IS GOOD FOR #2 HEALTH! WORKS FOR ME! YEAH!

review/summary: Great Light Caesar Dressing!
review/text: I am very surprised there are no reviews for this product yet-I love a number of Newman's Own salad dressings, but this one sticks out. Many light versions of salad dressing lack flavor and are either loaded with sugar or sodium to make up for the other missing ingredients. That is not the case with the light version of Newman's Own Light Caesar dressing.<br /><br />While there is a marked taste difference between the Creamy Caesar and the Light Caesar-the light caesar still has a robust flavor without being too salty. In my opinion, the Light Caesar has bit more of a fish flavor and a little more of peppery-garlic bite than the Creamy Caesar. I really enjoy the Light Caesar and suggest everyone give it try if you are looking for a lower cal salad dressing!

review/text: I can't comment on the coffee itself because I haven't tried it. I'm not happy that the three packages of this ground coffee arrived in a large zip close bag with each of the packages inadequately closed so that grounds were in the zip. Air obviously gets to the coffee, which reduces the flavor quickly. I've purchased many ground coffees from Amazon and this is the first that had no seal. The roll down tab wasn't even closed tightly enough to hold the ground coffee in!<br /><br />Amazon, however, took my first complaint and had another shipment sent within a day. It arrived the same as the first, except this time, the seal on the plastic zipper bag (an Amazon sticker) was also broken. In this day and age, I'm not sure I would consider it a safe bet to drink the coffee, but it'll be stale anyway in no time at all.<br /><br />Waste of money. I won't order from this company again since it doesn't seem to care enough about it's product to even close the package properly.

I was a little disappointed when receiving them, as I am using them in an all blue themed party. Not a huge deal - just pay better attention to the photos. Other listings had specified if the bags were stitched with a colored hem. This one did not so I thought maybe it was completely neutral. The item description on the actual packing slip that arrived is '3"x5", drawstring with thin red hem'. I just wish I had seen that written out somewhere before seeing it on the actual packing slip. Otherwise the bags are nice.

review/text: This item is very poor. It came very damaged with multiple packs missing from the "48-packs" promised. It came with no packaging whatsoever, just the box seen in the picture with an address slapped on the side. The entire box was covered in tape as if it had been opened before and it seems a little more than coincidental that packs happened to be missing.

review/summary: How many dogs must die before these treats are removed from the market
review/text: My dog and others love this treat. The problem is that hundreds and thousands of dogs have died in the US after consuming these treats. One death was that of a good friend as it killed her beautiful German Shepard.  Her death was completely avoidable because the problem with these treats was known but not publically shared. Purina claims these treats are safe and yet hundreds of dogs have died after eating them.  These treats are made in China where the problem first occured with dog and cat food years ago. Back then the problems resulted in the same initial denial.  Please read related articles on this subject and make an informed decision about purchasing these treats.

review/text: Caf&eacute; con Leche, Coffee with Milk, a Hispanic favorite consisting of dry whole milk, sugar, and instant coffee is tasty and easy to make. Just add 8 ounces of hot water, 3 scoops Cafe con Leche to your favorite mug and stir. You can add more sugar, if desired.<br /><br />Finding this at local stores is hit or miss, so I usually stock up. It runs about FOUR - FIVE bucks per can. When I found it on Amazon it was cheaper!  I'm so spoiled to have this yummy delight delivered to my front door so I can enjoy a cafe-like beverage at home on the cheap. It's my FAVORITE international type coffee.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Cafe con Leche ( Coffee with Milk) is SO GOOD! It contains everything you need for those of you who like your coffee light with sugar. It contains dry ( powdered) whole milk, coffee and sugar...just add water. I ordered four, due to the price, but they arrived with only four months left of shelf life. I called Nescafe and was informed that this product starts out with a nine month shelf life. I will inquire about the expiration date prior to ordering next time. There are 13 servings per container if you use the three scoops per serving as suggested. I have it with my homemade almond milk. SO GOOD!!!! Great with toast. Nutritional facts: Total Fat 4g, Chol 15mg, Sodium 55mg, Total carb/ Sugar 13g, Protein 4g. Wish it were cholesterol free, so I have it sparingly... as a treat! Go to South Beach without the expensive plane ride!

review/text: VERY recently Nestle changed the formula for this previously wonderful drink into something awful.  The new drink has hydrogenated coconut oil. maltodextrine as the 2nd & 3rd ingredients, whereas the original drink had milk, sugar, and coffee listed as the top 3.  The packaging has also slightly changed, and the price is higher.  &lt;&lt;SIGH>> another good product destroyed by tampering with a winner.  I won't be buying this anymore.  Write to the company and tell them you dislike this new stuff!

review/summary: Tart, Crispy, Healthy Snack!
review/text: *****<br />These apple chips are tart, very crispy, and yummy! They don't have the processed or chemically taste that some dried apples have. They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. There are 6 servings in every 2.6 ounce bag, with 29 calories in each serving. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />These particular chips are only just barely sweet, mostly tart. If you want sweet apple chips, you can buy Fuji apple chips from the same company that are just as crisp and good. I like to mix both together for a sweet-tart combo.<br /><br />I would recommend (and it's way more economical) to buy these in bulk. If you like tart apples at all, and you like your chips crispy, then you have nothing to lose.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: My new standby
review/text: While the negative review below is certainly a valid negative shopping experience, this "chipotle ketchup" is delicious. Not really ketchup and not quite barbecue, this tastes wonderful as a spicy swap-in for either of those condiments.<br /><br />The heat is nowhere near enough to register with chile-heads, but is quite noticeable (and as such people who dislike spicy foods should pass). More prominent is the smoky chipotle flavor, which is reason enough to have meat three meals a day. I rarely use ketchup or BBQ anymore but that I'm tempted to use this instead.

review/summary: A box of ketchup
review/text: After a visit to an amazing gourmet hot-dog restaurant in Cleveland left me with an unquenchable love of chipotle ketchup, I decided to see what Amazon had to offer. I found this excellent write-up for a product that seemed to fit the bill.<br /><br />So I placed an order, and the next day, I received a box of ketchup.<br /><br />I mean that literally: I received A BOX OF KETCHUP - as in, an Amazon cardboard box soaked in ketchup, with a broken glass bottle and two little air packets swimming feebly inside.<br /><br />Perhaps this was the manufacturer's entry in Amazon's Frustration-Free Packaging initiative - cutting out the unnecessary packaging-material middleman between the Amazon cardboard box and the actual product. I humbly observe that this attempt, while innovative, has some implementation flaws.

review/summary: Favorite Refried Beans
review/text: My family has been using these for close to ten years.  We love them.  They're just plain pinto beans w/o a bunch of additives. The flavor of the beans themselves is good - sometimes amazing (quality varies, but they've never been bad, just sometimes they're epic...).<br /><br />We heat them with added water, Celtic sea salt, and a little organic sunflower oil mixed in.<br /><br />Recently when our store was out of these we tried a few other brands (Rosarita Vegetarian, Amy's Organic, and Eden) and YUCK.  I thought all the others we tried were exceptionally gross.  The added ingredients in the other brands disagreed with us.  These may be plain beans, but that's a major part of what's great about them - I choose how to flavor them.<br /><br />The only way these could be improved is if Bearitoes switches to BPA free cans.

review/text: My son loves strawberry Nesquik and we always seem to be running out of it.  I was thrilled when I found out I could buy it in bulk from Amazon.  The problem?  We live in the Midwest and this is not the same formula that I buy here at the grocery store.  The color of this Nesquik bought from Amazon is a bright neon pink and smells different from the strawberry Nesquik that I buy from a local store.  I didn't mention the difference to my 3 1/2 year old when I gave him some milk made with this strawberry Nesquik (made in Mexico?) and he immediately gave me the drink back and said he didn't like it and that it tasted bad.  Buyer beware!  This cannot be returned because it's a grocery item...nothing like throwing 15 bucks directly into the garbage!

Unfortunately, they used excessive amounts of artificial sweetener and this stuff is actually more sweet than regular hot chocolate - but in that syrupy, medicine type of way.<br /><br />Now I live on Splenda and thus I have no aversion to artificial sweeteners in general but this one is over the top.  That said, it you blend one of these with a bold coffee then you actually get a fairly good mocha - just do not add any sugar/sweetener ahead of time!
