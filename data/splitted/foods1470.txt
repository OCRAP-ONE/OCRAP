review/text: Great extra bold cup of coffee! I make it on the largest setting into my travel mug with a bit of sugar and hazelnut creamer and it is wonderful! My husband prefers to stick to the Donut Shop coffee, he says this one is too strong, but if you like bold coffee you will love this one!I will for sure be drinking this throughout the winter, then I will switch back to Donut Shop when the weather turns warm again. Dark Magic is even better than Santa's Buzz.

review/summary: A very nice blend, more robust than others
review/text: As with all coffees, you need to taste and see what appeals to you, but this coffee has a good reputation, which it has earned justifiably.  The espresso beans add a special flavor that is extremely appealing.  This is not my everyday coffee, I save this for Saturday/Sunday mornings when I have time to enjoy it.

review/summary: An excellent dark coffee if you like a little bite in the morning
review/text: I have purchased quite a few K-Cup blends for the Keuring, well over a dozen.  Some were for company and friends but this one was for me and I LIKE it!  I have to be honest and say that it not my favorite but it's up there among them.  Even when I have one coffee that I like above others I try to vary my K-Cups.  Sometimes it makes me appreciate my favorite better, other times I just want something different.  Green Mountain Dark Magic is always in my Keurig carousel.<br /><br />This blend is not as complex as Newman's Own Bold or Coffee People's Organic Bold Roast, however it doesn't hit you over the head like Timothy's Extra Bold Rain Forest Espresso.  I have not found a K-Cup that is as bold or full-bodied as coffee that I brew in traditional methods (a French press is my favorite) but this one comes close.  All-in-all an excellent K-Cup.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M2BM34">Newman's Own Organic Special Blend Extra Bold K-cup for Keurig Brewers, 12-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZAS">Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Extra Bold Espresso for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>

review/summary: My Favorite
review/text: As I have grown used to my Keurig over the last year, my tastes have changed to bolder and darker flavors. Dark Magic has become my very favorite, order by the case, morning-ain't-right-without-it blend.<br />Dark Magic is in the same league as Sumatra Reserve and Black Tiger, to name a couple of other favorites. However, I think it holds up best to the Keurig process and avoids the pitfalls of watery taste or bitterness that some other blends suffer from.<br />There are also some extra bold flavors that seem to go for sheer overpowering strength, at the expense of complexity and flavor. Dark Magic has it all.<br />Highly recommended to fans of very full strength and bold-tasting coffee.

review/text: I like this blend very well, its the next best thing to my favorite. Dark Magic isn't as strong as the name suggests but compared to Jet Fuel and wake up call this is the strongest.  If money is no object, consider plugging Kona Coffee into Google, then select a seller and order Peaberry Kona. At about $17.00 for 8 oz its the most expensive available.  But I absolutely frigging guarantee it'll be the best, richest and most satisfying cup of coffee you've ever had.

review/summary: Bold for Green Mountain, but not BOLD
review/text: If you are looking for a BOLD k-cup, try the Coffee People "black tiger" or their "french roast" bold... they are about the closest thing to a cup of Starbucks that you can get in a k-cup.  This is fine if you like Green Mountain, McDonalds, or Dunkin' Doughnuts coffee.  It has a classic GM slight nutty/sweet taste that I am not overly fond of but it is okay for an evening cup or when you are in the mood for something lighter.

review/summary: Magical
review/text: A slightly aggressive approach gives way to a fullness that is unmatched by the other so-called extra bold varieties. The finish is crisp, clean, and ultimately satisfying.  After several cups, one begins to contemplate that there might be an even darker, more fulfilling blend out there somewhere, perhaps being plucked from deep within a jungle or rain forest, or the side of a volcano.  Perchance there is, but until that is discovered, I must continue to let the magic wash across my taste buds, and deal with the sadness that follows the completion of a cup, knowing that the next cup has yet to be poured.<br /><br />Salut.

review/summary: Arrived as described
review/text: I ordered these K-Cups with points from my credit card.  They arrived as described, but without much packaging - - they were just sitting loose in the box, which works for me.<br /><br />The coffee is what I expected after trying a cup from a co-worker.  It's a fairly dark roast, but not as bold as the Newman's Own roast.  I like it for my breakfast coffee.<br /><br />I don't have anything negative to say, although I'm not sure the K-Cup route in general is the way to go for me because of the cost.  I purchased 50 cups just so the cost would be somewhat reasonable.<br /><br />I think you can get a good single cup in other ways, by using something like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B194FY">Cilio Porcelain No. 4 Coffee Filter Holder</a>.  I haven't tried this yet, although I saw one at World Market for $7.  You can heat up your water with a water kettle like this one: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EBV0IM">Bodum Bistro 17-Ounce Mini Cordless Electric Water Kettle, Black</a>.<br /><br />The convenience of the K-Cups is awesome, but I think I'd like the flexibility and cost savings of a different way.

review/text: The "experts" say that the k-cup method of making coffee is wonderful for its ease and quickness and makes a very nice brew for those that like favored and/or medium roast coffee, but is not capable of making a robust cup for those that like their brew powerful!! I would have to agree!! I have tried just about every dark roast, french roast, italian roast coffee sold by Amazon and the only one that comes close to robust, in my opinion, is Coffee People's "Wake-Up Call". "Dark Magic" has a sweetness to it, which is not to my taste. Overall, OK, but not a winner in robust flavor!!

Strong... but very acidic, bitter and this very unfavorable "flavor' sticks with you in the form of a lingering aftertaste!<br /><br />Those of you who thought that this was actually a "good coffee"... you really need to... well, find some good coffee to make a comparison!<br /><br />I mean... who samples and then actually approves this stuff for production????  It's Nasty !!!!

review/text: Green Mountain Coffee Roasters began life as a cafe in rural Vermont. They specialized in quality coffee, and continue that tradition through to today.<br /><br />Now, with a name like Dark Magic Extra Bold, you might expect an overpowering coffee - you know, the kind that will grow hair on your chest whether you want it or not? Well, in fact, this coffee is smooth and rich, and (if made right) not overpowering at all. I find this to be a delicious coffee, one that I enjoy any day of the week.<br /><br />(Review of Green Mountain Dark Magic Extra Bold K-cup)

review/summary: Hits the Spot in the Morning
review/text: My Doctor only allows me two cups of caffeinated coffee per day, and if that is all I'm going to get, then by George this is the brand and the roast I'm going to be drinking!<br /><br />Rich, full bodied and aromatic. A hint in the aroma of spices, deep dark color, a taste that will perk you up and get you ready for the day.  There is  no bitterness, and this Dark Magic makes an excellent iced coffee as well as a superb hot coffee.<br />I also drink this later on in the day, (I drink more cups than I would like to admit in public) decaffeinated and it shares the same attributes as the fully caffeinated one.<br /><br />As far as expense goes---well yes it is more expensive than a store brand, but it truly is worth it. Not everyone shares my addiction so it won't be as costly for you as it is for me, and I think it works out to be about 66 cents a cup (without additives of sugar, creamer etc.) a far cry from anything you can get from any coffee shop, or drive thru.

It's heaven.<br /><br />My husband likes coffee water (as someone in a review labeled it)and he goes for the Breakfast Blend on a larger cup setting.  But that is the wonderful thing about K-cups.

This selection is a little stronger but it tastes like a bit more roasting is all that separates the two. If you use this for a travel cup (8oz or more), it will not be as flavourful. I found that this flavour "grows" on you and a work colleague of mine absolutely loves this one.

review/summary: Not the same quality!
review/text: I compared the 18 cup Dark Magic (from Target) to the 50 cup Dark Magic(from Amazon), since the labeling and k-cup is markedly different.  The coffee did not taste as rich, so I became more curious.<br /><br />I opened the k-cups to find the 50 cup filters have a visible cross hatch pattern, as compared to a dense firm paper style.  I used a microscope to see the difference in density, as well.  The weave of the fibers of the 50 pack is not as closely bound.<br /><br />The coffee granules are finer in the 18 cup, giving the coffee a different texture on the fingers.  The 50 pack ground coffee appeared 50%-100% larger under the microscope.<br /><br />I hope that Keurig can shed some light on my findings!  I have photos I can submit.  I notice amazon is out of stock, currently.  Perhaps, Keurig is looking into the matter.

I have had a difficult time finding truly strong, yet flavorful coffee for my Keurig brewer--Timothy's coffees are too acidic and Van Houtte blends lacked complexity--and  I've finally found several extra bold flavors from Green Mountain roasts that really deliver that morning one-two punch.  For comparison, my other favorites are the Espresso blend (sadly now discontinued) and Double Black Diamond (a bit more of a smoky flavor).  And for the most potent flavor profile, the Barista Prima Italian Roast is magnifico!

I did a search for extra dark coffee and found these for significantly less.  This coffee is perfect.  Rich, dark, flavorful, not at all bitter.  Smooth and delicious.  If you like dark roasts (French, Italian, etc) and have a k-cup machine, this is the coffee for you.

review/text: I just recently got my first Keurig machine (I say first because I love it, and plan to get the bigger pro model eventually), and a couple of sampler boxes. This was the best of the flavors I sampled, and that says alot because I loved most of them. I am a lifelong espresso drinker (Cubans start giving their kids sips at like age 3) so I like a strong coffee. This one is definitely that. It doesn't, however, suffer from the bitter aftertaste or "burnt" flavor of many bold blends. Best of all, with the Keurig machines you get the same flavor EVERY time.

review/text: This coffee has made me forget Starbucks. It tastes a lot like the grande lattes I had been drinking. I'm using it in the Platinum Keurig and making the largest cup size (travel mug size.) Wonderful.

review/summary: Full flavor at largest cup setting
review/text: I tried this from the sampler pack and couldn't get over how great it tasted when brewed at the largest (travel mug) setting in the Platinum brewer. Although I like the Breakfast Blend from Green Mountain for my actual breakfast cup of coffee, this is the one that is keeping me out of Starbucks!

review/summary: Product has changed
review/text: I've bee subscribing to this coffee for months now and have had multiple shipments, all quality until this last shipment.  I opened the new box today, made a cup, and wondered why it was so watery. Made a second thinking it was a fluke. It was not.  Seems now 3 kcups into the box, the whole box is full of kcups with about half the coffee in them there should be.  Instead of it being strong and bold like dark magic is supposed to be (I've drank this coffee daily for two years now so I should know)... It's weak and watery even on making a smaller cup of it.  Amazon won't let me return it.  I'm a dedicated amazon customer and use subscribe and save for many items.  If they won't treat me like a dedicated customer I might be stopping my membership.  Hoping they'll make it right.

review/summary: favorite 50 cent KCup is still elusive
review/text: Am still searching for a 50 cent K-Cup with decent flavor. This particular Extra Bold K-Cup is ok but is not anything special. Looking for discounts is tedious and tiresome. Have pretty much decided that the 50 count or 100 count "value" packs offer the best price available. Others swear by CostCo so it does help to shop around but the 50 cent K-Cup is still elusive. Extra Bold K-Cups as a whole seem to have better flavor than the regular variety.

review/summary: AWESOME COFFEE!
review/text: We ran out of K-cups and I absolutely cannot begin my day without my coffee-jolt.  (WAY better than Red Bull, etc.)  Green Mountain Coffee is our preferred brand/flavor, so I decided to scan through Amazon.com to see if they carried it.  A 50-count box of Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic, (Extra Bold), was available at a crazy-low price, so I ordered it.  Not only did it arrive in perfect shape, before the promised delivery date, but there was 51 K-cups in the box!  A bonus!  Great coffee and great service at a great price!

review/text: I am one of those people who like for their coffee to "walk and stand alone". This one does. Great taste, no bitter after taste. Very dark roasted color, smell and taste. It does have backbone. I even put cream and sweetner in a cup to see if "watered" down. It didn't. Stayed true to taste and flavor. Oh yeal! I see a lot of this in my future.

review/summary: Awesome coffee
review/text: I bought the Keurig because when I wake up in the morning I'm a zombie that runs into walls and can't see past my nose, so I wanted a machine that would take any possibility of brain power needed out of making coffee for that oh so needed caffein punch in order to wake from my stupor. I have found though that the k-cups tend to produce watery and bland coffee at best, which is why it was such a nice surprise to find these dark magic extra bold k-cups! These things actually taste like decent coffee and aren't watery or acidic. Thanks green mountain for an awesome product and for curing my morning zombie woes! Oh and although a small gesture, I noticed that they shipped me 51 k-cups, thanks for the 1 extra!

review/summary: tastes horrible
review/text: I have been drinking dark magic for a long time, this in no way compares, its horrible, watery. I should have been suspicious when the coffee pods were floating free in the box rather than packed in the company box. I thought the first cup was an accident but today it tastes just as bad. Very disappointing and no return policy. Don't buy it its junk.

review/summary: Good as Dunkin's Coffee
review/text: I needed to change up from the coffee that I was drinking due to it being so much money. I tried a breakfast blend but it was so weak I gave the rest away. Decided to give this a try and so glad I did. The taste is right up there with my old favorite Dunkin Donuts coffee and the cost is much lower. I use fat-free half and half and splenda so it does make it alittle weaker, so thats perfect for my taste buds.
