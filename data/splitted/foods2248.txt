review/summary: Good price, great coffee!
review/text: Fantastic organic coffee, cheaper than I can get in the store locally. I like to drink organic coffee to reduce pesticide exposure, but the cost stops me from buying it. With subscribe and save, I end up paying the same amount for this organic as I do for conventional in the store! I wish I could tell you why this coffee tasters so delicious, but I don't know how. Try it!

review/text: I originally searched for TONE'S or WEBER Canadian steak seasoning.<br />I used these brands for years as a table seasoning in lieu of salt as I<br />am a heart patient and am limited in salt intake.  These filled the bill!<br />When these items could not be found or were discontinued, this product was<br />most similar in their advertising, however the taste of this product<br />is horrible by comparison to the above mentioned superior brands.

review/text: All of the Corazonas Oatmeal Squares are good, but this one is my favorite. It's not overly sweet like most regular brownies, and the oatmeal and nuts provide just the right texture. If you microwave it for 10-15 seconds (after you take it out of the wrapper) it's much improved, like it just came out of the oven.

All 3 provide a good tasting & filling snack no matter what part of the day you eat them.

review/text: These are moist, chewy, chocolately, and not too sweet, with little semi-sweet chunks of chocolate. Perfect when you are on the go, or if you are a chocoholic and need a chocolate fix! It's hard to believe they are actually good for you. They don't taste like cardboard the way many other healthy snacks do. I have low blood sugar so when I need to eat, I NEED to eat. I keep one in my purse if I get hungry or blood sugar is low, and it totally satisfies me for at a least a few hours without dipping my blood sugar later and making me tired the way a candy bar does. I can't recommend these enough! I got these when they were on sale at Costco. They are little cheaper there per box but you have to buy 6 boxes at a time.

The bar gives textural satisfaction in that it has crunch from the almonds and the chocolate makes it seem like a brownie.

review/summary: Like having a dessert bar for breakfast
review/text: I have tried Corazonas oatmeal squares in the brownie and almond, chocolate chip and cranberry versions. They are all wonderful, and taste especially good when microwaved for about 20 seconds. I have one each day for breakfast with a small bowl of fruit along with my coffee. I was in the habit of eating oatmeal each day to help reduce my LDL cholesterol but these oatmeal squares offer the same nutrients plus the plant sterols that are said to help lower LDL. It's a nice change from oatmeal. We shall see....I'm trying them for another month before having my blood work done again.<br /><br />I'm surprised at one or two reviews I read which stated that the squares were crunchy. In my experience they are all very chewy, like having a soft oatmeal or chocolate chip cookie. I don't have a favorite. They're all good. I keep all three on hand and just vary them.<br /><br />I have also tried Corazonas potato chips and tortilla chips and they are also very good tasting although I do try to stay away from eating snack foods in general. The oatmeal squares I can justify because of the importance of having something nutritious for breakfast.

I have some sort of food allergy so I keep a diary of everything new that I eat, so I know this is what did it to me AND the ingredient list on these are long and unnecessary plus they smell weird. I now have eleven paperweights that I am chucking in the trash ASAP. I wouldn't even GIVE these away to starving children in third world countries. They are evil, evil brownies. I read on another review the person had also gotten migraines and two of his/her family members as well! I am not imagining it, believe me!

If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.

review/summary: Did Nothing
review/text: I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.

review/summary: Tastes like sweaty gym socks
review/text: I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

review/summary: Best Mustard Hands Down!!!!
review/text: My family and I eat this mustard like it's going out of style! Don't be fooled by the name "Martha's Hot Mustard". To be honest, I think they could spend some money to hire some marketers and get rid of the cat label and the word "Hot" in the title. It's more of a tangy kind of mustard that works great with EVERYTHING. I put it on burgers, chicken, kebabs, etc. After using this I can't go back to the standard yellow mustard in stores. Trust me on this one...try it!

review/summary: Good for those who have a reason to avoid oil.
review/text: I just had to try these to see what the little sardines packed in nothing but water would be like.  And, I get a chance to find out what an oil-less sardine tastes like.<br /><br />Well, they taste like sardines without the oil, and if you are a sardine fan like me you might want to try this once to see what they're like.  They actually taste rather fresh, and the water is way easier than oil to get off your hands and the kitchen counter if you happen to spill some.<br /><br />Once I had the can open, I put them in a bowl and covered them in honey mustard and sea salt and warmed them up.  Then I ate them on crispbread (those big flat bread crackers).  Not a bad snack at all, but I'm going back to the ones packed in olive oil.

review/summary: If you like Sardines or are new to them, these are a good brand to try
review/text: If you are new to Sardines I would recommend this King Oscar brand over other ones at markets. In water or in oil, both are good.<br />This particular version of the King Oscar is in water and not oil. Also, it says no salt is added. So this version is even better for people who eat Sardines on a more frequent basis.<br /><br />As someone else mentioned you can buy these at your local Safeway or Vons if you are in the US. I found it to be around $3.50 but price varies I suppose...But generally once you taste King Oscar brand sardines you understand why the cost is a little higher than the other brands.<br /><br />These Sardines do not have the overwhelming fishy smell/taste that other Sardine brands have and the Sardines themselves are of better quality and texture.<br />With these you don't feel like you have to force yourself to eat them, you actually enjoy them. They are also a nice smaller size, they are around the  size of a finger and are packed nicely.<br />Also, these sardines are caught in the Norwegian area and packed in Poland. Hard to find packaged sardines from that region in US Markets. Most sardines I found sold at the US markets are from China, Canada, or Morocco.<br /><br />Overall, If you like Sardines these are a good brand.

review/summary: Decaf with some kick
review/text: This espresso roast didn't knock my socks off with super smoky deep-roasted flavor, but it's the richest I've found so far in the large-bag decaf category. At least it's from Seattle, though it's not what I drink when I go back home. The beans seemed very fresh, with a nice liquor aroma when I first opened the foil bag. A good sign! After making sure I liked it, I signed up for regular delivery at three month intervals. A good value! I am down to the end of my first bag. The five pounds blended with 40% regular French Roast beans from another company lasts two of us about three months. (I think we might be drinking too much coffee!) I see that Caffe D'arte also wood-roasts some blends and I'd love to see these offered here.

review/text: I found this Brand of food while at my local specialty pet food store (not petco etc!) .looking over the ingredients I was pleasantly surprised! @.90 cents a 3ozcan it was a great buy compared to the grain &gluten free food I was already purchasing  & my cats would eat it sometimes � others, so I wasted a lot of $ often.i took a chance on THIS &WOW, my 4 Siamese & 1 domestic house cat( lol) LOVED IT!!!! There are many favors, though most are FISH based, which all my cats love but I know some cats don't.there are a few all chicken favors as well though. After that I was in &out of that store 2-3x's a WEEK getting more of this food! Now I get it CHEAPER on AMAZON & delivered to my DOOR! Plus w/ subsc &save it's even cheaper still & I receive  it on a reg basis! No more wasted gas & trips to the pet store! Yay! I am a research nut & having lost my 10 yr old cat to a sudden diabetic coma due directly to her food, I now read EVERY lable &all ingredients.all cat/dog food is NOT created equal & could be really bad for your pet.if u do the research as I did, u will be discusted at what some companies actually put in our pets food!  This brand is a great choice @ a good price! My cats are very picky eaters, as are MOST cats, lol-but they ALL love this food! They now will  not eat anything else! Sometimes an occasional can of Merrick brand grain-free food, which is another Exellent product, just for variety. Hope this helps someone else choose a good food for thier cats... :)

The can is stuffed with tuna and not like the cans us adults have to buy with mostly water in them. There are nice size anchovy fish in them, one cat tried to steal another's fish. One can is enough to treat all three of my cats with a good sized spoonful. They lick the bowl clean.

review/summary: EXCELLENT--if you know what to expect.
review/text: This is really the only non-sulfured, organic, no-sugar-added pineapple I've been able to find. And, lucky for me, I love it. My husband and I eat it straight from the bag as a snack, and we also mix it into our trail mix. It has good flavor, and it's tender and easy to eat.<br /><br />However, this is nothing at all like the dried pineapple you can find in most grocery stores. The stuff in the grocery has sulfur to keep the color light and bright, and it has a bunch of sugar to keep the fruit plump and juicy (and oddly sticky). This stuff doesn't have any of that. It will be darker and tougher (and less sticky). This is very natural, as in full-on, granola-eating hippie kind of natural. And if you're OK with that...it's delicious.<br /><br />We've eaten our way through about 30 bags of this now. Some bags have better pieces than others. Some have good individual bites. Some have clumped up pineapple bits. But they all taste good, and we've never gotten anything that was the least bit questionable. We've tried many of the other Made in Nature dried fruits, as well, and we've been equally pleased with all of them.

review/summary: Moist, chewy, and delicious
review/text: Other reviews have described the contents of the pineapple packs but not as well as this...<br /><br />The pineapple chunks are mostly wedge-shaped and they stick together because of the sugar content. The color of the pieces range from faded yellow to beige to caramel brown. They are flatter than fresh pineapple chunks. But they are absolutely delicious. It's not the kind of food where you eat one chunk at a time as they are clumped together, so it's almost like putting a wad of it in your mouth and chewing on it. And it's awesome.<br /><br />If you are active outdoors these are an excellent source for quick energy and the packs I bought have an expiration date of over a year from now. I guarantee you'll be happy with this product.<br /><br />Warning: DO NOT buy the freeze-dried pineapple product you may see as an alternate item on Amazon. They are terrible!!!

review/summary: I Like Pedigree, I don't like Amazon
review/text: I have been feeding my dogs Pedigree Plus Healthy Digestion Premium ground Entr&eacute;e with chicken & brown rice.  I buy it at Walmart in 13.2oz cans for 97 cents a can.<br />It upsets my dogs stomachs to change dog foods so I keep a good supply.  For some reason Walmart was out of the Healthy Digestion for over a week, so I decided to turn to Amazon. (BAD MOVE).  They divided my order between two warehouses.  One (TheNewMall) sent me 16 cans and charged me $53.58 ($3.34875 per can includes shipping).  The other (Ozbo) sent me 12 cans and charged me $44.58 (3.715 per can includes shipping). I thought I was getting 48 cans for $98.16 (2.045 per can includes shipping).  I understand how Amazon became a wealthy company almost overnight.<br /><br />I will try to change my dogs to a food that is not so hard to get. Pedigree company employee I talked to on the phone could not care less if I was having trouble finding an outlet for their "Healthy Digestion", He told me to use the link "find a store near you". (None of them even carry "Healthy Digestion").  The only thing I could get out of the person I talked to with Pedigree is they would not sell directly to me and they were not discontinuing the product.

I didn't get this product for the poo results, but it definitely has some diuretic effect, because I shortly noticed I was urinating more often too, and within two days my facial bloat went down.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, it can make you cramp a little if you make it too strong or have too much, and you will be using the restroom more. But for short term bloating issues, it really worked for me.

review/text: I like the Super Slimming tea because if you are constipated, the herbs incorporated will most definitely get your digestive system moving very quickly.  I would definitely not go too crazy with the number of bags you use per drink and I wouldn't even drink it every day (unless you haven't had a bowel movement in a month!) as the Super Slimming tea can definitely bring on diarrhea if you're too aggressive with drinking it (i.e. I drink one cup at night...by the 3rd night, my bowel movements are REEEEAALLY soft).  It would be a great addition to any detox diet/efforts as it really speeds up elimination, but just be careful by maybe drinking for a couple days then laying off one or some other alternating schedule.

review/summary: Great for streaming down your waist!
review/text: This is an excellent tea!  I've used it for a couple of years, and in comparison to others, this is by far the best.  I suggest when you first start, you follow the directions thoroughly and make a weaker brew, by not steeping it as long as you regularly would.<br /><br />The taste is rather nice, when I first began, I added a bit of honey, but now I just drink it straight.  It's great at cleaning out your insides, especially if you've been eating unhealthy and are backed up.<br /><br />If this is too strong for you, I do recommend the Ultra Slimming, it comes in a green box.  It's just as effective, but slower results...perfect for those of you that aren't used to regular cleansings of this sort.<br /><br />I generally follow the tea routine for 5-7 days straight once or twice a month.  As a matter of fact, I'll be drinking some tonight!

review/summary: Does the job and the price is right
review/text: We have tried a few different "slimming" teas both from Triple Leaf and other makers as well.  Triple Leaf makes a blue box version which accomplishes the same result but the taste is not as good and tkaes about four times longer to steep.  I know that many people warn about steeping too long.  I have not found that to be an issue.  Unless you are new to "slimming" products, oversteeping should not be a problem, but you may want to try half a cup the first evening.  We add fresh honey and the taste is actually pretty good, though without the honey it is not the best.<br /><br />No doubt Amazon has the best prices on this and other Triple Leaf teas.  Locally, our grocery store stocks these at about $5.90 per box.  In the the case of six and with Prime you are getting it for half price.  If you want really save you can subscribe, but we switch between teas so often we don't subscribe to many.  Make no mistake though, this is intended to and it does do the trick.

review/summary: Great tea to take at night to flush your system the next day
review/text: I bought this for my mother who has bowl troubles. She likes it at night and it really is very easy on the system. Nothing harsh about it, just one cup will do. Senna works miracles for making you flush out your system. I would recommend this at night and in the morning take a glass of fiber for a week up to a month.. it is a great colon cleanser

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: This is great coffee.  I generally like weaker coffee but this can also be made quite strong without being bitter.  The grind is very fine, but it still works well in a drip coffee maker.  I think it might actually be meant for an espresso maker though.  The taste is comparable to Jacobs Kroenung or Douwe Egberts coffee.

review/summary: Picky cat loved this!
review/text: I've spent years trying to figure out what my cat likes.  I thought I had narrowed it down to chicken, but he eventually got sick of that too.  Based on previous purchases I was sure he hated all seafood except for tuna water.  Being that Tiki has a lot of tuna mixes, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Amazingly, he loved it!  I was really surprised since the brand of chicken he likes also makes quite a few seafood varieties that he did not like.  For whatever reason, he seems to enjoy every seafood variety in this pack (but not so much the chicken, as it's a lot drier in comparison to his usual chicken in gravy). He's still insanely picky and doesn't like the same food several days in a row, but I can combine even a little bit of this with his other foods and he'll eat it.  Very happy with this find!!

review/text: I have a cat who has to have a calorie-restricted diet and was not doing well on the Rx food from the vet. Much heaving and discomfort. I switched brands, this, that, the other and no food seemed to help. This is the only brand that keeps him in good trim, with no dry heaves. It's basically fish or chicken, fish oil and that's about it. There are a few varieties with a bit of rice.<br /><br />The food looks like tuna or chicken salad and the cat LOVES it. I am sure I gave him extra years of life by putting him on this food.

review/summary: My Cat loves this stuff...
review/text: My 13-year old male cat has been a non-fish eater his whole life. I decided to upgrade the quality of his food and bought a sample pack of Tiki Cat. He went wild. There is quite a variety and he favored some much more than others. But the best way to find out is get a sample pack and see what he/she likes.<br />Theres a variety of tuna combinations, calimari, sardines, mackeral, lobster and crab. The fish is very fresh and apparently fished in low mercury oceans so you can relax about the amount you feed your kitty.<br />Our cat now demands fish nearly every day. We still feed him other high-quality cat foods, but most of the time...it's Tiki.

review/summary: Too much fish for a variety pack, but....
review/text: I bought this variety pack so my cats could try the chicken flavors without fish, but they hated it. However, they did like a couple of flavors...so I will order those (if I can remember which ones! argh)<br /><br />My BIG questions/concern: the fine print on the bottom of each can says "feed one can for every 3 lbs of bodyweight daily"...<br /><br />One of our cats weights 16 lbs (Maine Coon) and the other, 12 lbs, so I will need to feed a total of 9 cans/day. (who can afford that?) This MUST be wrong info?<br /><br />What cat would eat that much food in one day?<br /><br />Makes me question the company. (they also included one flavor that had menadione sodium bisulfate - a known carcinigen - listed on the can, but when I called I was assured they eliminated that from all flavors last year, and that they just haven't "caught up" with new labels yet.  hmmmmm.<br /><br />If you are feeding this food, do YOU feed according to the label instructions?<br /><br />I've been feeding/offering 1-2 cans of Fancy Feast Classic/day to my 2 cats, but they never finish it.<br /><br />Why do I need to almost triple that amount of Tiki Cat?  (I do put out high quality (40% protein) kibble 24/7.  A good quality, high protein kibble fills up cats in all the right ways, so one expects them to eat less. My cats only eat 1/2 cup of kibble/day (that's total for both, not each cat!)  Seems way too little, but they maintain their weight just fine on it and the FF. So, I have to wonder about how TikiCat came up with the huge amount needed to feed?<br /><br />I'd love to hear what others do. If cats "need" that many cans of TIKI CAT, then each can must be very low on nutrients, as I assume to get the proper nutrients, they need all those cans as per the label?  I hope someone can make sense out of this.  I emailed the company just now as I totally missed that last line until placing an order for Hookena Luau, Hana Luau & Napili Luau. (some of their cans have better (safer) ingredients than others; and those are the more expensive ones & of course those are the ones I will feed IF I find out I don't need to follow the feeding guidelines.....)

review/summary: Might make your plants happy if you gave it to them. Or it might kill them. Not sure...
review/text: Wow, if this is the only thing you can get in Europe, I feel sorry for them. After trying this for myself, I suspected that those high ratings were only illusions. My husband told me that company's consider these reviews as just another form of advertising and pay people to lie about a product's quality. I really can't imagine anyone thinking this product is drinkable, let alone, pleasurable. If you want a couple recommendations on decent tasting t-discs for your Tassimo machine, the Jacobs Latte Macchiato isn't bad if you add sugar. This morning though, I drank it after I tried the Voluptuoso and my mouth has a metallic taste to it. Not sure which one is responsible. Another thing, the milk in the disc tastes sour, but when you add sugar, there is a decent flavor there. For the 2nd decent beverage, you can take the Kenco Crema with some Coffee Mate's Spiced Pumpkin and Vanilla Spiced Chai (a liberal amount) creamers, with enough sugar, and have a nice smooth cappaccino. I've tried about nine flavors now, and the coffee, cremas, most lattes and cappaccinos, have the same inferior quality in looks and taste, as a cheap instant coffee, as well as, having your mouth taste like you just drank the contents of an ashtray. Kenco Crema is the only one that did not taste like nicotene. These are the coffees I've tried: Gevailia Cappaccino, Maxwell House - House Blend, Hag Crema Decaf, Jacobs Kronung, Carte Noire Voluptuoso Classic, Kenco Crema and Jacob's Macchiato. After finding one inferior brew after another, I've given up looking for a good cup of black coffee and/or cappaccino, for the Tassimo. Don't do what I did, which was believe all the positive reviews and downplay the critical reviews. My curiousity has been appeased after spending $34 in Tassimo beverages. Thankfully, 2 packages were free. Now I can either spend more money in S&H to return them, or drink all 56 cigarettes...coffee I mean.

review/summary: Wonderful for a sensitive stomach
review/text: My 8 yr old Siamese, Random, has always had stomach issues. He has trouble with hairballs and he tends to eat too quickly, which results in the food coming right back out. He's been on prednisolone since he was young to control his vomitting.  Since I switched him to Royal Canin Special 33, I've been able to reduce the dosage of the prednisolone and he vomits less often!  He doesn't vomit right after eating anymore either.  He's perkier than he has been in years and he looks fantastic.  His coat is good, his eyes are bright.  Our other cat Nimitz, a 2 yr old Norwegian Forest cat, shares this food and he looks fantastic too.  It's not the cheapest food I've ever bought, but it's worth every penny to me!

review/summary: Incomparably Delicious
review/text: When I was very young, this was a candy which I could find in my grandmother's crystal candy dish, regardless of the time of year. Their smell and taste is an amazing memory trigger, taking me back to days of fresh cinnamon toast and a stereo phonograph player in a five foot by two by two foot console. These are perfection. You'll find imitations all over the place--AVOID AVOID AVOID. Spend a little more (not a lot more) and stick to the original Necco deliciousness.<br /><br />One recommendation: If you're not a 9 year old child with a sweet tooth, you probably won't go through 84 ounces of sugary goodness before the candy's natural hydrophilic quality will have overpowered the original packaging, turning some of the candies into jawbreakers. Fear Not! Open the original packaging and store in a vacuum-popped tupperware container (or vacuum-sealed bag, if you've one of those contraptions) and all will be perfect.

review/summary: These other reviews are too kind.
review/text: Let me preface this by saying that I rarely have enough of an opinion about a canned soup, one way or the other, to take the time to post a review about it.  But with Puck's smug mug on the can and the galling discrepancy between the pretentious language on the label and the swill inside, I couldn't resist.  Let's see: "Vibrant, innovative approach."  "Robust flavors."  "Trademark passion and uncompromising quality."  "The most delicious tastes to savor."<br /><br />This is by far and away the worst clam chowder I've ever tasted.  I've had better New England clam chowder at crap roadside diners in Michigan.  I've gotten better clam chowder out of Campbell's Soup cans, at a fraction of the price.  This is a thin, flavorless gruel with a few denatured potato cubes swimming forlornly among a couple of minuscule pieces of clam.  It doesn't even taste salty (and with 25% of the US RDA of sodium per serving, you'd think it might have at least THAT going for it).<br /><br />The fact that they pass this monstrous garbage off as "organic" and "natural" vividly demonstrates this company's contempt for the American consumer.<br /><br />Wonder if Puck has ever tasted this fine product that bears his name.

review/summary: Fresh and delicious
review/text: I was nervous about buying a whole case of these circus peanuts, and I groaned when I opened the box and discovered all the peanuts in each bag were clumped together. But luckily, the peanuts separated easily, and they taste fresh and delicious, with that wonderful spongy give and banana flavoring.<br /><br />I bought these to use as balloon weights for a carnival-themed party. I filled small tin pails with circus peanuts and tied balloons to the handles, and I left some unopened bags as decoration on the tables. While everyone thought they were cute, I only saw two people (out of sixty guests) actually eat any. I guess most adults don't like them. But if you do, I think you'll be happy with this brand.

review/summary: Cheaper to buy individual bags than one large bag!
review/text: My husband loves Circus Peanuts (yes, he's probably the only adult I know who likes them!), so I purchased this as a fun part of his birthday present. This product is not one large bag, but 12 snack sized bags. My husband preferred them this way because he could take them to work or wherever and they are already portioned for him. I also compared prices, and at the time I purchased these, it was actually cheaper to get the indvidual bags than to buy one large bag.

review/text: I purchased them to give as a gift since they are not the candy that I crave what-so-ever. My brother loves 'em, I hate them.
