review/text: This is by far the best flavored decaf I've ever drank. The smell and flavor are delicious without the chemical or burnt taste some decafs have. Now I just gotta get Perfect Potful to make k-cups, because I recently switched to that type of coffee maker. But I suppose they'd have to re-name them 'Perfect Cupful' then, wouldn't they!

review/summary: Should be complete
review/text: Makes great tasting pancakes.<br /><br />But it should be a "complete" mix.  Meaning all you add is water.  It requires eggs/milk/butter/pumpkin puree.  Heck, all they added to generic pancake mix was some spices & a sprinkle of oatmeal flakes.  I expect more from a $9 box of pancake mix.

review/text: Not much to say about the actual product -- who doesn't like M&M's?  One of life's simple treats that always hits the spot.<br /><br />I ordered this on a price dip which put it below what the warehouse clubs typically sell the big bags for. It's not a good value, however, at the regular price -- you can do a lot better at a brick and mortar store.<br /><br />Love them as-is or mixed in with ice cream. (Or, for that matter, mixed in with pretty much anything). Easy way to get a quick chocolate fix.

review/summary: Good source for plain M&Ms
review/text: My husband likes M&Ms.  I used to buy large bags of them in the grocery or drug store and then he would take his time eating them.  Then, they stopped selling them and just sold smaller bags at a much higher price per ounce.  When I found the larger bags on Amazon, it made me happy, especially since I can get it at a pretty good price.<br /><br />What else can you say about plain M&Ms.  Either you like them, or you don't.  If you do, then Amazon is a good source for them.

review/summary: Not quite a good experience
review/text: I placed my order and the experience was terrible.I bought the flowers with Amazon because i thought they would help in case there was an issue and they didnt. The flowers were not on time,i had a lot of trouble because the order wasnt delivered the first time and Proflowers had to send new flowers again with an appology note.The flowers were great but the hole experience was awful and i really had a bad time tracking the flowers through all US. First the UPS guys didnt find the address i wrote which i doubled checked on google and it was correct, then the flowers were sent back to Proflowers because they didnt find the address. It was a complete stress week trying to track with UPS, Proflowers etc where the flowers were. Amazon simply does not help with anything, its better buying your stuff on the Proflowers page only if you have need to buy flowers buy Internet.<br /><br />I think Amazon should take certain kind of responsabilty when things go not so well with a seller. I bought at Amazon not at Proflowers... If i wanted to buy at Proflowers i could of done it but i trusted the Amazon page first. Watch out with the image your leaving with your customers because first we are Amazon customers.<br /><br />About Proflowers i had to enter to their web page and had to contact them through Skype, they obviously appologized but they were helpful.<br /><br />Would i recomend this seller, flowers etc? Only if you dont need to get the flowers on a ceratin date because the flowers are beatiful but the timing is not so good. You have to be ver patient.

review/text: I've tried a few of the other Nong Shim noodle bowls, such as Kimchi, Seafood, and Beef & Ginger. This one's easily the best. The spices provide a suitably lobsterlike flavor that you'd expect from bowl noodles, it's sweet, and there's just enough spiciness to keep it interesting without putting your mouth on fire. Unless you really let the noodles sit in hot water for too long, they remain pretty firm for the meal. On top of that, the bits of cabbage and other veggies aren't much but add a nice extra crunch to the entire thing. Highly recommended.

This element is quite good as well.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed the level of heat in these noodles, and they never get old.<br /><br />Also I believe these noodles are supplied only from Korea unlike many of the other flavors carried by Amazon which are made here in the US.  I think everything is better with these noodles from Korea.  From the noodles to the packaging.

review/text: I don't get these other reviewers, but at least I know I'm not alone in that my wife also did not enjoy this product...<br /><br />1) There is no lobster in this soup and the flavoring is listed as an almost last ingredient - crab seasoning is listed much higher.<br />2) This tastes NOTHING like lobster and is a salty, flavorless mess. I love lobster as much as the next person, but this didn't even resemble lobster flavor.<br /><br />I'm not a picky eater and neither is my wife - but this soup was just not good at all. I've only tried one other Nong Shim bowl, the Spicy Chicken, and that one was pretty good. But the best one (by far that I've tasted so far) is the Gourmet Spicy Picante. It doesn't come in a bowl, but this soup is like night and day compared to the bowl soups. The flavor is better and the noodles are thicker and better tasting.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I bought this because I was curious about what a lobster flavored noodle would actually taste like. I figured it'd probably taste like spicy seafood, which is pretty good, so I gave it a go.<br /><br />It's not very spicy, especially compared to all the other spicy flavors Nong Shim offers. The original flavor is super spicy compared to this. I also really like the "hot and spicy" flavor, which is one of my staples (and favorites). The "kimchi" flavor is better than this (and it's also slightly spicier). I also have the "neoguri spicy seafood" flavor which is another one of my favorites and much better than this as well. Even the regular Nong Shim "seafood" flavor (that's not labeled spicy) is spicier than this for some reason. I was a college student once and ate lots of Nong Shim noodles (I still do, but not as much)....<br /><br />Basically, this was kind of a disappointment based on my expectations from the name of the product. It's not bad, but it's one of the less tasty flavors. It's nothing special or distinctive. The ingredients actually listed crab flavoring but not lobster flavoring, which I don't really care about as long as it tastes good. I still give this 4 stars because it's better than many many instant noodles from other companies. Nong Shim tends to get it right and this noodle pales only in comparison to other Nong Shim flavors.

review/summary: Good Stuff Maynard!
review/text: Received this one as a gift...actually it was a gift meant to be sarcastic as the giver of this gift knows I am a bit of a health nut and avoid candy for the most part.  Joke is on her though!  I am actually a closeted candy freak.  After she left and had received my outrageously squeaks of protest, I spent a pleasing evening making a total pig of myself.<br /><br />my little container contained among other things Jr. Mints, Tootsie Rolls, (yummers), Bit o Honey, Gummy Bears (gotta love them), and my mostest favorite of all...Atomic Fireballs!  Hey, does life in candy land get any better than this!  The candy was fresh and absolutely delectable.<br /><br />On top of it all I got this nifty little can that I can use to store my little treasures in.<br /><br />This was a great gift and I can see by the price listed here that my friend got off pretty cheap!<br /><br />This is good stuff and a good buy.

review/summary: Not her favorite, but it will do
review/text: I put this one into the mix for variety and although she ate it, it clearly wasn't her favorite.  I still buy it for my cat, but she'd rather have the cod, sole, and shrimp.  She likes the variety, but again, well, we'll eat it if that's what's on the menu, just don't give it to me every night.  The nutrition level of these varieties is very high, more palatable than Iams (they won't even go NEAR Iams!), and just an overall good food for your cat.  For that reason alone, and since she is a rescue, I buy her Fancy Feast.  Great food, highly recommend, but check someplace else for a better price!  This is about $6 more than what I pay for it at the grocery store here in goodl ole Ohio!

review/summary: Strong Oolong with Mint flavor and a hint of chocolate
review/text: I enjoy this tea.  However, it should be thought of more as a mint tea than a chocolate mint tea.  I was looking for a flavored Oolong tea since I prefer flavored teas and read that Oolong is much better than green for fat burning (by the way I've lost 30 pound in the last 6 months by drinking tea instead of my Starbucks mocha and removing artificial sweeteners, sugar and wheat flour from my diet so there is probably something to this). This has the potential to be a very strong tea, which I prefer.  The chocolate is most prevalent if you take the teabag early and opt for a weak tea.  Even then, it is just of hint of chocolate not a strong chocolate flavor.  As the tea sits longer, the mint and tea flavors tend to overwhelm the chocolate so there is just the barest hint left.  The mint flavor is definitely strong enough that you can sweeten with Stevia instead of sugar or artificial sweeteners and not notice anything wrong with the taste.

review/text: Unfortunately, I believed that by looking at the packaging, I was getting the OLD style gum, which has a lesser chance of sticking to the paper when carried in my pocket for a few days, than the new cheap gum.  I loose more gum now because it sticks to the paper after I've carried it in my pocket for a few days.  The old gum was less likely to stick to the paper under the very same conditions.<br /><br />Needless to say, I am quite dissapointed in Wrigley's decision to CUT the quality of their Doublemint Gum.  And also, needless to say, this will be my last purchase of ANY Wrigley's products.  They had a good gum before.  "If it ain't BROKE, don't fix it."

Do not expect the same kick as you would from beans with all of the sugar and caffeine.  A nice positive note, is that unlike regular beans these do not leave the little black expresso flecks between my teeth.  On the downside, I would prefer more of a dark chocolate taste and a bit more caffeine kick but I suspect this is the sacrifice for going sugar free.

review/text: These peanuts are very good...and the spices are just right.  The sodium on the can I bought is 190mg for 2 TBSP.  Either a previous reviewer got a can where the salt shaker was dumped into that particular can...or Paula Deen has reduced the sodium in these peanuts. Generally, I'm not a peanut lover...but I like these a lot.  They are seasoned just right (not too much stuff on them).  But...you do have to be careful about getting too much of the salt when you get to the bottom of the can (where the seasonings gather).  Otherwise...a great product that I highly recommend.

review/summary: Inedible Due to High Salt Content
review/text: I wanted so badly to love these peanuts.  The texture is absolutely perfect.  However, the salt quickly sneaks up on your.  They are over salted to the point eating them becomes physically painful.  Huge failure that could easily be turned into a success.

review/summary: Salty beyond belief!
review/text: Someone left a can of these in our work kitchen. I tried a few and I could not believe how salty they were. Looking at the Nutriton Information I found out why. 2300 mg of Sodium in a 2 Tablespoon serving size! I can't believe these are even allowed to be on the market without a warning. There is no reason to have this much sodium.

review/summary: Excellent dried porcinis for the price
review/text: I have been ordering these for a couple of years now, and have yet to find a better deal on dried porcinis.  These ones are the "middle" grade; I like them enough that I have not been tempted to try the higher grade. As with all other dried porcinis I have tried, both stems and caps are included.  For those of us who can't stroll down to the local store and buy fresh ones (and I expect there are many of you out there), I think these are a good way to go.

review/summary: Awesome coffee
review/text: This coffee is our coffee crack whenever we are in Europe. Usually, we get lazy (or really are on the go) and go for the instant version (die-hard coffee aficionados need not reply), as it's pretty awesome coffee, as well.<br /><br />We have since run out of our favorite carte noire instant coffee jars that we brought back with us, creating quite of a coffee fix dilemma! Should we fork out $15 for 100 grams of instant coffee (same brand) or should we break out the coffee press and buy 2 8.8 oz packages (about 500 grams total) of ground coffee of the same brand for $20.<br /><br />We have since been using the coffee press almost daily. Great coffee, for almost the grocery store price.

review/text: I love Celestial Seasoning's Madagascar Vanilla Red tea, which is sadly becoming harder and harder to find in stores.  But don't order this item.  I placed an order for it, and had the order randomly canceled by the company.  The seller was listed as ABC Wholesale, and it is now listed as RED TAG sale, even though it's the exact same item.  Buy it from another source, it's a great tea.  I personally think it works great in combination with other teas, my favorite is a combination of four bags of this tea and one bag of plum black tea to make a gallon pitcher, which tastes great both hot or cold.

review/summary: This Yerba Mate is a Keeper
review/text: Other reviewers have mention the fine particles in Guayaki Loose Yerba Mate, but all the Yerba Mate I've tried had some fine particles, and this does not bother me. Yerba Mate is actually made from the leaves and stems of the South American rainforest holly tree, so some dusty particles are bound to end up in the tea.<br /><br />Admittedly, I don't love the taste of Yerba Mate without sweetener and a bit of milk.  It does not taste like traditional tea, it has more of a green tea taste, but much earthier.  I do not find this tea to be bitter, but then I brew it appropriately: stir the tea in a small amount of cold water, then add 185 degree water.  I steep for 5 or more minutes, and if I steep for just 5 minutes, I find I can brew a second cup using the same tea by skipping the cold water and steeping for about 10 minutes.<br /><br />In my opinion, Guayaki Traditional Mate brews up nicely to a full-bodied tea that perks up my brain during afternoon energy slumps, without the upset stomach and "on edge" feeling that I get from coffee.  In addition to caffeine, Yerba Mate contains antioxidants.  I am on my second bag of this Yerba Mate, and I'm very happy with it.  This same tea is available in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028QDMY">Yerba Mate' Tea -Organic - 25 - Bag</a>, so if the fine particles bother you, the bags may be a better choice.

review/summary: Not authentic, but still very good
review/text: Guayaki is the most common brand of mat&eacute; on the market, and I bought it because of the good deal here.  Although there are more traditional brands out there with a much finer grind.  Other than that, I love mat&eacute;. I totally kicked my coffee habit without really even trying. It gives you an alert feeling, but much different than from coffee- you won't be jittery at all.  Great for elimination, but totally not like a laxative at all.  Make it as strong as you possibly can!

review/summary: My favorite US brand.
review/text: I started drinking Yerba Mate about 4 years ago. I used to only drink it terer&eacute; (cold) but I was shown a couple of hot preparations with milk and sugar that I really like so now I do it both ways; Hot in the winter and cold the rest of the time.<br /><br />I have tried about 10 different brands. Amazingly they all taste a bit different. This was the second brand I ever tried and it remains one of the better ones.<br /><br />Yerba Mate is a wonderful substitute for coffee or soda. It makes me feel good and gives me energy but doesn't spike me up and down like regular caffeine. My soda intake has gone to almost zero since I discovered this stuff.<br /><br />It is a bit of an acquired taste but I recommend trying it both hot and cold with the different methods available so you can experience the full spectrum of taste that is possible!

review/summary: Healthy, Effective Replacement for Coffee
review/text: I am one those people who lacks complete cognitive thought process until I have had my first cup of coffee. I usually follow it with a mid-day cup for added boost. Since, I've transitioned over to brewing yerba mate in my coffee maker I definitely feel a difference. I am energized mentally and physically. I remember where I park my car.  I can drink it alone, but I've added coconut milk and/or manuka honey for even more flavor before. By itself, it has kind of an earthy flavor. I am into that so it wasn't surprising, that isn't for you, but you want the benefits use your normal coffee embellishments (creamer, sugar, etc.) I can't even relay how much energy and focus this gives me. Not only am I alert, but I feel like I process information better. I'm not a morning person, but this gives me something to look forward to.

review/summary: powdery tea leaves
review/text: I love the taste of this mate, I love the company and what it stands for, protecting the enviornment & supporting organic farmers, the price here on amazon is really great, I took away one star only because most of my tea leaves were reduced to a very fine powder.  This was my second loose tea leaf purchase (I normally buy tea in bags) and the other loose leaf I bought (different brand, different site) had no fine powder.  So when I make the tea I get a lot of powder in my cup.  Not a huge deal, but I would prefer if the leaves were big enough not to leak through.  I'll probably buy this one more time & if I get the same thing I'll go back to the guayaki mate tea bags, which I love, I just wish they sold in bulk because I run out so quickly!!

review/summary: Tastes like green tea from the jungle
review/text: This stuff is hard to explain.<br /><br />It seems most similar to green tea, but it has an earthier taste, nuttier maybe. I drink it through a high quality stainless steel coffee-like filter rather than the traditional gourd and bombilla. The gourd and bombilla just seem like way too much trouble to me.<br /><br />I have read it has more anti oxidants than green tea, and judging from the thick cloud of green "tea" it can produce I don't doubt that. It actually has some identical antioxidant components that green tea has after I researched it, but they have different ones as well that I won't begin to attempt to understand or explain.<br /><br />It doesn't give me the nauseous feeling that I experience with green tea first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, which other of my friends say they get too if they drink green tea on an empty stomach. Also if you brew it too long, it will not get bitter like green tea gets, which is very nice.<br /><br />This stuff is advertised as having a different kind of caffeine that is more mellow. I do not believe that at all, this stuff gives a serious kick. If you have ever experienced a caffeine headache, this stuff can give it to you in a single strong cup. I do not drink soda by the way, but I do drink coffee, about once a week. This stuff seems at least as potent as espresso to me. I am not a daily intaker of caffeine, so my tolerance to it is probably quite low, but that is my experience.<br /><br />I like it to switch up my regimen of green tea, since I don't drink soda, or much coffee, or juice, drinking only green tea and water can get bland. And this stuff is a welcome change of pace that is a pleasant and mellow taste.

review/summary: read a newb's opinion
review/text: This is the first kind of yerba mate I ever purchased. I bought it at my grocery store, in the organic section. I didn't know what to expect. It is green and the size of the particles varies greatly. Some of it is actually a powder, and it sometimes seeps out of the infuser as you're brewing it. There are pieces of stem and the leaves are not cut to a uniform size.<br /><br />When you brew it, you need an infuser with a very fine mesh, and you can't submerge the infuser since stuff will leak out where it closes. You want a cylindrical infuser that opens at the top, and make sure the top of the infuser is not submerged. Don't try one of those round ones that closes like 2 halves of an egg, unless you want particles in your drink. There are special gourd things you're supposed to use, but I haven't tried those.<br /><br />Find a good place to let the infuser drain. It will leave a dark green stain on whatever it sits on while it drains. This stain will probably wash out, but you need to watch out for it. If you spill any of the powdery particles of th dry mix, and then if they get wet, they will make the same kind of stain.<br /><br />Having said all of this, I liked the taste and I used up two 16 oz. packages of this in just a short while. I looked around for a cheaper option and tried another brand.

review/text: This is my first experience with Yerba Mate tea.  I bought it for health reasons.  It contains B 1 and 2, riboflavin, carotene, iron, potassium, magnesium, 15 amino acids and other things I can't remember.  Google it and you'll see what a power house it is.<br />It improves digestion, mental focus and supposedly helps diminish food cravings.<br /><br />I made my first pot yesterday and I'm enjoying another today.  I like the taste of it - I don't think it's grassy as other people do.  To me it has a slight spicy after taste.<br /><br />It's from the continent of the Amazon River - sold on amazon.com - HA! - good grief I'm easily amused.....<br /><br />Steeped in hot - not boiling water.  That's good for me because I don't think I let water  boil in the microwave.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for taste, health benefits and the fact that it's a sustainable product from the Rain Forest.
