review/summary: Sent my blood sugar through the roof!
review/text: These cookies taste OK. You're not going to mistake them for regular cookies, but they're good enough.  They're about the size of a quarter.  My type 2 diabetes is well controlled and I rarely have numbers over 130 anymore even after a meal.  I ate just six of these cookies and my count shot up to 200!  I could have eaten a couple of much larger and tastier "normal" cookies and not had a reading that high.  So, if you want to try these, don't buy a large supply until you are sure they won't do the same thing to you.

review/summary: Lemon Cookies are OK,  but no so for Pecan Shortbread
review/text: I tried to email my complaint to the address printed on the package,  but that email is no longer active,  then I called the number listed,  asking for the new address and a call back  .... NONE CAME !<br /><br />I opened a bag of Pecan Shortbread (no date code listed on the package),  it smelled rancid ... and stale ... and out of one of the cookies,  a long hair pertruded.  Had to take the microscope to find any resemblence of crushed pecans or even the slightest nutty taste.  Suffice it to say,  this product is just plain aweful.<br /><br />Can't mess up on Lemon  ...  but because of my experience,  I've asked World Market to stop selling the Pecan Shortbread.  I sure won't buy any more.

review/text: All of a sudden this tea is no longer on the supermarket shelves.  Luckily I was able to get it on Amazon.<br />I will buy more since I think this is the best tasting tea there is and I don't have to add lemon which causes too much acid in my system.

review/summary: cheese and pickle please
review/text: I remember being a Brit transplanted in a small, conservative, wasp town in Massachusetts.  The first time I went to school with a cheese and pickle sandwich I was inundated with disdainful remarks.  However, I am 20 years older now, and still truly enjoy the special taste.  I have taught my first Americans to enjoy it too.  So my youngsters now take the same lunch.  Fantastic after all these years.

review/text: Just returned from a trip to Scotland where I was introduced to Branston Pickle by our most-gracious host.  I love this stuff.  It's got tang.  It's got crunch.  It's got lots of flavors.  As a vegetarian I am always looking for ways to make vegetables more interesting.  Due to the ridiculous weight and "liquid" restrictions on the airlines, I could bring home only one jar of Pickle so I am delighted to find it is available on Amazon!

review/summary: Eating UK
review/text: I bought Branston Pickles after finding it in Gordon Ramsay's recipe for Shephard's Pie. It is delicious and unlike anything available in the US. I have used it in my own version of Gordon's recipe, albeit a cottage pie instead - beef versus lamb. I have put this atop beef pot pies to "kick it up a notch." It would also be a great topping for pinto beans served with corn bread. My mother made a homemade relish that was amazing and this is the only product that I have ever bought that reminds me favorably of her "relish." This is an inexpensive way to experience another region's cuisine.

review/text: Another one of those uniquely British oddities that make most Americans barf.  I have lived in this country for more than half my life, and I guess as I close in on my 67th year, I'm reverting to my English childhood.  Cheese and Branston pickle sandwiches on home-baked bread were among the great treats of my youth, along with pork scratchings and bacon that actually contained meat.  We're baking our own bread again and American cheddar (the aged white variety they make in Washington and Vermont and Canada too) is almost as good as the real thing, so when I saw this deal I couldn't resist it.  Thanks, Amazon - I really don't know how we ever managed without you!

review/summary: The best chutney in the world!
review/text: I'm a Brit by birth and grew up in England during WWII.<br />If I couldn't buy Branston pickle in the USA I have to seriously think about going back to the UK.<br />Branston pickle is very unique, its recipe goes back to the days when Britain was a great power and ruled over India which was called the Jewel in Queen Victoria's crown. The pickle is basically an Indian chutney formulated to meet the British taste. When I use it the most is on one of my favorite sandwiches which is Cheese and Branston pickle. My wife also makes a delicious cheese Quiche from time to time and I have to have Branston with my quiche. As others have said, anyone that has stopped by a British Pub at lunchtime and had a Ploughman's lunch has already had the pleasure of tasting this fine product. Two other tasty products you may enjoy are HP sauce and Pickled Onions.

review/summary: A taste of hot, without the heat
review/text: I have been using this product for 20 years. I can attest to the fact that it has a very long shelf life, because I bought all mine at the same time, from a store that was getting rid of it, and my latest bottle tastes just like the first one.<br /><br />The best thing about this oil is that it gives you the taste of heat, but not the actual heat. The name is somewhat misleading. To me, it is not hot at all, but tastes like it should be. I love it for spicing up soups, etc., when I am not in the mood for burning throat and watering eyes, which I am sometimes! Makes an excellent substitute for Tabasco, and doesn't have the vinegar base. It is of course oil based.<br /><br />Try it!

review/summary: Milder than most of the bold flavors with a slight  zing of lime citrus flavor!
review/text: These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!

review/summary: Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?
review/text: These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. "BOLD" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!

review/text: I love these Blue Diamond Almond snacks and I particularly like the bold flavors.

review/text: Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.<br /><br />The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!

review/text: I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I've never seen the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor at the local grocery store so when I saw them on Amazon I decided to buy them.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. This is right up there with my favorite flavors. It has just enough heat and jalapeno flavor with just a little bit of smoke. To me, these have almost as much heat as the Habanero flavor. Which isn't a bad thing. I like spicy.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend these if you like the Bold line of Blue Diamond Almonds.

review/summary: Not habanero-y at all, but still insanely addicting
review/text: The heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.<br /><br />Satisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.<br /><br />Blue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard.

Its a nice balance.<br /><br />I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about "bowel tolerance" or "happy bowels" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

review/summary: Best flavor and best price of any Blue Diamond almonds!
review/text: The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable.

review/summary: Perfect Treat - Perfect Heat
review/text: I was concerned that these might be too hot, 'Habanero', but the heat is perfect as is the flavor... they are bold, if you like stuff plain--these are not for you... but if you like a robust flavor, a definite must!  Took some to the office and my office is all addicted by these now, you can't eat just one.  From a texture perspective, they are perfectly roasted - not chewy and not powdery, they are crisp.  I'm on a Paleolithic 'Paleo' diet and nuts like these are okay for me to eat - so they make a great treat.  I've gone through 7 bags in 3 months (sharing, of course)... I definitely recommend.

review/summary: Highly addictive! Great with beer
review/text: I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!

review/summary: Wasabi Lovers Rejoice! These Wasabi SoySauce Blue Diamond Almonds Taste Fantastic!!
review/text: Hello everyone, I just had to write a review for these Wasabi and Soy Sauce flavored Blue Diamond Almonds, because I enjoy them sooooooo much! I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!

My boyfriend, who doesn't like sushi, really enjoys these too, so they aren't just for sushi lovers.  I believe they are roasted, so they are not as healthy as raw almonds, but they still make a great afternoon snack.

review/summary: The best almond flavor out there. How could something so delish be so good for you?
review/text: The "Jalapeno Smokehouse" flavor is the best flavor in the Blue Diamond "BOLD" series, hands down. Unlike some of the other flavors, this one really tastes like what it's supposed to taste like -- that is to say, smoky jalapeno peppers. To my jaded taste buds, the pepper spice is fairly mild, but I imagine most people find it packs quite a kick. It's a good thing these huge, perfectly roasted nuts are great for you, because I eat them constantly. Hey, my HDL cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol) has actually risen as I've gotten older. I like to think it's partly because of these luscious babies. Dr Jeddy prescribes a handful every day!

review/summary: Not as crunchy as the other Blue Diamond flavors
review/text: I'm addicted to Blue Diamond almonds. I've tried all the flavors -- and this was the last one I tried. I love salt, I love vinegar, and I love salt-and-vinegar potato chips, so how could I lose with these?<br /><br />Well, I'm just not that into them. The flavor's great and the almonds are fresh, but somehow the texture just fails. The almonds just seem... soggy. They don't have that wonderful crunch that the other Blue Diamond flavors have. And that flattens out the whole experience of eating them. I've eaten about 10 bags so far, and they all have the same lackluster texture.<br /><br />Oh well. Guess even my ol' reliable Blue Diamond can't hit it out of the park every time.

review/text: I don't know what they put in these things, but whatever it is it's addictive. The combination of soy sauce salty and wasabi spicy create the perfect storm of "I'm going to eat this entire can RFN."<br /><br />The cans are all perfectly sealed and the almonds are always fresh - what else can you ask for? The cost is also lower than in local stores, but you can buy the larger bags cheaper (per oz) from some Walmarts if you can find them.<br /><br />Almonds are supposed to be appetite suppressants, but for me it's usually because I ate an entire can of them and am not hungry any more.

review/summary: Great Low Carb snack to go!!
review/text: Before we switched to eating low carb, we used to LOVE a nice big bag of chips.  I was missing those zesty salty crunchy snacks, until we found these delicious almonds!  I have tried all of the flavors and love them all, but these are my current favorite.  I like the snack size packs as a reminder that I have had enough since I can never stop eating them (just like potato chips, no one can eat just one).  A whole package is only  8 grams of carbs (only 4 grams of net carbs if you are an Atkins dieter).  These almonds have a nice crisp texture (even better if you put them in the refrigerator for a bit) and the seasoning is evenly distributed.  Not to strong, but also not too weak that it gets lost on the almonds. A package of 12 only lasted about a week in our home, back to order more.

review/summary: A healthy addiction
review/text: Not generally a big fan of wasabi or of almonds, but somehow find these particular wasabi and soy sauce almonds to be a healthy addiction. My doctor recommended almonds as an excellent low-carb, high protein, high fiber snack with heart healthy fat and this flavor is great to meet that suggestion while providing a nice savory and spicy snack with a little salty crunch.  A little bit spicy but not too much (I don't tolerate really spice foods well).  I tried the smokehouse flavor by the same brand and didn't like it, but I could live on these wasabi and soy sauce almonds. The soy sauce flavor is hardly noticeable but just nicely tones down the heat of the wasabi.

They are not as "hot" as wasabi peas, a more gentle kick.  I highly recommend them. Very savory.

review/summary: LOOOOVE these almonds!
review/text: I am so thrilled to find these on Amazon! I don't know why it didn't occur to me to look earlier. I love salt and vinegar potato chips and these definitely hit the same flavor spot. But it's a much healthier alternative. They are still high in fat, as all nuts are, so eating a whole can in one sitting is probably not the thing to do. But a handful in the afternoon really takes care of my salt craving, the bold vinegar flavor makes a little go a long way and I'm getting some good nutrients too. As others mentioned, of all the "bold" flavors, this seems to be the one that is hardest to find in stores. Thank you, Amazon!

review/summary: Best Almonds Ever
review/text: I recently discovered the Salt & Vinegar Almonds they are delicious. The individual size is perfect for when on the go. I also purchased the cans for at home. Almonds are a very heart healthy snack, just try to limit yourself to a few a day. For my taste I would like to have more vinegar flavor.

review/summary: Perfect snack, perfect size!
review/text: I love salt and vinegar chips, but never feel full even if I eat a whole bag.  (and I will!!!)  I thought the idea of salt and vinegar almonds sounded gross, but was willing to give it a try.  And boy they are great!  They have about twice the vinegar punch of most chips, and are amazingly good, and the fat is the good kind, and you get plenty full on the almonds.  Mmmmmm.<br /><br />I was buying the tins (which are sometimes available at the grocery store), but then realized I couldn't stop once I opened a tin and was eating something like 1,200 calories in a single day just on almonds.  So these packs are perfect - there are enough almonds to really satisfy a hungry stomach, but not so much to blow your diet.  And they're great to stash when you know that you won't be able to grab a real meal, but don't want to find yourself at a vending machine or 7Eleven buying crap b/c you're so hungry.  Even my (naturally thin) hubby loves them.  Perfect!

They have the nice fresh-tasting almonds you expect from Blue Diamond, and you can actually taste the wasabi (unlike the jalapeno smokehouse, where the jalapeno part is really elusive).<br /><br />I was reluctant at first to try this. Didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong. Terrific snack almonds (if you don't mind saltiness). Love em.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: You can definitely taste the salt & vinegar
review/text: Even though I (thought) I hated them for 25 years, I am a recent convert to the great taste and nutritional value of almonds. It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too "dry," some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are "too" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12.

review/summary: A nice enough flavor, but I wouldn't describe it as either "Blazin'" or "Buffalo Wing."
review/text: I'll start off by noting that I love almonds, I eat almonds every day, and I particularly love Blue Diamond almonds. The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.<br /><br />And I've tried all their flavors, especially their "BOLD" line. Alas, their definition of "BOLD" is apparently "a little too spicy for kids." This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-"blazin'." It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.<br /><br />As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>. But it doesn't taste much like anything in particular. They could have called it "BOLD Generic Faux-Spicy Snack to be Eaten Brainlessly While Watching the Game" flavor and it would have been more accurate.

review/text: Ordered these because I wanted to try them and none of the stores in my area seem to carry them. Normally I eat the habanero bbq or the wasabi.<br /><br />For spiciness they are better than the habanero but not as much as the wasabi can be (though in all fairness the wasabi is in a whole different taste spectrum anyway)<br /><br />Flavorwise is where they lose out. They taste MUCH saltier and the flavor itself is overpowered by that until you get to the end zing where the spice kicks in.<br /><br />In summary, they are edible and I will finish off the cans that I ordered but I will go back to purchasing my wasabi and habanero after that.

review/summary: Not As Balanced As Other Bold Flavors, But Not Bad
review/text: I went out on a limb trying Blue Diamond Almonds Bold - Wasabi & Soy flavor.  I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other "Bold" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try.  The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the "soy" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!

I had never seen the Blazin' Buffalo Wing flavor at the local grocery store so I ordered them here on Amazon.<br /><br />When you first put an almond in your mouth you get the initial hint of buffalo wing flavor but it quickly goes away and then just tastes kind of strange.<br /><br />They aren't bad but they aren't my favorite. Every bodies taste buds are different so you might like them but I don't think I'll buy this flavor again.

I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that.

You can eat 'em by the handful, and probably will once you taste them.<br /><br /> However, true hot-pepper fans know that the heat of the Habanero pepper is a fearsome thing. You won't find much of it here, just a little hint. That's probably for the best, given that most people can't tolerate the blazing intensity of those devilish little peppers. But I kind of wish Blue Diamond would put out a "BOLD, and This Time We Mean It" line for those of us who really do love spicy foods.

This price is better than I get them at Wally World for the 6oz can and they are cheaper there than anywhere else. So, buy these, buy them now and hide the other bags from yourself (or send them to me) ...they are SO good, I'm eating them now! :<br /><br />Hey Amazon, this is sold and shipped by you, it would be ever so nice if this came on the subscribe and save!

review/summary: A Great Spicy, Healthy Snack!!
review/text: Blue Diamond Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are a great snack.  Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts that you can eat, and the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor is very similar to chipotle.  This isn't too surprising since a chipotle is a smoked jalapeno after all.  From a nutrition stand point, the only special consideration that doesn't come will all almonds is the 180 mg of sodium per serving.  Unless you get a plain, unsalted nut this is pretty typical.  I like to keep a can of these either in my desk or in the pantry at home for snacking.  Grabbing a handful of these is great between meals when hunger strikes.  So if you are looking for a spicy snack that is fairly healthy, give these a try.

review/text: I absolutely love these salt and vinegar almonds!!!<br />Being a fan of salt and vinegar potato chips when I saw these I knew I had to try them. Finished off the can within a couple days!! These are truly very good!!  My only problem is I couldn't find them again in any store around here so I remembered my fav place to shop Amazon.com and knew they wouldn't fail me! Thank you!!

review/summary: reallllllly good
review/text: first of all -- they're good.  really good.  go back for more and lick the bowl when they're gone - good.<br /><br />That said -- they're not quite as bold as you might hope.  I mean -- I'm from Texas.  Bold should be really BOLD.  But they are good -- so we'll just overlook it.  Yummy.<br /><br />And they are almonds -- one of those wonder nuts so full of B vitamins and other good stuff that you should be eating an ounce a day just for health sake.  But they're good enough that it's not exactly an intelligence test whether you'll want to eat them.

review/text: Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about "bowel tolerance" or "happy bowels" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.  I realize that taste is a personal thing.  That's why they make chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla.<br /><br />Here's my current favorites"<br /><br /> 1st Blue Diamond Dark mint dark chocolate (reminds me of the chocolate mint Girl Scout Cookies with less sugar).<br /><br />2nd Blue diamond Dark Chocolate Oven Roasted<br />3rd  Blue diamond Blue Butter Toffee<br />4thd Blue Diamond Almonds Bold Habanero BBQ (reminds me of  BBQ potato chips again with less sugar).<br />5th Bold Blazin Buffalo Wing<br />6th Blue Diamond Almonds Cinnamon Brown Sugar<br />7th  Blue Diamond Almonds Lime `n Chili<br />8th  Blue Diamond Almonds Smokehouse<br />9th  Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce<br />10th Bold Salt & Vinegar<br /><br />But that's just me: you might have a completely different take on these flavors.<br /> 4th  and 5th are very close.<br /><br />Gunner<br />May, 2012

review/text: These almonds are my favorite flavor from Blue Diamond. Not too sweet, not too spicy. More sweet than spicy though so I wouldn't be afraid of getting it even if you can't normally handle spicy foods.

review/text: These almonds are very tasty.  I eat them alone and sometimes mix them with plain Greek yogurt for a delicious and healthy treat.  You can't find this flavor in most stores and the typical Blue Diamond can is much more expensive else where.

review/text: Wow is what you'll say when chomping on these nuts.  They're very tasty and addictive, as stated in the other reviews.  If you like wasabi or horseradish, you'll love these.  My mom says almonds help you sleep and for the last week I've slept great.  If you like bold flavor, I strongly recommend them.
