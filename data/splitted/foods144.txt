review/summary: Wow
review/text: I read many recommendations for Maldon and how it is a great finishing salt.  Looked all over at my local Whole Foods, grocery stores and gourmet shops.  Whole Foods didn't carry it and the gourmet shop sold it for much more than Amazon.  So far I have used it on sauteed and roasted vegetables and a tomato and cucumber salad - delicious and a noticeable difference compared to the regular sea salt I was using (Kirkland brand).

review/summary: Best salt around!
review/text: This salt is great! Not meant as a cooking salt, this is to be sprinkled on food as a finishing salt. It gives a wonderful salty taste to nearly anything, even if little or no salt is used in preparation. I use far less salt when cooking but still have the taste. Other sea salts I've tried are too hard and crunchy. This one has very thin pyramid-shaped crystals. It adds perfect crunch and flavor to meats, vegetables, and salads.

review/summary: Don't care for taste
review/text: I heard Maldon was supposed to have a wonderful taste. After using it for a while, my husband and I don't care for the tast so much. As far as the use of it, I was under the impression it was to be used in cooking, but heard later it was for garnishing on a finished plate. When added to a pan to saute, it takes alot longer to melt than kosher salt. Some of the thicker flakes never melt completely, so we get a mouthful of large salt flakes with some bites of our meal (which I don't like). Used as a garnish, it looks cool but again, it's way to salty and thick for me to eat. The flavor is a very clean, super salty taste- more salty than the other sea and kosher salts we use. I know it is very popular so I am probably one of the few that doesn't care for it.

review/summary: My 3 dogs are in love!
review/text: I ordered this as I do not like feeding my dogs junk.  I read the ingredients and decided that even though it's pricey it would be worth it for the pooches.  I have to say, they are crazy about it right away.  The smell is a bit powerful when the bag is opened, which immediately attracted their attention.  They each took a taste and I swear, they smiled!  I also ordered the duck formula; can't wait for that to arrive too!<br /><br />I have a Chihuahua, a Maltese, and a Beagle.  Each of them thinks this is absolutely divine. My dogs are self feeders, meaning there is always a bowl of dry food available to them.  They share one bowl quite happily.  A nibble here, a nibble there.  They are so pleased and I am too, knowing that they are eating something that is both nutritious and healthy.  None of them has a grain issue, I just prefer feeding them more meat than fillers.  Buy it, your dogs will love it!<br /><br />Now, to keep the cats away...

review/text: Ordered this because I've enjoyed Japanese-style curry when I can find it, and used Golden Curry in the past to make it at home.  Never found the mild variety here, so I ordered this along with the medium-hot (which I haven't tried yet).  The mild is hardly even a curry in terms of flavor, it's more like an extremely thick sort of gravy.  It's not bad by any measure, but it's hardly worth picking up if you're a fan of Japanese curry.  Go for something with higher heat, unless you've got kids around with sensitive taste-buds or something like that.

It's actually disgusting.  Hate to give something a terrible review, but it's just yuck. I like oil fine, where it belongs (french fries, maybe a salad?), but not in dried fruit.  They've managed to get rid of the sulphur and whatever else just to jam them full of sunflower oil (a preservative).  I'd rather just have the fruit dried, in a fruit drier, or sun dried.  I'd even rather the things just crumble to dust in my mouth than this.  Organic or not, it's just oily junk food.

review/text: We've been looking for a way to obtain greaat anchony flavor that only anchovies can deliver. The cans are so expensive and you waste most of it as you only need a smidge of anchovy flavor to pick up any ssauce or pizza. My honey says she doesn't care for anchovies, they're too strong a flavor. When we used to get them on pizza that often was true as whole anchovies were strewn over the pizze(we go way back) It's amazing how everyone loves my pizza sauce and how tasty and full bodied it is, not bland. Thyme, oregano and basil can deliver just so much. We just don't mention the smidge of anchovy paste we put in it. It's a great product and in using a tube far less expensive as it stores well in the fridge. So great in flavor, so convenient in a tube with absolutely no waste, so easy to use EXACTLY  the amount you need, we very happy puppies in our house now.

review/summary: Good ingredients, bugs are common
review/text: I have purchased other potting mixes and been horrified to find bits of chewing gum, crushed tin cans, etc in them.  I've never had this happen with Miracle Gro.  Miracle Gro makes a good mix, at a decent ratio, which is great for growing most standard houseplants and excellent for growing from seed.<br /><br />As for the gnats:  Fungus Gnats can be found anywhere there is rot.  Don't clean your sink for a week - see those bugs?  Same thing.  They eat rot.  They cannot live in dry soil.  THE BEST PREVENTION for fungus gnats is to water with either a drip-irrigation system (plastic tubing with holes in it, hidden beneath the soil surface) or water bottom-up (water the dish under the plant, and let the soil soak the water upwards).<br /><br />The fastest and most common way to become infested is to overwater your plants.  I did this one year - we had them everywhere, in all our food, on the walls, and it was disgusting.  If you already have an infestation, try lowering the frequency of your waterings - your plants won't get dehydrated from a little less if the gnats have been happy with what they've had.  Let the soil top dry completely before you water - gnats and their young live near the top, in damp soil.<br /><br />Yes, I've seen more gnats with this than other soils.  However, that could easily have been because the batch I had had been kept more damp in the store than the other stuff.  Water less, you'll have fewer gnats.  Get Scott's and be prepared to be disappointed (that's the brand I found the crushed tin-can pieces and gum in).

review/text: I've always bought Miracle Grow, it WAS good.  The last 2 years it' has really gone downhill fast.  I've tried their potting mix, African violet soil and the worst of all, Moisture Control.  I also get gnats flying all around my house.  The soil is so bad!  I have found every thing from sticks to rocks in the soil.  And when watering plants, the water just sits there on top.  The soil doesn't soak up the water.  The African voilet soil also does not retain water, shoots right through to the tray and then won't soak it back up into the pot, the water just sits there.  The Moisture Control soil is a nightmare!  I've had plants actually rot at the roots, and I didn't water them for over 2 weeks!  My plants have never looked so sickly.  My husband laughingly looked at it the soil and asked me if I were planting my flowers in peat moss?  I didn't laugh.  The soil I bought just this weekend for outdoor pots, smelled horrible!  I had to keep the windows open during the trip home.  I've also opened bags of soil that had mold in it!  This company needs to change, change back to what they were previously 'cause I for one am going to look for a different brand.

I thought this was the best potting soil and paid more for it only to end up with gnats. Hundreds of them. I wish I had read the previous post before. Do not buy this product. Now it will cost me double to buy another brand and the work of repotting about 40 plants.

review/summary: Thousands of little bugs FREE with every bag!
review/text: We repotted about a dozen houseplants a month ago with Miracal Gro potting soil. I've sprayed the soil with indoor insecticide and these little bugs just look up at me a laugh. Insecticidal soap doesn't faze them either. Let's see... Miracle Gro is a division of Ortho and Ortho sells bug spray. Conspiracy theories anyone?

review/summary: Compost not potting mix
review/text: I keep buying a bag every year to see if they have changed their methods of production but as the saying goes "you get what you pay for". This used to be a great product but starting a couple years ago they stopped screening it. It is now at least a quarter woody material, 1/4-3inch pieces. This would actually be great for mulching trees and shrubs if it weren't way to expensive for that purpose. Spend the money, buy pro-mix and save yourself a lot of time and problems.

review/summary: Gntas  and wood chips.
review/text: I too have had tons of gnats come out of the potting soil.  Didn't they sterilize soil in the past?  I bought it to make grow grass seeds for the cats to chew on.I would spray it with bug spray but for the fact that I don't want to poison the cats. I've had some of the soil in planter for 2 months and its still making gnats.  I didn't have that problem with the soil that came with the Chia novelty cat grass seeds and soil.  The Miracle potting mix has a lot of wood chips in it.  I would prefer 100% soil instead of 25% wood chips that cause the gnats.  I guess Potting Mix is different than Potting soil.  I used to sell New Era potting soil that was good dark earth with nothing else added to it. Live and learn.

review/summary: yup gnats - lots of them....
review/text: I bought this potting mix a few months ago and about a month ago I started seeing the gnats, which have been increasing daily. My plants are indoors so I was wondering where they came from.  Yesterday I opened up the potting soil bag to repot a plant and found the inside of the bag crawling with the bugs. Maybe it was just a bad batch but I would suggest trying a different brand of potting mix to be sure.

review/summary: Don't use - especially in sun
review/text: I have 4 enormous ornamental planters in my gardens, which I have planted with purchased annuals for over 20 years. I am very experienced, and these planters have excellent drainage. This year, I switched the potting soil out for Miracle Gro Moisture Control. I flooded the planters before putting the plants in - several times. I planted them, and watered every single day from necessity. This soil product felt moist, but none was shared with the plants - their soil root balls stayed bone dry. The 2 planters in full sun had dying plants. I plunged my arm at least 25 inches down into the planters and the soil was hotter than beach sand, all the way down. This product somehow retains heat and was cooking my plants. When I removed this soil, I was surprised to find big pockets of it that were dust dry. The 2 planters in shade did a little better, but no plant growth whatsoever. Maybe if the plants grew in this from seed, they would do better, but you can't put plants in root balls into it - this soil just won't let the moisture leach into adjacent soils. And it cooks them. If your plants are still alive, rescue them and replace the soil. I don't know what this stuff is, but I would definitely not eat anything grown in it.

review/summary: No gnats for me!
review/text: I read all the reviews & bought this with quite a lot of trepidation.  Gnats are some of the most bothersome bugs on the planet, and I didn't want to have the same experience so many other people have had with this potting mix.<br /><br />I placed the order for this over the weekend & received it on the 25th.  I opened it today & was extremely relieved to find no gnats flying around inside the bag.  It's too early to say whether there will be, & I will update my review if I get any in my flower pots.<br /><br />I cannot testify to its growing power as it's the first time I've used Miracle-Gro, but I did notice an inordinate amount of settled soil in the bag.  I live with my grandma, and we both had to spend some time breaking apart the clumps before we could transplant one of her plants.  There were some twigs inside the bag, & I discovered one small rock, but nothing like what all the other reviews mentioned.  However, the soil was slightly damp & felt cool to the touch which was nice since it had been on the porch in the sun for 24 hours before I'd opened it.

review/summary: Good for container gardens
review/text: I like this potting soil for potting plants in containers.  The soil distributes moisture well, helping the plants stay moist on hotter days.  If I ever notice bugs, I just sprinkle some diatomaceous earth (seven dust) in with the soil; this usually kills off any infestations in the soil.  Then spray insecticidal soap on the leaves.  The best part about this soil is that it was delivered to my door!

review/text: I repotted all my house plants with Miracle Gro last year.  All got gnats and earthworms (potted plants don't like earthworms). My plants were never so unhappy and sickly.  Not sure that it was the soil to blame, I repotted all the plants with a fresh bag of Miracle Gro in spring  (after soaking the roots in water bucket overnight to get rid of the earthworms).  Still have gnat and earthworm problems.<br />So it seems that Miracle Gro did not just stop screening the soil.  The mix was not heat-treated properly to kill larvae and stuff. Do not use this brand, unless you want unhappy plants, gnat infestation, and earthworms!

review/text: We just went through a bout with fungus gnats and I kept shaking my head because I keep a clean house and don't overwater my plants.<br /><br />Asked the DH to pick up potting soil last week to repot my spider plant. Looked in the bag and there were bugs all through the soil as well as these tiny egg-looking bits. So I sprayed pyrmethrin in the bag and resealed it, hoping that would be a good fix. So far I have only seen 4-5 gnats but if I hadn't been in a bind I would have tossed the bag in the trash.

The plants look fine, but I have way fewer flowers than I've ever had using regular potting soil. I also had two plants die, and I have no idea why. I read one other review that said her plants were cooking in the sun - that the contents of her containers felt HOT to her. This could be my exact problem as well. Both plants that died were in full sun. Next year I will buy regular potting soil and a big package of Miracle Grow plant food instead!

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I bought the biggest bag of this stuff from Sears Hardware. I started about 20 plants indoors in the winter, all from seeds. I did not have the gnat or worm problems that others have wrote about so I am wondering if that is a problem with only bags bought online (for whatever reason). Anyways, I started a bunch of hanging spider pants, tomato plants, peppers, and corn. All grew excellent from seeds. However I had no luck trying to start an apple tree, which I tried to do several times from seeds. I also found that once your plant is established you should add some regular top soil to this potting mix. I kept the plants growing in the same mix for over 2 years, until they just outgrew their small pots. The soil did well. I plan on using it again.

review/text: Like the other reviewers wrote, GNATS!!!! I first noticed little clear worms in my soil, and soon I had little black flies buzzing around. I tried everything I could to get rid of them, including drenching the soil with chamomile tea (I know that moist soil helps them, but chamomile is supposed to kill the larvae), but last night I found more larvae in my pot! I sprinkled the surface with cinnamon, which I read helps, but I have little faith. One of my pots a strange green moss-like thing growing across the surface. I've since bought cheapo stuff that has no problem with bugs or moss! I didn't think I had to look up reviews for something like potting soil from a reputable company like Miracle-Gro, but obviously I was wrong. Stay away!!!

review/text: This soil is unpredictable, except that it's definitely deadly if you add fertilizer during the first two months.  By unpredictable, I mean even without adding fertilizer, it may burn your plants due to hot spots in the soil, where the 6 months of time release nutrients come out all at once.<br /><br />Don't use this on prize garden stock without testing first.  You simply cannot control the nutrient uptake with this potting soil.

review/summary: Gnats is Right!!
review/text: I re-potted all my plants in the fall of 2010 and spent a fortune all winter trying to get rid of these bugs! I never even considered the soil.. I thought I brought them in from a new plant purchase but couldn't understand how they could multiply so rapidly. When I heard my husband clapping his hands as they were flying around his desk downstairs (where there are no plants) I went into my potting room and opened the bag. BUSTED! I couldn't get that bag outside fast enough!<br />I ended up throwing out many of my favorite plants (some very old ones) and now I'm starting from scratch. In this case I didn't get what I paid for but a whole lot more than I bargained for!<br />As for the reviewer who claims it's from over watering...I can't agree.  I've been an avid indoor and outdoor gardener for over 30 years and I NEVER experienced anything like this.  Yes, be sure you have good drainage and don't water all plants the same. Different plants have different requirements. Maybe all bags aren't infested but I'll not take that chance again!

review/summary: Reading the label makes ME hungry!
review/text: So, I have an older indoor cat who has confined herself, more or less, to my bedroom, since our son was born a few years ago.  While in hiding, she put on a few pounds.  I got to thinking about this and the economy over the winter, and realized that it was better all around, to keep her healthy than to have an ailing senior kitty.  I did some research on what a quality cat food should be and came up with some qualifications and went shopping.  I returned with another brand- reasonably priced and fitting requirements.  My cat liked it alright.  And she lost some weight- fast.<br />  It was serious weight loss and I considered rethinking my own diet, but then we found she had fleas!!!  Poor thing had the worst flea infestation ever (ditto my closet and bedroom)!!!!  Apparently this can happen, even after ten years indoors, if outdoor humans bring flea eggs in on their shoes!!!  I'm told indoor cats often prove the worst flea sufferers- I believe it.  There is no where for them to run or hide.  The flea population explodes fast.<br />  She  dehydrated, anemic and completely exhausted, and dying,  I thought.  She had taken to staying on my window sill and would not touch the ground for anything (where fleas live), but of cousre that would be limitedly safe, too.  Well, I made some trips to the VET and pet stores,  and along with my flea aresenal I purchased some new cats foods to encourage her to eat.  I wanted  something with beef and liver, hoping  to help her get past the anemia.  Beef is harder to find than one might think, but there were a few, including Blue Spa.  I thought it a little expensive, but not when my first baby is so sick!  I opened it  first.  My desparate cat lept off the sill and ran to the kitchen- no lie!  It was the first decent meal she had eaten in days.<br />  Blue Spa Selects start with meat- be it fish, poultry or beef- not meat by products or broth.  The next ingredient is usually chicken and maybe liver.  After that is is a medley of nice vegetables and fruits and stuff-like sweet potatoes, wild rice, cranberries broccoli and blueberries.  The there's all the required nutrients and minerals and such. Sounds like a good meal, now doesn't it?  I admit, I found this concept a little over the top a few year back when I first heard of it.  But, you know, I have had cats who ate vegetables when the opportunity arose (I also had one who LOVED a nice coffee cake before company arrived).  When my sick kitty showed so much enthusiasm for this product, I realized that she must get bored with her food, same as I would.  All the good and different tastes in these little cans could be a new lease on life.  She is still quite thin, but gaining energy, looks good, and loves her new food.<br />  My only complaint is that the beef & liver variety is hard to find (not on Amazon, either, it seems).  We have tried the other flavors, now and they are equally loved.  Also- there's no ginger that I've seen, - a commonly complained about ingredient of a similar brand.  Will be trying other products from this company, soon, once I get rid of my fleas, too.

These are wrapped in powdered parchment and then an outer wrapper, easy to remove and pop in your mouth. And the Amazon 5-pack price cannot be beat. I paid over twice this price in a local health food store. Stock up - they have a long shelf life!

They wafers aren't crispy they're thicker and quite hard like a thin piece of plywood(i wish i was joking) I would have given them less but after i smothered one of the wafers with peanut butter it tasted kind of like a Peanutty Buddy but after buying these over a month ago, they still sit in my cupboard (and i have 7 kids :-(<br />and I wont even go there with the vanilla...

review/summary: Disappointingly thick and crunchy
review/text: What I like about wafers is the lightweight effect. Thought these would be similar to Manner wafers, with many exceedingly thin layers, however they are very different. The three wafers per piece are thick and crunchy rather than lightweight and paper-thin. In addition, the filling is scant and dry. The wafers lose their crispness very quickly when exposed to air, so must be eaten immediately upon opening. Given that these wafers have ingredients similar to those of the Manner competitor, they are overpriced and inferior in taste and texture. Other household members don't like them either, so I will have to give them away. Will not buy again.

review/summary: The return of the dark chocolate Kit Kat, but there's a catch
review/text: If you've ever had a dark chocolate Kit Kat, you know how good they are and how horribly difficult they are to find. (If you've never had one and you like dark chocolate, you must try it!). So, I was quite pleased to see that I could get them even it if meant having some white and milk chocolate coming along for the ride.<br /><br />But, if you're expecting an equal share of each variety in the bag, you'll be as disappointed as I was. Each bag has 50% milk chocolate, and only 25% dark and white chocolate varieties. Boo!<br /><br />Still, it's an opportunity to satisfy the craving for a dark chocolate KitKat. Since these go in and out of stock quickly, if it's available, you will want to order it promptly.

review/text: I lived in spain for a while and let me tell you, the chocolate I ate was not French or Belgian, it was dark chocolate kit kat bars. Although I admit the Swiss are parsecs ahead, these little dark kit kats are SO GOOD. The intense dark flavor and the rich creamy center to contrast it with... you add the awesome cookie wafer layers and you have a snack you can munch on a little at a time as a special indulgence! And the best part is you can chew it for a quick sugar rush or melt it away in your mouth and play with the flavors and textures for a long time!<br /><br />I thought I wouldn't find any locally until I saw this! This bag is a good price and has variety in it in case you get sick of the dark ones (who am I kidding that won't happen). The other kinds in this bag can help you ration out the dark ones better... OR... you can take them to work and "share" your stash (more like getting rid of the other ones while earning some points with your co-workers :P)

review/text: This is my favorite "assorted" candy ever!  I SO wish they'd release white or dark chocolate-only bags because these are the treats I look forward to all year.  We scour the local stores around Halloween and usually buy their entire stock.  I love the KitKat crunch and each flavor of chocolate makes picking a favorite difficult.  (Which usually means I have to eat three at a time *giggle*)  I'm glad to see Amazon has them in stock in case I can't find them locally; unfortunately, though, shipping them runs a risk of them melting, even in fall/winter. Alas, the chance would still be worth taking in order to get some this year. :)

review/text: I've purchased this item twice.  The first delivery was excellent in all respects.  The sun-dried tomatoes looked and smelled great, and they tasted even better - I ate many of them straight from the bag.  Unfortunately I re-ordered and the second shipment was awful.  The tomatoes were over-dried, dark brown in color, and smelled burned.  Worst of all they tasted horrible in everything I've tried to use them in so far.  Honestly I think I'll probably throw away the rest before I have to throw away any more dinners prepared with these.  A huge disappointment after my initial impression, and due to the cost of a 5 lb. bag.

review/text: If you're used to regular super-sweet gum, you may not like this because it has a little less flavor. You really do get used to it though and it's probably much better for your teeth.<br /><br />I started chewing this years ago when it was made with sorbitol. They've since reformulated it with xylitol and while it took me a little while to get used to it, I'm hooked yet again. I go through this stuff like it's candy! I literally chew a piece after almost everything I eat. It keeps my teeth clean and my breath a little fresher. The weird thing about this gum is that the flavor doesn't last very long. That's fine with me. I usually spit it out after 5-10 minutes.

review/text: Does what it claims to do. It helps clean your teeth while promoting fresh breath. The flavors are natural and delicious without being too sweet. They're crunchy on the outside, provided you don't get a stale pack, and then they become good and chewy. With two pieces, which is recommended, you can even blow a few small bubbles. This is the only gum we will chew ever since we discovered it at our local health food store and then, happily, started finding them for sale on Amazon.

review/summary: As good as the best BBQ sauce, maybe it is the best
review/text: I grew up in the South and in seemed that in every county I lived in or tried BBQ in, there were raging controversies over which county and which BBQ restaurant had the best BBQ sauce.  There were mustard based sauces (South Carolina) that were not sweet, sauces sweetened with various ingredients, all types of sauce use this method except perhaps vinegar based. My father grew up in North Carolina so when we went to visit my grandmother in Goldsboro NC we ate the BBQ there with a hot vinegar based sauced which was quite good.<br /><br /> In short, I have tried just about every sauce out there including Mustard, Ketchup, Tomato, Vinegar and even Mayonnaise based BBQ sauce.  I would rate this as one of the best if not the best I've ever tasted.  The reason I don't rate it as number one is that I now live in the northeast and don't have access to many sauces that I used to, but this sauce is just astoundingly good and I've tasted maybe a hundred sauces in my lifetime, perhaps more than a hundred but probably less than 200.<br /><br />  I haven't had an opportunity to eat a Mayonnaise based sauce in years and as far as I know, no one is making a Mayonnaise based BBQ sauce but I would rank this sauce from what I remember Mayonnaise based tasted like, as in the top tier with the home made Mayonnaise based sauce that a man I know used to make,  but I haven't had that sauce in more than 25 years.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this sauce.  Incidentally, how did Mr. Larry come up with the name "loose lipped"?  Does he talk a lot, gossip a lot, or is there some other secret behind the name that I'm missing?<br /><br />I have no affiliation with the company, have no interest in writing this comment other than I just love this sauce and I believe good things should be promoted.  And this sauce is more than good, it's exceptionally good, in the top tier with the best.  That's just my opinion though, try it for yourself.  You won't be disappointed.  The spice is slightly warm but not overpowering and if you're worried about it being too hot, you needn't worry.  This sauce is just slightly warm and that's one of its great benefits. Its sweet but not too sweet. It's got a combination of tomato and mustard and maybe some vinegar taste to it but I'm not sure about the vinegar.  It's just everything good about BBQ sauces rolled into one. And coming from me, you don't hear that kind of compliment very often.<br /><br />Even my wife likes it better than any other sauce4 I've brought home when coming back from trips down south. She eats it  on my famous home cooked pork tenderloins that  I cook quite often and that's saying a lot because she claims not to like garlic and I didn't let her in on the secret that garlic is one of the ingredients.  I only bought one bottle when I was down South and I'm sorry I let her try it because she finished off the bottle.<br /><br />I haven't tried the other sauce Mr. Larry makes but would like to give it a spin but for some reason  Amazon doesn't carry it.

First you get sweet, then a sour and spicey but fruity undernote followed by a nice but not too hot burn. Also the sauce has a great texture with pieces of onion complementing the flavor.<br />  Great sauce, if I had one complaint...why so many artificial ingredients, i.e hydrolized protien, etc..??

review/summary: Delicious and nutrient
review/text: This 2nd foods is delicious and nutrient. My Babe swallows it quickly and wants the next one at once. I think it is because all of my family like the taste of cheese.

review/summary: Good product, but bad from Amazon
review/text: I love Gerber organic products like this which combine veggies and/or fruits. I bought one of the "Farmers Market" from the regular grocery store to make sure my 8 month old liked it, which he did. I bought a case from Amazon, but the consistency was like soup, very runny unlike the one I bought from the store. Heating it up made it worse. Maybe it was a fluke, but the second case from Amazon ordered a few months later had the same problem.

review/summary: Son eats it
review/text: I like the portion size on this one.  Son started eating this at 5 1/2 months.  No issue with feeding him cold or hot he eats it.  I like the benefits of DHA and I like the listed Vegetables/Grains.<br /><br />I like the pricing, no tax, and free shipping to my door.  Can't beat the price for pack of 8 in the stores.  we get this food delivered too.<br /><br />The packs are easy to throw in diaper bag w/spoon and feed him.  Less mess and fuss.<br /><br />Our son's 11 months now and still eats this.

review/summary: a green veggie my son will eat!!
review/text: I love this gerber item!!  My son is 6 months old and is a bit particular.  He spits out most veggies, except sweet potatoes of course, and even a lot of fruits, unless I mix them with cereal to thicken them up a bit!  He loves the thick texture of this food!!!  So from a frustrated mommy, this is a great thing!!!  If your child is refusing green beans or sweet peas, give this a try!  Its got enough texture to please my babe, it may be your favorite too!!
