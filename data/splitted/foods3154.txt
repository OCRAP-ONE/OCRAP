review/summary: A huge bag of popcorn!
review/text: Ever since I got new popcorn maker, I have been trying out all sorts of new types of popcorn.  I am a fan of the small, ladyfinger types (pop small but big on flavor)<br /><br />First off, the box that this came in was very heavy, not expecting it to weigh that much.  They come in one big plastic bag, and my initial problem was that after opening, what to do with the remaining 12 pounds or so to store it.<br /><br />I did find a big pickle jar, and most of the bag is in there.  It is going to take me a good part of a year to go thru all of this.<br /><br />The pops are huge, and there is some flavor, better than other big pops popcorn.  But over all the flavor lacks as compared to the ladyfinger.<br /><br />This would be better for a movie theatre or somebody that makes a lot of popcorn on a daily basis, like in a car dealership waiting room.<br /><br />Not really good for the individual who loves popcorn.  Unless you really love popcorn.

review/summary: KEEPING THE WIFE HAPPY
review/text: I was not aware of Maryland Club tea until my wife said that she used to drink it all the time when she was a kid so I started looking at the grocery store for it.  I was unable to find it at the stores so I started looking online.  I wasn't sure which kind to get as this was to be a surprise and I didn't want to ask her. I got the Orange Pekoe tea and when it arrived she said that it wasn't what she used to drink but would see how it tasted.  This is my third time to order from you and she absolutely will not let me order any other kind.  She loves it and I have even started drinking iced tea.  It's good stuff.  Thanks for making it available to the public.<br />WLEE

review/summary: Good cheap tea
review/text: I stumbled upon this product in the strangest way(found a bag in a hospital tote), and it doesn't taste like orange at all, but this is a decent black tea - it actually sinks into the cup, making steeping a less frustrating experience than with other teas. It doesn't taste like orange at all, which is a tad misleading..but I don't really care for fruity teas anyway. I like to use 2 teabags for a medium cup, with a little cream, and this tea does the trick. For me, it tastes better than Lipton's bitter-tasting black tea for sure! Great value at around $5 per box, thanks Amazon!

review/text: I love Ultratex 8. It has so many wonderful uses other than the fruit papers everyone seems to use it for. It is fabulous for thickening any sauce/liquid that you don't want to heat. I've also made some super quick no-cook puddings/mousses with it that were just fantastic. It does take some trial and error to figure out how much to use in a particular dish or sauce. Not enough and it just does nothing. Too much and it turns into rubber cement.

review/summary: Nectar of the gods
review/text: I've been drinking one Guayaki Herba Mate Empowermint drink each day for the past 3 years.  It is sooo much better than coffee and much more refreshing.  I special order 2 cases a month at Whole Foods and look forward to each morning when I can pop the cap and take the first sip of the day.  Mmmm.<br /><br />This drink not only adds a little spring to my step, but it also makes me more "aware."  That's hard to scientifically measure, but the days I don't have this drink, I feel the neurons in my brain firing slower and not making the connections I usually come up with after a bottle of this.  The days I drink this nectar, I feel like I can conquer many tasks.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: My dog took to these dental sticks the moment I introduced one to him. His breath smells the same as the dental sticks themselves, which is better than how it used to smell. Also, this product gets sort of messy. It might have been because of the saliva that was on the dental stick as he chewed one, but it left marks on the couch (the marks were easy to clean but I'm going to make sure he chews them on the tile floor or the rug instead). Overall, my dog loves them so I will continue being a Get Naked customer.

That gives me roughly 7 months to eat 6 pounds of seeds.  I'd have given the product 5 stars if the expiration was closer to a year away.

review/text: I had never used these baking cups before, but due to the price I figured I would give them a try.  I was a little worried that they wouldn't fit my mini cupcake pan because of one of the other reviews, but they fit the pan fine.  I have to admit that I didn't think they would fit at first.  They do look a little on the big side.  When you put the liner in the pan, they do not sink to the bottom until you put your batter in.<br />I like that when you take the liners apart, they don't stick together.  I've had other liners stick together where you don't realize and you end up baking with two liners instead of one.  I would buy these again.  I just bought the large If You Care Baking Cups due to my experience with these.

I make many Muffins and Mini Muffins and they dont't stick to the Cups and the Cups are easy to peel off the Muffins big or small. The Baking Cups look pretty much the same before and after they are Baked, which is always good. If You Care Mini Baking Cups are one of the better ones to Bake with.<br /><br />The Baking Cups are unbleached and Grease Proof, I have been using them for a while and never had any problems with the Cups fitting in my Mini Muffin Baking Trays. The Cups are gluten free and allergen free and as I understand there's no Chlorine used in the production. I prefer to Bake with If You Care Mini Muffin Cups or White Cups than all those Colored Baking Cups with their strong dyes and inks that bleed into the Muffins. Thank You

Another reviewer mentioned that you have to add stuff to the cups for them to sink into place; mind don't even fit like that--they just drop right into place, as if I were using regular baking cups in a regular baking cup tin.  No problem at all.<br /><br />They worked perfectly for my peanut butter cups.  They held their form, and they didn't stick to the peanut butter cups; after they were done, the peanut butter cups just popped right out.<br /><br />We are going to have mini baking cups for a really long time here, but that's okay, because they're good ones.

review/summary: Will order again; a few "quirks"
review/text: My current box of these is a little loose in its folds so that I have to squeeze the sides of the cups to get them down into the mini muffin pan wells.  I had had this issue before on the full size cups but my most recent shipment of those does not have the problem, so perhaps it only affects some boxes of the mini cups as well.  In any case this is not a big deal to me but it does cause minor imperfections in the shape of the cupcakes - when the batter goes in sometimes a couple of folds squeeze together so they are not uniform all the way around the cupcake.<br /><br />The other quirk I've noticed, probably related to the above, is that the bottoms of my cupcakes have come out less than flat.  This means a few cupcakes have tilted over when I am frosting or serving them.  This problem is a little more annoying to me than the lack of uniformity around the sides of the cupcake.  It's possible I could avoid it by tamping down my batter a bit when filling the cups but I'm not sure as the cups seemed to be flat against the pan after filling them.<br /><br />Despite these issues, I like that these cups are green and that they release the cupcakes well when you peel off the paper.  I will order them again.

review/summary: Delicious Danish Dessert
review/text: I have used the Danish Dessert for years.  I always got it at our IGA, and they went out of business.  I finally searched the web and found it through Amazon.  I used the strawberry for pies.  I never knew they made the raspberry until I found it on the web. I just add the fruit and put it in a pie shell.  It makes the best pie glaze that I have ever tasted.  My husband loves it.  I always keep a large supply on hand.  I would recommend this product for everyone.

review/summary: Unique and aromatic
review/text: I first bought the tea from an English shop (British Isles) located in Rice Village in Houston, TX. I immediately fell in love with it due to its unique fruity flavor that goes very well with the black tea. It is strong enough to wake me up in the morning but mild enough to not leave a bitter after-taste in my mouth. I also tried the passion fruit and strawberry flavors from Ahmad but love the black currant one the most and the strawberry one the least (too sweet). I also gave it as a gift to friends and it was also well-received. I am glad that Amazon carries it. Buying the tea in bulk here is relatively cheaper than from the British shop. I am not sure if this tea tastes like fresh black currants but am sure it deserves a better rating than what's seen on this post.

review/text: I have never tried Ahmad tea although I had heard Ahmad's brand quality was high and I was looking for a better blackcurrant tea ever since Twining's changed their blackcurrant tea formula into something with yucky flowery herbs.  Well, I couldn't taste any herbs in Ahmad's blackcurrant tea.  In fact, I couldn't taste/smell any blackcurrant at all.  The tea leaves OVERPOWER whatever blackcurrant flavor is there.  If you're looking for a blackcurrant tea, Ahmad's would not be a good choice.

review/text: I don't have fresh blackcurrant fruit every day so I'm not sure if this tea gets the flavor exactly right but it sure is close to what I expected.  It's a refreshing change from the norm in black teas (plain, lemon, berry etc...).  A few reviewers found it plain tasting which might be due to the fact that the flavor becomes more familiar after a few sips (the flavor doesn't last long in your mouth as if you're chewing flavored gum), but most tea lovers should still find it a refreshing change.

review/summary: I have finally found THE blackcurrant tea!
review/text: A while back, I had bought Twinings Black Currant Tea - it was in simple yellow packaging, and the tea delivered on taste & aroma. Recently, I tried to buy it, but noticed that the packaging was not only different, but the name of the tea was different as well. I tried their herbal version, and was greatly disappointed that my water turned red and the taste was overwhelmingly fruity. I was already buying Ahmad Decaf Tea, and came across this. We LOVE the decaf tea, so I thought that I should give this black currant version a chance. I am SO grateful I did, as I have finally found the perfect replacement. My water looks like tea (I hate when my water turns a different color), and I taste & smell the black currant in just the right amount. This is a GREAT product!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: My wife is Russian and she grew up having tea as a main beverage. Later, she lived in London for several years. As such, she appreciates the finer varieties of teas and our kitchen pantry always has at least a half dozen different kinds of tea on the beverage shelf. Just the other day she picked up a 20-bag box of Ahmad Blackcurrent Tea at a little European delicatessen she favors. She's been raving about how excellent it is ever since and pressured me to try it. Well, it was good, but I'm really more of a coffee lover and it's as difficult for me to judge a fine tea as it is for her to recognize an outstanding coffee. Believe me, however, her taste in teas is refined and if she says it's excellent I would fully trust her judgment. The price, by the way, as listed here is a bargain.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I have broken a 25 year diet soda habit, so the quality of the tea was important to me.  I brewed my first batch and I am pleased and relieved that it tastes just like the last batch made with the Twinings Blackcurrant. It is packaged individually in foil packets that I believe will give it a long shelf life.  Cheers.

review/text: This formula is for premature infants for weight gain. Do not buy it for term babies unless directed to do so by your baby's doctor. It is expensive, but my little guy has grown well on it. The NICU gave us Similac, but that made him very gassy. He gets two bottles of this formula daily. His other bottles are breastmilk or regular formula. Do not use it for all feedings as it is highly concentrated and can actually cause your baby to become dehydrated.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: This formula has helped us immensely!  My 7-week old infant has had trouble gaining weight (she was born 4 weeks early) and after trying breast milk, fortified breast milk, and formula, we finally tried Enfacare.  And she gained weight! She seems to like it and I'm so happy that she is putting on weight.  She still has some gas, spit up, and the occasional throw-up, but what baby doesn't?  I would highly recommend this product, especially for a premature baby or a baby who isn't gaining weight well.

review/summary: Great Formula/Product - Amazon Packaging/Shipping an Issue
review/text: This formula is great for preemie babies.  There are no problems whatsoever with the product.  We purchased this product several times from Amazon; however have had problems with the packaging.  There have been several damaged containers, which of course you can no longer use because of potential contamination.  They were great in providing a refund for the first problem, they also did attempt to change the packaging by sending it in a box with bubble wrap the next time... but the problem persists.  I will not be ordering it from them again unless the packaging is fixed for good.

It sure seems to be working - they've gone from 5th percentile to 35th percentile for full-term singleton babies (which they were not :)

review/text: Having a preemie this is the one formula our doctor recommends. Because she is a preemie, it's recommended that she be on this formula until 52 weeks corrected.  AKA. 1 year.  This is the best price I have found and even though it's not much cheaper then at Wally world or Target, the fact that I don't have to cart all 3 of my kids (all under 5) into the store is worth it.  Having Prime, it's great.  I get down to my last 2 cans and order another 6 online and it's at my house in 2-3 days! What could a mother ask for! Not much more.  Thanks Amazon Prime!

review/summary: Some help, some not
review/text: I had a problem with my radishes being eaten by Peter Cottontail.  I caught him 2-3 mornings in a row.  I put this out and he's still eating my radishes.  I used more.  I have maybe 6 radishes left.  (I had tried to get a row to go to seed because I wanted the seeds more than the radishes.)  So it was no help at all with Mr. Cottontail.  I've got a trap now, and it hasn't worked either.  Maybe he is just a smart rabbit.<br /><br />BUT my cucumbers are directly behind my radishes, and I let my chickens out once a day and usually they try to go over and nibble my vines and we have to redirect them.  They have not been at all interested in my cucumbers since I put out the Critter Ridder.  It seems to work on chickens.<br /><br />I have a feral cat that gets over there a lot.  I think he's stalking the rabbit.  It has not deterred him.<br />I haven't had trouble with deer there.<br /><br />SO, I think it might or might not work, depending on your critter.  Deer netting is something I've used in the past, and it seems cheaper and more effective.  I ended up potting some of the radishes and moving them into the greenhouse so I could make sure to get my seeds.

review/text: I will update this review in time if a different conclusion is reached, however, after about a month of time and two applications we still have chipmunks burrowing under our step and patio.  I will say that it seems the chipmunks frequent our patio and back step LESS now than they did a month ago, but they are not gone.  I think this product would be more effective if all of my neighbors used this product too.  I live in a suburban area and our yards are small and our houses are close together.  I know that all my neighbors have chipmunk problems too, so maybe if we all used this product, then I would find this to be more successful.

review/summary: So far, so good
review/text: We have two types of nuisance pests - bunnies and voles. The bunnies eat up our garden and the voles eat up our lawn. I've tried all kinds of repellent, from commercial granules such as this to home-made recipes containing urine & castor oil. Although they may repeal for a time, our pests always return.<br /><br />This critter ridder was easy to apply, although I wish the shake canister top had a more finely calibrated way to shake out the ingredients. The ingredients appear to be relatively natural, and the dominant smell is of pepper - which didn't bother us while we applied or spent time in the yard application.<br /><br />It's been 2 weeks, and so far, so good. There has been no sign of bunnies, and there are no new vole trails. The product is expected to last 30 days, so that gives us just over 2 more weeks of protection and cover. Time will tell, but I would use this product again.

review/text: I've had problems with coyotes, wild hares, skunks, opossums, gophers, mice, and neighbors' cats messing up my front/backyard lawns and gardens. I spread this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016PC4TS">Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular Shaker</a> around areas where I've seen those critters frequent and caused damage. After about two weeks, I haven't seen any new damage caused by those annoying critters/intruders.  The granules are easy to dispense; similar to a giant pepper shaker. The granules' aroma is not too offensive; smells like strong black pepper and doesn't bother our family or guests.  The only drawback is the rather high cost of $27.50/5 lbs.; I've already used about half the container to apply one application to my front and backyards. The claims of rain-resistance and 30 days effectiveness remains to be seen.

review/summary: Works for Raccoons, Squirrels and Chipmunks.
review/text: I was interested in this product to help deal with an abundance of chipmunks on my property  as well as stopping raccoons and squirrels from getting into my garbage cans. It has worked in both cases.<br /><br />Chipmunks: For some reason chipmunks have been in great abundance in my neighborhood. I live in New Jersey so my guess is the mild winter had something to do about it.  A few chipmunks are nice, more than a few eat flowers and vegetables and make a mess.<br /><br />I saw two holes in the ground that the chipmunks  were using as burrows.  I poured the Critter Ridder in and around the burrow holes and it seemed like activity around the burrow holes stopped. I still see some chipmunks but not as many as before.<br /><br />Raccoons and Squirrels:  I have half-a-dozen plastic garbage cans whose covers have holes in them due to hungry squirrels wanting to get at the food in them.  I also have awakened on many days to find my garbage cans knocked over but what I am pretty certain were raccoons foraging for food.<br /><br />Certain foods tend to be more appetizing than others. For some reason chicken and fish and certain fruits like apples and pears tend to attract the squirrels and raccoons more than others but any food is a target to them.<br /><br />I have been pouring Critter Ridder around my garbage cans and it seems to be keeping all animals away.  I threw chicken bones out one night and was expecting some animal to try to knock over my garbage can or get into it and nothing happened. I have been using this for three weeks and it has worked.<br /><br />I like the idea that this product is natural and will not poison or kill anything.  The smell alone is enough to make me take notice and I got some on my hand  which burned a little but I felt fine after washing my hands. The bottle has a handle and an easy pour cover which works great and except for the one occasion I have not gotten any more on me.<br /><br />Every week or so I pour out some more Critter Ridder around the burrows and garbage cans. So far this is keeping the critters away.

I am finally getting to harvest my tomatoes and it looks like my bean plants are starting to grow again.  I like that this is not so horribly scented as some of the other products on the market.  This has a very strong black pepper smell instead of a rotting garlic smell. It seems to work as well as many of the other products out there. It has a convenient shaker lid. This is definitely a product worth getting.

review/summary: Shows promise, but overall conclusion is hard to judge
review/text: I will update this review as I don't think any firm conclusion has been reached.<br /><br />We have an outdoor birdfeeder that has been victimized by racoons and a squirrel (I know it's the same one, because he has a crooked tail and is not bothered by humans!).<br /><br />I spread the Critter Ridder out, and have not seen the squirrel since.<br /><br />I can't believe one spreading would annoy a determined squirrel, but the evidence remains that I haven't seem him - so who knows!<br /><br />It's rained since I treated the area a couple weeks back, and a raccoon came back and tried and failed to pull the feeder down - but I'm sure the repellent has been diluted in the interim.<br /><br />I am going to spread the Ridder around again, and leave the feeder out - so we'll see if the raccoon comes back. He has to work pretty hard to dislodge the feeder, so maybe the Ridder will make it not worth his while.<br /><br />So for now, I like the product. I haven't seen the squirrel, so I can only go by the evidence. But...I'm not a total believer yet, either. I'll update and change this review as more evidence comes in!<br /><br />UPDATE 8/24: I still haven't seen that squirrel again. I sprinkled some more down, but I'd still be very surprised if this was the complete solution. I do have a pair of chipmunks that run around the deck area, and I have seen them before and since I've sprinkled the Ridder - but they don't mess with the bird feeder anyway.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/5: Bird seed is declining rapidly, and while I haven't seen the squirrel (and there are a lot of birds), I suspect him! So I'm spreading it again, and we'll see what happens.

review/summary: Nice features, questionable efficacy
review/text: This product has a number of appealing features.  Most importantly,it is not toxic, created from pepper compounds.  It is reputed to last up to thirty days.  It is easy to apply and the shaker container is managable.  Additionally, it can be applied indoors or out.  According to the package,it is designed to  repel racoons, chipmunks, squirrels,skunks, and groundhogs as well as cats and dogs.<br /><br />I thought this would be an ideal way to deter my neighbor's dogs from charging on to our property.  Even though the road is lethal and the woods are full of hungry predators, think bobcats, coyotes and bears, the neighbors let their pets run loose.  So far they've lost two dogs to traffic and three cats to predators.  Although the dogs seem like nice little fellows, I have a territorial German Shepherd who takes umbrage at their daily excursions. I don't appreciate them using my lawn and garden to eliminate. So it was with high hopes that I sprinkled this about.  Unfortunately it did not deter them for more than a day. Ironically, I now see that the dog crossing has now become a chipmunk transit route.  So while I like some things about this product, overall, it didn't work for me.

review/summary: Worked for about 24 hours
review/text: To test this product, i sprinkled a layer onto an area of my yard that one of my cats has taken to using as his private litter box. It's bare dirt, dry, sheltered from the wind.<br /><br />I used about half of the package, which claims to cover 300 square feet, on this area that's approximately 75 square feet. I didn't intend to overdose it so badly, but it's very hard to estimate how much you're shaking out over what square footage. (In case you don't feel like doing the math, that means i used about twice as much per square foot as the packaging says is necessary.)<br /><br />Day 1: The cat went to his new favorite toilet, sniffed around, and meandered off. I didn't see him set foot in that space all day.<br /><br />Day 2: The cat went to his new favorite toilet, dug a hole, and did his business.<br /><br />So even at double strength, this product deterred a housecat for all of approximately one day. One windless, rainless day. That hardly seems like something worth spending money on.<br /><br />And speaking of money, you're paying for something that is, by weight, less than 1% active ingredients. That means about 0.8 ounces of this product is important, and the rest is filler. And those active ingredients are basically black pepper and a little bit of something like cayenne pepper. You can buy a 2-3 ounce container of black pepper at any grocery store for a few dollars, so why pay more than $20 for this? Even if it worked, it would be a waste of money.

I think you have to stay on top of applciations because the damp soil/earth will probbaly reduce the potency.<br /><br />So far so good and it seems to be doing its job.

review/text: Although the product says its formula is proprietary, it leans heavily on red and black pepper. I have used these same ingredients to keep cats (off the porch) and squirrels (off the birdhouses) away. I have discovered that, like this, it is sometimes effective. Most animals do not like pepper and will learn to stay away. However, there are some--not many--who do not have the aversion.<br /><br />The one thing I particularly like about this product is that the granular shaker bottle makes it easy to spread the product as well as store it. It's much cheaper to buy red and black pepper, but this is definitely a more convenient solution.

review/summary: Works on both friends and foes
review/text: I have been dealing with pests in my summer garden.  Mostly squirrels but also rabbits and possums.  I am using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BO71NY">Havahart's Motion Detector Sprinkler</a> to help keep them out and it really seems to work.  However, I believe in a multi-prong defense strategy.  Havaharts Critter Ridder adds an additional layer of protection for my precious veggies.  When a wild creature gets used to the spray this repellent seems to keep them from hanging out in my little garden.<br /><br />However, not every plant-raider is a wild foe.  My 5 month old Miniature Blue Heeler likes to dig up some of the bushes that I planted this season.  She saw me plant them and I think that she believes that she is helping me (a Heeler trait.)  I used this product to keep her away from the bushes that she loves to excavate.<br /><br />At first the odor kept her away but the urge to dig won out.  However, when she starting claw at the ground the hot pepper irritated her just enough to make her stop and she hasn't gone back since.  I like this stuff and it seems to work for several weeks for the squirrels and longer for my puppy.  I also like that it does not contain some of the nasty stuff that other products have.

review/text: I've tried everything I can think of for our raccoon problem - powdered mountain lion urine and various sprays, and nothing has worked for more than a day.  Unfortunately, the Havahart Critter Ridder joins the long list of things that have tried and failed to keep them from trying to get into the kitchen or tear apart the deck.<br />The Critter Ridder is made from various peppers and capsaicin oil.  It does not smell very good, and you have to use gloves to apply it to make sure it does not get on your skin or in your eyes.  The raccoons seemed stymied by this for two days... and then they were back.  I reapplied the powder, and it still didn't seem to matter - they were rattling the cupboards at 3 am like always.  So, in my experience, failure for raccoons.<br />I gave this product three stars because it did seem to work in the garden to keep the deer from eating the flowers.  I apply this once per week and so far so good with the deer.<br />Other reviewers have also mentioned the cost factor, and I agree - if you have to apply this weekly or even more frequently as a deterrent, it is going to get pricey quickly.  I do not think it worked any better or worse than the lion urine or Keep-Away, which due to the quantity you need to apply was actually more cost effective.<br />If you want to keep deer away, I think this would be a good choice.  For raccoons, I just can't recommend it.

review/summary: So Far So Good
review/text: We've been having a couple raccoons stopping by each night and foraging around the plants and trash, so we've been looking for a deterrent to keep them from getting too  comfortable and deciding to hang out.  We didn't want to trap or hurt them, or use anything with chemicals that would be bad for the plants and animals, so this Critter Ridder seemed like a good choice since it's apparently all natural and unharmful.  Apparently, it just stinks really bad to animals yet isn't bothersome to us humans.  But I  think we went a bit haywire with it because it's a 5lb canister and we used a bit over half of it for a relatively small area.  Supposedly, the canister is good for multiple applications to a mid sized area, but I doubt that, given how much we used for just 1 application.  But it seems to be doing the trick, because our security cams caught the raccoons steering clear from where we sprinkled the Critter Ridder.  The only downside I see, is this stuff is it's quite expensive for something that needs to be reapplied every 30 days, or sooner, if you water the area often or it rains.  If you had to keep this up regularly, it would cost quite a bit over the course of a summer, especially if you're trying to cover a larger area.  I'm just hoping the raccoons learn to stay away and forage elsewhere before we run out and need to buy more of this expensive stuff.  Fingers crossed.<br /><br />Bottom Line - works well enough but costs too much to be practical.

review/summary: Worked Wonderfully for less than 1 hour
review/text: We have a schnauzer/poodle mix (schnoodle) who loves to dig in the bed of mulch in front of our house where I planted rose bushes this year. I only had to do a light sprinkle of Havahart Critter Ridder along the perimeter (in the mulch, but far enough away from the actual bushes)...<br /><br />We were thrilled that it actually worked! He took a couple of sniffs and then turned away. For almost an hour he sat outside with his back to it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my daughter was so impressed that she began "testing him" by calling him over to her as she stood behind the flower bed. Yes, he ran across it in order to go to her, but he did not linger.<br /><br />I did have doubts that this would work well out here if it weren't for it being the dry summertime...Usually, it rains at some point almost every day. One would constantly be reapplying the granules-that would get old and expensive.<br /><br />We only needed this for a short-term solution, and were very satisfied with the results FOR ONE HOUR.<br /><br />I just walked outside to find that the culprit had red mulch in his mouth and stuck in his fur from digging in the bed of roses-UGH!

review/summary: A Colossal Failure for Me: Raccoons in My Trash
review/text: I was excited to try this, as I've had raccoons knocking over my garbage and recycling cans for weeks this summer. I followed the directions and applied lots of this all around the area where my garbage is, even sprinkling a little in the garbage for good measure. I closed the lids tight. That same night, it was worse than ever-- garbage knocked over, trash all over the side of my house. By the time I saw it, there were flies swarming and birds picking through it... meaning that I guess flies and birds don't mind this repellent either!<br /><br />It would be one star except that I do like the idea that it's safe and approved for organic gardens-- but it's clearly not effective in all cases.<br /><br />It leaves a peppery smell in the area, and you're advised to wear gloves while applying it.

review/summary: Possums
review/text: I have possums and raccoons getting in my trash all the time.  Raccoons make a big mess, possums make a littler mess.  Anyway, I put this stuff in an area around the trash cans and since then no critters have been in the trash.  That could be a fluke--I don't know.  But since critters are always in my trash and now they are not, I figure this stuff just might be working.  I'll know more as I use it more.

review/summary: Keeps the Possums and Raccoons away from my house
review/text: I'm in the Suburbs of Chicago, and our area has a lot of Possums and Raccoons - some of those Raccoons look like giant mutant Ferrets. I'm remodeling the house, and am away a week at a time. I've occasionally found animal droppings around the foundation and under the deck. In the past I've tried the commercial bottles of animal urine (really stinks, easy to spill, requires a lot!) So I liked the idea of 1) pellets, 2) ease of application, 3) Does not stink.<br /><br />After spreading these around the perimeter with the handy-dandy container design, and adding some to the fence where I thought the critters were entering (climbing over and digging under) I left for a week. No new signs of these foul critters. In other words, the little used side of my house (you know, where the A/C sits along with little used hoses and the like) was poop free.<br /><br />The stuff looks slightly oily (I assume from the black pepper oil) and smells like a day-old Cajun dinner. Lots of spice, a little stale. The active ingredients are Capsaicin (as in pepper spray and really hot spices), black pepper oil and piperine (piperine is responsible for pungency of black pepper.)<br /><br />So when animals, with their super-sensitive noses, smell this stuff, it chases them away. Like pepper-spray does, only this is passive.<br /><br />There's also a decent amount, so I can apply several times (after heavy rain, a few weeks, etc.)

review/summary: Seems to even work on ants!
review/text: I have had a horrible time with rabbits eating my plants so, even though rabbits weren't listed as an animal this repels, I figured I'd give it a try.  First, I watered everything and noticed as I watered that the ants had nested in my garden again.  I have a horrible time with ants and, believe me, in the past, watering hasn't gotten rid of them at all.  I put down the Havahart Critter Ridder pretty thick and left everything.  I came back two days later to water again and noticed the ants were GONE.  I'm talking, not a single one.  The only thing I did different was the Critter Ridder so, for now, I'm going to give the credit there!  It also appears to have stopped the rabbits because nothing was eaten down more than two days prior.<br /><br />On a side note, I didn't read the container until after I sprinkled it all around my raspberry bushes.  It is not to be used with food crops.  Oops!  Good thing we're in our first year of raspberry bushes and they aren't producing yet.

review/summary: So far so good...
review/text: It's generally hard to prove a negative so I am going to have to pledge to come back and revise my review if things change in the future, but so far so good. We have a very bad problem of chipmunks (and possibly other types of animals) digging tunnels in our yard and under our house so we were very hopeful that this would work. After sprinkling it everywhere we saw a hole and near all the access points to the under the house areas we are not seeing any more animals, but then again we only saw them every few weeks or so before. This weekend we are going to fill the holes with fill dirt and then after that we will see if this product is really working based on whether or not we see new holes, especially near the house. anyway, like I said so far so good but this will need more time for monitoring. If I find later on that this product is not helping I will revise this review so if you are reading this now everything is still OK.
