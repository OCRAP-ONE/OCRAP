review/summary: GLUTEN FREE: Lower calories, but has enough sweetness to tackle that little afternoon craving
review/text: Lets not get too crazy here: looking for a snack that holds only organic products and is GLUTEN FREE and has little manufactured ingredients: yep, big thunms up for this one; looking for lower sugar content: yep, if you compare it with the other KIND bars; and has enough sweetness to sustain that sweet tooth: very big smile.<br />However, the sugar content is still there and moderation comes from the slightly higher pricing compared with other snack bars.  The texture of this bar is chewy and can be quite filling.  So great for on the road, as part of a calorie count!  I sometimes forget about the latter and I think I am eating better and hence think I can eat more!  So I am crazy over this new snack bar, but restrained myself when I think that it does add up if I dont exercise/move around as much  as I should do: such a dampner!<br /><br />I love it as it does not contain any gluten agents!

review/summary: Great taste ... too sweet
review/text: This is a great tasting bar, with an unusually different combination of dates and walnuts. I find it to be a substitute for a candy bar or sweet bite. However, in my opinion, it's far too sweet. My bars have crystallized sugar in them. Don't know if that's intentional or not. Perhaps the bars are old? However, I find it to be a "it hurts my teeth" kind of sweet ... yes, for sensitive areas on my teeth, it's far too sugary. In addition, I highly doubt the caloric content ... 150 calories for 1.4 ounce bar with Dates, Walnuts, Honey, & Glucose as the first 4 ingredients. Given the sugar, ingredients & density, caloric content of comparable bars are in the 250-range. I am a lifetime Weight Watcher and extraordinarily conscientious about these things. The listed caloric content is too low for the ingredients and sugar.<br /><br />I won't be getting these bars again.

review/summary: Very good, but not quite as good as their other bars
review/text: I became hooked on Kind's plus mango macadamia bars a while ago. I've also grown to love their plus cranberry almond bars. I ordered these based on the rave reviews, but I was just a little disappointed. They are still good, but lack a little luster in the flavor department. I found them slightly bland, and I am a huge date fan, and like walnuts just as much. So I'm not sure why these seemed bland to me, maybe there just isn't enough date in them ... maybe they need to add a little extra honey or brown sugar to tweak the sweetness a little bit, or maybe some sea salt? Also I could not really taste the walnuts much either, I've been spoiled by their other bars (the macadamia and almond) where the nuts are completely whole. Perhaps I just received an 'off' batch. Overall, a still very good fruit/nut bar, but the flavor could be enhanced. I don't think I will order these again, when their other bars are so awesome, which surprises me, because I really love dates! On the plus side, for those who prefer a softer style bar, this one's pretty easy on the teeth, easier than the ones with whole almonds.

review/summary: Jacl Daniels 86 Poof GREAT BBQ Sauce
review/text: I went way out of my way to acquire two bottles of Lynchburg Tennessee Jack Daniels 86 Poof BBQ sauce. I used to pass through Nashville, Tennessee frequently and always picked up a bottle or two to bring home to Arizona. I don't get to Tennessee much anymore, so the last time I passed through Nashville, Tennessee airport, I stopped at a shop and bought two bottles. Mind you, I was on a dead-run to get to an already-boarding flight that I had to hustle to catch. But, I had to get my 86 Poof! When I got home, my dear beloved wife gave away both bottles to friends who had helped out housesitting while we were away.....Sooooo, I ordered more bottles online at Amazon. Now all is well, and I am enjoying by 86 Poof once again. - -

review/summary: Black Cherry Concentrate Benefits
review/text: Tree of Life -- Black Cherry Concentrate is a great product for joint health. I drink it regularly mixed with water and no sweetener of any kind. It reduces the stiffness and pain common to arthritis and has replaced my reliance on anti-inflammatory drugs. (I no longer use them because of the side effects and because they are hard on kidneys.) I also use fresh berries and tumeric, but a concentrate is handy to have when fresh berries are unavailable. I buy mine in bulk from Amazon.com. I heartily recommend this product to you if you need joint relief and want to take something natural and healthy.

review/summary: Favorite Hot Sauce x4!
review/text: What's better than a bottle of Tabanero? Four bottles! Believe me, I use this stuff faster than I ever would have imagined and a single bottle only lasts 1 to 2 weeks. How do I put this nicely? Hrm, ...Tabanero makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZSYS">TABASCO</a> taste like spicy vinegar-water in comparison. I personally don't mind a bit of vinegar in my hot sauces, but Tabanero has opened my eyes to how good a hot sauce actually can be.<br /><br />Tabanero is really more of a food than a condiment. The ingredients include habanero peppers, carrots, onions, Key Lime juice, agave nectar and garlic; and they taste fresh and delicious. The agave nectar doesn't make Tabanero Picante sauce too sweet and it compliments the fire of the habanero peppers nicely. In fact, in a very short time Tabanero has become the staple hot sauce in my home. It has enough kick to make my taste buds stand up and take notice, but is mild enough to be used in a variety of dishes. It goes great with the usual suspects--from nachos to most Mexican dishes--yet is so versatile that I enjoy it with omelets and stuffed peppers too. Added to soup, it gives it a certain extra "something". You may think me odd, but I like a swig right out of the bottle when in need of a quick pick-me-up.<br /><br />Tabanero's hit gold with what I consider the perfect blend of ingredients in a tasty, versatile picante sauce that packs just the right amount of heat. The all natural ingredients are a plus, just be sure to vigorously shake your bottle before serving for maximum flavor. You can get the single bottle but if you like this stuff as much as I do, then it makes good (economic) sense to buy the 4-pack.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: Fresh taste and flavorful
review/text: I am so used to Tabasco that it is now tastes boring to me. I tried many kinds though; some are disappointingly watered down, while some are so fire hot but taste like synthetic or chemicals on the tongue. I also have the inexpensive favorite Sriracha; the problem with that is it does clogs sometimes at the tip. This is closer to the consistency of Frank's RedHot, but a bit spicier.<br /><br />I like the kick and fresh flavor of this hot sauce. Maybe the absence of vinegar really makes a difference. The color is more like orange, which is similar to duck sauce. It goes well with pizza, lo mein, soups, and most meat.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This is a complimentary item sent to me for review.

review/summary: A delicious hot sauce with some flavor
review/text: I love that this Tabanero hot sauce actually has some flavor to it, and isn't just adding heat to a dish with a mix of peppers and vinegar. The sauces blend of habanero peppers carrots and lime juice (with a few other natural ingredients) give your dishes a hot kick with a zesty tang of citrus. Two of my favorite things about this sauce are actually the two things that are not added to it, artificial coloring and vinegar. I'm allergic to artificial colors and vinegar can often cause me to have an upset stomach. So now I can finally have the heat with out the other issues. You can taste the freshness of the natural ingredients and the lime juice adds a brightness to the hot flavor. Absolutely delicious and very highly recommended. A sample was provided by the manufacturer for review.

review/summary: Great Flavor and Heat - Highly Recommended
review/text: This Tabanero "Hot Sauce Picante" has a wonderful natural flavor and a good amount of "heat". My family loves hot sauces, but our tolerance range from medium (my wife and son) to fairly hot (me and my daughter), and this is right on upper limit of medium.<br /><br />Some hot sauces are hot just for the sake of being hot, but this is also very flavorful and can be used to enhance salsas, dips, or other foods that could use some zing. I like that the ingredients are all natural, including Habanero peppers, carrots, onions, Key Lime juice, agave, garlic salt, and grapefruit seed extract. Note that this does not contain vinegar like most other hot sauces, and it doesn't miss it all. This has a great fresh pepper flavor that is slightly sweet tasting with a hint of carrot flavor coming through. The sauce has a nice consistency that makes it easy to see how much has been added to your food.<br /><br />It is important to shake the bottle well before serving since this has a tendency to separate, with the hot pepper component rising to the top. I didn't shake it before testing it on my finger tip and found it to quite potent, providing some amusement for my son.<br /><br />This is a very different and enjoyable hot sauce that provides both heat and flavor!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Pleasantly hot and fresh-tasting hot sauce
review/text: The initial taste of Tabanero Hot Sauce Piquante is the unique chili habanero flavor and then a fresh, bright taste from the key lime juice with a gentle undertone of sweetness from the carrots and agave and perhaps a slight saltiness.  The chilies quickly begin producing a pleasant heat that develops for a minute or two and then lingers in the mouth for about ten more minutes.<br /><br />I have other hot sauces made with habaneros, carrots, and lime juice but they also contain vinegar, which muddies up the clean citric acid sourness with acetic acid.  Tabanero tastes fresher and has a pleasant pulpy texture.<br /><br />Archaeological evidence shows that domesticated chili habanero fruit have been part of Mexican cuisine for more than 8,000 years.  This hot sauce is actually made down in Tabasco, where the tropical climate is well-suited for growing chilies.<br /><br />Habaneros rate 100,000 to 350,000 on the Scoville scale, among the hottest of peppers commonly found in the grocery store, with much more heat than the peppers commonly used for standard hot sauce.  Tabanero is hot enough that it needs to be kept away from the eyes and out of the reach of toddlers who may be attracted by the beautiful orange color.<br /><br />Ingredients:  select habanero peppers, carrots, onions, key lime juice, agave, garlic, salt and grapefruit seed extract.<br /><br />A sample of this product was provided for unbiased review.

review/text: I purchased Tabanero sauce for my brother who lives in Alaska. How many bottles of hot sauce does he and my sister in law have in their kitchen?  50? So I'm pretty sure he's a connoisseur of hot sauce. Anyway he describes Tabanero as not overly hot but very flavorful. After receiving his 4 pack my brother reports he is pouring tabanero sauce all over everything headed for the pie-hole. I wonder how it tastes on cornflakes? I want to also mention that the Tabanero company has great, and friendly, customer service. I definitely need to order some Tabanero for myself.

review/summary: Superior ingredients + careful balancing = WOW!
review/text: When I first tasted this sauce, I figured the odds were good that I'd like it.  Heck, I'd probably like habenero-flavored shoe leather.<br /><br />What I didn't expect was that I'd like Tabanero this much more than other hab sauces I've known.  For starters, the heat is moderated, allowing the fruitiness of the habanero pepper variety to really shine through.  "Moderated" is, of course, relative - for those who find most of the major-brand ubiquitous bottled sauces unbearably hot to start with, be warned that Tabanero has a bit *more* kick.  For those who sip from skull-and-crossbones labeled bottles that contain little more than distilled capsaicin...well, I don't even get that whole preference:  all pain and no flavor.<br /><br />Tabanero is all flavor, from the peppers being the first and dominant ingredient of the sauce (vs. water in too many brands) to the avoidance of food coloring and cheap thickeners (again pretty common elsewhere.)  Carrot juice instead both thickens the sauce and deepens its bright orange hue, and the acidic kick provided by aggressive use of vinegar in many other brands is here replaced with more mellow onion and key lime juice.<br /><br />Agave as a sweetener seems appropriate considering the geographic origin of this product (which is the Mexican state of Tabasco) - it's a light sweetener that I myself find more inoffensive than tasty, but probably a good choice for that very reason.  This sauce doesn't need to guild the lily with cloying and potentially flavor-masking sugar.<br /><br />My husband, trying this sauce for the first time, muttered something about it "not being spicy enough" and then proceeded to douse his dinner with the stuff, abandoning his usual <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000GHNTA">El Yucateco Red Chile Habanero Sauce, 4 oz.</a>, which was also on the table.  And just for fun, I'd left our family's favorite (non-Mexican) hot sauce - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZZM">Huy Fong, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, 28-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>.  That, too, remained untouched.<br /><br />Of course the thing about the Sriracha - its pepper base is red jalapenos, which makes for a *very* different, if equally addictive flavor profile.  But I can grab a 28 ounce bottle of Sricha from my local Asian Grocer for less than I'll pay for the 8 oz bottle of this liquid hab sunshine.  As with many folks, it's the age-old struggle between "what I love" and "what I can afford for everyday".<br /><br />Still, Habanero-specific sauces don't run cheap, and I can't imagine preferring one of those better-known brands, now that I've tried Tabanero.  Currently it's distributed in Southern California stores (and a smattering of southeast locales, mostly restaurants.) I'd love to see this sauce gain national prominence, because it would seriously raise the bar for everybody else.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I did receive a complimentary sample of this product from the manufacturer.  But if I felt so-so about it, I'd give a so-so review.

review/summary: decent, but not as "dental" as I expected
review/text: I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. Also the only breath freshening ingredients- rosemary and chlorophyll, are at the very tail end of the ingredient list as dead last and third to last. I am glad that these ingredients are present, but they are in such small quantities, that they can't be helping much. From personal experience, I have not noticed and breath freshening results. I think the only reason why they are "dental" treats is because of the small amount of rosemary and chlorophyll as well as the fact that they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. If your looking for a real dental treat I would recommend Crunch n' Clean with DentaShield. However, this is still a MUCH better treat than Pounce brand or Meow Mix or any soft treat that can have soft sticky particles that will stay stuck to your cats teeth and smell bad and cause dental problems. This treat may not help teeth significantly, but they definitely won't hurt them and probably do some good; just not as much as I expected for the price. Also there are tuns of vitamin in these, which is pretty cool. They really are pretty decent treats, and I would probably give them 4 stars if they were just treats. However, to be marketing them as "dental," they really should have enzymes or more prevalent dental ingredient.

review/summary: Greenies Rock
review/text: We've been using Greenies pretty much since Sadie was a kitty (she's about 3 now).  She recognizes the word "Greenies" and no matter how quietly I open the bag she can hear it from anywhere in the house - even when she's sleeping (a handy trick when I need to locate her).  We switched to canned food about a year ago so the liberal use of dental treats has become a necessity.*<br /><br />*I urge all my fellow cat lovers to read up on the health problems associated with dry cat food.  I can't pitch another web site here but urge folks to go online and look up info on switching from dry to canned.  Cats really do live longer on wet food diets.

review/summary: Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. It is rather weak, but a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little weak and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful for me, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker or less annoying.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Flavored Commercial Tea
review/text: ***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry--Lovely!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, and that's great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

Stash Earl Grey started me into experiencing tea beyond iced and typical restaurant fare. Today I have 20 varieties of teas, both in bags and loose and Stash Earl Grey is still one of my favorites to this day. (The flavor for Stash Earl Grey loose tea is different from the bagged. The bagged is better IMO.)<br /><br />Some other flavors and brands you might like if you like Stash Earl Grey.<br /><br />Stash Vanilla Nut Decaf. A perfect desert or night time tea.

It's perfect as an after-lunch pick-me-up and as simple as boiling water, just the right amount of caffeine.  The teabags are foil-sealed, so they stay fresh a long time.  I buy in quantity to save money.  Can't go wrong with this choice.

review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

They are also great for her to snack on while my family eats dinner, so she can sit with up and feel included, while having something she can independently feed herself without a huge mess.  They can get a little sticky, but not nearly as much as traditional teething biscuits. I would recommend this product to any momma, daddy, or family member.

Since this product is not always carried in the supermarkets in our area, it made sense to order some from Amazon and have a supply on hand.  The price seems comparable to what I have paid in the supermarket.

review/summary: No Sugar - No Difference
review/text: My favorite chocolate milk powder since i was a kid, this non-sugar version tastes just as good as when it has sugar. Definitely a good way to save your teeth, especially when you can drink a whole gallon of milk and maybe more on a hot day with Nesquik at your side.<br /><br />i remember buying the bunny shaped bins of this years ago, i wish they still had them(at least they don't here not sure of other areas). The bins(even if they are not bunny shaped) are recycle friendly you can give one or two of them to your kids to put their crayons or ''Treasures'' in, and you can blue bin them which is another plus.

review/summary: Tastes better with less sugar and fewer calories
review/text: I decided to buy the "no sugar added" version of this product because I just noticed that my local grocery store offered it. I expected this version of the product to not taste very good or to have a weird aftertaste. On the contrary, chocolate milk made with "no sugar added" Nesquik tastes better than the regular version. It has more chocolate flavor than the regular product and my daughter says that this version is "more powerful". This is likely why my daughter uses less of the product in her milk. (We make chocolate milk about 2x month, which makes it just an occasional drink for us, so she always used more than the "recommended serving" in her glass of milk. Haven't we all?)<br /><br />Perhaps the product has been reformulated since the previous reviews were made that mentioned the chalkiness of the product or the extra effort to dissolve it, but I have not encountered either. If anyone remembers the PDQ product from the 1970s, the Nesquik "no sugar added" version has a similar appearance because the product forms balls and chips instead of the perfectly sandy/dusty appearance of regular Nesquik. Nevertheless, I found the "no sugar added" version dissolved just as easily as regular version and it doesn't seem chalky at all. Given that this version costs less, has less sugar and fewer calories and is "more powerful", I will not buy the regular version again. Why would I? I hope no one at Nestle just read that.

review/summary: It is toooo sweet!
review/text: The reason I purchased this product is for the "No Sugar Added" clause. I am annoyed with all the sugar that is added in almost everything. Every kids cocoa drink has too much sugar added. After I tasted my first drink, it felt  too sweet and had an after taste. The taste of an artificial sweetener. After checking the ingredients, I noticed it contains "Sucralose". According to Wikipedia, Sucralose is 600 sweeter than table sugar! What's the point of buying something that has no sugar added but adding something that's tons of times sweeter? I am not going after the calorie factor. So does Nesquick add 600 times less amount of Sucralose than sugar to get the same sweetness? I don't think so.<br /><br />Another major problem is that Amazon's ingredients section does NOT mention Sucralose. It mentions Aspartame which, according to Wikipedia, it's 100-150 times sweeter than sugar, which means much less sweeter than Sucralose. So did Nesquick change their ingredients and Amazon did not update their ingredients list?

review/text: After my bad cholesterol hit a high of 167 my doc gave me 3 months to make some changes before we considered medications.  After some research and reading the reviews here I decided to give these chews a try.  I also cut out red meat, cheese, switched to non-fat milk and ate more produce.  I had 2 of these per day for the last 8 weeks, 1 after lunch and 1 after dinner.  I had my repeat blood work done two days ago and my bad cholesterol is now at 177....  :o(  Up 10 points in 3 months.<br /><br />Glad it works for so many, but don't assume they'll work for you and don't avoid follow-up appointments with your doctor thinking you have nothing to worry about.  You might just be one of the unlucky ones like me...

review/text: Last year my HDL was 80 and my LDL was 161.  I have always had a healthy diet and was shocked to find that my bad cholestrol was high, even though my good cholesterol was very high as well.  I started taking Benecol Smart Chews in July and with no other changes in my diet or lifestyle, my LDL dropped to 127 with my HDL at 71 at my last checkup.  My doctor was amazed as well.  I know these have been recently reformulated in some way, better tasting apparently, but I have only tried the new formula and I think they taste great, just like a little caramel.  I'm happy and am reordering another box, and one for my Mom too!

review/text: While my wife and I like Benecol, I question the pricing.  I purchased this in September, 2009 for $22.00.  Then when I went to reorder some more,  the price had jumped back to $27.99.  That is the exact same price as charged by the other two companies that sell Benecol on the internet.  This product is only available from three internet sources and all are charging the exact same retail price.  That smells of price fixing to me and raises antitrust issues.

review/summary: Wow!!!!!!  I can't believe the results!!!!!!
review/text: I have been taking this product for a few months now, along with Benefiber, to try and lower my cholesterol before my doctor put me on medication.  Before finding these products, I changed my diet radically for about a month with no results, except my HDL dropped significantly and I gave up.  Now I eat as I normally would (which has it's good and bad), and today I received the stunning results of my recent labwork.  Total cholesterol down 48 points!!!  LDL down 47 points!!!  HDL remained about the same.  Even my triglycerides went down. Now I feel as though I can change my diet a little more, keep being diligent with my workouts, increase the amount of Benefiber I'd been taking, continue to take the chews and I can hopefully drive the numbers down even more. I can't say for sure which of the two products have produced these results--maybe a combination of the two, but if you have high cholesterol and want to avoid medications, I would give this a try.<br /><br />The taste is really good, just like a caramel. They are also very convenient to take along when eating out. I make sure to keep some in my purse at all times.  Instead of taking a Benecol Chew after a meal, I take it before I eat a meal that is high in cholesterol. Even though they are expensive, I have not taken them 100% of the time and the container has lasted for quite a while.  As far as the Benefiber, I've been taking that once a day, but I'm going to increase that to 2-3 times a day.

review/text: I have been using Benecol chews for several months now.  I am one of those who absolutely cannot take statins to lower my cholesterol.  The statins will lower my cholesterol...but they cause a lot of other problems.  I do not know if the Benecol alone would lower my cholesterol because I am on Niaspan also, but my total cholesterol is down, my HDL is up, my LDL is down as well as my triglycerides.  The number and size of my LDL particles has also decreased greatly.  Research has now determined the more particles you have, the more likely they are to stick together and therefore cause blockages.  Give Benecol a try.  I will continue to use them.  I also use Benecol spread that can be found at most grocery stores.  Good luck!

review/text: These were recommended by our Endocrinologist because they contain stanols, but not sterols, and are noted to help lower cholesterol without causing harm.  We've been using them for 4 months, and cholesterol test numbers have been improved.  We prefer to avoid taking Rx drugs whenever possible, and do not like the cost and side effects of statins and other drugs for cholesterol.  Statins also block production of CoQ10, and can cause muscle damage, even kidney damage when rhabdomyolosis occurs (admittedly rare, but still a risk of statins).

review/summary: Hard to believe, but it really works!
review/text: I ate two chews twice daily for almost three months, and here are the results. My total cholesterol went from 241 to 184; HDL from 75 to 68; LDL from 153.1 to 101.8; TGL from 67 to 71. The LDL needs to drop to 99 or lower, but still a major improvement and the TGL, although it increased, is still below 150.  My HDL risk dropped from 3.2 to 2.7.  I only made one change to my diet and exercise routine, and that was to eat less cake and cookies, which I believe contained eggs (the yolk).  I tried and will continue to use Benecol chews because I do not like the side effects from Statins, other prescription cholesterol lowering drugs, and over the counter remedies (supplements, etc.).  The chews taste like caramel candies and two chews contain 35 calories, so that's 70 calories in total per day.  I may consider taking one more chew a day.

review/summary: Tasty and Helpful
review/text: Benecol Smart Chews have been a part of my daily regimen for almost two years. The plant stanols have definitely helped to lower the "lousy" LDL cholesterol (in conjunction with a doctor-prescribed statin), and I've recommended them to all my friends. The label states that Benecol can be taken 4 times a day, but my clinician advised me to take only two, and I still had dramatic results in only four months, and have maintained benefit since. By the way, I like Amazon.com's automatic shipping option so I never have to reorder or run out. There's no obligation to accept subsequent orders, and it lowers the purchase price and shipping is free. The Smart Chews taste like candy, so it's like eating a caramel (that doesn't stick in your teeth) after breakfast and dinner.

review/summary: Great Item
review/text: I have been buying this product for both my spouse and myself.  We have each been complimented by our doctors on how well we are doing.  We have increased our usage about a month ago.  I only wish it was in other flavours as I'm not fond of Carmel.

review/summary: Enjoyable
review/text: I am enjoying these Benecol Chews, I am a big chocaholic and I needed something to stop me eating so much chocolate.  Only time will tell if my cholestrol will have dropped, but I will continue to use this product.

review/summary: Benecol chews. Guaranteed to lower your cholesterol...I hope...
review/text: I recently purchased Benecol chews to help lower my cholesterol. Haven't taken them long enough for positive results yet, but they are sweet and delicious. The price is reasonable. Will be better able to comment once I have used them for a longer period of time. If they work, I will use them every day and will recommend them to others.

review/text: Good experience - I noticed no change in Benecol Smart Chews as far as the taste and ease of use!  However!  What made the price double from the last box that I purchased??  I can't afford to purchase it anymore now.  So sorry!  I'll miss you Benecol Smart Chews!  You have been helping cut my cholesterol.  Jane Hinckley

review/summary: Overall Healthy?
review/text: If I would have looked at the ingredients before purchasing, I would not have purchased this product.  The first two ingredients are sugar and corn syrup. There is also soy lecithin, which I try to avoid, if possible.  Just be aware that the use of the words smart chews may be misleading, if you try to avoid certain ingredients in "healthy" products.

review/summary: Cholesterol down, triglyceride up
review/text: I took the Benecol to lower LDL..It did..from 146 to 124... in 3 weeks.  My triglyderides rose from 155 to 198.. Also, my T.cholesterol declined to 198<br />and my HDL went down to 37.. So, back to eating healthy food and exercising MORE.<br />I had gotten off the fish oil too. Today's new food is brussel sprouts,  Vitamin C 3 times a day and maybe niacin 3X tomorrow. My BMI with the machine went down..<br />Got any natural ways to lower plaque(LDL) in arteries?
