review/summary: Perfect satisfying afternoon snack
review/text: These chocolate nutty granola clusters are addicting.  They make an excellent afternoon snack and even satisfy my chocolate cravings.  The flavor is delicious and doesn't have any artificial aftertaste like most products on the market.  They are packed with antioxidants too.  I also love that they are manufactured in the USA. I am excited to try the line of granola bars that they make too.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: These granola clusters have a good heft and body to the pieces.  Cranberry and Chocolate make a great combination and the addition of walnuts reminds me a little of brownies.<br /><br />Unlike some others who somewhat objected to the cocoa content or amount thereof, I loved it becuase I just love chocolate.  Looking at the package I knew cocoa was a major component of the snack, as well, these are a line of cocoa snacks that just happen to have additional flavorings.<br /><br />Provided nutrition data uses a slightly strainful font so I provided another.

review/summary: Crunchy, Tasty and  Energizing
review/text: We enjoyed these even more than we thought we would.  We saved them to take in the car on an upcoming road trip.  They were delicious and really hit the spot when lunchtime came and there was not an appealing drive-in or restaurant within miles.<br /><br />When we arrived at our destination we left the bag in the car.  Surprsingly enought after four days of sitting in a locked car they were just as good going home as they had been when we started out.<br /><br />Admittedly we like both cranberries and walnuts so we may be a bit partial but we would recommend this as a snack.

review/summary: Perfect for warmer weather! :)
review/text: Eat. Think. Smile. Granola Clusters, Cranberry Walnut, 12-Ounce Pouches<br /><br />...hard and crunchy -- so much so, one might just use Eat. Think. Smile. Granola Clusters, Cranberry Walnut to clean the tarter off their teeth -- like a carrot.<br /><br />Never one to shy away from trying something new, if a snack product boasts of being all natural and antioxidant -- on the front of the package --, it usually ends up in my shopping cart, especially of late, 'cuz that's the way I roll. :)<br /><br />Eat. Think. Smile. Granola Clusters, Cranberry Walnut was an especially nice surprise, as I found it to be dry and crunchy, not messy and sticky (which is a big "plus" in warmer weather), with an extraordinarily satisfying cocoa/cranberry/walnut taste -- that did not leave me feeling bloated/over stuffed, if ya know what I mean.<br /><br />The extra thick zip-lock like re sealable bag really came in handy, as I was tempted to eat more than one of the 10 portions contained in the bag.  It is that good!  :)<br /><br />Cons:  Although extraordinarily delicious, Granola Clusters, Cranberry Walnut nuggets seemed a bit hard to chew -- but that may be subjective -- as I have very expensive dental work that I tend to be overly cautious about -- , so I won't deduct a "star" for that.<br /><br />You might also like to try a couple of other Eat.

review/summary: A Hershey's "health and wellness" product
review/text: This product is manufactured and distributed by Apure Foods, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hershey's founded in 2010 "to bring cocoa-based health and wellness products to consumers", according to the Hershey's website.<br /><br />That being said, my wife and I thought it was pretty good. We both enjoyed it and will likely purchase it once in a while in the future.<br /><br />The taste took some getting used to, as it is not overly sweet-tasting. It is made with cocoa rather than chocolate, for example, and although brown sugar is ingredient no. 2 after oats, it tastes "healthier" than you would think after reading the ingredients list. The combination of the cocoa and cranberry flavors is unusual, and struck us as original.<br /><br />The nutritional information indicates that a 35-gram serving contains 24g carbohydrate (including 13g sugars and 3g fiber), 7g fat (including 2g saturated) and 3g protein.<br /><br />All in all, a good offering for those who can afford the carbs, and a surprise for me to learn that Hershey's even has a "health and wellness" segment.

review/summary: Good snack
review/text: This is a great snacking granola.  I was kind of surprised to see the big, hard chunks, since I think of granola as a breakfast-cereal type of thing and this surely isn't.  in fairness, the picture on the bag does depict them as big chunks. "Hard" was a bit of a surprise, though.  They seem to be playing on the new "chocolate is good for you!" thinking, since these are very liberally dusted in cocoa powder and the package features its antioxidant properties; the cocoa flavor pretty much overwhelms the cranberry and walnut contributions.  They are very tasty, though, and the ingredients are very straightforward.  I found the cocoa flavor paired excellently with coffee, and they are healthier than most of the sweets I would choose with coffee.

review/summary: Chocolatey Crunchy Goodness
review/text: It's hard to find granola that doesn't have an ingredient list that looks like a chemical factory AND that tastes good, but this one fits the bill: oats, sugar, walnuts, palm oil, cocoa, crisp rice, cranberries, cinnamon, salt, almonds. The only questionable ingredients are "natural flavor" (which could be almost anything) and soy lecithin. Although high in sugars (like most snacks), it is relatively low fat. I liked the mild chocolate taste and consistency.

review/summary: Addictive once you acquire the cocoa flavor -- although many sugars
review/text: I like the idea behind this company's products: foods with what they claim is very high in antioxidants, particularly revolving around their proprietary cocoa blend. The ingredients looks simple and natural, so I decided to try it. It does have 13 grams of sugars per 35 grams of product, so I wasn't terribly excited about that (brown sugar, evaporated cane juice, sugar and honey).<br /><br />When I first tried it, I wasn't quite sure what it supposed to be -- a cereal or a snack. I found it to be on the hard, crunchy side, but not too hard. The pieces are rather large, so it just doesn't work as a cereal. At first, it made me think of eating granola with bitter cocoa powder on the outside, but I quickly acquired the taste and really got to like it. The cranberries and the cocoa are the dominant flavors, which is a unique combination to me and one that I now enjoy. My wife tried one and thought it tasted awful.. I liked the first four bags so much that I bought another 4-pack.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: The first bowl of this cereal took me by surprise because of a combination of flavors that I wasn't used to eating together. It only took a second bowl to really like it. The chocolate flavor is pretty intense, and the cranberry taste is prominent as well. Once I had eaten this combination of flavors a couple of times it really tasted good to me.<br /><br />Not only is it good with milk on it (holds it's crunch instead of getting mushy), but great on ice cream and yogurt too.<br /><br />If you like Cocoa Puffs but want a more grown-up cereal made with whole grains and 3 grams of fiber per serving, give this unusual granola a try, or better yet several tries. If you are like me, this strangely satisfying flavor will grow on you quickly.

review/summary: delicious
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised at how good this granola was.  The chocolate was a nice flavor, not too sweet. You can distinctly taste the cranberries, while the walnuts added more of a subtle flavor. The dried cranberries were soft, and the walnuts were in small unobtrusive bits.  The granola tastes good in vanilla yogurt, but I mostly eat it by itself.  Granola is always dense in calories, but I found the serving size of 1/3 cup was more than enough for a large snack.  Generally, I eat about 1/4 of a cup, which looks small but is deceptively filling.  The 12-ounce pack is a large size and will last a while.  Mine has been opened a month and is not stale at all, plus the pack reseals nicely.  It's the best granola I have had, and I would definitely recommend giving it a try.

review/summary: Healthy snack.  A bit over tough.
review/text: I snacked on it some and then my husband ate the rest of it before I got to writing this review.  This has a pleasant slightly sweet and cocoa taste.  I remember tasting cranberry a bit and but don't remember tasting the walnut.  I'd prefer some nice big chunks of walnut.<br /><br />I appreciated:  No high fructose corn syrup.  No peanuts.  We reject many granola products because of a peanut allergy and this doesn't have peanuts.<br /><br />My complaint about it is that its bit too hard to chew for me and it you eat too much it does rather feel like rocks in your stomach.  I realize that granola is not the easiest thing to chew, but this seems a bit harder than usual.  That didn't stop me from snacking on it, but it did limit how much of it I would eat at once.

review/summary: Too Hard and Chewy
review/text: As with the almond cinnamon flavor this granola is largely made up of big hard chunks.  The addition of berries in this flavor makes it not only hard but chewy too.  I tried it dry as a snack and I tried it in a bowl with almond milk.  It is best as a dry snack because it's so hard and chunky.  The flavor is okay but nothing to get excited about and the texture (big hard and chewy clusters) makes it difficult to eat, especially with milk on it and using a spoon.  Update - I put chunks of peeled sweet potato in the container I had the granola in, put the lid on, and next day the granola was way better.  Not nearly so hard so I could enjoy the taste more.  This would work even better with a cut up apple but I didn't have one

review/text: I found this to be a great snack. The crunch was amazing and the taste a good mix of sweet and tangy.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the rich chocolate flavor. It was more of a semisweet than a milk chocolate. I am a fan of dark chocolate, so I didn't mind. Secondly, the crunch is so satisfying when trying the less it more approach. Sure, it might be granola and be 'healthy', but it is still chocolate, right? Lastly, the tang of the cranberries really brought the flavors home.<br /><br />I used it on frozen yogurt and it was so good. My husband tried it in vanilla yogurt and enjoyed it. My kids just ate it by the handful as after school snacks.<br /><br />The only negative is the fact that the bag goes stale before my family could eat it all.

review/text: For a price equal to a bag or "regular granola" snacks, these are just fantastic.<br /><br />They are crunchy, chewy, and perfect on the sweetness scale (in our opinion). Probably not the best thing if you are looking for a cereal...(and this is the reason for the 4 instead of 5 star--though we weren't looking for a cereal): some of the clusters are on the large size-even for granola snackers like us.<br /><br />Nothing but nature in the bag AND a healthful snack provided you don't sit down and polish off a whole bag which IS a danger because they are so good.<br /><br />We can't wait to try the other flavours. These are well worth your snacking dollars!

review/summary: Cranberry Walnut goodness that's good with a salad
review/text: This is bite-size granola in a package that can be eaten a few at a time as a snack.  Each package is 12 oz. and there are ten 1.2 ounce servings in each bag. Each serving is 160 calories with 60 calories from fat.  There are 3 grams of protein and 13 grams of sugar in each serving.  Each serving also constitutes a daily dietary intake of 12% in fiber and 8% in carbs. The first three ingredients are whole grain rolled oats, brown sugar, and walnuts.  Cranberries are 8th on the ingredient list.<br /><br />I am use to eating my granola with milk so this was a new twist on a what was formally a cerael.  I felt these were dry but they tasted good.  Drinking a glass of milk took away most of the dryness.  There is a high cocoa and cinnamon flavor and the cranberries tasted like raisins to me.  I didn't taste the walnuts at all. As a result, I felt the flavor was a bit muted but still good.<br /><br />Obviously granola is a high calorie snack and it's hard to eat just 1.2 ounces.  Nevertheless, I feel it's much better to eat this than candy and cake.  After having tried these, this is not a snack I would purchase because of the dryness and the muted flavor.  However, I've been eating these for a couple of days and have discovered that putting these clusters in a salad takes away the dryness and gives the salad a nice crunch (like croutons) in addition to adding additional flavor.<br /><br />I had my boyfriend try these and he likes them.

review/summary: Interesting snack
review/text: Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Cranberry Walnut Clusters is an interesting snack that I've started to enjoy more after trying it a few times.  It's not my favorite flavor of this product, and it's not exactly health food, but I don't think there would be an issue in enjoying this treat in moderation.<br /><br />Eat Think Smile Cranberry Walnut Granola Clusters is made up of large granola clusters, too big to be eaten easily as a breakfast cereal but just the right size for snacking. The most obvious ingredients are oats, walnut bits, cocoa, and small bits of cranberry.  Cranberries are fairly far down the list of ingredients, and as a result in many bites I really didn't detect any cranberry flavor.  There is also a barely detectable amount of cinnamon added.  I was ready to knock this product down a star because I didn't think it was nearly as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BPVA3A">Eat. Think. Smile. Granola Clusters, Cinnamon Almond, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 4)</a>; but after trying it again I rather enjoyed the plainer flavor of this mix.<br /><br />Now as I mentioned above I would not consider this product health food, despite the claims on the package about the antioxidant power of the cocoa and cranberries.  After all, a small serving contains 7 grams of fat and 13 grams of sugar, and among the ingredients listed are brown sugar, palm oil, and evaporated sugar cane juice. But as a substitute for more highly processed sweets this will do OK.  In summary this is a good product; it's not as tasty as their Cinnamon Almond Granola, but if you want a subtler taste this may be a good choice.

This has a great cheese flavor with a well-rounded and seasoned raspberry note.  Cut this up for crackers and warm it in the microwave for a bit... cheese lover's paradise!  Both "raspberry-holics" and plain old cheese lover's will adore this stuff.  It's so good that I almost didn't want to clue the rest of you in.  I guess that I'm just too nice a guy to keep it a secret!  Enjoy!

review/summary: good for hairball control
review/text: I have an 18 year old Siamese cat who has developed hairball problems in the last year or so.  She is pretty finicky, but likes this food.  I can say that I have seen improvement in her health and well being since placing her onto this diet.  The classic version of the food works well for my cat as she doesn't have a lot of teeth.

review/summary: Hill's Scient Diet Hairball Control Canned Cat Food (Seafood)
review/text: I have a one year old cat and a senior cat.  The senior cat--a fussy eater with no teeth--was eating another brand of canned cat food, but preferred to "gum" dry kibble most of the time.  When I bought the Science Diet, she enjoyed it right away and now prefers it exclusively.  In retrospect, I believe the other brand may have been upsetting her stomach; she slept all the time, had issues with hairballs and was not interested in play at all.  I had attributed this behavior to her age, but since I switched her to the Science Diet she has begun to play again and her coat is extremely soft and shining.  The hairballs have stopped entirely.  I'm very glad I bought it.  (All of that said, the young cat will not touch it.)  So you might test it out before buying in quantity.  Overall, I'm thrilled with what it has done for my senior cat.

review/summary: Good memories
review/text: These are not full-sized Swedish Fish. Each one here is around 3cm long, or about half the normal size you may remember.<br /><br />That said, these fill the bill in every other way. The four traditional colors and flavors are spot-on (most people like the red, I prefer the orange and green). The texture is just right--not as hard and rubbery as modern gummy bears but very chewy and long-lasting. The surface turns white and they crack just right when you pull or twist them. The entire bag was well-sealed and fresh. These are the same Swedish Fish I remember from shopping with my mom at Emporium Capwell's in the 1970's in every way, except for the size.<br /><br />Of course, I am not the same size either. If this size is the new way, then so be it. (The fish.)<br /><br />Edit: I see many different vendors selling this item now. My order was sold by SweetGourmet.com, LLC and shipped by Amazon via Prime 2-day.

review/summary: Not as good as Planters, but acceptable
review/text: One of our family members is a Spanish peanut lover and eats a few every day, so we try to keep some on hand.<br /><br />I ordered these because the Planters brand was temporarily sold out.<br /><br />On the plus side, when ordered from Amazon.com Herman's cost less per ounce than Planters. When I wrote this review, according to my not-always-reliable math, Herman's Spanish peanuts were about 16 cents per ounce while Planter's were about 21 cents per ounce.<br /><br />On the minus side, there is a difference in quality. Herman's Spanish peanuts are not as fresh smelling or tasting, and they are not as tender. They also don't have that nice shine that Planters Spanish peanuts have.<br /><br />They aren't bad. They're acceptable if you're looking to save some money. But for a Spanish peanut connoisseur like our family member, they just aren't as satisfying as Planters.

review/summary: My "House Yeast" for Home Brewing
review/text: A couple years ago, I decided to simplify my home brewing operation and focus on really "nailing" a few recipes (instead of always brewing something different).  And part of that process was choosing a single yeast to harvest, store and re-use.  2308 has a reputation for being excellent but temperamental.  I have found it amazingly versatile.<br /><br />As you might expect, I use this for all my European lagers, but I also use it for my porters and stouts, fermenting at higher temperatures--think of "steam" beer.  And, in fact, my IPAs are just that--steam beer (which many beer experts have said resemble IPAs more than anything else).<br /><br />So even if you don't decide to choose a single yeast as I did, with a little planning, you could do a series of beers from a single packet of 2308, save yourself a few bucks--and end up with some very nice beer.

review/summary: Foojoy China Green Tea, 2g X 100 Teabags
review/text: This tea changed my life! I had been trying for several years to switch to green tea for its health benefits, after falling in love with the wonderful flavor of the green tea served up by my favorite Thai restaurant. However, none of the green teas in my local supermarkets had the smooth, consistent flavor that I craved. Then, on vacation in Florida three years ago, I happened to visit the China Pavilion at Epcot Center, and there I found an array of very authentic looking Chinese green teas with the Foojoy brand. After studying the descriptions of the various teas on display, I purchased several cartons of Foojoy China Green Tea, shipping all but one back home and keeping one carton to enjoy on vacation. To my delight, I discovered that this was the only green tea I had ever tried that could be made with boiling water and still taste deliciously smooth, with no trace of bitterness. I quickly made the transition to drinking this particular green tea almost exclusively. I have yet to find a local supplier, and so I have adopted the habit of purchasing through Amazon, buying several cartons at a time so as to reduce the impact of the shipping charges. Foojoy China Green Tea is very consistent in flavor, smooth and delightful. The only issue I have encountered is that sometimes a teabag becomes detached from its string, but that seems a very minor inconvenience considering how much I enjoy the tea.

You can add honey to it if you need a little sweetness, I prefer it unsweetened though.

review/summary: Awesome Marinade!
review/text: I recently purchased this marinade when I was looking for something different to do to a pork loin.  My husband and I are big fans of smokey flavors (grilled, BBQ'd, etc.), so when I saw this item, I decided to give it a try.  I did cut holes in the pork loin and stuffed in whole cloves of garlic and also sprinkled the whole thing with meat tenderizer as well as this marinade (which I injected into the meat about every 2 inches or so).  I then put the whole thing in a zipper bag and marinaded it for 24 hours.  I then baked the loin in a shallow pan at 325 for about an hour (maybe a little longer).  When I cut into this loin, the juices just ran out all over it!  The pork was so tender and juicy and the flavor is just fantastic!!  I think this is just about the best marinade I've ever had!  If you like the taste of soy-ish flavored items, you'll love this.  It looks and smells a great deal like soy sauce, but has a smokey flavor.  My husband says this is WAY better than any of those pre-seasoned pork loins you buy in the store.  I also shared it with my best friend (who is an AWESOME cook) and she really liked it.  Gotta give this item a try!  I give it 10 out of 5 stars, because 5 isn't quite enough....

review/summary: Royal Canin Dry Dog Food
review/text: If you have a Shih Tzu this is the dog food for him or her. Our little Shih Tzu (Tasha) is around 13 years old, had dry skin and was overweight. We've gone through two 10 lb bags and her condition has completely changed. Her skin is not dry any more and she is losing weight. We are feeding her the recommended amount which is 1 cup a day divided into two 1/2 cup meals. She acts better and as I said her skin is no longer dried out and she doesn't sit there and scratch and lick like she normally does during this dry Northeast Winter. She is losing weight which we are thrilled about and is more active.<br />Compare the ingredients in this to an off the shelf brand like Pur--- F-t & Tr-m. What you will find is staggering and unhealthy for your little pooch. Switching to Royal Canin has made a real healthy difference for our Tasha. Yes, it does cost more per bag, but when you use it in the amounts recommended it lasts longer.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9WUG0">Royal Canin Dry Dog Food, Shih Tzu 24 Formula, 10-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: Good going in and coming out
review/text: I love this dog food for my shih tzu because it us all she needs to eat. A big bag lasts a long, long time, so transfer it out into smaller, airtight containers to maintain the good smells.<br /><br />When on this food, my dog has an easy time of passing a stool and the stool is never gooey or gross ( for dog poop!) I think that is because the formula for this brand makes it digestible, but I am not qualified to diagnose any health problems via poop inspection.<br />I just know that when my dog can "go" without strain or whine, and I can clean it up easily, it is a good thing for both of us.

review/text: Well I asked both of my dogs and they said thanks for putting us back on Royal Canin!! We spent a year trying other dog food but they do much better on Royal Canin its developed just for their breed, yes it seems expensive for 10lbs. but thats a months worth of food so its not expensive and their Vet told me to put them back on it. I also like that its delivered to my door.

review/summary: Royal Canin Dry Dog Food  for my Shi Tzu
review/text: As I do not eat this dog food, I am unable to rate for taste, texture, smell, etc. However, based on my dog Buddy's appetite, I'd have to rate this dog food as the best! Buddy gobbles it up, and he doesn't throw up from eating this dry dog food. We've tried other specialty designer dog foods, and he would have the dry heaves or throw up the food within a few hours. This food must satisfy his nutritional requirements as he doesn't need to eat as much quantity nor does he need to eat frequently, and he's healthy and active with a beautiful coat. A great product for the price.

review/text: This bag has lasted about 5 months for our 10lb Shih Tzu / Poodle (I think) mix. Our dog is hardly finicky but he does like this food and when not concerned with what I'm eating (beef, beer, it all looks good) he really goes for this. One thing about this brand of food - it must not have as much fluff / filler as some others since the "waste" piles are smaller and firmer, which is nice for clean up. The smaller 2.5lb bag is about the same price locally as on Amazon, but this 10lb bag is a great deal and delivered right to the door you can't beat it.

review/text: My two little shih tzus really like this food.  I have tried to change to an organic food but the younger one prefers this one and the older one likes just about anything so we stay with this food.  I like the convenience of ordering this on Amazon as I work a lot and cannot always get to the pet store.  The price is also better on Amazon and the pet store doesn't carry this size bag, just the smaller bags which are really expensive!  I like the nugget size for my little dogs as they can chew it up much easier and their coats seem to be soft and their eyes not so runny with this food.  It also gets pretty high ratings at the dog food analysis sites too.  So all in all pretty happy and if it works I won't change it.

review/summary: Elijah Craig 12 is mature, sophisticated, and excellent: the greatest bargain in all the spirit world.
review/text: If you're looking for absolutely the best distilled spirit you can buy for the money (an issue that used to come up every Friday night in my younger days) you simply cannot do better than Elijah Craig 12.  It's an under-appreciated classic of American bourbon crafting.  You simply cannot buy a distilled spirit of any kind from any country remotely close to this refinement and quality for anywhere close to the bargain basement low price of Elijah Craig 12.  It's a stone. cold. bargain.  Have I said that enough?<br /><br />In the glass it's dark burnished bronze with a molten luminescent core: beautiful and rich.  The aroma blooms with lots of time, like a good whiskey should: corn on the cob, black fruits (prune / fig) sawn oak, and old tanned leather.  First sip and I'm amazed at how dry and sophisticated this is for bourbon.  There's burnt caramel and corn fruitiness - but muted below the rich oak tannins and wood resin.  You can taste the years this whiskey has laid in the rich wood.  Mid palate has big red fruit notes married to the wood, a sophisticated sherry-like presentation.  Finish is long and complex with faint drifts of sandalwood and distant smoke weaving in among the buttered corn, hot spirit, sherry and tanned leather.  The dark fudgy edge curbing the fruit sweetness reminds me of bitter orange or very dark chocolate.  This is a top flight bourbon flavor extravaganza that feels lean and sinewy while at the same time as it manages to be sweet and rich.  The red fruit speaks of sunlight and sugar while the dark wood and bitter notes speak of age and darkness.  This is excellent depth of flavor and character.<br /><br />This bourbon would be impressive regardless of price.  At this price (the same as any ordinary mass market bottle of hooch) it's astounding.  This bourbon is of a piece with fine single malts or vsop/xo cognac.  Sip it slow and neat in a small glass.  I pray they never come to their senses.

review/text: I bought these cow ears for my 10-month-old labrador retriever.  They are a lower-calorie and lower-fat alternative when compared with pig's ears.  My dog loves them!  Some of them are larger than others, and they are not huge, but the majority of them are good-sized.  They may not be as big as the ones I get at the pet store, but I pay 50% to 100% more for those than I did for these.  I think that for the price, they were excellent.

review/text: I just spoke with the manufacturer's USA rep who told me that this product will no longer be distributed in the USA. Their replacement sucralose product "Ideal" does not contain probiotics.  He said the added probiotics just didn't catch on here so they couldn't compete with other brand's no calorie sweeteners.  Ironically, they still manufacture and sell Nevella in many other countries. It's too bad they didn't promote this product. I never saw any advertising about it outside my grocery store (Meijer).

review/summary: Very enjoyable decaf
review/text: I've tried several of the Coffee Bean Direct decafs, and this is probably my favorite. Smooth flavor, but with enough depth to make it interesting. The roast is a medium-dark with just a wee bit of oil on the bean. Dark enough to give it a robust flavor but light enough that you don't get a burnt taste. That perfect middle-of-the-road spot!<br /><br />Coffee Bean Direct also makes a CO2 processed decaf Columbian, but I actually prefer the taste of this, even though it is made using the chemical decaf method. This has more flavor and richness than the CO2 processed version.<br /><br />If you're concerned about the package size and the beans going stale, it freezes well. I pack the beans in a Mason jar, then remove the air using a food vacuum and this attachment: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005TN7H">FoodSaver T03-0023-01 Wide-Mouth Jar Sealer</a><br /><br />Keeps for months in the freezer without any appreciable loss of flavor. Be sure to let the jar come up to room temperature before opening it so you don't get condensation on the cold beans (I usually leave the jar sit for a day before opening it). You also should not defrost and re-freeze the beans - use a jar that is sized to hold about what you would use up in a week (for me, that's a quart size jar).<br /><br />Highly recommend!

I have purchased this coffee several times now and see no reason not to buy it a again. The price is reasonable at about $7 a pound (for my blend), and produces a full flavored coffee with half the caffeine, nor do I notice the "burnt" flavor that I normally get with a decaf product.

review/summary: They are fried; you might as well eat potato chips
review/text: From the back of the bag:<br /><br />2.5 servings per 2.5oz bag<br /><br />per SERVING:<br />150 calories<br />9g of fat<br /><br />375 calories/22.5g of fat per BAG<br /><br />Compare to a Bare product:[...] a 2.6 oz bag from Bare has 174 calories and no fat.<br /><br />I don't get it.  You might as well eat potato chips.  And they taste greasy.  If you're looking for an apple flavored potato chip, try these.  Otherwise avoid the entire brand.

review/summary: Dried Peaches 2Lbs
review/text: We did not know that a product existed like this. We begin to reminisce about the great fried pies we had growing up. So, I begin my own research. We found this product on Amazon. Fried pies, peach cobbler, you can even make peach preserves!! Beautifully packaged, even better, a wonderful product. This product is nothing like the "dried" product you fine in stores, that is, if you can find them. They are 10x better. Thanks for a wonderful product! Next time, I need to order more, I'll submit a video of  my golden fried peach pies.

review/text: My hats off to Candy Express. These are the best dried peaches I have ever seen and eaten. Large, flavorful and delicious. In the past I have always purchased my dried fruits at Trader Joes, whose products are excellent, but these are better. I will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Tastes LIke Earl Grey, Good Imitation of the Real Thing
review/text: ***<br />Tazo's Earl Grey Black Tea is very perfumy. I am used to drinking super-premium teas that have the real bergamot added, not the essence. So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot". To me it was contrived and chemical-ly.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for premium tea.<br /><br />Instead of Tazo's Earl Grey, I would highly recommend Numi Earl Grey, which does not disappoint in any way and is comparable in cost.<br /><br />Not recommended, unless you don't mind somewhat artificial and chemical flavors in your tea.<br />***
