review/summary: Heavy ginger
review/text: I love ginger, but this was a bit too much. I couldn't taste anything but ginger and it burned my mouth more than I like.  Ginger is great for digestion and the ingredients seem wholesome enough.  So if you are drinking purely for health reasons,ok.  However I prefer to simply eat ginger rather than not enjoy a beverage.  The honey and lemon were lost on me.  I didn't HATE this drink, but it wasn't something. I will recommend to friends or keep on hand.

review/summary: A little intense
review/text: I love ginger which is why I tried Gold Kili.  Unfortunately at the recommended strength it was too strong for me.  For someone who eats crystalized ginger that's rather surprising.  And the flavor is good when hot, but once it cools down, it has a peculiar and not very pleasant quality to it.<br /><br />All things considered, I'm not sold on this, though if I wasn't concerned that it's what's made me sick today, I'd be willing to try it again at about half strength.<br /><br />Strange product.  If you love ginger, try it, but use caution.

review/summary: A nice way to enjoy the benefits of ginger
review/text: I'm a big fan of ginger drinks - they do wonders for settling my stomach, and taste good to boot. My normal ginger drink is to brew some black tea and then add about a half'ish teaspoon of ground ginger (I'm particularly fond of this brand: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNGMPM">Frontier Ginger Root Ground non-sulfited, 16 Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>). It makes for a very strong ginger "bite" that I enjoy.<br /><br />This product is not as strong, but is still quite pleasant. I made this as a cold drink and it was very enjoyable - the ginger is there but not strong, and the honey is a good match in terms of taste.<br /><br />While I'll continue to use my hot tea with ginger most of the time, this would be a nice alternative for days when it is too hot for a hot beverage. Highly recommend, provided you enjoy the taste of ginger in a beverage.

review/summary: Very, very gingery
review/text: This hot beverage tastes like a liquid version of candied ginger, which I like very much. I liked this drink, too; it smelled delicious, and while it was a bit harsh in the first sip, once my mouth got used to the gingery tang, it was very good. There was plenty of honey flavor too, and little (almost no) lemon flavor.<br /><br />I love it, but again, I like ginger. For those who don't want their mouths burning, maybe adding a packet of this drink to a pitcher of lemonade will give it a "kick" without the burn.

review/summary: flavor okay, but too much ginger.
review/text: I only took a couple sips of this before I decided it wasn't for me.  The first sip sort of burned the back of my throat as it went down, and it wasn't because of the temperature.  The second sip was a little better, I guess I was expecting it, but still too much ginger for my taste buds.  The lemon was sort of an after taste, which wasn't bad.  There were not directions on the package as to how much water to use.  Perhaps it was meant for two cups, or a VERY large mug?<br />  Maybe if it was mixed with tea and diluted it would be better.

review/summary: If you love ginger...
review/text: Ginger, lemmon and honey?  That sounds like a decent combination, so I picked this instant mix to try out.<br /><br />When I first opened the packet I smelled lemon and wondered where the ginger was.  But then after sipping this, I quickly learned that the ginger is in the drink!  Soon my mouth and then my lips smacked of ginger, and it got worse with each sip.<br /><br />This is caffeine free, and for people enjoying a hot drink late at night that won't turn them into zombies, this is an option.  The lemon and honey naturally sweeten this drink, but the more you drink this, the more your lips burn.  This may be perfect for that ginger lover in some, but it's definitely a taste sensation that requires getting used to.

review/text: I tried the Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger and Lemon Beverage mix as a hot beverage and it was fine. It had a ginger and lemon aroma. I was just getting over a sore throat and the ginger drink made my throat feel better. It did not taste like a 73 calorie drink. To me it tasted a little weak, but I added milk to my cup and enjoyed a lovely cup of ginger and lemon. I would recommend this beverage to anyone who enjoys the mixture of ginger and lemon in a hot or cold drink.

review/text: This drink tasted absolutely awful to me.  I don't think I could even force myself to drink this if offered big bucks to do so.  I took one sip and cringed.  The taste was awful and very bitter.  I tried to force myself to take another sip but I could barely get it past my lips.  It was horrible.  My husband tried it and so did my daughter and neither of them like it either.  The smell was really bad as well.  Just smelling it made me want to get sick.  I know this is a harsh review but it's 100% honest.<br /><br />I've never had a Ginger & Lemon drink before but, I enjoy lemonade as well has hot or cold tea in many different varieties but this is not something that I would recommend to anybody.

review/text: The full strength taste of this ginger/lemon drink is too strong for my taste, but diluting it by using half as much of the powder just means it makes twice as many servings.

review/summary: Not For Me
review/text: Let me preface to say I have had dire stomach issues since a small child.  Acid reflux corrodes my insides and often times I turn to Ginger-Ale when I can consume nothing else.  But, as we know, Ginger-Ale has lots of sugar, a load of sodium and a great deal of carbonation.  When I spotted, "Ginger Kili All Natural Ginger and Lemon Beverage" I thought I had found a wonderful solution.  My doctor had even suggested sucking on ginger lozenges that are at a available at health food stores.  I thought I had one-upped him with this product.<br /><br />Happily, I brewed the hot water just knowing that I would love the combination ginger, lemon and honey.  I am deeply fond of all those tastes.  I poured it into my cup of boiling water, allowed to cool a bit and drank a hearty sip.  Oh my goodness, I have never tasted anything so vile since that horrid cod-liver oil that still haunts my memories of childhood.  This is just awful.<br /><br />I will NOT be finishing the cup of Gold Kili nor will I ever buy another package.<br /><br />I hope others find it soothing.....I can't get that awful taste out of my mouth.

review/summary: Way too overpowering on the ginger and not enough lemon
review/text: First of all, I got this because ginger is really good for the body and I love lemons. I am not ginger's biggest fan when it comes to taste so I was hoping that this product would be more balanced because of the lemon. I got the packet and it's easy to mix it into some water and it dissolves pretty well. I could not finish this drink at all. I think I only got half way before it got to be too much for me.<br /><br />The ginger taste is so strong that you really do not taste the lemon at all. There was maybe a tiny bit of lemon flavor but really it was just the ginger flavor. This is great if you are a huge ginger fan but it was definitely not for me and probably for anyone who is just so so on ginger, this will not be their cup of tea. Basically, you are just eating pure ginger.<br /><br />I let my husband have a taste and even he, who is a lot more into ginger than I am, thought it was a bit too much. This should be called instant ginger beverage mix instead of ginger & lemon beverage mix.

review/summary: You better like GINGER a lot~ it kills the lemon
review/text: Was so excited to try this. I received one single serving and was rather disappointed I didn't get a box as I love lemon, my very favorite flavor. I mixed it with the 8 oz of hot water and it doesn't quite look like the box, mine was darker. First sip and I was very disappointed, yikes it is ginger to the max. I like ginger but this is almost ginger gone bad and I couldn't taste the lemon at all. Now I was glad I had only one packet.<br /><br />Wanting to give it another chance I put it in the fridge and later added ice to see if it was any better. The answer was no. It made me feel kind of sick and that is strange because ginger is so good for the stomach. I had no ingredients to look at on the pack all I know it was made in Singapore. If you like SERIOUS ginger then this is for you.

review/text: The Gold Kili Ginger & Lemon Beverage is an all natural Hot Ginger drink made in Singapore. The Drink has a lovely aroma and taste of pure ginger which isn't overpowering. However if you're sensitive to spices I would probably stay away. The Ginger drink gives your throat a very soothing feeling, and is ofter used to help improve colds, immunity & motion sickness. It is a relatively low calorie drink with only 73 calories per serving. I really enjoyed it, and would recommend adding milk for a rather tasty Hongkong style ginger milk tea.

review/summary: A bit of an odd taste
review/text: I love ginger and love trying new teas, so I was excited to try this product.  This is an instant beverage mix that come in a pouch and can actually be served in two ways, either cold or hot.<br /><br />I choose to try this product hot, as a tea.  There was no steeping involved:  the instructions simply stated to add boiling water and then to serve immediately.  I did like the ginger flavor, but I think it was the lemon that gave this product and odd taste, sort of syrup-y and medicinal.<br /><br />In the end, as a hot beverage, this was just okay--drinkable, but that's about it.  I much prefer Yogi Tea's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QLG">Yogi Ginger, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> (they also make a Lemon Ginger for those who want the lemon flavor as well; I  prefer without, but Yogi's certainly does not have the odd taste of this tea).

review/summary: Harsh and Less than Enjoyable
review/text: Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger and Lemon is a powdered drink mix that can be served using either hot or cold water. The fine powder dissolves quickly and the beverage is mixed and ready to drink in less than one minute.<br /><br />I like the taste of lemons and ginger, but I wasn't prepared for the taste of this beverage. I admit that it does have a nice, enticing aroma and the combination of these two ingredients sounds appealing, both for the potential flavor and for the settling effects on the stomach. However, the taste of this beverage is not what I expected. It doesn't taste as natural as I thought it would and it has a certain harshness that is most evident in the back of the throat. I followed the directions and added a cup of hot water, but considering the harsh flavor, perhaps I should have used more water.<br /><br />Among the flavors present, the ginger is the one most noticeable and it's the spicy finish that creates that harshness. I was able to finish mine off by taking only small sips at a time, but I can understand why some would have a difficult time drinking this instant beverage. My enjoyment of spicy foods and drinks made it a little more tolerable for me, but I would bet that others would have a difficult time consuming this drink.<br /><br />Ginger and lemons might be a nice combination, but they don't mesh very well in this instance. I won't be buying this drink again, as I found it less smooth and less enjoyable than its taste combination promises.

review/summary: Good Strong Flavor
review/text: Ginger has the somewhat contradictory quality of being both harsh and soothing, which makes for a great complex flavor.  I think that flavor is captured well in this tea by Kili, and the sweet honey taste and mild lemon only serve to accentuate the ginger rather than steal the ginger's spotlight.  I could drink this every day.<br /><br />In terms of quantity, the package calls for 250 mls of water, which fit a tea cup pretty perfectly.  The granulated nature of the product means it is truly instant and dissolves perfectly, but it also seems to dull the flavor a bit.

review/text: I am not afraid of strong ginger flavor. All ginger teas will have that bit of harshness that defines ginger, but this ginger tea smacked of unnatural harshness & bitterness that seems to only be capable of having been produced from the use of some mutant low quality ginger (if real ginger at all). It left my mouth way too dry and no matter how far I thinned it out with more water or mixed with other liquids, the awful bitterness/dryness powered through. Looking for a balanced, smooth, nicely flavored ginger tea? This is not it.

review/summary: Strong Ginger Flavor - Recommended Served Hot
review/text: This Gold Kili "Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix" is quite strong if an entire packet is used in a normal 12oz sized cup, but just about right (for me) at half strength. This is an interesting combination of flavors, with the ginger being significantly more prominent than the more subtle lemon and honey.<br /><br />I first tried this made hot on a morning with a sore throat (likely from snoring) and found it to be nicely soothing and enjoyable (at half strength). Later in the day we tried it cold and, while it was drinkable, it was not as good and really reminded us more of a medical concoction (couldn't even imagine how overpowering it would be at full strength).<br /><br />So, at half strength, this is a very nice warm ginger beverage that works wonders on a rough throat but, for my tastes, a little too much as a cold drink.<br /><br />Recommended, with the caveats above.<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Delicious Tea with a Kick
review/text: Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage is a delicious and satisfying hot tea that reminds me a lot of those gummy, crystal, sweetened, ginger snacks.  The aroma is mostly lemon with a decent whiff of ginger.  The taste is dominated by ginger with a subtle lemon flavor and a bit of honey.  The sweetness and tartness are just enough to lend a terrific complement of flavor.  The palate feels smooth, with a medium-light body and HUGE ginger burn on the back of the throat.  While ginger and lemon aren't among my favorite flavors, I really loved this tea and would recommend it to any tea drinker, but especially those who love ginger.<br /><br />I also tried this tea as an iced tea, but since it has no bitterness and only a mild sweetness, the flavors fell flat when cold.  The ginger is much less noticeable when cold as well.  If you add some black tea and/or sugar, it might work out better as an iced tea, but my recommendation is to drink it hot.

Sometimes the old ways are the best ways, and this is a perfect example of a tea that is beneifical as well as thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />Better yet -  don't wait to feel bad to enjoy something really good.

review/summary: Pleasant and Soothing But I Use Less Than Suggested
review/text: First, thank you to the reviewers who noted that a single packet is really too much for a single mug of beverage.  Because of that, I used a lesser amount and tried this instant mix as both a hot and a cold beverage.<br /><br />I was pleased that it dissolved quite quickly in cold (actually the temperature of tap) water.  I wasn't sure how well that would work.  No problem.  However, I preferred the taste of it as a hot beverage.  I don't think I would have liked it had I used the whole packet in only one cup of water, as suggested on the Amazon page.  I'm pretty sure that it would have tasted both too strong and too sweet for me.  I've discovered that it also makes a nice addition to regular hot tea, adds a little flavor boost.<br /><br />This is a nice, soothing beverage, and I think I would especially appreciate it when fighting a cold or being a bit under the weather.  The ginger/lemon/honey combination is flavorful, and although I love ginger at any time, it is even more welcome when I need something comforting and gentle on my stomach.  The ginger is prevalent enough to give this just a slight spicy bite.

I have acid reflux (GRD)and am fond of the more holistic treatments than constantly reaching for the tums. Ginger is one such holistic recommendation for GRD. It is also great for sore throats. Generally I drink a Thai ginger drink (Hotta)which isn't quite as spicy, but has no sweetener added to it. Kili's is a great alternative. Warning--if you are not familiar with drinking ginger drinks--this one has some serious kick to it! However, if you like spicy then you'll love this!

It's the kind of tea you sip while reading a good book. It was not overpowering, which teas that have ginger sometimes can be and it wasn't too sweet either. If you like tea, you should give this one a shot. It's tasty!

review/summary: Powerful Flavor
review/text: I love using fresh ginger and lemon when I cook, so when I saw that there was a ginger and lemon drink I had to try it.  While the flavor was good, it did leave a slight after taste, but not enough to deter me from trying it again.  My only complaint is that I received a sample pack of the Gold Kili drink and it did not have any directions as to how much water to use.  I tend to like most of my foods and drinks very flavorful, so I opted for a regular coffee mug, but found it too strong and ended up pouring it into my largest one.  All in all, I thought this provided a nice change of pace for the basic varieties of teas, coffee and other warm drinks that are on the market today.

review/summary: A bit sweet for me, but convenient
review/text: I make ginger tea all winter long--it is hot, free of caffeine and it's a good anti-inflammatory (or it seems to to me.) I make it fresh by peeling, mashing and steeping fresh gingerroot in hot water, then straining and mixing with a scant tsp of honey. It's good. But it's a bit messy to make so this is a handy way to have ginger tea at work, where I'm not able to cut, mash or strain anything, well, except eye strain.<br /><br />The sweetness comes from dried honey powder. I found it a bit sweet for my tastes, but this is good and better than if sweetened with sugar. I don't make my tea with lemon, so this is a nice change. Some people claim that you can cure nausea with ginger tea, but I have not tested that assumption.

review/summary: Beverage comparison to ginger tea
review/text: I've never had tea before that was in this form. But it really isn't tea. As the name states it is a "beverage" not a tea. It comes in a packet that dissolves in hot water. Gold Kili has a very strong (spicy) ginger flavor. It is difficult to describe taste in writing, but I'll try to be clear that this is a very very strong ginger spice. If you like it very strong, I am sure you mayenjoy this. As a "beverage mix" (in contrast to tea) it does save you having to wait for tea to steep because it dissolves instantly. In addition you don't have to clean up a tea bag. It also has sugar (sucrose) already mixed in.<br /><br />The downside is that if you prefer your drink without sweetener or perhaps with a no calorie sweetener like Truvia, that is not an option here because the honey is already mixed in.

review/summary: Flavorful, but wish it were sugar-free
review/text: This has an intense lemon and ginger taste. Much much more intense than lemon and ginger teas which I am a fan of and drink often. And since I love ginger and lemon flavors, I love this intensity. You can't get it from just the lemon-ginger teas -- and I've tried quite a few brands so I know. That's the good news.<br /><br />The con, for me at least, is that there must be a high calorie count for this as it's loaded with honey and fructose. I would prefer this to be non-sweetened so I could add my own non-calorie sweetener if I want.<br /><br />It's also a little expensive compared to teas, but then the flavor is unique and something that just can't be gotten with a regular tea.<br /><br />I won't hesitate to buy this in the future -- only I will look for a non-sweetened brand/type first.<br /><br />One other thing -- I put way more water into this beverage than they asked for. Maybe about twice as much. And the flavors were still so much more intense than a regular ginger-lemon tea. So feel free to dilute it and I don't think you will be diminishing the experience at all.

There is so much ginger in this that it actually made my tongue burn and I only used a half of packet. I can't imagine the burning sensation if I would of used an entire packet of this stuff.  It also leaves a nasty bitter aftertaste in my mouth. I took one sip of this and that is all I could take of it. I wanted to like this drink but it's just not for me.<br /><br />The only good things I can say about Gold Kili beverage is that it's an instant drink and it mixes up really well in your glass.

review/summary: pleasant dehydrated ginger powder
review/text: This is a dehydrated ginger drink, it is barely sweet and they ginger while strong is not overpoweing.  The Lemon is clearly pleasant but not really sour.  It is considerably milder than many Chinese Ginger teas, and more soothing than stimulating.<br /><br />Personally I like much stronger products, and I have always felt lemon was not a particularly good accompaniment for ginger.  In general this is pretty weak beer by my standars though the aftertaste is quite pleasant.  I am actually prone to hypotension (ie. low blood pressure) and like to drink ginger drinks to raise it when I am feeling faint, this was not very effective for this purpose, but it is probably also safer for those who don't want their blood pressure raised.

review/summary: GINGER TEA, and ginger stir fry starter
review/text: I love Ginger tea, the hot and pungent taste, sometimes mixed with mint, or lemon. I used to buy Ginger tea bags, but recently switched to Ginger tea "concintrate" that appears to be ginger jam, which you add to hot water. Its not very economical, and of course, you cant pack it for lunch, or take it from the house. (cos it comes in a glass jar you keep in the fridge.) GOLD KILI ginger tea, solves those problems of cost and portability. The 2oz aluminum bag contains freeze dried ginger lemon tea. However, add the WHOLE bag to a cup of tea, and you'll be overwhelmed. One of those 2oz bags, makes a small teapot of hot tea. Short of using fresh ginger, slicing it and boiling it, this tea is the best. The lemon overtone is mild, conplimenting the ginger, not clouding it. For a sore throat, take this concintrate, add it to pure honey, and take by the teaspoon every hour. Also, for fast ginger stir fry, use a packet of this Ginger honey tea, add it to your stir fried veggies and tofu, along with some soy sauce, and you have a good chinese stir fry sauce. Ginger is good for nausea when traveling. If you carry a pouch of this freeze dried tea in your wallet or purse during cold season, you can treat the first signs of flu, ie the nausea, sore throat, or stuffy nose, as soon as it starts. For a stuffy nose, this is good tea, when mixed with some peppermint tea. (Or, try using a peppermint candy cane, as a hot tea swizzel stick.) I really enjoy GOLD KILI INSTANT GINGER LEMON tea for its intense taste, and convenience. The consintrate is sugar free, so dont forget the honey.

review/summary: Perfect for Winter Colds
review/text: If you don't like ginger, you're not going to like Gold Kili's Ginger and Lemon beverage. The ginger is very strong, bites the tongue a bit, but the lemon is not as strong and while I noticed it, ginger is definitely the frontrunner here.<br /><br />Inside the packet is enough powder mix to fill my 14-ounce mug. I specifically used the larger mug because most packet drinks to me are overly sweet. I don't like a lot of sugar. Instructions are easy, simply pour the mix into your cup, add boiling water, and stir. It's that easy and the mix dissolved quickly. I saw some ginger grounds, but as I love ginger, that definitely wasn't an issue with me.<br /><br />It tastes incredible. Very strong ginger as mentioned earlier, and not a fake ginger, this seems more like dehydrated ginger ground into a course powder. The sugar level was still a little sweet for my tastes, but I think using the larger cup was definitely worthwhile in my case.<br /><br />I happen to have a cold. It's not bad, but annoying nonetheless. After finishing my cup of ginger and lemon beverage, my nose felt a little less clogged, so the ginger aroma and steam obviously helped. Next time though, and I definitely will be buying this mix, I think I'd make it and then chill it for a refreshing summer drink.

review/summary: The taste doesn't do it for me....
review/text: I still think that Vine food reviews should include more than one small sample, because you only get a gutcheck reaction and not all products are viable to that method.  This one is not, I did a lot of juicing the month of January and used real ginger root.  It tended to go well with apple and pears, but not with orange, lemons or limes.  Lemons are generally mixable with most things, but I don't like them with ginger, I think ginger is more of a sweet enhancer than something that works with sour.  This was barely drinkable hot, and given the taste it would have felt better if it were caffinated.  Like coffee, maybe if I'd tried a dozen or so, I'd have developed a taste for it, but at first blush, yuk, enough said.

review/summary: Intense Ginger flavor! Better than I expected.
review/text: I expected this to taste like other ginger teas I have had with a dried, muddled ginger taste.  When I poured the granules into the hot water and they fizzed and turned the water brown, my first thought was "disgusting".  It made the water look like soapy, dirty dishwater.  I sucked it up and took a sip.  Wow, it tastes like fresh ginger!  I was pleasantly surprised.  Now if you don't like the zing and burn of fresh ginger, you won't like this tea.  It does burn a little but I like that.  The ginger flavor does overpower the lemon but again, I love ginger so it didn't bother me.<br /><br />Again, if you don't like the strong taste and aroma of fresh ginger, avoid this drink. But if you love it like I do, enjoy.

review/text: The tea is in a packet of granules.  It is for mixing with hot water to make an 8 oz portion of tea.  The taste is strongly of ginger with light hint of lemon.  If you love ginger, this is something you will probably like.  It is soothing and has a nice kick of spiciness and a goodly amount of heat.  The product in the form of granules isn't the most attractive format.  It looks very artificial although the taste isn't artificial.  The resulting tea is a muddy brown, very unattractive.  Had it been clear, it would work a lot better as a more pleasing to look at product.  The ginger flavor is good and natural.  It will appeal to those looking for a good ginger taste.

I was very excited to try this product but it failed.<br />The aroma is very strong to begin with and it can be a turn off to some people.<br />The beverage itself was strange.  When you take a sip, you immediately get a very very strong taste of ginger, and it's a biting ginger. Then it diminishes very quickly but there is a great afterbite or aftertaste.  Actually the aftertaste is better than the first taste.  I just found it too incosistent a flavor.<br />It's a great idea but I really think they need to go back and rework the ginger aspect of it.  As for the lemon...what lemon flavor?  Didnt' taste any.<br />I dont' think many people would like this product unless maybe if you mixed it with rum or something.

review/text: There is no question that when it comes down to herbal drinks, they can be either good or lack of taste. For Gold Kili All Instant Ginger & Lemon beverage, they made a ginger all the way drink. The smell of the drink isn't bad, but yet the taste is definitely awful. It feels and tastes like you are eating a giant piece of ginger root from the supermarket produce aisle. Sadly, you not only get that taste, but you don't taste enough of the lemon essence inside that said it was suppose to be mixed within the drink. Overall, the next time I taste a ginger and lemon drink, there could be a bit better of a mix than all ginger. For that, I would rather taste a sip of ginger ale.<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Taste: C-<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2-

review/text: I'm not a huge ginger fan, but I have had a lot of ginger tea and the like lately because of a pregnancy (its supposed to ease an upset stomach). This stuff I would not reach for again. In fact, I might not even finish the cup in front of me. It's really....bitter? No, not even that. There's that weird sort of tang ginger has, and this has it big-time, even though I actually watered it down more than I should have (really, it's about 1 packet to 1 measured cup of water). I really only taste the lemon as an aftertaste.<br /><br />Also, the actual stuff is a bit weird. If you're used to the now common little packets of powder you add to a bottle of water, this is WAY more powder to mix in. The packet is about the size of a large teabag, but full. It's also a different consistency...almost looks like small betta fish food. It also smells weird to me.<br /><br />In short, if you want a ginger-lemon hot drink, there are many better alternatives in my opinion.

review/text: This product is very strong, very pungent. I love strong ginger flavor, but this was way beyond my tolerance.  It literally felt like my mouth was burning.  I diluted it in 12 oz of water but it was still unpleasant. Finally I decided to add it to 8 oz of green tea as a flavoring, and it made a delicious 20 oz mug.  I would buy this only as a flavoring for a cup of regular hot tea, which was quite delicious that way.

review/summary: Good if a bit strong
review/text: I really enjoyed this tea, and it was perfect on a cold day.<br /><br />Originally, I was surpised that the contents were like powder version as opposed to tea bags.<br /><br />However, one little packet goes a long way. I ended up splitting one packet into 4 mugs of usage and it ended being perfect. A great lemony taste w/ a huge bite of ginger aftertaste. Even diluted to 4 mugs, it was still a bit strong. I think if it was 1 packet for one cup, the taste would be a bit too powerful.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the diluted version quite a bit and would greatly recommend this product.

review/summary: Sample Too Small for An Accurate Judgment
review/text: An "All-Natural" instant ginger and lemon beverage sounds good, as long as it has the "WOW Factor" that makes us keep wanting to buy. As the sample size I received did not allow me to make a more informed judgement, it had to have an immediate WOW Factor, which it did not. Perhaps if I had received a larger sample, the opinion expressed here might have been different. What I can say is that those who already love this sort of beverage will buy more while those unacquainted with it may just stay so until a better review comes their way.

review/text: I sent for this product on a whim. I used half a packet in warm water just to see what it tasted like. The ginger imparts a strong bitter flavor so I wouldn't use this unless I needed to.

I had even taken an acid reducer with mild results before I remembered to try the Gold Kili. It relieved all symptoms! I need to order more to keep on hand.

review/summary: A bit strong but delicious
review/text: When I first opened this foil pack that I received to review from Amazon I thought  it was awful because it did not have a very pleasant odor.<br />I did promise to review these so I boiled some water and took down a large cup.  It states you need to use 250 mil. (i/2 cup)boiling water  and I did just that.<br />I poured the proper amount of water and then sprinkled in the instant Ginger tea.  Immediately the scent of Ginger filled the air and I was taken away, I new this was going to be good, but, it is too strong for my taste so I added another 1/4 cup or more.  I love Ginger tea, I even grow my own ginger in the summer but his is entirely too strong for me.  It burned my mouth and throat.  Yes Ginger should have a nice bite to it but this was all too much.  I did, however, use it all anyway since I do not like waste even if it is free.<br />I took a bag of herbal tea and put it in the cup and steeped that a bit and it was wonderful.  the flavor of the Ginger when it was tamed by the herbal tea became what I wished for in the first place.  I may just buy and use it sparingly in my herbal tea as an added unique flavor.  If you are a Ginger tea fan then I am sure you will love this.

review/summary: Works nicely for a sore throat, has a strong ginger taste
review/text: This tea reminds me of similar blends I used to get in Chinatown.  They are great for cold and flu season.  I use ginger lemon herbal tea when my throat is sore.  This was a good drink, it dissolved into hot water easily.  There were no ingredients listed on the pack, but it was sweetened and that tasted non-artificial.  I am not sure what "Honey (Fructose, Glucose and Sucrose)"  is because it seems to be four things, but maybe that is one of those lost in translation things.  I do like this drink and would buy something similar if I wanted something pre-sweetened.  I am not sure about the calorie content in this tea because I received one bag to sample and not a box, which would have had a nutritional guide on it.  It tastes as good as Stash's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG87Q">Stash Premium Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, which I normally drink for my throat.  The ginger is pretty strong with the lemon adding just the right amount of sour.  I am not really sure why this tea is getting such low marks, I liked it a lot.  I wish I had more than one bag to sample.  I would have loved to had tried this with matcha or in a recipe of some kind.  I should note I had this hot, I didn't know you could serve it cold.  I don't have any more bags to try that, but would like to.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a ginger fan, you'll love this.  If you don't like strong ginger, you should probably buy a more mild tisane.  I would say the Stash tea above, though it does have soy in it.  I tend to prefer this tea over that because it doesn't have soy in it.  I find most Yogi tea to be very mild on the ginger side but it seems a lot of people like them.  I would prefer a real ginger taste and maybe people aren't used to real ginger.  It's almost a mediation type of drink, used to ease stomach problems and for all around well being.  I feel the difference after I drink a tisane like this or eat ginger root.  It's energizing.  I do think, however and this is a minor thing, that any chemical taste people are getting is probably from the "Honey (Fructose, Glucose and Sucrose)", whatever that is and not the lemon itself.  It's probably an aftertaste from the sweetener.  I wish they sold a non-sweetened version of this so I could compare.

review/text: We don't need to be convinced about the combined, ailment-fighting power of lemon and ginger.  We often make our own home-made brew of water, lots of lemon juice, fresh ginger and honey to soothe everything from congestion and coughs to indigestion and nausea.<br /><br />So Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix seemed to be a good thing to keep in the pantry if you didn't have all of the above ingredients on hand.<br /><br />Made from real ginger and honey, along with a natural lemon flavor, the crystals dissolved very quickly in water.<br /><br />But when it came to drinking the stuff--the ginger was way too overpowering.  I really like ginger and found it far too strong.  It felt like like a rake scraping the back of my throat, and then it left a slightly bitter after-taste.  They say you can adjust the taste by adding less of the packet powder next time, but it seems like a wasteful fuss to us.<br /><br />Next time I'll just make sure to stock extra lemons and ginger in the fridge.

I enjoy all of the flavors on their own and have had them combined in other drinks, but this was just wrong.  The flavors were there.  They were intense.  I am not afraid of intense, but they were just off.  It seemed like a drink made from cheap spices that had expired or turned rancid.  First I tried it hot because I am a huge fan of teas.  This is not a tea, so I decided to give it a second chance after it cooled.  I didn't like it either way.  The ginger seemed dusty and old and the lemon was toned down.  It was also very strong and the flavors were off.  It may have been better if it were a backdrop flavor in an actual tea.  I would never purchase this or recommend it to anyone else.

review/summary: gold kili Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage MIx
review/text: This beverage mix has a VERY strong Ginger flavor and not much lemon at all. There was not a list of ingredients on the sample packet, but it is supposed to be top grade ginger and honey. I am assuming that the honey made it sweet and that an artificial sweetener was not added. If you are going to use it as just a drink, you might try using a half of a packet, but you could also add a whole one to a pitcher of ice tea and still have a nice ginger flavor. I would think that it would also be great to clear out your sinuses. Since many people use ginger for an upset stomach or an aid to digestion, it would be great to make a drink for that purpose. It comes in 6.72 ounce boxes and a pack of 6 for $22.69 on Amazon. I gave it a four star, as it may be too strong for people who do not particularly care for the strong ginger flavor.

review/summary: For Serious Ginger Lovers
review/text: I love ginger and this mix has a real ginger bite to it. Just as some people like spicy hot wings, some of us prefer it when we can feel the ginger.  This mix doesn't wimp out on flavor and has a good blend of honey sweetener and lemon as well.  One packet mixed with hot water makes an 8-ounce cup of a non-caffeinated hot beverage so it would be convenient to pack in your purse or backpack.  The ginger is very, very strong so if you prefer a milder ginger flavor you may want to use less than the full packet; you'll need to experiment.  If you prefer your hot drinks to be bland and innocuous, then this product probably isn't for you.  But, if you're serious about your ginger, you'll enjoy this blend.

review/summary: Really "Good"
review/text: I would say that this drink mix is the next best thing than real ginger tea.  When I received this product, I happened to have a cold.  I learned, from my years of living in the Hawaiian islands, that ginger is the best thing to sweat a flu or cold out.<br />Anyway, I tried this drink and it was really effective.  I thought the taste was a bit off, but than again, it is an instant mix.<br /><br />All in all, if I didn't have fresh ginger root on hand, I would instantly grab for one of these packets in a pinch.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br />RLM

review/summary: If you love ginger, you'll love this.
review/text: If Jamaican ginger beer is too strong for you, then this will not be your cup of tea, but if ginger is one of your favorites, and the stronger, the better, then you are in luck. Besides giving you that real ginger bite, it has lemon and sugar in a little packet that dissolves well in hot water. For a cough, a sore throat or even a queasy stomach, it will most likely make things better, but watch out for the burn on that sore throat as it cleans out all the crud! This is the kind of thing I like to keep on hand for times when I'm not feeling well or when I just want to treat myself to something easy, sweet, spicy and flavorful.

review/summary: Didn't tickle my taste buds
review/text: Although touted as an all natural beverage, it did not taste that way. I caught what seemed a taste of an artificial sweetener. The maker says it is sweetened by honey, glucose and sucrose. Not anything artificial there. My tongue must have misled me.<br /><br />It matters little, though, since I did not like the taste. I'm fond of ginger, of honey, and of lemon in hot drinks. So I thought this one would tickle my taste buds. But no.

review/summary: It packs a Zingy taste!
review/text: Being a longtime tea drinker, I was surprised that I found this as good as I did.  The surprise is this zingy aftertaste.  I like it best piping hot.  You don't have to use an entire packet per cup.....you can make it milder if you want.  It is not in a loose tea form, but rather it is a mix that you dissolve as a solution.  Remember it is pretty powerful if you drink it as directed.

review/summary: Ginger Snap
review/text: When I received this, I wanted to look at the ingredients.  They're not listed on the packet, so I went to the company's website.  The ingredients are ginger, glucose, sucrose, honey, fructose, and natural lemon flavor.<br /><br />I was crestfallen.  With the exception of hot chocolate or a chai latte, I don't like sweetened drinks at all.  I love sweet foods, but not sweet beverages.  Once, in a restaurant, I was served sweetened ice tea.  I didn't know it had sugar in it, and I nearly spit it out on the table.  In a word, yuck!  So I wasn't looking forward to trying this.<br /><br />But I did, after dinner.  I heated some water and stirred in the mix.  It was fabulous!  Despite all the sugar it wasn't cloyingly sweet, and the ginger left a warm, tingly aftertaste.  It was so delectable, I barely restrained myself from drinking it all up.  I wanted to see what it tasted like cold, so I grudgingly put the remainder in the fridge.  Cold, I still got the gingery-ness, but the beverage tasted flat.  I don't recommend it cold.<br /><br />It's hard to believe I enjoyed a sweetened, instant hot drink, but I surely did.  If you enjoy sweet and spicy hot beverages, you'll like it too.

review/summary: Spicy Ginger Lemon Drink
review/text: If you don't like your ginger strong, you won't like this drink.  However, if you want to a spicy-sweet concoction to take the edge off a cold or the cold, this brew will do the trick.  The freeze-dried combination of ginger, lemon and honey dissolves quickly in hot water.  The result is not for the tame of tongue.  It is quite spicy, and produces a sharp edge in your throat.  On a cold day, it warms your inside.

review/text: Overall, this product was decent.  In some respects, it was reminiscent of mixing up a packet of Theraflu, where the taste is a bit strong and the flavor is all right but you nevertheless feel comforted by the fact that you've a hot, aromatic beverage in your hands.  A serviceable instant drink that might be preferred by those with a strong penchant for ginger.

Overall, this lemon/ginger drink was a nice refreshening pick-me-up at the end of a long day.

review/summary: Gingery Punch Would Have Benefitted From Less Lemon
review/text: While I like the gingery punch of this instant beverage, I did not care for the lemon.  It tasted like someone dropped a lemon drop in it.  Yes, there was lemon but it tasted fake and cloyingly sweet.  I enjoyed the initial sips but as I got to the bottom the sweetness and the fakey lemon flavor overwhelmed.  The packet dissolved nicely and there was not a pile of residue in the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />I think this is  a nice substitute for regular tea and is probably great if you are suffering from a cold. It is warming but I found the lemon undertones off putting.

review/text: Gold Kili Ginger & Lemon makes a very strong delicious beverage. If you love Ginger - you will adore Gold Kili.<br /><br />This morning, I had a dizzy/nauseous spell.  (Winter bug?)  I mixed one package and BAM all better : )  I'm surprised at how well and quickly it worked.<br /><br />The only issue I have with it, is the amount of sugar.  If it had less sugar I'd drink at least one a day.  It would be a great picker-upper for an afternoon slump.<br /><br />Gold Kili Ginger & Lemon is SO Good,  I might try to figure out how to incorporate it into my diet.

review/summary: Pleasant, warming drink with a unique flavor.
review/text: I like hot drinks like coffee & tea, and I like the flavors of lemon and ginger.<br /><br />This drink has a pleasant aroma and a spicy/sweet flavor. The ginger flavor is very strong -- almost like eating a Ginger flavored Altoid. The ginger's spicy flavor lingers in the mouth for a while after each sip.<br /><br />This drink is great for cold days and I bet it'd be super soothing if you had a cold or a sore throat. I may pick some more of this up if I see it at the grocery store.

review/summary: Instant Ginger Lemon beverage is ok
review/text: This little package smells really good of ginger when I opened it. It was easy to rip open. The directions were simple, to empty contents and add hot water and stir. It says 250ml of water but it would have been nice if it also said ounces, as I am not used to measuring liquids in milliliters.<br /><br />The little crystals/powder of drink mix dissolved in the hot water well and had a wonderful aroma of ginger float up.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting the drink to be quite so sweet. The second ingredient is honey and it is very strong. I am not a huge fan of sweet drinks and the sweetness was more than I'd like.<br /><br />Overall it's not a bad drink and if you have an upset stomach, ginger and honey are very good for that. The lemon is subtle but it is there and noticeable. If I liked sweeter drinks I'd probably have liked it more.

review/summary: Didn't like it
review/text: When I selected this via Vine, I knew that it'd have a strong ginger taste to it. Whenever you add ginger to something and heat it up, ginger is going to be something that you can easily taste. I just wasn't expecting it to be this gingery.<br /><br />This smelled good when I first mixed it (although it looked like brown water), but it's the taste that killed me. This was pretty spicy and the ginger taste was incredibly strong. I couldn't taste the lemon in this at all, the ginger taste was so overwhelmingly strong. The comparisons of this to a medicine are pretty apt. It reminds me of some of the cold medicines that I'll add to hot water whenever I get a runny nose. Not exactly a taste that I'm eager to drink on a regular basis.<br /><br />I drank a little of it, but I ended up having to dump it out. Even when considering that ginger is a miraculous plant, I still wouldn't buy this even as an occasional pick me up. I can see drinking it for a cold since it'd definitely clean your sinuses out, but it's just too strong of a drink for me. I'd much rather go for some fresher ginger than this. I'm not sure that I'd drink this to help with nausea either, to be honest. (Ginger is AWESOME for upset tummies.) It's just too strong, although if this is at the store next time I get nauseous, I might give it a try.<br /><br />Overall this is probably something best suited to hard core ginger enthusiasts rather than those who just like an occasional ginger with their sushi and drink tons of ginger ale.

review/text: If you enjoy fresh ginger, you will enjoy this tea.  It is probably very good for a cold or sore throat, as well as just a refreshing drink.<br /><br />Personally, I found that it was much too strong for me.  It left my mouth feeling as though I had eaten a piece of fresh ginger.  I like ginger cookies and gingerbread, but this was too much for me.  I wouldn't have known that there was lemon in the tea if it hadn't been listed.<br /><br />It's easy to fix, and is just right in sweetness.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: I really had high hopes for this ginger and lemon drink. I've got digestive issues and thought it great there there is something more natural out there than pills and might taste better than a ginger herbal tea. It's not really marketed for that, but why not, it's ginger.<br /><br />That first sip was shocking, and not in a good way. The taste is incredibly strong and left a burning feeling on both my tongue and back of my throat for a couple of minutes each time I took a sip even after it had cooled down quite a bit. Yes I did try a number of sips but I can't say that I developed an appreciation for it. Nor could I finish it.<br /><br />Anyone who actually drinks real ginger tea will actually find more enjoyment in this product.  Unfortunately, I drink too much sweet stuff and this appears to be an acquired taste.<br /><br />It is packaged for convenience.  Instead of a tea bag, you get tea bag-sized packets with a powered mixture.  No tea bags to dispose of.

review/summary: High Priced
review/text: The crystalized ginger drink tastes much the same as other such drinks readily available at many Asian markets at half the price. I see other reviewers complained about after taste and it being too strong. I haven't run across a ginger drink that is too strong, so maybe it is just me but this one is relatively mild. At first, I didn't taste anything bad in the after taste but I wrote the review before finishing the drink... then went back to revise. Yes, not as good as I thought after the flavor lingers. It is a mediocre product at an premium price.

review/summary: Not *my* cup of "tea" but it was easy to make
review/text: I know this drink doesn't contain tea, but it does put me in the mind of something one might drink as a substitute for a cup of hot tea.  Personally, I found the ginger flavor way too strong for my liking.  The lemon flavor was so subtle it seemed like somewhat of an afterthought.  I only deducted one star because of the strong, almost overpowering ginger taste.  Maybe one of the other flavors would be more up my alley.<br /><br />BUT, I did go ahead and give the product four stars because it was extremely easy to prepare (just open the packet and dissolve the contents into 1 cup of hot water) and the crystals dissolved well.  I might try another flavor.

review/summary: Nasty!
review/text: I received a single serving packet of this item for review. Frankly, it was nasty. I prepared it according to the instructions on the product (add 1 cup of hot water, stir and serve instantly). Yuck. Considering that it was supposed to taste like ginger, honey and perhaps a little lemon flavor - I was not pleased. Then I tried putting it over ice and yes, adding a little sugar. No improvement. I can't see recommending the beverage, buying this or encouraging others to use it despite the medicinal qualities of ginger for motion sickness or the nausea of pregnancy, etc. It did absolutely nothing for my digestion, either.<br /><br />I am sure whether or not you like this will be wholly a matter of personal taste. It was not for me!

review/text: I don't usually use products like this--I just stick to peppermint or ginger tea or cold water. But I knew ginger is supposed to be good for nausea, so I waited until I had a migraine (mine usually involve nausea) to try it. I liked the taste, it mixed well, and didn't leave an aftertaste. It tasted like a natural, simple product. I do believe it helped somewhat with the nausea, too.The nausea didn't clear immediately, but it only lasted for a half hour after I drank the beverage. I will take it on my next trip to Hawaii and try it very cold for seasickness. (The ginger/lemon combination might not be for everyone, but I liked it!)

review/summary: Not My Cup of Ginger Flavored Instant Beverage
review/text: I really like herbal teas, I often enjoy a cu or two of cider, and like to use ginger in various recipes. So I was fully expecting to enjoy this ginger-flavored beverage. However, it's incredibly strong and pungent taste really hit me for the first sip, and I literally recoiled. A friend of mine also tried it and she had pretty much the same reaction with just barely tasting a drop of it. I didn't dare to offer it to my wife, as she is a "supertaster," and would probably have even more adverse reaction than I. In a nutshell, this is definitely not a beverage for everyone. If you are already familiar with ginger-lemon drinks, then you might appreciate it, but I would advise everyone else to proceed at their own risk.

review/summary: A bit sweeter than I like, but otherwise excellent
review/text: I am a big fan of ginger - especially when it has a strong bite and lingering afterburn. The Gold Kili Ginger and Lemon mix has lots of both, plus lemon's tang. I loved the overall flavor, but wish it was just a bit less sweet.  Then again, I seem to prefer less sweetness than most Americans, at least judging from what's on the market.<br /><br />I mixed the packet into 8oz of hot water and it was a delight to drink. I bought some more... Now that it has arrived, I can see the ingredients on the box: Ginger, Honey and "Natural Lemon Flavor".  That's it. Confusingly, the label actually says "Honey (glucose, sucrose, fructose)" which seems to have upset some on the Facebook page for this product. As the company representative said, those are components of honey, which is true. There is about a tablespoon's worth of honey in each packet.

Some might prefer ginger tea so they could control the sweetness level themselves, but it wasn't too sweet as is. Good with a little milk too. Tasted good cold and hot. Since many of the reviews did give the drink a poor rating, I suggest looking at a few reviews to better know if it would appeal to someone new to the drink.

review/text: It is a raw, cold day in Michigan today, the perfect time to try the Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Beverage. My first concern was that the directions are in ml instead of oz...so there had to be a math lesson before I could make the drink. That accomplished the steamy drink smelled so delicious. I was sure it would taste as good as it smelled and never even thought about adding a sweetner. The first sip was awful....it didn't taste at all lemony like it smelled. I can't identify the taste but do know my mouth and throat felt an unpleasant,almost stinging sensation. So, I added some sugar. The second and third sip were slightly better, but the stinging sensation was still there and the aftertaste did not go away quickly. The rest of the drink went down the sink drain....it was definitely not my cup of "tea".

review/summary: Nice gingery bite - Mmmm! Good with a bit of tequila!
review/text: Nice, gingery bite kind of like you get with strong ginger cookies. VERY sweet beverage. This is worth trying if you like pungent, aromatic, tangy, bitey, spicy, sweet beverages (I do). The ginger flavor seems to overwhelm the lemon flavor. I don't drink ginger drinks, but enjoy the pickled ginger you get with some dishes at Japanese restaurants.<br /><br />I poured this into a coffee mug with hot water microwaved for two and one half minutes (shy of boiling). My son (post teenager, just a man) sipped it and said, "blechhh." My wife and I (over 50 each) sipped it and said, "Hmmm ... this would be nice on a cold day."<br /><br />I'm sipping it  now, enjoying it quite nicely as I write this review. I think you'll have to try it to see if you'll like it. Recommended for people who like ginger who personally may not like it, but worth trying. If you're not into pungent and tangy beverages, consider passing.<br /><br />FAST UPDATE: Mmmmm ... kind of nice with an ounce of tequila!
