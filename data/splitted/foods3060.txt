review/summary: Delicious Latte & More
review/text: I discovered this delicious flavor during a visit to my local Joe Muggs Cafe - and I was instantly hooked. So rich, thick & the flavor lasts until the last sip. I was thrilled to find this product, here on Amazon, and immediately placed my order.<br />Which leads me to the second part of this review - that of Beverage Gourmet...reliable, dependable, the package arrived on time as promised and even though the pump was missing from my order - I simply sent through the "formatted problem with this order" section available here at Amazon and within an hour or so received a very courteous, apologetic reply. BG shipped the missing portion of my original order via UPS and it arrived within 48 hours. I couldn't be happier with the product, the service and the professional, courteous manner that I was greeted with and the manner in which my issues were resolved should be held out as 'the' example of top notch customer service.

review/summary: The most delicious Latte!
review/text: This sauce is the only one anyone should ever use.  It has a real pumpkin pie taste.  The thick sauce is perfect for making a great Latte.  If you like the drinks you get at Starbucks during the holidays, get this!  I was not sure I would get my money's worth.  But yes!  This is outstanding and people cannot believe how great it tastes when I make them take a sip.  Don't try other brands, and whatever you do, don't use the syrup that calls itself "pumpkin".  This this sauce is the one you want for making the drinks that truly taste like a pumpkin pie.  So rich, and yum!  Well worth the dough!

review/summary: Really bad...unless you like drinking perfume or cologne....
review/text: I ordered this product last year and it was very good. This year when I received, it tasted different in a BAD way. Da Vinci must have changed their recipe since last year. Now it has an artificial after taste...like when you spray perfume or cologne and it gets in your mouth. Has a perfume taste and even a perfume like smell. Revised recipe must contain too much of the aromatic spices and/or artificial spices. To Marketing and Research people at Da Vinci....If it ain't broken, don't fix it....a lesson Starbucks needs to learn. I will NEVER buy this product again. I have more than 3/4 of a container left which will be thrown out.....

review/summary: This flavor completely saved my Sodastream experience and I'm so happy it did
review/text: I bought the Sodastream thinking that it would be the most brilliant thing ever. And then I tried the syrup flavors. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. I mean, I regularly bought a flavored sparkling water drink that had zero calories and tasted amazing (the Sparkling ICE brand), so how difficult was it to put that in a syrup to add to carbonated water myself?<br /><br />This Diet Cranberry-Raspberry is as close as I've found to a great tasting, calorie-free, flavored sparkling water that I can make to order fresh at home. I always have at least three bottles of this on hand at a time for those moments when regular water just isn't enough and I'm craving something sweet with carbonation.<br /><br />There are so many ways to drink this as well. I like to mix natural fruit juice with carbonated water and a tiny bit of this to help keep it from tasting watered down. Even putting half the amount of syrup (or less!) than is called for is really good for that light, refreshing sort of taste. I've even added it to the coke mix when that was decidedly bad in an attempt at salvaging it and surprise, surprise. It was SO much better.<br /><br />This flavor completely saved my sodastream experience and I am so happy it did.

review/summary: Tasty, not overpowering flavor or sweetness
review/text: I am relatively new to Sodastream.  I tried the mix sampler that was sent with the machine and only really liked the diet pink grapefruit syrup.  Now I can say that the Diet Cranberry-Raspberry flavor is a definite keeper!  The flavor and sweetness are not nearly so strong as the pink grapefruit, which makes it more refreshing.  Those who are looking for a sweet, strongly-flavored beverage may not like this one (truthfully, it does not taste strongly of either cranberry or raspberry), or might want to double up on the syrup.  I'm the sort that enjoys soda water with a wedge of lime, so "less is more" for me.

review/summary: Honey Nut Cheerios #1 for sure
review/text: Alright, I'll preface by saying that I have not had the pricing or expiration (not that I would notice) issues that some of the other reviewers have faced.  The humanity.  I get them every 3 months and the price has always been between 6.50 and 8.50.  This is a tremendous bargain.  One of these boxes at Duane Reade costs $4.99+.  I would probably get it delivered more than once every 3 months if I ate breakfast more.<br /><br />This is by far my favorite cereal, and while I may sound like a child, I'm 27.  Since you're curious, the other members of the Cereal Rushmore are:<br />Cinnamon Toast Crunch<br />Frosted Flakes<br />Corn Pops<br />Honorable Mention: Lucky Charms<br /><br />Boom, done.<br /><br />Update 9/20/12: Now that they got rid of the 3pack, and replaced it with the 4pack, they also jacked the price.  S+S is $18 currently ($4.25 per box).  While I will still buy them, the savings is noticeably less.  Maybe the other reviewers were right all along.

review/text: Honey Nut is my favorite flavor of Cheerios, and while I will do generic of a lot of things, I have got to have brand name Cheerios.  They're just so much better than the off-brands.  However, the price on this item is often outrageously high.  I've seen it over $25, today's price is about $18... I've been watching this for about 10 days, and I have never seen it the same price two days in a row.  I managed to score mine at about $7 last week, but I'm thinking I just got lucky.  Definitely not a better value than just getting them at Sam's or using a coupon and buying them at the grocery store.  Lame.

review/text: I don't eat cereal everyday, but when I do, I like to eat Cheerios. There really isn't anything bad I can say about original Cheerios, but I do prefer Honey Nut Cheerios if I have the option. Also, I am not the biggest honey lover, but the taste in this cereal is not overpowering; it is just right. I really think this is one the best classic cereals on the market. They are fairly healthy, especially since General Mills has started to make all of their cereals with whole grains. These are good for lowering your cholesterol and maintaining a good diet. The amazon price is cheaper than my local store, even without the subscribe and save option. So, I recommend :-)<br /><br />Note: The amazon.com seller has the best price. Some other sellers have it for higher prices on amazon, but you probably wont be getting such a good deal. Enjoy.

review/text: This is one of the healthier cereals you can buy. I wouldn't say it is life changing, but as far as processed grain cereals go this one is both tasty and lower in sugar with some natural fiber. Though the price is similar to what you can get at your local grocery store, you can't beat the front door delivery. If you haven't tried it before, it is definitely a great way to start of your day.<br />Just to make things fair, my personal preference is frosted mini-wheats, but that is to grainy tasting for many people. This product here is much easier to eat and sweeter tasting.

review/text: It's honey nut Cheerios. Sweet, but not too sweet. This is the type of cereal you can eat with milk or just by itself. Your fingers won't get messy like when you eat cereals with marshmallows and it's easy to grab. All around good stuff.<br /><br /> You can sometimes find it cheaper at the store and certain boxes have promotions where you can get stuff. However having it delivered to your door can be more convenient, especially if you don't have a car or the time to buy groceries.

They were fresh, came in a shrink-wrap pack of 3, and it was a good deal cheaper than going to a local grocery store in Jersey City. I will definitely be making this purchase again.

review/text: I grew up on Cheerios.  We did not have all the sugary sweet cereals we have today and that was fine. Then Honey Nut Cheerios came along.  I thought they were too sweet in the beginning.  I used to mix them 1/2 &  1/2.  That made them sweet enough for me.<br /><br />I do enjoy them right out of the box, like candy.  It helps with my craving for chocolate.  I always have a box of cheerios in my house to enjoy for breakfast or a snack.

review/text: I love cereal and eat a lot of it. I'm not a fan of regular Cheerios as I think the flavor is very bland and cardboard like. And it's not that sweet and I like at least a little sweetness in my cereals. Honey Nut Cheerios is better because it is sweeter and has a little more flavor. Still it's not one of my favorites and I don't buy it that often.

It worked out great for a few months and then amazon changed their pricing and it went from ~$7.00/3 boxes to ~$11.00.  I don't know how they can justify a price hike of $4.00 in one month.  I have canceled this subscribe and save option ... along with a couple others.  A reminder to whomever reads this -- when they send you an email reminding you of an order coming soon --pay attention to the previous and the current pricing.

review/summary: Product likely contains GMO corn
review/text: This used to be one of my favorite breakfast cereals, until I learned about GMOs (genetically modified organisms).  Honey Nut Cheerios contains "modified corn" as the second ingredient, and since they do not specify "organic" or "non-GMO", and corn is one of the most genetically modified crops in our country, there is a high probability this cereal contains GMOs.  We typically only trust companies who specify on the packaging that they source non-gmo ingredients or have a company statement that they do not use GMOs, such as Barbara's Bakery and Annie's.  Amazon has an incredible selection of organic and/or non-GMO cereals and breakfast products!  [...]

review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: VERY GOOD TASTING "REAL BREWER'S YEAST" -- NOTHING ADDED<br /><br />This "Genuine Brewer's Yeast" powder tastes very good for real Brewers Yeast. Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

review/summary: B Vitamin Bonanza
review/text: I first encountered brewers yeast when pregnant.  It kept coming up again and again as the perfect food based nutritional additive.  Since it is food based and not a suppliment, it is easily absorbed.  However, it is known for its unpleasent taste.  A serving is two heaping tablespoons, and at first I could not find something to mix it in that I liked well enough, so I gave up on it temporarily.  It kept coming up in my researches for a healthy pregnancy, and so returned to it and it has remained part of my daily routine.  The mix I found I like quite well is the two heaping tablespoons mixed into about 5oz of Pom pomagranite juice.  This mixture is actually quite pleasent.<br /><br />I have tried a few different brands, and I am fond of Twinlab for the more palitable taste and the balance of the B vitamins.  The "subscribe and save" deal on Amazon puts it at a very good price.

They like the taste of the yeast and regard it as a special treat. The yeast provides them with extra B vitamins.<br /><br />One of the vitamins in the yeast is vitamin B1, thiamine. Many people believe that thiamine repels fleas. This has not been proved. However, since the cats like the yeast, they get in on their food. One 18 ounce bottle seems to last forever. Also, they do not have fleas.

review/summary: Good taste, bad solubility
review/text: I started taking brewers yeast because the large amount of chromium in it is supposed to be very good for your skin, especially if it's acne prone. I've been taking it since the end of January and my skin still breaks out a little bit, but I stopped taking it for a couple of days and my face broke out a lot so I suppose that it is having some sort of an effect. An online review I read said that most people's skin cleared after eight months in an study, so I am staying positive.<br /><br />I started out by taking Swansons' Brewer's Yeast Powder, and mixed it in smoothies and grapefruit juice. I tried mixing it in orange juice, which was pretty bad, and even just having it with water, which was horrible and made me gag. Because I wasn't crazy about the taste, I read some reviews and decided to try this product next. The taste is much better, it is much less noticeable, especially if I add a little bit of peanut butter or grapefruit juice to the smoothies. The taste is also not at all noticeable in warmed apple juice. I don't have the courage to try it in plain water, though.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is that it does not dissolve well. I cannot stir it in any cold liquid without getting clumps (hopeless when stirred with a spoon or knife, somewhat works when stirred with a fork but little clumps remain), I can barely dissolve all of it in warmed liquids, and if I put it first in my blender when I make the smoothies, a lot of it remains at the bottom. In that respect, I liked Swansons' Brewer's Yeast better. This one is a little bit high maintenance because if I want to just have it in grapefruit juice, I have to put it in the blender first and when I make smoothies, I have to make sure that it's one of the last things to go in. I would, however, buy this product again if I can't find a brewers yeast that has the taste of this product with a better solubility.

review/text: this stuff is ok.  I was hoping it was the flakes but it's a very fine powder, like a flour consistency.  Which makes it kinda turn pasty when sprinkled on veggies or sprinkled on popcorn.  The taste isn't bad, not really great either, but not bad.  I think the yeast flakes would be better, more texture.  But since it only comes in the 3 bottle package, I have 3 bottles to get through now before I can buy the flakes!  If you're not sure you'll like it, try to find it in a single bottle first.

review/summary: Love this meal in a bag!
review/text: This was the first time I've tried any of the Frontier Soups (hadn't heard of the brand prior, and was never available at my local supermarket), and I love it! I would have given it six stars, if I could...:)<br /><br />Talk about hearty! This "Ohio Valley Vegetable Soup" blend is all natural, wholesome and quite frankly, chock full of good stuff! I've never seen so many whole veggies in a soup mix before. In the package, you will find dried corn, zucchini, string beans, peas, peppers, celery, carrots, onions, herbs, brown rice and pasta...even a bay leaf; very impressive! To complete the soup, they suggest you add chicken or veggie broth, sugar snap peas, lemon juice and garlic(you may also add chicken or turkey meat, unless you wish to leave it vegetarian). No additional salt is added, so it's very low sodium (20 mg), but you might wish to add a little for flavor. Each bag makes 6-8 servings (approx. 1 cup each).<br /><br />I can easily see keeping this in my cupboard as a "staple"...and I believe you will too once you try it!

review/summary: Outstanding Baklava -- as good as I've had but be prepared for family feuds!
review/text: My husband and I live in a small town and there was a Lebanese doctor who always used to order a tray of Greek/Mediterranean Pastries for Christmas and it was the highlight of the holiday.  Alas, he moved away and no more trays.  We never knew where he ordered the trays from but the next year, the kids (including my husband) really needed a Baklava fix.<br /><br />I decided to try this brand.  Well, it it didn't last long!  Fights broke out, pieces were stolen... it wasn't pretty.  I'm pretty sure even the woman who cleans our house took a piece.<br /><br />The pastry itself is light and flaky but the filling is dripping with honey and filled with nuts.  The taste is wonderful.  They should put a warning label on this stuff that it is addictive and can cause "civil unrest" within the home.<br /><br />Highly recommended -- particularly if you need to add a few pounds and don't have to share!

review/text: Reading reviews for other products, I was worried about the taste of any nettle tea product, but this one has a fresh taste and texture that keeps me interested.  It does smell faintly like beet/spinach greens, but not overwhelmingly so.  The tea is really mild and strangely filling; definitely calming.  I decided to try it for allergies and I notice a better balance in my nose and sinus while drinking it throughout the day - that may be related to the hot water, though.  I like it, it is certified organic and very fresh.  I will order again.

review/text: This coffee gives off great crema and a robust aroma when brewing, but I found the taste the most bitter I've yet had in all the espressos I have bought lately to try out.  It's quite potable with lots of milk and vanilla flavorings, though...but nowhere near as good as my Lavazza.  The bitterness overrides any flavor this coffee may have.  I certainly didn't taste any, and the bitterness lingered in my mouth long after my coffee was done.

review/text: Being a lover of fresh food, I prefer cooking a fresh batch of rice for any meal. But, sometimes I feel lazy or I'm just so f'ing hungry I can't wait 30-40 minutes for the rice cooker. I was skeptical about buying microwaveable rice but Nishiki is a good brand so I gave it shot. Glad I did. It's quick, has just the right portion, and it's actually pretty good. I make sure to always have a pack of these in my pantry.

review/summary: Decent stuff
review/text: Being half jap and having grown up with a rice cooker (the appliance, not my mom), I'm a bit biased.  I used to believe that edible rice was cooked by person.  My opinion on that hasn't changed much over 35 years-look at this like you would at microwaved bacon; not great, but not horrible either.  I can make better rice of the same brand out of my cooker easy, but this stuff is great if you take in the context of having just worked six hours overtime and being too tired to cook.  If you have nori on hand, even better.  Not quite the right texture, but better than uncle ben's and you're full with one serving.  The fat is below the radar but I'm happy with jack's pizza, to put you in an honest taste perspective.  I prefer kukoho rose to nishiki for flavor, but they don't offer a microwave version, and I got tired of finding pests in my bag due to their paper packaging.

As a bachelor , I live life on the go, I have places to be, people to meet, laundry to not do, video games to play.  Often times, I forget to eat, or trying to squeeze in dinner between work and meeting my friends after the gym.  I don't need anything too fancy, but the fact that I can have rice on the go, and throw away the bowl after; its a life saver in so many ways.  Oh and I forgot to mention, this rice tastes AMAZING.  I've done blind tests with friends, and they have no idea that microwavable rice could be so "fresh" and delicious.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!!

review/text: Perfect rice fit for sushi, curry, or simply a compliment to any meal. It doesn't have an odd aftertaste like most microwave rice, and though you may be tempted by the more expensive sorts, this is the only one I have seen that comes out as well as if you cooked it yourself. Don't waste your time with microwave multigrain from the fancy foods section. Walk right down to ethnic foods and pick up several, should you ever need to cook in haste. It's less economic than cooking it yourself, and at an asian food store I've seen it for a buck, while 3 dollars at the supermarket. Amazon in bulk is a good alternative if you have no idea where to drive off to in order to get such a deal. Delicious whether you're into Japanese cooking or just want rice fast.

If you ever make it to Jamaica, be sure to buy plenty of Jablum in the airport's Duty Free stores . . . it is far less expensive, but not necessarily fresher. Also, make sure that the bean quality is #1 (not a problem with Jarblum products, but a concern with other Jamaican "blends" offered in stores and on the Internet). Thank heaven for the Blue Mountains (the "blum" in Jablum)!

One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other "Jamaica grown" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price.

I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)

review/summary: A little disappointed
review/text: This tea is great. I do not consider it the best though.  Actually this Chai is too expensive and will never be as good as NUMI Golden Chai or Seven Spice Chai.
