review/text: Our three dogs love these and in a previous review the price is very good.  I have had a difficult time finding these large bags since our PetSmart in Atlanta stopped carrying them and the cost of a small bag is ridiculous. The added plus is that my order is on auto ship so no need to worry anymore when we are about to run out since we know an order is always on the way.  Thanks for this service Amazon!

review/summary: Beagle Pleasing Yummies!
review/text: I have two Beagles and they LOVE these treats. Keep them in a sealed container or they get hard and stale quickly. Your dogs may not mind though. To keep my beagles happy I play a game with them called "Find It". I put them out in the garage and then hide pieces of treats all over the house.<br />Then I open the door, making sure I'm not standing in their path and say "Find It!". Not that I actually have to say anything at all. They know the game. These treats are great for that because you can tear of cut them up into pieces for hiding or rewards.<br /><br />This treat comes in Chicken Flavor too. Eight Paws up from Snoopy and Chester!

They're a great treat for dogs and a good value. If I forget to give him one after his evening meal, he reminds me of my error with a series of barks.

review/summary: Shake N Bake Pork Pouch
review/text: I remember those days growing up, when Mom wanted to make a quick supper with no fuss or mess. Out came the Shake N Bake. The Original Shake N Bake for pork makes it easy and quick to prepare and cook. The pork came out tasty, the flavoring just right.<br /><br />But it didn't come out as crispy as I remember (maybe I did something wrong), although the pork chops were juicy. I also remember that they supplied the bag, but not with this packaging (which was okay).<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful addition to the food cabinet when you don't want to prepare a long and drawn out meal. Went well with rice and corn.

When I saw this offer I decided to give it a try since I had pork chops in the freezer. Well, I wasn't as impressed with it as I am with the chicken one. It just didn't have as good a flavor. I supposed you could add extra spices to it but I wanted to try it "as is". You can't beat the ease of the Shake n Bake products! Love that aspect. But, unfortunately, this pork one just wasn't my families favorite. But don't let my review keep you from trying it. Your taste buds might be different from ours!

review/summary: Simplifying Dinner Prep with Shake 'n Bake
review/text: I've been using Shake 'n Bake for pork for more years than I'd like to remember. The compliments I've gotten are usually in regard to how tender the chops come out (I use boneless chops). One guest told me he'd never had pork chops this tender.<br /><br />If I am going to oven-bake pork chops, this is the only way I'll make them. I like the flavor of the mix, and it has a good texture. Preparation is super simple, and the chops cook quickly, so it's ideal for last minute prep--get the chops in the oven, and while they're cooking, make a  salad and whatever vegetable you're in the mood for. It sure beats frying.

review/text: Shake 'N Bake pouches are a quick and easy way to get a crispy crunchy coating on pork chops, without the added fat and calories that can accompany traditional dredging and frying.<br /><br />It is lightly seasoned and will appeal to the palette of toddlers (at least mine).  Speaking of kids, this is a great meal to get them involved in, because they love shaking up the breadcrumbs all over the pork.<br /><br />Quick and easy, though you do pay a little more for the convenience than just normal breadcrumbs.

I also used the rest of the packet on chicken, which also came out great.  Really, you cannot go wrong.  My pro tip - first roll the meat in mayo or sour cream, then coat with shake and bake - it will be even juicier.

review/summary: Easy dinner option
review/text: Shake 'n Bake has been around a long time, which should tell you something about the product. It's very easy to use -- just put it in a plastic bag, add your pork chop (or whatever), and shake until the meat is coated with the crumbs. They tell you to put the crumbs in a bowl if you don't happen to have a plastic bag, so you're not limited there.<br /><br />I used the coating for pork chops and they didn't stick to the pan. The underside crumbs were a bit mushy and not crunchy, so I don't know if I should have flipped the pork chops halfway through cooking or what. I guess I'll have to get more Shake 'n Bake and try it again. My husband said it was "okay," which isn't a bad thing. It's not something to rave about<br /><br />The ingredients are enriched wheat flour, various B vitamins, salt, canola oil, sugar, spice, caramel color, dried onions, dextrose, yeast, extracts of paprika, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). There are six 40-calorie servings per pouch. My only qualm is with the "spice," since I'm trying to avoid MSG and I don't know if it can be hidden under "spice." If it's in there, it's a very small amount, but I prefer full disclosure on ingredient labels. The onions are also very, very small. I actually don't like onions, but I do like onion powder. If you have kids who are picky eaters, they won't notice the onions. I didn't. ;)<br /><br />The "original pork" flavor is mild and makes a nice meal by itself, but if you want to spice it up, you can always mix in your own herbs and spices. That makes it very versatile. Overall, a good item to have in your pantry.

review/summary: Good Stuff and the Kids Liked It
review/text: It has been a heck of a long time since I have had a Shake n Bake anything, and I forgot how easy they are to make.  You just get some thinly sliced pork chops, put them plus the shake n bake in a sealed container, shake it to apply a good coating, then pop it in the oven.  The result is a nice chop that has a little coating like it was "fried" without the "fry" greasy component.  It's also pretty tasty.  If you are in a hurry and / or want to try something a little different, give this a try.<br /><br />My young kids thought this was great and something different than the 8 or so meals we seem to rotate with during the month: it's hard enough to get them to try something new, and I was glad they liked it so now we can add this to some sort of dinner rotation.<br /><br />About the only "complaint" I have is it is a little salty - combined with the salt portions in pork, I woke up pretty thirsty in the middle of the night.

review/summary: Actually really good!
review/text: I'm not a big fan of pork. Shocking, I know. I had a package of boneless pork loin in my freezer that I got from a really good sale. I figured I'd try this product to try to use up the pork.<br /><br />On the packet, it says it's enough for 4-6 pork chops. I cut up my pork loin into 8 pieces and the one packet was just enough for all 8 pork chops. It's extremely easy to use. Just take a plastic, zippered bag, empty the contents of the packet, and then put 2 pieces of pork at a time into the bag, shake until they're all coated, and finish off the rest of the pieces.<br /><br />Now let's talk about the taste. Like I said above, I don't really like pork. However, with the Shake N Bake, it gave the pork a really good, seasoned taste. Also, it gave the pork a crunchy coating. Overall, I think this product is an easy and tasty way to "dress up" pork for a lovely dinner. If I ever come across a good pork sale again, I'll be sure to use this particular product to spice it up!

review/summary: Tasty and easy
review/text: I remember the old Shake N Bake commercial from when I was a kid ("It's Shake N Bake, and I helped!") and was curious to try it again.  My sample pouch had enough to coat 6 boneless pork chops, each almost a half inch thick.  Each pouch is designed for 4-6 half inch thick bone-in or boneless chops.<br /><br />It was quick and easy to coat the chops in a zip lock bag after moistening the meat with water.  No messy clean up.  And the pork chops baked up tasty and moist in just a couple minutes more than the recommended 15 minutes.  I used a thermometer to check for the recommended 160 degrees.  The flavor of the coating enhanced and did not dominate the flavor of the pork and it was not too salty.<br /><br />For a quick weeknight meal, I will buy this.

review/summary: Pork the way Mom used to make it ...
review/text: When I was a boy growing up, as part of a large family, my Mom used to buy whichever meat was the cheapest at any given time ... beef, chicken, or pork.  When pork offered the best value, we were usually fed one of three things ... pork roast, pork ribs, or pork chops. Mom almost always used "Shake N Bake" for the pork chops, and I loved it.  As a parent now with his own family, the missus and I decided to give Shake N Bake (abbreviated henceforth as S&B) a try, to see if it matched the memories of our youth.<br /><br />Each packet claims to season two pounds of pork, and based on our experience, I agree.  (We typically cook 4 pork chops at a time, that weigh a bit under 2 pounds, and all of the chops were well coated.)  Pork often dries out when you cook it, and the S&B actually helped keep them moist and juicy.  With regards to flavor, it tasted almost exactly as I remembered, which was a pleasant surprise.  Savory, but not too spicy or too salty.  My wife and two of my children also enjoyed the pork chops and flavor.  My third child, a 6-year old, didn't really like it, but since he doesn't like how much of anything tastes lately, I wouldn't count his "no" very highly.<br /><br />I recommend S&B as a nice way to season your pork or to take a trip down memory lane.  :-)

review/summary: Makes pork chops moist and savory
review/text: I hadn't had Shake n Bake since I was a kid, and I'm not sure if they've changed the recipe, but the flavor seems much more savory than I remember.  It added a nice coating to the pork chops and they came out moist and very flavorful.  My husband, who's not easily impressed food-wise, really liked the flavor of these.  I didn't realize they still made Shake n Bake, but I'm glad to have revisited this childhood favorite and will definitely be making pork chops this way again in the future!

review/summary: Pretty much how I remember it just soggier
review/text: This was definitely easy (read recommended for bachelors, single dad's, or those otherwise cooking-impaired) though because my chops were thick it took almost twice as long too cook. Also, I'm not sure if it was again the size of the chops or their proximity in the pan, but the end product looked more like a kind of mushy batter than the crisp-looking, bread-like substance shown in the picture on the cover of the package.<br /><br />It did taste good, but not so good that a little BBQ sauce wasn't needed to zing it up. But then again I'll use any excuse I can find to consume BBQ sauce.<br /><br />Bottom line - the kids loved it, me and the gf liked it. So it falls somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.

review/summary: Crunchy, Moist and a Little Bland
review/text: Pork has a tendency to dry out during cooking, and Shake N Bake does a very good job keeping all the juices sealed into the meat. Toss your chops in a plastic bag with a packet of Shake N Bake until coated, pop them in the oven and 15 minutes later, you have juicy pork chops with a satisfying crunch you can usually only get from frying.<br /><br />Shake N Bake would be the perfect pork enhancing product if it has a little more taste to it. The ingredients name dried onions, extractives (?) of paprika, and the very descriptive term - spice. I don't know could possibly be included in this secret spice because a Shake N Bake pork chop tastes very close to a regular pork chop with a plain breadcrumb coating.<br /><br />Shake N Bake is quick, easy to use and results in a decent, albeit bland, piece of pork. Good for kids and picky eaters. For those looking juicy pork chops with more zest, I'd suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QYJDNS">McCormick Bag 'n Season Pork Chops, 1.06oz (Pack of 10)</a>.

review/text: There is enough breading in each pouch for about 2 lbs of pork. Simply trim your Pork Chops, get them wet and then shake a few of them at a time in a sealed bag or container. The breading coated very well and didn't leave any non-covered areas. They should only take 15-20 minutes in the 425 degree oven. The pouch says to use � inch thick pieces of pork. If you follow the instructions exactly then it should only take 15 minutes. I cooked 1 inch thick pieces and it took an extra 7 minutes. It still cooked well and didn't really burn except where the breading fell off in the pan. My Pork Chops came out juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The flavor was really good and we loved them.

review/summary: Shake 'n Bake Pork
review/text: This is a staple in my kitchen cupboard. I use it on chops and also on pork patties. My taste buds are not able to pick out the flavors that make up the coating mix, but I do like it and that is what's important. I like using this to bake chops and patties, thus not having that additional fat in my family's diet. It's somewhat easier and less messy then coating the meat in the traditional manner and frying it in a pan. Over the years I have played with this Shake n'Bake by adding a little oil to the tray when putting it in the oven, just to improve the flavor and make the meat have a little more flavor and the coating to have a flavor more like pan-fried without too much oil. I'm sure they wouldn't recommend it, but you can also add more spices to the mix to suit your own taste buds. Don't be afraid to experiment with this type of product. Also remember that you can open a second package if you need more coating mix for more meat.

review/summary: Shake Your Pork Chop
review/text: Honestly -- I do prefer my own recipe (which is to use an egg batter, breading and hot oil and butter in a pan).<br /><br />But we (spouse and self) just tried this product and we consumed a lot less fat and calories using Shake'N Bake. My husband's first words were: "Oh, this is good!" And then, the more he ate, the more he thought he "tasted vegetables." By the time he finished, he said, "It was okay." My first (and lasting) impression was that I tasted, along with the pork chop, a hint of thyme and paprika and not much else.<br /><br />Shake'N Bake adds 40 calories per chop, but my recipe would have added more than that (egg dip plus breadcrumbs). Plus if each chop would absorb 3 tablespoons of oil, another 360 calories (and 42g of fat) per chop would be added. We're always looking for ways to remove calories and fat from our meals. From that perspective, I really like this product! (Isn't there always a trade off between additives, calories, fat, carbs and how something tastes?)<br /><br />I also thought Shake'N Bake was a lot less messy and much more convenient than my recipe. (There was no runny egg-wash dish to rinse out, no sticky breadcrumb mess to clean up and no greasy frying pan or grease splatter.) After shaking the pork, I simply threw away the plastic bag. (I supplied my own ziplock bag.)<br /><br />I had enough coating for six boneless pork chops. After coating each chop, I shook it a little and placed it in an ungreased baking dish. My oven must run a little slow, because I ended up baking the chops longer than the recommended 15 minutes.<br /><br />INFORMATION ON THE BAG:<br /><br />Kraft Shake'N Bake Original Pork<br /><br />Ingredients: enriched wheat flour (wheat flour, niacin, iron, thiamin mononitrate (Vitamin B1), riboflavin (Vitamin B2) folic acid), salt, canola oil, sugar, spice, contains less than 2% of caramel color, dried onions, dextrose, yeast, extractives of paprika, ascorbic acid.<br /><br />Vitamin A 2%<br />Iron 2%<br /><br />Serving size 1/6 pkt = 40 calories / 8g carbs / 1g protein<br /><br />Easy 10 min. prep!

review/summary: Not as flavorful/salty as I remembered...
review/text: To the horror of foodies everywhere, Shake and Bake looks like it's trying to make a comeback. Well, the concept is good, but the flavor just isn't quite there.<br />I do like this cooking method for pork. I grew up in house where pork had to be cooked to death because "you could get trichinosis." Well now you don't have to cook pork forever anymore.<br />Anyway, the amount of S&B powder in the packet was not enough to cover 6 thin pork chops. I took two 4-inch diameter, 1-inch thick boneless chops and pounded them to about 1/2 inch thick. Then I cut those in half. The S&B barely covered those four pieces. I cooked it according to directions and then checked them with a meat thermometer. One had to go back in for a few minutes.<br />My results looked very little like the picture on the package. I'm thinking the "serving suggestion" photo was one chop with an entire packet of S&B packed on to it and fluffed up for the photo. The powder itself is that color, it doesn't develop it in the oven.<br />We had to liberally douse the meat with ketchup or Japanese tonkatsu sauce. You really do need to serve something with it that has some flavor.<br />SOOO, I won't ever buy it. But I might try making something similar with panko crumbs and some seasonings using their cooking method.

review/text: I received a pack of this mix to try.  While I found the cooking time accurate, there was a flavor disappointment.  The chops came out very juicy, which was great.  I guess my biggest gripe is that the flavoring seemed so subtle because there wasn't enough on each chop.  I think the package amount should either increase, or the number of pork chops should be reduced to about four per package.  It seemed to me that the flavor was good when I scraped it together, but it definitely was too thin on each piece when the directions were followed.

review/summary: Yummy on pork chops
review/text: I like a nice pork chop from time to time, and I like it breaded. Trouble is, the breading doesn't always stay put. By the time the chop goes into the oven, those crumbs are everywhere but on the meat. Shake N Bake solved that problem with its innovative shake before baking process, although you could use any breading as long as you shake rather than roll or dip the chops into the crumbs. But these are the folks who apparently invented the process, so one really should refrain from shaking and baking when using other brands of breading. Since a pork chop is pretty tasty with this particular mix, I recommend it. It made my chops nice and crispy, the way I like 'em.

review/text: OK, I failed to follow the directions.  I rubbed one shake-n-bake pork pouch onto four pheasant half breast filets.  Actually, I did the shake thing as instructed then just really rubbed the mixture in.  Then I fried them.  Yes, yes, yes, you're supposed to bake them and avoid all the evils of fried food.  I didn't.  Besides, pheasant is a pretty lean meat anyways.<br /><br />The result was very good.  Good enough to repeat.  I'll likely try this with other wild critter pieces too.  Maybe I'll even try baking them, but prefer to fry so they are in plain sight.  It's too easy to overcook pheasant and get breaded hockey pucks.

review/text: I picked this up out of pure nostalgia.  Shake 'N' Bake is one of those "easy dinners" that reminds me of my childhood, with three brothers and a working single mother meant that our family dinners were quick-and-dirty.  TV dinners with Salisbury steak.  Cardboard pizzas heated up in the oven.  And a quick round of Shake 'N' Bake.  Of these, Shake 'N' Bake was always a hit because as kids we liked shaking the bag. And then voila! Fried chicken or pork cutlet!<br /><br />The nostalgia factor was fun when I made this, putting the pork in a bag and giving it some wild shakes.  The food cooked up decently, and there is nothing really wrong with Shake 'N' Bake.  Ultimately though, there is no real need for it either.  Anyone with a decent kitchen can whip together some flower, bread crumbs, and spices for a home-cooked Shake 'N' Bake anytime they want.<br /><br />Shake 'N' Bake just saves you a little time, by having everything proportioned out and in a bag, ready to go.  If you are like my mother was, with three kids and a job, I can imagine being thankful for easy convenience.  But as with most things relying on the nostalgia factor, one trip down memory lane was enough for me.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: Pork chops can be intimidating. Your classic chop is a very lean piece of meat that can dry-out very quickly, especially if you're concerned about ensuring that the meat is well done because, after all, it's pork.<br /><br />There are a couple ways around this problem. One is to substitute a less lean cut of pork. The less lean pork is far less expensive, and has more flavor on it's own, but it's also fairly fatty. Another way is to plan ahead and soak your chops in a seasoned brine over night. A third way is to bread your chops -- and that's where Shake 'n Bake comes in.<br /><br />Now, first off, I advise strongly not to use this product with shoulder steaks or blade steaks. Use rib chops. The Shake 'N Bake mix includes fat (to keep the breading from sticking to the pan), so it works best with very lean pork. Second, do not oil or grease your pan.<br /><br />Do you need to shake in a bag? Well, you could just dredge, but when you shake in a bag, you get all the sides coated, not just the big sides.<br /><br />I was able to coat four rib chops, and had some coating left. Resist the urge to sprinkle it on the already breaded chops. It won't bake properly if you do that. If you disregarded my advice and bought pork blade steaks instead of chops, you're probably not going to have enough breading for more than three, as the blade steaks generally have more surface area than a rib chop does.<br /><br />As for flavor, this is a very traditional flavor, much as I remembered from my youth. It's quite obvious that we're talking about a cornmeal-based breading, with mild flavors such as onion and celery powder, and only a hint of pepper. If you like a little more bite, you can add a couple extra shakes of black pepper to the mix.<br /><br />If you want to make breaded pork chops from scratch, you certainly can. Get some cornmeal, and some seasonings. Don't forget to grease your pan if you do it yourself. But you know what? Buying cornmeal and spices in bulk isn't less expensive if you're not going to use them up before they loose their freshness. Shake 'N Bake comes sealed in one-meal sized packages, and even if you want to adjust the seasoning, it starts out from a nice baseline.<br /><br />Personally, I like my pork chops grilled. Broiled is another good way. But like I said earlier, pork is very lean, and it's easy to ruin it. So if you're looking to get more lean pork into your diet, the easy way is to go with breaded pork chops, and Shake 'N Bake is the easiest way to do that.<br /><br />But remember: Get rib chops. Do NOT substitute pork blade steaks for breaded pork chops. That's the fast track to a meal that only gets 1 or 2 stars.

review/text: You all know Amazon for its forward-looking attitude, and this is also obvious in the review pages. That's why, in this review of Shake and Bake Original Pork, I will be calling on my Aunt Agatha to do a special review for all of you.<br /><br />By Interpretive Dance.<br /><br />Agatha is getting on now, but in her day she hoped to be a prima ballerina (even though she only made it to centesimo ballerina). She studied under the expatriate star, Tumbelova, and her husband, Serge Trouserin, but to no great effect. But Agatha could never resist the lure of the tu-tu, and that's why we have her here today. And here she comes!<br /><br />Moving quickly yet forcefully, belying her many years, she is flying around the stage, waving here hands hither and thither. Ah, but now she has stopped, striking poses in just one spot. Now a slow but joyous circling of the stage, a plie here and there, almost in the style of George Balanchine. She's reminding us of the Degas painting, "The Ballet Class," but more in imitation of the teacher than any of the dancers.<br /><br />And so this delightful moment ends, as Aunt Agatha slips off into the wings and onto a chair, breathing heavily. I think we can all divine what Shake and Bake Original Pork is like from such a performance, but for those who missed the significance, I can say that from eating it, it's somewhat bland, but probably just what the target market expects.<br /><br />No doubt, when she gets her breath back, Aunt Agatha will delight us with more interpretations, but for now, we'll let her rest. And you can feel proud of yourself that you were in at the beginning of a new kind of product review, thanks to Amazon.

review/summary: I don't HATE it
review/text: Last night I tried this product according to the instructions.  My oven was at the right temperature, and I baked for just over 12 minutes (around 157 degrees according to my tests).  And I tried it with some center-cut pork chops with the bone in, which should have made the resulting dish better than if I'd chosen plain old no-bone pork chops, but 100% of the three people who consumed these chops agreed they would have preferred them with no coating at all.<br /><br />One person said that the one part of her chop that I missed coating with the product on one side was the single best bite she took.  Another tester said she wished I had merely seared the two surfaces of the chops and left off the coating altogether.<br /><br />I myself appreciated the crunch of this coating, but every bite had an off flavor that I would prefer had not been there.  I too would have preferred no coating at all to the coating this product added to the pork chops.<br /><br />In case you're interested, here's the ingredients list.  ENRICHED WHEAT FLOUR (WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, IRON, THIAMIN MONONITRATE (VITAMIN B1), RIBOFLAVIN (VITAMIN B2), FOLIC ACID), SALT, CANOLA OIL, SUGAR, SPICE, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF CARAMEL COLOR, DRIED ONIONS, DEXTROSE, YEAST, EXTRACTIVES OF PAPRIKA, ASCORBIC ACID.  I think you can whip up a reasonable substitute -- except for the caramel color -- by mixing flour and ground corn meal with salt and paprika, and I'd add some pepper if I were you unless you don't want me to.<br /><br />Why shake?<br /><br />Also, I'm not sure why you should bother to put the coating and the chops into a zip-top bag and shake them, especially since you must supply the bag, and especially especially since you must discard it immediately since it's coated in raw pork ick and which also adds maybe 15 cents to the price of the product.  Why can't you just dump the 2.25 ounces of coating onto a plate and dredge?  I get the bake part of Shake 'N Bake, but I don't get the shake part.<br /><br />The package says to buy four to six half-inch-thick pork chops, and I bought one for each of us three diners plus one extra for a total of -- just a moment while I whip out my spreadsheet here -- four.  As you can see from the photograph I've thoughtfully added, they were pretty big chops, and there was not nearly enough coating to have done the last one, not to mention a fifth and sixth.<br /><br />This morning for breakfast I fried the emergency backup pork chop in a little butter but obviously with no coating, and it was much more agreeable than the coated one last night.<br /><br />As a result, I conclude that this product needs improvement, and I rate it two stars.  I'd rate it one star, but that means that I literally hate it, which is a bit strong.  I just have no immediate or even long-term plans to use it again.<br /><br />In case you were wondering, as I can attest from having run the experiments for you, this product does not improve the flavor or texture of tapioca, a mocha latte, or vanilla ice cream (or probably any other flavor, but vanilla was all we had).<br /><br />-- Update: I don't see where we reviewers can add photos to the product page, so I take back what I said above about "the photograph I've thoughtfully added."  Maybe later.<br /><br />-- Update of August 8, 2011: I've now been able to add the photo, so please stop emailing me asking when the heck I'm going to get it posted.

review/text: I don't fix much pork (I don't know why?!), but I picked up some (4) thin cut pork tenderloins to use with this product.  I had plenty of Shake'N Bake crumbs left over to do more chops/tenderloins.  I liked how the crumbs gave the pork a light taste and certainly did NOT overpower the meat itself.  I don't like tons of flavorings to overpower what I'm eating, so if that is what you typically want/need (like tons of salt, garlic, etc.), I'm not sure if this will do it for you.  You could probably add some garlic or spices to the crumb mix if you needed to.  I'm currently on a low-carb diet, so I was not going to put my pork in the mix, but, looking at the label, it really wasn't too bad - so I had some myself!  And, even if you don't want to eat the breading, but you do want the flavor, it was easy to scrape off of the port after cooking.  I liked it, my kids liked it, I would give it a try again!

But what you do get with Shake 'N Bake Original Pork coating is a way to turn a merely adequate dinner entree into something with a little zip.<br /><br />My plain old pieces of boneless pork, with minimal preparation and cooking time, were turned into something crispy and tangy.  Pair this off with a simple sidedish, string beans maybe, and you have a perfectly satisfying and easy-to-fix weeknight dinner.  It also doesn't hurt that both calorie and carb counts for this product are minimal!<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed my free sample of Shake 'N Bake Original Pork coating, and will certainly pick up more at my own expense in the near future.

review/text: I grew up with Shake n Bake and it still remains a delicious way to bake port chops.  It is easy to prepare your meat in the shaker bag.  The tasty topping seals in juices and prevents you meat from drying out.  If you want an easy way to prepare pork chops with minimal mess and preparation, then Shake n Bake for Pork is for you.

review/summary: Bland and not worth it!
review/text: For much less than the buck per package it costs, you can easily make a tastier breading.<br /><br />The entire family gave this a 2 star rating (two adults and 3 kids).  There was not much flavor nor texture added to the pork chops.<br /><br />It was certainly easy, but it doesn't take much to fix up your own breading so saving an extra couple of minutes is not worth the lack of flavor in my opinion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product and will likely stay away from other Shake 'N Bake products.

review/summary: After all these years it still tastes wonderful
review/text: Shake n' Bake is a classic staple that has been around since 1965 (I believe). The idea behind this product is to mimic fried foods without frying.  Simply take the "Shake n' Bake" and put it in a plastic bag, add your meat, in the case of this product pork and literally shake the bag to coat the pork and bake it.  Once the pork is cooked it is crispy and juicy just as if it were fried.<br /><br />This product is still wonderful after all of these years.  With regards to this review I utilized pork when I prepared it and it tasted great, a nice crisp and seasoned taste without being over powering.  Now if somebody wanted to "doctor up" this seasoning it could be done.  Just add some extra spices while you are "shaking".  In addition, there isn't a reason why a cook would have to be limited to pork.  Chicken and/or fish certainly could be used and would taste magnificent.  This is a healthy alternative to frying food and really leaves little room for improvement.  I would highly suggest this product to both the novice cook and the "seasoned" chef.

review/summary: Always easy and good!
review/text: Shake N Bake is my son's favorite, ever since he was a toddler he has loved it. He's a senior in high school and his birthday dinner *still* must be Shake N Bake. Be it chicken or pork chops, he doesn't care, his only requirement is a coating of Shake N Bake!<br /><br />Whenever we have to feed a large group at once, my favorite way to make Shake N Bake is to coat your meat of choice with whatever flavor of Shake N Bake you have handy (they work equally well with any meat). Melt a stick of butter or margarine or even pour some olive oil into the bottom of your casserole dish, and bake the meat according to package directions (turning about halfway through). Your food will come out with a crispy coating and a juicy, delicious flavor!<br /><br />If you need topping for a casserole or mac n cheese, a sprinkling of Shake N Bake on top will serve in a pinch as well.

review/summary: Go With Your Taste Buds
review/text: Although the packaging is labeled for Pork, this flavor of Shake and Bake goes well with chicken as well.  Nothing could be easier.  Mix the seasoning with your meat and bake.  You get the fried meat flavor without all the oil and mess of deep frying.  It can be a little on the salty side, so you may want to moderate the size of the meat.  The spice blend complements, but does not overwhelm the meat flavor.

review/summary: I loved it but the son not so much
review/text: I'm not sure if it was a nostalgia thing but it has been ages since I had Shake 'n Bake so when I saw this retro packaged item, I went for it.<br /><br />As usual, the prep was simple. Shake and bake. Love that.<br /><br />While it was baking, it made the house smell wonderful. I loved that too.<br /><br />When it came to eating it, I enjoyed it. Crisp but not too crisp. Good flavor and not too salty.<br /><br />My son wasn't quite as taken. I suppose it may be because he was thinking it would be more of a tonkatsu type of taste, but tonkatus is fried and this is baked. That is what I explained to him but he was still on the fence about it.<br /><br />But too bad for him. I'll be getting this again. The ease of use and the taste and the fact that it is baked and not fried are reasons enough for me.

review/summary: crispy crust with flavor
review/text: I have to say i was surprised with the shaken bake. I rarely cook pork and decided to try, I picked up some pork loin 1/2 thick and tossed them around in a bowl, I covered 8 pieces with enough left to sprinkle on top. I even cooked them on a cookie sheet on the covered grill instead of the oven as it was to hot to cook inside. I checked on them with a meat tester and did not turn them as listed in instructions. They came out tender inside with a crispy crust, everyone liked them. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because although I liked the flavor it was very salty to me, no one else noticed but I rarely use salt cooking and it really sticks out to me. I would be willing to try a reduced sodium version. 240mg per 1/6 of a packet.

review/text: We have used this several different times now and really enjoyed it.  We use the original flavor for our daughter, and then the spicy for us.<br /><br />Here are a few tips that we think work well:<br />1. Cut the pork into small pieces, 1 inch square for example.  They cook faster and more evenly.<br />2. It seems that using a bag and shaking wastes a lot of the crumbs.  Instead, put a little bit of water in one bowl, pour some shake-n-bake in a second bowl and leave the package open and accessible.  Then dip the pork pieces in the water, let them drip, then roll them around in the seasoning.  If you need more, pour more in.  Seems to work well.<br /><br />Yum!

review/summary: Easy and Tasty
review/text: I have been using Shake `n Bake with my chicken for year but never thought to use it with pork chops until they released the Original Pork flavor.  This product is as easy to use as their other products: pour the Shake `n Bake into a sealable bag: put the pork chops individual, shake and then put them in the oven.  The package says it can be used from four to six pork chops and after using it with four I would not be surprised if I could have been able to coat four more pork chops with one package.  The taste is so similar to the chicken version there were some bites when I forgot I was eating pork chops and was eating chicken with Shake `n Bake on it.  Much like the chicken version, the breading can fall off while cutting, but that is really the only negative I can say about the product.

review/summary: Second best coating for a pork chop
review/text: There are few dinners easier and more satisfying than a coated pork chop.  For those that don't want the hassle and calories of frying, Shake N Bake and similar coatings have been a staple for years.  Just an egg wash, coat it with the mix and bake.  Its just that easy and just that good.<br /><br />However, after trying both, I would still have to give the nod to Oven Fry extra crispy pork coating.  The SNB is a finer more powdery texture whereas the Oven Fry gives it a thicker more flavorful crust that keep juices in better.  Oven Fry gets a five from me, SNB only a three.  But either way you go, its better than a naked chop.

review/text: You really can't beat a handy Shake and Bake packet on a night when time is pressing and hungry kids are waiting. All the Shake and Bake products seem to have this time saving benefit of just rinse your meat, shake, bake, and serve. So, the question to address is the flavoring. The flavoring was average. It's not something you would want to eat on a daily basis (as you would get tired of it) but it's certainly tastey enough for a 'once a month' family dinner. When you need something quick, easy, and don't have time to be frying... this is the way to go.

review/summary: Bland & Mushy - very "School Lunch"ish
review/text: I cook a lot, and I have a few ways of preparing pork chops that my teen boys like.  I picked up this Shake N Bake pouch with the hope that it could fill in on those really busy nights.  I didn't expect it to be as good as 'from scratch', but I expected it to be edible.<br /><br />If you were alive in the 70's, you know that Shake n Bake is a pre-made coating you put in a bag along with your meat.  As you may have guessed, you shake the bag, then bake your meat.  It's simple, and it's a low fat alternative to stovetop methods that need oil or butter. But the result is pretty pedestrian.  The coating doesn't crisp very well; it was downright mushy in spots, and the 'spices' in the mix were bland bland bland.<br /><br />Pork is already low fat and bland.  It needs a little bit of fat for flavor.  I don't fry any meat, but I do sautee my pork chops (coated with Panko & my own spices)in a splash of olive oil , which makes them moister, tastier, and crunchier.  To me, the baking just didn't work well.  Maybe if the SnB coating was actually, you know, flavorful, it would have helped.  But between the baking and the coating, the pork chops were bland and mushy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  My hungry teen boys picked at them and asked to never have them again.

review/summary: Good stuff, but not very much of it...
review/text: The Pork Shake N Bake has always been a simple way to make any old chop a good bit tastier. With minimal mess, trouble and time, you get healthier-than-fried breaded chops that are juicy and taste good. It's not exactly gourmet, but after a long day, it's an easy way to start a meal without having to resort to fast food. The seasoning in the Shake N Bake make the pork sufficiently tasty, but doesn't overpower it like some mixes can.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it's that you may need more than one pouch if you're cooking more than 3 or 4 chops. I was probably being a bit liberal with them, but I had enough for three thick-cut boneless pork chops and there wasn't much left over (maybe a tablespoon). That's a minor gripe, but if you're cooking a lot of chops, especially thick ones, you're going to need more than a single pouch.

review/text: Shake N Bake is a longtime favorite in our household. This pork version does what it's supposed to do: It gives your pork a tasty, slightly crispy and flavorful coating that doesn't completely overpower the flavor of the pork itself. Don't let the "pork" label fool you into believing it's one-dimensional, however, because this could just as easily be used on chicken as well. In the end, it is more expensive than bread crumbs, but in my opinion the flavor and convenience are worth it. Can't go wrong with a dinner classic like this.

review/summary: No plastic bag for shaking, less Shake N Bake than the standard box - flavor is the same
review/text: Shake N Bake in the original pork flavor has been a guilty pleasure of mine since I was a little girl. When I was a kid, it was often what I would request for my birthday dinner and I still crave Shake N Bake pork chops every now and then.<br /><br />When I selected the Shake N Bake Pork Pouch, I really wasn't sure what it was. I thought maybe it was a pouch that you put the pork chop in and cooked it in the pouch. I was completely wrong.<br /><br />The pouch is just a packet of the Shake N Bake mix. That's it. There is no little plastic bag to shake the chops in, so you have to provide your own bag. Not only that, but the pouch is only 2.25-ounces, as opposed to the 3-ounce packets you get in the standard Shake N Bake box, so it coats fewer pork chops. To be fair, it does state on the back of the pouch that this packet makes 4-6 pork chops instead of the 6-8 chops the 3-ounce packet makes.<br /><br />For me, this just isn't something I am very interested in, with one exception. I confess I am one of those people who like extra Shake N Bake on my pork chops. I often use 1 � - 2 packets for 6-8 pork chops. The Shake N Bake pouch would be handy to use along with one of the 3-ounce packets to accommodate my desire for extra Shake N Bake.<br /><br />As for the flavor, it is the same Shake N Bake Original Pork flavor I know and love. There are no changes to the flavor, just the packaging.<br /><br />I haven't found these in any of my local grocery stores yet, but they can be ordered through Amazon. I honestly don't know that I would buy these. I just don't see a need for these pouches and will stick to the normal box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVVQ">Shake 'N Bake Seasoned Coating Mix, Original Pork, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/summary: Shake 'n Bake is an unchanged classic
review/text: We used to use Shake 'n Bake more often a few years ago, and I was curious as to why SnB was being offered for review. Had it changed or improved? By all appearances, no, but it had new packaging. Still, I ordered it and followed the package directions very carefully, maybe using only a slightly thinner cut of chop than pictured on the packaging.<br /><br />What came out of the oven was what we always had after using SnB: A chop with good flavor, but kind of mushy breading. The only place where the breading crisped up was around fat. But, considering that this is how SnB always worked for us before, I wasn't surprised.<br /><br />The spices used in the mix are the same as the past, and they flavor a chop well. The mushy breading isn't a big deal - what matters to us is how the food tastes. Boneless pork chops need a lot of help in the flavor department and Shake 'n Bake is one quick and cheap way to dress them up. Three stars means SnB isn't bad, but it's not a taste revelation, either.

Simply pour the crumbs into a plastic bag or a bowl with a well-fitting lid, add the chops one at a time, and shake, shake, shake. After that, it's off to the oven for a while then, voila, you've got tender, juicy pork chops with a nicely seasoned coating.<br /><br />If you're watching your diet, you'll be pleased to know the sodium levels, the carb count and even the calories on this aren't outrageous. They've used spices and herbs to make up the flavor, and the coating is light enough that it's nothing like your usual battered or breaded meats. Plus, there's no oil involved -- use a cooking spray on your baking sheet, so with leaner pork you'll be eating lower-fat, too!

review/summary: Used it with chicken instead!
review/text: Unconventional, I know - classic Shake n Bake is made for pork, and who doesn't love a Shake n Bake pork chop?! But I eat more chicken than pork these days and I wanted to try classic SnB with chicken.  I used skin-on chicken legs/thighs. Coated them, placed in pan, covered with foil and let cook at 400 for 30 mins. Then I uncovered the pan, sprinkled on the remaining mix and cooked for an additional 35 minutes. Loved it! The coating stayed with the skin, and crispy chicken skin+Shake n Bake coating = delish!

review/summary: A Classic for a Reason
review/text: Shake N' Bake is always a winner in our house. I like to use thin, boneless pork chops, they cook in about 20 minutes. The Shake N' Bake coating stays crispy and is full of flavor, without a lot of preparation or clean up.<br />I also sometimes use a packet as a topping for casseroles.  You know that green bean casserole that people often serve at Thanksgiving? Try tossing French fried onions with a packet of Shake N' Bake and sprinkle ontop of the casserole before baking. It's delicious!

review/summary: Handy and Tasty
review/text: We often pick up boneless pork when it's on sale because it's versatile.<br />Having this coating on hand allows me to toss together a quick dinner that we always enjoy.<br /><br />I often add a little ground sage and black pepper to the coating.  Sometimes a little parmesan cheese.<br />If you're only preparing a small amount and have plenty of leftover coating for another small meal, a trick my brother shared with me is to use a good sized ziplock bag for the coating.  The leftover coating can be labeled "Pork" and dated and tossed into the freezer instead of throwing it out.  Same with chicken coating.  I often mix up my own coating and have plenty leftover for another meal.

review/text: I feel like an expert reviewer for this product.  We have used it as long as I can remember.  In the summer, there's nothing like pork on the grill, but when the weather cools, ths product makes chops delicious and juicy every time.  It comes with everything you need, just wet meat, shake in the bag, then bake. If I could make one adjustment, I would add a little more product to each package, as I would like a bit of a thicker "crust".  But this is a product I grew up on and never get tired of.

review/summary: Nice but nothing special
review/text: I have never tried any of the Shake N Bake products before.  I was mainly attracted to it because most breadings made from scratch require egg or milk and some sort of crumb, and I don't always have those ingredients on hand.  The Shake N Bake for pork only requires a bit of water to dampen the chops and the contents of the pouch -- couldn't be easier.<br /><br />I used some very inexpensive "special purchase" chops; they were thin but huge, not the conventional center or loin cuts, and one of them was more than enough for dinner.<br /><br />I was only making three big chops, so instead of putting the mix in a zip bag, I just poured some of the mix on a plate and dipped the chops in.  Very easy.  There was plenty of mix left, so it was a very economical meal.<br /><br />As for the flavor, well, it was okay, not bad but not great.  We specifically tasted paprika and onion powder.  I would prefer flavors that blend a bit better.<br /><br />The cheap chops came out very juicy and tender with the Shake N Bake.<br /><br />The covering was also a bit unexpected.  It is very fine and a bit grainy, not a bread crumb texture.<br /><br />We microwaved the leftovers the next day, and I would not recommend doing that because they got soggy.  The chops probably should have been warmed up in a toaster oven or maybe a skillet on low heat.

review/summary: Improves Taste... A Little
review/text: Well, it doesn't get easier than this.  Put boneless pork chops in a zip lock bag, pour in contents, and shake away.  Now bake for 15 minutes.<br /><br />Although the taste improves compared to simply baking the pork chops with nothing on them, the improvement isn't significant.  I'm looking for a little more flavor here, but Shake 'N Bake is a bit on the boring side.  If I had to do it over again, I'd probably add some other spices to the mix or on the chop afterwards.  I'm getting used to Thai, Indian, Mexican, etc. food so this Shake 'N Bake just isn't cutting it.  I've found very flavorful spice packets for cheaper than this, so price cannot be an good excuse.<br /><br />Again, Shake 'N Bake helps improve the taste, but then again so does basic salt and pepper.  I think these packets are personally worth about 50 cents to me.

review/summary: Tastes Differ
review/text: Of course, reviewing something for taste is about as subjective as it gets-- but I can only say that this wasn't my favorite. I normally use breadcrumbs and fry pork on the stove, but I liked giving baking a try. The flavor of the pork worked out just fine, but I wasn't crazy about the Shake 'N' Bake seasonings. I prefer my old breadcrumbs.<br /><br />You can just put the seasonings in a Ziploc bag and shake them on as suggested, or just put the seasonings into a dish and coat the pork that way. It's certainly simple enough either way, a healthier alternative to frying, and doesn't require a lot of clean-up. Three people ate this and all gave sort of a mild thumbs-up. I wouldn't eat it again, but I liked it enough to try the chicken flavor next.

review/summary: Very good breading with interesting flavors
review/text: I normally buy House Autry or similar specialized breading when frying or oven baking up some fish, pork or beef.  So I was a little skeptical to try an old brand breading "Shake n Bake".  I grew up on shake and bake.  In the early days it had a cheap garlic paprika flavor that lingered in your mouth after a meal.  However, they must have improved the product because this Shake N Bake Pork was great.  It was not cheap or stale tasting.  Working it in with a little flower produced a very mild and pleasant experience.  I highly recommend considering this product when breading some thick pork chops.

review/summary: A different way to pork
review/text: I do love pork chops but I cook most of mine by frying or in my rice cooker. But this gives me an excuse to try something different. Now this package does not come with a bag to "shake" in, so you will need a zip-lock bag. Also one word of warning! You are better off using unfrozen pork chops. Even after defrosting them there will be too much moisture in the meat and your shake & bake coating will be mushy.<br /><br />The breaded coating has a little seasoning, but not too much. Each time I used a package, there was more than enough for all the chops. It baked without burning the breading and was easy to clean up. One of the nice things about the "shake in a bag" aspect is that you can add more seasoning if you wish. It will take a little trial and error to get it right for you, but it is always easier to add than to take back.

review/text: I generally grill pork chops, but this was a nice change. The Shake 'n Bake didn't stick quite as well as I remembered when Mom made it as a kid, and since other reviewers have no mention of the problem, I'm chalking that up to my lack of culinary skill. Still, the taste was a really nice change of pace. I generally don't like sauces or gravies or anything that changes the flavor of my meat considerably, and this didn't. It was a nice departure from normal, but not so much that I tasted Shake 'n Bake and not my chops. It added to the flavor of the meat instead of overpowering it. I'm glad I rediscovered this old favorite and will use it again soon.

review/text: I've only used Shake N Bake for pork a few times in the past and decided to let my youngest (he's 10) give this a try.  While I supervised, he did all the work which to say isn't too hard.  It didn't come with a bag so we used a ziplock 1 gallon size. The product is simple to use and a quick fix if you're looking for something that requires little prep work.<br /><br />The taste is the same as I remember and would have preferred something a little spicier and not so heavily coated.  The pork was fairly tender but the coating does make it a bit messy. I thought it was okay but doubt I'll get it again.

review/text: This is an OK product for occasional use but not something that adds much to the preparation or improvement of the meal.  The pork chops were adequately crisp on the outside, moist and tender inside and the coating added a blandly salty and vaguely processed flavor.  I did not use gigantic pieces of meat and barely had enough to coat 4 chops.  It is cheaper, easier, more versatile and healthier to toss together my own ingredients for chicken or pork.

review/text: I have only praise for this product.  I give it 4 stars and not 5 for it does not come with a bag.  It is called SHAKE N BAKE but there is no bag to shake it in!  Other than that this product is great.  It is so easy to use.  I used 4 nice thick boneless pork chops and after shaking the coating fully covered all four.  It only needs to bake for 15 minutes and the meat does not need to be turned over at all during the cooking.  I found the coating to be delicious.  It had a light seasoned taste that was very tasty without overpowering the taste of the pork.  The coating mix also kept the pork inside tender and moist without getting too crispy on the outside.  Just crispy enough.  It certainly added just the right flavor to the light taste of the pork.  I added baked potato, peas and a salad and had a very tasty meal.<br /><br />I hadn't used SHAKE N BAKE since I was a kid and then tended to use the chicken more.  I will definitely use this product on a regular basis now as well as give the chicken a go again.  Highly recommended.  Very easy and quick to use providing a delicious way to cook your pork.

review/text: I haven't used any Shake 'N Bake in years (and when I did use it, I used the version for chicken) so I was curious to see how the product was after all these years.

And it was very easy to use - like the name of the product says, shake on the coating and bake. It's easy to use and tastes good - it doesn't get any better than that.

review/summary: Little Bland, no shaking bag in pouch
review/text: I have tried a variety of the Shake & Bake products over the years and mostly enjoyed them. This one we used on standard pork chops, followed the directions and served for an every day family dinner. The first thing is that there was not a shaking bag included in the package - we had to use a ziploc bag instead. The seasoning went on pretty evenly with no major clumping. It baked nicely, no soggy spots on the meat, but it wasn't really a crisp crust either. The pork chops were nice and tender.<br /><br />The flavor... well that left a lot to be desired. It was bland to everyone at the table. One person added salt, another added black pepper, and a third felt the need to add both. Normally if we use a marinade or commercial rub on meat, we don't add anything else to it at the table. So if you are looking for something with a bold flavor, spicey or even perky taste, this probably isn't the mix for you.

review/summary: A long forgotten favorite
review/text: I haven't had this for so many years I cant even guess how long its been. My self, I've never used this before for cooking so I don't have anything to compare it to. I used it a couple nights ago on some boneless pork country style ribs. I usually do these on the grill and like them because of they're nice thick chunks of meat. I had a package that was going to be grilled so I used them with this instead. Baked them in my Oster Convection Toaster Oven. Used a wire rack inside the broiling pan that came with it and baked them. The coating kept all the juices in the meat! I couldn't believe that there wasn't one single drip from any of them! And I didn't trim the small amount of fat that was on them either. When grilling these they always drip grease and I have to watch that they don't burn when the grease catches on fire. They turned out very nice and juicy and the meat had a nice flavor to it too. It wasn't real spicy and it was like the coating hardly has any seasoning at all in it. Which is nice because next time I use it I can add my favorite seasonings without having a conflict of flavors making them taste weird. And I'm definitely going to be getting some more of this and start using it.

review/summary: So easy to use and it makes a great moist pork chop
review/text: I invited guests over for dinner and made 8 large pork chops in the oven using the packet. I added a few panko bread crumbs and I added salt, pepper, parsley, garlic salt and onion salt for more flavor. I put the pork chops in the oven and cooked them for nearly an hour and they came out moist and flavorful and there were no leftovers. The guests said they loved them and I even taught my daughter how to use the packet so she could make them too one day. I would buy these and use the chicken version too. I love that baking is healthier and is less fuss than frying too.
