review/text: When I was a kid, a very long time ago, we ate a lot of Spam.  My mother worked.  Spam was great.  Cold it made a good sandwich, fried, even better.<br />  I recently bought a can after not tasting it for many years.  I was a little surprised how watery, greasy and just plain nasty it was.  I tried frying a piece and it almost disappeared.  I gave it 2 stars only because I figured Hormel had to meet a price point and this was the best they could do.<br />  I find it funny and sad how many people think this crap actually tastes good.  Shows how our standards has fallen over the years.

review/summary: Wife tested, husband approved!
review/text: A few months ago I was searching Amazon for sugar-free products when I came across this one. My husband grew up with raw, unfiltered honey often given as gifts from his grandparents. Two years ago he was diagnosed as being diabetic making regular honey off limits. Strangely enough four months ago I developed a severe allergy to honey (I didn't know that my grandfather was allergic to it as well), and promptly broke out in hives.<br /><br />When I first saw the imitation honey I simply didn't believe it, I started researching it waiting to find the catch. Being vegetarian/borderline vegan I was concerned about odd animal byproducts that creep into the strangest things. I emailed the company discovered that Maltitol Syrup (the main ingredient) is malted from corn. I have used other sweeteners, mainly Splenda, and have been frustrated with the fact that it doesn't act like sugar, leaving a pronounced aftertaste in most foods. Upon further research I found that I could buy an individual bottle of this brand of imitation honey at our local Walgreens (I wasn't going to buy a case of something and find out that it was unusable or tasted horrible). (Update: Walgreens no longer sells this product, either locally where I am or on their website there is no listing for it any more.)<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that it's about half as sweet as honey (a plus in my opinion) but the texture is the same. It's relatively easy to get used to, especially if you haven't had real honey in some time. I have to admit that the first shock I had was when we made pigs in a blanket with veggie hot dogs. I couldn't believe what I saw when pulling them off the pan, the imitation honey had crystallized when it was baked! This is the first sugar-free sweeter I have found that mimics what sugar does, and often makes a LARGE difference in baked goods. The only thing it doesn't do that sugar can is brown cookies and such.<br /><br />I have made whole wheat bread and sugar-free peanut butter cookies with this, Hubby said that the cookies were JUST like the 'real' ones, and even my non-diabetic brother said that even he couldn't tell the difference (he's very picky about his food) and half of the flour was even whole wheat!<br /><br />So what's the best part? Where we get it locally it costs 2 for $5 and standard honey costs about $4.50 for a single bottle of the same size. And buying it in bulk from Amazon (with the super shipper savings) saves me the time and gas money as well!<br /><br />As for David S. Robbins' comment:<br /><br />Yes it is Sugar free (does not contain sugar) and if a diabetic is being responsible and monitoring their food intake as they should, there is no reason to avoid this brand. For the peanut butter cookies I made there was less than 3g carbs per cookie from the imitation honey. Maltitol Syrup is often listed in the ingredients of the Murray's cookies, one of our favorite (but pricey) brands. As with anything, use in moderation because how you use it is just as much of a factor of how much you use.<br /><br />I checked on the Carb Smart website to look at the product you recommended and it may have a significantly reduced carb amount, but not only is it more expensive that even regular honey, there is "natural honey flavor" listed in the ingredients making it prohibitive to me because of my allergies.

review/text: I found this in my local Hannaford supermarket.  It sells for $13.99 per pound and it is probably the best American alternative to Parmigiano Reggiano that usually retails for $20 or more per pound.<br />This is an award-winning cheese from Wisconsin.  It has the granular texture of Parmigiano Reggiano, but seems to be a little creamier, so it seemed that I ended up grating more of it.  It melts nicely and adds a lot of flavor as a pasta garnish.

review/summary: World's Best All Purpose Marinade
review/text: Chiavetta's is legendary in the Buffalo area. Their entire line of sauces and salad dressings<br />are top notch, but this apple cider based marinade is pure magic.<br /><br />This stuff has transformative power. I've even used it on steak and the results were amazing,<br />but its best on chicken and pork (chops, ribs, and particularly tenderloin). Use it sparingly<br />and don't overmarinate, you'll be very happy with the results. A bottle of this stuff should<br />last you a long time, or maybe not cause its addictive.<br /><br />This is how Chiavetta's Catering makes chicken: You shake the bottle to mix its combination of<br />vinegar, salt, secret spices, and garlic then marinate uncooked chicken in it for at least 30<br />minutes before grilling the chicken over charcoal. During the grilling, you continue to baste<br />the chicken with the marinade, then remove the chicken, place it in a pan, baste it again, cover<br />it and let the sauce steam into the meat for 10 or 15 minutes.<br /><br />Simple enough, right? The biggest tribute to this stuff are the number of copycat recipes on<br />the web. Glad to see the company has expanded their distribution, oddly not down to Florida<br />yet cause there's a lot of New Yorkers down here. Please note, this is a marinade, not a sauce<br />so no pouring this on the finished product, its too strong. Enjoy!

review/text: I tried this Ramen on a whim.  I normally steer clear of Ramen noodles because they have a high fat content and the broth pretty much tastes like briny water no matter what flavor you are eating. These noodles are truly delicious. First of all they are organic, which is a draw for me.  Second they are baked, which makes them healthier for those of us who need to be conscious about fat content.  I can't say enough about how tasty these noodles are.  Mixing in the flavor packet, I could actually SEE the lemongrass and ginger.  Super flavorful and very unique.  I love these noodles.  Highly recommended.

I keep some on hand for days when there's no time to stop and make a meal.

review/text: Regular ramen has got to be one of the worst possible things to eat from a nutritional basis -- fried noodles and chemical flavorings.  This low fat ramen really tastes great, and without all the extra fat of the "regular" ramen products.  The seasoning packet is high in sodium, which is typical, but it has a good flavor and you can definitely taste the ginger and lemongrass.<br /><br />One tip -- don't overcook the noodles!  They can get pretty mushy if you cook them for the recommended time on the package.  I generally cook them a minute or so less than recommended, and add in steamed broccoli, peas, or other veggies and some shrimp or chicken to make a quick nutritious meal.

review/summary: All Sardines are Not Created Equal
review/text: I much prefer the taste of skinless sardines to tuna fish - they are milder and meatier and less "fishy".  Plus they lack the mercury content of tuna.  This has always been the brand I purchased at my Whole Foods store (for $2.79 per can), so I thought all sardines were pretty much the same.  My husband recently picked up two cans at the local Stop and Shop (King Oscar) and what a shock to my system.  For one, they still had the skin and TAILS on.  Two, the taste was more tinny than fish and the texture gritty.  I won't even open the other can.  Crown Prince quality and taste is far superior, and Amazon has them at a better price.

review/summary: Mild flavored, low-salt sardines
review/text: These low-salt, low-calorie sardines are a tasty source of supplemental protein. I like them straight with whole-wheat bread. Texture is firm and flavor is mild. Overall I prefer the Crown Prince canned salmon but these make for a nice change and are just the right size for lunches.

review/summary: Crown Prince Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Water
review/text: The sardines in the batch I purchased came from Morocco. These sardines while very tasty without any fishy taste (almost like eating tuna fish), were not firm and crumbled upon<br />removal from the can. This is a feature I do not like. The sardines should be firm and solid. It is because of this that I have downgraded the sardines. Even though a can contained 200 mg. of sodium the fish were not salty tasty.  There were five (5) fish in the first two cans I have used so far which I consider excellent.<br />The sardines were purchased from Amazon.com.

Now that amazon has raised the price to $50.65 a case or $2.03 each, it is not such a great deal anymore. That is a 23% increase in the price. Should have purchased this item in July, 2007 before Amazon decided to gouge it's customers. Oh Well!!

review/summary: Not as good as the ones packed in olive oil!
review/text: Maybe it's just that I almost always buy skinless and boneless sardines packed in extra virgin olive oil but I found these sardines packed in water to be really mushy and fishy tasting.  I love sardines but was very disappointed by the flavor and consistency of these sardines.  And they are not cheap either so I'll try to use them by adding mayonaise (lots of mayonaise) in a sandwich to help disquise the truly unpleasant taste.  I will NOT be buying these packed in water ever again!  I don't know if those packed in water but manufactured by other companies are of the same quality.  They were truly...... 'ughhhh'.  Maybe you are use to this taste and mushy texture...so please continue eating this really healthy food.  Sardines are the lowest member of the mercury absorption chain so are better for you than the contaminated tuna these days.  I just can't even think of eating these particular canned sardines straight from the can for a snack ever again.....just thinking about doing this makes me feel sick!

review/summary: I love these sardines
review/text: It's hard to get enough protein when you are training and eating 5 meals a day. chicken, shakes, eggs; they all get boring. It is nice to add variety with a can of sardines that taste great, have a decent level of protein and are portable. of course my friends at work are not too crazy with the smell so I am careful where I open them and how I dispose of the can afterwards. I bought there here because they are much cheaper than in the stores. I enjoy them on a hard cracker and a squirt of yellow mustard. Best looking sardines I've ever seen in a can. They have to be cause they are not all covered up with oil or any other sauces.

review/summary: Satisfactory: tasty and convenient
review/text: I used to use the Crown Prince sardines with the scales, and would clean off the scales under running water in the sink before eating them. These pre-cleaned ones taste probably about the same (that is, good), but are much more convenient. It's possible that the flavor is a little less sardiny, but since I can't make the direct comparison, it's difficult to say. Even if there is a small reduction in flavor, the greater convenience would outweigh the difference in my opinion.

review/text: I just couldn't get past the ick factor for sardines until I discovered skinless & boneless canned in water. These are now a staple in my pantry to provide a quick hit of protein in a salad or the star of a "tuna" salad for potluck dinners at church. For salads, I just add the water, too, to add more flavor and minimize the calories in dressing. I like knowing that sardines are sustainable and low in mercury, and this brand is delicious.

Use as you would canned tuna and this is a great option for using food as medicine, instead of taking fish oil supplements.

review/text: I ordered a bunch of these Haldiram snacks in different flavors.  This one is amazing!  We love the mint and the way it combines with the many other flavors and the crispy potato crunchiness.  These are a bit like piknik American potato "shoestrings"- but the flavor is so amazing!  minty, spicy, a little sweet (from the mango powder, I assume).  I immediately ordered 5 more bags.  These aren't going to last around my house with my teens.  None of my kids thinks these are too spicy- they are Much less spicy than fire cheetohs, for example- so don't be scared off by the inclusion of peppers in the seasoning blend.<br /><br />And they are good until 5/17/10- so not a whole lot of time to enjoy them, but at least they were not expired.

review/summary: Safe and healthful, and my choice of 'new' cat food to switch to
review/text: My cats are extremely fussy, one more than the other.  The more agreeable kitty was happy to switch to PetGuard...the other one needs a little encouragement, but I expected that.<br /><br />I am tired of worrying about what might be in the food I'm giving my pets, and I've been alarmed not only by the current pet food recalls, but also by the apparently low standards of consumer protection held by the mainstream mass-market industry.  So, I decided to switch to PetGuard.  Though, while making the switch, I will probably have to supplement it just a little with the cats' old favorites (Fancy Feast fish types) so they make the change-over smoothly.<br /><br />I've tried at least one other all-natural brand (I think it was Wellness) -- they wouldn't touch it.  Can't blame them -- it was smelly!  This pet food, the PetGuard, has no foul smell.<br /><br />I bought PetGuard dry food, too, and that is being received well.<br /><br />We have dogs...have switched their food, too, from Alpo to PetGuard, and they like it so far.  (To assist in the change-over to different wet food, I added a little bit of home-cooked chicken.)

Those also come with lots of liquid/oil etc in the can which happens to be BPA-free. These are dry and pasty and have very little fluid in the can. Also, I followed the link here from the Crown Prince website which advertises these as being packed in BPA-free cans. However, when they arrived I realized they weren't. I contacted Crown Prince about this and they basically said that amazon is selling an older stock in BPA-coated cans. I'm annoyed that they'd place a link on their site to "order now from amazon" and then when you order it is not the product advertised on their website. In my opinion, that is a very poor response from the company.

review/summary: my new favorite sardine
review/text: These are just great.  The fishy taste and odor is pretty mild. The texture is perfect. They have a nice smoked taste.  I usually eat sardines with mustard and hot pepper but these I eat right out of the can with nothing added. I tried these because of reading about pcbs in sardines and these young small ones should have less of that.  I was amazed at the small size of these.  In two cans one had 15 fish and the other had 17.  Amazing.  I'm stocking up on these while they're available.

review/summary: Sardines - yum!
review/text: Sardines are a terrific food source... high in protein and naturally high in fish oil (Omega 3 & 6); plust these are packed in quality olive oil. They're easily carried in your backpack (though, not easily, neatly eaten while on the go). Only concern is that occasionally, a can will be very salty - weird.

review/text: I think these are some of the best sardines I've ever had (barring the old style two-layer in sild sardine oil - does anyone pack them that way any more?).  There didn't seem to be any negatives with these.  They are small, tasty, and a great snack when you've just gotta have a good sardine and don't want those 3-to-a-can ones (you know, the ones that used to be 18 cents a can).  Would buy these again any day of the week.

Reading the nutrition facts,however, I was upset to learn that these sardines have 29% saturated fat and 23% cholesterol. Can I swap them for other sardines, at my expense. I was advised that the Brunswick sardines in spring water, with no salt added, are the prefered kind. I, again, accept the responsibility and will pay for additional cost.

Buying this is chaper than buying in the store as well, I think if you buy the same amount in the store you pay about 13 dollars more. Just be aware of the fact that you  need a can opener to open these cans.

review/summary: The Best Money can Buy for your Cat, Next to Homemade - Revised for Turkey
review/text: I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.

review/summary: difficult to review for a cat but...
review/text: The product seemed great from the human viewpoint: high protein, no grain, quality ingredients and relatively reasonably priced on Amazon. However, my cats would not touch the food. I have one, older female, slightly fussy part Maine coon and a second, very large young male, an outdoor stray who has adopted us. Neither of them would eat it, both preferred the dry food  (Wellness Salmon). I usually give them both wet and dry food. The wet food, a different brand, is always eaten first but this time, both bowls of Wellness Canned cat food were left pretty much untouched after the first taste and remained so until I tossed the food the next day! I know cats are very particular ...they often dislike something for no reason I can understand and it doesn't necessarily imply a faulty product ...  but if a young, hungry stray decides against it, in this case, I reckon something is off with the product.

Also as another reviewer said, this food doesn't have any of the crappy by-products that "Science Diet" and other highly marketed brands have. These brands even have by-products in their canned food.<br /><br />Cats are carnivores so the majority of their diet needs to be meat (aside from the small amount of veggies you might find in a mouse's or rabbit's stomach in the wild).<br /><br />Aside from that, my cat LOVES this food and it is very good for him. He eats a variety of flavors so he doesn't get sick of one.

review/summary: My cats love this stuff
review/text: I've been feeding my cats wellness since I weaned the stray kitten and got the shelter kitten, and they seem to like all the flavours plenty but I've been alternating this and the straight chicken stuff for the past few weeks and they've basically stopped eating the chicken stuff, I guess saving space for this stuff instead.

review/summary: Thie Best Money can Buy for your Cat, Next to Homemade - Revised
review/text: I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.<br /><br />Edit: I've added to the review after it appeared Product Not Available.  If you hit create review, THEN hit Edit review, apparently it takes.
