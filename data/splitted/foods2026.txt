review/summary: Love This Tea
review/text: It's organic, decaffeinated, individually wrapped (which makes it portable and keeps it fresh), flavorful and a good price. It's not easy to find that combination in local stores.  The aroma and taste of vanilla are just right in a hot cup of this tea.

review/summary: Excellent Decaf Tea!
review/text: I purchased this based on a great review here on Amazon.  I'm so glad 1st for the great review which caused me to purchase this delicious tea!  It is rather sweet all on it's own & the flavor is smooth.  The scent is decadant!  I tend to overbrew my tea to the extreme & this holds up to my crazy brewing without becoming bitter or funky!<br />I love that not only is this organic but fair trade as well.  A problem with organics these days is they really aren't organic.  They will contain "natural" flavors and/or one or more of the many non-organic allowed anyway ingredients that the USDA Organic certification says is okay.  Gee thanks...<br />Anyway, this tea does not contain that crap.  It is Naturally decaffeinated black tea (it doesn't use chemicals) with organic vanilla beans.  That's it.  Nothing else!<br />A smooth rich cuppa tea!  Fabulous with milk, like dessert!  Fabulous without milk too!  Perfect for taking to work since the bags are individually wrapped.

review/summary: mmmmm I love this stuff!
review/text: I got this for my husband who uses one of the old bar soaps known for leaving a "sticky soap film" behind.  He is a man of habit though and wouldn't use it even when I reminded him of the great commercial they had for the super bowl.  So, I hid his soap and left him with either this or puppy shampoo for his morning bath.  That did the trick! Not only that but this stuff has a really nice, subtle masculine scent.  mmmmmmmmm, I LIKE this stuff!  He smells sexy but not until you get really, really close, so I don't have to worry about the girls at work "sniffing after him".<br /><br />In the interest of writing a good review I did some additional research and used it on myself in the shower:  This product lathers nicely, and rinses very clean.  It does a good job of washing off sweat, dirt, grease, etc. without having to reapply.  After using it, I did not have dry or itchy skin and I felt clean and refreshed.  The scent was faint and kinda woodsy, it reminded me of sandlewood but very subtle.  While this product is for men, I would use it again. As for my husband, I hope he keeps using this -- did I mention? -- mmmm I LOVE the smell of this on him.

review/text: Dove Men + Care Clean Comfort Body Wash, 18-Ounces Bottles (Pack of 3)<br /><br />I've been using the Dove body wash for the past few weeks since I got it. I use the Axe Detailer with it, although Dove seems to have a similar product. It works well. It lathers up nicely has a pleasant, not too strong aroma and cleans effectively. Not much more I can ask from such a product. I saw from the Amazon page that you can save some money by subscribing to it. That's a good thing as it's a little bit pricey. But, it works well and I like it. I'll save one star for the high price but it earned the rest as a high quality product.

review/summary: A Nice Combination
review/text: When it comes to a body wash, I want something that's going to leave me clean and smelling better than I did when I took a shower.  But I don't want it to be so overpowering that other people flee the room when I enter.  I also want something that's on the masculine side of things and isn't overly floral.<br /><br />Enter the Dove Care for Men series.  I figured I'd give it a try and see how it works.<br /><br />So far, it's pretty good.  I swim laps a couple of times a week in a heavily chlorinated indoor pool.  So my first expectation is that the body wash would help remove that feeling of dryness and general chlorine-ness that can sometimes occur.  And it did that.<br /><br />The good thing is the dispenser on the top is large enough to get out enough but not so big that you're getting a ton more of the body wash then you need.  It allows for a greater degree of control and to use as little or as much as you need.  (I tend to err on the side of starting out with too little and getting more as needed rather than having too much).<br /><br />As for the scent, it's fairly subdued and not overpowering.<br /><br />A nice combination.

review/summary: Rather overpowering
review/text: Ok, to tell you the truth, after a read Mad Max's review, with a discussion of all the chemicals in this product, I am just a wee bit scared of this stuff. Are all these things necessary in something to bathe in?<br /><br />I have a couple of other issues with it as well. Personally, I thought the smell of it was very strong. Yes, I guess they want it to smell manly, but this stuff was rather overpowering.<br />Wouldn't it just be easier to make something with a very faint odor or no scent that perhaps the entire family could use and then if you would like to add a scent to oneself...aftershave or cologne or perfume, depending on ones gender, you could choose to do so. All these layers of scent seem just a bit much.<br /><br />And I also think the packaging is awkward.

review/text: I normally use Clearsil daily face wash(no I'm not 13, but yes I have oily skin), but I decided to give this product a try.  Overall I really like it.  While I personally like Clearisil because it really leaves your face feeling dry and clean, this is still a nice face wash.  It is more of a moisturizer when it comes down to it.<br />But I'd have to say that where the product really shines is the body wash aspect of it.  It is soothing, moisturizing, and has a really nice smell.  I recommend it.

review/text: Some products like this pour in the scent so that a person smells like they spilled the whole bottle in the bathroom, but not this product. I can still smell this scent on my husband for several hours but it is very light. This product says that it is for face and body but my husband uses it for shampoo also. It takes only a small amount for loads of suds.  Even though my water tends to be hard, it is still hard to get this product off and in fact needs to be gotten off with a wash cloth. Would recommend this product but maybe not if you have soft water.

review/summary: Not bad, but nothing special.
review/text: I've been using Dove for Men + Care Deep Clean Body Wash for two weeks now. There's really not a lot to say when reviewing body wash so I'll break it down briefly.<br /><br />I have not noticed a change in how soft my skin is or how moist/dry my skin is.<br /><br />The scent is masculine but not overpowering. I do not notice a lasting scent on my skin throughout the day.<br /><br />It works up a good lather.<br /><br />It says to use it as a face wash, however, I've noticed my face is oilier and I've had a couple breakouts on my forehead. This is not normal for me and wasn't the case until I switched from my Clean and Clear face scrub to this. I will discontinue using this as a face wash.<br /><br />This is all around a decent body wash. The price is cheap and it works as well as most anything else you'll find comparatively priced. I haven't noticed a positive change in my skin since using this product and have noticed a negative change to the skin on my face since using this product.

review/summary: Improvement over what I was using!---I like it.
review/text: I have been using a wash that comes in the green container, you know which one.  I've been satisfied with that product for a long time.  Had the opportunity to try Dove Deep Clean Body wash.  There is a big difference and I like it!  I find that I use a lot less, it makes a great lather and rinses off leaving a good clean feeling.  The scent is a great change, it is not strong but refreshing.  I know scents are subjective and we all like something a little different, I just happen to find this very pleasant.  I do live in a very dry area (Arizona), this seems to leave a bit of moisture on my skin, I just don't feel that dry skin feeling as before.  The container is easy to handle, the cap is on the bottom so it always is ready without doing a lot of bottle squeezing.  My wife has always used Dove products and is a big fan, this is true to form and certainly is not a let-down for me.  I must recommend this on my experience.  I know we all have different skin, preferences for smell, and expectations.  This suits me fine and an improvement over what I had been using.  Hope this will be a bit of help if you are thinking about purchasing Dove for men.

review/summary: Nice smell, comparison to Nivea for Men, Softsoap SPA...
review/text: Summary: Main difference from other body washes seems to be the nice smell that lingers more than other body wash.  For better moisturizing I'd recommend Softsoap Spa Moisture Wrap.<br /><br />"Dermatologist recommended, Micro Moisture for total skin comfort, Clinically proven to fight skin dryness??"  Maybe, but I couldn't really tell anything different.<br /><br />I have been using Softsoap SPA (Exfoliating Sea Salt and Moisture Wrap Essential Oil) and also had a new bottle of Nivea For Men Sensitive body wash.<br /><br />I tried these for a few days - using one body wash on the left and another on the right side of my body to see if I could tell any them apart.  The main difference is that the Dove has a pleasant smell.  Not overpowering.  Fresh out of the shower my wife thought I smelled nice.  as a result I don't think she'd use this body wash as it definitely is a "guy" scent.<br /><br />The Nivea smells nice but the smell won't linger on you after you rinse.<br /><br />As far as moisturizing, it's winter and very dry.  I wasn't able to see any significant difference between the Dove Men and the Nivea for Men products.  However, the "Moisture Wrap" version of the Softsoap SPA body wash definitely left my body feeling like there was something going on - kind of the difference between using a conditioner in your hair and not.<br /><br />If you've found this review helpful or have questions/comments, please let me know!

review/summary: Dove Men Body Wash
review/text: Finally a Body Wash for a Man.  This bottle opens from the bottom and only comes out when the bottle is squeezed.  Lathers up quickly and leaves a clean feeling on skin. Not harsh on or drying of skin.  Rinses off easy, does not have a soapy film feeling that's left behind after rinsing off.  Leaves a light clean scent, not offensive or girly smelling.  Skin does feel healthier after about a week of use.  Safe to use all over including on sensitive dry skin.  My son (10) uses it as well, he wants to have his own bottle. :)  Since your skin is your largest organ, makes sense that you keep it healthy.  Women have been doing it for years.  Makes sense that a product like Dove Men + Care is geared towards a mans skin care needs.  Great Product!!! A+

review/summary: Clean and Moisturize Without Oily Slickness and Overpowering Fragrance
review/text: Like many older adults, I have found that many bath soaps dry my skin.  During the Winter months, in particular, I've often needed to apply skin lotion after bathing to prevent itching even though I used a so-called "moisturizing bar" for my showers.  Liquid body washes for women are often oily and have a strong perfume smell.  They can also make a shower floor or tub slippery and dangerous.<br /><br />For more than a week, I have been using this product for my showers and have enjoyed the result.  I wet a washcloth, squirt a glob of gel about the size of a finger joint into the washcloth and then have enough lather to wash my face and body.  The fragrance is mild and masculine and the lather rinses quickly and cleanly without leaving an oily residue or slickness on the shower floor.  One pleasant result is moist skin and no itch, even though we're still having cold northeastern Winter days.<br /><br />This product, when used properly, shouldn't cost more than Dove men's bars and you won't need to do much rubbing to get a nice lather once the gel is applied to your washcloth.  As long as I continue to get the same results, I'll probably reorder this product and continue using it.  It's certainly worth a try for men who are looking to improve their bathing experience.

I'm careful about using body wash as my skin gets irritated by some.  The Dove body wash actually cleared up my skin and dry areas.  Even my hands feel less dry.<br />One things that is convenient about the Dove bottle is that the lid is on the bottom and opens/closes easily.  The product is always right there and easy to get to.

It doesn't smell too girly.  It doesn't smell too manly (think sweat covered with musk). It's thick enough, but not too thick that it's hard to rinse clean.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Dove products because my wife enjoys them, and I've tried some of their hand soap offerings.  If you want a manly way to get clean, this is a great option.

review/text: The "Dove for Men" body wash has a nice feel - it lathers lightly, has "microbeads" that help clean the skin, and I did not find it to have a heavy fragrance.  The smell was somewhat reminiscent of a man's cologne, but light. I am sensitive to strong fragrances, so this was a benefit to me.  I do note that some reviewers have different opinions about the scent, however.  Lastly, the product contains moisturizers.  I did find that my skin felt smooth, and the Dove wash did not leave a film or feel slimy.  I liked it.

review/summary: Dove Understands Men
review/text: My husband's first reaction after using this body wash was, "It's unexpectedly gritty."  He said the smell was just okay, though I loved how it smelled on his skin.  Very manly and enticing.  Then he went on a trip and I tried it myself (I didn't want to smell like a man while he was home; this stuff has a *very* distinctly masculine scent) so I'd have firsthand knowledge of its performance.<br /><br />After the getting past the somewhat poorly designed cap (hard to open), the grittiness was the first thing *I* noticed, too.  I've often used various exfoliating scrubs, so the experience is not unknown to me, but I somehow felt that this stuff would not actually do anything but uselessly scratch the skin.  I used it on my face, which I found uncomfortable, and despite taking great care, I felt like I got some grit in my eyes.  And the smell was absolutely overpowering.<br /><br />I usually apply body lotion after showering, but I didn't this time so I could evaluate the product's moisturizing ability.  My skin felt kind of tight and irritated, especially my face, but this passed after a while (except for on my hands and feet, which seemed to be much more dried out than they are after showering with my regular soap, currently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R961M0">Dove Cool Moisture Beauty Bar</a>).  In places (such as my shoulders), I noticed that the body wash had left a waxy residue.<br /><br />Then my husband came home and tried it again.  This time he said he *likes* the grit, and he reported that it did not cause him any irritation anywhere (even on sensitive parts).  And he said he really likes that it easily washes off very well (a perception I didn't share).  He still likes the scent, but he (unbelievably!) said he prefers something with a stronger scent (he uses <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019ZB62Q">Zest Body Wash Shower Gel, Aqua Pure</a>) to get him going in the morning.  He likes this enough to continue using it, but when he runs out, he said he'll go back to his regular body wash.<br /><br />Overall, I would personally give Dove Men + Care (awkward name, isn't it?) three stars, with the highlight being the scent.  But since I'm not the target market here, I'll give it what my husband voted, four stars.

So long as you don't mind having little pebbles in your body wash.  But I don't know that I would buy this just for that reason.  The smell is manly and doesn't last overly long.  I.e. you won't smell strongly for very long which is just as well.

review/text: I tried this product after using a few other 'Men's' body washes when I didn't want to smell like a fruit or a flower. After tiring quickly of the 'sport scent' types, this was a refreshing change, pun intended. This is a more wood/exotic scent. Still a bit sporty, but not in the surfer dude way, more in the (dare I say) sexy way. I didn't find it overpowering, and the scent is compatible with an oriental or wood cologne. I think the only citrus it would work with is a bergamont scent. Lathers nicely. Great for a woman in the winter months, and for a man all year long.

review/summary: Too gritty to be a moisturing facial wash
review/text: My first impression is that the scent is nice. It's a clean soapy scent but not as strong as Irish Spring or some of the other men's body washes out there.<br /><br />The problem is that it is way too gritty/grainy.  For a body wash whose description focuses on moisture and "skin comfort" and is also meant for use on your face, I was a little surprised that it was so abrasive.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good exfoliant it might be a good choice but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is looking for a moisturizing facial wash that promotes skin comfort.  I think the product description/marketing is all wrong.  Had I been looking for a super clarifying exfoliant I think I would have been pleased.

review/summary: Nice product - inconvenient bottle
review/text: I normally prefer to use bar soaps in the shower as I find that most gels don't go very far and I end up using half of a bottle of soap in one shower.  However, this soap foams quite a bit and goes really far - one dab will do you, as the old commercial used to say.  The soap is clean, fresh-smelling and works well.  The scent is not overpowering (my other fear about this product before I tried it)... it's subtle and quite nice.<br /><br />Now, for the only downside... the bottle.  The top of the bottle is curved so it's impossible to stand it on the other end. Why, might you ask, would you want to do that.  The bottom of the bottle is where the product comes out.  Picture yourself in the shower... you've just squeezed out some soap and you need both hands to lather up so you want to put it down MOMENTARILY.  If you could rest it on its top (which, since the product comes out on the bottom actually is like the bottom of a normal bottle), you could then easily access more product if you need it.  However, since you can't rest it on the top because the top is curved, you have to close the bottle, turn it upside down, and then put it down, three steps.  If you want more product, you have to pick it up and then open the bottle again.  Sounds like a small detail, but when you're late for work and just trying to get a quick shower, who wants all these acrobatics with a bottle?  Just poor design and not well-thought through but it's a new product on the market and I'm sure they will correct this going forward.<br /><br />I'm sure a marketing person somewhere "pitched" the top of the bottle as echoing the shape of the classic Dove soap bar (not to be confused with the chocolate Dove bar...)  and therefore suggested its curve.  Clearly they didn't actually take a shower with this bottle.<br /><br />In summary, excellent product, with packaging that needs a change.  Hope this is helpful!

review/summary: Much Better
review/text: My husband said he preferred using this over the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TSA916">Dove Men Clean Comfort Body Wash</a>. He said it had more lather, and the exfoliation left his skin feeling cleaner to him. He thought the scent was about the same between the two products, but it wasn't as overpowering as something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MASTQU">Axe Revitalizing Shower Gel</a>.<br /><br />Even though our family uses other Dove products like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET7KC2">Dove Shampoo</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET7IQK">Dove Soap</a>, this is the first Dove men's product that my husband really liked.

review/summary: Good Soap, Bad Marketing...
review/text: Dove soap makes me think of gentle soap for ladies and babies. Calling it Dove Men+Care Clean Comfort does little to dispell this idea, especially considering how prominently the gentle dove logo is displayed. Yet I put aside my manly pride and decided to give it a try...<br /><br />Using the soap was a new experience. The soap itself is a weird pale blue color, and rather thin. When you start the lathering process, you will find it doesn't really produce a lot of lather, which is a little disappointing. Now, this is compared to the lather of New AXE Snake Peel Shower Scrub - 12 oz which I normally use. I am afraid the Dove Men+Care lather would take extra scrubbing when cleaning up after the weekend car maintenance. In fairness, I haven't tried it under really tough conditions, but I will update this review if I find out otherwise.<br /><br />The scent of the soap was weird, and I hated it at first. It smells a little flowery at times, and musky at others, but overall, the smell is really faint and hard to define. You can hardly smell it. It's a real contrast to those soaps that wake you up like smelling salts. Overall, the scent was ok to me, but the real judge was my wife. She has told me immediately after I started using this soap that I really smelled good. Mission accomplished.<br /><br />The "Micro-Moisturizing" aspect of this soap basically means that this soap forms a slick coating on your skin when you lather, which seems to be quickly absorbed by your skin or rinse off; then, after you dry off, your skin is left a little less dry. I like this aspect, although I don't know that I would seek it out except in winter. These dry winter days leave your skin pretty scaly, and this soap helps a little bit.<br /><br />Overall, a good soap, but not a soap I would be likely to slip in the cart. My wife, however might, and if she did, I wouldn't be too disappointed. She likes my scent when I shower with it, and it makes my skin a little less scaly.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: A clean-feeling body wash that goes easy on the fragrance
review/text: Part of Dove's new men's skincare line, Dove Men + Care's Clean Comfort Body Wash lives up to its no-nonsense name.  The creamy, blue gel has a light, fresh fragrance that goes a long way in the lather department.  More importantly, it rinses off cleanly without leaving any oily residue behind, but doesn't leave the skin feeling too dry, either.  Best of all, the subtle residual scent left behind smells clean without being cloying, meaning it won't do battle with your cologne.

review/summary: Husband said "It was OK."
review/text: I selected this for my husband to try. He said there was barely any lather compared to other body washes that he's used. Lather doesn't necessarily make you any cleaner, but the lack of suds was a negative.<br /><br />The big positive was the scent. My husband doesn't like smelling like a piece of fruit, but I am very sensitive to strong scents (ex: perfume, cologne). Body wash scents like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MASTQU">Axe Revitalizing Shower Gel</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GR7KBO">Old Spice High Endurance Body Wash</a> trigger an allergic reaction in me. I'm happy to say that this men's body wash from Dove isn't too strong to be around, but my husband wasn't impressed with it -- he thought it didn't really have a distinguishing scent.<br /><br />Overall, it will get your man clean, but Dove hasn't really won us over with this one.

review/summary: Nice Soap
review/text: Overall a success in my book.  Nice aftershave smell, washes off easily, seems to have the Dove quality and performance intact.<br /><br />Packaging is good with a well designed container and "manly" look for those who feel their masculinity may be threatened by a bottle.  Did not have the manly Shower Tool to accompany my showering experience but it's nothing a loofah and scrunch couldn't handle.  Not too sure what "Micromoisture Technology" really is, though.  Water?  Olive oil?<br /><br />The price point seems a bit high but anyone who orders this product shouldn't be disappointed as long as expectations are in check.

review/summary: Too much perfume for me... cleans well though.
review/text: Not too much to add to the title. 3-stars cuz it works, no more cuz it's too smelly for my use. This seems like a product in search of a niche. I mean, soap works, right?<br /><br />My predominant shower soap is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E0VAUY">Clearly Natural Soap Glycerine Peppermint 4 oz ( Multi-Pack)</a> (and other "flavors"). I started using glycerin soap when I found out that it cleans as well as regular soap but doesn't leave soap scum to muck up the bath/shower. When I saw this as a choice on Vine, I thought, "What the heck? Give it a try. You can always clean off the scum."<br /><br />This product cleans well and leaves a slippery feeling to the skin (we have softened water) when rinsed off, but it leaves a very obvious aftershave-like smell: it actually work me up several times during the night the one-time I used it to shower with. So, no more showers with this for me! However, I am using it during the day to wash the old armpits. It really does clean and de-smellify well.<br /><br />Added after reading the previous reviews: there is a "technical problem" with the container. The lid is on the bottom and not easy to open when your hands are wet. Also, if you use it at the sink (like I do for my armpits), the stuff drips out when you open it - OK in the shower but not at the sink.

review/summary: Just like Dove Bar soap but in a bottle
review/text: I was expecting Dove Men + Care Clean body wash to be more "man" specific.  It seems like just plain Dove Soap in a bottle.  We use Dove Soap all the time and have always liked the soft and clean feeling it leaves my body feeling after a shower, but my son and husband call it "girly" soap and always opted for Axe or some other brand of "man" soap, although they are all very drying to their skin and I have to listen to them complain about dry winter skin.  When Dove Men came out I was thrilled that it would finally be more of the "man" soap they want with the  great Dove non itchy soap.  Well, it is definately still the great Dove soap, but it still can't compare with Axe as far as smell. It isn't quite up to the same cologne type smell that Axe or other brands made for men have. I give it 4 stars because Dove is a wonderful soap, and this is a bit more on the manly scent side, but not enough.  Some men don't like a strong smelling soap so this may be great for them, but unfortunately for my guys they want a stronger smelling cologne in their soap.

review/summary: I never thought I would like something like this.....
review/text: ....but I was WRONG. Wow! I am normally just a plain old soap kind of guy. I don't really care much for anything too smelly, and the body washes I have tried (received as a gift or used in a resort) have left me feeling that I would never want to try a body wash. Either I got hives (yes, that happened with H20 brand), or it just left a film. Well, Dove Men + Care is a different story. It smells good, not just nice, but really good....and my wife likes it, too, she said, "It has a manly smell." I'm not sure what that means, but it was said in a positive way, so that's good with me. It also rinses off easily, and my skin did actually feel softer without feeling filmy. As for the "smell," it's a crisp aroma, not musky and not woodsy. If you can imagine what "clean" ice would smell like (if there were such a thing), that is as close as I can get. It is not an overpowering aroma at all. Lastly, the container is perfect. It stands upside down very nicely and allows gravity to keep it at the dispensing end, which is great. As for value, well, I believe there is some value here. Each of these are fairly large, and should last for a while, so for the price, you are getting quite a lot. All-in-all, this is a winner!

review/summary: Great texture, Nasty smell
review/text: I love the smooth yet granular feel of this body wash. I do feel like it cleans well and I haven't had any of the negative reactions to it that others here have. What I dislike most about the product is that is really doesn't smell good, in my opinion. The fragrance is Old Spice-ish and I just don't like it. I feel like the fragrance is too chemically strong. The first time I used it I though, "I'd better not strike a match right after using the product" because literally it feels like you're covered in chemicals.

review/summary: Maybe I should wait a bit before reviewing this...
review/text: I've been using for a few days now and I don't really have any complaints about this product.  I have sensitive skin (have always had it) and so I'm always weary about how different products are going to affect my skin (positively or negatively) but I haven't had the issues that some of the other reviewers have had.  My skin has not broken out after use, and my skin does not feel dry at all, in fact with all this cold weather we've been having, my face especially feels better than it has in a while.  Like others have mentioned (even when complaining about other things), the soap lathers up great, washes off easily, cleanses nicely with the grains and it smells nice (nothing spectacular thought).<br /><br />I do have an issue with the chemical contents, but I have yet to see any adverse reactions to me or my family (and like one reviewer, I have a young daughter, but she hasn't broken out from exposure).  If something like this happens anytime soon, I'll be sure to amend my review with a cautionary blurp.<br /><br />One minor issue with the bottle itself is the cap.  It isn't the easiest to open when you're wet or cramped in the shower.  It doesn't have an easily `poppable' cap.  Like I said, minor issue.<br /><br />Like the other reviewers, I have always been a fan of Dove (sounds weird to say that I am a fan of soap, but they make good products and are really the only supplier of soap to our home).  At this point I'd recommend this, based on my own experience, but I'd also take into consideration the other reviews because every situation is different, and I may be singing a different song in a week or two.<br /><br />For now, I'm happy.

review/summary: Too drying
review/text: Dove Men+Care Deep Clean with Purifying Grains is one of those total body washes that is supposed to do everything except wash hair.  I have used other Dove bar soaps and found them to be fairly good at moisturizing the skin but not this product.  It tended to be too drying on my face.  That makes me not recommend this for anything but the body and even there it still strips out too much moisture.  If your skin isn't sensitive this maybe alright, but with all the patent filled ingredients inside it just isn't the claimed "total skin comfort."  On the positive side its' scent isn't overpowering but this isn't something that would make me buy it very often or at all.  Not recommended for any sensitive skin types.

review/summary: Miracle...READ
review/text: The simplicity of this product! These days skincare products are jam-packed with different ingredients to add this benifit or that benefit to your skin (you name it), BUT those ingredients really don't make a difference. While this product does have a scent and I don't know about the micromoisture effect it claims (might need to work on the labeling), it does one thing phenomenally well; cleanse your skin without overdrying it.<br /><br />Okay there are some game changers...Vitamin A (Retinol or Retinyl Palmitate) can effectively speed cell turnover. Glycolic Acid and Salicylic Acid are Beta Hydroxy Acids that increase cell turnover too (exoliating by penetrating the skin). So there are those active ingredients which promote exfoliation...BUT the reality is you don't really need to have that flaky dry, plastered feeling everytime you want to cleanse. Everyone wants a scrub or deep clean "rich" lather. BUT that is what's wrong with 100% of face washes out there. You are simply damaging the outer surface of your skin and breaking down it's defense barrier similar to using an imbalanced PH product (Sebamed scientifically proved that). The answer all lies within one ingredient, one that Sebamed never discovered. One we've been told never to use!<br /><br />Petrolatum. Unlike other emollients like alcohol derived ingredients (glycerin, glycol etc), Petrolatum doesn't sink into your skin it only sits on top protecting your skin. In a wash the Petrolatum keeps detergents like SLS from penetrating and damaging your skin's hydrating lipid barrier. As a result you have clean skin that has remained well hydrated due to the fact that all of the water, chemicals like chlorine, air pollution, and harmful UV rays have not penetrated your skin. It doesn't make much difference how much bottled water you drink if you take 2 showers a day in chemicals. Your skin is your largest organ and it absorbs too many bad things already. Protect it! Makes sense right!!!! FINALLY A SKINCARE COMPANY FIGURED IT OUT...EUREKA! (I'm not talking bout the vaccum) YOU DON'T NEED TO USE "NATURAL" OILS which aren't natural because they aren't naturally part of your skin (with the exception of squalane, still wouldn't be natural unless it was already there). They make 1)people break out 2) sticky skin 3) unbearable shine. And as for all of those moisturizers what's actually beneficial about them? You are just trying to draw moisture out of the air and into your skin making it HEAVY and WET that is GROSS and definately going to have a DRYING EFFECT on your skin over the long run! Take charge! Simplify your life and beautify your skin by not destroying it.

review/summary: Good but not moisturizing enough
review/text: Knowing this is Dove for Men I had to compare the ingredients with Dove. And lo and behold the ingredients differ, but not in a good way. What I noticed is that one of the first ingredients is a "sodium lauryl sulfate" which is used for foaming. Unfortunately it does this at the expense for moisturizing. Dove is supposed to be moisturizing - remember those commercials bragging about 1/4 moisturizing. Yeah not so in this case. But I guess for men means you just want a good scent. Well at least it has a masculine scent.<br /><br />I much prefer the Neutrogena exfoliating body scrub. It has a masculine scent, provides moisture and exfoliates.<br /><br />But I digress. The Dove for men line is ok, good for those who don't care for moisture and appreciate a good scent (Axe anyone)?<br /><br />3 out of 5 stars for the scent and suds.

review/summary: Smells nice, but leaves you dirty
review/text: I'm typically a bar soap kind of guy, Irish Spring or Dial depending on the day. I got some of this to try though and I was pretty stoked. It smelled all manly and stuff; my girlfriend seemed to enjoy the scent as well.<br /><br />Let's just say the enjoyment didn't last long. This junk makes me feel like I have a film on me when I leave the shower. I figure it's all moisturizing or whatever, so that was ignored. What bugs me though, is that I can't make it past 5pm without feeling completely disgusting. My taint gets all tainty and before I know it, my day is ruined and I still have 5 hours to go. I could take another shower, but I'm a busy guy.<br /><br />Here's to switching back to bar soap. I feel clean all day and smell clean, not manly, but at least clean. That's enough for me, I'll wear cologne if I want to smell like what society has deemed 'manly'.<br /><br />Summation: This stuff leaves you gross and dirty. Major Fail.

review/summary: Slight discount, Great product
review/text: This body wash was recommended to me by my dermatologist - as part of a regiment for both acne and eczema. Now, I can see why it was recommended. By far, this is the best body wash I've ever used. I've tried many brands - Old Spice, Axe, plain Dove bar soap. All over dried my skin or irritated. This one doesn't, and also hasn't caused any breakouts, and hydrates my skin. Thanks in part to this body wash my skin is in amazing condition.<br /><br />This pack was only slightly discounted as compared to buying in store, but with shipping options and other items bought at the same time it was a steal. I can only ever find this size bottle at Target; with 'Subscribe and Save' discount on top of a dollar discount coupon from Amazon, this was a steal.<br /><br />Quality outer box and quality sealed plastic in side...almost seems wasteful to double package...but regardless, quality in every department.

review/summary: Soap is Soap, Nothing Special
review/text: The soap cleaned my body without irritation, so I guess it did it's job.  But I expected more from a product that costs more than my Suave shampoo ($1.47/bottle).  I just don't see the point in spending more on a product that does the same thing.  It didn't do it any better, and it didn't smell better (in fact, I like the variety of scents that Suave offers).  But it did the job and it isn't a ton more, so I only took off one star for not living up to my expectations.  I think this product hooks people on the idea that it is just for men, like it's some sort of secret club or something.  Soap is soap, if a woman uses this product she'll get the same results.  I don't know, it just seems like false advertising to play on people's insecurities.  Perhaps I'm just in a cynical mood...

It's simpler and, well, cleaner. It doesn't leave a slippery feel on the tub floor like most body washes do. And most deodorant soaps give a fresher smell and wash off more thoroughly.<br /><br />I'll keep using it for a while and see if it gets better than this, otherwise I'll just stick with a mediocre 3 star rating.

review/summary: It's Soap, I'm Clean, and It Makes My Skin Feel Nice
review/text: As I get a bit older, my skin does not seem to hold up so well to the cold dry winters anymore.  Since I hit my 30's, I usually use Dove Moisturizing Body Wash (if you are like me, I refer it to Dove in the white bottle) and to be honest, I have had lackluster results with it.  It helps quite a bit, but it never seemed to do a great job of moisturizing.<br /><br />I agreed to try Dove Men + Care (I guess this will be dubbed Dove gray) and to be honest, expected similar results.<br /><br />After using it for a few days, I have to say my skin does feel better than with the standard Dove in the white bottle.  The dry, burning, itchiness feeling I get in winter really seems to have diminished.<br /><br />The scent that it leaves behind is pretty long lasting and is what I would describe as a musky scent.  Strangely, what my skin smells like after I wash and what the soap smells like in the bottle do not seem to have the same scent to me.  My wife calls the scent nice (she is the most important judge after all), but I thought it was just so-so.  The scent is not bad and is nothing I would find embarrassing, I just was not overly impressed by it.  I do like the fact that the scent lasts a lot longer than other body washes I use.  I think it lasts quite a bit longer than Old Spice High Endurance body wash.<br /><br />Also to me a big improvement over Dove white is the lather.  The Dove in the white bottle does not have a great lather, but Dove Men + Care is easy to lather up in a pouf and a little soap seems to go a long way.<br /><br />The only thing I really did not like about the product was the name.  Minor point, but I think Dove Men + Care is too wordy.<br /><br />Overall, I do like how this makes my skin feel after only a few days.  Most likely, this will be my new "winter" body wash as I really did like how it makes my skin feel.

Dove's latest Care Deep Clean Body Wash for men features a good fragrance, not so overpowering.  Also, a clean body wash from a reputable brand.<br /><br />Opening for the bottle is at the bottom and didn't experience any of the body washing running out.  You also get a lot for 18-ounces.  Also, it does include the exfoliating particles that is important, in my opinion for a body wash.<br /><br />Overall, it does the job, smells great and it all comes down to price. If you see a good deal for the pack of three or individual, definitely give it a try!

After touching her face to mine, the chemicals must have transferred.<br /><br />I normally read ALL ingredients of everything I use (laundry detergent, soaps, hand soaps, etc). But this was a new product, it was by Dove (I assumed they had higher standards), and I only tested it on a small area (my face & upper body).<br /><br />I'm so confused because Dove is the company that advertised gentle formula, pure ingredients, etc. But why are there so many malicious chemicals included in this product?<br /><br />* DIOXANE is a known chemical carcinogen (aka Sodium Laureth Sulfate, the first ingredient here)<br /><br />* PETROCHEMICALS petrolatum (second ingredient), derived from crude oil. As you would expect, it fills in your pores and doesn't allow skin to breathe.<br /><br />* ACRYLATE COPOLYMER is a synthetic polymer (plastic) which also comes from crude oil - highly processed, creates toxic by-products.<br /><br />* COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE  - known to irritate the skin, and cause allergic reactions in some people.<br /><br />* FRAGRANCE - sounds simple, but perhaps the most dangerous ingredient here. Due to deregulation, they are not legally bound to tell us what's really in it! Almost always contain phthalates,  chemicals commonly used to stabilize shampoos and liquid soaps, But they are "endocrine disrupters" which mimic hormones and may alter genital development, especially in little boys! When put in the lakes or streams, this chemical will cause male frogs and salamanders to turn into females!<br /><br />* POLYETHYLENE - also a Dioxane.<br /><br />* DMDM Hydantoin - preservatives that have the potential to release formaldehyde in very small amounts. Causes contact dermatitis, perhaps what caused the rash in my daughter's face after touching my skin.<br /><br />Simply put, it's RIDICULOUS that something as simple as soap contains KNOWN cancer-causing chemicals, and other insane chemicals that aren't safe!! And, why are we the only industrialized country in the world without laws to protect consumers and children?<br /><br />Many products, including some top-selling Johnson & Johnson products, are banned in Europe because of unsafe ingredients ... but shouldn't we have the highest standards of everybody? Why do we have the ~lowest~ standards?<br /><br />And, isn't it ridiculous that something as simple as soap is so politicized? Unilever (owns Dove & Axe), Proctor & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson each donate millions of dollars to politicians so they can continue putting unsafe ingredients in our products. Thank God we have politicians (on both sides of the aisle) to take their money and look the other way.<br /><br />Dove, please clean up your act.

review/summary: UPDATED::it is the real deal now
review/text: ::::::UPDATED 9/8/2012:::::::: No longer fake solution being used. Real thick solution now::::::::Read below original comment.<br /><br />The 3 pack of Dove for Men Liquid Soap was opened already and was far more liquidy then the store bought brand. Normally this soap is much thicker, but the soap available on Amazon seems to have a thinner viscosity(like someone added water to it). It's like someone took 1-2 bottles and added water to them to make them fit into 3 bottles. The 3 pack I received had Skotch clear tape holding the lids on and I believe if this wasn't on the thin formula that Amazon provides of this Soap would more than likely leak out if this wasn't done. This soap isn't cheap and the 3 pack sounds like a deal, but when you get it you'll realize why. By buying it on Amazon you save some money, but your getting screwed since the soap is not the original Dove for Men formula, but instead a much more watered down version of this soap. A real disappointment!<br /><br />:::::UPDATE::: After running out of the water downed Dove for Men 3 pack I had, I decided to give Amazon one more try.  Since a year has passed and the price is amazing, I figured I'd see if the solution was still a problem and I can gladly say it's now the real thing. The Dove for Men solution they are now using is the same thick solution you can find in stores. Thanks for fixing this Amazon.

review/summary: those little grains
review/text: I have to take away two stars simply for the "cleansing grains" that are an ingredient in this product.  I don't mind the feel of these micro-grains on my body.  But, this cleanser is a body AND face cleanser and personally I just don't like the feel of the grains on my face.  Putting aside the issue of the grains, I really do like the product.  It is a pretty luxurious detergent with obvious moisturizers that feel nice on the body.  It has a very pleasant smell and rinses well.  I feel very CLEAN after using this wash.  I only wish they  (and maybe they will) offered a "grain free" version of this cleanser.  I would buy it.  And if the little grains don't bother you then this is a top drawer product, for sure.

review/text: I barely get acne on my body. It does happen on my face occasionally.<br /><br />Guess what?<br />After using this Body Wash for a week, I started having acne all over my body.<br />Well, I did some research and the cause seems to be the petrolatum ingredient thats in this Body Wash. (All Dove Men+Care Body Wash products contain petrolatum.)<br /><br />I strongly recommend sticking to Dove Men+Care soap. From my knowledge, those are petrolatum free.<br />If you are not a soap person, I recommend giving Irish Spring Moisture Blast a try. That's one of my favorites.<br />Gillette is also a good brand as well.<br /><br />Once again, Dove Men+Care is only a good brand when it comes to soap.

review/summary: Finally, a great body wash for men
review/text: The first thing I noticed was the fresh musky scent. It was refreshing but not overpowering. The viscosity of the body wash was thinner than what I'm used to, but it lathers up nicely even without using a scrubber. The microbeads aren't large enough to feel like sand in your eyes or be large enough to hurt your feet when you step on them. However, I still don't recommend getting any of the wash into your eyes as it will sting!<br /><br />The wash was easy to use and it rinses off without leaving a greasy feeling, yet it does not leave a dry feeling either.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to use, great scent that isn't overpowering, cleans very effectively<br /><br />Cons: None<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars

review/summary: Great body wash!
review/text: The most appealing aspect of Men+Care Clean Comfort Body Wash for me is that it manages to avoid the Old Spice/Brylcreme definitions for men's products without sliding down the metrosexual path.  It has a very agreeable scent that I like, and one that met with compliments (or more importantly, a lack of "what is that..." type) comments from my lovely wife.<br /><br />I've used body washes that produced more lather, however this one just might be the best moisturizing soap I've used.  Perhaps there is something to the "micromoisture" technology, though I tend to look askance at newly coined phrases like that.<br /><br />Cheapskate so and so that I am, I appreciate the design of the bottle.  It's flat on the cap, so that you can always open it from the bottom without having to flail about to get those last few drops of soap.  Also, you don't have to worry about it falling off the shelf mid-shower, because the bottle's center of gravity has been disrupted by turning it upside down.<br /><br />Nice job Dove!  I'll be using this for a long time to come.

review/summary: A body wash you won't have to turn in your man card for.
review/text: Soap is soap.  At least that's what I thought.  Frankly, I could care less about what soap I had used in the past.  Bar, body wash, whatever was available, I'd use it.  Maybe I'm in the minority here, but my biggest goal in the shower as a guy was to see how quickly I could get out.  Speed is the name of the game in the shower for me...no 5, 10 or 15 minute showers.  Get in and get out.  Just like at the mall.<br /><br />However, this body wash may have me extending my shower time.  It smells good, not "nice" but good.  Not manly per se, but not girly either. It lathers quickly and holds the suds.<br /><br />Now for the kicker.  I live in a dry climate and would always have to use lotion on my hands by the time I had gotten to work.  I haven't had to use it since I've been using this body wash!  Great news for me as I can kill two birds with one stone.<br /><br />All in all, I really could care less about my shower routine and how I smell coming out.  However, if this stuff keeps me from having to use lotion on my hands afterwards, then that just might make me keep on using it.<br /><br />And I can keep my man card in my wallet for now.

review/summary: I am not sure whether men need this...
review/text: I am not sure whether many men would use "Dove + Men Care Clean Comfort Body Wash." At least for me (a middle aged & married man), I am used to just washing my body with a bar of soap. Sure, sometime, it does dry up my skin, but after the shower, I do at times put on a lotion to soothe dry skin. As for this product:<br /><br />1. While the product promises, "(its) micromoisture technology to fight skin dryness," I have not seen any difference between using a bar of Dove soap or even Lever 2000. Even after using Dove's Men Care, I still needed to put on some of lotion to soothe my skin.<br />2. The scent of the item is somewhat like aftershave smell. Some men might like it, others may not. However, the scent is not too strong, but mild.<br />3. I do not know how clean it cleanses my body. I really can't tell the difference.<br /><br />Overall, I am not sure whether it is better than simple bar of soap.

review/summary: It's soap... For men!
review/text: In recent years, there's been a boom in the "for men" category of personal hygiene products. I guess the companies figured we guys were sick of seeing women get special soaps, shampoos, razors, deodorants and skin treatments, and sought to narrow the gap by giving us men something to claim for our own. Give it another decade and there may not be any unisex products in the personal care aisles anymore!<br /><br />And what's to review here? Soap. Fine, fine, fine-- Call it "Body Wash" if you want, but that's just the long-hand for "soap". Some marketing wizard decided to differentiate soap for your hands from soap meant for the rest of your body (but not your hair) as a means to get us to buy the same product twice. For the record, this soap works on your hands just as well as it works on your butt.<br /><br />It smells nice, like a typical men's deodorant or low-cost cologne. No fruity sweetness here! We're MEN (grunt!) If we can't smell like grease and dirt, then we like to smell like chemicals, not flowers or fruit! So this gets a good grade in the olfactory category.<br /><br />It gets me clean. Dirt was there, and now it's gone. My butt has never been shinier (except for that incident with the oil and the floor buffer). It makes me feel clean too, so I know it's not a mere illusion. LO, I AM NOW APPROACHABLE!<br /><br />Supposedly this soap has long-term effects on my skin, and makes my epidermis more healthy because there are little exfoliating beads in the soap. I'm not sure I can verify that, because I haven't run a long-term test course, but I'll take their word for it. After all, being clean has health benefits in and of itself.<br /><br />There's really no reason to complain about this product. It's a good soap. It comes in a nice squeeze bottle that makes it easy to lather up. It doesn't smell like wet dog or old spinach. It makes me cleaner than I would be if I didn't use soap, and it even works on my hands (despite the conspiracy to get me to buy separate hand soap!) so what else do you want in a soap? Tyler Durden-style lipo fats? A keen chemical burn? You won't get that here!<br /><br />But you will get clean, and you might get some action if you no longer smell like a soiled goat covered in Cheetos dust. That makes it SO worth it.

review/text: My husband uses Dove body wash products regularly so I ordered this product for him to sample.  He thought it was a fair/good product --lathered well, smelled good, overall good feeling.  However, he wasn't impressed by it enough to want to spend two or three times as much for this item as compared to other similar items on the market.  Additionally the product's grainyness while fine for the body wasn't a good idea on the face...especially if one shaved before or after using.  Overall a nice product but not necessarily one that he has to have or purchase.

review/summary: Clog Your Pores, Stay Dirty, Feel Stale
review/text: This is the worst body wash I have ever used and I have used a few (from most regular mass market products like Axe, Old Spice to designer brands like Armani, Dunhill). The things that I expect from a bodywash/shower gel are:<br /><br />1) It should clean you very well and leave you feeling fresh (BUT while doing so it should not dry your skin). In the long run it should be good for the skin.<br /><br />2) It should not have any ingredient which is harmful for the skin. Specifically I avoid the following like plague: Petrolatum, Parben, Mineral Oil (apart from these, I also try to avoid SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate) but it is hard to find a body wash or shower gel without SLS - its pervasive).<br /><br />3) Have a good soothing or invigorating fragrance (while not being so strong as to cause a headache)<br /><br />Before beginning this review let me tell you why I avoid the ingredients Petrolatum, Parben and Mineral Oil - all these ingredients, in the name of 'moisturizing your skin by locking in vital moisture' actually form a sheath on top of your skin and clog its pores. This is extremely unhealthy for the skin since skin, for being healthy, needs to be able to breathe freely for expelling impurities out of the system. The implication of using products (body washes, shower gels) with these ingredients is that you do not feel as fresh after the shower (compared to products  without these ingredients) since your skin pores are clogged and suffocated. Though I noticed that this Dove Men + Care Clean Comfort Body Wash contained Petrolatum (and SLS), I wanted to give it a try since I hold in high regard Unilever in general for their well engineered products and the Dove brand in particular for their moisturizing bar soap which is one of the best soaps for skin and is a fantastic product.<br /><br />However I was shocked when I used this. It is the worst of all worlds - This body wash almost does not clean you at all but leaves such a heavy residue on your skin that you will feel horrible - as if you did not have a shower at all. And dare you use this when you are a little more unclean than usual - when you come out of the shower you will wonder whether you had a shower at all. There is absolutely NO feeling of freshness OR cleanliness that you expect from a shower. Now some might argue that usually 'moisturizing' body washes are intended more to moisturize than to leave you feeling squeaky clean - well I'm not talking of anything even close to squeaky clean here - when you have a bath (even if it were with the world's most moisturizing soap/body wash) you expect to feel a minimal level of freshness (otherwise there is no point of a bath - you might as well smother yourself with moisturizing lotion instead).<br /><br />Ok - so this does a horrible job of cleaning. So what about its claims of moisturizing ? The only thing this body wash does is clog your pores and leave your skin feeling suffocated - not supple and well cared for. So if you have an oily skin or if you are a little stale from perspiration and get into the shower with this, you will feel horrible since this will 1) not clean you in any way 2) lock in the dirt that you had before the shower - can you imagine how bad that can feel ? I wonder whether this product was well tested on actual people (which is a basic requirement and the norm with any cosmetic manufacturer of credibility/repute) before being rolled out.<br /><br />As for the fragrance, its just OK. Nothing that you would look forward to.<br /><br />I'm thoroughly disappointed with Unilever for releasing such a badly engineered and tested product. This is extremely uncharacteristic of this very good FMCG company. I threw this in the bin after using it thrice (I was disgusted after the very first use but wanted to give this a chance just in case the first day was a 'bad bath day' - but alas the bad was not in the day - it was in the gel).<br /><br />Well this review was a passionate one and so could come across to some as bordering on the weird - for after all its a body wash isn't it ? Your life does not depend on it. But well, I am very particular about the decisions I make for my health, grooming and well being. This product was so horrible that it disgusted me to the extent necessary to elicit such strong feelings of dislike and disapproval. However, as I always suggest, do not take my word for it - try this yourself (if you want) with an open mind but at the same time being conscious of what to test/look for after reading this review - because after all you are the best judge of what suits you and what is good for you. Also, I strongly suggest that you try to find a cleaning product without SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate), since SLS penetrates the skin and even the internal organs easily and can cause havoc like endocrinological imbalances, neurological disorders, organ toxicity and cancer on long term use.

review/summary: Good body wash - refreshing, but lacking
review/text: I have sensitive skin that is prone to getting dry, particularly during the winter months and dry weather. I thought I would give this new line a try and it was alright. The scent is just right as it is not overpowering but definitely detectable, although I can understand some people being turned off by it.<br /><br />The primary moisturizing ingredient in this body wash is the same as in many others - petrolatum. Those saying that this body wash does not moisturize enough - I would recommend letting the lather set on your body for at least a minute or two. Petrolatum is not an instantaneous moisturizer and needs some time to settle on the skin to do its job. Try aiming the water off of you as you lather and let it set for a couple of minutes. Even with this technique, however, this body wash just isn't as moisturizing as it says, especially in comparison to Dove 'Deep Moisture'.<br /><br />Overall - I liked this body wash. I'm rather picky with my personal hygiene products and Dove For Men passes with an average score.

review/summary: Clean feeling and refreshing
review/text: Normally I use Irish Spring soap but noticed recently that it has been drying my skin out during the winter months. The Dove Men Body and Face Wash works great so far, cleans especially good as a face wash. I like that its a combination body and face wash, for a guy its very convenient not having to use multiple products. I tried two of the three scents. The Clean Comfort has a clean and cool scent to it (Coolwater'ish). The Extra Fresh has a fresh lemon type of scent to it. I like both, clean out of the shower smell but not overpowering like the usual cheap drugstore stuff. Best face cleanser Ive used and will continue using, highly recommended.

review/summary: Dries out skin, causes heavy irritation, hard to undo its affects
review/text: This product seemed very good at first and at first, i loved it. However, around 2 months after using it, i discovered i was always itching my outer thigh and the area directly behind my armpits (i was using the new dove deodorant also) was getting very dry (something very uncommon for me because my skin rarely dries out). After changing my body wash and deodorant (about 3 weeks later) my symptoms are beginning to leave. This product is very harmful to your skin and it doesn't manifest its negative consequences until it's too late. The dry skin is almost impossible to get rid of and even now (almost 2 months after i stopped using this product), my itchy skin is still evident. I went to my dermatologist and he said that the irritation was caused by the chemicals in this body wash and it could take a long time for the irritation to recede because of how long i was using the product. I would never recommend the men's product line to anyone (but "regular" dove products have always been a favourite of mine). Stick with the brands that have been around for a long time - Axe, old spice, etc

review/summary: Micromoisture? Really?
review/text: What can you say about a body wash? Does it get you clean? Yes. Well isn't that enough?<br /><br />Apparently not because this one has MICROMOISTURE technology. All these jargon words really make me laugh. You know there is a room of marketing guru's just sitting around thinking, "what words can we put together that will make our product sound revolutionary?"<br /><br />This team came up with: patent filed technology (yes that's right, "filed"), micromoisture technology, clinically proven, dermatologist recommended, and total skin comfort. I'm sure one of these is a typo on the container.<br /><br />But let's talk about the product now.<br /><br />Smell - it smells clean, masculine, not overpowering. It reminds me a bit of an Axe body spray.<br /><br />Texture - it has "purifying grains", which means it's sort of like using lava soap but in liquid form. It's gritty but not in a tear-up-your-skin way. That grit is supposed to help wash away dead skin cells and leave your skin refreshed and clean. I would have to say that yes, it does make my skin feel nice afterward.<br /><br />Where to use it - it says "body and face" but I don't really like micro-beads getting into my eyes. Be cautious about that. Great for body, not for the eyes - so when you're scrubbing your face be sure to squint really tight until you wash all the grit off.<br /><br />So what do I like? It smells good and it leaves my skin feeling like it's been cleaned very well.<br /><br />So what don't I like? It's not a shampoo & body wash, just a body wash, so I wind up having to use shampoo as well. This won't apply for bald men, but for the rest of us - I don't recommend using this as a shampoo because it takes forever to wash the microbeads out of your hair.<br /><br />As advertised the product gets 4 stars. Improvement idea would be to make an all-in-one product so I don't have to spend longer in the shower or use two products to get clean.

review/summary: Nice lather, don't care for the scent.
review/text: I choose this item and gave it to my husband to try (and yes, I even tried it once to see what it was like even though it is most definitely a mans smell). He likes the way it lathers up and rinses off easily even in our hard water, but neither of us care for the scent. I'm not sure what the smell is....maybe a sandalwood or something of the like, but neither of us cared for it. The scent didn't last long on the skin after showering, so that was a good thing for us. Scent is a very personal thing and some may really like the scent of this wash, we just didn't. I would like to see this product is some other scents or even in a non-scented variety. Overall, great product and would pick it up again if I could get a different scent.

review/summary: My new gym wash!!!
review/text: I don't know if it's just marketing, or something different about this body wash, but it's the only one I see labeled body wash AND face wash.  That makes it very convenient for going to the gym, since I can carry one less bottle.  (Nivea has shaving cream, body wash, shampoo, but I love my shampoo... and again, the label there doesn't actually say it's a face wash.)<br /><br />It rinses very cleanly, which is nice.  I'm not sure if it's terribly moisturizing, which is funny for Dove, since that's what they're known for.  The claim that it is...  but after using Dove Nutrium, my skin feels a definite difference.  After using using this, it didn't feel dry, but definitely didn't feel nearly as moisturized.<br /><br />The most surprising aspect about this wash was the fact that there is virtually no scent.  I expect Men's stuff to smell spicy, and other lines of this body wash definitely do, but not this mild formula.  I was initially somewhat disappointed, since I usually like smelling "manly", but it turns out it's actually makes it very good for going to the gym at noon, because when I get back to my office, I'm not knocking anyone out with my formidable scent.

review/summary: A satisfying body wash & facial cleanser!
review/text: Over the years I've become a bit of a soap snob. I typically use separate products - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB5IO6">Nivea</a> for my face and a generic soap for my skin. This body wash advertised "total skin comfort" so I figured I'd put it to the test.<br /><br />I uploaded a picture of a dollop of this wash - it has a somewhat cloudy look to it, and initially I was worried it wouldn't smell good or get me clean.<br /><br />I was wrong on both counts.<br /><br />After using this wash, I noticed a very faint smell, similar to talcum powder. Not overpowering, just enough to make me feel refreshed.<br /><br />My face felt clean and it didn't feel dried out, nor did the...rest of me.<br /><br />The price is a little high for this, but you can increase the # of uses per bottle by using a bath sponge or a regular washcloth. Gents, If you're looking to spoil your skin, this is a good choice (if you haven't already devoted yourself to Nivea).

review/summary: Nicely scented with a good texture, but a bit expensive
review/text: I was quite happy with how this product worked as a body wash, but I won't be buying it until the price comes down.  Given that every body wash that I've used has gotten me clean, my criteria for choosing one over another are pretty simple:  I want something with a pleasant scent, I want a product that isn't overly thin and watery, and I want to feel like I'm getting a good value.  This Dove body wash met the first two of those, so I give it a thumbs up in regards to performance.  The one balking point for me is that it costs about three times as much as the Suave men's body wash that I typically use, and I don't like it all that much more than the Suave.<br /><br />Overall, I gave it four stars.  Performance is a solid five stars, but value is closer to three stars, IMO.

review/summary: Definitely not my choice of body wash...
review/text: I have sensitive skin and have a tendency to breakout easily when using most body washes. Personally I've always loved Dove's products, especially the ones for sensitive skin... and I'm going to keep using those and toss this.<br /><br />Dove's Men + Care does an awesome job lathering up and cleaning. The smell isn't the least bit offensive and it washes off cleanly. It doesn't leave your skin feeling itchy or dry, which is very nice, and does leave your skin feeling soft<br /><br />However after using it I started to breakout. I looked at the ingredients and saw a whole heck of a lot of things I've never seen in my previous body washes and soaps. Out of all of the stuff in it, I'm not sure what particular ingredient it is, but there is something in it that I am sensitive to and had to quit using it.<br /><br />So other then being allergic to the body wash, it does a great job cleaning and the smell is quite pleasant. If it didn't break me out, I'd continue using it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cleans well.<br />Lathers up great.<br />Smells good.<br />Well priced.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Broke me out after a few uses.<br />Has about three times the ingredients as my normal body wash that doesn't break me out

review/summary: It's OK but check the ingredients label
review/text: I thought this was pretty decent. I found the scent pleasing without being over-powering and the scent did not linger in an obnoxious way. The body wash lathered nicely and when rinsed off, did not leave my skin as dry, flaky and scratchy as some other products I've used in the past.<br /><br />What is disappointing is that this product contains Petrolatum which is a by-product of petroleum (also known as petroleum jelly.) Petrolatum has been linked to causing or inflaming acne, it can actually clog your pores and of most concern is that it has been recognized as being a possible cancer risk. A bit of Googling will reveal all of this and more.<br /><br />Bottom line for me is that there are plenty of other skin care products that do not contain Petrolatum. I would not buy this again.

review/summary: Decent Bodywash; Misleading Labeling
review/text: Just to start with, I'm typically not the type to use Dove bodywash, though my fiancee is a huge fan of the female version.<br /><br />However, due to a pregnancy and the associated hypersensitivity to smells that come along with it, I had to give up my Old Spice Denali bodywash and went in search of an unscented one. My fiancee sent me to the store with "advice" to pick up a bottle of Dove unscented bodywash.<br /><br />Turns out Dove unscented, isn't; at least, not exactly.<br /><br />We found that out the next morning as I was getting ready. Despite the "unscented" label, while using the bodywash in the shower, the stuff has a very heavy fragrance, not really any different in strength than my usual Denali. So...Wasn't too surprised to get out of the shower only to find my fiancee on the other side of the apartment and every single balcony door open.<br /><br />That being said, the scent did seem to dissipate quickly and left only a faint odor after 15 minutes and no detectable scent within 30, but still.<br /><br />After a call to Unilever, customer service told me what April discovered. Namely, that the unscented bodywash did contain a fragrance (malfa or malta or something like that), but it was intended only to mask/neutralize the natural odors of the ingredients and definitely shouldn't have come across as a "heavy" odor in use, so...<br /><br />I don't know if we just wound up with a bad bottle or if that's just how the stuff works/smells, but. It obviously wouldn't work for our needs, so I'm back to basics with a plain, unscented bar of soap.

review/summary: Only product that has given me clear skin
review/text: I am not quite sure why so many reviews say this product causes them to break out.  It does the total opposite for me.  I have been searching for years for a product that can take care of face and body breakouts and finally found this.  It's not even advertised as an acne treatment, but it is the only thing that has ever worked. I have naturally oily skin, I suppose, so the drying effect described by many is beneficial for me, as it returns the skin to normal.  It leaves your face feeling tight, but not dry.<br /><br />I will definitely attest to the fact that this is a different product than the same label in the store.  The review that mentioned this was much more watery and less scented hit the nail on the head.  However, It still does the job. It's just curious that it's different.<br /><br />I could by 3 smaller bottles at my local grocery store for close to $20 or get three huge ones here for 15.<br /><br />All in all, if you have oily skin all over, this works.  If you don't, I figure it may dry it out...

review/summary: I like it quite a bit.
review/text: I'm quite choosy about my hygienic products -- toothpastes, soaps, washes and so on. In an effort to find a bath wash that wasn't too obnoxious or coarse in it's ingredients, I've been through a couple brands. Knowing this, this one came as a gift from my girlfriend at the time. So far, this is one of my favorites. I don't really have sensitive skin per se but the mildness of both it's fragrance and it's texture, or lack thereof, work good for my skin. The only minus, though I personally don't mind, is that it is advertised as "unscented" yet a scent is clearly apparent.<br /><br />It has no impact on the actual relevance of the product as a cleansing agent but I really like the look of the graphic design and industrial design of the product itself. The color scheme is nice and the bottle is easy to handle without slipping out of my hands. When the bath soap is getting low it also seems to do well at getting the last bits out unlike a lot of other brands I've tried where you have to pound the thing to get the last quarter of liquid out. The upside down orientation of the nozzle helps with this tremendously as does the shape of the bottle, I assume. Pretty good!

I thought I would give this a try since Dove is known for being a very good body wash. The scent is amazing, I absolutely love it but as for the moisturizer I'm not impressed at all. My back and top of my arms get very very dry as soon as I get out the shower and my skin is very tight as if I just washed with straight alcohol. This is why I had to give it only 2 stars.<br /><br />I'll have to use a different wash.

review/summary: A damn good body wash
review/text: I was using the blue Dove body wash for men... can't remember the name of it. This stuff is pretty good too. It isn't as in-your-face smelling as those other guys like Axe and Old Spice. This is a body wash for grown men who don't want to smell like they came out of a club. Good stuff and very moisturizing. My skin is so soft now

review/summary: Laundry Detergent
review/text: Like for many reviewers, initially this product was fantastic. Besides the smell that made me sneeze slightly, my skin became soft within a few days. I was recommending this product to everyone at that point. A few months later, I started having breakouts: I had not had any pimples in over 20 years. My skin started to itch more and more. I thought initially I was attacked by some type of microscopic bugs all over my body. It became unbearable. I finally made the connection with the soap. Smelling it was making me sneeze more and more. My skin was burning after each shower. It was as if I was washing my face and body with laundry detergent.<br />Allergies develop over time. It is often hard to make a connection with the allergens. As soon as I switched to another brand, the symptoms disappeared. I was taught in medical school that Dove is amongst the safest hypoallergenic products. This new line of products for men is to the contrary incompatible with my skin. I don't have any other allergies.I don't know if the regular white bar is still as safe as it used to be, Unilever lost my trust for ever. Just look at the ingredient list if you are still sceptical.

review/summary: As men's bodywashes go, this is pretty good
review/text: Let me start by saying I don't fall much for marketing hype and to me soap is soap. That being said, the Dove Men+Care line is pretty good. It gets me clean, doesn't have an overpowering smell (just a clean one) and works pretty well. I also use the deodorant and that is a good compliment to this as well. I'm not one for a lot of frills - I had been using Old Spice or Suave, but tried the Dove during the winter because my skin was dry. It works. As a bonus, it can usually be found on sale somewhere at a big box store. The only thing I will say is it doesn't lather quite as much as some other soaps - to me that's a positive, but it might not be to others.

review/summary: Best body wash ever!
review/text: I read some other reviews and saw that Dove's Body Wash for men dried up skin, clogged up pores, etc...  But remember, everyone's body chemistry is different.<br /><br />For me, this is the best body wash ever as it fits my chemistry perfectly.  I've used so many different face washes in the past, from Jack's to, Niveas, to Adidas, Old Spice and all of them caused me to break out on my face.<br /><br />Only this product does not cause me to get more pimples.  Yes it does dry my face out a little (but every face wash does that).  To remedy that, I put lotion on my face after I shower.  HOwever, after about 2-3 weeks of putting lotion on, I started to break out again so I took a 1 week break from putting on lotion and my skin was clear again.<br /><br />Anyways...<br /><br />Basically, if your body chemistry is anything like mine, this will make your pimples disappear.<br /><br />It also smells really good - not too overpowering so that it'll mess with any cologne I put on.  As for how it works as a body wash, well I'm not too picky and I don't see any difference from this product than Old Spice or any other men's wash.  But for washing my face, this thing is absolute magic.

review/summary: Stick with regular unisex Dove body wash
review/text: Ever since I was a young lad, I can remember using Dove products in the shower. Dove bar soap has always been a mainstay in my routine. Then a few years ago I tried Dove's body wash. Great products all -- moisturizing, rich and without overpowering scent. I'd always hoped that Dove would introduce its products for men, perhaps with more masculine scents and packaging. Finally, Dove introduced its Men+Care line.<br /><br />I've tried out just about every body wash in the line and unfortunately, these are nothing like the "unisex" Dove body washes. The men's line is like any other typical gel you'd find among the Old Spices and Irish Springs of the pharmacy aisle. This product does little to moisturize, it's hard to squeeze out of the bottle (there's a very small opening and the plastic walls of the bottle are thick and rigid) and it doesn't wash off cleanly.<br /><br />Dove's standard body washes are thicker and richer. They are also far more moisturizing thanks to Dove's Nutrium Moisture system. The men's line does not have Nutrium Moisture. So unless you've just absolutely got to use products that say "for men" on the bottle, I'd stick with Dove's unisex line.

review/summary: It's Ok
review/text: I gave these to my brother to try.  He was not thrilled with the scent but he said it wasn't bad.  He also said it didn't lather up much.  He did say that his skin hasn't been as dry as it normally is so I guess that is a plus.  Overall he said he would use it but not necessarily buy it again.  I just think it is a guy thing.  He will probably just go back to using the bar soap that dries him out.  Go figure.  : )

review/summary: Great Body Wash
review/text: Yes, I have been using this for almost 2 years now. The 3 pack lasts almost 4 months and your feel clean and restful after every shower.<br />It doesn't have to much cologne/perfume. It lathers very well, giving a clean and prudent bath each time.

review/summary: Great Body Wash!
review/text: First let me start off by saying I used to use a competitors body was that was not designed for men (or women for that matter). It really did little to moisturize my skin.<br /><br />When I got this product and used it for the first time my skin felt great.  It took a little getting used to the gritty feel but after that it didn't bother me. I got one of the Shower tools they sell a few days later and it helped me use a little less and get the same results.

review/summary: Nice scent but gritty texture
review/text: This Dove product has a nice clean smell, not too sweet or fruity (like many of the other men's body washes). However, the lotion in my bottle had a very gritty texture, which was off-putting.

review/summary: It's for men
review/text: It's a bit strong immediately from the bottle but after it's been rinsed off, it is not too imposing.  Like other Dove products it is gentle on sensitive and dry skin and is a good option for those of us who have chronic dry skin.

review/summary: It gets you clean
review/text: To some extent, soap is soap, whatever the form.  What makes this Dove Body Wash better or worse than similar products?<br /><br />It gets you clean:  that's good.  On the other hand, there's nothing exceptional about the job it does.  In addition, if you are particularly sensitive to smell, the fragrance may be a bit much.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is the package.  Personally, I prefer to have the bottle dispense from the top, and while most containers can work with either side up, this one requires a bit of a balancing act if you want the dispenser at the top.  What annoys me more, however, is the opaqueness of the container, which makes it harder to determine how much body wash you have left.<br /><br />Overall, this is an okay product, but not one I'd go out of my way to get.

review/text: The company blurb says it all and like all cosmetics there is a matter of taste/opinion involved. Basically it performs its job very well and has a very refreshing fragrance, not too sweet or cloying. I don't see why women couldn't use this product as well!

review/summary: A guy's review
review/text: I asked my husband to give me his opionion of this product as I thought it would be more useful than mine.<br /><br />He likes the smell (I do too by the way - I don't feel it's overpowering which some scented soaps are).  He does NOT like the gritty texture of the soap and doesn't feel that adds to the cleaning capabilities.  The soap does not cause him to break out or give him rashes.  I have been experimenting with liquid soaps recently to reduce soap scum in his tub - this was not a winner on that front - I noticed even more soap scum than before.

review/summary: Dove for Men? Genius!
review/text: I've been a loyal Dove product user for years so when Dove decided to come out with a men's line of products, I was very excited to have my boyfriend try them out. Of course, he was hesitant about using something that was always intended for women. After a little prodding, he reluctantly tried it out. Not only did he like itbut it made his skin feel incredible and he smelled great. He's already asked me to get him another bottle soon. I think he might take my recommendations in the future. :)
