review/text: miracle noodles are a great option for people who are on a low carb diet but enjoy/crave noodles from time to time. Yes, they smell coming out of the package.  Rinse thoroughly.  They do not smell or taste funny once prepared. The texture is more like a rice noodle/cellophane noodle as opposed to wheat pasta. I prefer the angel hair pasta more than the rice, which reminds me of Israeli couscous or orzo.

review/summary: A Great Substitute!
review/text: I discovered this item from a segment on the local news.  I decided to give it a try.  Firstly, they didn't prepare me for the fishy smell once you open the package.  I had to rinse it several times to get rid of the smell.  Also, be aware that the texture is definitely different than egg noodles and they have no taste.<br /><br />I boiled them in hot water, added some beef base, and the noodles were fine.  The noodles absorbed the taste of the beef base, but use whatever you want with them.

review/summary: Different Texture but No Fishey Smell
review/text: I had read earlier reviews about the noodles smelling like fish. This made me wary to buy them, but I decided to be adventurous and got them anyway. When I first cooked them, there was no fishy smell that I could detect. The only problem I found was the texture. It was like jello and rubber combined. Once I got used to the texture, they were ok, but did not absorb much of the sause they were cooked in. I do not plan on buying these again, but may consider trying one of their flavored noodles.

review/summary: No miracle, they are NOT edible!
review/text: I tried these noodles while doing the HCG diet.  I found that I could not chew them and the only way I could eat them was to swallow them whole.  This defeated the purpose of enjoying a noodle without the guilt.  The saying "If its too good to be true, it probably is" applies here.  Stick to the diet without these noodles.  You are just throwing your money down the drain by purchasing them.

review/summary: Great Alternative to Pasta!
review/text: I tried these noodles even after reading the negative reviews about the fishy smell and I am SO glad I did.  What you need to do is rinse them thoroughly and boil them before you add them to your food.  As long as you do this it will NOT have that fishy smell.  I made some awesome stir frys with lots of veggies and either shrimp or chicken.  I even tricked my hubby and he is NOT into healthy food at all. They are even surprisingly filling.  I love my carbs, but too many make me gain weight so I am very pleased to have found this alternative. I am even going to do the auto ship to save some money.  Enjoy!

review/text: I put milk in a pan and added olive oil, fresh garlic, and a little  cheese. Then I mix in the noodles in. I  really liked them. They aren't really like rice or pasta, more like a chinese noodle. They do smell bad at first but I guess its an acquired taste. There is nothing rubbery about the texture if you cook them just right.  I ususally use the stove timer.  I decided to try these to cut back on calories.

review/summary: Wow - I am surprised by these.
review/text: I have to admit that I was not to sure about this product but decided to give it a try.  Zero carbs, fat, calories..... Is this truly a miracle food? The pasta arrived super fast but I was nervous to try them. Today was the day. I got the stainer ready and quickly opened one package and dumped the angel hair pasta in and started to rinse. I read about the fish smell and didn't want that to spoil my experience. I have to say that the smell was not real noticeable especially with the quick dump and rinse method. And not there at all after some cold water rinsing.<br /><br />My recipe was quick and easy. Take a handful of shrimp (i used frozen cooked shrimp that I had already) saut&eacute; in a little EVOO with garlic and onion powder. Add a few tablespoons of salsa and a few green olives. Add the angle hair pasta and heat through. I took half of a low carb Italian herd tortilla and cut it into wedges and toasted in the toaster oven till crisp. (This gave me the crunch that is usually missing from a low carb diet but only 3 net carbs.)  The pasta really did take on the flavor of the sauce and lost some of the rubbery texture.<br /><br />The Miracle Noodles are not a flour noodle so you can not expect them to taste the exact same but they are a great no carb option. I am very pleased with my purchase and I would buy them again.

review/summary: Ok...to be honest...
review/text: Not as bad as I was anticipating. For what these noodles are (virtually no calories - gluten free - free food), they are wonderful. They are slimy, but if you chew them very well you'll be fine. The fishy smell is overwhelming and if you have a bad gag reflex do not breathe in the entire time you are cooking these. I washed them for a few minutes, boiled them, sauteed them with Walden Farms Calorie Free Pasta Sauce for a few minutes. I added about 3 cloves of chopped garlic and Italian seasoning. The fishy smell did go away. They are very filling, but the bag itself for the price is very expensive - this is about one serving. Not sure if I will purchase again - maybe eat a salad with Walden Farms Calorie Free dressing instead for a zero calorie meal, as this was very difficult to finish.

review/summary: Dear lord, thank you for sending me miracle noodles...
review/text: i received my shipment of a 6 pack of miracle noodles yesterday and couldnt wait to try them. i tried the tofu ones, similar to these noodles (by a different company i believe) and i gagged on the noodles. the texture was inedible in my opinion. needless to say i was a bit weary about the taste/texture of these noodles...but 0 calories? like i said, i couldnt wait to try them. i rinsed them for approximately 3 minutes in hot water. yes, there is a fish smell when you open them, but it goes away with rinsing. i broiled some water and let them cook for about 5 minutes. i drained them and gave them a light pat down with a paper towel. i made a sauce out of lime juice, cilantro, garlic, shallots, srirracha, and olive oil. tossed it with the pasta and sat down. i left it alone for 5 minutes to let the pasta soak in the sauce.<br /><br />first bite:<br /><br />it absolutely tastes like whatever you put it on. the noodles have no taste at all. (if you noodles taste like the fishy smell when they are first opened, you havent rinsed/cooked them long enough) texture wise, they are very akin to asian vermicelli noodles, which i personally love. i have seen reports of the noodles having the texture of "gummy worms" and "rubber bands" which i dont think are accurate at all. but i guess everyones palate is different.<br /><br />all in all, these will be my new pasta substitute. i probably wouldnt use them in a sauce like marinara or alfredo, but who knows...

review/text: Please DO NOT waste your money. It looks like a bag of noodles, dried, but is actually a very small amount of gross, gelatinous noodles in a bag full of water. to cook it, you drain the pasta, rinse with cold water and put in a boiling bowl of hot water for one minute. I thought after they were "cooked" they'd be less disgusting, but, alas they were even more gooey and gross. Eat a big salad or some oatmeal to feel full. This was so freaking gross and now I have six bags of the yucky stuff in my cabinet. Too expensive for something that doesn't work and is gross as well. It did make me feel full, but only for about 30 minutes and then I had digestive issues for a week.

review/summary: Calorie Free Noodles!!!! Amazing
review/text: Miracle Noodles are calorie free noodles that are based on a very traditional Japanese food.  What this company has done is to make them more appealing to people in the west with various different shapes.  I saw them on the Talk with Rocco Dispirito as one of the recipes in his new book Eat This Now! Diet features Miracle Noodles.<br /><br />They take on the flavor of anything you cook them with BUT you must follow the instructions which are to rinse and boil for one minute then dry (this last step being very important)  They are mostly water so for me they work best in soups and casseroles.  Check out their facebook page for tons of recipes from customers.<br /><br />My father eats these since he is diabetic and my mother has lost lots of weight just eating these for lunch everyday.  As with anything, there is a learning curve with working with them, don't expect an Italian pasta right out of the bag, but with experimentation and the cookbook the company allows you to download on their website, as well as all the recipes from customers on the facebook page, you will find that you have just discovered a way to eat in an incredibly low calorie way that tastes great.  Isn't that all you could ask for?

Once i recieved them i opened the package and the smell is pretty strong fishy smell but not that bad. I cooked them exactly how it said to and they came out perfect. No smell or funny textures. I was worried i wouldnt be able to make them right but its pretty simple. We were doing the HCG diet and it got very boreing eating the same thing everyday and this added so many more options that we could do with the allotted food!

review/text: So if you read the reviews, you'll see that some people thing these things are great. Many otehres cant get over the texture, and the initial smell is ... bad. I was able to wash out the smell pretty well, leaving a very mild fishy mildewy aftertaste. The texture... awful. Nasty. Chewy fishy pasta. The only good thing I can say about this stuff is the individual bags it comes in are really small -- about single serving size. So I've got a bunch I can inflict on my friends if I can trick them into trying it.

review/summary: Terrible Texture
review/text: I tried really hard to like these. I'm used to making substitutions in my low-carb lifestyle, and I went into this with an open mind.  I knew they wouldn't be starchy like real pasta noodles.  I prepared myself for the smell, thinking that carb-free pasta is worth any smell that washes off; oddly enough, the packages I got had little or no odor at all.  I followed the directions exactly the first time, then followed a few suggestions from people I know who loves these things in an attempt to make them work for me.  In the end, I just couldn't get past the texture.  I tried making them less firm, more firm, keeping them really hot...nothing worked to get me past that gelatinous, slipperly, worm-iness.  The first bite wasn't too bad, but after a couple more, I completely lost my appetite.  Flavor-wise, these really will just take on the taste of whatever you put on, or in them.  But texture and appearance are big factors for me in food, and these clear, sinewy-textured attempts at noodliness were just not appetizing for me.

review/summary: A Diet Life Saver!
review/text: I am not sure how long Miracle Noodles have been around, I discovered them sort of by accident.<br /><br />I am about 8 to 10 years late to the low carb lifestyle but I figured any diet that allows me to eat meats and cheeses can't be too terrible.<br /><br />All was fine until I started missing my old carb friend...pasta.  IT was a crippling blow to my diet as I literally went into anxiety mode everytime I saw pasta in a tv show, commercial, movie, read about it...hell, I almost had a breakdown while watching "Lady and the Tramp".<br /><br />Almost as a joke I Googled "zero carb pasta" just to laugh at myself but something unexpected happened. No, Google did not grow a hand and smack me for being stupid, it actually returned the Miracle Noodle page in the results.<br /><br />I was skeptical...who wouldn't be? It is simply not possible to get a real pasta experience from a plant.  Or so I thought!  On a whim and without doing a terrible amount of research I ordered a ten pack of angel hair noodles. 70 glorious ounces of zero carb/zero calorie noodly goodness.<br /><br />For the record, the following is true:<br /><br />They stink.  Yes, there is an odor when you open the package due to fermenting, but once the noodles are washed and boiled the smell is gone and there is no foul taste associated with the smell.<br /><br />They are flavorless.  Yes, they don't have a starchy flavor so common in pasta and noodles because they are not made from starch. They are simply plant fiber.<br /><br />They have a rubbery texture.  Sort of, but if you follow the instructions this is minimized and the end result is on par with a toothsome al dente pasta. It is not like chewing on rubber bands.<br /><br />The noodles do take on the flavor of whatever you cook them in, sort of similar to the way tofu operates. Because of this, I recommend not using the noodles as you would spaghetti. If you boil your noodles and cover them in pasta sauce you are setting yourself up for disappointment, and the makers of the product know this, hence they give you a recipie booklet to take full advantage of the power of the noodle.<br /><br />I usually make a spicy stir fry in szechuan sauce and add the noodles at the last moments and allow the noodles to absorb the peppery sauce.  The entirte dish has only 4 grams of carbs and is filling.<br /><br />Let's not forget that the noodles are a great source of fiber!<br /><br />Do not go into the order process expecting spaghetti or egg noodles. But if you are on low carb, gluten free, or simply trying to change your eating habits then Miracles Noodles are simply that, a miracle.<br /><br />Thank you Miracle Noodles for allowing me to enjoy my food once again.

review/text: Okay.....I tried these noodles initially because of the HCG Diet. I continue to use them now because they are delicious! Not to mention how good they are for you.<br />If you have never had them before....be ready for the smell of fish when you first open the bag. (they are stored in water) The key to getting the smell out is rinsing thoroughly in cold water before cooking them.<br />They are easily prepared....<br />I found that pouring boiling hot water over the noodles to warm them works great, opposed to boiling them in the water. Patting the noodles dry (I use paper towels) before adding your favorite topping is a must!! This keeps them from becoming slimy. If you have left overs, they reheat wonderfully!! In fact I find everything taste better the next day.<br />The texture is definitely different from egg noodles. They are kind of like gummy worms without any flavor. The noodles absorb the flavor of whatever you top them with. Spaghetti & stir fry are a couple of my favorites!!<br />One last note.....<br />The unopened packages store without refrigeration and have a 6 month shelf life.<br />I hope this helps!!

review/summary: PREPARE THEM IN A YUMMY WAY
review/text: I am following the South Beach diet and saw these on Dr Oz. Who wouldn't want to have "pasta" while not actually having pasta? But, all the negative reviews freaked me out, so I was nervous to try them :)  However, I did follow many reviewers' advice and they were delicious.  No calories, no carbs...I'm in!!<br /><br />Here's what I did. Opened the bag, dumped them in a mesh colander and rinsed, rinsed, rinsed them. Blotted dry on a paper towel. Heated up some olive oil and a little garlic and threw the noodles in. Added what I had on hand: some cooked chicken, cooked diced zuchinni, a little spaghetti sauce and ricotta cheese. Let simmer for maybe 5-8 min. Sprinkled with some parmesan cheese. Really DELICIOUS! My husband even ate some and didn't say a word. I thought they were really good. Mixed in with a bunch of other ingredients and sauce these tasted like angel hair pasta to me. Worth it! Note the 7 oz package is very small. Really one large meal or 2 smaller meals. Probably only about 1-1/2 cups of noodles.<br /><br />If you are following a low-carb diet these are a treat. More realistic pasta taste than a spaghetti squash, for example. Definitely worth a try.

Don't get fooled by all these negative reviews!<br /><br />If you like Asian food, you probably already know that their pasta doesn't taste like American/European kind. it has a different texture and taste. So these noodles taste exactly like the ones you order at Big Bowl :)<br /><br />The comments about the smell are ridiculous! How many raw uncooked food smells good? Are you kidding me? For instance, I love steamed broccoli but it smells bad while steaming! :)<br /><br />PLEASE follow the instructions: rinse in cold water for at least 15 seconds and boil for one minute, dry in paper towels. if you don't follow instructions, you will ruin ANY food, even your most favorite!<br /><br />Since the pasta is 0 calories, I finally could indulge myself with a really good pasta sauce ( no low fat anymore ) or some seafood Alfredo! the possibilities are endless. Please note that the noodles even better the next day since they easily absorb all flavors.<br /><br />Absolutely delicious and guilt free!

review/text: ok so you guys, after reading all the reviews, I took a risk and ordered these. The smell when opening was pretty bad, but that is just the preservatives. Wash the noodles under cold water for 4-5 mintues. This takes away the taste and smell. I cooked these for the first time in hot water for about 1-2 minutes and put it sauce. The first bite was OK but after a few more bites, it was disgusting, not because of the taste because you cannot taste the noodles, it was because of the texture. It really was like rubber bands like all the other reviewers said.<br /><br />So i kept experimenting, and realized that after rinsing 4-5 minutes, you have to boil it in hot water for 5-7 minutes, then rinse them in cold water again for a minute. Mix it in your sauce and it is alot softer and that rubber band texture is completely gone. It was like vermicelli noodles. Im going to try the fettuccine noodles next but my last experience was so much better.

review/summary: No Guilt Noodle? This Definitely Is A Miracle!
review/text: I did not believe that there could be a zero calorie, soy free , gluten free noodle that actually tastes good. But I believe now thanks to Miracle Noodle. For those of you that have already made the switch from regular pasta to wheat pasta; your next switch will be to Miracle Noodles. I was amazed to find that unlike some pastas/noodles this product absorbs flavor and cooks quickly. I have prepared these in stir fries with such things as olive oil, pasta sauces, and chicken broth. All of my meals have come out great and the best part is that they leave you feeling full. The second best part is that you do not feel guilty later for having eaten a noodle. I have tried all of the Miracle Noodle products and am still deciding which one is my favorite. Obviously I am a big fan and think others will quickly become one too.

review/summary: Shirataki (Miracle Noodles)
review/text: I usually don't do reviews but this item is a real treat.<br />You can usually find shirataki noodles at any korean/chinese supermart.<br />And when you open it, it does have fishy smell, just rinse a few times it goes right away.<br />Next, what i do; I boil my noodles in sauce of my like, the great thing about them is they take on<br />any flavor your put them in.  I boil them and let them sit for about 30min or more, because I like them<br />to absorb all the flavor and soften.  Which they do very well when boiling over 30min.<br />They are great for HCG dieters which I currently am on.<br />A lil trick I just learned was after I boil about 2 to 3 bags I put them away and eat as needed.<br />So I would take a piece of my allowed HCG diet food IE 3.5 oz meat or veggie or both.<br />Take Pam and cut up a few pieces of onion and pan fry the noodles, onion and meat or veggies.  YUMM!!<br />A complete meal cal count of 8cal to 95cal and you feel full.  Can't beat that.  Good Luck! :)

review/summary: They are worth the work!
review/text: How do you make these delicious?<br /><br />Hold your nose, snip the bag open and pour into a colindar with your faucet on hot full blast; if you have a spray option use it to cover the noodles better.  I let this rinse and drain in the hot water for a full minute, agitating the noodles the whole time to REALLY rinse them well.  I then put them in a salad spinner and spin them dry.  I place them in a bowl and nuke for 90 seconds, then I give them another spin to get them dry again.  While still hot, I place them in a big bowl and cover with a zesty pasta sauce, stir and let them sit for several minutes while I boil pasta for my hubby and daughter.  When their's is ready, I sprinkle mine with cheese, add a few meatballs and nuke again until very hot.  We all get a spagetti dinner on the table at the same time and I get to keep my plate well under 10 carbs.<br /><br />Prepared this way, I think they taste very good.  I also do a spicy Thai peanut sauce that I also have the noodles sit in before heating and enjoying with grated carrots, sliced green onions and shredded cabbage.  I think it is important to really let the noodles rest in the sauce of your choice so they have a chance to absorb flavor.  If you do not do this, they taste awful!  I just rinsed and heated them the first time I had them and hated them.  I went through the above process to rid them of the packing water, which is the element I couldn't like.  I am not bothered by the texture because I dress them with a lot of textures so I never notice them tasting different.  I would not cook these and dress with only butter and cheese, you need to bury them a bit in a hearty dish.  I have snipped these smaller and made a great tuna casserole that my family liked too.<br /><br />I have not tried the fetaccini cut, but the smaller angel hair melds easily into dishes, a thicker noodle may be more rubbery.<br /><br />If you spend the prep time they are great!

review/summary: DE-licious!
review/text: I was very apprehensive about the noodles, but they are really great!<br />I got the angel hair style, and they are just like Asian cellophane noodles.<br />I personally wouldn't use the angel hair style with a marinara sauce, as I can't imagine they would hold up to that heavy sauce.  I made them with fresh tomatoes, basil & mozzarella with a tiny bit of olive oil and it was delicious!<br />Again, much like a cellophane noodle, they soak up whatever sauce you cook them with.<br /><br />They come packaged in water, and they say to rinse them then drop them in boiling water.  When you first put them in the colander, they do have a slight odor, but this dissipates as soon as you rinse them, and have no flavor.<br /><br />Totally worth it!  Saves you so many calories.

review/summary: HCG diet life saver
review/text: Ok, there are plenty of reviews and I might be giving the same review as someone else but whatever.  I am on the HCG diet which is why I give these things a four star rating, (otherwise, um...yuk? Tofu and squash noodles are waaaaay better)  However, tofu and squash are NOT allowed on the HCG diet ! People, this stuff has no calories, no sugar, no fat...just fiber.  What do people expect?  Something delicious???  Anyways, this is what I do: quick drain and rinse then throw them into some already boiled water for a minute or two.  Meanwhile I have some sort of stir-fry going on in a separate pan (I eat this stuff for dinner) So after the noodles have boiled for about 2 minutes I toss them in there and mix it all up with......secret ingredient......BEEF BULLION!!!! These things soak the beef flavor up and without the bullion I wouldn't bother eating them on the HCG diet.  They are still a bit gummy but the added flavor helps A LOT. For no added calories or fat, this stuff is great.

I just wish all these pasta and rice noodle people would simply leave out the SUGARS and lower their salt... let me add a teas of sugar to their boiling water or a bucket of salt to flavor - dont make the rest of the world suffer.

review/text: Just got these noodles through groupon.  Fantastic.  They're a lot like clear rice noodles.  Easy to prepare after a thorough rinsing.  Absorb all the flavors of the sauce they're in. For the people who are bashing the noodles: 1. Try exercising instead of whining about a food that has 0 (zero), as in none, calories.  One star, really?  2. Don't diet if you want to eat foods that taste good with no effort. 3. Take this opportunity to learn to cook healthy.

review/summary: Positive Review
review/text: To be perfectly honest, I was scared to death to give these noodles a try.  With all the negative comments, I was sure I'd wasted my money.  First of all, everyone talked about the fishy stinky smell when opening the package.  I didn't smell a thing.  I neither avoided or stuck my nose in the package.  I simply opened the pack, dumped in a strainer and rinsed.  No big deal!<br /><br />I got my water boiling and put them in the water long enough to heat.  I drained and added a little olive oil to keep them from sticking together.  I put marinara sauce on them and added my meatballs.  I then topped it off with grated parmesan cheese.  I'm looking forward to stir fry next.  I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about; I'm one of the pickiest people I know when it comes to how my food taste!<br /><br />These noodles are thin, white/clear in color.  I tasted one plain; it doesn't have a negative taste but bland and will absorb the flavors of what you're cooking with.  I have no idea why people say they look like worms!  They are the typical Asian noodle you would find in Asian/Oriental cooking.<br /><br />If you have missed having high carb noodles you should give these a try.  If you are a die-hard wheat spagetti person, then maybe these won't satisfy your craving for spagetti and meatballs.  I'm going to rate them a 5 because I know they will be even better in the oriental dishes I've been missing.

review/summary: Mixed Family Reviews
review/text: My grandchildren and I tried the pasta as my youngest GS is on a carb restricted diet. I found the noodles to have an extremely unpleasant odor when I opened the package. I found it "fishy" and so strong as to give me difficulty cooking them. I am not able to tolerate fish odor well. However,my grandchildren did not remark on the odor at all. The taste was masked by the tomato meat sauce that I used and both of them ate it eagerly. They are much more expensive than regular pasta.  The entire package made small servings for the 3 of us, far less pasta than an equal weight of dried pasta would provide. We will use this up, but I doubt that I will buy again.

review/text: Maybe it's me but I just can't get over the very strong fishy smell. Don't get me wrong, I love seafood but this is something else. After rinsing for a while it does go away and it does not smell or taste fishy after you cook it. It actually has no taste at all. Between the rubbery texture and pre-cooking smell, i just could not enjoy it.

review/text: Great idea - no calories, no fat, etc. They are slimey and chewing them is what I'd guess chewing worms would be like. They are firm enough to have more texture than pasta, but still gel like. I just put them with spaghetti sauce, but maybe there's a better option. Have not found it yet. I've read more about them and what nutritional benefits they may have so it makes it worth the try. Cost is certainly reasonable enough. Give them a try and maybe you'll have a better idea.

review/summary: Surprisingly delightful
review/text: I was going to write a review whether I thought these were good or bad. Of course I was going to hope for good because I just ordered three packages without evening knowing what they really tasted like. I was risking a gamble. I just got the package today and decided I was going to try them today. I had been informed and read the reviews about how the noodles really take on the flavor and that is completely correct. I cooked them in boiling water with soy sauce and garlic salt. Those noodles tasted superbly. I was not disappointed. If anything I was surprised how well they took in the flavor. I was a bit skeptic but I am glad to have been proved wrong. Also, I did make sure to rinse the noodles thoroughly to get rid of the fish smell. I am not 100% there was a fish smell because I had some dishes from when I just had crab but even if there was a smell there was not taste of it in the food. The noodles do clump a bit even after I patted them down with the paper towel but they can be taken apart. Honestly, they remind me a bit of ramen noodles but these are better because there are no calories to them! While ramen noodles are not exactly at a good place on the food pyramid.<br /><br />The reason I decided to give these a try is because I am on the HCG diet and if you are on that diet you know you are limited to very particular foods because it is calorie based. This is a great addition to this diet. I get to eat more without the worry of hurting my diet. I also get very full. I only used half the packet for my meal and found it to be very filling. If you are looking for something to help with a diet or just want to try to be healthy without giving up all your loves such as pasta I recommend these. I can't wait to try the other foods that are offered by this company.

review/summary: Keep your expectations low
review/text: Perhaps if I'd read more reviews beyond the ones supplied by the manufactures/sellers, I'd have expected a bit less. Though not naive' enough to believe they would quite resemble traditional pasta,  the reviews led me to believe they would more palatable  They arrive  "precooked", packaged  in watery solution and all you have to do is snip the bag, rinse thoroughly and blanch in boiling water for one minute.  Here's where I went wrong: Knowing in advance they had a reputation for smelling foul, I should NEVER have personally verified this. Think decaying roadside animal carcass.  It's really that bad. Once I smelled them, they hardly had a chance. I rinsed them for 2 minutes or more and then blanched as directed, and doused them with a Thai peanut dressing. While they take on the flavor of their  accompanying sauce/seasoning, that's where the encouraging news ends. Zero Calorie Noodles  chew like rubber bands and leave you generally disappointed. If you like chewy Asian glass noodles, maybe, just maybe these will satisfy. The idea sounds good, but reality is a foul smelling, chewy crunch that is not worth the non-nutritive effort.

review/text: I'm on Keto, consuming less than 10 carbs per day (and feeling awesome!).  These are a terrific addition to my diet.  A terrific way to cut half the calories/fat in your meal is to supplement your meal with these noodles. I have tried all three varieties. The only difference is the form.  They are easy to "make".  Just add sauce or stir-fry.  The liquid smell is gross, but it washes off nicely. Are they the equivalent of pasta? No!  But pretty damn close considering that they have nothing in them.  I've also made pizza crust using these noodles. Mmmm goood.

review/summary: I was a skeptic, but I am glad I took the plunge!  They're great!
review/text: I am doing Atkins, and I really missed noodles.  For me it wasn't necessary to have PASTA per se, but anything close, and these ramen-like noodles seemed like a good thing to try.  Having also tried low-carb pasta, I can say these are a HUGE improvement.  So far, I have only used them in stir fry, in which they are perfectly tasteless until they absorb the flavors in which you cook them.  I was frightened at first that I would be able to taste the strongly fishy smell of the liquid in which they are packaged.  But by following the instructions--rinse them for like 15 seconds and plunk them in some boiling water for a minute--I was able to completely de-fishify them!<br /><br />My main concern now is the cost, since these cost about 10x what a similarly sized pack of ramen noodles costs.  I am hoping to be able to get them in larger quantities, hopefully more densely packed in the package since it seems like 3/4 of the package weight just goes down the drain.  If I can get these for less than a dollar per 7 oz serving by buying in enormous quantities, I'll eat them twice a day for the rest of my life.  Seems like they could sell these in larger packages or jars and get a higher noodle-to-water ratio?  I bet the biggest cost of this item is shipping since they're basically shipping a pound of water.

review/text: The shiritaki noodles are great. they are not too chewy, A good size for a two serving meal.<br />I hate the title but that's the company's business.  I like to use them for brothy soups with fish or chicken and vegetables, they are great for simmering to pick up flavor or for tossing into a veggie stirfry at the end for more volume.  With  a bit of fat like butter or meaty juices it's a great way to fill up and stay unhungry between meals or if  you are dieting.

review/summary: Overpriced
review/text: I feel like you don't get enough noodles for the money.  It is incredibly expensive, there aren't that many noodles, and I did NOT feel full from this.  The noodles do smell once you take them out of the package; however, they cook up rather easily.  They will stick together - so when you take them out of the water and put them on paper towels, make sure that you lay them out - otherwise, you will have issues later.  They do NOT have a taste, so make sure that you stir fry them or let them simmer with whatever you are using them with, otherwise, you will be disappointed.  Sorry, but I won't buy them again - too much money.

review/text: Bought these as a no carb alternative to noodles.  They are a great replacement when you are really craving noodles.  I have used for spaghetti and other red sauce dishes.<br /><br />They smell a bit weird, and take some getting used to.  They have the texture of noodles, but don't taste like anything.  Would not recommend eating them by themselves.  Great with your favorite spaghetti sauce.

review/text: Well, when you buy a noodle made with yam flour, tofu, or something unconventional you cannot expect it to feel or taste like regular noodles.<br /><br />That being said, I knew what I was buying and I got what I expected. A chewy/gummy noodle, that can be used as a pasta substitute.<br /><br />It's filling, the noodles smell unpleasant when you first open the bag...but that goes away once rinsed and heated.<br /><br />I actually like these noodles. Quite tasty and versatile if prepared correctly (i.e. in soups, stir fried with garlic and veggies, etc).

I am used to dry noodles; these are slippery and wet when you take them out of the package.  I'm not impressed.

review/text: I ordered these noodles, (6) Packages, because I wanted pasta and was doing the hcg diet.  There is a slight odor of fish when you open the package.  I dumped the water out and rinsed the noodles(no big deal really), boiled them and then and put them in the pasta sauce.  The noodles don't really have a taste themselves but there is a strange consistency when you chew them.  Sort of like jelly fish--chewy.  My husband could not get past the consistency of the noodles.  I didn't mind it as much.  Like I said there is no taste to them really and I will eat the rest of them myself.  The packages are small probably meant to be individual servings.

review/summary: Information for the first time buyer
review/text: I was not familiar with this product, but my wife was interested because of it's mention on popular daytime television.  Here are somethings you should know if you are unfamiliar with the product.<br /><br />1 star: The noodles come packaged in water, so one 7 oz package must be strained to obtain one 3 oz serving of noodles, very different from traditional dry pasta.<br />3 star: The package, noodles in water, is a bit awkward to store on your traditional pantry shelf, you can't really stack them, etc.<br />3 star: The noodles have an expiration date that is approximately four months away.  Don't order more than a few months supply.<br />3 star: Because the noodles are already hydrated, they do not really take on much flavor from cooking liquid, you better put them into a very flavorful dish.<br />2 star: Copared to pasta, these pre-hydrated noodles have a very slimy mouthfeel and they are not able to be cooked al dente, so they do not give the same fished result as a pasta substitute.<br />5 star: As advertised, they are low calorie, filling, and a great source of soluable fiber.

review/summary: "It feels like I am chewing gummy bungee cords..."
review/text: These noodles were just delivered and I was excited to make them for my weight and health conscious high school daughter and friend. I carefully read all of the reviews and took them into consideration when preparing these "noodles." Yes, they smell but nothing ~too~ bad; once they are rinsed the smell is pretty much nullified. After running them through really hot water for a few minutes I patted them dry and seasoned them with our favorite seasonings with oil, salt, garlic salt, lawry's, pepper and a little bit of Panda Express' orange chicken sauce and then baked/broiled them for probably 30 minutes (turning frequently). (FYI: After 30 minutes of broiling they would not get the tad crispiness that we enjoy with normal pasta.)<br />Anyway, from pan to serving dish I am at a loss for how to explain these noodles. They are nothing like spaghetti pasta AT ALL. They are translucent and...springy. While first chewing them we all slowed down to figure out what the heck we were eating and why because it didn't quite feel like food was in our mouths. Finally, my daughter's friend said, "It feels like I am chewing gummy bungee cords..." We all thought about it and totally agreed. My daughter kept saying, "I am thinking fish eyeballs..." After giving these what we thought was a fair shot, we politely put our forks down and pushed our plates away. I poured the batch down the sink feeling disappointed, but also knowing that I couldn't in good conscience feed these to my chickens either.

Something I should've done first I guess.  I had no idea they came in liquid--I assumed they came dry, as all pastas do. I also didn't know how small the packages are!  Now, I'm reading that they stink too?  Oh wow.  Do I even bother trying them? I bought them for 3 family members, one is on the HCG diet, and 2 are diabetics. To feed us I'll probably have to use my whole order--all 6 packages. Not sure if I'm happy with this...

review/text: I rate it 3 stars because of my personal taste.  I still think it's a good alternative for people who need it, but I won't reorder.  I've been using the shiritaki noodles that are Soy/tofu based and I like them a lot more.  These are a bit too strange for me. It's plant cellulose it seems.  The texture is of an acquired taste, a bit gelatinous, a bit like cartilage. They're transparent and could be used in an asian soup quite well.  I'm probably going to do this with the remaining bags I got.  It's a different way to eat soluble fibers, but it makes a strange noodle.  I really love the Tofu ones though, So if you can eat soy I'd got for those instead.

I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed some more, but the smell was terrible.  I would gag from just the smell of them.  Needless to say they all went in the trash.  Even my dog wouldn't eat them and he will even eat dead stuff off the road (road kill) so you see he is not picky. Don't do like me, just order one pack until you see if you like it.  That was very expensive to throw away.  I tried several ways to make it work.  I thought I would never get the fishy smell out of my sink even after bleaching it, there was that fishy smell.  If you love the way fish smells this is for you but be aware of all of this before you order!

review/text: As someone who has to be vigilant about food intake, I am always looking for substitutes for items I can't eat.  As such, these noodles were great!<br /><br />No, it is not real pasta.  And yes, you have to rinse the noodles to remove the fishy smell.  And the texture is a liitle weird.  But up until trying these, I probably have had 3 servings of pasta in the past 10+ years.  I rinse (alot!), cook like regular noodles, then add low-fat parm cheese, garlic powder, basil and butter flavored spray.  I've also added grilled chicken.  The savings in calories is tremendous and for me, well worth the difference in taste.  YMMV.

review/summary: Different, not unpleasent, but not a treat either
review/text: I bought these because I'm a sucker for low calorie carbs. I just loves my rice, noodles, pasta, etc.and thought these would be a great substitute.  These are a no calorie substitute, but like substituting tofu for meat, the taste is in the myriad of ingredients you cook them with. They have no taste on their own and a rather obnoxiously slimy texture. The fishy smell you get when you open a package quickly dissipates with rinsing in cold water, they firm up a little with a quick parboil, but on their own they are BLAH. I have stir fried them and boiled them for soup with veggies, garlic, sauces, you name it. They aren't worth the effort. I will continue to stir fry and boil veggies, but I probably won't bother with these "noodles" again. A Tofurkey will never be a turkey and these will never satisfy a noodle craving.

review/text: Ordered these after watching a TV Shopping Channel presentation. Much better price on Amazon. I found the taste to be very disagreeable, and will not be ordering them again!

review/summary: Miracle Noodles
review/text: These noodles made me very ill.  As far as taste, they do NOT absorb flavor at all.  The sauce just sits right on top and does not penetrate the noodle.  Also, the texture is very strange.  In any case, I would have continued to eat them if they had not made me ill.  The seller refused to take back the four packages that were left.  I was very unhappy with this purchase.

review/summary: these taste pretty awful
review/text: I had a really difficult time choking these down. It'd be great if they made noodle 1/2 from this and 1/2 from a grain. Still b half the calories and actually edible. i guess if your desperate and not too picky of an eater these could work for you.

review/summary: Nasty
review/text: I was so excited to find these noodles.  When I opened the package the smell of old fish smacked me in the face.  I hoped it would get better after cooking them, but it didn't.  The texture was like chewing plastic.  Not real sure why you would eat these.

review/summary: just plain nasty
review/text: If you don't mind substituting flavorless, rubbery "noodles" for real noodles then these are for you. The consistency almost induced gagging. I'd rate them zero stars if that was an option.<br /><br />I'll stick with real pasta, in moderation.

review/summary: Follow the directions
review/text: If you follow the directions on the bag the smell should not be an issue after cooking. The texture is not unlike some rice noodles I've had at Chinese restaurants. In my opinion they are pretty tasty depending on how you season or sauce them. I will buy more in the future.

review/summary: perfect for stir-fry!
review/text: I followed the simple directions on the package and added the noodles to a stir-fry that I made. The noodles took on the tastes of the ginger, garlic, sesame oil, and soy sauce that I used in the dish. They were wonderful! I didn't find them rubbery or fishy at all. I highly recommend them!

review/text: It's like eating a somewhat chewy rubber band. I couldn't get it to absorb ANY flavor.  I soaked it in various sauces for a couple of days in the fridge and it still had no flavor.

review/summary: Surprisingly not bad!
review/text: I wasn't looking for taste comparable to handmade Italian pasta. I was really just looking for noodles I could use in Asian soups and the occasional spaghetti-type dish. I've used these noodles for both and they turned out great. And by great, I mean they didn't add any funky flavor, they're weren't slimy or mealy, they had the texture of real noodles. In fact, they didn't have much flavor at all, and I'm fine with that as they soak up whatever flavor is around them. And they have no calories. That's a miracle.<br /><br />One thing--remember to rinse them in a colander or strainer first because they smell a little funky right out of the package.<br /><br />If you're on the fence on trying these noodles because you're worried they're going to taste weird or have a nasty texture, they really don't. Go for it.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I am amazed at how these noodles taste like whatever you want them to taste like. I like pasta but have never really craved it because it is SO heavy to me. I feel like napping after eating regular pasta and feel SO bloated. These are just what I needed to help me get through my HCG diet. They are so filling, yet light and very tasty. If you rinse them well, boil them for one minute then drain for a minute or so on some paper towels they are terriffic!!! You can really make some great dishes with these. Spaghetti, chicken noodle soup, just mix with veggies, whatever. I think they are wonderful and I will always have some on hand. They are very very filling and have no calories, fat, carbs...nothing!

review/summary: good for low carb diet
review/text: This noodle works the best with my low carb diet. I always have a hard time thinking of what I can eat when I am on my low card diet. I can be satisfied because I am eating noodles and I will be sticking to my low carb diet. The noodles taste great. Easy to cook.
