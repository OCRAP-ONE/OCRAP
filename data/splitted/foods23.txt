review/summary: Snyder's Best Flavor
review/text: I was starting to think that Snyder and I just didn't share the same idea about what's good in snack flavors. I have tried several of their other pretzel pieces flavors (Buffalo Wing and Honey Mustard) and was very disappointed. I have to say, that these Cheddar Cheese flavor pieces are not just good, but spectacularly good! They have a very rich, buttery cheese flavor with pleasant yeasty aftertaste. These are totally addictive. It's very easy to munch through the entire large bag in one setting.

review/text: My husband is a pretzel lover and has become addicted to these. I don't see the draw, being firmly in the potato chip camp myself, but to each his own. Our local stores only stock these occasionally, so he has tried all the other flavors, and while he does like the jalapeno, they don't like him back. It's nice to be able to buy them here and not have to run all over town looking for them.

review/summary: A favorite quick meal solution
review/text: When we get very busy in our home, I like this sausage a lot for quick meal options. The flavor is a bit sweet, and works well with lots of types of vegetables. Usually I'll slice it lengthwise and saute it until done, then add sweet potatoes,potatoes and onions to the pan to make up a skillet. With a bit of cheese on top it's all the food groups in a one pan meal that my family enjoys. Mac and cheese with peas and sausage mixed in is another option that my daughter is crazy for. For that I cut the sausage into coins and cook it up, then make up the homemade mac and cheese as usual, add frozen peas and the sausage and finish cooking. The sweetness of the sausage with the salty of the cheese is good and it's just so easy to make.

review/summary: A Staple in my house
review/text: I use these to keep my finicky toddler's protein levels up. What's great, is that they're delicious just about any way you can imagine cooking a sausage!<br /><br />A favorite Recipe: Sautee one large onion, about a tablespoon each dried basil and oregano, and some salt and pepper in about 2T of butter. Add sausage, that's been cut into coins, and russet potatoes cut into 1/4" thick rounds. Cover all with chicken stock and simmer until potatoes are soft but not dissolved. Throw in a few handfuls of pre-washed baby spinach (I usually use about a half a pound, and frozen would work fine, just put it in a minute earlier). Stir until the spinach is cooked, and then serve! Enjoy!

review/text: Having recently purchased a single cup coffee maker, we discovered Green Mountain and their delicious varieties of coffee.  I love the Island Coconut flavor so much it is now a staple in our household with all other flavors taking a 2nd seat.  The roast of the coffee is wonderful and really lets the coconut shine through.  Try it with a little Chocolate Coffee Mate Creamer and you'll swear you were having a decadent treat straight from the Islands...  YUM!!!

review/summary: Flavor didn't work for me; back to Honey Nut
review/text: I was really looking forward to the Dulce de Leche Cheerios.  The Honey Nut flavor has been my favorite since they came out and the thought of caramel was quite appealing.<br /><br />The first few spoonfuls seemed quite yummy.  But the more I ate, the less I enjoyed it.  The caramel flavor seemed a bit off to me or maybe it was that these are more corn than oat so the flavor was different from that as well.  (Oats are the third ingredient after corn and sugar; I thought Cheerios were always oat cereals.) All things considered (especially price), I'll stick with Honey Nut.<br /><br />They tasted pretty good just plain from the box so I think I'll save them for when I want a slightly sweet snack but not too sugary.  I'll pour out a handful and eat them like a toddler!<br /><br />I expected these to be more sugary than the Honey Nut but these have 6 grams of sugar per serving compared to 9 grams for the Honey Nut.  But they have the same total carbohydrates, 22 grams per serving, so there isn't much difference in how it affects your body.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I won't buy them again.

review/summary: Guilt Free YUMMMMM!
review/text: I have a sweet tooth and so does my three year old son. This is a great after dinner dessert that I feel good about giving him and myself. They ARE healthy and you CAN taste the flax seed in them, but I have really grown to love that healthy taste and texture. I even come to crave it now. They are satisfying and filling and my whole family loves them. I buy them in bulk and love other Hodgson Mill products as well.<br /><br />  If you eat nothing but white flour products and can't get used to or absolutly hate whole grains and their taste and texture, then this is not the product for you. If you are the family that tries to make healthy choices and have healthier alternitives then this is a wonderful product. I still love to have my junk food (Pillsbury and Hershey's here I come!!!) I just try to have it only on very special occasions. The rest of the time I choose to nurish my body and satisfy my taste buds. That is when I reach for this brownie mix.<br /><br />  My only complaint is that they don't taste too great after only a couple days. So make up a batch, eat em' up quick (within 2 days) and you will be smiling!

review/summary: Healtier, but not guilt-free...
review/text: My kids love brownies, but I could no longer by the regular brands in the grocery store with a good conscious.  I still wanted the convenience of a mix, though.  These fit the bill.  They first time I made them, they thought they tasted "funny" because they were so used to the processed crap.  Now they eat them up and have gotten used to the flax taste.  I think they are YUMMY!<br />These are in no way low-calorie or low-fat though.  Instructions call for a lot of oil, eggs, and butter (you can use Earth Balance and egg replacer if you're vegan).  Flax seeds also have a good amount of fat (although the healthy kind). I've made them with olive oil before and they were just as good.  I've also added extra organic cocoa powder to make them extra chocolatey, but they really don't need it.  I love the chewy texture of the flax seeds.  There are very few ingredients, I could probably make the same brownies homemade, but it would be a pain to have to grind the flax seeds, etc.  These are easy and yummy.  Even though they are not necessarily "healthy" from a calorie and fat standpoint, I can feel good about giving my kids treats that aren't loaded with processed crap.

review/summary: Higher fiber, yet tasty... especially if you add mini-chips
review/text: For quite a while, before Amazon starting retailing food items, it was nearly impossible to locate this healthy underground-favorite brownie mix. There were blogs and food sites bemoaning how hard it was to locate.  So when we saw it on Amazon we ordered a case and baked up batches for all our friends and family. The concensus was: it tastes healthier but, never the less, quite good. It is far better when prepared with at least a cup of mini-chocolate chips. (Not regular chips which can sink to the bottom.) We buy good quality Belgian chocolate minichips. This mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures.

I've been a baker for 35 years and love to try new recipes.<br /><br />i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results: the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth.  I can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the box<br /><br />one of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well.<br /><br />i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch.  a little bit of time required... a little less convenient but brownies being a treat (and comfort food), the texture should be right :)

review/text: I always start my son on this tea when he starts a cold. He actually now asks for it. I prepare it and put it in a thermo for him to drink during the day at school. It works wonders when he starts drinking it right away when the symptoms are obvious. The throat does heal from this tea. If he starts it after the illness has taken full course, it still helps it sooth it a lot. My son loves it and I have recommended to other friends who now buy it all the time. Great effective results!!!

review/summary: Wonderful Healthy Snack for Baby!
review/text: We just got our first order a few days ago, and my 10 month old daughter loves them! They're just like the Gerber mini veggies, but much cheaper. Although they still cost a good bit, having a nutrient filled, easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it. My daughter doesn't have any teeth yet, and she hasn't had any problems eating them. They're light and fluffy, yet full of flavor.

review/text: I don't know why my toddler is so crazy about these, but he is.  He was snacking on so many cheerios every day that I was desperate to find something else that he would like but wouldn't require refrigeration, and this saved the day.  I feel good about feeding him healthier snacks and he is positively in love with these!

review/summary: Flavor & texture not good in this batch
review/text: I've been buying these for nearly 5 years and this is the fiirst time that my son has refused to eat them. They are darker green than usual, which was not a problem, but the texture was chewier and the flavor wasn't as good. This is a problem since it's the only vegetable my son eats and he has severe feeding issues. The taste & texture were so different he was gagging. Not pleased with the change.

review/summary: Great toddler snack; inconsistent quality
review/text: My 22-month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food.  They are tasty, healthy, and have zero additives.  On the downside, every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking ROCK.  I can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth, so I worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth.  That being said, it's been months and nothing bad has happened...and it hasn't worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas, it's just something that I feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product.

review/text: I like the dried peas from Just tomatoes and I also like their Just Corn.  They are way too expensive though.  They are really handy because I don't use frozen or canned foods because I follow an Ayurvedic diet which prohibits them.  When I can not find fresh peas I have to use these.  I will probably have to do without as I can't afford these, too bad.

If you can dream it you can do it.<br /><br />The bacon flavor is not over powering, it is a subtle delicious taste.  I love Davis & Davis products and will be trying different varieties for sure.

review/text: For serious goat cheese lovers, this is a step up from the French goat cheese that you can buy at the grocery store. I had never had smoked goat cheese before and this was a revelation: the creamy, smooth, a little sour taste went fabulously well with the smoke flavor. I used it sprinkled over a tomato, bean and romaine salad and also spread on toast points topped with an apple-zucchini relish from the 101 cookbooks blog. Outstanding artisan cheese that I look forward to enjoying again.

review/summary: Very delicious coffee!
review/text: I have a history of mild/moderate acid reflux, so I take it easy with coffee. I was delighted to discover Puroast, which is a reduced acid coffee that is reasonably priced. The French Roast flavor is utterly delicious. It tastes like I went to a coffee house for fancy coffee, but it's just brewed in my drip coffee pot in my kitchen. (Even more convenient if my husband does it for me!) Try it - you won't be disappointed. The cinnamon flavor is also very, very good.

review/text: I struggle between giving this 3 or 4, even 5 stars - because I am just thankful for the substitute, as I have a condition that I need low acid coffee for. However, I DO have to admit, it tastes like burnt coffee (as someone else put it) and it is no Peets or Starbucks. The taste, and the flavor it leaves in your mouth after you are done, is something I don't think I will ever get used to.<br /><br />Update: I had my father in law up. Would like to say that if you are one, like he is, that puts mounds of creamer and sugar in your coffee...apparently you will not notice a difference in taste from this brand to another. Hope that helps!

review/text: I love, love, love dark roasted coffee and don't like a acid taste so I thought this would be great,<br /><br />I was pleased with the 'no acid taste," but...I had to use twice as much to get the same flavor I usually like. That wouldn't be a big deal- but it meant I went through the coffee faster than I should have and that can get expensive.<br /><br />This blend was ground very finely so would not be good with a french press. I was able to use it with a pour over.

review/summary: A Good News, Bad News Situation for Low-Acid Drinkers
review/text: A short while ago, my doctor looked me in the eye and said, "Buddy, you got acid reflux real bad."  (My dentist said the same - only he was able to make his announcement a bit more colorful by showing `worst case scenario' pictures of teeth on battery acid. He put me off coffee for a week.)  So, with that double-whammy in mind, I've lately been trying to cut back on acidic foods.  Hence my decision to go the low-acid coffee route.<br /><br />And like the headline says, this coffee is a good news bad news situation.<br /><br />First, the good news: Puroast Coffee does in fact appear to be legitimately low-acid.  I've noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it.<br /><br />Now, the bad news: this coffee is kinda bad.  I should note, this isn't the opinion of a coffee snob:  while I like a good cup of Peet's Coffee as much as the next guy, I'm a-okay with a batch of Folger's or the basic house brand of whatever chain store I happen to be shopping in.  I'm usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isn't highway robbery.<br /><br />Alas, for all of its low acidity (and decent price), this coffee ain't that pleasant kick start.  There's an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe - other than to say that Puroast doesn't really taste like French Roast coffee.  Even doctored up with cinnamon and milk, the unpleasant flavor remains.<br /><br />So yes, this coffee is effective, if you absolutely need to have coffee.  But if you're looking for a pleasant, low acid kick start to your day, black tea might be a better, tastier option.

I still prefer the taste of Starbucks houseblend but now I'm not sure the extra body is worth the acid. This is a good alternative that i found i liked better and better as i got use to it.

review/text: This coffee smells really bad - there is definitely no "delicious" smell as it brews or as you take sips from your mug.  It tastes just as awful too.  The first couple sips that I had, with my nose closed so I couldn't smell it, wasn't too bad but the more sips I took the more disgusting it was.  It is absolutely stomach turning (to me at least) and unfortunately I will never drink the whole bag. It tastes like a weak, poorly brewed, cheap cup of coffee (though not cheap!).  The only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder - just irritated my nose and taste buds.

review/text: I must admit when I first ordered this bread for my new Panasonic bread maker, I was not expecting anything other than potato bread such as I buy at a nearby store. However, was I ever surprised! It was absolutely the best stuff and with some organic butter piled high and properly melted it was on a par with ambrosia. I just could not believe how good it was and is. Since the first loaf, I have made other breads which have been generally excellent but none are quite at the level of this potato bread. It is REALLY good! Perhaps the credit goes to my new bread machine! Highly recommended!!!  GENERAL INFO: The package makes a 1.5 pound loaf. On my machine the recommended setting is BASIC and the loaf bakes in 4 hours. Also, the flour is NON GMO Verified as labelled.

review/summary: Hodgson Potato Bread
review/text: I am so totally satisfied by Hodgson Mill products & I probably have purchased > 100 loaves at this point.  I used some as a present to my brother with good results, too.<br /><br />Never have I seen "old" smelling mix nor have I ever had a yeast failure.  Their taste & texture is wonderful. Never have I had a "slicing failure" where you can't get a slice to hold together long enough to lay it down. The different types lend themselves well to adding ingredients such as Chopped Nuts or Sesame Seeds or Millet Seed or - - use your own imagination.  Coming in nice units of 6 loaves makes pantry storage easy, and once opened, the carton yields 6 boxes with "Best By" dates easily accessible on each so rotating your shelf stock is almost "goof-proofed".<br /><br />Next time you walk a grocery store, note the prices there! Here again, I think you really can't beat the quality with a really fair price that Hodgson provides.  It seems to me that they have expended great effort to have the best product they can produce & the best shipping available for their customers.<br /><br />Buy with great confidence based on my experiences with them during the last 2-3 years.  I hope this helps decision making.

review/text: I love this bread.  I don't even like the smell of commercial bread; you can smell the chemicals from miles.  I added rosemary, garlic and olive oil to the mix and serve it just out of the machine; it was a hit with my dinner guests.

review/summary: potato bread mix
review/text: I was a little disappointed...I first made the muffins with it and then let the bread machine make and bake a loaf - ok.  Next I will try mixing it myself and baking in my oven.  I do have to keep in mind though that potato bread is dense and heavier than say white bread.  Convenient is a plus.

review/summary: My Fave Hodgson Mill Bread Mix!
review/text: I have tried a few of this brand of bread mix in my bread machine and while all have been good I must say to my family and I that this is the best! I have made potato bread from scratch in my bread machine and this is right up there with that. Nice flavor, great texture, well worth the price! I have bought this a few times on Amazon and will continue to do so!

review/summary: Hodgson Mill Bread Mix Products
review/text: I am extremely satisfied with both Hodgson Mill Bread Mixes that I purchased online.  The potato bread mix actually rose and stuck to the top of my bread making machine and became entangled in the mixing blade, so it was difficult to remove.  Otherwise, the bread tasted great!!  The Rye bread was also delicious.  It didn'nt rise as much, and I had no trouble removing it from the bread machine.  The rye loaf was much denser than the potato bread loaf.<br /><br />The only drawback to purchasing these products online was the shipping costs.  I have since found out that I can purchase the same brand products at HEB and Kroger grocery stores, and will not order online, again.

review/text: I just got my Bread Machine for Christmas, so being a novice I thought I would try to Keep It Simple :)  The Hodgson Mill Products are wonderful.  Everything is included even the yeast.  The Bread came out delicious, it was easy to slice.  It is like eating a country white bread not soft n mushy like traditional white bread.  My family enjoyed this it makes great toast as well. If you try this I think you will be happy with it

review/text: To the gentleman who reviewed this and said "just go to the store and get better," well, I'm disabled and the disability van only allows us two packages to carry...can you see me carrying two big cases of water home?  I think not.<br /><br />This is wonderful water.  Sure, you could get it on sale at a better price, and if you can drive or have someone to drive you and carry it in, please do so, but for me it is a sweet deal.  I ordered six cases and watched the UPS guy set them inside the door for me.  I have nothing to complain about.  If the price is right for you, with all considered, you won't go wrong here.

review/summary: Good water only comes with a price...
review/text: I continue to buy this water (as well as the larger size bottle) for a number of reasons:<br />1) The taste of the water is just plain good, refreshing, crisp and clean - it's not easy describing water that doesn't actually offend!<br />2) Our filtered municipal water still sucks and this is an excellent alternative for someone with health issues<br />3) The UPS guy does all the heavy work for me - all I have to do is put it away<br />4) I never have to run out of bottled water by availing of the discounted subscribe and save program<br />If I had any complaint at all it would be that the plastic bottle itself is quite heavy and can be a real pain in your backpack.<br />Bottom line for me, the taste and convenience are worth the price and I'll continue to buy it as long as my budget allows.**UPDATED note** I've been drinking this water for four months now and had an interesting experience that bears sharing: my local Kroger had Ozarka Spring Water on sale so I picked up a case - wow was that ever a mistake. Even though the Ozarka bottles are very light weight, the taste of the water is so different from TalkingRain Spring Water in that there is a distinct "plasticy" flavor. I've alway enjoyed the Ozarka in the past but had no idea I was settling for drinking "plastic" water...my goodness how my taste buds and senses have changed since drinking the pure goodness on TalkingRain Spring Water...I am totally convinced it is worth the extra cost now.

review/summary: Best water ever.
review/text: I am a chemist, so I know about water, and why it can taste like heaven (e.g. it is tasteless), and why it can taste like sweat (e.g. "mineral-enhanced."). This water is expensive - cheap for online, but costly if you are a Walmart or Target shopper. However, I highly recommend you try this, if you want tasteless water. You see, when water is mineral enhanced, and its swirling around through the various protrusions and undulations the road provides in the summer heat, the water tends to build a certain taste, which some like, and others don't. I like my water tasteless. Therefore I recommend this product to those whom do not want H2O + minerals, but just plain water.

review/text: Water tastes good. I typically prefer only purified water (did a study on this in grad school back in the day) but for use at the office, this fills the bill. I think it tastes good and looks presentable.<br /><br />Bottles are (of course) recyclable, so I don't feel guilty saying I like the quality of the bottle as well. I once had someone pickup water, and they got a chain grocer brand at a steal - but the bottle was so flimsy. I don't like that one bit. This is the best of both worlds.<br /><br />Shipment arrived fully intact for me.

review/summary: 30 bottles instead of the usual 24
review/text: Always glad to see this water delivered to our doorstep. Not a drop of it spilled during delivery yet, due to  nice quality of  bottles.<br />Even though the delivery box itself has arrived bashed in, with the tape flopping, - must say the shrink wrapping has held, and the bottles themselves haven't spilled a drop of the water.<br />  We're on our third case of  it right now, and very happy with this purchase.  The water tastes good and the bottles hold their shape.<br /><br /> About weight  of these bottles commented upon in another review... I thought the comment was interesting and it reminded me that yes, I do drive a few bottles to work in the car, I don't backpack them.  Not a really obvious difference in weight, though, I think. Maybe necessary for shipping?<br /><br />  Guess it's like choosing sleeping bags...if you are using a vehicle, you can  use a heavier sleeping bag, so they tell me.<br /> Anyway, I think you'll like this water, and you get 30 bottles per case, instead of the usual 24.<br />We plan to order more.  We're glad we can do this.

review/text: This water is really good!!!!!  It is reasonably priced!!!  It is mountain spring water!!!  Please order at least once, you will not regret it.  It is priced right.  You get 30qt---16.9 ounce bottles for a great price.  Use your standard shipping 5 to 8 days (i think) free shipping.  That way, you can buy more product.  Be aware, that this is very popular product and sometimes, Amazon is out of stock.  So, you may have to wait 2 or 3 weeks.  BUT, it is worth the wait.  It is a great product!!!!

review/text: I bought this water when i was at college for the first week. I felt bad using my roommate's water all the time and i was 7 states away from home. So i ordered this water. It was delicious, but the only complaint i have is that the bottles were REALLY...well...plastic-y. I felt really un-green drinking water out of these HUGE plastic bottles.<br /><br />So now, i just ask my roommate to buy water for me when she goes home on the weekends. I give her $ 4, she runs to walmart and gets me 2 cases of 30 water bottles. Yay me!<br /><br />Sometimes i still think about this water, longing for it as i sip my coffee or tea or ramen-juice and say to myself "This would be so much better with talking rain."<br /><br />Its one college student's battle between deliciousness and eco-friendliness.

review/summary: Cloudy means impurities!
review/text: Yes the water appears clear, but once the water is heated for tea it turns the tea cloudy. Why is that, well it means it has impurities. Perhaps bacteria?? I'm a Registered Nurse not a water expert, but I can tell you that I am right about the water. I can run my well water from my tap and get the same results, it's awful.  I normally use Brita filters with the pitcher provided and when I heat or even boil the water the tea stays clear. This Means no bacteria have been killed off by the heating process, it means you'd be better off drinking the Brita water!!!!!! I gave this bottle water a chance I got a second case and the same thing happen. I wouldn't drink this water straight from the bottle ever. As a nurse I know it's not a good idea.  If you ever want to know if water is good or clear of bacteria/impurities you can make Lipton tea hot then, as it cools down IF the tea turns very cloudy it has dead bacteria and other impurities. I used the ice cubes made from this bottled water as well, so nothing is different except the tea.  Tried the Brita water and Brita made ice cubes and it remained clear.  Sorry not a good review from me I am afraid.<br /><br /> I was very disappointed as I thought "yeah" a bottled water I can carry to work, so I am not force to pay $1.50 for a bottle from the machine, but it turn out not to be so.<br /><br />Okay, so I tried another company on this website Nestles which in my region came as Deer Park. I have never tried this brand but it is so much better it doesn't,t turn cloudy when I boil it.  So you be you own judge.

Coffee usually tears up my stomach so I've been a tea drinker for years, but this coffee has a low-acidic level so I can handle it. The aroma is enticing and the bag lasted a long time. I am a fan of beans versus grounds so that was another plus. It was prompt and the packaging ensured my coffee stayed fresh and intact.

Ingredient says "Fruit Juice Blend (Organic White Grape Juice, Organic Apple Juice And Organic Pineapple Juice From Concentrate, Organic Mango Puree."<br /><br />I cancelled order as soon as I realized this drink had grape and pineapple.
