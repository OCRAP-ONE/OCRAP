review/summary: These are a favorite in my house
review/text: We all loved them, they taste great, not too sweet and the chocolate chips are amazing. I love the consistancy too. However, I get them through subscribe and save, so I received a couple a stale shipments in the past. It's just something to be aware of, but if my next shipment is disapointing, I'll cancel my subscription and buy them fresh at Whole Foods.

review/summary: Unbelievably good!
review/text: I usually don't write food reviews because, well, 'one man's meat is another man's poison', as the saying goes. We actually stumbled upon these cookies. On a whim, I picked up a package marked for clearance at Target and, since then, my daughter and I have been fighting over it. Unfortunately, I can no longer find them at Target so I guess we will now have to buy in packs of 6 through Amazon. Never mind, I suppose I can store them in the cool basement.<br /><br />We try to not eat too many in a day as 2 cookies will cost you 130 calories (so this pretty much means eating only 2 cookies per day!). I am very sensitive to food additives and can always detect the chemicals in some 'natural' foods (e.g. Kashi). One bite and I could tell that there are none in these cookies. Also important was that it is just gently sweet; most off-the-shelf cookies are much too sweet for me. Think I'm also going to try Back to Nature's Graham Cookies through Amazon since it's got some rave reviews! I'm definitely sold on this brand.

review/text: When my favorite local grocery store was purchased by a larger chain, they did not continue to carry these; they are my favorite breakfast at work.  And the auto shipment feature through Amazon makes the cost comparable to what I paid for these at the local store.  Thanks, Amazon, for offering options!

review/text: The cookies have a great flavor.  Love the texture of the filling. With the 6 pk. I put mine in the fridge but doubt if they will be around long enough to get stale.  The peanut butter and crisp cookie combo  is hard to resist. If you love peanut butter don't miss out on this treat.

review/summary: Healthier Cookie With A Decadent Taste!
review/text: Fresh... six boxes... with a sell by date at least 4 months away. The sell by date is important in a product that says it's all natural!<br />The boxes say 100% Natural and are packaged in at least 55% recycled packaging.<br /><br />No artificial preservatives, flavors or colors. No high fructose syrup. No hydrogenated oils.<br /><br />The cookies are delicious!<br />A nice crunchy cookie with a semi-sweetish tasting peanut butter filling. The cookies taste like wheat more than the white bread side of things. Two cookies is supposed to be a serving size... I'm sorry to say... the first two times I had them... I couldn't stop at two!<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthier peanut butter cookie... with a decadent taste... look no further... you've found it!<br />I highly recommend these cookies.<br /><br />They're a bit pricey to be serving for children's snacks on a regular basis... but I would probably hide them in the top cabinet... lock it... lol... and bring them out in portion size servings for the children. :)

review/summary: The Perfect Peanut Butter Cookie!
review/text: This cookie reminds me of one of those girl scout cookies, but without all the nasty stuff! This is the perfect companion to a cup of hot tea! Perfectly baked, not too sweet, and seriously addictive! I had a box in the pantry, and my daughter, son-in-law, & husband finished them off in 2 days!<br /><br />Warning: this is not a health food. At 130 calories & 5g fat for 2 cookies, you won't want to sit with the unopened box because you WILL want more than just 2! So just take out 1 or 2 cookies, seal up the box, & savor the yumminess!

review/summary: Peanut Butter Cookies
review/text: These cookies were delivered on time and the package was as described.<br />We usually buy these cookies from a discount warehouse store but they ran out.  The package from the discounter is slightly different from the Amazon.com supplier but the cookies are the same.  After totaling the price and shipping we found that it costs less to purchase from the warehouse store when they have them.  It is more expensive to buy these cookies on-line than to buy them in the store.  Nevertheless my son enjoys the cookies and we are satisfied.

review/text: I have been trying to eat better and am switching from some of the foods I used to eat to healthier choices.  While fresh fruits and vegetables are wonderful, sometimes I really just need that sweet treat.  I also have a teenage daughter who packs her lunch or dinner on long marching band days and I wanted a healthier alternative for her.<br /><br />These peanut butter cookies are GREAT!  They are very similar to the girl scout cookies that I grew up on (and continue to adore).  Wonderful flavor, all-natural ingredients, and very filling.  I can eat 2 or 3 of these as a dessert and feel like I got my "fix".<br /><br />Well worth the money ---

I will definitely buy more of these and would be proud to serve to family and friends. My only gripe is it contains soy.

review/summary: Honey Graham Sticks
review/text: This review is for the Honey Graham sticks.  My son was diagnosed in 2010 with food allergies and I immediately set out to find foods he could enjoy.  It was not easy.  Some foods that don't use corn based sweeteners taste horrible- I am so happy to say that this is not one of those.  These crackers are SO good, we often run out before our next shipment comes.  There are usually 13 sticks in each pack (we've used them in math lessons quite a few times, my son gets quite a kick out of eating his work!), so not a lot, but a nice little snack for a child.  We love them with the JIF peanut butter cups to go or plain.  They are way better than Honeymaid or Keebler grahams!

You'll be disappointed, too, if you buy them looking for a yummy Oatmeal cookie, they taste more like "Ranger" cookies (e.g. Krogers).  They do taste good and make a fine snack, but they should have called them something else, as I'm sure many will be disappointed.<br /><br />Still, now that I know what they taste like, I might buy them again if they go on sale.

It makes me feel a little better when giving these to our children as a treat. As long as the company keeps these on "the shelf", we will keep buying them. As a matter-of-fact, to make sure we don't run out and that I wont forget to order these, we have them on "auto ship". The bonus to doing that is we get a 15% discount on them! How awesome is that?!!

They are expensive in my local health food store so I was happy to find them here at such a great price.  The auto-ship is perfect for the cookie monsters in my house.  I only wish Amazon would find a better way to ship them.  They do often come a little banged up for my liking.<br /><br />Try them!  If you like Nutter Butters I think you will like these.  You should at least like the fact that they are made with ingredients you can actually pronounce!

review/text: I purchase the snacks for my department and it's hard to think what everyone would like. Who doesn't like chocolate chip cookies? I chose these because of their organic ingredients and the price. The cookies are not pretty, in fact the first co-worker to try them named them the "ugly cookies" but guess what she loves them. She hides them in her desk drawer. Everyone agrees they have good chocolate taste and despite their unattractive appearance of non uniformity and chunkiness they are tasty. Don't let the cover fool you.

review/text: My family loves these beans and I have ordered them before. The first shipment had 2 or 3 cans with small dents. My last order had 9 of 12 cans that were severely dented. This did not happen in shipping. The box was in good condition and packaged well by Amazon. Most of the dents are on the inside cans of the package.It seems that they come this way from the manufacturer. Amazon is sending me a replacement case and I hope they are in better shape.<br /><br />UPDATE: My replacement case came and 11 of 12 cans have dents. Amazon has refunded my money. I contacted Walnut Creek and they said they only sell Amazon first quality products and they are not sure how the cans are getting dented. I would not suggest purchasing these beans from Amazon.

If it tastes worse it is usually better for you.  These taste kinda bland and raw.  I like Bush's better.  Itt has a much better taste.

review/summary: Severely bent cans. Amazon needs to adopt a policy of full disclosure.
review/text: The cans I received were severely bent. This did not happen in shipping. The box was in good condition and packaged well. Amazon needs to indicate the condition of the canned good they are selling (or at least mention the possibility of the cans being bent, because it is starting to appear from the number I have received that they are selling damaged canned goods). I had to throw one of the cans away since the product in it smelled off.

review/text: There are many Lebkuchen out there, even original German ones, but not all are equal, these from E. Otto Schmidt are the best by far. I grew up in Germany and I pretty much know and tasted most of them since I was a little child, you just can't go wrong with the Quality of this company and the customer service (if you buy directly from them). My dad is sending them to me every year now from Germany to the US and one time the delivery person (think it was FedEx) left them out in the snow and the carton got very soggy and some of the content got a little moist inside. I just emailed them and told them what happened just to let them know and they actually send me another box, no further questions asked. That kind of service is almost unheard of nowadays.

review/text: Discovered this wonderful sauce at a Costco Road Show special in Palm Desert. Used to buy it at the factory store in San Diego, but moved out of the area. Having available through Amazon (especially with free Prime Shipping!) is great! If you ever get to meet old Smokin' Joe himself at a show, you will be smiling all day. I prefer the Spicy, but the regular and mild are equally good. Doesn't burn on the BBQ due to the low or no sugar and gives a wonderful flavor to everything you grill

review/summary: bread machine mixes
review/text: I've made a lot of bread in my day, worked my way through college in a bakery from 1100 to 0300 hrs, and this is one of the easiest and best sourdough breads that I've ever made.  Caution:  I recommend that unless you are an experienced baker, use the "basic" bread machine setting on your machine.  It always comes out perfect and tastes just like you would buy in San Francisco.  You can make it by hand, but unless you know what you are doing the results are less then the excellent product that will come out of your bread machine.  This mix is equal to your own sourdough starter made bread, and that is saying something in this day and age.  A terrific product if you like sourdough bread and do not live in Northern California.  (Oh yes, have to add that you  need to make sure the water you use is at specifically 80 degrees.  Warm tap water will do the trick too.)

review/text: Before my breadmaker arrived I tried this mix by the Kitchenaid Standmixer, the dough was very sticky, so I've had to add more breadflour. Eventhought the dough was still sticky and I've let them rise almost 4 hours before baking, it came out of the oven very dry and it tasted sour... so so... not really good. The second mix I put in the breadmaker and just let the breadmaker do his job, it came out very good , the taste is perfect. If you have a breadmaker and you like sourdoug bread, you should try this mix

review/text: I bought couple bags of these a while back just intended to use them for Sambar soup, the south Indian breakfast soup. But I have been using it in many other types of dishes, whether they're pan fry dishes of any meat of fish or soup dishes to spice things up here and there, even to spice up canned chilli. A little sprinkle per dish goes a long way. And the two bags lasted more than a year now.  It tastes better than just typical curry powder. If you use it sparingly, it doesn't just make the dish completely like a curry dish, but adds more depth to the dish flavor.

review/summary: Super flavor with great ingredients!
review/text: Since my daughter is allergic to all artificial food dyes we are always looking for new products that she can have.  This not only met our expectations it blew us away!  The flavor is not too sweet, nor is there any strange after-taste.  Very tasty!  This was the first flavor we tried, now we are going to try all of the rest but in the larger bottles.  The bottle is supposed to make about 28 servings at about $5.99 per bottle, so a much better value. We liked them so much that we went through the packets pretty quickly.  The packets are a liquid, not a powder so mix very quickly and are handy.  I think we'll end up getting them off the Flavrz website though since they also have gingerale, rootbeer, cola and many other flavors not available here.  I think that they will also make great freezer pops and sno-cones!

review/summary: Good stuff but too expensive
review/text: We ordered with a discount via Amazon automatic purchase option, but it still works out to $0.57 per packet.  We make our own carbonated water and wanted a low calorie, but not artificially sweetened flavoring option.  This fits the bill nicely.  The flavor is quite good and you can split each packet in half to adequately flavor about 6 ounces of water.  However, at the equivalent of $0.57 per "can" the price kills the deal.  It is the same cost as buying high quality soda at the grocery store.  There is another option to buy in bottles which makes more dollars and sense on the surface, but shipping wipes out the cost advantage.  Bottom line, like the product, but won't be buying more due to the price.

I prefer the 12 ounce dilution that gives you fruit juice (it is not too sweet), to the 20 ounce flavored water which tends to have a bitter edge come out.  Found that they also make wonderful cocktail mixers: over ice Vodka, Cointreau, FlavrZ, and Ginger Ale or Soda water; also mixed with red wine, brandy, & ginger ale makes a great quick Sangria.

review/text: I bought this because I like strong coffee and I figured it must have some merit for Hawke to put his name on it. I was not disappointed! It has a great bold flavor with just the right hint of bitterness, it pours a rich and dusky brown, and it's very strong. The first time I made it was on our new coffee maker, which is too austerely Teutonic for me to use, and I added far too much water. Where any normal coffee might have been watered down into oblivion, Cpt. Hawke's coffee still delivered its promised smoky smoothness. Made too strong, it's like being kicked in the face by a dinosaur (which can help some mornings!), but still goes down smooth and tastes great. For the price, this coffee definitely punches above its weight. It costs less than comparable dark Italian roasts that come in shiny tins and, in the opinion of this coffee drinker, it has more personality. I only wish that Amazon carried the whole bean, as this grind is a little bit too coarse for my French press.

review/summary: Best I've Tried and I've Tried Most!
review/text: The only powdered stevia I like is made by Sugar in The Raw. I've tried Truvia, and whatever else...I can't remember names. I only know that they all left that horrid bitter after taste. Bitter in my drug of choice (coffee!) is NOT something I'm willing to tolerate!! Don't mess with my coffee!<br /><br />I just received some unflavored liquid Stevita. This is the absolute BEST one I've tried. I use it in coffee, oats & cream of wheat. I like sweet, and I've been spending a small fortune on the powdered stuff. The liquid will certainly be more cost effective!<br /><br />If you're not a fan of stevia you might not like it. I've found it to be an acquired taste. As far as taste is concerned I still prefer Equal but aspartame has been giving me digestive issues, I can't even chew gum with it any more! So, Stevita it is!!

review/summary: A Little Goes A Long Way
review/text: I've been using the vanilla flavored for around six weeks now to sweeten my coffee. For me it works so much better than splenda which left me with sugar cravings and an upset stomach. I do have to say that it's an acquired taste though, to me it's very sweet but with a bitter undertone that was a little hard to get used to.

review/summary: great Stevia, but 2x price since August!
review/text: I love this vanilla-flavored Stevita brand Stevia -- I bought 10 bottles back in August! I was just going to repeat my order today when I found the price nearly doubled! ($2.95 then to $5.59 today). So I'm going to take the suggestion in some other reviews and try another brand: Sweetleaf. I think I'll add this brand to my cart as a hold item so Amazon notifies me when & if the price drops again. :)

review/summary: Best no calorie option.
review/text: I really love this brand.  It's much more reasonably priced than some other brands of flavored liquid stevia  (which, granted, I haven't tried but they seem to cost twice and three times as much and I seriously doubt they could taste that much better) If you use too much of it it will have a kind of bite to it but that's true of ALL types and brands of stevia. It's just the nature of the sweetener.  I wouldn't call it a "chemical" taste though, it's more like a bitter plant taste but it's only if you use too much.  It also tends to get lost in hot drinks.  I dont drink coffee but have made hot cocoa with it and ended up adding too much to get it to stand out and the bitterness came through.  HOWEVER we made the most delicious ice cream with it using 10-15 drops per cup (half vanilla, half chocolate).  You can't even tell it's not regular ice cream.  I highly recommend stevia.  It's natural and you dont have to worry about all the scary aspartame stuff which true or not is still kinda creepy and I'd rather not take the risk.  But I particularly like this brand for it's great price.

review/summary: So very bad!
review/text: I've been using ez-sweetz for a while now, but it's almost always sold out on amazon prime.  So, after reading the reviews posted, I decided to try this vanilla stevia.  Dang!  This is the worst tasing stuff known to man.  There is nothing I dislkie more than black licorice, and this stuff is like concentrated licorice in a bottle--so incredibly NASTY there are no other words that come to mind. Oh, and as an added plus--it's not even sweet. Do yourself a favor and get the ez-sweetz.  Really.  This stuff tastes like poision.  I get chills just thinking about it.

review/summary: OVERPOWERING VANILLA, NOT SWEET ENOUGH
review/text: I am a diabetic but without a customery ''sweet tooth'', but need my black decaf SWEET and other non sugar things sweetened.  This is so overpoweringly VANILLA that I can't even use in my coffee and it doesn't even sweeten it enough which is the real purpose for which I bought it.  Just beware.  I couldn't FIND any PLAIN unflavored version of this so picked my favorite flavor, vanilla but too overwhelming.  Was looking for Truvia but saw some negative reviews so tried this meanwhile.  Tasted Stevia over a decade ago and hated it, but wanted to try Truvia to see if it's improved yet and haven't.  I use Sweet & Low tablets and liquid. Dr. Richard Bernstein the diabetic guru, says NEVER use the little envelopes of ANY brand sweetner EXCEPT Stevia, nor powdered 'envelopes' of ANY product which are filled with additives for shelflife that liquids nor tablets have. Just a tip. And I believe EVERYTHING Bernstein says, as I always have about Atkins since a kid, but now the company changed and became more commercial.  Using sweetners all my life with a Diabetic mother... and this is many decades later so sweetners have always been a staple in my life since a child thanks to her.  Those are my credentials lol

review/summary: acquired taste- yum
review/text: My son gave me some of this years ago because he was concerned over my artificial sweetner use (good boy).  I didn't like it and didn't use it-threw it into a drawer.  After I had radiation therapy for cancer, my body would not tolerate my usual sweetner-"you don't want to know the effect"!  I pulled the old (way old)Stevia from the drawer and tried it.  I had no ill effects and found that I actually like it now. I just ordered several bottles of the regular and one of the vanilla.  I do like it and it takes up less space, is easy to take with me in the smaller bottle, and dissolves instantaneously.  I'm convinced that this is my new sweetner and it helps that my body thinks so too.

Sweetleaf brand is the ultimate and you aren't spending more money since it has much richer taste and takes far less...  I keep this bottle I bought in my purse for restaurant uses and it is nice for that purpose since it is light weight and perfect size for purse.  It closes firmly as well.  So it does have it's advantages.

review/summary: Stop Freaking Out Over BPA
review/text: Okay. Im a very cautious parent, but the fact that there is BPA in the lids doesnt affect the food or the quality of it. BPA is an element in plastics that is excess estrogen and its recently become known that its not beneficial to let it enter our bodies. However, BPA is only activated once its been heated and since you arent heating the metal lid, the BPA never enters the food. EB baby food is spectacular especially since its jar food vs frozen/fresh. There are lots of yummy flavors and your baby will probably like most of them. Both of my sons go crazy over the EB varieties and I stick by it- buying it by the case and using the amazon subscription option makes it soo much cheaper than retail! Again... dont freak out over BPA in the lids lol.

I love these over Gerber or Beech-Nut, because they are all natural, no preservatives or hormones. I believe all of the additives and chemicals in our food is the cause for a lot of illnesses that plague our society. Why give your child crap when you don't have to and it is the same price. It also taste good. The bananas are a bit tart, though, but Bella loves them.
