review/text: My kids beg for pop tarts, but since I don't want them to have the  high fructose corn syrup, I say no.  I found thiese and my Kids actually like them better than pop tarts.  The texture is far superior to pop tarts.

review/text: So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the "It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts" speech.<br /><br />Result- my kids eat a lot more cereal.  Even my 2 year old, who eats anything, won't eat them.<br /><br />Personally, I think they're pretty good toasted, not so hot (pun!) un-toasted.  I took 5 boxes to work, and the opinions were universally the same.<br /><br />So, if your satisfaction in eating somewhat healthier outweighs your taste buds, have at 'em!

review/summary: Vigo Octopus is tasty
review/text: Octopus in Olive oil tastes great. Vigo has been using bigger pieces which is good but not as good as the little tentacles they once used. I rip open the can and have instant lunch. My buddies think it's a bit weird, but I love it.

review/text: I have consumed at least 30 tins of Vigo Octopus in olive oil over the last few years. The meat is tasty and firm without being rubbery. I enjoy sashimi octopus and that's the basis of my comparison. The canned meat is not as flavorful or tender as the fresh meat, for sure, but it's thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. I enjoy it occasionally as my protein accompaniment to fresh vegetable or pea soup, or canned tomato soup or lobster bisque, along with some crackers. I have another 20 tins in my pantry right now. In my experience, you an buy this product with confidence.

review/summary: Vigo Octopus works for me
review/text: Very flavorful pieces of octo with a "just-right" chewiness.<br /><br />Pleasing sea-aroma too. Good right out-of-the-can on a picnic or<br />for a snack with crackers or toast.<br /><br />For a great "OCTO-PASTA" I just add a can, and the oil (although you may not want to use all the oil),<br />to a small bowl of warm spaghetti pasta,<br />and sprinkle some grated parmegiana or romano on top. It's delicious.<br />Nice change from marinara sauce.<br /><br />It goes well with salads too--In any dish you'd use shrimp or crab meat.<br />Product of beautiful, sunny Spain.<br /><br />The only complaint--When opening, the can's top pulls back very stiffly and with some difficulty.<br />I use a folded paper towel to protect the hand I hold the can down with,<br />and only pull the top back about half-way.<br />Then I just dump out the contents into a bowl, using a fork<br />to make sure I get every piece out.<br /><br />I'll be ordering another 10 cans quite soon.<br /><br />I'll try to make them last longer than the 1st 10.

review/summary: Very nice surprise!
review/text: I waited until I ate at least one entire can before I reviewed this product. I bought a ten pack and it arrived quickly. I opened a can, no problems with that, I then poured the entire contents of the can in a strainer to remove the extra oil. Then, I heated a non stick pan, put the octopus in the heated pan with salt, black pepper and garlic powder. The octopus is fully cooked in the can so I was heating it up so the flavor would pop.<br />  I heated it on high for 90 seconds. That was plenty of time for the 4 oz you get in one can...it would cover the palm of your hand...I took a fork, ate it and BAM..great flavor, not chewey at all, just tender octopus. I will try it again soon with Hoisin sauce...would I recomend it ...yes.

review/summary: I love Fever-Tree!
review/text: After doing an Internet search for tonic waters that do not contain high-fructose corn syrup, I only found few options. The reviews for Fever-Tree were so positive that I decided to give it a try. They reviews are right: this tonic water is amazing! I happen to prefer vodka tonics to gin and tonics, but the taste of Fever-Tree is so pure that it works with both equally well. My husband prefers G and T's, and he said it has changed the way he views tonic water. What started out as a search for a healthier alternative has actually ended up changing the way we see mixers. I love this tonic water and will be ordering more. With the free shipping, it's actually not much more expensive than Schweppes, especially when you consider that Schweppes goes flat so quickly in the huge liter bottle. Schweppes is also FULL of sodium, and Fever-Tree is not. Check this tonic water out: you'll be glad you did!!

review/summary: The Fever vs. The Q.
review/text: If you are reading this, I hope I don't have to convince you that you should upgrade from the mainstream brands of tonic water with all that 'great' corn syrup and chemicals to a much more premium tonic. Just do it - good tonic water is essential to a good drink and you want to compliment the flavor of your Gin or Vodka - not destroy it. Now the big question that comes up is QTonic or Fever-Tree - which is better? They are both fairly pricey - but both high quality so you get what you pay for. The main difference is that Q uses Agave nectar for sweetness and Fever uses pure cane sugar. There are some other subtle differences, but hat is the main one. So which one is better? Well - your taste buds may vary - but here is my take. The Fever-Tree tastes a bit sweeter to me, though seems to have a better balance of carbonation. The Q has less calories per serving is a bit more neutral in flavor. Both are really good. The Q tends to go better with Vodka while the Fever with Gin - again - just my experiences - your mileage may vary. I recommend getting a 4 pack of both and trying them with your favorite drink. I personally stock both for myself and my guests - I just like the flexibility.

review/text: I fell in love with Indian Tonic Water when in the UK a few years ago.  Not being able to afford having it shipped from the UK, I tried this.  It. Is. Amazing.  Granted, it'll cost you more than a liter bottle of Schweppes and/or Canada Dry tonic water, but it is completely worth it.  Tonic water by itself is now a tasty alternative.  And what it does for my gin and tonics is AH-mazing.<br /><br />I fully recommend you trying this drink for your special event - and then you'll find yourself hoarding bottles for daily use.

Nice and smooth taste, not bitter at all. The 6.8oz size is perfect for one mixed drink. I'm always throwing out partially used 1 liter bottles of tonic water sitting in the fridge, so there's no waste with this size bottle. The free Amazon shipping made this purchase worth it.

review/summary: Best Easily-Available Premium Tonic Water
review/text: My wife and I just performed a taste test of three different tonic waters. We used Bombay Gin in all three to keep the variables to one--the tonic water. We used Schweppes Tonic Water, Q Tonic Water, and Fever-Tree Tonic Water. We thought the Fever-Tree was the best, with Q Tonic second, and Schweppes Tonic a distant third. The Schweppes had a cloying off-taste compared to the other two which we attributed to the high fructose corn syrup which sweetens it. Before we purchased the two premium tonic waters, we thought Schweppes was the best compared to Canada Dry and Seagram's. But the two premium tonic waters were both better. The Q Tonic (sweetened with agave nectar) was less sweet (and lower in calories) than the Fever-Tree (sweetened with cane sugar) and had a distinctly different taste, more subdued compared to Fever-Tree. Both had clean and crisp finishes that were very refreshing. We both thought Fever-Tree had more flavor, especially more citrus flavor, and we preferred it. We will be happy to finish the rest of the case of Q Tonic we bought, but we are going to purchase only Fever-Tree in the future. We prefer gin and tonics with Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray Gins. We tried Fever-Tree with Hendrick's Gin and it was good, better than Hendrick's in martinis, with which we prefer Bombay Sapphire.

review/summary: The best
review/text: I am a wine lover but needed to find something else to drink that isn't so addicting. I discovered that I like a nice vodka and tonic once in a while. One day I looked at the ingredients of the tonic and saw that the evil high fructose corn syrup is No. 1 on the list and knew this is not the alternative I was seeking. While searching the web for info on tonic, I came across Fever Tree Indian Tonic Water with all natural ingredients and decided to give it a try. I ordered a case with free shipping from Amazon which makes the purchase affordable. The taste is superior to all the othere tonics I've tried and at 75 calories per 6.8 oz. bottle, my diet isn't so impacted. I will continue to buy this tonic and recommend it highly.

review/text: A very good and refreshingly light tonic.  I hadn't realized how sugary and heavy Schweppes tasted until I'd had this.  It is very versatile and mixes well with gin and vodka drinks.  I still prefer the Schweppes when I choose to mix a very strong gin/tonic as just a splash of Schweppes is enough to cut it.  This tonic is lighter tasting and needs a bit more volume to cut a strong gin mix (but is fine with strong vodka mixes or light/medium gin pours).<br /><br />I tried Q-tonic as well but that is very bitter.  I found Q-tonic overpowering for vodka and only suitable for some gins in specific ratios.  If there is only one tonic in your fridge, Fever Tree should be it.

review/text: Like many of you, I drank my way through a survey of gins until I found the one that suited me best. (Tanqueray, in my case.) It wasn't until last year that I realized I ought to give tonic--after all, the majority by weight of any G&T--the same respect.<br /><br />Fever Tree beats supermarket tonics for three reasons:<br /><br />1. A taste that is less sugary than Schweppes (etc.) and that foregrounds the quinine bite.<br /><br />2. A level of carbonation between seltzer (too bubbly) and Perier (too flat).<br /><br />3. Packaging that retains carbonation for at least 8 months--which is how long my last 24-pack lasted.

review/summary: The best tonic water
review/text: I have avoided the supermarket brands due to both high fructose corn syrup as well as sodium benzoate in most brands. Polar, at least, doesn't have sodium benzoate, but does have the HFCS.<br /><br />I have tried most of the premium brands, including the so-expensive-it's-simply-unjustifiable brands from that "Whole Paycheck" store, and some that dress up as premium brands but contain the same junk ingredients.<br /><br />Then I found Fever Tree. It's also somewhat pricy; but it's completely natural, and it's absolutely delicious, noticeably and "wow" better than mass supermarket brands.<br /><br />When we have friends over I play bartender, because I make awesome gin and tonics (hint, most bartenders make them far too strong and stir every last bit of fizz out... blech). Recently I made some G&Ts (my favorite/staple cocktail) for friends, but this time used Fever Tree instead of what I had always previously used, Polar. Well, they noticed: "wow, this is great, what's different?"<br /><br />So, I can only recommend Fever Tree Tonic Water. Until/unless they do something to ruin it (hopefully never) count me as a happy customer.

review/summary: The only tonic water worth drinking
review/text: This is an outstanding tonic water.  If you drink premium spirits, you're doing yourself a disservice if you're not accompanying it with Fever Tree.  The flavors are subtle and pure and enhance, rather than drown, the flavors of your favorite gin or tonic.  The absence of a sickly sweetness is what makes this tonic most special, along with the mild notes of quinine and a bitterness that's just notable enough to work.  The premium for this product is worth every penny.<br /><br />Having tried it out with a number of spirits, I've found  this works especially well with Nolet's gin.  If you're going to spend $55 on a bottle of gin, you owe it to yourself to spend $1.25 on a bottle of tonic!

review/summary: Like water off a glacier!
review/text: Every time I crack open one of these bottles and mix with Death's Door gin, I get this image of icy cold liquid from a deep blue glacier. I describe the sensation like having a brain freeze but without the pain. This is a flavor we'd been looking for to take our gin-and-tonics up a step from the corn syrup varieties. We ordered the threesome combination pack first and did comparison taste tests over several days. This brand won out hands down. We then ordered a case and it continues to "not disappoint".

review/summary: Fever Tree Tonic Water is Superb
review/text: Yes, Fever Tree Tonic Water is as advertised ... or better - this is the best tonic I've tasted as a G&T mixer as tested for multiple gin products.  In my opinion it's much better than Q and national (US) brands.  Delivery from Amazon suppliers took a little more time than expected, but the wait was worth it.  I'll definitely order again, and will probably try other Fever Tree products.

review/text: The Fever Tree Premium Indian Tonic Water is all you would want from a tonic for those summer time favorites -- Gin and Tonic.  My daughter (graduate of the Culinary Institute of America) introduced me to this Tonic Water last Christmas as a special present.  Until I tried Fever Tree, I always insisted on Schweppes for my G&Ts.  Now I'm hooked, and I routinely order cases from Amazon, as the tonic is not available locally.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a gin-and-tonic cocktail.

review/summary: I agree one of the best tonic waters out there
review/text: I too was looking to enhance my Gin and Tonic experience.  I have become a G&T snob,  I cannot/will not drink any of that swill the comes out of the nozzle at the bar (actually I won't touch the US basics CD or scheppes either).  As a result I usually have a nice beer when out and enjoy my G&T at home or when U\I take my show on the road I have to take all the fixins with (FT, Gin, Lime Press, cutting board knife etc...).<br /><br />  The Fever Tree Tonic is so light and refreshing with a nice light carbonation.  Mixed with a nice gin (I like the Sapphire, and have been known to try the Rangpur) and a sqeeze of lime cannot be beat.  Mixed on the right glass, I like the Italian pressed glass it's durable and has a nice feel.  When I find a glass I like I stock up and have for my enjoyment or entertaining.<br /><br />  For those of you that like a little more lime in your drink try the Chef'n citrus press,  it performs way above any other presses,  but you muct still put in a slice so you get the benefit of the peel.

review/text: My husband and I just completed a hike of the West Highland Way in Scotland, where the prospect of a cozy pub at the end of a wet day's walking was really motiviting. Then I ordered my first gin & tonic in the UK and became obsessed with Indian water...it really transforms the drink into something amazing. Most pubs were using BritVic tonic water in the little single-serving bottles, but I discovered on our return to the States that BritVic is completely unavailable in the US or Canada. Fever Tree was recommended as a viable alternative and I've been very pleased with the results. Totally worth it.

review/text: I don't know what has happened to formulation or processing of the "big name" Earl Grey teas in the past several years, but the quality of those had degraded to such an extent that I went looking for a replacement. I am happy to say that I have found it in spades in this brand!  The bergamot comes through not only in the aroma but also the taste. (I also really like the color of the box!) This company also makes a "double bergamot" Earl Grey but I actually prefer the regular (this one) to the double. If you have become unhappy with your current Earl Grey, I recommend that you give this one a try.

review/summary: Perhaps Brewing Wrong?
review/text: I find that most (not all) people in North America brew their tea for too long a period.  When I first visited China I was amazed at how quickly after pouring the boiling water into the pot, they poured out the "finished" tea.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Keurig machine and have it perfect for making this tea.  I only drink it iced, perhaps that is the difference?  Two bags in the permanent filters and run through twice (using the large cup setting).  Poured over ice with a bit of milk.  I use Stevia for my sweetener.<br /><br />No bitterness.  Just perfectly brewed aromatic Chai Tea.  With the double spice, it gives my tastebuds the perfect "kick" that I desire.

review/text: This chai has good flavor but needs more black tea leaves to make a fully satisfying cup of tea. It leans on cloves but not overly, to my taste. The Tazo chai has more tea leaves and tastes very good if used properly -- 2 mugs of tea or an extra large mug from each tea bag. I've gotten used to the Stash spicing now (have enjoyed 6 boxes) and like to drink both the Stash and the Tazo (also finished 6 boxes), which I drink straight, in succession, in the morning. Then I switch to decaf Tazo chai which is very good and makes 2 mugs per tea bag.

review/summary: Stash tea can vary batch to batch
review/text: I have, in the past, positively reviewed other Stash flavors, Ginger Lemon and Holiday Chai.  Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once, but then a second shipment was excellent.  But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices.

review/text: this is my drink of choice.  I'm addicted.  I drink 3-4 cups a day simply because nothing else tastes this good.  I've tried other chai-spice teas; none of them compare.  The downside to telling everyone to buy this tea is the prospect that you might actually do it, raising the prices.  You should try it, it's good.

review/summary: Best of the Earl Grey teas
review/text: A classic tea, great by itself or with a large chocolate brownie drenched in dark chocolate syrup. Earl Grey seems to be a difficult tea to blend properly: without the proper proportion and quality of bergamot, the tea is either astringent or overly flowery. In my opinion, Stash gets the blend just right with their standard Earl Grey (the decaf version is also terrific, but to my taste the double bergamot drowns the tea flavor). I've tried several other brands, and can hardly drink the others. Don't say you dislike Earl Grey before trying this blend!

review/text: This is some awesome tea and I fear complete addiction is coming my way.  I just tried it for the first time today and am here on amazon ordering some, so I might keep plenty on hand for my Chai drinking needs.  This is a very smooth tea and will never produce a bitter taste.  It is like liquid pumpkin pie with real whipped cream.  A major part to my mouth and serenity to my senses.  I HIGHLY recommend.

review/summary: Stash Brand Earl Grey Tea
review/text: To my taste, the Stash brand of Earl Grey Black Tea (in tea bags) is the best I have found. After trying Twinings, Bigelow and a few others, I discovered Stash and found it to have a fresher, cleaner taste with a more pronounced bergamot fragrance. It costs slightly more than the others but seems well worth it to me. Also, buying it in quantity through Amazon brings the cost down significantly as compared to local grocery chains.

review/summary: stash peach
review/text: I fell in love with Stash Peach Tea in about 2005 when I had it at the Hobnob Tea Room in Loveland CO. Not only can you select it for your lunch but you can buy a box from the stock they keep on hand. Because it's a family owned restaurant (not a chain) naturally they have to charge enough to pay for s/h. I found it a little cheaper at Vitamin Cottage. I always had a big cup after lunch at my desk at the post office where I worked in the passport office. Every time customers or other clerks would come in they would say "wow what smells so delicious?". It began to happen that I would make a trip to Hobnob or Vit Cott and they would be out of my tea. That flavor does not seem to be carried even in stores that carry Stash. So I found it by accident on Amazon while looking for something else entirely. I was so happy. If I purchase enough at a time it saves me nearly a dollar a box over all. I drink it every day so VOILA I found a great deal on Amazon. Thank you!!!

review/text: ...Stash Chai and Amazon's auto delivery service! Unlike many chai teas, Stash does not use black pepper. You get the good spices without the funny bite. Our office is addicted to this -- no morning goes by without a cup of chai! So the Amazon deal of free shipping every three months works perfectly for us. No more running to the grocery store -- or doing without because we forgot!

review/summary: Earl Grey of Earl Grey +++
review/text: I already liked regular Stash Earl Grey and so dared to try this doubled bergamot variant. This Earl Grey variant is the best I have tried out of many. There may be ones stronger in both aspects of the black tea and bergamot or more balanced -- but I only know that this "Double Bergamot Earl Grey" is a very balanced rich black tea with bergamot -- and it is organic like other Stash teas. This doubled bergamot Earl Grey is great hot with milk and brown sugar -- or icy with just a tad lemon or lime to add to the bergamot -- or without such additions. Also it is so rich someone can add it to other plain, even modest, black tea [bags one-for-one] for a more mellow bergamot tea. I even found it interesting with black mint tea [bags one-for-one] as this variant is not overwhelmed by other teas +++

review/summary: A Favorite Morning Beverage
review/text: I was introduced to Stash a few years ago when I sampled their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG89Y">peppermint tea</a>, which was so powerful you could smell it through the packaging. It was so delicious I decided to get a box of each of their tea samplers, including black.<br /><br />Now I have another Stash favorite. After running out while on vacation I had to try a number of different Earl Grey teas (Bigelow, Twinings, Generic Grocery Store brand), and though adequate, they lacked the extra bergamot kick I'd grown to love. With Stash you get a fragrant, excellent quality tea, and they know how to package it for freshness.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite morning hot drinks when I want to start my day with a nice jolt. And if you have a sweet tooth like me, serve hot with sweetened condensed milk.

review/text: But thankfully, Amazon is there to be my supplier!<br /><br />This is strong tea, but I love it.  I can't tolerate so much as the scent of coffee, and I never was a morning Mountain Dew person, but this gets me moving in the AM.  I've cut back in that I don't brew two bags in a mug for 20 minutes at a time like I did a decade ago with Earl Grey.<br /><br />Super Target used to carry it around here, D/FW, but I think I may have singlehandedly cleaned them out over the course of the past year.<br /><br />The great thing about Amazon is, not only can I buy six+ months worth at once but there is no tax & free shipping.  Between those extras and not having to go anywhere to purchase it, it costs well below what it does at the store.

review/summary: Tasty Tea
review/text: I used to spend a fortune on good Chai Tea at the coffee shop.  Then, I discovered the double-spice tea.  We both loved the stronger flavor of the spices.  To my dismay, on my next trip to the grocery store, the double-spice tea was nowhere to be found!  It was one of those items that apparently wasn't on their regular ordering schedule.  I looked it up on Amazon, and, there it was...six boxes at a time, on subscribe and save, a decent price, and quick delivery!  This tea is great with a "sweetener of choice" (I generally use stevia or agave in mine) and some milk or cream, hot or cold.  My hubbie drinks it with no additions at all and it is his "pre-sleep" tea of choice.  I've also used 5-7 bags in my iced tea maker and the result is yummy iced tea (or, add just a bag of this tea to regular tea for a hint of spice).  Stash teas are great overall.  I like the fact that they are individually wrapped in a "foil" wrap that holds together well and can be taken to the office or wherever without dissolving in one's pocket or purse!  It IS black tea and contains caffeine!  If this is a problem, try the Good Earth Original Caffeine-Free tea.  Also available on Amazaon, it is a delicious, slightly sweet, cinnamon-y tea!

I primarily drink Earl Gray teas because they are a deep rich teas, but not overpowering.  When you drink Earl Gray, you feel like you drank a fine cup of English tea.  The Double Bergamot added to the Earl Gray is even more superior!  Bergamot is also relaxing.  This is a wonderful blend and very difficult to find in stores.

review/text: What can get me out of a cat-warmed bed on a chilly morning?  A pot of Stash Double Spice Chai tea.  The spices are enticing and warm up you up down to your toes.  I find the best way to drink it is with a splash of vanilla soy milk in the bottom of the mug, then pour in the tea.  The vanilla soy adds just enough sweetness to counteract the bitterness of the tea (I like to brew it strong), but not so sweet that it overpowers the spices.  Yum!

review/summary: Tea Devotee from Way Back
review/text: I've never been a coffee drinker.  I've only drunk tea since I was a child.  I've always brewed my tea as strongly as I could then added half & half.  I first saw this Irish tea fairly recently and bought a box.  It is the most delicious tea I've ever drunk.  I drink it very strong with half & half and love it.  However, unlike the Irish, I can only drink it in the morning.  I heartily recommend this full-bodied, wonderfully flavored tea.  It's everything a good breakfast tea should be.
