review/summary: Seriously good
review/text: This stuff is the best store-bought gluten free bread I've ever tasted. Granted I haven't tried all the different kinds, but enough to know that Udi's makes FANTASTIC gf bread. It's light, crusty, and tastes like bread. It toasts up beautifully. I can't get enough.

review/summary: Don't waste your money on this bread!!!
review/text: I tried this bread - TWICE! - because the first loaf I bought seemed stale and tasteless.  Thinking that maybe I had bought a "bad" loaf or something, threw it away and bought another.  SAME THING!!  It was horrible!  This time, I took the bread back to the store and asked for my money back.  The salesgirl said that a lot of people don't like this, but there's not much else to choose from when it comes to buying gluten-free bread that does taste good.  Great, huh?

review/summary: Intense Ginger Experience and Digestive Aid
review/text: *****<br /><br />This Organic Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is ideal as a digestive aid, and it also purportedly enhances circulation. It's a lovely, intense, all natural herbal tea made from organic ginger root, organic lemon grass, orgnaic licorice root, organic peppermint leaf, and organic black pepper. The taste is exactly like ginger, spicy and peppery, with sweet overtones. It's very nice anytime, but especially after a meal.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Ginger Organic Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Our 100% Organic Ginger tea has something to offer to anyone who wants to get or stay healthy. For millennia, herbalists from all over the world have known of the healing, soothing and energizing qualities of this root, considered the "universal medicine."  Organic Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used worldwide as a safe and mild home remedy for a variety of conditions, including motion sickness, occasional upset stomach and intestinal gas, as well as minor menstrual cramps. Ayurvedic practitioners have used Ginger for years as a way of activating the body's fire element (Agni), which burns up Ama (the body's toxins, comprised of both undigested food and naturally occurring toxins). When Ama is decreased, the body gains strength, balance and harmony. As a natural warming energizer, Ginger is also known to support the immune system, promote rapid and complete digestion and increase intestinal tone and peristalsis.  Furthermore, it works as an antioxidant and has been shown to safely and effectively relieve nausea associated with motion. Our 100% Organic Ginger tea tastes delicious and provides the highest quality of a timeless remedy."<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Good, warming tea
review/text: This is a good tea to drink in the winter because it is quite warming.  The ginger, licorice root, black pepper, are all very good at warming the body through.  It took me a while to get used to having pepper in my tea, but now that I have I like the little kick of spice it adds.  I don't even add honey anymore.  Some might consider this to be a very "biting" tea.  This is why I say it is good for winter.  I've bought it during the summer and feel it would be more satisfying in cooler weather.  I have to say that I won't buy again because of the pepper, but this reflects a personal preference, not impression of quality.<br /><br />Yogi Tea uses organic ingredients and 100% recycled cardboard for their attractive packaging.  They are a company based out of Oregon.<br /><br />I couldn't say how well it helps with digestion, as I don't drink it on a regular basis.  But we all know that ginger is very good for the body.

review/text: I made this into cupcakes to take with us to a family dinner.  My son is allergic to peanuts and the dessert being served was not safe for him to eat.  I made the chocolate cake into cup cakes, it made 12 VERY high cupcakes.  Next time, I will make about 15 smaller rise cupcakes.  I used the vanilla icing mix that Cherrybrook makes as well.  They were fabulous!  I love knowing these are allergen free.  I will be recommending these mixes to my sister in law who is allergic to eggs and any other folks I meet that mention allergies!  SUPER deal buying from Amazon.  Just need room to store all this mix until you need it!  I froze 6 of my cupcakes for future visits to familiy functions.

review/summary: Lifesaver For My Dairy, Nut and Egg Allergic Child and Delicious!
review/text: What can I say except that this cake mix is delicious and a lifesaver. My son is allergic to dairy, nut and egg so he cannot eat the typical cake and has to sit out at cake time at birthday parties. I searched for a substitute for him and for his own parties and came up with some good concoctions but nothing really tasted "normal" enough for all the kids to enjoy.  This, however, is outrageously delicious and makes great cake and cupcakes and I haven't had a single kid notice the difference. I do notice the difference, however, between this and a store made cake and this beats any typical store cake. It uses belgian chocolate, which I think compensates for the lack of egg or dairy. It comes out dense and rich, almost a hybrid of a cake and brownie and we love it and use it for all special occasions. Also, a few tips... I like lowfat stuff and I have started substituting applesauce for the bulk of the oil. I cook it a little longer to firm it up but it comes out awesome. Also, the odd thing is that a number of Pillsbury frostings do not have egg or dairy in them.  Although full of chemicals and a contradiction to the pureness of this mix, I have used them and I think it gives the cupcakes/cake a familiar taste to other kids so that they have no hint that this is a vegan mix.  I, on the other hand, love it without any frosting, still warm, served with either soy ice cream or some lowfat frozen yogurt. Its just great and as I say it has been a lifesaver in that it has brought normalcy to special events that had previously been very challenging in terms of figuring out what to serve that my son could eat.  We've gotten many compliments on this case.

review/summary: A Really Great Cake Mix For Vegans!
review/text: I'm a professionally trained pastry chef, and I have to say I was blown away at the high quality of the product. I'm usually averse to using mixes, but the Cherrybrook Kitchen products do a great job at balancing exceptional flavor with non-dairy ingredients.<br /><br />I've baked out the chocolate cake, yellow cake and brownie mixes several times and they always come out as expected. The frosting mixes are also exceptional and offer room for modulating the ingredients if you prefer to use butter/margarine blends for richness - not vegan, I know, but the flavor isn't lost either way.<br /><br />The sugar content is low, which helps to keep the calorie count down on these cakes - for those dieting, or watching their sugar intake. Overall, I highly recommend these cake and frosting mixes.<br /><br />A note about baking:  home ovens vary in temperature for a variety of reasons. If you suspect that your oven temps are not what they should be, invest in an oven thermometer to make sure you are heating to the proper temps. These mixes absolutely perform as the written instructions provide, but you need to make sure you preheat and reach the correct temperatures, and then maintain them by not opening the oven door constantly.

review/text: No worries about having to order ANY of these mixes in bulk lots of 6!  They are great to have in stock and you will want to share them with friends.<br /><br />I do not have any food allergies, yet I have loved this chocolate cake since a friend made one for me years ago.  You might not even need to frost this cake!  I have always served it right from the pan, so I cannot attest to the difficulty or ease of turning the single layer cake out onto a platter.  Leaving it in the pan may also help it set up correctly in the center; I use a 9 inch (not 8) metal (not glass) round pan and am able to follow the suggested cooking times in my electric oven.<br /><br />Added bonus: the graphics on the box are so great I can store these in plain sight on my kitchen hutch!

review/summary: cook time wrong
review/text: The box says to cook this for 25 minutes on 350 in a round metal pan until a toothpick comes out clean.  I have cooked 4 of them now.  The first was ruined because I did 25 min. and the toothpick was only wet looking on the tip, so I assumed I hit a chocolate chip.  But, after it cooled when I tipped over the pan to get the cake out, it fell apart and there was a about a layer in the middle towards the bottom that was not cooked.  The second one I kept checking and the toothpick didn't come out clean until 40 minutes.  The cake didn't taste that great, because most of it was overcooked.  I just cooked 2 more for my nieces birthday tomorrow and it also took 40 minutes for toothpick to come out clean.  I am hoping they taste okay.  At least she likes them, but I do wish that it cooked more evenly so that parts of it weren't either overdone or underdone.

review/text: I believe I prefer this cake mix to the regular ones.  I grew up on home made cakes and am not crazy about cake mixes, but I'm lazy.  I tried this one because its peanut free and we have an allergy in the household.  Much to my surprise I really liked the cake.  It's moist.  I doesn't taste fake like most mixes.  Its not overly sweet.  And its wonderful rich chocolate but not overly sweet.  I really appreciated not having to have eggs or milk, since I don't always have those items in the house.<br /><br />The cooking time was a bit of a problem.  I don't remember how much longer it took than the directions, at least 5 minutes, probably longer.  If your toothpick comes out wet, believe it.  It isn't done yet.

I love this cake mix!! It saves me sone time, but none of the crap in the regulas mixes. So, when I do not have time or lack ingredients to make my own, I dress this up with my own style and make it mine! Semi-Homade As Sandra Lee says! My son loves these mixes and perfers them to store bought, which I do not like to do!! Also, buy it in bulk here, cuz in the store one box can cost you up to 5.99!! The Frosting Mix is really good as well! I have made it as a royal icing and used organic non-salted butter for the more fluffy frosting! DO NOT BUY THE PRE-MADE FROSTING UNTIL THEY GET THE RECIPE RIGHT!!! YUCK!!

review/summary: Good, as long as you get what you order!
review/text: I would never order this from Amazon again, although I will buy this cake mix again.  The mix itself was great.  HOWEVER...<br /><br />I ordered this for my daughter's birthday party with her grandparents.  When we arrived and I opened the package, I realized that instead of the package of six, we had ONE. (We had ordered some other mixes, so it wasn't obvious until I opened the box.)  Twenty minutes on the phone with someone who spoke decent English with a slight Indian accent was supposed to get us a new box of six cake mixes.  The cake mixes arrived two days later than expected, toward the end of our trip.  (Could have been T.S. Faye woes?) The even bigger problem?  We received the gluten free mix, which is okay I guess (doesn't taste as good) but not at all what I ordered.  I didn't really want to mess with it after that.  I bought these to save a little money over the huge price in our grocery store, but I spent WAY more, when you consider that I only received one box of the product I ordered.<br /><br />P.S. - the cake mix itself is excellent.

review/summary: Long-lasting flavor in a xylitol gum
review/text: I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Cinnamon is by far my favorite. The flavor lasts for longer than any of the other Spry flavors. The warming effect of cinnamon oil also offsets the cooling effect of xylitol, making it not feel as strange in the mouth.<br /><br />I really like that the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. It's great that I can chew this without having intestinal problems.

review/summary: Yummy way to save your teeth
review/text: Let's face it.  No one wants to get bad news from the dentist.  Proper dental care can go a long way to keeping one's teeth for a lifetime.<br /><br />The generation that grew up in the Depression and World War II many times did not have good dental care.  No fluoride, sealants, waterpiks, sonic toothbrushes and the like.  It wasn't uncommon for a person in their 30s to be missing a few teeth.  People generally could look forward to wearing dentures as their teeth became so rotten, the only thing to do was to pull them.<br /><br />Today, we don't have such problems.  And one of the reasons is the use of xylitol to help kill the bacteria that cause tooth decay.  The main reason for dental decay is a bacterium called S. Mutans.  This bug feeds on sugars and starches, secreting acids which destroy tooth enamel, which leads to decay and cavities.  There are various ways to defeat this bug, brushing, fluoride, flossing and sealants all have their place.<br /><br />A more modern addition to the decay-preventing fight is xylitol.  It's a sugar alcohol that S. Mutans cannot digest.  Sucking on mints or chewing gum with xylitol a few times a day is a easy and tasty way to curb this nasty bacteria.<br /><br />I've been chewing xylitol gum and eating xylitol mints for a number of years, and I've noticed that my dental problems have really improved.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  My only complaint is that this gum is so delicious, I tend not to ration it to make it last longer.  Try Spry.  Your mouth will thank you for it.  (Maybe not your dentist, though).

review/summary: Everything from China
review/text: Personally, I have read too much and heard too many news reports about the lack of valid oversight in China when it comes to the health and safety of their products and ingredients (from medicines to food to children's toys...) for me to be comfortable with their products. This is a personal decision because for me, health is paramount in life.<br /><br />Here is part of an email I received from Xlear about their products in answer to my questions about the origin of their products:<br /><br />"Good Afternoon,<br /><br />The raw Xylitol comes from China, shipped to Orem, UT and that is where we make the Xlear Nasal Spray.  Our Gum, Mints and Candies are all made in China. The rest of our products are made here in the states.  I hope that was the information you were looking for. Have a nice day!<br /><br />Xlear Inc."<br /><br />I find this especially troubling because the nasal spray has a big red, white and blue shield that says "Made in the USA." So all the ingredients come from China and are put together in Utah. Can this really be legal? To say "Made in the USA" when all the ingredients are from China?<br /><br />If it is 'legal' to say this (yes, we have big problems with our own FDA)...it is still unethical in my opinion. Deceptive, misleading. Sigh...American business and politics. Maybe we should all just move to China. And get jobs in their factories.

I put this in my kids' lunch, because they have had some issues with cavities, and despite my begging that they brush at lunch, I am very sure they are not.  I take this gum also, and I chew it after my lunch.  I know my kids will chew this, even if the flavor doesn't last long, because it's gum- and all gum is better than no gum.  On the negatives side, if you are looking for a gum that stays soft and chewy and flavorful for a long time, this isn't it.  I like the flavor- it's not bitter like some cinnamon gums, but I can't say it lasts long.  I chew it, feel it freshens my breath and may help my teeth, and the pretty quickly, when it starts to taste like unflavored rubber, I spit it out.<br /><br />what follows is from wiki:<br /><br />Xylitol is a "toothfriendly" sugar. In addition to not encouraging tooth decay (by replacing dietary sugars), xylitol may actively aid in repairing minor cavities caused by dental caries.[citation needed] Early studies from Finland in the 1970s found that a group chewing sucrose gum had 2.92 decayed, missing, or filled (dmf) teeth compared to 1.04 in the group chewing xylitol gums. In another study, researchers had mothers chew xylitol gum 3 months after delivery until their children were 2 years old. The researchers found that the xylitol group had "a 70% reduction in caries (dmf)." Recent research confirms a plaque-reducing effect and suggests that the compound, having some chemical properties similar to sucrose, attracts and then "starves" harmful micro-organisms, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption. (However, this same effect also interferes with yeast micro-organisms and others, so xylitol is inappropriate for making yeast-based bread, for instance.)<br /><br />Xylitol based products are allowed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make the medical claim that they do not promote dental caries.[9]

review/summary: Chew it for health only.
review/text: Xylitol is supposedly good for your teeth, and that's why I bought this product. Is it actually good for the teeth? I don't know, but it's nice to know I'm actively trying to improve my health.<br /><br />The flavor of this gum is quite good, sweet and cinnamony with a little kick, but it lasts for all of 3 minutes. I don't even know why it says chew for at least 5 minutes on the jar if the flavor lasts for less than that.

I have dry mouth very bad and sometimes I have trouble swallowing because of the dryness. This gum has been very helpful with adding moisture and increasing my comfort level. I really like the flavor of the cinnamon gum even though it doesn't last as long as I would like but that's minor in my case.

review/summary: Great taste.... for about 5 seconds
review/text: I had to post a review of this because the Spry gum is so ridiculous. I thought I was getting a great deal, but I suppose you get what you pay for. I eat two of these every time and the flavor is gone literally within about one minute (that is probably even a bit generous). I would not recommend this gum to anyone. The cinnamon flavor is amazing initially, but, as I said, the flavor lasts so briefly it is not worth it at all. If you are just getting this because you want to chew on something, go ahead and buy this, but don't expect flavor.

I will never order again, no matter the price. My order was a complete waste of money.

review/text: I decided to give Spry Cinnamon a chance, reading mostly positives reviews about it. When I first popped a piece in, it tasted great! However, and I am not exaggerating, the flavor was gone in 10 seconds . . . I have never had a gum that the flavor went out so fast in. And like others have said, the gum does turn a little hard and nasty within a minute. I like the idea of it being all natural and helping your teeth, but it's not worth it to me.

I also bought the 600ct fruit flavor of this same brand and that was better, the flavor lasted longer and the gum stayed soft for a reasonable length of time.

review/summary: Good Stuff! Make Sure You Keep Away From Dogs!
review/text: This has amazing taste! Even though there have been double blind studies showing it reduces cavities xylitol is controversial. I chew it because I have low saliva production. Ten minutes every hour, ten hours a day increases saliva production, which protects gums and teeth. It is thought that mouth bacteria can't ferment it, which is the reason it reduces cavities.<br /><br />Xylitol to dogs is deadly, so I am very careful to keep Xlear Spry gum where they can NEVER get to it, and disposing the used gum into the trash out in the garage. In dogs, Xylitol is toxic. Just 3 grams can kill a 65 pound dog. In about 30 minutes (give or take) of a dog eating something containing xylitol, their blood sugar begins droping to dangerous levels. Symptoms are weakness, lethargy, loss of coordination, collapse and seizures. An IMMEDIATE trip to the vet is needed, otherwise there is little chance your dog will survive. This doesn't affect cats.<br /><br />Another thing to consider with xylitol, is that it does thin the blood in humans. People on blood thinners, such as myself should consult their doctors before consuming Xlear Spry or any xylitol containing items.<br /><br />That said, Xlear Spry gum is really good, I especially like the cinnamon flavor. I love the flavor! Also, there are no Phenylketonurics (known cancer causing ingredients) in Spry.

review/text: I love cinnamon gum.  It is like dessert to me.  I was excited to try some gum made with real cinnamon oil.  My other "go to" brand has every type of "tol"(manitol, sorbitol etc.) sweetener made and that scares me just a little.  This has a nice peppery, cinnamon flavor to start but only lasts a few minutes.  Maybe this is the true cost of a natural flavoring?  My "go to" brand lasts and lasts but is probably killing me on the inside.  The quest for a true cinnamon gum continues.

It does lose it's flavor, but not much more quickly than some other gums.  I usually chew two peices at a time as they are a bit small. The Spry mints are also good.

review/summary: nice but could be improved
review/text: Being a guy that chews gum everyday i was looking for a healthier alternative to my usual ''dentyne ice'' those small rectangular hard pieces of gum.  I found spry and thought i hit the jackpot.  When you open the container , first thing you will notice are the gum pieces are much smaller than dentyne ice , then when you first try it the flavor is very nice like a milder version of ''big red'', but thats where it stops, the flavor is sucked out of it in about 20 seconds and you will need to pop about 3 of these just to feel like you are chewing on something.  My suggestion is make them about 1/3 bigger and do something to make the flavor last a bit longer.  They're supposedly good for your teeth so ill use up my order and possibly order them again if i dont find a better version of this gum.

The sugar substitutes that end in "ol" (like "Xylitol") are sugar alcohols and these can pull liquid into the bowel and cause diarrhea and other digestive upsets.

review/text: I am trying to avoid aspartame in my diet, but most sugar-free gum contains it. This gum uses only Xylitol as the sweetener.  It is very strong at first (I purchased cinnamon flavor), but the flavor subsides quickly.  If you keep it in your mouth though, you begin to taste it again.  Maybe the initial strength deadens the taste buds temporarily. One upside is that it isn't nearly as sticky or soft as other gums, so it doesn't make a mess trying to throw it away.  Make sure you keep it away from pets, because Xylitol is toxic for dogs.

review/summary: Healthy Chewing Gum with Good Flavor
review/text: Since I was a kid, I have loved chewing sugarless gum. I have read that it is a good habit, as it helps clean your teeth after meals and prevent cavities, and may even help prevent acid reflux. Chewing cinnamon gum has even been shown to boost mental performance in a study. However, I became concerned about the possible heath risks from artificial sweeteners like potassium acesulfame used in the gum available at local stores, so I was chewing less often. I decided to try this Xlear Spry cinnamon gum, sweetened with Xylitol. According to Wikipedeia, xylitol has a lot of heath benefits, including reducing dental caries, ear and upper respiratory infections, and Candida yeast growth; it also helps remineralize teeth and bones.  I am happy with Spry cinnamon gum as a substitute for the name-brand gums I had bought previously, though it isn't perfect.  I do have to chew two pieces, as the gum seems to shrink over time, and the flavor is pleasant but doesn't seem to be quite as strong or last as long.  Also the cost of Spry is higher, since I can't take advantage of sales and coupons like with other gum.  These are minor complaints, though, and I am happily switching my family to healthier xylitol-based gum.

review/text: There is such a great cinnamon flavor to this gum!  The cinnamon oils lend a strong and natural tasting flavor.  It is made with no sugar substitutes which is why I bought it and the Xylitol ingredient is good for your teeth.  I was very satisfied with the length of the flavor as well as the texture of the gum even after a long chew.

review/summary: not a good chew
review/text: Like other xylitol gum I've tried the flavor was good but the gum was hard and within minutes it was grainy and unpleasant to chew, unlike Trident gum, which is sweetened, at least partly, with xylitol, is good chewing gum and that's the whole point!

review/text: I use this gum because it is good for the health of your teeth, does not effect blood sugar, love cinnamon taste, fruit flavor also good.  I chew a couple of pieces after every meal and sometimes in the evening.  Chew about 15 minutes, I do longer.  A friend told me the other day that my face was looking slimmer, I have not lost weight or exercised it - except for chewing!  Could be true!

review/text: Let me just say that I normally don't review things that I buy from amazon, but I felt that it had to be known that this gum is less than spectacular. I chew about a  12-14 count pack of gum a day, but the flavor runs out on this in a mere minutes. I find myself eating 20-40 pieces. If you want xylitol gum, I think you should look for other brands, namely Trident.

I just don't chew gum anymore since it is so hard to find just old fashioned regular gum with sugar and no additives.  Aspartame;bad, Xylitol;worse. They all change motablism.  No wonder obesity is so prevalent now. I would like just regular sugar based gum.

review/summary: Great value, good pantry staple
review/text: I really like this product. I find they soften in as little as 10 minutes or so. I simply sort through them and pull out the kind of mushrooms that I'm after (either porcini or chanterelles, for instance). The best part of using dried mushrooms is using the flavored water that the mushrooms steep in, such as pasta sauces, risotto, etc. I never throw it away.<br /><br />As to other people's comments about dirt or rocks, this is my second jar and I have never encountered that. Like dried beans, you should visually inspect the dried mushrooms before you add them to recipes; sometimes the steps do not revive well and stay tough. In general, reconstituted dried mushrooms do have a chewier texture. I encountered this when drying my own mushrooms. Some of this is just the process, not this particular product. I went to Italy last year and bought several packages of dried porcini and some of them were a bit chewy, too.<br /><br />You do get better and fresher dried mushrooms if you buy them in small quantities, but they are much, much more expensive. I use for Italian mushrooms for special occasions, and use these for my everyday cooking.

review/summary: Tasteless- a big jar of disappointment
review/text: I love dried mushrooms.  All kinds of them.  But I was very disappointed in these and am trying to decide what to do with this huge container now.  They have no flavor at all.  Reconstituting is a challenge, because  the different types of mushrooms require different amounts of time to hydrate.  But I worked with them, removing the different types from the liquid as they were ready.  The problem is that they have no taste at all to them. None. Neither does the broth.  I have purchased other types of Roland dried mushrooms and been very happy with them.  These are a big disappointment.

review/summary: Questionable quality and from FRANCE!!!
review/text: If I'd known these were from France, I never would have ordered them. The mushrooms I received look nothing like the ones in the image on Amazon. In the image, there are a lot of golden/light brown mushrooms, all I got were very dark brown to black. The aroma and flavor seem fine, but the color indicates either they were dried at too high of a temperature, or they are very old. And there are a lot of woody stems. Either way, the flavor and nutritional value would not be what it should be. I had subscribed for regular deliveries of these, however, after getting my first jar, I'm cancelling and going to buy in bulk and mix my own in the future.

review/text: I use dried mushrooms frequently in making soup and thought I'd give these a try.  I would say that they are not as intense in flavor as others I've used.  In addition, one of the mushrooms in the mix is a sort of flat, slippery and crunchy variety - not a good mix with the others, which are more soft and meaty in terms of texture - and I usually leave them out of whatever I'm cooking.  Possibly they'd be good in an omelette but I haven't been that adventurous.

Fyi - at least for the ones shipped to me it's "Product of France". Price looks good too. Typical pricing in local Chicago grocery stores tends to be $4 an ounce & up.<br /><br />Fyi II - it's white text on a light blue background but if you look carefully on the jar image at amazon.com - you can discern "France" on there. Roland reserves the right to change that?

review/summary: EXTRA GOOD! This creamy chicken "Soup at Hand" is fab!
review/text: Campbells Creamy Chicken Soup at Hand is especially tasty when you need it: if you have no appetite, are getting a cold, or feel the flu coming on! These soup at hand ready to serve soups are extreme comfort when you, or someone you love, is just not at the top of their game! When I just can't face a meal, this creamy chicken soup is perfect for making me feel better - plus it gives a sick person something tasty to wash down all those meds, syrups, and other yucky stuff. And hot soup is so soothing when fighting a cold, flu, or just the "under the weather" feeling. This creamy chicken flavor is extra tasty for the amount of calories, too!

review/text: This is strictly a product of convenience, for it tastes about as you might expect (or perhaps worse) of something in styrofoam from a microwave.  I wasn't expecting a gourmet experience, but on the other hand I wasn't expecting chicken soup that tastes like some high school chemistry experiment gone horribly wrong.  A much better solution would be to buy yourself a ream of styrofoam cups and a dozen cans of Campbell's cream of chicken soup.  If you can afford the 30 seconds with a can opener and a spoon, you'll be rewarded with something that provides a reasonable facsimile of the taste of real soup.

review/text: I love this soup. I only tried it recently and went back to my local store to buy more. I have found locally that different stores carry different varieties of the Campbell's Soup At Hand and the Creamy Chicken is not carried at all my local stores, so I was very glad to find it at Amazon. Although it does not contain much actual chicken, this soup has a wonderful chicken flavor. It is so creamy and good and tastes like real comfort food. It is great for a quick lunch or dinner, either alone or combined with a salad or sandwich. I almost wish Campbell's made it available in larger cans, but that's true of all the Soup At Hand flavors.<br /><br />I hope that Amazon will continue to carry these soups, as the price is much better per container (about $1.30 each) than the individual prices at some of the larger grocers.

review/text: I am a fan of Caffe D'Vita instant cappucino mix.  I have tried the caramel and pumpkin spice and I loved them both.  The irish cream flavor is not really to my liking because it's a little too dark and not what I expected.  I was thinking it would be a little bit sweeter, similar to International Delight (or similar) non dairy creamers.  It's nothing like that at all.  I either make it weak or doctor it up and still it's only just ok.  Likely I could buy the creamer mentioned and take the edge off this flavor.  I will continue to order this brand but not this flavor.

review/text: I happen to be drinking an Orange Zevia as I write this review.  :)<br /><br />I cannot compliment this brand enough.  I've been purchasing all flavors of Zevia for the past few years and absolutely love it.  There isn't an aftertaste at all, and it is simply delicious.  Zevia's Natural Orange is among my favorite flavors.  My other Zevia favorites are black cherry and root beer, however all their flavors are yummy!<br /><br />My favorite things about Zevia are that they are sweetened with all-natural stevia and do not contain any harmful chemicals.  Also, I love the fact that there are not any calories in it.  There are no artificial colors or flavors either.<br /><br />The only Zevia flavor I've seen caffeine in is cola.  All the others are caffeine-free.<br /><br />I deducted a star from this product due to the pricey price point of Zevia. I still continue to buy it, but not as often as I would like to due to the cost.<br /><br />I have emailed the Zevia corporate team and they are responsive, professional, and friendly. I trust this brand.<br /><br />I hope you give Zevia a try. I think you will be pleased!

It tastes MUCH better when you aren't ingesting either sugar or sugar substitutes.<br /><br />Best thing - EVERYTHING IN THIS IS ALL NATURAL!! Enjoy:)

review/summary: Love this beverage...but don't have it shipped to you.
review/text: My family loves this soda.  We sometimes buy it from a nearby grocery store.  HOWEVER,  I had it shipped from Amazon and it is no good.  I believe that somewhere in the process of getting to my home the Zevia Orange may be getting too hot.  It was very hot weather the first time it was shipped to me.  It really tastes weird...not like when we buy if off the shelf.  I tried again in cold weather this time and though it's not as bad, it is still no good. It has an odd bite to it that I assume comes from it getting too warm.  It alters the beverage and cooling it in the frig does not reverse it.

review/summary: If Stevia is bitter for you, then this is the better tasting Zevia drinks
review/text: Because of my genetics Stevia will always be bitter to me. I've tried other artificial sweeteners and stevia is by far the worse in bitterness no matter what brand I try.  I get no sweet taste at all. However, I have to limit my sugar intake, and sometimes I just get tired of other drinks, especially the carbonated ones. I like the orange Zevia because with the bitter Stevia taste it reminds me a lot of the "bitter orange" or lightly sweetened orange sodas that I got in Europe. I haven't tried the lemon or lime flavors, but I imagine the citrus lends itself well to the bitter flavor.

review/summary: I don't drink Orange Soda but I do Now!
review/text: So I had to try this flavor as I like the other two ZEVIA Natural Cola - With Stevia (Case of 24) and ZEVIA Natural Twist - With Stevia (Case of 24).<br /><br />I haven't drank Orange Soda since I was a kid and for some reason I don't remember really liking Orange Crush but Zevia Orange is great and my kids love it as well.

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: Zevia orange really tastes like orange soda - and not like orange DIET soda either. How did they do it? I'm impressed. I wasn't a fan of orange flavored soda until now. This is so great! The cola and lemon-lime are delicious, too. All this and all natural - I'll never drink a diet soda again.

review/summary: A Better Orange!
review/text: I was never an orange soda fan until Zevia.  It is All Natural which is important to me.  There are no artificial sweeteners or ingredients.  The taste is more subtle and refreshing then other orange sodas.  A terrific product that I highly recomend.  Try it!

review/summary: Ugh!
review/text: I took a chance and ordered a case of this, since I like Zevia lemon-lime and think their cola is O.K. as well. Unfortunately, I find it pretty bad: the orange flavor--what little there is of it--is outweighed by a vile, bitter taste that gets worse with every sip. Bleah!!! :(
