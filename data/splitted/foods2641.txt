review/text: This applesauce is excellent.  It's a nice, light snack or a great addition to a meal.  The apple taste is not overpowering.  It's just right.  There is not much difference in the tastes of the original and the cinnamon.  The serving size is perfect.  I'll be ordering more after I gobble up this batch.  Oh, the shipment came with no fatalities.  It's well packaged.

review/text: I rarely review, but I had to extend kudos to Green Mountain for this wonderful hazelnut flavor.  I make mostly iced coffees, and wanted to stop spending so much money at Starbucks.  This coffee is better than Starbucks, Coffee Bean, or any other shop I've tried.  It is light, sweet, and you almost don't need any extra sugar if you add a little milk.  I should note that I like my coffee pretty light.  I also love that this is available in decaf.  I hope they make more decaf flavors available over time.  I adore my Breville single cup coffee maker as well!

review/text: We were given a Keurig coffee machine for a gift. We really like the ease and convenience of use, but the K-cups can be very expensive. I've done extensive comparison shopping, and this particular deal is the best I've found (in online or retail stores, and even different packs here on Amazon). There are not a lot of K-cup decaffeinated choices, but since I like hazelnut flavor, this is a good choice for me.<br /><br />This is a nice mild hazelnut decaf at a good price.

review/summary: Single cup coffee's
review/text: I liked this flavor and the whole single cup system. I am not a avid coffee drinker, but I do like an occasional couple of cups a day. However, I will go several days between drinking any coffee.The single cups last and store longer with no waste.The key to this and all single cup coffee's is the water level. Just a bit more or less water in the coffee blend is critical to the taste.I find that if I fill my coffee cup with too much water, the flavor is watery. I find that the best level is really too small a cup of coffee, however adding the flavored creames allow you to use more water making a larger cup without sacrificing taste.

review/summary: Mild Daily Energy Tonic
review/text: ****<br /><br />This Goji Berry Green Tea from Yogi Tea is a daily energy tonic. It's an all natural tea made from organic green tea leaf, natural and organic flavors, organic green matcha tea leaf, and goji berries (lyceum barbarum). The taste is mild, only very slightly berry-like, tasting mostly of green tea, with a very pleasant aroma; in fact, it's so mild, that I would definitely use two tea bags and brew it for the full six minutes. It does not get bitter. Unless you enjoy very mild tea, you should plan on getting fewer cups of tea from the box. For this reason I gave this tea only four stars.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Goji Berry Green Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Green Tea Goji Berry is an uplifting daily tonic that promotes energy and revitalization with a fragrant blend of Organic Green Tea, Organic Japanese Green Matcha Tea and Goji Berry. For centuries, the peoples of the Far East have treasured Green Tea as a delicious and energizing tonic. A recent study in the American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology (2005) suggests that long-term consumption of Green Tea might provide increased endurance while exercising. Green Tea is also celebrated for its antioxidant properties, which may help promote longevity. This formula also contains Organic Japanese Green Matcha Tea, a powdered form of green tea that provides a burst of energy and delicate flavor. The bright red Goji Berry has been consumed for centuries in the East, and is considered one of the most healing fruits in Traditional Chinese Medicine. This treasured fruit helps convert food into energy, protect the liver from damaging toxins and provides a boost to both the immune and circulation systems. Find yourself on the path to a revitalized life with the invigorating qualities of Green Tea Goji Berry."<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Goji Berry Green Tea contains approximately 52 mg of caffeine per tea bag, which is a bit over half of what is normally found in an 8 oz cup of coffee. It's a pretty strong green tea, with a good portion of the energizing effect coming from caffeine.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting. Recommended.<br /><br />****

review/text: First off I'd like to say, I just tried this tea for the first time, and I loved it. The tea has a subtle flavor, that is hard to describe. It has a pleasant taste that is not to overwhelming, but refreshing. It gives you a boost after drinking it, and leaves you feeling more alert and peaceful. The goji berries have a slightly sweet and bitter flavor, and taste like they were just picked. I have always been impressed with yogi teas. Not only do they  taste good, but they are all very healthy and promote healing. I would also like to add, that the goji berry is one of the most healing fruits in traditional chinese medicine. After I drink up my boxes of tea, I will definitely order more. This tea is 100% percent organic, made from a proprietary blend of green tea, green matcha tea leaf, and goji berries.

review/text: I am not a coffee drinker and have tons of teas!  This is one of my top 3!  I love the taste and unlike another review, I don't steep it 6 minutes at double strength!  I get one large or two small cups from just one tea bag. I steep only 3-4 minutes not longer or it does get a little bitter, at least that's my experience and preference.  However, I do tend to like slightly weaker tea b/c I don't like any hint bitterness.  A few years ago I kept buying different blueberry green teas and kept being disappointed.  I never did find one that tasted much like blueberry or that wasn't slightly bitter like herb teas can be.  So, even though this is Goji berry and not blueberry, I am thrilled to have finally found that aromatic dark berry green tea taste I was looking for!  It's well balanced between a berry and a green tea taste I think and I have already repurchased more!  Most people will not be disappointed in this one, it's an all around excellent well formulated tea!!  LOVE IT!!

review/summary: Very Happy Dog
review/text: And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.

review/summary: very disappointed
review/text: Earl Grey is one of my favorite teas, but I am totally disappointed with this one. It tastes of fake lime to me, like they added some lime jello or something.  FYI the tea pods ( 2.25") are smaller than the coffee pods (2.75"), hence the different T-pod holder, which also has a chamber on the underside, perhaps to channel the tea so it has less contact with surfaces that the coffee may have flavored?<br />Anyway, the only way I could get the t-pod holder for the base model was the senseo website. No local stores had the tea either so I also spent a lot for the case and now I'm saddled with 119 pods I don't want. Too bad I didn't get them from Amazon, who might take them back...<br />I discovered that I can perfectly well make tea in my Senseo by carefully tucking any tea bag in the pod holder, smoothing it and folding back any edges that extend where they might break the seal. It has worked for me in both the single coffee and tea holders.

review/summary: Earl Grey For Senseo
review/text: I got these cause I like making tea in my senseo by putting two bags at a 45 degree angle to each other.  It always turns out great.  One day I got an email from Amazon about these pickwick tea bags.  They only had two varieties, Earl Grey and Peppermint.  I tried the Earl grey because I wasn't sure I wanted 120 bags of peppermint tea.  When I got them, I tried them right away.  The quality was excellent, however, there is a slight mint flavor in the tea, which is not really common to an Earl Grey.  All in all, I like the product, but probably will stick to my $0.99 cent 100 tea bags from Walmart.  But you might enjoy better.  I did NOT purchase the teapod holder for my senseo, I just carefully placed the pods in my small holder instead (FYI).

review/summary: Not bad tea
review/text: I bought this tea as I had one of the Senseo machines.  I was a little disappointed that you need an extra tray for the machine in order to use them.  I think this is a poor design for the machine and is just more clutter in my house.  As for the tea itself, I never really used it in the Senseo machine because it really doesn't work right without the second tray.  I have used it as just a seep in a regular cup of hot water and it is fine.  Some other reviews said this is weak tea and I can see that if it is run through the machine.

I just love them, and was lucky enough to find them on the Amazon site. Not sure why they stopped the production, since the machines are still produced with a tea user. I was very impresses with the company that I purchased it from since there was an issue in the price of shipping, and they responded right away and took care of it. Also Senseo or Pickwick was always a Dutch product that you could also purchase all over Europe and the States. Very limited in the States, but in europe you can get many pads for the machine, or make your own. But no tea. Funny thing was that even 3 years ago I went to Holland to purchase the tea and they did not know what I was talking about, I assume it was geared towards the European/US market.  Again love a product that is no longer on the market, Same with the Starbucks for tassimo, gone gone gone.

He chews all the chicken off first, which I think helps keep his teeth clean, and then goes to work on the rawhide.<br /><br />GREAT product, but the packaging wasn't too great. The bones were falling out when I got them... a little concerning.

review/summary: wonderful treat but doesn't last as long as other rawhide
review/text: My 30 pound puppy goes crazy for these, he really loves them.  He's just in heaven when he's chewing on one of these, but they only last about 20 minutes.  If you're looking for something that lasts much longer than a biscuit but doesn't need to last for hours like other rawhide treats then this is perfect.

review/summary: My ants must not like peanut butter.
review/text: These baits are peanut butter-based, as it says on the can.  The ants I have seem to be drawn to sugary things, but they leave these baits alone.  I'm going to try another type; I know some ants are drawn to some traps so I think it's mostly a matter of trying different kinds until I find one that these particular ants like to eat.

review/text: The ants (very small ones) seem uninterested in the bate and run right by it, completely uninterested.  Get boric acid/sugar baits instead.  Note: A large container of boric acid was only $4 at OSH (hardware store).  Search online for how to make boric acid ant bait.

review/summary: I'm the oddball here?
review/text: These baits actually worked GREAT for several years in a row on ants entering my kitchen near the front door - ants which would end up crawling all over the dish of dry cat food I had sitting on the floor in my kitchen (located near the front door). But then I ran out, couldn't find these baits in ANY store near me, and ended up buying other brands of ant baits - none of which have yet to work or even put a dent in my ant problem like this one did, and quickly.<br /><br />I can't really say if these Ant B Gone baits would work this year on my ant problem (same area - dry cat food dish on the floor in the kitchen), but my assumption is yes, unless the ants I have this year are different, so no ant baits will work this year?...don't know. But since I have cats, I would worry working with liquids and powders.

review/text: I've been looking for tea like this for a very long time!  Many years ago, a friend from the UK brought me vanilla tea, and I was hooked.  Since then, I've tried to find another tea with such a strong vanilla flavor.  I've failed. Until now, that is.<br /><br />This is a terrific black tea, enhanced by a beautifully smooth vanilla taste!  From the time you open the bag, you'll be amazed by the wonderfully strong smell of real vanilla.  And then, when you take the first sip, you'll be as hooked as I was, all those years ago!

review/text: We really enjoy the Marriage Freres vanilla, but it is extremely expensive. We are very glad to have found this tea because, while not cheap, it is a significantly cheaper alternative. I think that the coconut is what really sets this vanilla tea above others. It has a great, creamy flavor. I highly recommend this tea.

review/text: I love kalamata olives and just didn't buy them often because of the price at the grocery store deli. What a joy to find great olives at a great price. These taste great and let me use these healthy olives in my cooking. These are the real thing, not the canned black olives in cans which are actually green olives cured in lye (I like them, too, they're just a totally different product, not the healthy kalamata olives). I have these on subscribe & save which made them even a better value.

We bought them at a GF specialty shop for the first time and we tried themn as soon as we got home because they looked so yummy on the package.  We almost finished the package in one sitting!  We ate them with slices of cheddar cheese and we were in heaven!  They are very well packaged, so all of the crackers were in great shape.  I'm so happy to see that we can now buy them in bulk from Amazon :-)  Try them, you will love them!!

review/summary: These are great gluten free crackers
review/text: My husband was diagnosed as gluten sensitive a year and a half ago.  These crackers are the best crackers we have found.  They taste good.  Their "mouth feel" is good.  They are good to eat plain and you can cook with them.  They are a bit more crumbly than regular crackers, a common thing with gluten-free foods, but not as bad as many other crackers we tried.  Mainly, though, they taste GOOD!<br /><br />Schar is one of the gluten-free brands I trust the most and I am willing to try new products from them because their food is good quality and they follow standards for gluten-free products.  In other words, my husband doesn't feel sick after eating their foods (including these crackers).

review/summary: great for gluten free
review/text: I was relieved when I found these crackers as they are like "real" things that are not G.F.  If you are on that path, you know what I mean by that.  : )<br />My only criticism is that they crumble apart and several in the pack were broken.  If I could change anything about them, I would ask them to make them small so they don't break apart in transit and also to pack them a bit better to prevent breakage.  Aside from that, they are totally worth your money.<br />Good enough to serve guests who are not G.F. and they won't care as they are just good.<br />I'm trying really hard to find things that are good enough for all to eat so I don't have to buy and keep on hand two separate versions of all the items I need to have on hand.  These work.
