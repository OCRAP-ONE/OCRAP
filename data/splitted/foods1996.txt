review/summary: GREAT formula, but cheaper somewhere else
review/text: After reading the review saying it had two much sugar, I almost passed this up. My baby girl has been on this formula for about two months, now. She has not spit up once! She doesn't scream when it's time for feedings like another user stated. I love Amazon, but with the coupons I paid $15 a tub for these at my local Wal-Mart last night.

review/summary: Beware of package size
review/text: Be careful when you order this particular package. It contains only 23.2-ounce tubs. Even with free shipping and no tax the price per ounce is much higher than your local wholesale club. I mention this because the product first came out in these tubs at the wholesale clubs and looks the same as this package. The wholesale club tubs are 34-ounces.<br /><br />I'm annoyed by this because I don't usually price or value shop Amazon products. I operate on the assumption that Amazon offers the best value in general. If there is a small difference in price it's usually made up in free Prime shipping or tax. So beware on these grocery type items.

review/text: Ok so I was doing some research to find good deals on formula. I am not sure if many of you know, but if you go to the Similac website and sign-up to be a Similac mom they will send you frequent coupons in the mail. Not just any coupons kiddos. $5.00 off of any sized Similac formula as long as it does not cost less than 5 bucks. My baby is 2 weeks old and I have gotten these coupons in the mail twice already. 7 coupons in total. That is a lot of saving!Also, a huge plus is when you can use double coupons. Stack store coupons with the manufacturer coupons. This will help you save a lot of dough. Good luck and I hope this was helpful.

review/summary: Didn't work for us
review/text: This formula didn't agree with my baby and this is the one they gave her at the Hospital. She was very fuzzy and had lots of colic/gas pains with Similac. I thought this was just because she was a baby with an immature digestive system like every other baby. When she was about 6 weeks old she started crying while feeding and the pediatrician suspected that she had silent reflux and put her on Similac Sensitive RS. She did a bit better but still cried during feedings. After reading a lot of reviews on ALL formulas on the market, I decided to try Good Start. I am so glad I did. My baby is happy now. She is not fuzzy, has not colic/gas pains, and she doesn't cry while feeding anymore.<br /><br />On the positive side, I really like the packaging of the Similac formula. I also like the smell and taste and so did my baby, she ate a lot of this formula! Formulas like Enfamil and GoodStart taste really fishy. This is due to the DHA/ARA additives (which I am not thrilled about!). So Similac does a great job with smell and taste as they do have the DHA/ARA in them.<br /><br />I know some babies who do great on Similac Early Shield though, but unfortunately that wasn't the case for my baby!

review/text: I compared the price of these tubs with the original cans ounce for ounce and it is only a couple of cents more expensive to buy this product. I like the tubs becuase they are cleaner, keeps you from putting your hands in the formula to get the scoop. Also, I live 50 miles from the nearest store that sells formula or diapers and if I happen to get there to buy any their cost is several dollars higher than Amazon.com. For those of you who like to complain about the few cents it costs less at your local Target, Wal-mart, Etc....be thankful and remember Amazon is paying to ship it to your door. Thank you Amazon.com

review/text: My wife and I use Similac Advance. It was recommended by our pediatrician and our infant has no issues with it. As far as we're concerned, it's a perfectly fine product. The reason I'm giving this only ONE star is because of the ridiculous price. I don't know who the pricing genius is for this product but selling 6 packages for $130 makes no sense. I live in downtown Seattle where prices are generally a little higher than most places and even I can go to my local store and buy this same size tub for about $20/tub. Why would I want to pay more for a package that makes me buy in bulk? Isn't it supposed to be the other way around?<br /><br />Whoever is in charge of pricing, you really need to do a better job.

review/summary: Too much Sugar!
review/text: I came home with this brand from the hospital, so I automatically assumed it to be good for the baby.. instead what I found was that my baby would be screaming for more when I did not feed her timingly on the dot, which in turn I found out was because she had basically come off a sugar high and wanted more.  I had switched to an organic brand by earth's best which tasted a lot less sugary and she never screamed for more milk... plus it lasted longer in her belly.  They get around not having to label sugar because it's under 'lactose'... but you need your mommy tastebuds to figure it out.  I would not recommend similac or any other highly sugary formula..

review/text: My son is allergic to this formula, similac in general. He broke out in a terrible rash all over his entire body. He was on enfamil before that and had no problems and we switched to nestle good start and have had no problems as well. It has been shown that parents choice (walmart) is exactly the same as similac. I didn't know that. I tried out the parents choice because it was cheaper and yup, my son is allergic to parents choice too. So if your baby isn't allergic to this, go ahead and switch to parents choice as it is identical to similac and much cheaper.

review/summary: TOXIC hexane still in it!
review/text: RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!<br /><br />Martek advertises this formula on their website!<br /><br />"Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted. Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be "agricultural ingredients." Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as "necessary vitamins and minerals," which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and "other" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from "natural"<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg<br /><br />Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: "includes mutant organisms" and "recombinant organisms", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is "extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane."<br /><br />The patent for Life'sARA states: "genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid" and "extraction with solvents such as ... hexane." Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.<br /><br />Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom<br /><br />The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health.

review/summary: Unfortunately an Irresponsible Company
review/text: This is the formula given to us in the hospital when our son was born.  They insisted we take home the 'to go' bottles in large quantities, as did our pediatrician at every visit.  Logically we continued to run with this brand.<br /><br />We began feeding him the powdered stuff because it is cheaper and we would often buy 10 - 20 of the larger containers at a time (we live in a somewhat rural area).  We were very dismayed to learn that there was a voluntary recall on this product but were happy to hear that it was only a small batch from a certain area that was affected.  It turns out this is not the case.  We compared containers on the list from approximately 6 - 9 months ago that were purchased almost a 1,000 miles away (we had moved) with ones we had recently purchased locally.  To our dismay both containers were on the recall list.<br /><br />At the premium price we pay for formula we expect that the company has good enough quality control systems in place to prevent bug arms and legs from making it into the container - hasn't anyone heard of a sifter?  It was also upsetting that Similac attempted to spin this by saying that it was only a small area and a small number of containers affected.<br /><br />Luckily he switched formula very easily.

review/summary: This milk really makes our baby really sick!! :(, literally!!
review/text: Sorry to give this 1 star. but this milk really makes our baby really sick!! :(, literally!!<br />if your baby can take it, I guess it's a good one but for us, we had the worst experience with it.<br /><br />Here is our story.<br />My baby had been solely breastfed. After 9 months my wife was running short of her milk. She didn't have enough breastmilk for the baby and he didn't take as much solid food as we would want him to.<br />We gave him Similac Advance, it was recommended by the hospital. First Similac Advance Liquid, he threw up 9 times within 2 hours after half an hour of feeding. That happened twice. A few days later, we tried Similac Advance power, he threw up again! This time 5 times plus serious diarrhea for 5 days. He has lost 5% of his weight within 2 days. That's really bad.<br /><br />We were desperate. We took him to the hospital twice that week. The doctor though it was stomach flu.<br />However, I didn't quit agree with him. What a coincident that 2 different formula milk feeding incidents would throw my baby off balance. I'm a computer engineer and dealing with solving and debugging problems all the time.<br />I was firm with the doctor that this was not a coincident. I thought it might have something to do with the protein in the formula that my baby couldn't digest. We decided to try Lactose free formula (Nutramigen from Enflora). It smell and taste really awful (my wife tried it and she gagged.<br />As we thought, my baby rejected to drink it. Then I tried Good Start soy. Same story, smell bad but not as bad as Nutromigen. My baby also rejected to drink it.<br /><br />Now we were really desperate, not enough milk for him and he doesn't like to eat solid food!! He would throw up + diarrhea if he gave him normal formula milk. Phone call to 4 advise nurses, no luck! I finally search on the internet and found a lot of similar story to what we experienced (including this on Amazon reviews).<br />I decided to give it a final try, crossing our fingers really tight. Good Start Gentle Plus is our last hope or my baby would not have any more milk to drink. He's losing weight!!<br /><br />And then miracle happened!!! This milk works wonderfully for him. The only complain I would have is that it doesn't smell as good as the normal cow milk-based formula, however, doesn't smell or taste awful like the other two.<br /><br />My baby didn't quite used to the tasted in the beginning and didn't really want to drink it at first. So we tried mixed it with breastmilk for a few days.<br /><br />Now he is a happy baby, gaining weight, doesn't throw up and used to the taste of it.<br />My wife and I are now happy again :)

Instead of buying water I just refill it from the tap and re-use the bottle. Great taste and easy to make.

review/summary: Tasty and better than I expected for a shelf-stable product
review/text: This is the first Hormel Compleats product we've tried and I have to say, I was plesantly surprised. I'm not a foodie, but I do expect flavor from food, packaged or fresh.<br /><br />Others have commented about the contents matching the pix on the packaging. Pretty much it looked the same to me although the penne pasta and chicken are mixed well within the marinara sauce.<br /><br />Plusses:<br />>>Ease of use: slit some holes, pop in microwave for about 1 minute, 45 seconds. Take out, wait a minute or so, peel off top and eat. (Peeling it off took awhile. It seemed to have some sort of glue that stuck to the sides of the plastic container.)<br /><br />>>Flavor: The marina sauce was tasty and quite a bit better than some of the bottled marinara sauce I've had. Chicken tasted like chicken and penne pasta was firm (but not break your tooth firm) and not mushy, which is important to me.<br /><br />>>Nutritional Content: If the label is correct, this isn't too bad at all if you're looking for both good fiber and protein without exorbitant sugar or sodium. And with only 5% saturated fat, that's good for fresh or packaged.<br /><br />>>Great item to store at the office or a second home or anywhere else where food may not be readily available and/or you need some backup.<br /><br />This should not be viewed as a substitute for making your own pasta to order and using a homemade or other sauce, but it's not bad when you're starving and literally want to eat in three minutes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />>>Price, which varies depending on where you buy it. Amazon has good prices with subscribe and save but at the $3 and up that convenience stores that seem to stock it charge, not such a value.<br /><br />>>Availability. Not always easily found in our area. If you like this, amazon subscribe and save is probably the best way to get it fast, in quantity and at good price.<br /><br />I've looked online at the others in the compleats line. Not impressed due to very high sodium (why can't companies understand that most of us want low sodium. Really low. Folks who want more sodium will just add salt. Good spices and other flavorings can give us the taste we need.).<br /><br />I suspect that the appeal of this will depend entirely on your own tastebuds. If you're someone who regularly eats homemade pasta sauce with fresh pasta, this will be a tough substitute. But if you use bottled pasta sauce and packaged pasta, this is akin to a prepaid version of this. You can always rev it up by adding your own veggies (steamed or heated up frozen ones) with it.<br /><br />If this didn't require a microwave to heat it up, it would be a perfect item for an emergency food kit.

review/summary: Quite a rich flavor
review/text: These microwavable meals that don't require refrigeration are very convenient, although these Compleats are not quite as convenient as the Chef Boyardee products, where you simply need to remove the cover before heating.<br /><br />These are very light snacks, at just 10oz.  That may or may not be what you want.  I find I need to heat them for 2 minutes, rather than the recommended 90 seconds.  This particular variety has a somewhat spicy taste, due to the peppers it contains.  It has a rather unappetizing, muddy appearance.  You also need to stir it before eating.<br /><br />If you use convenience meals like this every day at work, then you need some variety.  This one is worth a try, especially if you are looking for something with a fuller flavor than most chicken meals.

review/text: Based on the ranting and raving of a traveling acquaintance I thought I'd try these COMPLEATS meals ... specifically the HEALTHY LIFESTYLE ones with lower sodium (Green labels). Storing at room temperature sounded good and the price is not bad. I've tried two, and trust me, they look nothing like the picture on the package. Today I tried the CHICKEN MARINARA. The label (picture) on the package looked very appetizing, but once cooked, it looked more like a brown mush. The list of ingredients mentions carrots, celery, onions, green bell peppers, etc.. After stirring around I actually saw ONE little piece of green ... bell pepper, I assume.<br /><br />The stuff has some taste, but has no resemblance to the pictures and needs bread or some other medium to digest it. I won't try it again.

The minty flavor ruined the meal for me, and left an aftertaste in my mouth that was difficult to get rid of.  Texturally it was pretty good for a shelf-stable prepared meal.  I wanted to like it more, as the price is reasonable, and the portion size and calorie count are good, but it's just too minty for me.

review/summary: Great snack!
review/text: These date paste filled cookies are absolutely delicious. They're more cakes than cookies, but either way, it's a filling snack that is simply delicious. The cookie outer layer is soft yet flakey. The date filling is sweet but not overly so. The combination is an amazing snack! I'm lucky to live by a store that carries these for $2.79. After seeing prices here, I'm glad I can get these relatively cheap because they're so good.

review/text: i was very pleasantly surprised to find those here. my husband has been buying them from the Mediterranean Food Store several miles away.<br />they are very good, if you like dates. to figure out how that tastes, imagine butter cookies with date filling. that's how they taste. Each is about 2.5" in diameter and comes individually wrapped so you can take it with you as a snack. for extra taste, and to follow the mediterranean tradition, you can pour POWDER sugar over them.

review/summary: Toasty, Nutty Matcha
review/text: Hazelnut is such a delicate, distinctive flavor, but it's captured perfectly here! Nutty, toasty, warming, comforting, and even a little buttery and smooth. It goes well with the matcha base, making this a light and elegant drink rather than the heavy texture you'd expect from a hazelnut drink. It's a nice, basic, everyday matcha, great on its own or for combining with other flavors.

review/text: When I ordered this Hazelnut Matcha, I figured I'd like it, but, I didn't think I'd enjoy it quite this much.  This is really, REALLY good!<br /><br />From the moment that I opened the package, I could smell the delicious aroma of Hazelnut.  I didn't even need to lift the package up to my nose, the fragrance is so strong and so authentically hazelnut.  I could feel my mouth starting to water at the prospect of enjoying delicious hazelnuts - one of my favorite nuts!  (It better be, I'm from the Northwest!)<br /><br />The flavor of the hazelnut is strong here, but, I'm glad it is.  It tastes so wonderful!  I can taste the vegetative sweetness of the Matcha, not so much of the bittersweet but more of the sweet here, hints of the bitterness are in the background though, and offer a nice contrast.<br /><br />Very deliciously nutty ... all that's missing is a nutty crunch!

review/text: This blend is really roasty. Since I am not a coffee drinker, I was less than thrilled with my purchase. However, all of that disappoinment went today as I added just 1 tablespoon of this hazelnut matcha into a basic scone recipe. I could not be happier with the addition of the hazelnut and I know that the matcha makes this a healthier alternative to the cookies I was eating with my black teas.

review/summary: ~*~*~My Girls LOVE these, PERFECT SIZE for Little Fingers~*~*~
review/text: When we first started giving these to our daughters we had to keep a very close eye on them(as with any solid food) because sometimes they would start choking and we would have to stick our fingers in their mouths and get these out.<br /><br />These do 'dissolve' pretty easily but your baby may take a little getting used to eating them like mine did. But in no time they knew how to eat these with OUT choking. I think at first they were just trying to swallow them before they got wet and 'dissolved'.<br /><br />We have bought Walmart Store Brand & these Gerber Puffs. Walmart Brand is Good but Gerber brand is GREAT! The Gerber Puffs are bigger making them easier for tiny fingers to pick them up, yet they are still a small enough size for them to eat. Walmart Brand have a lot of broken pieces so many of the pieces are tiny and my girls can't pick them up to eat them, I don't know that I have ever found a broken Gerber piece. I think Gerber stays fresh longer, it seems not too long after I open a Walmart Brand they are stale feeling.<br /><br />Since I have twins we go through these fast so we've found it much cheaper to order them in bulk.<br /><br />These keep my girls happy while my husband and I eat or get things done. Even if I have just fed my girls, if they see us eating they will have a fit. We put some puffs on their walker or high chair trays and they are Happy again. We even pour these in their play pen & they don't even make a mess. At a restaurant if my girls are getting fussy, we'll keep giving them puffs and they are happy. We give them puffs while we are heating their food, if not they'll normally throw fits until we are feeding them.<br /><br />We've tried the Gerber flavors: Bananna, Strawberry/Apple, Apple Cinnamon & my girls love them all.

review/text: Our little grandson loves his Gerber Sweet Potato Puffs. Sprinkle some on the table before him and he'll immediately start grabbing for them and putting them in his mouth. I like that they dissolve so readily, making them a safe non-choking hazard. The taste is actually pretty good though to me they taste more like orange than sweet potato.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it's not a major one, is that there is more sugar in the puffs than sweet potato. Yet, with only one gram of sugar in a half cup serving, this minor sin is forgivable.

review/summary: Good for a Teething Baby.
review/text: Our 11-month-old boy is teething and starting on solid foods. We've been giving him more and more solids for a number of months now. You'd be amazed at the things he loves to eat, such as french fries for example. In any case, my wife found Gerber's Graduates in a variety of forms and the boy seems to like them all to one degree or another.<br /><br />One of the varieties our boy likes is the Graduates puffs. They come in several flavors and the present ones we have are the apple-cinnamon. Previously we had some banana-flavored ones. In any case, the  specific flavor seems to make little difference. The little puffs are about 3/8 inch across and are star shaped. We give them to the boy one at a time, which gets somewhat tiresome. So, we place a small handful on his high-chair tray now and then. He attempts to get them all in his hand and then put them all in his mouth at the same time. What are you gonna do? He seems to like chewing them up, as best as he can, and we've had no problems with him choking or anything like that. It's a good product, but we, and the boy, prefer the Cheeto-like larger crunchies.<br /><br />Gary Peterson.

review/text: I'm 21, but these are great snacks even for adults! I first tried them when my nephew was a toddler. My sister got him these all the time because he loved them. She told me "Try one for yourself. They're really good" so I did. They melt in your mouth within seconds, so this is great for toddlers and babies who can't chew very well yet. As for myself, I'm a constant snacker, so these are a great alternative for me so I don't gain weight. They have vitamin E, Zinc, Iron, and Calcium in them. This is great nutrition for your toddler or baby ... and myself as well I suppose haha.<br /><br />So far I have only tried Strawberry apple and banana. They truly do taste like their flavors they say they are. This is another reason it is a great snack for your little ones. It'll help cause a much easier transition from these to the real thing (real strawberries, apples, and bananas I mean).<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. It's great =)

review/text: PROS<br />-great to start as finger foods (easier than cheerios to pick up and eat)<br />-dissolves quickly (less of a choking hazard)<br />-baby loves them!<br /><br />CONS<br />-stains!  As the baby drools on his hands or loses a half-eaten puff, it leaves a bright orange stain on clothing, rugs, etc.  Not easy to get out, and a lot of the other flavors are more neutral colored and do not stain as much as the sweet potato.  The last thing I want to do is have to wash his highchair cover and straps, rugs, clothes, etc because of bright orange stains all around.<br />-cheaper versions available (ie, at Target they have their own brands)<br />-does have sugar (I wish they can make a low or non-sugar version, because I'm pretty sure the baby will still eat them.  Why add unnecessary sugar into everything?)<br /><br />I started with the Gerber sweet potato, but I'll be sticking to the Target blueberry (because it's cheaper and doesn't stain)

review/text: These puffs are great for a snack for my toddler. He loves all the flavors of these, but banana most of all. My husband and I even tried one ourselves to see what they were like. In my opinion, the banana aroma is much stronger than the flavoring. It's not a bad thing, there's just a very strong aroma of bananas when you open the container, so if I hadn't tried these myself, I would assume my son is getting a flavor (sugar) overload. That is NOT the case. There is just enough flavoring to make these good. My husband (who HATES fruit of any kind and refuses to eat it) actually said these weren't bad. Coming from him, that's a huge compliment.

review/text: My daughter officially gives these 5 stars - she just loves them.  These were her first finger food, and they remain her favorite.  I'll add my own 5 stars because they're an easy, convenient snack, and unlike Cheerios, they don't make a mess when the child is just learning to eat (the Cheerios were dribbling out of her mouth and onto her clothes); I suspect it's because the fruit puffs dissolve more quickly.  I'm not crazy about the price - 1.48 oz. isn't exactly a huge amount - but on the other hand, I don't give her that many, so a canister lasts a few weeks (vs. the recommended six servings).  Giving it in smaller quantities should also alleviate concerns about sugar in the product (sugar is the fifth ingredient in the banana puffs).

review/summary: good flavor, melts in her mouth
review/text: When my baby got too big to eat mashed sweet potato--and didn't have teeth to eat it otherwise--I started giving her these. She loved the taste and the texture was crunchy enough to soothe her teething gums while still being soft enough to dissolve easily in her mouth. They're also a really great finger food. I put some in her tray and she'll eat as many as she wants and drop the rest on the floor, which we pick up and put in the bird feeder. Incidentally, the birds enjoy them too :)

review/summary: convenient
review/text: my toddler loves them,they are convenient,perfect for sitters house or on the go,and my boy likes all of them.walmart has them under 3 a canister i think.i usually get them there.my star review is based o how much sugar they have.i prefer to give my kid flavored cheerios,they have less sugar and better on price,they just don't melt in your mouth or come in a convenient can.besides the sugar and price,i love them.but i do pretty much use all of the gerber toddler stuff for on the go,and  when i am home i try to use a different sub,like cereal,yogurt or what ever the mainproduct is for that specific gerber item.my dad and babysitter pretty much love to have these on hand for mess free convenience though.

review/summary: Stain clothing
review/text: This is a good idea, and they dissolve quickly for babies new to food. But if a partially slobbered on one falls out of the baby's mouth and onto clothing it leaves a stain that proves impossible to remove. The puffs have a bit of an orange coating on them, it must contain food coloring. I've tried organic puffs and they don't leave any stains.

review/summary: Tasty, but very sweet
review/text: I bought these because I like the idea of a veggie flavor over a fruit flavor.  They really are delicious, but they are very sweet.  They taste a lot like a kids cereal (which they kind of are).  I prefer the Plum and Happy Baby ones because they have half the sugar, and my 11 month old doesn't mind.  If I try to mix the low sugar ones with the Gerber, she will go for the Gerber.  If you don't care about the sugar increase (it is really small), these are tasty and your child will eat them.  If you care about sugar, go with Happy Baby.

review/summary: A good choice for new crunchers and munchers!
review/text: I was pretty wild about these for awhile when my little guy started eating solid food; they dissolve easily and he has fun picking them up. If I put a bunch in his tray, he'll try to shovel them in, but if I put one at a time down he'll pick them up with a thumb and finger. He's fun to watch, learning new things.<br /><br />I do worry about the added sugar, so I've been holding back a little on these lately, offering them less often and giving him Cheerios instead. The Gerber/Nestle corn crunchies are a little up in the sodium, too. Kid snacks don't need that stuff, really, so I'm looking for alternatives, but I think these will still be around at our house for awhile; everything in moderation. :)

review/summary: perfect first finger food
review/text: We used this as a first finger food with our twins and broke them into even smaller pieces.  Our babies had lots of teeth by 8 months, so they were able to chew.  The puffs melt down when sucked on, so it's a great first "real food" for the little ones.  The sweet potato is not "too sweet" as most of the other flavors are.  Even my older kids (ages 5 and 7) like to snack on these.  I never go anywhere in the car without them.  The star shape seems to be easier for the babies to get to their own mouths when just learning to self feed.

review/text: I love all the Gerber Puff varieties and so does my son. I was eager to try the Sweet Potato to see how he would like them. He loves them!!! All was well until I removed him from his high chair and saw orange spots everywhere. He is learning to self feed and drools quite a bit so I when he was grabbing at them with his wet hands some of the puffs on the tray got wet. When I went to clean off the tray the puffs came off but everywhere there was a wet puff I now have an orange stain. I wouldn't be so mad of there was some kind of warning on the jar but I can't find one. I am really glad he was shirtless or I can't imagine what his clothes would look like.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I tried this after trying (and loving) the Tea's Etc Organic Coconut-Almond add-on.  This is a very good tea. It's a little mild for my tastes, as I was expecting the tea and ginger to have bolder flavors. (I'm not astute enough about tea to know if this is a blend issue or a freshness issue. Given the strong aroma I suspect the former.) That said, I really do enjoy it and just find myself using a pinch more and letting it seep longer to achieved the desired outcome. The aroma is wonderful and I think this is a perfect afternoon tea. (Who doesn't feel more energized after getting a whiff of citrus?!). The fact that the flavor isn't overpowering also makes it a good choice for folks who want to ease into drinking green tea. I'll order this again, but it will be awhile.  These "small" 3-oz packages last an impressively long time even with daily consumption!<br /><br />Update 9//11/12:  I paid $8.62 for this item.  I see it's now selling for less than $2...

review/text: I have been roasting green coffee beans at home for nearly a decade. Costa Rica Tarrazu is my favorite bean. I did not find this brand of this variety of coffee to be as flavorful as beans from my usual supplier. It roasts well. In the roasting process it swells more than my favorite brand but that is not a problem - just an observation. I thought free shipping might save me money over what I had been paying but the disappointing lack of flavor has convinced me to go back to my usual supplier. Unfortunately, they do not sell through Amazon.com

review/summary: Picture & Wording "Bulk" is Deceiving
review/text: Normally we use Florida's Crystals Organic sugar in the plastic jugs.  We were nearly out of sugar & decided to order 6 bags of this sugar since we were in a pinch.  When it arrived & I opened the box (light as a feather was my first warning), I was floored.  The bags were flat not filled like the picture.  They are the exact same bags Davidson's uses for most of their bulk teas.  However they are not filled.<br /><br />Okay, it says it's a 16 ounce bag.  If I wasn't on a organic sugar shortage I may have paid more attention.  You are paying for 2 Cups of sugar!  That's it.  Think about it.  Not only that but extreme waste in packaging.  I think the bags could hold 4 times the amount of sugar.  It's a shame I didn't think to take a picture of those paper thin bags of "bulk" sugar.<br /><br />The final insult was the mess it was to get the sugar out of the bags.  It stuck to the sides & in the creases.  Trying to get it out of those spots left the counter & floor with a fine coat of sugar.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars over 1 because the sugar is organic & at least that is something.  There is nothing special about it. If this is the only choice I have for organic sugar, I will settle on this, but I will not be happy - at all.

I like a good strong cup of tea, and this was much milder and less malty in flavor than expected. Also, when I opened the bag, the tea leaves were very small, almost like filings; not the "leaves" I expected.  Don't know if I just got a bad batch or this was a bad year for this type, but don't think I would buy again.  Will stick to their South African Kwazulu tea- it's delicious.

review/summary: A former Twinings tea drinker who switched to Choice Classic Black
review/text: I am a former coffee drinker that had to give up coffee due my inability to live with the much higher levels of caffeine that existed within the beverage - it was hard to break away from coffee, and I still miss it.  I searched for something that would be as strong as coffee, but which would contain less caffeine, and that's how I became a black tea drinker.<br /><br />I searched for the strongest black teas that I could find, and I found that I enjoyed Twinings's English and Irish Breakfast teas the most.  However, I became unhappy over the fact that Twinings's tea is not organic, and that it is not certified free trade.  I don't know about you, but I do not like thinking about the idea that the tea leaves from which my tea is being derived, have been sprayed with all kinds of chemicals - that is really not cool.  With coffee I did not care about it as much, but with tea it really bothers me to think about.  Not to mention, I don't like all of the unfair trade practices that render third world countries impoverished, simply so that I can enjoy a caffeinated beverage.<br /><br />Taste:  Choice Classic Black tastes tremendous!  I cannot discern any appreciable distinction between it and Twinings English or Irish Breakfast tea.  Having stated that, I do make my tea with double the amount of tea bags, to increase the intensity of the beverage, so that might help - but I always did that with my Twinings tea also, so it's not something that is unique for me to do with this tea.  If one were to try this tea with only one bag, I still do not think that an appreciable distinction could be discerned between this tea and Twinings, but that is just my estimation, however limited.<br /><br />My recommendation, is that for anyone who is considering this tea, or who is interested in finding a strong black tea that IS organic, that such an individual should try to obtain a single box of this tea, if you are hesitant about buying the pack of 6 boxes on Amazon.  However, I do not think that you will be disappointed with the Choice Classic Black tea - it is equally as strong as Twinings, and it really does have a wonderful black tea taste (in my humble opinion).<br /><br />Thank you Choice for supporting organic farming and for supporting Free Trade Practices!  And thank you Amazon for offering such a fantastic price of this great tea!

review/text: I purchased this Garam Masala from Amazon when local merchants failed to carry the spice blend.  It is absolutely delicious.  I have made two wonderful chicken curries with it and will be ordering more for sure.

review/summary: Garam Marsala...
review/text: I use this spice by itself since this is not a hot spice but it is a mixture of some ten different spices popular in India. It is great with anything with brown rice but I do add some kind of pepper to make it hot. Bravo.

review/summary: Great spice blend!
review/text: Honestly, if you do any sort of cooking, you have to have this spice in your kitchen. I have used this spice in various Indian and Ethiopian recipes/dishes and it's just perfect and authentic flavors. Yes, you can make your own, but why not have the garam masala already blended and already using the right amount of spice? Yes, It's a bit pricey and I'm sure one can find this in a well-stocked Indian market, but I decided to go out on a limb and give this a try. Glad I did, because it's great, and will last me a while.

review/summary: Great Spices
review/text: Was looking for this and one other Indian Spice, since I am from a small city I couldn't seem to find it.  Found it easily on Amazon.  The ordering process was easy and the product arrived right on time. The company it was from also sent a brochure of their other spices, will definitely order from them again!

review/summary: Very nutmeg-y
review/text: I guess I expected a spicier mix of spices, but this just smells/tastes like spiced nutmeg. But maybe that's what garam masala is supposed to taste like. In any case, I made a korma with this and other spices and it turned out ok, better than it had before without it, so I can't really complain too much. The korma just tasted a little too sweet, even with sour cream and garlic, and added black pepper and salt because it tasted bland. Someone should just make a powdered spice for korma, because I can't seem to get it right!

review/summary: Smelled Delicious, Wish I Could Have Tried It
review/text: The spices smelled heavenly when they arrived.  However, the product was poorly packaged, and the seal was broken with the spices leaking out into the box.  And, no, I wasn't going to try a food that was that poorly packaged.  Personally, I think sanitarily made and packaged food products are just as important as products that taste good.

review/summary: Chemical taste, ultra sweet
review/text: Unfortunately I found the Cafe Escapes excessively sweet and had a strange aftertaste,  I actually threw them out after my husband and I tried them, particularly after reviewing the ingredient list.  I recommend the Green Mountain "Hot Cocoa" K cups as they taste  much, much better in my opinion.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was so excited to get the Keurig Brewer for my staff (They have been hinting for months). I ran out and bought an assortment of K-Cups to surprise them in the morning.  I just tried the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, milk chocolate.  It was awful, watered down, too sweet, and left a terrible artificial sweetener after taste.<br />I hope to have better luck with the coffee.

review/summary: The taste is so artificial
review/text: This is my first review. Usually I am too lazy to leave feedback, but this product taste so horrible that I have to say something to warn people who want to try it. If you want to try it, don't! The taste is so artificial and it leaves strange taste in your mouth after you drink it. I don't know what to do with the rest. Worst buy ever.
