review/summary: Didn't work for my pet.
review/text: I got this thinking that it would be a great organic treat for my Lab/Rhodesdian Ridgeback mix puppy. I figured giving him a treat like this would really satisfy his chewing instinct. This treat is VERY hard. It comes in a rectangle shape that is divided in half and I tried to break it into two smaller treats and had a difficult time. My dog did not like the flavor either. He preferred to play with these rather than eat them. Usually he will eat a treat in about a minute but this treat stayed in his cage with him picking it up and dropping it for hours. He has very powerful jaws and he usually tears up most of his toys in a day or two, yet he did not wont to eat these very much. Whatever they put in this is not very appealing to dogs apparently.<br /><br />Your dogs may like this better (hopefully). Again this is a VERY hard threat so make sure your dogs don' t mind having to gnaw at it for awhile. Also, if your dog acts like it doesn't like it then it probably never will, so give the pooch a different treat.

review/summary: Dogs don't know "organic" is supposed to be good for them
review/text: We don't have a dog, but we pet-sit for the neighbors and were hoping these treats would be welcome.  Sadly, the hound just pushed one around the floor and then abandoned it under the table.  Is it because they're so terribly hard ?  Is it some flavor (or lack of flavor) that only dogs can sense ?  Too bad the hound can't read and can't tell why these treats should be such a good healthy treat for him.

review/summary: For the particular pooch owner...
review/text: Here are dog treats you can trust! There are a lot of treats for the dog owner to select from but some of them are a bit scary. Here is a product that you can count on as being safe for your beloved pet. I found it to be safe and nutritious and my dogs found them to be delicious! This size is best for the smaller dogs. My Jack Russelss and Italian Greyhound found them just right but my pound Pup and Bassets would have enjoyed something larger. Still, all were pleased and we can't wait to get more!

review/summary: My little guy loves these!
review/text: These are hard biscuits, so likely good for the teeth.  My little Maltese loves these.  I feel good about giving them to him.  They are square treats, about 1-1 1/2 inches square.  They are often stuck together with another one and need to be snapped apart.  My only complaint is that they care nearly impossible to break into small pieces because they are so hard, so they're not good for training treats.  But if you want to give your little dog a good sized treat (or I guess a smallish treat for a larger dog), these work great!

review/text: It's hard to review a dog treat past whether or not your dogs ate the one you gave them and then wanted more!  Mind did.  They were happy to have the treat and even happier when they got another one later.  Of course, my dogs are good eaters and one of them, which I rescued from the street when she was about 6 months old and was malnourished, is loathe to ever turn down some food.  (I guess they never forget what it was like to be hungry...)<br /><br />What more can you say?  They were a hit!

review/summary: My dog loved them
review/text: My dog will eat a lot of different treats, but it usually takes her a while to warm up to a new one.  When a new treat is introduced to her, she normally acts like she's holding out for something "better" and will try to wait me out.<br /><br />When I gave her one of the Newmans Own "cookies", she grabbed it right away.  These treats are VERY hard.  After reading the reviews, I watched her while she tried to eat it.  Her first attempt didn't break into the treat at all and she had a strange look on her face.  She dropped the treat and immediately picked it back up and bit harder.  She loves the treats and now knows it takes more jaw power to eat these than it does her other treats.<br /><br />I definitely wouldn't recommend these to somebody for a puppy, old dog with weak teeth, or a small dog (my dog is about 28 pounds and did fine).  I have to give it a 5 star rating just because of her immediate love for them, even though I can understand other dogs could possibly have issues.

review/text: I'm not sure how best to review the Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley dog treats. I mean, I didn't try them myself, so I can't compare their deliciousness (or lack thereof) to the other treats on the market. I can say that my dog seemed to enjoy them, wolfing them down without delay. Then again, she'd probably take down a bottle of hand lotion or a burger wrapper just as quickly.<br /><br />Still, it was good to see her working her gums on these treats, and her breath wasn't too bad afterwards. Another plus is the lack of stains or related mess on the floor once she was done. The seam in the middle is also a nice touch if you want to break them up for smaller dogs or multiple pets.

review/summary: Good Treat
review/text: I have two dogs, a pitbull mix and a toy fox terrier. Neither one are accustomed to receiving dog treats on a regular basis, just not something I do. (They get plenty of attention though, trust me!)<br />These treats are the stiff biscuit type. I'm not really sure what they mean by "Ranch Style". It made me think they were going to smell like ranch dressing...but they didn't. At first neither one of my dogs ate the treats, but then, ofcourse, there was the whole "You gonna eat that?" showdown so they had to eat the treats just to keep the each other from getting theirs. After they ate them they came back to the pantry to beg for more. Now when I get the bag out they like them enough to catch them when I toss the treats in the air and gobble them down immediately.<br />I like that these are all natural. With a lot of dog food products on the market, the stuff that goes into them is so nasty that I don't even want to touch it with me bare hands. Not a problem with these.

review/text: I wanted to like this product. I have 2 dogs, first I gave one of the treats to Giz, my 6 year old Zuchon who is a little picky.  He took one sniff and walked away, when I laid it on the floor he shoved it under the couch. So, I thought I give one to Pete, our 18month old bloodhound who eats everything and then some.  He wouldn't eat it.  I couldn't believe it, a dog that literally will eat wood, bark, dirt, etc and he wouldn't even put these in his mouth.  If he won't eat them, I would guess most dogs won't.

review/summary: Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats,
review/text: My 65 pound hound loves these treats, and she isn't normally a fan of lamb. When given the blind 'taste' test (this treat in one fist, another treat in the other fist), she chose this treat every time.  Smaller dogs may have a tough time, however, because these treats are hard as a rock and come in the bag as two treats joined together (each square is about 1.5x2 inches), which are not that easy for me to separate.  The dog loves the flavor and we like that they are organic and not simply made out of wheat or corn (which she is allergic to) with a flavor added.

review/summary: Keeping it simple, this is an excellent quality product for doggies
review/text: I will keep this short and sweet.  I have 2 dogs.  One (a fox terrier) can eat anything and suffer no ill effects, at least none I have noticed.  The other (a greyhound) will do poorly if given crap treats like Pupperoni or Beggin' Strips.  This Newman's Lamb and Barley treats was very welcome in my house.  The ingredients are organic, and Barley is one of the easiest to digest grains for dogs. So much better than corn fillers and chemicals they add to food.  When you feed your dog food that is colored yellow, red, or green, you are feeding them useless and unhealthy junk.  That doesn't happen with these treats.<br /><br />The biscuits were about the size of a domino, but thicker. Yep, they were a bit hard to break in half, but when my dogs can crush tennis balls in their mouths, these treats are nothing for them to chew and enjoy.<br /><br />Bottom line was that it did not give my greyhound diarrhea or gas, so that is a big 5 star in my book.  Plus, I like the fact that it isn't junk goodies, but has quality ingredients.  Thanks Newman!

review/summary: Newman's Own Organic Dog Treats
review/text: I swear, my dogs eat better than I do. And while my dogs are hardly picky, they definitely love these treats. I am a little curious about how there is stamp on the side of the bag that says it's not for human consumption. If it's all organic meat with no wheat or additives, why can only dogs eat them? More of joke than anything, just amused me. But there aren't a whole lot of treats in the bag and they're not cheap, so I guess it just boils down to the question of how healthy should a dog treat be, and honestly, how healthy are they anyway over the next brand? I don't know, but my dogs like them and that's a success for me.

review/text: I have three dogs. Two miniature schnauzers and a Giant Schnauzer.  I like two things about these biscuits. One is they are a large and hard biscuit, hard enough to forces my Giant Schnauzer to actually take the time and crunch them up rather than down them in one or two gulps.<br /><br />The second thing I like is they are bar type cookie and have an indention in the middle so you can snap them in half for smaller dogs.<br /><br />I haven't seen them for sale at any store yet so after my Vine sample was gone I ordered them here on Amazon and they were shipped by the seller rather quickly.

review/text: Just a few observations here: 1) We have a small chihuahua. These are way too big for her. We basically have to crush them to crumbs for her to eat them. Otherwise she carries them and hides them like bones, and, trust me, it's no fun to find to find a slobbery lamb/barley biscuit under your pillow when you go to bed! 2) What the heck is barley doing in a dog treat? It doesn't seem to me that dogs were designed to graze in barley fields, so why are we feeding them barley? 3) My dog seemed to really enjoy the flavor, so these at least have that going for them.

review/summary: Newmans New Zealand Lamb and Barley Organic Dog Treats
review/text: An Amazon Vines review of the Newman's New Zealand Lamb and Barley Organic dog treats. The product arrived timely and well packaged. I received one 10oz. re-sealable pouch.  Newman's states that the product is organic, which Newman's say means the production systems seek to provide food and fiber products of the highest quality. The treats are rectangular dog biscuits, that are about 1 inch by 2 inches.  Each biscuit is scored in the middle so it is easy to break the biscuit into two pieces.<br /><br />The package listed the ingredients as: Organic barley, Organic lamb, Organic carrots, Organic apples, Organic palm oil, and Organic molasses.<br /><br />Newman's claims that the dog biscuits do not contain poultry by-products, chemical fertilizers, antibiotics, chemical additives or artificial preservatives, no wheat or corn, and no artificial flavors. The biscuits had a pleasant smell and looked like quality dog biscuits.  But of course, the real test was, would the dogs like them. Well, the dogs devoured each biscuit I gave them and I think they would have easily eaten the entire bag at one time if I let them!<br /><br />This seems like a good quality product, which my dogs greatly enjoyed so I give Newman's New Zealand Lamb and Barley organic dog treats a 5 star rating.

review/summary: Apparently they taste pretty good
review/text: The real reviewer - Indiana Jones (aka Indy Bear) a 13ish mix that came straight from the humane society.  Over the last 12 years Indy has been through cancer, hip displaysia, severe arthritis, and several tummy issues that his vet referred to as "garbage gut" and now he's lost his hearing.<br /><br />Did I mention that he's a pudgy dog?  Maybe its spending the first year of his life in a pound, but even now - he LOVES to eat.  So when the opportunity to try a new snack came along, he informed me that it was my only choice.<br /><br />I do like that these are organic... not that my dog cares. But I still would prefer if the first ingredient was a meat or meat based product.  My dog has canine teeth made for gripping, tearing, and scissoring which means that the rest of his body is set up for the consumption of MEAT.  Not corn, potatoes, barley etc.  Now granted the ingredients in here are far better than a milkbone, but you pay for them as well.<br /><br />These come in a nice little rectangle shape that is scored down the middle (like a short fat graham cracker) I didn't bother breaking it at the score because he would know and not leave me alone until the other half appeared.  Needless to say - they are VERY hard, but apparently quite tasty.  I don't know that a little dog, or a baby puppy could eat them but since Indy is a 60lbs Australian Shepherd/Springer Spaniel mix (with a smattering of other doggies in there too) he had no trouble eating them.  Much like all food it disappeared quickly with little to no facial expression so I can only assume that they must be okay.  I don't know that I would go out of my way to purchase these - I did like that they came in a bag rather than a box, but would have preferred a more "green" bag rather than plastic.  If you are going to go organic, then go all the way and give me some eco-friendly packaging.<br /><br />Much love to Newman's for being on the right track and trying to offer us healthier food for our four legged family members.

As with anything "Newman" you pay a little more for the brand name, so the budget conscious buyer might choose an alternative, cheaper treat. I'm not sure you need organic for your pet but perhaps it's a little healthier and certainly can't hurt. They disappeared pretty quickly, but this bulldog eats everything!

review/summary: Great for Younger Dogs
review/text: My two elderly Lhasa Apso dogs loved these organic and healthy treats.  We compared them to the treats we usually give them, and they made it clear that the Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog treats were every bit as good as their old-time favorites---and I am sure they were much healthier.  The only problem we had was with the size of the treats and the hardness of them for dogs that are as old as our two pets.  We did have to break them up into little pieces but then they quickly devoured them, seemingly having no trouble chewing up the pieces.  We did a test by placing their old brand of treats on a plate along with the Lamb and Barley treats; they finished the latter first and were looking for more so I surmised they felt the extra chewing was worth it.  I would definitely recommend these for younger dogs with better chewing power than our 16 and 17-year-old family pets. Anyway, a "thank you" from Mopsy and D. J.

review/summary: One of the best dog treats yet
review/text: We have a two spoiled dogs who really enjoy their treats.  While they are somewhat like pigs when it comes to their extra dietary choices, they have been known to show greater enthusiasm for some.  We have also found that so many of these treats on the market are unhealthy and mostly comprised of fillers and junk.  We decided to try the Newman's Own because it was organic (which we like for ourselves so we thought it would also be good for our treasured pets), and it looked like it was a total package healthy choice treat.  We have also used other Newman's Own products for our personal food selections and have never been disappointed.  These treats quickly became the favorite choice for our dogs.  Our English Setter began salavating as soon as we opened the package.  If these don't make your dogs wag their tails in appreciation nothing will.  I have even thought of trying one myself, but whenever I open the package the dogs come running and since I don't allow them to eat my treats I would feel bad to eat theirs.

review/summary: My Four Medium - Large Dogs Love Them!
review/text: These "certified organic" (by Oregon Tilth) baked dog treats are made as a pair of attached treats, 1" x 1.25", separated by a "break" line along the longer dimension.  I put "break" in quotes because, these treats are quite hard & do not always break right on the line.  The ingredients list is "Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Organic Apples, Organic Palm Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols, a Source of Vitamin E), Organic Molasses".  The "Guaranteed Analysis" is Crude Protein:  9.0% min, Crude Fat:  4.0% min, Crude Fiber:  4.0% max, Moisture:  11% max".  FYI, despite being "certified organic", there is a "Not Intended for Human Consumption" disclaimer under the ingredients list.  Hence, I can personally testify to their delectability (or lack thereof)...  ;o)<br /><br />However, my "test panel" certainly can - if they could talk, that is.  Testing these treats were our four rescued shelter dogs:  Jolene, a female Pit Bull & Boxer mix, Niki, a female Boxer mix, Cosmo, a male Boxer mix, & Mollie, a female Black Lab Mix.  In the interest of full disclosure, the first three dogs listed are all eager & voracious eaters - rarely, if ever, do they turn up their noses at a treat.  Mollie, on the other hand, is far pickier, being a tentative eater.<br /><br />Once placed in a "sit", all four test subjects eagerly anticipated their treat.  For the test, I gave each of them a single 1" x 1.25" treat, having broken them apart in another room.  I gave each subject a treat, one at a time.  Jolene, Niki & Cosmo took their treat without hesitation (Cosmo rudely almost taking half of my fingers with his), while Mollie had to give it a short "sniff" (as is her custom) prior to gingerly taking it from my hand.  However, once in their possession, all four dogs eagerly devoured their treat, crunching it up in short order, Mollie included.  None of the them had any trouble crunching into the treats, from Jolene who is only 40 pounds, to Cosmo who is 55 pounds.  Once finished, they all looked back up with hopeful anticipation in case I had another one to offer them.<br /><br />So, based on these tests, I'd say these treats were a resounding success.  If I had to take anything away from their score, it would be to dock them � star because they are so hard to break apart.  Of course, if you have relatively big dogs, you could always just give them two attached treats at a time & forego this issue altogether.  Therefore, I still awarded them 5 stars...

review/text: We've tried Newman's Own dog treats before, and our 26 lb. French Bulldog loves them. When I saw this new flavor (at least new to us), I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting the treat to be so big, but that was my fault for not reading the package. My dog was a bit overwhelmed by the size at first, but quickly grew to love the treat. Of course, I never sampled the product myself, but I can only assume from my dog's reaction that both the flavor and texture are good. I would definitely purchase these treats for him again.

review/summary: Too big for small breeds
review/text: I have a chihuahua and while he did take this and try to eat it, it was just too big for his little mouth.  The treats are too hard to break into pieces and he wasn't all that interested enough to chew the bigger pieces.  Though I will have to say my dog has never been the dog biscuit type so that could be part of the reason he didn't enjoy it.  It's a good quality product made from great ingredients, but not every dog is going to like it obviously.

review/summary: MY DOGS DIDN'T DIG IT
review/text: Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, 10-Ounce (Pack of 6) were not enthusiastically welcomed by our two dogs a terrier mutt and a German shepherd.  Both dogs were kind of suspicious when I handed them their Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Style Dog treats in their 10 ounce pack of 6.  Maybe the treats were too dry.  Later the dogs munched on them politely I think to not hurt my feelings.  I tried them (Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Style Dog treats) and found them to be delightful with a shot of brandy.

review/text: My dogs enjoy any type of "puppy cookie", they're not picky at all. But I noticed that in feeding them this product they started to prefer this brand over all others! I am happy knowing they enjoy it, but I'm even happier knowing that it is filled with all sorts of good "real" food - not by-products and what not. I would highly recommend these!

review/text: I have 2 large dogs, one of which is rather picky with treats.  They eat these up.  I like the fact they are organic and healthier than rangular dog treats you get at the grocery store, which you have no idea what some of the ingredients are in a lot of those.  These treats aren't very good smelling or nice to look at, dry brown squares, but I'm not the one eating them. I would definitely choose these over other crap that is on the shelves.

review/text: I have four dogs, two males and two females, of the Heinz 57 variety, all sizes and shapes, and they LOVE these treats!  Since this was something new, they were of course a little hesitant at first, but after eating just one they caught on really fast and all begged for more.  As I removed each treat from the bag, I had each dog's most rapt and focused attention.  I like the ingredients, nothing fancy, just good stuff for dogs.  I will be buying these again.

review/summary: My dog likes it....what else can I say?
review/text: With an ingredient list that includes barley, lamb, carrots, and apples (all organic), and a nice thick size, this makes my knucklehead happy. He's a mutt of mixed fox hound and beagle blood and just this morning he coughed up a Brillo pad when we were out for a walk, so take that into consideration if you wish. He has experienced no issues on the other end either, if you get my drift. If you are somewhat conscientious about what you feed your dog, you can't go wrong with these treats.

review/summary: Hard treats to be loved by some dogs.
review/text: The amazon description page for this item says most everything you need to know, other than this: will your dog eat them?<br /><br />Dog owners know that each dog is different, some will eat anything you put in front of their face, and some can be VERY finicky. So, I'm not sure how reliable a source I am, because our 15-pound mutt is a little closer to the former category: if it's not bigger than her head, then she'll try to eat it. So, yes, she loves the few of these we've given her so far. They are hard (Milk Bone kind of hard), smallish dry squares that take some effort to break in to small-dog bite-sized pieces, so they test our dog's jaws a little, but her tastebuds don't seem to complain either. Frankly, I like having a treat a dog can't consume in 2 seconds, it's good when she has to work at it a little, both to keep her occupied and to give their teeth and jaws a little workout. Having said that, smaller dogs, weaker-jawed dogs (puppies or the elderly) might not be willing or able to make the effort unless you mash the treat with a hammer or soak it in water or broth for a minute... and why waste your time, just buy a different treat, right?<br /><br />As usual, there's some cute fanciful text on the packaging, and like all Newman's Own products, the net profits go to charity. What's not to like?

review/text: These contain all organic ingredients and the doggies gobbled them up.  What more can you say about a dog treat?  One of my dogs is a little fussy and sometimes turns her nose up at other treats but had no problem inhaling these and asking for more.  Do the math and decide if organic dog treats are worth the extra cash, but if giving you dogs the healthiest treats is a priority I can't see you going wrong with these.  Can't comment on the flavor.

review/summary: Great for large breeds
review/text: My test subject is a 100+ lb Black Labrador and he gobbles these treats up happily with a wagging tail and a trot in his 11-year-old step! They are large and rectangular in shape, very different from the usual treat that mimics 'bones', and thick but they go down just fine and I've not seen even so much as a crumb left behind. The resealable bag is nice as in the past other treats have come in from the store already infested with moths or their larva from poor packaging.

review/summary: Not Meant for Small Dogs
review/text: I was anxious to have our 18lb dog try these wholesome treats made with organic lamb, barley,carrots, apples and molasses. Our dog never refuses a treat, and so I anxious to have him try these healthy ones.  The treats are very big and very hard! Rectangular in shape with a perforation at the center, they are easy to break in half too hard to break any further unless you use a hammer and smash them.<br /><br />Our dog struggled, but was persistent and managed to eventually chew it and eat it. He liked them, but I would not buy them again, because of their size. Really intended for larger dogs in my opinion, so we will end up giving them to our neighbor's large dog to enjoy.

review/text: These must be yummy because my beagle loves them.  She really looks forward to her "treat".  They are crunchy and I like that they are healthier than most of the dog treats on the market.  Only downside is that I like to give very small treats and they are hard to break apart.  Of course my Zoey doesn't mind.  I will be looking for these in our local stores.

review/summary: My dogs love them
review/text: To handle these treats, one would believe that nothing short of a table vice would do much damage to them. However, before I had opened the bag for the first time I had already used the word treat in front of our Papillon and Pomeranian and, as any dog owner knows, there is no turning back after the T word. I was honestly afraid that my dogs might chip a tooth on these treats, and so I hesitantly offered one up under close observation. Amazingly, after being dropped and picked up a couple of times, both dogs dedicated a few minutes to the treats and refused to give up.<br /><br />While I would not imagine that these would be enjoyable, or edible, for my dogs, they absolutely love them. I suppose if they were human treats my opinion would weigh a little more on my rating, but they are for dogs and my dogs love them.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Couldnt Eat But A Doberman Loved Them!
review/text: I have a Chihuahua that eats anything and everything- even things that are not supposed to be eaten.<br />When these treats came, she wanted them, she could smell them when the bag opened and was going crazy for them. I gave her a biscuit and she played with it for a couple minutes and tried to eat it but she couldnt- was too big and too hard. I could NOT break it into a smaller piece by hand, they are extremely hard. I left the treat out overnight and she left it alone. A friend brought their Doberman over and she ate the treat no problem.<br />I am rating these treats a 3 because my small dog couldnt eat them and there was no sizing info about the treat on the package and really if it wasnt for a friend having a dog the treats wouldve been trashed.

review/text: Got these for our two large (50 and 100 lb) dogs, who love them.  The biscuits seem hard, they do snap in half easily for sharing with the dogs (one for each) and the smell of the biscuits, we agree smells to me like "ginger snaps".  Maybe there is ginger in them, don't know.  Our two big dogs love them, and they are given only as treats maybe once or twice a day. Recommended!  Minus one star for being really hard.

review/summary: Look & smell great, but very hard for dogs w/ small teeth.
review/text: The second you open the bag, you can tell these dog treats are quality. There's actually an aroma to them -- not like a delicious gourmet aroma, but still, they smell like actual baked food instead of smelling like pressed carboard / sawdust, which is sorta what I think when I smell cheapo dog treats.<br /><br />My small dog (Cavalier King Charles) loves these treats, but the problem is, they're almost too hard for him to eat. He has the small teeth and 'soft mouth' characteristic of his breed and has trouble crunching these up. It's actually a good thing, because it forces him to 'savor' the treats (AKA they last longer), but it's something to consider if your dog is old/missing teeth.<br /><br />Other than that, these treats are great. I don't always buy Newman's Own products, but know when I do that I am purchasing quality products from an ethical company.

review/summary: Baird approved!
review/text: Baird is my 1 year and few months old Shetland Sheepdog. His review of this product would involve a ton of tail wagging, enthusiastic sits, downs and any other trick he knows while he waits for me to hand him the treat!<br /><br />These treats seem to be really good. Baird loved them. They don't smell like dog treats. If you really sniff them yourself you can smell the hints of apple in them. Not having that nasty unnatural dog treat smell clinging to my hands for hours afterwards is a huge bonus as well.<br /><br />If you don't like to give your dog unnatural treats, this is definitely a good choice as every ingredient is certified organic. There is also NO CORN or other filler grains, which is also a bonus, especially if you ensure your dog isn't getting these grains in their regular meals. There's no point in keeping corn and similar grains out of their food if you're just going to hand off a treat that has those fillers.<br /><br />One down side is that, as other reviewers have stated, these treats are on the larger side. I'd say they are 1.5 x 1.5 inches in length and width once you break one in half. For a smaller dog, this might pose choking risks if they don't like to chew. I was worried about how Baird would handle them, but he's responsible in how he eats and chews everything really well. He's also a bit larger than a normal Sheltie. I plan on taking one over to my parents' house and giving it to their Sheltie Kiowa, as he is more the standard breed size for a Sheltie.<br /><br />I'd say, compared to say, Milk Bones, these treats are pretty pricey. However, with Milk Bones you get what you pay for; cheap treats. If you're OK giving your dog Milk Bones (I actually do as he enjoys them and I use them sparingly), you probably won't want to spend the money for these. If you try to ensure your dog has a healthy diet and want treats to match, these will definitely do the trick.<br /><br />Disclaimer - I received this, as it seems did many others, via Amazon Vine, which means I got the treats for free. This fact does not color my review as I treat every item from Vine as though I've paid for it. Plus I can't fake Baird's overly enthusiastic reaction. Though he acts the same way for Milk Bones as well, so who knows?

review/text: So I'm not going to taste these myself so I'll just have to rely on the enthusiastic reception by my wheaten terrier. Obviously the big draw here is the quality ingredients and assurance of the brand. I probably am more willing to spend on quality brand food for my dog than I am for me. I try to avoid Chinese food products since they have regulatory issues. No need to rehash the whole pet food scandal. That said it's easy to but junk American pet food too so I try to shop carefully. This seems to be a quality dog snack that the dog enjoys...

When first presented with one of Newman's Own Lamb and Barley NZ Style Dog Treats, he snarfed it down just as expected, just as he does with all treats.  But the next day, as he  saw me go for the bag a second time - he went ballistic.  When I gave him the treat, he retreated into the den with it as if it were a bone.  Same thing happened the third time. Conclusion:  Lucky says "Big Yum! to Newman's Treats.<br /><br />JMT

review/summary: Not a direct substitute for China-made treats.
review/text: I have been looking for alternatives to made-in-China jerky. Because of - I presume - the amount of meat required to make real jerky, this has been a difficult endeavor. Even product lines like Milo's Kitchen source jerky from China while making the rest of their products - the ones they can process with fillers - in the US. True Chews markets US-made jerky treats but the meat is processed with other ingredients into a jerky-shaped chew that doesn't much resemble actual jerky.<br /><br />Likewise, when I received these treats they were not what I expected. "Jerky," to my mind, means plain, dried meat. I thought the other mentioned ingredients would be added as a coating for flavor, but I expected a largely unprocessed product. In fact it is a cubed, compressed product containing significant amounts of grains and other ingredients as filler. My dog liked them but for the price there are other treats he likes better.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations of a treat labeled "jerky" are out of line, but I know a lot of people besides me are looking for a US-made jerky treat, and in my opinion this isn't it. On to Blue Buffalo Wilderness jerky. It is several times more expensive but so far the only "real" US-made jerky I have found.

review/text: My wife and I wanted to get a gift basket like this for her father for Christmas.  We weren't going to be able to visit in person this year and enjoy Christmas morning breakfast and thought a gift basket would be nice.  After researching tons of options I became frustrated that so often the shipping on products like this cost more than the actual products themselves.  Let's face it, a pre-arranged gift basket of food is rarely going to be a "value".  But when you add in shipping these things can be down right outrageous.  We came across this basket and it was available with Amazon Prime free shipping.  Not only that, it was less expensive than other alternatives we were looking at (some from other non-Amazon vendors).  We went ahead and ordered this.  It arrived exactly on time in excellent condition and, according to my father-in-law, it was excellent.  I have no complaints and was happy to find this option.  I was pleased with the company and Amazon.  Hopefully it remains "prime-eligible" in the future.

Add cubed tofu (soft is best), spinach or swiss chard cut into thin strips, shiitake mushrooms cut in thin strips and scallions thinly cut including the green part (reserve half for soup garnish). Heat, but do not boil, for about 10 minutes.  Servie with a splash of soy sauce for a little extra flavor.<br /><br />The Kombu has a very mild flavor and best if not overcooked or over softened.

review/summary: The right kind of seaweed
review/text: Being new at Korean cooking several recipes I intend to cook calls for dried seaweed.  The seaweed that I saw on Korean cooking TV shows was thin in texture.  I was so lucky that the Welpac Dashi Kombu Dried Seaweed I purchased on Amazon was the right kind of seaweed.<br /><br />It is great, so I recommend this brand of seaweed whenever your recipe calls for seaweed.

review/summary: So So
review/text: This is one of the first crackers I tried, yes if your gluten free it may work but doesn't hit the spot like regular crackers.  There are MUCH better alternatives for you.  The crackers are chalking tasting and no one in the family liked them.  We did find that Glutino nows sells a VERY good Table Cracker.  Little more expensive but they are great for your soups, chilis, meatloafs and taste just about like a saltine.  You can't go wrong with Table Crackers.  Also try nut thins - had more compliments on those crackers then with these. Don't waste your money on them (regular, cheese or veggie) YUCK!

review/summary: Glutino crackers
review/text: very disappointed with this product. Although the taste is good it was difficult to serve these crackers with a topping of hummus to other celiac friends. The two foil pkgs in each box does not guarantee is whole cracker. From one foil pkg. in the first box I ordered I had 5 whole crackers...the rest of the foil pkg. was broken pieces. This does not speak well for Glutino products. I will never order them from Amazon again.

review/summary: Horrible Pastey Crackers
review/text: Was making homemade Farmer's cheese for one of my cooking videos. Had GF toast points, grapes, and these crackers on a plate. Slid a knife full of cheese across the top...all going well... and then took my first bite on camera, had to fake a smile. These were very dry at first, and then turned rather pastey in my mouth. Took them home, noone in the family would touch them after one try. I ended up giving these to my active-duty hubby who took them to the base. He described them later on as "hard to choke down, even with milk" crackers! Nice try though. Keep it up. You'll get it.<br /><br />Other products by Glutino, like the preztels, are delish. Someone needs to come up with a good cheddar cheese cracker. Then I'd be happy.

review/text: I bought these at a local store (original flavor). The were awful. They not only didn't taste good (as is the case with lots of gf products on the market); they actually tasted nasty. I couldn't eat them. My son, who will generally eat anything, "loved" them. He kept packing them in Ziploc bags and packing those in cloth bags to take as a "picnic" item for wherever he thought we might be going. He had a lot of fun playing with them: however, he didn't eat them. That's saying a lot because he has a genetic disorder that effects his ability to determine when to stop eating and generally eats any food he can get his hands on and goes looking for more. Anyway, I finally got tired of looking at these crackers and tossed them out. I have bought other products from this company that were fine.

review/summary: Amonium Bicarbonate: Read ingred. list.....
review/text: Please investigate the ingredient list of the so called "healthy" alternatives.  Especially if your body is already sensitive to gluten, MSG, wheat, or other things.  Here is only one review of one of the ingredients in these crackers....<br />------------------------------------------------------<br />AMMONIUM BICARBONATE<br />Ammonia powder is ammonium bicarbonate, a leavening agent that is a precursor of today's baking powder and baking soda; it must be ground to a powder before using. It is also known as hartshorn, carbonate of ammonia or powdered baking ammonia. It is still called for in some recipes especially for cookies.<br /><br />It is suggested substituting an equal amount of double acting baking powder for the powdered ammonia (hartshorn) in a recipe.  (Your kitchen would stink of ammonia while the cookies baked, but the cookies would not taste or smell of ammonia<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br />Now doesn't that just make you want to gobble up these crackers,..NOT.  Most of the product comes from China....another caution.  It is preferred by some food processors because it is CHEAP....so how expensive is common baking soda &bakin g powder?

review/summary: Eww! I am going to have to disagree with the majority on this one.
review/text: I was recently put on a gluten & nightshade free diet. Having spent the better part of 40 years eating yummy snacks like cheese & crackers or peanut butter & crackers, I was very unhappy with the new diet. When I discovered that a local grocery store actually carried GF products I was thrilled to find Glutino Crackers.<br /><br />I managed to eat one. It was nasty. I tried again and again over the next few days to see if my opinion or desperation changed. It didn't. After staring angrily at the box of nasty crackers for over a week I decided they had to go. I took them to work to see if I could hand them off to someone else. Everyone tried a Glutino. Three people actually spit them out and the other two did not come back for more.  I'm not a fan of throwing away food but my husband wouldn't touch them either and there was no way I was going to get another one of these things down. They went in the trash.<br /><br />Nasty!

This is not necessarily Amazon's fault, as I doubt even if you lived down the street from the wherehouse they would arrive without damage.  My recent shippment arrived with moderate breakage, but the shipping box was clean (no damage), though the original container showed a little damage.  I would not order anything heavy to be included in an order with these crackers.

review/summary: Tasty, filling, but only four servings per box.
review/text: I am not on a gluten free diet. However, I find gluten free foods more filling. And so, I gave these crackers a try, after coming across them in my grocery store. I like the original and cheddar flavours the best (the cheddar flavour is very delicate).<br /><br />1) I have not experienced the breakage problem some mention. Yes, there is a broken cracker here and there, but nothing out of norm. Quite frankly, I think they pack them as they do, in two pouches, two servings each, in order to pump up the volume, so to speak. Each of these boxes contains only four servings (32 crackers). That's not much for the price. This is the only reason for the four, rather then five star rating.<br />2) They are filling and tasty. I am addicted to these crackers with red pepper humus. Yum! They scoop well once you get a hang of it (they are flaky and will break more often then regular crackers would in the same situation).<br />3) The box is made of 100% recycled material, for those to whom this matters.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />PS: There is a warning on the label that says they may contain traces of soy, milk, and sesame, in case anyone is alergic. Also, they do contain eggs.

I tried getting them from Amazon because it seemed like a better price. After I ordered them, I read the reviews that said a lot of the crackers were broken and was a little nervous. Fortunately, that turned out to not be a problem for me. A few of them were broken, but I've had that same problem buying them in a local store. All in all, a very good deal!

review/summary: Yummy but are they worth the cost?
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised when I tried these crackers - I am always a bit wary of trying GF products since so many have a strange taste and/or texture. These, however, are delicious. They do remind me of Ritz crackers (at least what I remember from eating them 2 years ago) except not quite as oily.<br /><br />Good:<br />- They taste good and have a really nice texture.<br />- I don't think they are exceptionally bland - they have a slight buttery flavor and seem like generic crackers to me. Definitely more flavor that water crackers<br />- I don't taste the funny aftertaste that one of the reviewers mentions. Perhaps some people are more sensitive to that taste than I am.<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Cost<br />- Broken crackers: I agree with other reviewers that the packages often contain a lot of broken ones. This is not just when they are purchased online; it is also true of boxes that I've purchased at a store like Whole Foods. I guess these crackers are just fragile and need special packaging.<br /><br />That combination of downsides makes it a tough choice for me about whether to buy these crackers. Do I really want to pay a lot (3-4x as much as "glutinized" crackers) for a box of broken crackers? I haven't decided. For now, they are a splurge that I indulge in occasionally.

review/summary: Changed their ingredients, taste awful now
review/text: I used to love these crackers and bought them all the time.  Even my family members who do not have to follow a gluten free diet thought they tasted good.  Then the company started adding sunflower products to the ingredients.  I knew with the first bite that the crackers now had an unpleasant "twang" in the taste.  I gave some to the rest of my family not telling them about the awful taste. They ate them without hesitation since they had enjoyed them in the past.  As soon as it hit their taste buds, they said, "YUK!"<br /><br />When checking out the ingredients, to find out what had happened to these crackers, I found the sunflower addition.  Unfortunately, besides the bad taste, I am allergic to sunflower products, so will no longer purchase them.<br /><br />I wrote to the company asking that they return to the original recipe, but never received a reply.

We started making "lunchables" for him one day by adding a slice of lunch meat and cheese and he loved it. He now takes "lunchables" to school once or twice a week using these crackers.<br /><br />On their own these crackers aren't bad, but they tend to be better with a topping of some sort (as with most GF breads and crackers).<br /><br />My only complaint is the packaging. The crackers come in two foil pouches. Often times many of the crackers are broken. I'd love to see Glutino package the crackers in rolls like Ritz does.<br /><br />Overall, these are a staple in our pantry.

review/text: I picked up a couple of these while I was visiting my brother in LA. When I took my first bite, I thought, "Hey, these kind of taste like a ritz cracker! Cool!"<br /><br />The second and third cracker though, I noticed a really starchy, floury taste coming through. I looked at the ingredients. Corn starch was the first ingredient.<br /><br />I tend not to like gluten free products made mostly from corn starch. They are light, sure, but kind of flavorless and powdery if you chew for any length of time.<br /><br />Brown rice flour or millet gives such a great depth of flavor, and it's an actual whole grain, not just a grain after all the protein and nutrients are taken out. Even white rice flour would be better.<br /><br />Corn starch, however is cheaper so I think that's why it gets used a lot.<br /><br />If you liked white flour, starchy foods before you went gluten free you might like these. If you prefer whole grains or even actual flour (not just the starch) I would try something else. I like Christie's multigrain crackers or brown rice thins.

I know if I am buying a Glutino product my family will love it. I love the convenience and value of "subscribe and save".

review/summary: love these crackers
review/text: My daughter loves these crackers with some peanut butter on them. They do come in two small packages inside the box. These crackers are good for poeple who can't eat wheat or gluten but not if you have other allergies. This product does contain soy,eggs, milk and sesame.  Great cracker at least according to my 4 year old ( she has never really had wheat so doen't know what products that contain wheat should taste like).

review/summary: Great GF crackers
review/text: These are some of the tastiest GF crackers. My 6 year old daughter loves them. They also look the most like non-GF crackers, which helps my daughter feel a little less self conscious when she takes them to school. Amazon sells them for a great price. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Taste Burnt!
review/text: These crackers are horrible. They taste burnt and have a terrible texture. There are quite a few other GF crackers out there, try them instead. I have tried many of Glutino's products (Macaroni and Cheese, pizza, pretzels, crackers, bagels, and their breads) and the only product worth buying again is the pretzels. There are getting to be more and more GF products available, try those (Udi's, Rudi's, some of Amy's products) instead.

review/summary: terrible substitution for a cracker
review/text: I've tried and tried to convince myself that these crackers are acceptable but they just aren't. If you are desperate for a cracker find another. I rarely throw any food out but I made an exception in this case. It is terrible.

review/summary: Good basic cracker
review/text: If you want a good plain cracker that won't compete with your topping of choice, this is a good option.  Not a lot of flavor, but sometimes that's a good thing :-)

review/summary: Crisp and not glutinous - but not much taste
review/text: There's not much taste to these, but they have a good texture and don't shatter when used for cheese and crackers or similar toppings.  I haven't found a better cracker for such use that's this substantial, though I much prefer the taste of<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00472U12O">Crunchmaster Cracker, Organic, Multiseed, 4.5-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.  We greatly prefer the Crunchmaster crackers for snacking without toppings and often use them for cheese and crackers even if they do break into little pieces because they're so tasty - but if you're annoyed by crumbly crackers that leave crumbs all over the place, I don't think you can do better than these Glutino crackers.<br /><br />And if you hate them, try crumbling them up and using them as a GF substitute for panko.

review/summary: Starchy Flavor and Mouth Feel
review/text: It's hard to find crackers and other traditionally wheat products that are gluten free.  These crackers are a poor substitute.  They don't have a good taste- just starchy and, well, blah.  No amount of cheese or cracker topping can fix it.  I recommend Crunchmasters Multigrain GF crackers. They are the best that I have found.

review/summary: Handle with care!
review/text: I like these crackers.  Or, at least I'd like to like these crackers.  They taste like "normal" crackers, and they crunch like "normal" crackers.  But they aren't "normal" crackers.  They're very fragile, and it doesn't help that they are packed in a foil bag rather than the sleeve-type packet common to "normal" crackers.  Most of these will be broken before they ever get to you.  My all-time high is four completely unbroken crackers in one box. A few are just broken in half but most are broken in many pieces.  Don't count on finding enough unbroken crackers to serve to guests.  It's a shame.  They could be good crackers, but this is too much to pay for cracker crumbs and pieces.

review/summary: Broken right out of the box. All of them.
review/text: Amazon's excellent customer service allowed me to receive a replacement box of these crackers when I started opening the bags and finding tiny pieces of crackers.<br /><br />However, the second box came exactly the same way.<br /><br />The taste of the Original crackers is a lot like a water cracker. Not much to it but it's absolutely perfect for whatever topping or filling you're using.<br /><br />I would order them constantly if they were not all broken upon arrival.

review/summary: Long search over
review/text: I have been looking for a cracker that kind of passes off as a saltine cracker. My Mom's recipes require saltine crackers and so having celiac disease I have gone without! Now I can enjoy some of the recipes that I have grown up with. They also are good for snacking crackers. I thought they tasted like a cross between saltines and ritz. My husband went with a kinda grahm crackery taste. They are the first gluten free cracker I have found that are not so crispy they crack in pieces!!

review/summary: Glutino Gluten Free Original Crackers
review/text: My son has been gluten free for at least 10 years and the products that are available to a gluten-free diet have grown tremendously.  There was nothing much available 10 years ago.  The crackers and bread usually crumbled if you just looked at them!  They were mainly made out of rice flour and rice flour is not good for main ingredient in making breads, cookies and cakes. Good crackers, or just finding crackers that were gluten free was not an option back then either.  These crackers rock!  They are so much like the real thing that I prefer them over the wheat crackers; saltine or keebler club crackers.  I think this cracker is right in the middle of the two as far as taste-like. The crackers have a real good crunch factor!  The only down side to my order was that the crackers in each bag did seem to have more broken then whole.  I was not happy about that.  But,  I will take taste over presentation any day!  I will buy these again definitely!

review/summary: I LOVE these crackers ...
review/text: I'll be honest, when I'm eating GF crackers I really want them to taste like a saltine/ritz or something that doesn't feel like you are eating a mouth full of hay. (Not that I don't like multi-grain stuff, I do.) I want the cracker to hold up to cheese or whatever I put on it AND not to break apart everywhere. This cracker has all of that - dry cracker taste, works as a carrier for other food items and doesn't break. That puts them a 5 in my book.<br /><br />What I would rate a "three" is how many you get in a box. It's just not much at all. The crackers come in two 2-serving packs, which if you are like most people that's really two 1-serving packs. Like most GF things these aren't cost-effective, but if you are buying them on Amazon they are a lot cheaper than the $5 a box that most stores carry at them at.<br /><br />Overall, love 'em.

review/summary: Awesome Gluten Free Crackers!!!
review/text: These crackers are the closest thing to the "real thing" I could find. No they do not even hold a candle to Ritz crackers & can sometimes be brittle (we expect that with Gluten Free foods) but they get the job done. I eat mine with peanut butter alot for a light snack. I give them 5 stars (the original), the other flavors... not soo much. One down-side is that they get stale very qucikly so I keep mine in the fridge. Hope this helps!

review/summary: Best I've Had Yet!!
review/text: They are not saltines, though I've heard Glutino makes those too, and they aren't Ritz crackers (a butter flavor GF cracker would be awesome, do they make those?), they are the best I've had. The texture is not your typical GF grainy, gritty texture, and they are far tastier than the rice crackers. My favorite way to eat them is with peanut butter but they also work great as a crouton alternative in salads, or covered with cream cheese and olives. These crackers do have a very mild sweet flavor but not enough for me to classify them as a cookie. Each box contains 2 sealed packages.

review/summary: Great-tasting crackers
review/text: These crackers are the tastiest gluten-free crackers I have found, and I have been looking for 25 years.  They do break easy, though, so spreading anything firmer than peanut butter on them will often result in breakage.  Because of the great taste, I'm willing to overlook this flaw.
