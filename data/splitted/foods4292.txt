review/summary: Best natural jerkey
review/text: I tried this when I was in Southern California and cannot find it anywhere in northern California.  I like it because it is poultry and has natural ingredients with no preservatives.  I can eat it instead of a protein bar, I can take it camping, it doubles as "emergency earthquake supplies".  AND it's not full of fat or sugar.  I find the price a little high, but i make sure to have the bag last for several days.

review/summary: Terrible low quality pressed bits in tiny bags
review/text: This turkey jerky is really bad quality jerky. It comes as a bunch of tiny extremely thin pressed bits in tiny bags. The little pieces are dry, bad tasting and look like they are reconstituted without any texture to them at all. I have been getting jerky from a place called Mountain America Jerky which recently raised their prices and so I am trying Amazon.com merchants. This jerky is really really bad. The other Amazon.com merchant I have tried for turkey jerky is Golden Valley which is much much better than this jerky. Don't get this stuff at all. It is really bad. Try the Golden Valley jerky also here at amazon. That at least has some decent flavor and you can tell it once was a turkey! This stuff is just awful.

review/summary: Am I missing something?
review/text: From reading the previous review, you'd think these things are like liquid gold.  To each his/her own of course, but I just don't understand.  I found these candies pretty awful to be honest.  The only passable flavors (Strawberry and Peach) accounted for a total of 7 out of 240 candies (I actually counted).  The majority was Green Apple, which was the most bland apple flavor I've encountered in a candy.  The banana tastes so artificial it's sickening, and the Grape barely had a flavor at all.  Not to mention the many loose wrappers, half-wrapped candy, and loose candy floating in the bad.  I found myself checking for razors like some sicko on Halloween who buys into urban legends...it just wasn't a good scene.  I'd say if you are looking for fruit chews -- look elsewhere.  Just my opinion of course.

They are so good that if you don't have enough sauce for a meal, you can just open a can and practically add it "as is" to create more volume. The only thing that I noticed is that the cans I was sent did not say "San Marzano" on them, but I would agree that they truly were!

Although not always in stock, when they are they are a must and they arrive fast and with no damage. The savings versus purchasing them at places like Whole Foods are immense. We have ordered them many times since we've discovered them on Amazon and will continue to do so.

review/summary: Great Product but Dented Cans
review/text: These are uncertified (no DOP) San Marzano tomatoes.  All 3 recent shipments had over 2/3 of the cans dented.  Amazon is aware of the problem and so is Mangia.  Don't worry about the label. The tomatoes are fantastic but only one star because the dented cans are unsafe and a potential health hazard.  Consumer Reports and others do not recommend consuming food from dented cans because of the health risk.  The risk is not worth it even if sold at 1/2 price.  Amazon needs to correct the shipment problem of dented cans!

review/summary: Why do retailers use Amazon as a dented can dump?
review/text: I ordered this thinking it would be a good way to improve my veggie consumption and it would be a quality ingredient for some sauce recipes. The product arrived in good time, box of 24 cans within an Amazon box with a few token air paks for padding. When I opened the interior box (which was sealed, with Carmelina Brand written all over it), Every Single One of the 24 individual cans was dented on the sides - so this wasn't a case of the package getting bounced around on the shipping truck on the way to my house. At the local grocery store, these would have been half-price because they were dented. Disappointed and ripped off, I will not order these again.

review/summary: Chili Lime Soy Nuts
review/text: Truson Organics Chili Lime soy nuts go with me everywhere.  I have a bag in my car, at my desk, on my kitchen counter; I'm telling you I can't get enough!  When I'm running errand's and don't have time to stop and eat I just grab my soy nuts and I'm satisfied until my next meal.  If I'm at my desk and feel my blood sugar getting low, and I need to finish up on what I'm working on, I grab a handful.  When I'm sitting watching a movie I have a bowl (no more popcorn), when our friends come over for dinner or to watch the Seahawk game I have a bowl of soy nuts out, (no more greasy chips) and they go great with beer.  My husband loves corn nuts but once I introduced him to Truson's Chili Lime soy nuts and other flavors he's never gone back to corn nuts!  Now we are both obsessed, and the best part is, there good for us.  Not all soy nuts are created equal.  Truson's are definitely the best tasting with the best crunch!

review/text: Honestly, you might think I am exaggerating when I say Truson Organics produce the best soy nuts I have ever eaten.  But once you try them, I am sure you will agree. Have you tasted the soy nuts at your favorite health food store? You bite into them and you get a puff of powder because they are so dry. And most are tasteless as well.<br /><br />Truson Organics, on the other hand, have just the right balance of crunchiness and moistness.  And the flavors are outrageously creative and delicious.  They offer a great selection for every member of your family's unique taste buds.  And Truson Organics soy nuts are a healthy alternative to greasy potato chips and other nutrition-less junk food.

review/summary: Surprisingly Bland
review/text: After reading the good reviews others have left about these chili-lime soy nuts, I expected the flavor to really "pop"...but instead, it was very, very bland. I found myself going to my pantry to get my chili-lime popcorn seasoning and pour gobs of it on these to make them palatable. Such a shame, as they are very high quality soy nuts otherwise, and well roasted.<br /><br />If you are expecting a savory, tangy southwestern flavor, these soy nuts will not please you at all. You would be just as well to order the plain salted version. As for me, since I foolishly ordered 12 bags of these(the smallest quantity offered), I guess I will need to now go to my supermarket and invest a large amount of additional money on LOTS more popcorn seasoning...

review/text: I love La Panzanella croccantini but was unsure about what shape they would arrive in through Amazon.  I have always had excellent service and packaging so I thought it was worth a try.  The first box came beautifully packaged with the air-pocket packaging.  The crackers were in great shape and absolutely delicious. I was so pleased that I started the Subscribe and Save feature having these shipped once each month.  The first shipment through Subscribe and Save was completely crushed.  There were 2 small sheets of bubble wrap for 6 packagages and there was nothing between the packages.  Only about 10% of the crackers are in a reasonable enough size to consider eating them.  I went online to customer service and found out that they can't be returned.  This is an expensive item that is fragile and is sent to you with no recourse for return when you're shipped the small fragments due to poor packaging on Amazon's part.  I wouldn't risk it!

review/summary: Precooked was not the way to go...
review/text: I really wanted to love this item. I have ordered from Burgers before. Their precooked smoked turkey is excellent. But I did not enjoy this prime rib. Why? I bought the 4-5 lb roast for Christmas dinner. I let it thaw in the refrigerator for 4 days and then set it on the counter for two hours to bring it up to room temperature so it would reheat evenly. I followed the instructions that came with the roast, preheated the oven and let it cook for about an hour at 350 degrees. As I was busy preparing the rest of the meal I felt confident the prime rib would turn out fine since it was already cooked. As I was finishing up the rest of the cooking in that last dash of chaos to get everything out on time I finally checked the temperature of the meat and was shocked to find it was only 80 degrees in the center!<br /><br />I know for a fact the entire prime rib was thawed so there is no way it was still cold in the middle before I put it in the oven. I didn't panic. Since my guests were waiting and everything else was finished I had to get this meat up to temperature quickly (to at least warm) in the center without ruining the perfect red color of medium rare. Unfortunately that meant putting this beautiful and EXPENSIVE piece of meat in the microwave. I had to run it on high for 1 minute intervals, constantly opening and closing the door until I got the center to 110 or so - at least so my guests thought it was warmed through. Because of how big the roast was, that process took about 10 extra minutes. Obviously it is impossible to cook a prime rib evenly in the microwave so I ended up with overcooked ends, well done second and third slices and a slightly pink center.<br /><br />As for the taste...what were they thinking? I tasted like it was injected with highly concentrated au jus. Each bite was too salty for my taste and there was a heavy flavor of beef broth and rosemary. I wanted to taste the beef, not the seasonings. It reminded me a little of carved roast beef you get in a cheaper chain buffet restaurant or cafeteria like Golden Corral.<br /><br />Are there any positives? Yes, I can't say I hated it outright. The meat itself was tender as a prime rib should be and the flavor while a bit overpowering, was edible. In fact, my in-laws said they liked it a lot (but maybe they were just being nice). Also, it was much bigger than I thought - that's a good thing. It easily fed 6 people and there was enough left for another 5 or 6 more slices.<br /><br />But for the $115 I paid I probably could have had the same results from my grocery store meat case. Sorry Burgers. I like your products but you blew it on this one. I won't be buying a precooked prime rib from you again.

review/summary: Not sweet-tasting candy; it's a breath freshener
review/text: This breath mint is hard, like coal, not chewy.  Fortunately, it doesn't taste like coal; it tastes like the strongest black licorice you'd ever want and maybe more.  I wouldn't have guessed there is any sugar in it at all.  It's similar to eating baker's chocolate because it is definitely a strong flavor but not sweet.<br /><br />Ingredient list, as best as I can translate:<br />licorice; sugar; starch; aromas [flavors]: powder of catechu [acacia], iris powder, natural mint aroma, mastic tree resin; lactose; dye: E153; coating agents: beeswax, carnauba wax, vegetable oil; vegetable fat; gelatin<br /><br />I give it four stars because it probably provides what it claims: "an inimitable taste, scents the breath, provides healthy and pleasant freshness" (translation), and it definitely tastes like licorice, but it is probably fair to say it is harsh rather than delicate.  I thought I'd throw it away at first.  Now I'm on my second container.  I've had it for about two years...

review/summary: Strongest Licorice to be Found
review/text: People I've shared this with concur that it is by far the licorice of choice.  The strongest licorice flavor in tiny little pieces, packaged in a convenient tin.  If you love licorice, this is highly recommended.  It isn't cheap, but not overly expensive for the absolute best.  Give it a try.

review/summary: Super-Strong UNCANDY
review/text: This is a VERY strong breath freshener - not really candy at all.  Extreme licorice!  I really enjoy the taste, which is very similar to Sen-Sen, but these are more "floral" (probably from the iris powder in them).  I would say they have more of a perfumey flavor, versus the somewhat soapy flavor of Sen-Sen.  Both are strong, bitter, little squares that most children and new initiates will probably dislike, but for adults who enjoy spicy food, bitter salad greens, or ESB beers and the like, these mints should be quite pleasant.  And the twist-to-open tin is a much nicer way to carry the mints than Sen-Sen's foil paper packet.  And even though they may seem expensive at first, they DO end up lasting for a very long time...very much an acquired taste, but certainly a taste worth acquiring!

Unfortunately, this chaou licorice does have sugar, but not much. I was looking for a product to chew to help me cut back on my use of Nicorette, but without harming my teeth, or adding weight. The chaou licorice is a good choice if you can bear the taste of licorice.

review/summary: My breath freshener of choice.
review/text: I discovered these little hard candies on a trip to France. My cousin, who is French, used them as a breath freshener. He left his tin with me and I have been addicted to them ever since.<br /><br />The size of tins are about the circumference of the circle formed if you put your thumb and index finger together. They are filled with what seems to be over a hundred of little pellets of liquorish. They are very hard and meant to melt in your mouth rather than be chewed. They do have quite a strong, distinct flavour, and you might find that it will take a bit of time to develop an appreciation for them.<br /><br />I usually pop 2-3 after lunch, since I don't usually brush my teeth at work. They are just sweet enough to replace desert and make my mouth feel fresh. The tins have a classy rustic look and they are novel and cheap, making them great for sharing.<br /><br />This bundle of 5 boxes will probably last your average person an entire year.

review/text: Let me start by stating we LOVE the Plum Organic Training Meals - they have been a wonderful tool for helping us to transition our son to solid foods.  When we saw this we thought it would be a great way to get him to start eating chunkier oatmeal.  However, this is just juice and cinnamon - no oatmeal chunks!  It literally poured out!  Seriously, Gerber stage 1 meals are thicker than this!<br /><br />The flavor is great - I will give it that.  Hence I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.  We mixed it with my son's single grain oatmeal to thicken it up and it made a great meal - but a REALLY expensive one.<br /><br />We recommend the other meals - but not this.  Hope they improve this.

review/summary: A GREAT GF, Dairy free, Casien free alternative!
review/text: This is a great product for those who need gluten, dairy & casein free foods.<br /><br />Of course it doesn't taste like REAL macaroni and cheese! Geez - do you really think you can get fake cheese or non-cheese to taste like the real thing?!? If you're looking for something to replicate real cheese or annies GF mac and cheese (which DOES contain dairy) then you will search in vain. You cannot get real cheese flavor from non-cheese products.<br /><br />However, if you're realistic and are aware that non cheese stuff won't actually taste like cheese yet you want something similar to mac & cheese then this is a great option! We really like this mix and the other roads end products. It has a unique flavorful taste. We tend to alternate this stuff <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXG8W">Namaste Foods, Gluten Free Say Cheez Pasta Dish, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> The Road's end is closer to cheese than the Namaste but again, those who want a real cheese flavor/consistency will be sorely disappointed. However, for those of us who cannot have real cheese this stuff is great.<br /><br />We mix in veggies with ours (you know the ones that are little squares of carrots, peas, corn, etc.) and I use hemp milk when mixing for a bit more substance and flavor. Also if you add a bit of trocomare <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLBSO">A. Vogel Trocomare, 3.2 Ounce Units (Pack of 4)</a> it makes a huge difference in flavor (actually trocomare makes a huge difference in the flavor of everything! We love it and use it on just about everything.<br /><br />So - for those who expect a real cheese flavor - don't even bother and stick with real cheese or change your expectations.<br /><br />For those who realize it won't taste like real cheese but who want something different and unique (and gluten, dairy, casein free) - buy this, it's great!!!

You have to be careful not to overcook it, it can "mush up" otherwise. Once you've figured that out this is a wonderful product. It helps my child feel "like the other kids" when it comes to eating mac & chreese. It also packs well and travels with us throughout the country, it is a real boon when GF/CF restaurants are hard to find and you are "eating in" all the time. This is a fast to prepare, good and reasonably priced product.

Much to my surprise, it was really good. My 6 year old son declared it yummy and ate two servings. This is a kid that DOESN'T like regular mac and cheese, by the way. My notoriously picky husband even said it was pretty good.<br /><br />I'll probably try it with plain soy milk next time to see how that tastes just for kicks. Please note that I didn't expect it to taste like Kraft. If that's what you are looking for, this may not be your bag. I was cool with it just being an interesting option to add to my limited prepared food choices. On that front, it more than succeeds.

I'm rating it as "average" because I don't think I would eat it plain again, but I might keep using it in recipes (depending how the rest of my gluten-free experiments go).

review/text: I was told by my doctor to go off of milk for awhile, so I started looking around for some food products that didn't have any milk in them.  I happened to find this brand on Amazon.com, but you could only buy a case of 12 and I didn't want to get that many in case I didn't like it.  I actually happened to find it at the store so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />As I was making it, I thought it smelled quite good and I was anxious to taste it.  Well, I'm here to tell you, smells are deceiving.  I don't know how anybody thinks this actually tastes good.  It tastes just like metal and has a gritty texture like saw dust.  I have to laugh at the side panel because it says that Chreese sounds like "trees" and that no trees were chopped down to make the box.  I'm pretty sure I know what they used the trees for.<br /><br />I paid over $3 for the box--it's pretty expensive.  I didn't want to throw the rest of it away if I didn't have to so I dumped it back into the strainer and washed off all the Chreese.  The noodles taste fine, but the Chreese needs a complete makeover.

review/text: A review for cookies?  Why not?<br /><br />My wife and I love Oreos.  Every once in a while she picks up a bag at the store and we eat some with milk.<br /><br />The problem is that we feel compelled to finish off the bag before they get stale.  Since all the kids are gone that's tough.  It's not really good for us and after 3 or 4 nights it gets kind of old.<br /><br />Recently she got a 12 pack assortment of cookies which contained Oreos, Nutter Butters, etc.  I wondered if there was a way to just buy a whole bunch of "snack packs" for Oreos and sure enough Amazon has them.<br /><br />Now we can have that 6 cookie "fix" without having to remember to pick them up at the store or worry about them going stale if we don't finish them off.

review/text: Three important details about me:<br />1. I have a ridiculously fast metabolism so I always want snacks.<br />2. I'm a student often stuck in long, boring lectures or labs.<br />3. I'm cheap.<br /><br />That's why I was so elated when I found this deal.  I already love Oreos and I'm always searching for small snacks I can shove in my backpack when I'm running out the door.  I tend to buy boxes of snacks and just cycle through them: peanut butter crackers, Nutty bars, bags of M&Ms, Moon Pies, etc.  The 48 pack of Oreos was my most recent one and definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />They're packaged pretty lightly in little bags of 6 Oreos and I find it to be the perfect amount so that I'm satiated but not wasting any due to losing taste.  One pack of 48 will last me at least a month (sometimes I eat two or three packs in a sitting, okay?) so Subscribe & Save seemed to be my perfect snack solution.<br /><br />Of course I didn't realize how much Subscribe & Save sucks.  The price on these literally doubled after my first month and I had to cancel my subscription.  That said, the product is great but don't trust subscribing through Amazon.

Just great taste, fresh and delicious.<br />Yours Natasha (DENMARK)

review/summary: Still The Best.....
review/text: I have had an Oreo addiction since just about the time I knew what a cookie was.  Its funny how Oreos have managed to hang on and become such a family favorite despite all the competition of much fancier cookies that are available.  No nugets going on here, chocolate bits, caramel, icing, or peanuts either.  Just a tasty chocolate cookie shell with a delicious vanilla filling.  Keeping it simple has been the best policy for Oreo lovers for decades now. These little packages contain Oreos that are a smidgen' smaller than the regular box or bag sized variety.  What the cookie and candy industry refers to as the fun size.  That might explain some of the negative comments as to these Oreos being rather cheap with the filling.  In my opinion the ratio is the same, they are just smaller.<br /><br />This 12 pack is an excellent buy on Amazon.  Buy two of them and you get free shipping and for the majority of us, no sales tax.  A fine buy if you have a lots of Oreo fiends in your home that prefer a measured amount of these great cookies.  Like a lot of other reviewers here I tend to eat less of them when they come in the little packages as such.  Great classic Oreo cookies at a good price.  Highly recommended...

review/summary: great for keeping family fingers out of the cookie jar
review/text: I love these 6 packs. I have three kids and I can easily make a snack bag for school with 2 each. And the benefit is there is not a bag left behind for mom and dad to graze on from the cookie jar. Great packagign for hiding in spots around house so the snack hungry teens do not eat them all in a day.

review/summary: Excellent sandwich cookie
review/text: Ok, for some of you (NAMELY Mr. A. H. of Detroit, Michigan), anything but a chocolate sandwich cookie, embossed with Nabisco symbols and filled with white creme is a travesty, but Golden Oreos are a worthy addition to the cookie line of Nabisco. These are vanilla cookies, slightly flavored with burnt sugar, filled with the familiar white creme.<br /><br />Unlike classic Oreos, the Golden version have not suffered much from having trans-fats removed. The cookie is still crisp enough and the flavor is the same. By contrast, original Oreos seem a bit softer due to the change in recipe.<br /><br />Another good feature is the fact that Golden Oreos don't leave a dark mess on your teeth. So you can eat one and not check yourself in a hand mirror afterwards if you are being in public. This is a very nice cookie with a cup of tea or coffee and a standard in our house for teatime or dessert.

review/summary: Hard to overdo it, with these prepacked snack packs
review/text: Each pack contains 6 Oreos.  That's a tidy size for someone who wants a little snack but tends to overdo it with a big bag of Oreos!  However, having 48 of these in the house has led all of us to a bit of Oreo gluttony.  You know how easy it is..."Oh, there's only 6, I'll have another pack."  As a result our box of 48 has barely lasted a month for three people.  So, I will probably not get this anymore because it's too tempting!

review/summary: Chocolate Cream Oreo Cookies 101
review/text: This is less of a review of the actual cookies; though I rated them 5 stars.  The real merit of this "review" is to provide  information that may help others avoid the confusion that I experienced when I received my order.<br /><br />I stumbled upon the product page on Amazon for "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream."  The Amazon product image clearly said "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream" and I had never seen that product description or package previously.  I had seen regular Chocolate Cream Oreos before and even original Double Stuf Oreos (with the white filling) in local grocery stores but never the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.  I put my concern about the potential need to buy new pants aside and I ordered a case of 12 boxes, which is the minimum order.<br /><br />I received the case promptly from Amazon.  When I opened it, I found 12 boxes that simply said, "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  I uploaded a picture of what I received.  I called Amazon and told some nice representative in India that I received the familiar regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos that I have seen in stores and not the Double Stuf Chocolate Cream I had been expecting.  He apologized and shipped another case.<br /><br />I received another case today and it was the exact same product that I received a few days previously: "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  Instead of calling Amazon, I decided to call Nabisco (Kraft Foods, Inc.) for clarification.  The number is listed on the package 1800-622-4726.<br /><br />The following is probably the real virtue of this review.  I was told that the package now for the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream does not say "Double Stuf" anywhere.  As I mentioned, I uploaded an image of the Double Stuf product package that I received.  According to Kraft, the only way to tell is the UPC and package weight.  The package weight for Double Stuf Oreos is 1 pound 1 ounce.  The package weight for regular or normal stuf Oreos is apparently 15.6 oz.  The UPC for Double Stuf Oreos is 04472700.  The UPC for (regular stuf) Chocolate Cream Oreos is 044000025298.  Since the package does not say Double Stuf anymore, I am not even sure what my local grocery carries.  I need to check the package weight and UPC at the grocery store.<br /><br />Therefore before you jump, head-long, into buying 12 boxes of this magical Double Stuf Chocolate Cream, you may want to check what your local grocery store carries.  I really do not see the logic in having 2 different products with the same package, but there you go:  that is apparently the case with Double Stuf Chocolate Cream and regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos.  I will also mention that it would be interesting to see a side-by-side comparison of Double Stuf and regular Oreo cookies.  My guess is that the difference is not as significant as you might expect since I initially thought my cookies were regular stuf.

review/text: I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie.  The icing is the same, but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie.  You can't really dip these in milk because they fall apart.  Not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of Oreo cookies (that being most of us).

review/text: These are always going to be more expensive than buying the single big pack - remember when oreos were packed into three plastic tubes in a plastic box.<br /><br />These oreos always come out crunchy with a very pliable filling that can be easily nudged-rolled off if you don't like the filling.  If Nabisco sold individually wrapped cookies, I'd pay the extra money as I usually only want one cookie.<br /><br />I will always choose to buy oreos packaged in as small a serving as possible despite the expense unless I get some kind of vacuum sealer.

review/text: Great item at $16 (on sale).  My problem with supermarket packaging is the problem that the cookies taste great but once you open the package for about a week the cookies gets moist and taste not nearly as delicious as when the bag was open.  So these small packages, I think 6 cookies each is the perfect size.  They will all taste great and crisp.

review/text: My review is for the product cookie itself, not what might happen if you buy food from Amazon. Oreo is a classic cookie, and while I can't say that I am a big fan of all their flavors, I really enjoy three flavors - original, Uh-Oh Oreos, and the top of the list, Mint Oreos. The flavor is strongly reminiscent of the Thin Mint cookies sold by the Girls Scouts. Unfortunately, they only sell their cookies once in a while, but I can head to my store any time I have a craving for the flavor of chocolate and mint in a cookie. I even like this better than original Oreo, and that's saying a lot. Nom nom.

review/summary: Chocolate covered Oreo recipe
review/text: Everyone loves Oreos. They're even better dipped in chocolate. I made a plate of them for my son's Cub Scout cookie auction and a plate of my cookies sold for $20. So yummy.<br /><br />RECIPE<br /><br />2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />2 tablespoons shortening<br />1 package Oreos<br />*optional: 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening<br /><br />**Before you begin, make sure everything is absolutely dry. Even a drop of water will ruin your creation.**<br /><br />Melt the chocolate chips with the shortening in the microwave for 1 minute. Stir until melted. If needed, heat another 10 seconds at a time until melted. Be careful not to burn the chocolate.<br /><br />Place one cookie in the chocolate and coat. Use a fork to scoop it out, tapping against the bowl and scraping the bottom of the fork on the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place on wax paper and let it set. Store refrigerated.<br /><br />Optional: To make it pretty, melt a cup of white chocolate with a tablespoon of shortening at 70% in the microwave for 1 minute. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and let it drizzle from the fork onto the semi-sweet chocolate covered cookies. If done neatly, your cookies will look beautiful.<br /><br />Hint: I do one batch in semi-sweet chocolate and one batch in white chocolate. Then, I drizzle the cookies with the alternate chocolate. Plate them together for an eye catching presentation.

Oh, how many times have I enjoyed an Oreo milkshake on a hot day, only to smile widely at everyone with a mess of chocolate cookie in my teeth?  *shudders*<br /><br />So, only downside to the Golden Oreos is that I don't think they'd be as good in a milkshake as regular Oreos.  But the pluses are many with the Golden Oreos... a crisp vanilla cookie that is very good all on its own, but sweet biscuits and gravy, the vanilla cookies are paired with a sweet filling.  They are addictive.<br /><br />If you like vanilla sandwich cookies, try the Golden Oreos!

We will purchase if they are on sale - generally 2 for $6 for the 13.5 ounce or one pound bag.<br /><br />For an alternative to Tostitos, we go for Santitas. A few years ago, I noticed they were coming from the same place if you check the back of the bag. Sure enough, Santitas also taste the same - couldn't tell the difference.

review/summary: like a crisp green apple....
review/text: Here is a drink that I will definitely buy again.  I generally do not drink sodas and my drink of choice is generally water or green tea, but the idea of a natural juice drink with sparkling water peaked my interest.  The can is 8.4 fluid oz. and is 70% pure juice and sparkling water, fortified with vitamins. The juice contains no caffeine, no preservatives and no refined sugars and supplies 10% of your daily allowance of Vitamin C, B6 & Niacin.  Very low in sodium at 1% and sugars, for those who watch that is 21g.<br /><br />As a weight watcher I rarely will spend a lot of calories on drinks but at 90 calories for the can, I feel like I can treat myself to something refreshing and different.  I liked the flavor a lot because it was not sweet like a sparkling cider, it was more crisp, like a green apple (think jolly rancher apple).  I would definitely purchase this flavor again and would love to try some of the other flavors available.

review/summary: A Mixed Bag of Flavors
review/text: I recently had the opportunity to try three flavors of Izzy: Apple, Blackberry, and Grapefruit.<br /><br />APPLE: There's nothing wrong with this drink ... if it weren't labeled "Apple."  The drink smells of apple, but tastes more like lemon-lime (and not surprisingly, lemon is one of the three juices used for flavoring).  I expect something labeled "apple" to at least remind me of apple when I drink it.  This does not.<br /><br />BLACKBERRY: This flavor is much closer than Apple in flavor approximation.  However, it was also the weakest of the flavors that I tried--that is, it had the least power, and when room temperature, the blackberry hardly came through at all.  Not that I routinely crack a warm beverage!  But even just sitting on the table, waiting for me to finish it, it warms up and loses flavor. Quite tasty when cold, though.<br /><br />GRAPEFRUIT: Oddly, I think this is my favorite of the three.  It tastes like sweet grapefruit--think "grapefruit Jolly Rancher"--and it is the strongest of the three flavors in terms of power.  If I were to buy any Izze on a regular basis,  of these three, this would be the flavor.

review/summary: Like pickin' an apple and drinkin' it!
review/text: This is one of the best apple flavored bevorages I've ever had.  It's right up there with that fancy sparkling apple juice that you get in those bottles that look like champagne.  The difference is that it's a bit on the sour side, and I like that.  It's like pickin' a just-ripe-enough apple off the tree and drinking it.  Yum!

review/summary: Tart and not too sweet ... perfect, really.
review/text: I've had other Izze flavors before, and have always been impressed. The pear was (and is) a favorite. But, apple, though seemingly more mundane, is every bit as good. If you don't know Izze's, these are very gently sparkling beverages that are light and refreshing.  The 8.4 oz cans are just enough to quench a thirst, or give you a sweet fix without too many calories. Can't recommend them enough.

review/summary: Fizzy Apple Juice
review/text: I received my case of IZZE Fortified Sparkling Apple juice and took it to work to share.  One person really loved it!  But most of us agreed that it was just  "Okay".  The cans are very handy and the size perfect.  It has a fizz to it that feels weird for a fruit juice.  It's the flavor that just tends to get old before you get to the bottom of the can.<br /><br />The ingredients are as follows:  Pure juice made from white grape, apple and lemon juice concentrates, sparkling water, natural flavor, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), niacinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6).<br /><br />It has 90 calories, 0g fat, 15mg sodium, 0g protein, and 21g of sugar.<br /><br />The company has partnered with Global Education Fund to help provide educational opportunities and resources for needy children around the world.  What a company - I applaud them!!<br /><br />While the taste is not bad, it is not something I would crave and seek out to buy.  And this was the general consensus of my coworkers as well.<br /><br />-1smileycat :-)

review/summary: Delicious Apple!
review/text: Simply put, this drink is delicious, and I didn't reach this conclusion on my own. I introduced Izze's Sparkling Apple to more than three people, and everyone who tried it loved it. Even my dad, who's pretty picky about drinks, really liked it a lot. It's not too sweet, it's not too carbonated... it's like apple cider with a twist! It's great!<br /><br />It smells delightful, and I liked the packaging as well. I thought the cans were some of the most appealing I've seen in awhile.<br /><br />I definitely recommend Izze's All-Natural Sparkling Apple, and I'm sure you'll like it too!

review/summary: it izze good!
review/text: Izze Apple is a nice, refreshing break from water and tea which I mostly drink when at home. I am not a huge fan of soda, mostly because it's so unhealthy but I do enjoy gingerale from time to time and this stuff is pretty good. The apple flavor is balanced with strong tang from the grape and some lemon, it does taste a bit champagne like - so I will agree with the other reviewers who say that perhaps it should be truer to it's name and have more of the main flavor than fillers.<br /><br />I will repurchase this after the Vine order runs out, the cans are small and cute and you can fit lots of them in your fridge, it's also a small portion so I'm not forced to finish a huge can while not wanting to waste anything. This stuff is sour and bubbly and lightly sweetened and I like it, it's enjoyable.<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/summary: Great sparkling drink
review/text: Although I love apple juice, I don't normally care for apple flavored drinks.  However, as many have stated, this drink is very refreshing.  The apple flavor is a little tart (green apple, not red) with just enough sweet.  Over the years, I have lost my taste for soda.  I can rarely drink more than one glass/can because it's so sweet and doesn't quench my thirst.  These Izze canned drinks are a nice alternative when I want something more than water.  Both the taste and the carbonation are quite mild, and not at all overpowering.  Plus, the smaller 8.4 ounce cans are the perfect size.  They fit well in a lunch box, too.<br /><br />Before trying this through Amazon Vine, I never had Izze before.  I don't buy bottled drinks because if you don't finish them, they go flat.  This makes Izze in these small cans very appealing.  It has a good shelf life and stays colder than a refrigerated bottle.  Since I received 24 cans, I was able to share this with my family.  My niece and her fiance (in college) both love sparkling grape juice, and this is very similar.  The main difference is that Izze has a softer flavor.  He liked it a lot; she wished it was stronger.  Another of my nieces thought it tasted like apple juice mixed with Sprite.  The general consensus ampong her college friends was "fizzy and good."  Potential buyers should consider that this isn't as strong as soda or many sparkling drinks.  If you're looking for a kick, this isn't it.  Personally, that was perfect for me.<br /><br />My family also tried the clementine flavor.  I didn't care for it because it tasted like Orangina.  If you like that, then the clementine should appeal.  I didn't and subsequently thought it was too strong (probably because I didn't like it).  My sister and niece, who do like Orangina, thought the clementine was very good.  Since I liked Izze so much, I decided to order the Blackberry flavor.  My family all agrees that this is one of the the strongest Izze flavors we tried.  It's a little tart, more like raspberry than blackberry.  This is the closest to sparkling grape juice in flavor.  I liked it, but do not think I could drink it as often as the apple since it is stronger.  Lastly we tried pomegranate.  Normally, I love pomegranate flavored stuff.  However, we all agreed it was awful.  It is almost bitter and leaves a strong after taste that is not pleasant.  I couldn't even finish one can.  It definitely comes down to flavor preference.<br /><br />Also, people looking for a healthier alternative to soda should consider Izze.  No, the vitamins it's "fortified" with aren't a significant amount and there is still a lot of sugar (still less than 100% juices!).  But, it's better than soda with no vitamins at all!  And being sweetened by juice rather than artificial flavors and sweetners is a plus.  The smaller size can is a reasonable serving, too.  The price is about average, with each can being less than a dollar.  I like the convenience of it being shipped from Amazon rather than lugging it home from the grocery store and intend to sign up for the subscription.  Overall, I highly recommend this.
