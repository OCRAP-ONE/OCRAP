review/summary: Exactly as advertised.  Texture of tofu.
review/text: These are great.  I will probably be a frequent purchaser of these.<br /><br />Upon opening them, they smell awful.  But if you rinse them for a minute in hot water (break them up up with your fingers), the smell goes away.  I never tried boiling them, but microwaving for two minutes does the trick.  Make sure to drain them after microwaving them - they expel some water.<br /><br />They definitely are slimey - but truly, they are the same texture as egg soup noodles are (when they are in soup).  So I figured I should go with a thin, wet sauce that was almost soupy.  I never tried a heavy sauce with them, but I have done several kinds of "gravies" and curries.  They taste perfect in those kinds of sauces.<br /><br />When they are dry they are exactly like the texture of soft tofu.  So if you can't do tofu, you can't do these noodles.

review/summary: Don't Expect These to Fool You!
review/text: I saw these noodles at a local international food store.  I bought two packs because my husband and I are trying a low-fat, low-carb diet and I had been craving noodles.  Before I prepared them, I found a very helpful review here on amazon that gave some great tips on preparation:<br />1. Drain and rinse in a colander or sieve for a minute to remove most of the fishy smell. It is there, but you can rinse it off if you rinse it well.<br />2.  These are very long!  Much longer than your normal fettuccine noodle.  You might want to take kitchen shears and cut the noodles into thirds.  I usually leave them in the colander and snip around the pile of noodles.  It's not precise but it's easy.<br />3. Dry fry it in a frying pan for about 10 minutes on Medium.  You will notice the noodles become more opaque.  When you aren't seeing much wetness (not really standing water) in the pan when you move the noodles around, they are probably ready.<br />4. It may not be necessary but I remove them from the pan, prepare the rest of the dish, and then add them at the end.  I saute them in the pan with the other ingredients for about 5 minutes.<br /><br />Possible Preparation?  Try some soy, ginger, garlic, and chili paste.  Then add some tomato spinach, and mushrooms for a nice stir fry.  Or, shred some roast, saute it with some carrot and onion, spices and maybe a little bit of red wine for something like beef and noodles.<br /><br />The verdict?  These remind me of ramen noodles but with a little more bite to them.  They aren't a perfect substitute, but they work for me. They satisfy that craving for a noodle such that I am not feeling deprived. If you're on a diet that does not allow noodles, or if you are just trying to cut carbs, I think you have to set the right expectations.  They aren't meant to be an exact substitute.  You have to eat them with the knowledge that you are looking for an acceptable substitute.

review/summary: different but good
review/text: despite all the reviews i tried them. i heard about them on dr oz and i actually made them like the package said to and i made the shrimp alfredo that was on dr oz and it was great! the noodles have a different texture to them when you are chewing but it is not at all gross or unappetizing. now dont be discouraged when you get them they look really weird, and when you open them they have a light fishy smell.. reminds me of when you catch a fish out of a pond that smell of the fish.. but its not that bad. kinda funny when you get someone else to smell it.. haha.. anywho when you fix these noodles you need to fix 2-3 bags because most of the bags are water and not enough noodles. and it says to blanch them in boiling water for a minute.. i did mine for about 4 mins and they were great. they really taste like nothing if you just try a piece after you boil them. and they take in all the flavors of the food you are adding them to great. i WOULD NOT make them like speghetti it is not going to be like you think. i put a jar of sauce in them and ugh not good.. but i also made homemade sauce and it was great.. i dont know if its the premade stuff or not..

review/text: I get these for my wife has who for health reasons must be both gluten free and low carb in what she eats.<br /><br />She is a very good cook and because we are on a budget, she has no patience for a poor tasting or poor quality product.<br /><br />I bought one package for her and she tried these and we immediately ordered this multiple pack. I've seen her use these in stir fry with chicken, vegetables, chicken broth and a dash of gluten free soy sauce with a pinch of garlic. She enjoyed that.<br /><br />She's put a simple marinara sauce with these and said they were really good.<br /><br />Tonight she made her own recipe for macaroni and cheese using these noodles with a reduced fat and sodium cheese sauce she makes.<br /><br />What I see is that she is eating like a normal person now. I've tried them and they taste fine. The texture is different from pasta so be prepared for that, but I think the taste is fine. She is more than satisfied with the taste. Says they absorb the flavor of whatever she cooks with them.

review/summary: Very odd texture
review/text: Bought these in bulk because it was cheaper.  Have the spaghetti, fettuccine, and the rice.  When you open the bag it has an odd odor, not necessarily what I would call fishy, more of a preservative smell that goes away when the noodles are rinsed.  I made fettuccine carbonara last night with the noodles. Honestly, the taste was fantastic, I mean who doesn't love bacon!  The noodles truly have no taste, and take on the flavor of what they're cooked with.  But attempting to chew the noodle was a different story! The texture is like nothing I've experienced and is kind of hard to describe.  You really have to chew these noodles.  The texture is a cross between spongy, gelatinous, and squishy shrimp or meat.  That said, the texture won out over taste, if I focused on the texture it took everything I had in me not to gag! For me texture is as important as taste, and I just couldn't get past it.  Since I have so many, I will be figuring out how to use them and I have some suggestions to make them more palatable.  First, get out your scissors and cut those noodles into smaller pieces, the less you have to chew, the better.  After you have rinsed the noodles in hot water, dry them on low heat in a frying pan with a touch of olive oil.  The noodles retain moisture and Without being thoroughly dried, they can make your dishes more watery.  If you have an iron stomach, and know you can overcome texture, these can be a healthy pasta substitute.  Do not expect them to have a pasta texture though!

review/summary: Not bad for zero calories
review/text: I was scared after reading all of one-star reviews saying that this stuff is inedible, so I had very low expectations and assumed that I would take one bite and throw the rest out like other reviewers did. However, I was pleasantly surprised. When you first open the package, it smells like raw shrimp. This is not a big turnoff for me. I just rinsed it in the colander and the smell mostly went away. I then boiled it for one minute per the instructions and patted it dry with a paper towel. I was surprised how much water came out. I put a nice spaghetti sauce on the noodles and took a bite. The texture is not the same as normal pasta. It's a little springier or rubbery, but the flavor was absolutely fine. It was actually pretty flavorless. I was expecting something horrid-tasting, but it was really fine. I look forward to trying stir-fry dishes with it. I think it would do very well in pad thai or something similar.

review/text: So I really wanted to try this product to avoid consuming calories late at night and was disappointed. The noodles are in a liquid that smells terrible. When you wash the noodles as directed the smell does not go away. I tried everything on the noodles to avoid the smell, hot sauce, tomato sauce, a bunch of spices, and gravy.. Nothing worked. I had to force myself to finish eating them because I hate wasting food. The concept is great but they are very unappetizing..

review/summary: Information for the first time buyer
review/text: I was not familiar with this product, but my wife was interested because of it's mention on popular daytime television.  Here are somethings you should know if you are unfamiliar with the product.<br /><br />1 star: The noodles come packaged in water, so one 7 oz package must be strained to obtain one 3 oz serving of noodles, very different from traditional dry pasta.<br />3 star: The package, noodles in water, is a bit awkward to store on your traditional pantry shelf, you can't really stack them, etc.<br />3 star: The noodles have an expiration date that is approximately four months away.  Don't order more than a few months supply.<br />3 star: Because the noodles are already hydrated, they do not really take on much flavor from cooking liquid, you better put them into a very flavorful dish.<br />2 star: Copared to pasta, these pre-hydrated noodles have a very slimy mouthfeel and they are not able to be cooked al dente, so they do not give the same fished result as a pasta substitute.<br />5 star: As advertised, they are low calorie, filling, and a great source of soluable fiber.

review/summary: Smells like rotten fish, texture like jellyfish tentacles, taste like nothing
review/text: Well this is my first review, so lets make it a long one. The reason I am reviewing this particular item is because you CANNOT return it. I had never order food (if this really qualifies) from Amazon, and simply thought if I don't like I'll just send it back. Wrong!<br /><br />My first impression was, what do I do with the liquid? The fettuccini comes in some type of brine or liquid preservative. After reading the package it says to pour the liquid out, rinse for 10-15 seconds, boil for 1 minute and then dry with a paper towel, after that simply add to your favorite dish. It is supposed to soak up the flavors in your dish.<br /><br />Ok let's give it a shot. I cut a corner of the package and started pouring out the liquid. uhh, what is that awful smell...? The slimy liquid smells like fish. I had to open the faucet and wash the liquid as it hit the sink. I had to stop half way and wash my hands, the smell was very pungent.<br /><br />I thought maybe this is an expire batch. So I looked for the expiration date and it read Nov 15, 2011. Ok, it is not rotten it is just the way it is. I got the strainer and just empty the rest of the packet in, liquid and all. I let the tap water hit it for about 30 second and took a swift, it still smell... so I man up and started washing the fettuccini by hand. It took about 2 minutes of running water and hand tossing to get all that liquid washed up.<br /><br />I had a pot of boiling water going and put the fettuccini to cook for about a minute and a half, took it out and rinsed it in cold water (not in the instructions). Check for smell and it was gone. The true test was on the taste; well... it taste like nothing really, no flavor whatsoever. As far as texture it resembles pasta in looks; however, if I had to describe it I would say is like a jellyfish tentacle (not that I have ever eating one, but how I imagine it to be), somewhat chewy and a little slimy.<br /><br />I did not have a prepared dish to add it to, so I added some parmesan cheese and ketchup and ate it like past. The verdict... it was a mediocre pasta imitation. Perhaps if I did not cook it myself but it was served to me, meaning I did not have to put up with the awful fish smell, I would have enjoyed it more. I just could not stop thinking, what am I eating?<br /><br />The only reason I give it a 3 star is because aside from the fish smell at the beginning and that, what on earth is this? bouncing in my head the entire time, I think it could become an acquired taste. Also, if added to a soup or some heavy sauce dish, I can see a potential for this as filler.<br /><br />At the end if you decide to try it, know that you may not be able to pass the fish smell and end up throwing the whole thing in the trash. I almost did. Also, remember that you may not return this product.<br /><br />Bon App&eacute;tit

review/text: I was really shocked when I had tried the product for the first time. I expected it to have an odd taste, or a weird texture. It couldn't have been further from the truth. The noodles have no taste, instead you experience the taste of your dish's base. The flavor really clings to the noodles well. I've had it with a spicy seafood soup and another dish with Prague sauce. So far it's been great.

I soaked it in seasoning and olive oil overnight to get rid of the smell...it did.  I cooked it again and mixed with a white sauce.  I am very picky about food textures, and this was the worst I've ever tried.  It had a rubbery texture and was literally like chewing rubber bands.  I couldn't break it apart after chewing for a while.  I ended up throwing it all out, which was a waste of money.  It should NOT be called a noodle, despite its shape!  It tastes NOTHING like a noodle.

review/summary: Great pasta replacement
review/text: Let's be honest right off the bat .. yes, they stink when you first open the bag.  There, I said it.  But after you rinse them for about 15-30 seconds, then par-boil them quickly that goes away.  What you're left with is a noodle fit for soup; or eat them with a little added sauce (don't drown them); or olive oil, garlic, and tomatoes; they're slurpy and they take on the flavors of whatever you add to them.  Great for those of trying to cut down on, or abstain from, regular pasta.  These are high in fiber, and have almost zero calories - yeah, you heard me :-)  Unlike regular Shitake noodles, these do not need to be refrigerated until after the package is opened.  These are a noodle lover's, low-carb eater's friend.

review/summary: Not great for first time dieters or non-vegetarians
review/text: To like this product you really have to NOT expect to taste an actual noodle. There's no dough taste, no noodle texture, etc.<br /><br />The "pasta" part really only comes from the fact that they're cut into noodle-like shapes but that's where the similarities end. Do not listen to any of the reviews that tell you this tastes just like real pasta- it doesn't. At all.<br /><br />First off you need to not be sensitive to what the noodles initially look and smell like. When you open the bag you will be hit with a horrible smell that I'm told is the water it's packaged in more than anything else. If you drain the noodles and give them a quick rinse off in cold water you'll get rid of the smell pretty quickly. Also, the noodles themselves look and feel like squishy, raw calamari right out of the bag. That and the smell certainly doesn't help get you hungry but again, rinse it off and you'll get rid of the smell.<br /><br />After that you really need only drop the noodles into some boiling water for a minute or two to cook them and you're good to go so really the longest part of preparing the noodles is boiling the water and/or cooking whatever else you plan on adding to it.<br /><br />The best way I can describe the texture is that its like the pink pieces of ginger you get with sushi but obviouly without the same flavor. The noodles themselves are relatively bland so theoretically they should take on the taste of whatever sauce you cook it with but I didn't find this to be true. It's a weird texture, to be sure, but the noodles don't have much of a taste on their own so I can't really say the taste bad.<br /><br />If you're a vegetarian or a vegan who is used to eating "strange" things, tofu, etc then you might love this product as it definitely has that kind of feel to it. If you're a pasta lover this is nowhere near as good as real pasta and if you're a low-carb dieter looking for a way to cheat and get a pasta fix I think you'll be disappointed with it. Still, they're relatively healthy and relatively inexpensive so they just might be worth a try if you're looking for a pasta alternative just be warned that it doesn't taste like pasta.<br /><br />I would never order this in a restaurant and I won't be purchasing them again but if I went to a new girlfriend's mother's house for dinner and she served these up I would be able to eat them without a problem :-)

review/text: This is a great help in cutting back on pastas.  It has a somewhat 'fishy' smell when opened but once it is rinced in water, it's much better.  Product does not have much taste, so the sauce or veggies are what you are tasting.  Still gives you the feeling of eating pasta.

review/text: I was so happy I tried these noodles! Allergic to Gluten,Potato,Rice,and Corn, I thought pasta was out of the question.<br />Following the package instructions for preparation, I did not find these to be rubbery as another review claimed. They do have a different texture than wheat, but still wonderful! I had "spaghetti and meatballs" for the first time in years!<br />If you are buying these because of allergies, I think you will be happy. My 3yr old enjoyed them as well!

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: I almost threw up after one bite.  I might be preparing  them wrong, and I think angel hair or something thinner than the fettuccine might be more tolerable, but I'd rather have the few calories in egg noodles than these.  The odor after opening the bag really is disgusting.  It's just like rotten fish.  After a second try at boiling them (four minutes rather than one) and drying them a bit longer (though perhaps still not long enough) I managed to get rid of the smell mostly and they don't have a flavor.  The texture, on the other hand, is unbearable to me.  Rubbery?  More like slimy. They are so slimy and chewy, they must resemble raw squid.  I don't think it's like rubber bands, because I doubt chewing on a  rubber band would make me want to throw up.<br />They are far too expensive for something hardly fit for human consumption.  SAVE MONEY, BUY EGG NOODLES!

review/summary: zero-calorie filler
review/text: I have been eating these for months. I also enjoy kelp noodles (low but not zero calorie) but these are different in many ways. They do have an initial odd smell but once rinsed, they are fine. They don't require any cooking. I add them to almost any, already prepared carbohydrate. Yes, of course you could use them in place of pasta in the expected dishes but many of us largely gave up pasta years ago during the Atkins craze. 80) For those of us who don't eat pasta regularly, I would recommend integrating them into rice or whatever the carb. I'm personally reluctant to cut out carb calories completely; so mixing them to reduce my intake works best for me. Think of them as filler, which they are. Their consistency is sort of gelatinous but similar to al dente pasta (except that they don't stick to your teeth). Because of their consistency, I'm not sure I would add them to purees, unless using the puree like a sauce. For a low-calorie meal with this fettuccine variety, I like to prepare them with a Thai peanut sauce using PB2 and other healthier alternatives (e.g., apple sauce in place of oil, etc). I usually add spinach, and chicken to increase protein levels. I prefer this variety of miracle noodle - and sometimes cut the noodles to meet my needs - but they do have other shapes/cuts that might work better with a wider variety of recipes. They also sell a variety that includes soy (and consequently contains some calories) - for those who still embrace soy as a protein-rich carb.

review/summary: Perfect for Asian dishes!
review/text: Don't let then negative reviews deter you from trying these. If you're expecting them to taste like something from Olive Garden right out of the package, you'll be pretty disappointed. They are nothing like the standard Italian-style pasta, but if you know how to cook - they are GREAT. I make mine in spicy Asian-inspired dishes. Follow the directions on the package and you'll have a nice addition to your meal. (I would never even attempt to eat these plain) They turn what would normally be a 500-600 calorie dish into less than 100 for a very similar flavor. They absorb the flavor of the sauce/soup you put them in. I make them for lunches a day or so ahead of time and store them with the noodles on the bottom so they soak up as much flavor as possible.

review/summary: Weird, Alien, Edible, Pretty Good
review/text: If you're eating these, it probably isn't because you are looking for the most flavorful, best-on-tooth noodle you can find.<br /><br />You are eating these because you are interested in low calorie or extremely high fiber food products.<br /><br />We ordered these from Amazon and the first time we tried them, they were .. weird. We'd made an oily sauce with garlic and ginger and it pretty much wouldn't come near the noodles. The noodles absorbed none of the sauce, they sat in different sides of the bowl and we were left with eating alien, rubbery, flavorless* weirdness in a bowl of oil. Not recommended.<br /><br />The second time we prepared them (each bag is really one small serving) I beta-tested a few noodles with my sauce before making the whole batch of noodles to make sure we didn't have the same experience again. A simple tomato / red sauce worked really well. Classico-brand sauce with additional garlic, salt, and veggies.<br /><br />The main annoyance is that they cling together and clump in weird ways, but it's only so bad and seems like it might be a trick I could get better at managing.<br /><br />I would give these 2-3 stars if I were comparing them to pasta. There is a slightly odd not-quite fishy smell, rinse well before using.<br /><br />But, for zero-calorie, high-fiber, alien noodle weirdness, these are pretty great.

Seems there is almost an endless supply for $20, and the bag is easy to reseal for storage. A great treat if I want something sweet and caffeinated.

review/summary: SIMPLY THE BEST!
review/text: I was skeptical when I received my Orange Blossom honey and noticed how clean it was for being raw and unfiltered. Most raw and unfiltered honey is creamy tan/brown so, I gave the company a call. I spoke with John and he was just the most helpful person and he explained their filtration process was very minimal (which was what I need) and yes indeed, the honey IS raw and has all the goodness of raw honey, without all the waxy material and other things that could get into honey during the collection/pouring process.<br /><br />But the taste- Oh, the taste is magnificent! It is probably the best honey I ever tasted and goes GREAT in brewed cinnamon tea. It has a real light smooth flavor (not "bitey" like some honeys). And with the squeezable bottle- The only thing better would be letting the honey drip right off the comb into your jar, it's that easy to squeeze!  You can't go wrong with this honey!

The next time I was at my local Trader Joe's they were out of stock, and I was told it's only a holiday item and lasted barely two weeks on our shelves.  I am in major withdrawal mode and glad there are other vendors still selling this product, because I think I need it to live now.<br /><br />It's perfectly chocolatey, perfectly rich, perfectly sweetened.  Makes amazing hot chocolate, and a to-die-for rich sipping chocolate that's not too sweet.  It chases away depression better than any drug.  I have petitioned the company to stock this product year-round, and next time I see it at my local TJs I am clearing out their stock.

review/text: After reading how many people were trying these new pop tarts, I had to go buy some.  I bought 4 boxes of them!  And I'm glad I did, because everyone in my family loves them! I am not normally a fan of Pop Tarts, because I find them to be too sweet.  And I was very leary of these, thinking they would also be way too sweet for me to enjoy.  However, upon trying one, I find these flavored pop tarts to be very mild in the sweetness category.  The icing on the top is good and light (I do wish they would not put as much icing on them though!), and the inside tastes just like a pumpkin pie, and believe it or not, isn't that sweet at all!  So you get a pumpkin pie inside and then a little sweet treat on the outside.  My 1yr old loves these things and I can't blame her!  We'll be sad to see them leave when their limited time is over, but will look forward to next year when hopefully they'll return!

They came in the same shipment as another pumpkin-flavored product, Carbon's Golden Malted pancake and waffle mix, that I had ordered.<br /><br />The waffles were and are wonderful!  The Pop-tarts tasted dry and stale.  The frosting kind of cracks off and there is not much filling.  The filling does not taste like pumpkin!  It tastes sugary but, not particularly like anything else.  I opened two different packets and had the same result.  They were bad.  I tasted them and ended up throwing them out.  I tried one plain out of the package and I tried toasting the other.  It didn't make any difference.  What a waste of time and money!

review/summary: Pumpkin Pie????
review/text: I'm obsessed with pumpkin pie. I can have it any day at any time of the day. When I saw these pop tarts I thought, "whoa, pumpkin pie in a pop tart? No way. This has to taste really good." But to my surprise, it wasn't as great as I thought it would. Too sweet. I'm sure because of the frost on top. But, it killed the taste for me.

review/summary: Awsome Pop Tarts
review/text: I hadn't had Pop Tarts for years, but then I happened to run across this listing and figured I'd try them.  They're just plane awsome.  I mean, as Pop Tarts go, they are anyway.  Afterall, they're not particularly healthy, and they do have lots of sugar.  But, I remember eating various flavors of these quite often when I was a kid, so they have definately the nostalgia factor going for them.  They nailed the pumpkin taste, so I'm giving 5 stars and placing an order for more.

review/summary: The Holidays Mean Pumpkin Pop Tarts
review/text: One of the things I look forward to during the Holiday Season is Pumpkin Pop Tarts: I love them and the only place I have ever seen them is on Amazon. So every year, I wait for my Amazon Fix of Pumpkin Pop Tarts.<br />I admit to being a Poptart junkie with my all time, year long favorite being FROSTED BROWN SUGAR CINNAMON poptarts.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M2UNI0">Pop-Tarts, Frosted Brown Sugar Cinnamon, 16-Count Tarts (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />But OH, how I await the PUMPKIN PIE pop tarts. That soft , velvety pumkin taste and feel is mixed right in to these pastries and for about six weeks at holiday time, I immerse myself in the sweet, gooey, pumpkiney flavor. These Tarts are SO FRESH. No cooking necessary, BUT, oh, the wonderful smells and tastes if you do!<br />It is a snack made in Heaven for us to use as one of the seven deadlies and eat to our heart's content. Buy them when they first arrive on line and they are still so fresh the pumpkin filling drips from between the two pastries. The colorful topping lends to the visual and gustatory thrill.<br /><br />Do, indeed, splurge and get some of these for yourself. But do not get too many; be sure to leave some for me!<br /><br />I tried another Seasonal Poptart product this Year: The Gingerbread PopTarts. Although they were also nice and fresh, I did not care for them at all. To me they did not taste like Gingerbread a bit!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HNA5SY">Kellogg's Pop-Tarts Printed Fun - Gingerbread (Limited Edition) - 12 Pastries, 21.1-oz. Box</a><br /><br />So I suggest you stick with Pumpkin Pie and, you too, may have a new Tradition for the Holidays!

review/text: These really are the best Pop Tarts ever and should NOT be limited edition. I've called/been to every store in a 30 mile radius and can not find them. Shame on Amazon for charging $15 box (and Kellogg's for letting them)! Even when not on sale they're no more than $5 at the store. I've got friends across the country looking for some to send me. If I don't find some at a reasonable price I just might have to give up on Pop Tarts :(

I don't consider $15 for a disappointing novelty a tragedy by any means.

My box was in good condition, but my tarts had been experiencing some rapidly changing g-forces. Need more packing to act as an inertial damper to maintain structural integrity. :D

review/text: So Im a pop-tart lover, and the limited "seasonal" editions, are my favorite flavors. So ofcourse I love these Pumkin Pie flavored pop-tarts, but they do NOT taste like Pumkin Pie. One review said its like eating pumpkin pie, to me thats an over statement. They are yummy(delicious seriously),& yes pumpkin is actually listed in the ingredients, but these taste exactly like what they are Pumpkin flavored pop-tarts.<br /><br />However these are far to expensive online, Ive recently bought a 12 pck, which is only 6 servings (2 pastries to a wrapper)for 2.69$ i'd suggest buying from the grocery store, inless buying online is your last option :)

A little more pumpkin (or whatever that is) and less frosting and they would be perfect.

It does, in fact, contain xylitol...but all the other terrible stuff as well, including aspartame.  I think that the item listing is misleading, or they have changed the formulation of this gum.  I'm disappointed that I could have purchased chemical gum at any local store.  Seller should make sure that the listing accurately describes the ingredients.  It has a good taste, and I will use it rather than spend the money to send it back, but it's not what I was looking for. I will stick with SPRY gum from now on.<br /><br />The seller did ship very quickly.

At first, I was skeptical that I would love any gum as much as I loved Trident Freshmint, but I quickly became hooked on the Minty Sweet Twist. It kind of reminds me of the flavor of those chalky white and/or pastel pillow mints they serve at restaurants and weddings/baby showers. I chew several pieces of this gum a day, and buying it in bulk from Amazon saves me a bunch of money!

review/text: My wife is Indian and loves Chai tea, but we're busy people and it takes a long time to make it properly. She has tried the following:<br /><br />  1. Starbucks Chai Latte (from Starbucks)<br />  2. Starbucks Chai (concentrate, the cardboard box with the syrup in it)<br />  3. Trader Joe's Spiced Chai (powder)<br />  4. Oregon Chai (powder and liquid)<br />  5. Some other Chai powder that Costco had a few years ago but I don't remember the name now.<br /><br />Except for #1 (which is crazy expensive at >$[...] a cup), the rest have been lackluster. But then she found Twinings Indian Spiced Chai Tea which is exactly what she was looking for, but you can't find it in every grocery store.<br /><br />Follow the instructions (1/4 cup milk, 3/4 cup water, 2 tsp sugar, tea bag) and you'll make a perfect cup every time, at like 1/20th the price of Starbucks.<br /><br />UPDATE: Now that they have changed the product from "Indian Spiced Chai" to just "Chai", it is nowhere as good.  I have to reduce my 5 star rating to 3.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: Here's her new favorite: Yogi Chai Rooibos, also available from Amazon.

review/summary: Not chai, and not very good either...
review/text: I have a love/hate relationship with Twinings teas. Unfortunately, the two I love best have been discontinued (Vanilla Black Tea and Indian Spiced Chai Tea). Since this tea claims to combine vanilla and chai, I decided to try it.<br /><br />It is remarkably bland and frankly, the chai spices are barely perceptible, whereas the vanilla taste is non-existent. It is not a particularly potent tea either. I also agree that there is an odd, slightly fishy taste to this tea. I will finish the box (I started putting cinnamon sticks in it to give it some flavor), but this was a real miscalculation on Twinings' part. I wrote them about it and they didn't even bother to reply. My guess is I am not the only one disappointed by this tea, and since it isn't exactly cheap, my advice would be to look elsewhere if you want chai tea.

I am now stuck with these boxes and had to travel 2 hrs to get what I wanted. By the way, I have ordered this before with no problem. NOT HAPPY at all as I wasted my money and Amazon does not refund for this type of product. Maybe they could send me a coupon torward a different purchase.<br />N

review/text: I have only recently discovered a love for Chai Tea but it could be only a certain brand. I really enjoy the Celestial Seasonings brand Chai which has more body and well-blended flavor. This had such a strong cinnamon flavor and it was more the oil-type not the cinnamon stick type. None of the other flavors stood out at all to me. I really like cinnamon but it reminded me of the cinnamon toothpicks we made when I was a kid. I haven't had much experience with other types of Chai so I can't much of a comparison.

review/text: I'm half way through my first box of this Twinings tea.  I've lived in India and, when having had access to a kitchen, have made my own from scratch using the same ingredients as in this tea bag (I added a little black pepper).  Twinings tea is a good substitute to scratch.  I make this tea in a 20-oz mug and let the bag steep for at five minutes (longer is better) to get the full flavor (I usually steep tea bags for only a minute or two).<br /><br />Unlike an earlier reviewer, I don't get any mint taste (the box ingredient list is:  tea, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and ginger).  I drink this tea with about 1/4 cup whole milk, 2 teaspoons xylitol, and 1 teaspoon of white stevia powder extract.  Yummy!<br /><br />I'd give this product five stars if it were organic.

review/summary: Good taste but weak tea
review/text: The teabag has all the ingredients to make a good tasting tea..but the tea itself is ~very weak~. so I am not buying this anymore.<br />just buy regular tea and add the following to it<br />Cardamom<br />Cloves<br />Black peppercorn<br />Saunf (fennel seeds)<br /><br />and it will taste much better.

review/summary: Weak
review/text: I love chai. I used to buy loose leaf chai from a place online. They don't sell the same chai anymore and are always out of stock it seems so i'm looking for another source, hoping for more local, dependsble stock and cheaper. I tried Twinnings chai and Stash chai, the only two i found at the grocery store. Both were very very disappointing. I guess you get what you pay for. I found Twinnings chai to be weak, so weak! I steeped it longer to see if that helped and it didn't. Also, it had a strong apple taste. In fact the first thing I moticed when i opened the box was an apple smell. So much so that i thought i bought the wrong tea! I read and reread the box, all sides, and, no, I bought regular chai. I did see on the box that Twinnings makes a apple spice chai, so I AGAIN read the box to make absolutely sure I didn't buy the wrong tea. I did not. The box just says chai. I honestly wonder if they put the wrong tea in this box because sitting here writing this i still taste apples. Overall, i find this tea so weak as to be unperceptable when mixed with cream, with only a faint but persistant apple aftertaste. Truly underwhelming. What a disappointment. At least i bought at the store first rather than buying from Amazon.

review/summary: Weak, flavorless Chai
review/text: I never tried the previous incarnation of this tea, "Indian Spiced Chai," so I can't speak to the difference between the two but the new version is weak, bland, and flavorless compared to authentic Chai.  I usually steer clear of tea bags and mass produced super market tea brands but thought I would give this a try since it was the only decaffeinated Chai in the store.  I will not bother going into detail on the subpar quality of this tea.  Simply stated, if you are a serious tea drinker and can taste the difference between quality and low grade tea, you will not enjoy this tea.

review/summary: WAY too much cardamom!
review/text: I used to drink Twinings India Spice Chai in the gold box daily and with great pleasure. It was so much better than Tazo (all ginger and vanilla) and the other supermarket brands (all cinnamon). Before I found it on Amazon I could only get it at the CostPlus/World Market, but happily made the trip. It was often sold out but STILL worth trying for.<br /><br />Then Twinings decided to change their recipe. I think in an attempt to taste more like Tazo, they took out all the subtle masala chai flavors and just dumped in a ridiculous amount of cardamom. It's literally enough to make your tongue a little numb and kills all the background flavors.<br /><br />The positive thing I can say is that it's still super cheap and convenient on Amazon Subscribe. And if you don't care about subtleties in flavor, the overload of cardamom eventually seems to kill those taste buds and it becomes less oppressive over time.  Not good, but less horrible.<br /><br />What was once a wonderful and satisfying tea experience now just gets the job done, but at the expense of all the joy :(

review/summary: Not the same Chai
review/text: The Twining's Chai became their replacement of the Twining's Indian Spiced Chai which stopped in production in June 2009.<br /><br />Chai became a sad replacement.<br /><br />It's difficult to find a Chai tea without anise seed (of which I'm allergic) but still have a good blend of spices and tea that encourages it's consumption.  This is NOT that tea.

review/summary: Not bad, but not the best chai
review/text: I'm a total chai tea freak, so when I see a chai tea that I haven't tried yet I pick it up.<br /><br />Twinings isn't bad at all, but there's just not enough "chai" in the tea.  It's basically a black tea with the barest hint of chai spice.

review/summary: A nice change of pace.
review/text: This is by no means a strong tea, it was not meant to be.  The flavor is great.  I normally make my tea from scratch but have these around when I am on the run.  The price is very reasonable and I will certainly be purchasing more.  For something a bit different, I certainly recommend you give this tea a  try.

review/summary: Best Instant Chai - Ever!
review/text: This is the best chai that you can buy without going to an expensive coffeehouse and spending $4 on a cup - it rocks.  Add some brown sugar and milk and you've got a truly delicious tea.  Try it and I'm sure you'll agree!  8)

review/summary: Something Special
review/text: I was looking for the India Spice Chai Tea by Twinings which I believe has been discontinued, when I found this tea.  The spices are not overpowering and when made with a little sugar and cream it really brings out the full flavors.  I have shared this tea with a couple of friends and they all commented on how much they really liked it.

review/summary: Great balanced taste!
review/text: I love this Chai tea because it is well balanced and not too spicy. I drink this every morning and my day is not complete without it...of course, drink it with a little milk or half & half.
