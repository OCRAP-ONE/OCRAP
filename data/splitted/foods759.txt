review/summary: Still the best!
review/text: For bottled tea, the Original Sweet Tea is the best I have found so far.  It has a very good, fresh tea flavor and nice tea smell.  Nothing funky, just tea, sugar and water.  Organic if that matters to you.  This tea is the only one that actually tastes like homemade tea (that I have found so far).  It's a bit expensive, but very good.<br /><br />My current favorite, for sure.<br /><br />9-28-2011 Update:  Have now consumed several cases and this is still the best.  Tastes like the tea my mother used to make. ;)<br /><br />11-24-2011 Update:  I continue to enjoy this very fine tea.  Panicked when Amazon was out of stock for awhile, as it's hard to find locally.  Good news is the price actually has dropped - woo hoo!

review/text: My husband and I tried this tea when visiting family in Florida.  This was probably the best sweet tea that I've tried that was both sweet enough for my husband yet not overly sweet to me.  It had a pure taste to it without any acidic aftertaste from citrus or chemicals which I find with other bottled sweet teas that even state "sweetened - no lemon".<br /><br />After about a year, this is slowly making its way to the grocery chains in Arizona and mainly found in the "organic food" aisles, but they only carry the smaller 20oz(?) bottles instead of the 64oz bottles.  Therefore, Amazon is still my "go-to" location to purchase this in bulk in the size I prefer.

review/summary: Tasty & convenient but  at $3.21 a package, not the best value available
review/text: Daverat's Wife speaking:  I made this for my husband and it was very easy to prepare in the microwave.  He enjoyed the meal and stated that he'd love to have them on hand if the price point was more reasonable.  He ate his  Fusilla & Veg Marinara with a large salad seasoned only with some balsamic vingar and had it for his dinner meal.  To use the Chinese food cliche, he told me an hour later he was hungry again so I made him a grilled chicken breast.  That got me to thinking that the packaged meal alone wouldn't work for us as a stand-alone  meal.  We'd have to add to it for it to work.  If these were a dollar per package cheaper after Subscribe & Save, they might make a good shelf stable meal to which you could add cooked chicken strips, canned chicken, black beans or even a high quality pouched tuna.  On it's own, it's not filling enough nor nutritionally complete.<br /><br />Right at this moment, Amazon is showing me an offer for a $5 off Amazon coupon which when applied, brings the price point after Subscribe & Save down to $2.38, which is  quite a bit better and rather tempting.  However, after seeing this, I asked my husband if he wanted me to order some for the pantry and suddenly he wasn't as in love with the product any more.  Oh well!  When you add in the cost of a small salad plus some lean protein such as the gilled chicken breast, even with the $5 off, it brings the per meal cost back up to around $4.60.  That may sound like a bargain if you eat out often or grab fast food a few nights a week but we don't.  I plan our meals out for the week and even sometimes for an entire month ahead of time to get the most from every grocery item we buy and I could make this same dish using Barilla High protein pasta, my own vegetable marinara with veg from my gardens and come out quite a bit cheaper.  I also think I could eliminate some of the high sodium contant and bring down the fat in the dish as well.<br /><br />I gave it four stars, however, because hubby liked it, it was simple to prepare and even a starving teenager can toss in some chicken strips of canned chicken to make it a more filling meal.  There's enough sauce in the meal to coat a moderate amount of added chicken or meat.  I could see this being a good pantry staple for a college student or a busy single person. As shelf-stable meals go, even though I wasn't all that impressed with the sodium count and fat, this brand compares quite favorable with other shelf-stable meals. It could be a good choice for folks in ned of something o brag and nuke quickly at the end of a long day and in place of ordering in restaurant food.  For a family on a budget.. not so much of a deal.

review/summary: Tasty Whole Grain Fusilli with Veggie Marinara in 60 Seconds!
review/text: Whole Grain Fusilli with Veggie Marinara microwaved in 60 seconds is al dente pasta and tasty marinara, so yummy and quick! Discernible pieces of tomato, zucchini, bell pepper, carrots, onion and eggplant make a tasty Marinara sauce. It's neither too sweet nor acidic, just right for my personal preference. But it made me crave sausage and/or meatballs lol. The 60 second microwave time delivers firmer, al dente, 51% Whole Wheat Fusilli. Add a teaspoon of water and another 30 seconds in the microwave delivers a softer pasta. Only 320 calories for the 9 oz serving!<br /><br />The 2-stage plastic film venting and removal is a bit tricky. The unique packaging separates the pourable sauce cup from the pasta so it doesn't get soggy/squishy while cooking. Follow the directions AND steady the container or be prepared to clean spilled sauce.  This item is not something I'd just put on the pantry shelf without explaining the cooking process to my non-instruction-reading offspring.<br /><br />Really disappointed Amazon Prime doesn't currently have this in stock; I'd order it for my lunch/dinner this week. The current available offerings are cost prohibative...it's really good but not worth $40-ish expenditure!

The whole grain fusilli cooked to al dente tenderness following the instructions and the chunky marinara sauce is so good that I wished there was more of it.  Rarely do I eat sauce alone but this sauce is good enough to.

review/text: Love the idea of ready in a minute pasta and for that alone this product gets praise.  The pasta is whole grain so that's a big plus and it actually comes out al dente.  The vegetable marinara sauce is tasty, but has a high salt content - 710mg for a 9 oz. serving.<br /><br />It looks like much thought and testing went into creating the packaging, but I found it challenging.  You need to pull back the film to expose the sauce tray -- and not spill it.  I had to pull hard on the film, which made the sauce cup wiggle.  Easy to work around, but tricky nonetheless.<br /><br />All in all a step up from usual microwave in a minute fare.

review/text: Barilla Whole Grain Fusilli with Vegetable Marinara Sauce is very good.  It needs no refrigeration, so you can toss it into your kitchen cabinet, your desk at work or leave it in your briefcase.  It's quick to fix - only taking ONE MINUTE to heat in the microwave, you'll be eating before you know it.  And it's quite tasty!  Not something you just nuke and scarf to fill your belly.  The 9 ounce size is filling, but you can add a salad and bread if you're really hungry.  The pasta has a nice al dente chew to it and the sauce is really flavorful.  I love that this meal is only 320 calories and made with healthier whole grain pasta.  I will definitely buy these to keep on hand when I need something quick and tasty!

review/summary: Saucy with nice pasta
review/text: I give this 5 stars if you like the taste of whole grain pasta... whole grain pasta has a pretty strong, distinctive flavor if you're used to regular ol' non-whole-grain pasta, and that flavor isn't hidden by this sauce.  If you already know that you don't like the taste of whole grain pasta, these meals aren't for you.  I'm a picky eater so I couldn't really get past the whole grain pasta, but my husband ended up eating all of it and he really liked it.<br /><br />This cooked quickly (which is great on lunch break!) and the sauce and the pasta cook separately, then you mix them together when they're hot.  I like this preparation, as it kept the pasta from getting gummy.  The pasta was nicely done, slightly chewy, and the sauce was good and there's plenty of it (other reviewers have said that there wasn't enough sauce, but that wasn't the case for me, and I like it saucy).<br /><br />This isn't really the most economical pasta & sauce lunch option, I'm sure getting a pound of pasta, cooking it, and adding a jar or two of pasta sauce would be cheaper, but these Barilla meals are about convenience.  I'll buy a few of them and have my husband take them to work to keep in his desk, for those days when he forgets to grab his lunch bag from the kitchen counter on his way out the door in the morning.

review/summary: Take your own pasta
review/text: I tried this for lunch at work once, and I regretted not bringing something else. The sauce is great, it doesn't taste like a ton of preservatives nor does it leave an aftertaste like these kinds of sauces often do. The real problem is the pasta. It tastes, to put it bluntly, like cardboard. I've had whole grain many times before, and I know it doesn't normally taste like that. I wasn't so disgusted that I couldn't eat it, but the whole time I wished I had something else.<br /><br />The serving size was an additional problem. Maybe good for a really light lunch when you're home, but no good when you've been at work and you'd like something to satisfy you. When I finished this I had to run out to buy something else because I was still pretty hungry. It felt like I had a snack more than anything.

review/text: First off, I guess I didn't catch that this was whole grain - I don't much care for whole grain pasta, though this is no worse than any OTHER whole grain pasta.  That pretty much spoiled the whole thing for me. The packaging is clever and convenient, and the heat was perfect for eating IMMEDIATELY after microwaving (I mean, after completing the microwaving and mixing in the sauce.)<br /><br />The big problem for me was that it is pretty light on the marinara sauce - there's just enough to flavor all the fuselli - which might be ok if you like the taste of whole-grain pasta - but as aforesaid, I don't!  I thought the FLAVOR of the sauce was OK, and if there had been enough to drown the flavor of the pasta, I'd have no complaints!

review/text: In an era of "quick and easy-to-prepare" food, the microwave is a time saver but one must take care what to buy. Is it tasty? Is it easy to heat? Barilla's whole grain fusili with vegetable marinara sauce meets the needs of the "on the run" pasta lover. No cholesterol, a dab of sodium (710 mg), this microwave chewy,  "al dente" fusilli has a snappy marinara sauce which makes it a fine purchase for the solo eater. One caution: be careful with the nifty container when removing its plastic covering, the pull back disguises a small white tray for the sauce which can tip and spill. Heed the instructions. Otherwise, this is a fine nutritious meal for the solo eater. I intend to buy more.

review/summary: Tasty, high fiber, vegetarian convenience food
review/text: As long as you enjoy the dense heartiness of whole grain pasta--I prefer it--this is delicious. It has a whopping 11 grams of fiber, that's 44% of the Daily Value, which is partially achieved by the addition of oat fiber so it should be a good choice for people who want to lower their cholesterol. The field for tasty, healthful,  vegetarian convenience foods is pretty sparse, so this is a welcome addition. Besides all the fiber, it's got 10 grams of protein, but with no legumes or dairy that protein isn't complete and you may want to add something with complementary amino acids to your meal. The calorie total is 320, so  that something extra shouldn't wreck a diet.<br /><br />Because it's manufactured on equipment that processes food with eggs, vegans and people with an egg allergy may want to avoid this product. One negative is that the sodium is a little higher than I like to eat in a meal, 710mg, but for a prepared food that's not bad. Also, the film covering the tray was difficult for the starting-to-age joints in my hand to pull back so I had to enlist my boyfriend. It's a slightly tricky move too, because you are at risk of jolting the sauce out of its tray and onto the counter or floor, but I'm sure people with average dexterity will have no problem.

review/summary: Better than the regular Barilla pasta bowls
review/text: I've actually been eating these Barilla pasta bowls for a while. Yet, it wasn't until this Amazone Vine offering that I realized that these convenient lunches came in whole grain since my local grocery store does not carry them for some reason.<br /><br />These pasta bowls aren't by any means amazing, but they aren't bad for something you can just pop in the microwave for a minute and have lunch. It's perfectly portable for work, easy to make, better than many of the other microwaveable lunches I've had and -the best part -it doesn't require the freezer or refrigerator. And the whole grain pasta is considerably better than the regular pasta. The marinara sauce isn't bad either, and it actually has small pieces of veggies in it.<br /><br />The only problem I have with these bowls is that they just don't fill me up. I'm a small person, and I don't even eat a lot, but I could easily down two of these in one sitting without a problem. This bothers me because every other microwaveable lunch I've tried can fill me up without having to pack other lunch items. I guess this can be something of a personal preference, but I would rather just throw the pasta bowl in my bag and go instead of having to pack other items.

review/text: This is the second of these Barilla microwaveable pasta dishes I've tried, and I enjoyed it as much as the other (the penne with tomato and basil sauce).<br /><br />You store these meals at room temperature, yet they taste as good as any premium frozen pasta entrees I've ever tried.<br /><br />In addition, the manufacturer claims to use NO artificial ingredients or preservatives.<br /><br />I'm not sure what alchemy makes all this happen, but one secret of the superior flavor and texture of these pasta dishes lies in the packaging: the plastic pasta tray has a removeable "sub-tray" in the corner that holds the sauce separate from the pasta.<br /><br />This enables the pasta to remain al dente.<br /><br />Heating these dishes is very fast and easy as well.  Just peel back a corner of the cover to vent the sauce and pop the dish in the microwave for sixty seconds.<br /><br />I'm also impressed to see that at Amazon's prices, these dishes aren't horribly exorbitant either.  More expensive than Chef Boyardee in a can, but probably a bit less than a frozen entree.<br /><br />My only quibble is I really wouldn't call one of these dishes a "meal."  The portion size is nominally 9 ounces, but I would consider this a light lunch at best -- and I would probably be starving by tea time.<br /><br />Nevertheless for pasta fans looking for a quick and delicious pasta fix, these Barilla dishes are definitely worth trying.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Great taste and texture.<br />* Fast and easy to prepare.<br />* Store at room temperature; no need to use up valuable freezer space.<br />* All natural ingredients with NO preservatives.<br />* Reasonably priced for the quality and convenience.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Portion a bit skimpy for a meal.<br />* One must wonder if chemicals from the plastic cooking trays will leech into the food.

review/summary: OK, but NOT that easy to prepare.
review/text: I really like pasta, so I'm probably not a good judge of what's "good" in pasta - I like it all.  That said, I liked this product as far as the food, the taste, etc. goes.  However, I have to say that I really prefer the packaged pasta dishes that Hormel puts out.  With the Hormel products everything in the package is already together.  All you have to do is throw them in the microwave for a bit and you're done - and flavor/product-wise the Hormel packages are just as good as this.  So, in a nutshell - while I liked this product, I really like the Hormel pastas better and will probably stick with those in the future.

review/summary: Not a Wheat Pasta Fan
review/text: Of the different varieties I tried of these Barilla pasta meals, this was just okay.  The wheat pasta was a bit mushy and I didn't like the texture/taste.  My sister and niece (who I was sharing this with) agreed that the pasta could have been a little more al dente, but they liked the pasta and thought this was better than the other ones we tried.  We all liked the sauce - sweet with chunks of vegetables.<br /><br />Overall, the one minute in the microwave was plenty of time - meal was hot enough.  The top - a sealed piece of plastic that you peel off over the sauce to cook then fully remove to pour the sauce over the pasta - is a bit difficult to remove.  I slopped some sauce trying to get it off so if you're making these at work, be careful.<br /><br />Calorie wise, this was just over 300 calories and had 11 grams of fiber.  The portion is very generous (I thought...) and the sodium content, while not low, isn't too bad (around 700 mg).  Though I would not buy this flavor again, I will buy some of the others.

review/summary: Convenient but odiferous
review/text: The ease of preparation for BARILLA's fusilli w/veggy marinara is more than offset by aroma and taste.<br /><br />To prepare, a corner of the top seal is lifted to vent a sauce tray. Nuked for a minute, everything's hot.<br /><br />When you peel back the rest of the cover you're hit with an unsavory odor, can't call it an aroma, that doesn't stimulate the appetite.<br /><br />Lift the sauce tray out, spoon the gravy over the pasta, and there isn't enough to cover all. eh<br /><br />The first bite reveals that the smell you immediately noticed is part of the food's taste. This stuff's edible, but only if there isn't something else available.<br /><br />NUTRITION FACTS: 50 of the 9 oz. serving's 320 calories derive from fat, mostly saturated. It's a good source of fiber (44% RDA) has 57 grams of carbs, a zero cholesterol rating (despite saturated fats), and is high in sodium (710 mg, or 30% of RDA). One serving provides 25% of your Vitamin A needs, 15% of iron, 6% of calcium.<br /><br />And yet, after my free Vine serving, I would never buy BARILLA's nukeable pasta and wouldn't eat it again if comped in advance.

review/summary: Best Old-Fashioned Oatmeal Ever!
review/text: I do not know why this oatmeal is better than any other I have ever had. It looks and seems just like the others, but it ends up with this perfect texture, on the stovetop or following the directions on back for the microwave. I love oatmeal, as does my family, and we have tried many brands over the years. This kind is by far the best, IMO. My 9 year old daughter agrees. Won't even eat, for example, Publix's old fashioned organic oatmeal, which turns out too mushy for our tastes. My 70 yr old aunt also loves oatmeal and this is the only brand she has found that does not cause her indigestion (don't know why!) Regarding the weevils comment by another reviewer, the comment kept me from purchasing this from Amazon for a while. But, I did order it from them months ago. Went through the entire 12 boxes without a single weevil. Also, it was totally fresh, just as if bought from Whole Foods, but for less money. I highly recommend this delicious oatmeal.

review/text: Authentic and flavorful. Just mix with yogurt, EVOO, and a little vinegar. Let chicken marinate in this mixture at least an hour and then pop chicken on grill or in a 500 degree oven until done.  That's it. Final product is not bright red like many tandooris, but there is no artificial red color in it like in many other tandoori preparations.

review/summary: Restaurant Quality Taste
review/text: We love Tandoori Chicken with Basmati Rice. This seasoning mix is so perfect and allows us to enjoy a Restaurant Quality meal at home.<br /><br />Since we don't have a Tandoor Oven, we cook the skewers of chicken on our gas BBQ (at very high heat) with the lid closed. (We often use boneless/skinless breasts, cut into large chunks.)<br /><br />We use the left over marinade to baste the chicken twice (once when first placed on the BBQ and then when turned the first time). Just remember that the marinade was originally soaking in raw chicken. So, to make sure any harmful bacteria are killed, baste early and then let the high heat do its job.<br /><br />When cooking for just the two of us, we cut the marinade recipe in half and only use half of the seasoning packet.<br /><br />Enjoy

review/summary: Easy to make - Great reviews from guests
review/text: One Saturday I was watching Aarti Sequeira's show on Food Network on Tandoori Chicken. It looked great and her guests loved it.  The only problem for me was getting ALL of the various spices, measuring them and putting it together.<br /><br />I found this product on Amazon and it has a few very good reviews. Since I wanted to cook something different for my guests, I gave it a try.<br /><br />First, it was super easy!  Yogurt and the Arora Creations Tandoori Chicken spice packets was all it took.  I did a double batch. Total prep time was under 20 minutes. I let it marinate five hours. I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs.  On a hot BBQ prepared with lump hardwood charcoal (not briquettes), I cooked each side for about 3 minutes. It had a wonderful char.<br /><br />On the same grill I cooked Naan bread. The bread, tandoori chicken and a light potato salad was a huge hit.  We have guests coming over this month. Two of them were here for the tandoori chicken. They told the rest of folks coming and begged me to make it again.<br /><br />Yes, you can buy all the tandoori spices and measure them out, but why? This is easy and delicious.

Prepare it with Naan found on the allrecipes.com website and you'll have yourself a wonderful meal. Now we just need to find some mint chutney for the naan and mulligatawny (sp?)!<br />I recommend this whole-heartedly!

review/text: Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!

review/summary: A Good Ginger Chew, If You Like Peanut Butter.
review/text: The Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market nearby has a variety of gourmet candies and I enjoy trying them. Many, if not most, are imported. One of the types they have are three different kinds of Chimes Ginger Chews. I tried two of the kinds and enjoyed them very much The third was a Peanut Butter Ginger Chew. Somehow, the idea of ginger mixed with peanut butter just wasn't all that attractive to me. Finally, I got around to trying them and purchased a 1,5-ounce bag. Well, they're a good candy, but I'll go along with my instincts and say that they aren't as good as the other two varieties. However, like the others, they have a nice gingery taste, here subordinated by the peanut butter, they're nice and chewy and they're not overly sweet, It's a good candy, and if you like peanut butter you might really enjoy the chews.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I served this as a main staple coffee in my shop and had nothing but rave reviews. This is my personal favorite of well over 100 higher end coffee blends I have tried. Having visited the roaster in Seattle and trained in their method of brewing, I find that it is one of the best companies out there roasting finer coffees and espressos.<br /><br />You can order directly from them at their own web site for a more fresh package, and get varied sizes from thermo-pot brewer packs to 5lb bags and ground or whole bean.  To me, this is my favorite coffee out there.

review/summary: When people say Seattle has great coffee - this is what they're talking about
review/text: Take it from a Seattleite - Meaning of Life is the best drip coffee you'll find for the price.  This is the roast that got me started on coffee - I was never a coffee fan growing up because my mom always drank the cheap Folgers and Maxwell House swill.  If you want a coffee that isn't bitter, wakes you up in the morning, and is smooth, you will not find anything better.  Some from the Pacific Northwest will argue that Caffe Vita is better but I find their blends to be bitter and less smooth than Caffe D'arte's.<br /><br />I honestly cannot believe how cheap it is here per pound compared to the major players - Dunkin, Starbucks, Peet's, etc.  It is a steal at the auto renewal price - it sells for several dollars more at their downtown Seattle cafe.  Given that I live on the Eastside, saving a trip and paying the lower price through Amazon is a no brainer.

review/summary: MOST AMAZING DRIP COFFEE THAT TASTES AS GOOD AS ESPRESSO!
review/text: I have loved Starbucks, but didn't like the acid stomach later in the day.  Plus, starbucks price is too high for everyday.<br /><br />so when I discovered "Meaing of Life", I was floored!  Wonderful full-bodied taste, without the acid burn, and no later stomach issues.<br /><br />So, price is better, flavor wonderful competition to Starbucks, and better on my body.  I love it.<br /><br />Can't wait to share it with all my friends!<br /><br />gabrielle

review/summary: Taste like Starbucks, French Roast
review/text: I do not like the more rancid, sat on a coffee burner all day taste that I think Starbucks has.  Some people do like that taste, so I would recommend this coffee for those who do like Starbucks.  This is similar to the darker French and Italian roasted beans as well.  I gave three stars in consideration that this taste may just be a preference.

review/summary: More beans than I know what to do with.
review/text: I bought this on impulse, the moment I came across it on Amazon-- I had been shopping for Jelly Bellies after not being satisfied with the pricing of bulk beans from brick and mortar/warehouse stores. 10 pounds of beans for $65?  One click and several months later and here I am.  I've had these for months and I've hardly put a dent into them.  I've had to resort to finding creative things to do with them-- like putting handfuls into individual baggies and hiding them throughout the house so I can have "surprise jelly beans" when I'm not expecting it.<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off a star in this review is because these beans literally come in just a cardboard box.  No plastic bag holding the beans, just a bunch of beans sitting in and against cardboard.  There were some small exposed seams and I did have some concern if the beans could be exposed to creepy crawlies. A one cent bag to protect the beans while they are in the box would be appreciated.

review/text: I was a little worried when I unpacked this coffee and noticed the "Extra Bold" on the box.  However, this coffee is very smooth, with no bitter taste to it...and it is also not weak like some breakfast blend coffees can be.  This coffee is for my wife, who doesn't like some of the bolder coffee's I drink. (Timothy's Parisian Nights, Coffee People Black Tiger, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, Starbucks Cafe Verona and Sumatra)  This is more like Caribou Blend or some of the lighter "Donut House" coffees.  I tried a cup and I know it'll be right up her alley.

review/text: I like my coffee in the mild range - and this fits the bill.  I had been drinking nothing but Green Mountain Breakfast Blend, and while I would say I prefer that variety a little better in terms of taste, these Tully's are very similar.  And given the ridiculous price of most K-cups - Green Mountain included - I will stick with the Tully's for now.  The only thing I didn't really like is that the 50 K-cups were thrown in to the shipping box loosely, with no additional packing material.  Even something like a plastic bag to seal them up inside the shipping box would have been nice.

I've only seen it on Amazon, and ordered it in search of a favorite.  Strong enough that it has flavor.  Not so strong so that you think you drank a charred tire.  No extra flavors either like some others.  I'd categorize this as a medium to light roast.  It is a just a little lighter than the Tulley's House blend.

review/summary: Problem brewing
review/text: I liked the taste of this coffee but there was a problem with some of the K-cups of this brand.  Probably a half-a-dozen of this brand of K-cups did not work properly.  I would put the K-cup in the coffeemaker, close the lid on the Keurig, and press the button of the size cup I wanted to brew and it would brew about 3 Tablespoons of coffee and then stop.  Coffee grounds would be in the cup and I would open the Keurig and close the lid and try again and it just would not brew.  I tried another K-cup of this same brand and it did the same thing.  Finally I just put in a Timothy's brand K-cup and it worked just fine.  This kept happening using the Tully's K-cup- so far I've wasted six of them.  Some of them worked just fine.  It might have just been a fluke with this box of Tully's K-cups but I probably will not order this kind again.  The K-cups are too expensive to waste 1/4 of them.

review/summary: I love Ghirardelli!
review/text: I was so happy to see that Ghirardelli syrup is available in a smaller size. I used to have to buy the large bottles but didn't use enough and ended up wasting it. This syrup tastes soooo good! I use it in coffee to make my own mocha and in chocolate martinis. I highly recommend it for when you need a quality tasting chocolate syrup!

review/summary: Great Taste
review/text: Great tasting, rich flavor, perfect for making a nice hot cup of Mocha. I bought this to test it against Hershey's syrup for my Mocha and there is an incredible distinct taste difference that is noticeable. This is much richer and tastes more like chocolate, and less sugary then Hershey's syrup.

review/summary: Busybone Chewnola
review/text: My dogs love this treat better than any other--and they get plenty!  Since they're German Shepards, most chewy treats don't last too long--this lasts longer than any other.

review/summary: Busy Bones
review/text: I started buying Busy Bones for my dog when he was a puppy in 2009.  I liked the fact that this product was completely digestible and it truly satisfied his chewing needs.  Then all of a sudden I could find them nowhere!  I decided to try Amazon and found them being sold at a better price, and now I can even have them automatically sent about every three or four months.  I feed them to him about every other day and he still loves them and they're good for his teeth.  It is also very convenient that I can rely on their availability through Amazon and don't have to search them out at various stores.<br />Amazon Verified Purchase
