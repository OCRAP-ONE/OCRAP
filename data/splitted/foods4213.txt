review/summary: Not quite what I was hoping for
review/text: I purchased this granola because of the great reviews it had.  I'll eat it, but it doesn't taste anywhere near as good as the reviews suggest.  I wasn't able to try it before ordering, because stores in my area do not carry it.  For me, the chocolate flavor is lacking while the coconut flavor is overpowering.  If you really like coconut with a light chocolate taste, then you will probably really like this granola.  I love chocolate, so I was just hoping for more.<br /><br />Also, I would not order this with other items, because my order took forever to get delivered (almost 3 weeks).  I almost always receive my Amazon.com orders very quickly, so I'm thinking this item caused the delay.

review/summary: This cereal is so good I order it on-line just to make sure I can get it!
review/text: I do double check which vendor is shipping/how many boxes are included.  Sometimes these factors change as does the pricing structure depending on which vendor is selling via Amazon.<br /><br />I'm currently living in an area where my favorite US foods can be challenging to get and I have to pick and choose which ones are worth the trouble to get sent to me (and thank you Amazon for making this an easy process).  Cocoa Beach is worth it!  I've noticed some comments about the box sizes--yes they are small, but the ounce content (14.3) of the typical box is not different than other cereals, they just don't try to fool you by box size.  Also, as cereals go, this is pretty nutrient dense so the serving size is a 1/2 cup/55 gm/1.9 oz.  Not a big bowl but filling.<br /><br />The product is an excellent offering from Kashi.  It is a no 'high fructose corn syrup' product (yay!).  The base product is 100% whole grain-- a 'seven whole grain and sesame' blend including whole rolled oats, barley, hard red winter wheat, rye, triticale, long grain brown rice, buckwheat and sesame seeds.  The smaller elements are evaporated cane juice syrup, canola oil, almonds, coconut, cocoa, honey, sea salt and the only thing on the list that are hard to recognize as a food product is 'natural mixed tocopherols for freshness'--but is basically variants of vitamin E.  No preservatives or artificial sweeteners/flavors.<br /><br />For the label readers also--there are 230 calories per serving.  There are 9 grams of fat (1.5 saturated, no trans-fats and some of that is the Omega-3).  Zero cholesterol, 140 mg of sodium and for the carbohydrate counters--36 total carbs of which 7 grams are fiber (4 grams insoluble) and 11 grams are sugar.  Add in 6 grams of protein as well.<br /><br />I very much appreciate the non-processed nature of this product--whole foods mixed together in a tasty fashion!  A satisfying crunch with the granola, the cocoa flavoring tempered with almonds and coconut--YUM.  I also find that the balance of carbs/fats/protein (plus what I add with milk) is enough to hold me through the morning without a lot of other snacking desires, though sometimes I do grab a small piece of cheese too.  But that is just me.<br /><br />Also, I mentioned the smaller box--no trying to disguise the amount of product by using excess packaging material.  And, being Kashi, the box is 100% recycled.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, but be aware that for potential allergans "contains wheat, almond, soy and milk ingredients, may contain other tree nuts".  The tree nut one surprised me, nothing other than almonds noted and my husband, who is allergic to tree nuts, has not reacted to this cereal.  I'm SPECULATING that is on the label as the equipment perhaps is used or the facility perhaps processes other products containing these products.  But be aware!<br /><br />And, don't forget to check the specific vendor depending on which product page you came to on Amazon to make sure you are getting a sensible amount of food for your money.<br /><br />JTG

Love the coconut and there's a more then an adequate amount.....and plenty of almonds, too.  DELICIOUS!!  Yes, it's a small box....less packaging is good....but the inner bag is full and if you check the weight against another box of good, quality cereal, you'll find it's equal in over-all weight.  Besides, you'll probably find you eat less anyway.

review/text: I bought this for my husband and I to try to eat something healty without feeling like it was healthy.  On it's own, my husband didn't care for it (I liked it)...but mix in just a little cocoa pebbles to help get the milk chocolately and you have a big winner for everyone!<br /><br />Now we eat these regularly.  The granola helps fill us up until lunch so we don't want to snack.  Mixing in a bit of the cocoa pebbles ensure you don't feel like you're eating anything healthy and it's something we actually look forward to eating in the morning!

review/summary: Yummy, but tiny box!
review/text: This is super yummy granola, but the boxes are super small. I had read the reviews, so I was somewhat prepared when they came, but still somewhat shocked at how small they really were. The overall cocoa taste of the granola does make up for the lack in size, and unless you are eating huge bowl fulls of the cereal, I think it should last plenty long- especially since you get 4 boxes for the price. I just eat it as a snack- dry- and it last quite a while that way. It does have great nutritional stats- 7g of fiber and 6g of protein, with only 11g of sugar- which I think is amazing.<br />Overall a great purchase, and I love the convenience of having is delivered for free.

review/text: This is an amazing cereal.  It tastes great and is pretty healthy for you, imagine that.  I buy soo much of this stuff. I hope Kashi never discontinues it and I never get tired of it.  I try to have a bowl of this a day.  This is a very filling cereal, so a little bit goes a long way.  Unlike your big box cereal people that are just sugar coated fluff.  Also, if you are afraid of the coconut, don't be, because you will not even taste it that much.  The bottom line is that you have to try this cereal.  The name is what first caught my attention, it sounds like such a perfect place, fortunately this cereal backs up the name with its taste and ingredients.

review/text: I bought this for my husband initially - he likes some of those chocolate cereals. Later at home, I realized it has coconut flakes, and he's not fond of that, so it was now 'my' box of cereal. OMG, it's what I want to eat for breakfast, and what I look forward to as my late night snack. Some nights, I'll try something else for a variety, yet not feel 'satisfied'. I've been going through about a box a week. I was feeling guilty about the calories thinking I was eating much more than the suggested serving. So, last night, I measured my typical portion and found it was a 1/2 cup. Yea! That's the serving size. So, I had seconds.

review/text: Never before have I had granola like this! The chocolate is baked in to the granola and there are plenty of delicious coconut shavings -- not the sweetened, shredded kind of coconut you usually buy in the grocery store for baking. By the time you finish the cereal in the bowl your milk has become chocolate milk for an added treat at the end. (I use Almond milk which I think makes it even more delicious (and lactose free.) I'm now a Cocoa Beach granola addict!

You will probably find better prices in stores than here.<br />-Not a large selection of flavors right now.<br />-No surefire method of making sure you add the right amount to water (who always drinks just 8 fluid ounces?) And one 'squeeze' is quite different from person to person.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Its delicious, it can turn water into instant kool aid! But seriously, it doesn't make it taste fake, like a diet soda.<br />- Calorie free<br />- Can choose how much to add to your liking (a hint of sweet, or a bit more for a more gatorade/kool aid taste).<br />- Is liquid so doesn't clump up like the dry/sugar packet water enhancers.

review/summary: May have saved my life
review/text: Being a person who has hated water all of my life, I have tried various ways to make water palatable and always failed.  Doctors, friends, family and various health articles all say our bodies need x amount of water daily.  Well, for me to drink water was always a dreaded experience because drinking a glass of water felt like a ton of lead in my stomach, so I just did not drink it. On rare occasions when really thirsty, I will make an effort to swallow water and force myself to not let it come back up. Because of my intense dislike of water, I can truthfully say I only drink a (small) glass of water about twice a year.  Really.  I don't  drink sodas, beer or much of any other beverage except milk. I love milk. But, the only water in my diet is what I get from coffee (1 or 2 cups a day) and whatever other foods/drinks that might contain water. But never just plain water.  Hate it. I have tried a squirt of Lemon in water...hated that too.  In hot weather I will drink Lemonade on occasion, but still not enough to say I got my daily requirement.<br /><br />Well, someone told me to at least try Mio to see what I think about it.  Tonight was the first time I tried it and now I feel that finally, I have found something to add to water to make it palatable to me, thus taking a big step to making myself healthier. In the long run, this product can be responsible for saving my life or at least making the rest of my life healthier by making water something I will now drink on a daily basis and actually enjoy it.

review/summary: Kind of Like Vitamin Water
review/text: One firm squirt of any of these MIO flavors gives as much flavor as the Vitamin Waters and Sobe Life Waters (without the added vitamin benefits). I would have preferred MIO to have have a bolder taste, kind of like Crystal Light,  but MIO's taste is actually pretty subtle, in contrast to the vivid and distinct color it adds to water. Nonetheless, it's a refreshing compliment to water when you need a break from the plain taste of H20.<br /><br />I have tried doing more squirts as well and I'd say about 4 squirts provides a stronger  flavor, not as sweet as fruit juice but more than just the taste of ligtly flavored water.<br /><br />Another thing I did with MIO was add it to my plain greek yogurt in the morning with some fruit. The berry pomegranate one in particular was quite tasty with the yogurt and a few fresh blueberries. It sounds weird, I know, but it was delicious-gave me the taste of traditional fruit yogurt without all excess calories and sugar found in fruit yogurt at the supermarket.<br /><br />My preference of flavors in this 3 pack from most to least liked: 1)Berry Pomegranate 2) Strawberry Melon 3) Fruit Punch.  My sister said the fruit punch flavor tasted medicinal but I didn't find that to be the case for myself.

review/summary: OK But More Expensive Than You Might Think
review/text: I have enjoyed this product as an altenative to Crystal Lite. However, when I looked at the "serving size," I realized I was paying WAY more than I even thought. I probably use three times what they consider a serving, which makes for an expensive drink, considering one little container is about $3-4. In other words, the serving size is deceptive so don't use that to determine price per glass made.

Not a huge water drinker but this helps keep me from drinking pop when I want something flavorful.I have tried many different flavors of this and they are awesome.Some people who use it have told me it makes them sick to their stomach and others say it taste like watered down Gatorade. I like it, but it just depends on your taste I guess. I think you should absolutely try it for yourself because you can never really go by what someone says! Someone said it was too expensive but honestly your buying a variety pack and they are always more expensive but to be honest it is not that much more expensive then what you'll pay for in the stores (lets add up the gas costs to jump in the car and go to the store just for some Mio...)So to me it is worth it to pay more online because I am a college student I NEVER go to the store for anything anyway and I have amazon prime so free two day shipping to pay more on an item isn't too bad.

review/summary: Convenience and Great Taste
review/text: I ordered this product on a whim just to see what it was like. I'm really glad I did. First, it's very convenient. The bottles are easy to carry in my car or satchel at work. The bottles stay closed very tight so there is no chance of it spilling and making a mess. Second, the taste. All three flavors in the variety pack taste really good and it was nice to have a chance to try them all to see which my favorite is. I like them all but prefer the strawberry/watermelon. My wife loves the berry pomegranate and my daughter is a big fan of the fruit punch.<br /><br />As far as price...yes there are cheaper ways to go and you can get the powder mixes at any dollar store and get more for your money. The thing that will make me by this product again is how easy it mixes and how you can control your taste. Honestly you don't even have to really stir it in a glass or shake it in a bottle. It mixes almost instantly. Plus, as I stated, you can adjust it to your own taste which is a big plus. Overall a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I liked it so much I instantly ordered the "energy" version and can't wait to give that a try.

review/summary: Handy for travel, backpacking and drinking carb, calorie and sugar free!
review/text: Mio works great if you want to sweeten water, especially as a substitute for soda. For people who choose to eat low carb, such as the Atkins method, this provides a way to enjoy a sweet tasting drink without the carb or sugar penalty. I wanted to avoid diet soda and anything sweetened by Aspartame too (as suggested in the Atkins book). MIO is just the ticket (it's sweetened by Splenda). This stuff is small, easy to use and tastes good to. It helps me to drink plenty of water and provides easy travel options. I also use it to flavor water when camping, hiking, at work and on weekend trips. The bottle is so small and light and sweetens 24 cups worth of water.<br /><br />When I first started using this, I would over flavor things. After just a few times it's easy to determine about how much to squeeze into the size of container you are using. The fluid is very concentrated so be careful not to splash or spray it on your clothes. 1 bottle lasts me several days and I drink it all day long. It dissolves instantly, just a little stir and your drink is ready. If you really crave the Soda fizz, you can add it to plain soda water too.<br /><br />Mango Peach is my favorite flavor. I rank the flavors about like this:<br />1. Mango Peach<br />2. Fruit Punch<br />3. Strawberry Watermelon<br />4. Orange Tangerine<br />5. Berry Pomegranate<br /><br />The price varies wildly, check your local stores too. Give it a shot and you'll be happy you did.<br /><br />5 stars for a great product, providing a carb free option.

review/summary: No taste with filtered bottle
review/text: I guess some of you may have guessed this before buying. Good for you. However, for those of you, like me, who use bottles that filter the water, be aware that the filter "filters" out the flavour as well. So, these drops are great for bottled water or water from the tap that is prefiltered or not filtered, but if you use bottles that filter the water as you drink it, the filter actually takes the flavour right out and what you taste is only water. It's not fair for me to rate the product lower because of my stupidity, but I think it's a good thing for people to know before they order.

review/text: If you're the sort of person that "just can't drink plain water" then this will probably make it easier. However, I couldn't finish this three pack and threw the unused two away. It makes water either slightly off-tasting if you add a little or overwhelmingly sweet if you add a little more.<br /><br />If you don't like water by itself you're probably much better served with unsweetened ice tea or herbal teas. They won't taste extraordinarily artificial.

review/summary: Not a good fence charger.
review/text: I purchased this charger and it was delivered as advertised.  Placed it in the daylight for three days as directed and set it up on our corral fence.  Unfortunately, from the very first time it was turned on the charger did not work correctly.  A call to the company yielded two solutions.  (1) Place it in the sun for three more days or (2) Send it in for repair.  Instead, I chose option (3) Send it back to Amazon.com (which was done in fine fashion, thank you) and purchase a Zareba LIS3B which has worked and is still working perfectly.  I would not recommend the Fi-Shock SS-440.

review/text: We live in SW NM and we have sun, sun, sun, but found this charger will sometime NOT hold a charge for a day or longer.  It is in the open and has all day sun exposure.  A bit of a disappointment and the company is of no help in wanting to fix it or make it right.  It is a poor product that was from the start and if we want to replace it or get it fixed (right after we bought it) they want us to pay shipping to get it back to them.  SO, we are hoping for the best that the horse knows that it works (most of the time) and will respect that and not charge through the fence.

The fence protects my vegetable garden from the numerous deer, raccoons, possums, groundhogs, and rabbits that live in the woods nearby.  I let it charge for three days as recommended and then turned it on.  Works great!  It is quite a bit more powerful than my old charger, and I now don't have to worry about checking the batteries periodically.

review/summary: Lower output voltage than advertised.
review/text: I was disappointed to only get about 4KV output voltage from the Fi-Shock SS-440 solar powered unit.  It was advertised to produce 8KV +/- 20%, so that should be about 6.5KV anyway.  Mine is only producing 4KV.  It is  installed and grounded according to the Fi-Shock booklet.  It is only a single wire about 1/3 mile long with no weeds, so is clearly under the 5 mile advertised rating.

This may be an issue if you need to replace a faulty charger immediately, or wish to store this and use as a temporary charger.

review/text: I have found this solar electrical fence very useful; and it works nicely keeping the steer where he should be.  I don't have a 5 mile run of fence, so can't say how far it does work, but I don't have to worry about starting a fire in the dry season with this lower powered intermittent zapper.  I have seen it kill weeds though.  And it does take longer to recharge in the sun [And I live in Florida] if it has completely drained out because the deer have shorted it on the fence.  More than a day.  So I keep an extra battery about, which seems to re-charge up quickly if it had previously been charged.<br /><br />Required Disclosure: All reviews must include the following disclosure text: within the review content, in a separate paragraph following your commentary, within the parentheses but without the quotation marks: (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

review/summary: Helps keep the dentist away!
review/text: I have a 6 year old male Maine Coon cat who came to me as a kitten from the breeder with a strong recommendation to continue feeding him Royal Canin cat food. Three years ago during my cat's annual checkup, my vet found moderate to severe dental disease and a tooth that needed extraction, not uncommon in this breed. I had the dental work done and immediately switched him from the "Maine Coon" type of Royal Canin to the "Oral Sensitive 30" formula. For two years after the switch, my vet has given my cat a clean bill of dental health. Just last year, he found some plaque but nowhere near as serious as the first time. This year he will have a preventive dental cleaning. I feel that Royal Canin "Oral Sensitive 30" had contributed significantly to my cat's improved dental health.

review/summary: EXCELLENT Pepperoni!
review/text: I've been searching for a great quality pepperoni. I usually buy organic and all natural. This pepperoni is absolutely delicious! It's different than most pepperoni sticks. Its flavor is sweeter and has a distinct pepper flavor. Most pepperoni sticks are just too salty and overpowered with spice. Fortuna's is great on pizza. My only negative comment would be the price. It's much too expensive than other pepperoni products. We normally pay around $6.00 or $7.00 for two sticks of another all natural pepperoni, but have been unable to get it at this time. On Fortuna's brand, we spent $27.00 for two sticks including shipping. This will prevent me from buying again.

review/summary: Great option for 'natural' pepperoni
review/text: There aren't many options out there for pepperoni without nitrates added so I coughed up the money and ordered this.  It is delicious!  Just what I wanted and since it's not like I use tons of pepperoni, I can afford to spend a little extra to get better quality for our pizzas.

review/summary: Fortuna's -- The Best!!!
review/text: I am from RI, and have been to Fortuna.  Not only do they make sausage, their store is a sandwich shop beyond description.  They will make you a combination sopressata, pepperoni, green pepper, onion, olive and olive oil sandwich on freshly baked bread that is beyond belief.  Forget Italian food from NYC, Chicago or San Francisco.  RI has the real thing and Fortuna's maintains the Sicilian tradition religiously.  All of their products are exceptional which is why they are more expensive.  Real Old World craftsmanship and taste.

review/summary: Pepperoni
review/text: I expected a different taste and did not like this pepperoni's taste. I expect its flavor is what the home countrymen expect and prefer, but my expectations are based on pepperoni slices on 1950's American style pizza. Don't blame the product, blame the taster! I do not think my ratings reflect on the product per se but only my personal opinion

review/text: I LOVE this flavor of the on the go packets. But  I can't find it anywhere either..I even tried ordering it from Walmart.com (it's cheaper than grocery stores or target) and they were completely sold out of the product online too.  What's up with that?  It's more expensive here on Amazon but it's the only place I can get it.  I drink this in the morning before breakfast & I notice my sugar intake has gone down as well as portion size...I stay full with this flavor, I can't explain it.  It's great, highly recommend it!

I find that this curbs my hunger so that when I get home from work I don't feel famished and raid the fridge.

I used to drink it all day, every day, and it really did what it says it does, it satisfies your hunger, you want to eat less.<br /><br />And now it is off the shelves, and I can't even find it among the products that Crystal Light lists on its website. I emailed them, asking why this is not manufactured anymore. I have not known anyone who has had this who doesn't love it. It is not as tart as all the other CL flavors, and its effects are wonderful. I realized I gained a few pounds lately, and just figured out last night it's because I haven't had this drink in weeks! I don't know if I'm eating more, but I do know that I was happier when I had it.<br /><br />If I can afford amazon's price for it and they are keeping it in stock, I will be getting it here. If it totally goes away, Kraft will have made a big mistake.

It is not effective for nor is it intended to be a meal or snack replacement.  Mix it in a 16.9 oz water bottle for a more "full" feeling, or mix it into two bottles for a more diluted, tasty drink.  I use this product everyday, if not at least 5x a week.  You should try it!

However the price has gone way up..buyer beware! The drink is delicious but has been repackaged with less servings per box, so this is probably the end of this batch!)

review/text: Smooth and creamy with nice toffee bits but only pulverized specks of almonds. I was duped into purchasing this (original logo said I'd be getting a 12 pack. I now see the logo has disappeared and replaced with what you see now) but that's on me. Sometimes it's buyer beware (I admit 12 bars at $5.25 did sound too good to be true). It gets 3 stars because the chocolate itself is tasty, but at $5.25 for one bar, it is not worth it. Dove chocolate has the same (if not better) consistency, and you can buy a whole bag for about $3. One other note, it didn't taste as chocolatey as I was expecting. It definitely tasted like chocolate, but wasn't screaming it.

review/text: As the reviewer stated before, the orange is quite acidic and the carrot juice is not noticeable.  Hopefully the benefits of the carrots will still be felt in my body though.<br /><br />I purchased the orange and carrot as the Lakewood brand's Carrot juice has lemon juice in it which is not truly carrots only.  Carrots by themselves are excellent in a juice form I don't know why they can't stick to the basics or come up with a better flavor to mix than orange or lemon.
