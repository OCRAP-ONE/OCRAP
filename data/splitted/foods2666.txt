review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I found two of the finest resturants in my home town of Reno using this coffee.  I asked the waiters for the brand of the coffee because it tasted so smooth and really woke me up.  Since buying this product once a month my wife and I have two cups in the morning and it starts our day off with a nice wake up feeling.  We now pay $19+ for monthly coffee.

review/summary: Best home brew coffee!
review/text: As did another reviewer... I tried this coffee at a restaurant while out of town for a wedding. I couldn't get it out of my head and eventually called and asked what kind of coffee they served there. It was Boyds. Ordered this as a christmas gift for myself and am very glad I did. I no longer crave expensive coffee house coffee's and really look forward to brewing this at home every morning. It's going to save me big $$. So glad it's a prime item. I'm going to be back for more that's for sure!

review/summary: Delicious, fresh and convenient Five Spice powder
review/text: Frontier Five Spice Powder is a value, also, convenient with a satisfying taste. Quite complimentary too many dishes, although it has a distinct taste, it is not over powering. A few ways to use five spice powder is, simply, sprinkle it on jasmine rice or Thai rice noodles, put in a favorite sweet potatoe dish and/or add to stir frys. It adds tasty, balancing flavors to any dish. I rely on Frontier for quality fresh spices and they did well with their Chinese Five Spice Powder.

review/summary: Good product despite missing one authentic ingredient
review/text: I have been looking high and low for this spice and thought I'd found it...sadly this misses the mark by just a fraction.  It is a good spice but the ingredients of authentic Chinese 5 Spice has Szechuan pepper and not white pepper; perhaps that's why they left out the "Chinese" part in the name?  I found it in a google search and didn't notice that until after I got it.  Also, the lid on this is badly designed.  It is very flimsy and the shaker top broke on the bottle after just one use. Overall I am satisfied with the product though.

review/summary: Great product, price, and well packaged
review/text: This is traditional 5 spice powder.  The right blend - I'm very pleased.<br /><br />The bottles are also nice - nicer than in the picture -  which may seem like a silly thing to care about, but I prefer a nice bottle on my spice rack to a plastic bottle with cheap labeling.  I know that sounds so so silly - but I enjoy cooking more when I feel like I'm using quality ingredients, and I do sometimes (perhaps mistakenly) associate good packaging with quality.<br /><br />The price here is less expensive than what I could find in a store.  The 3 pack was great because I gave 1 away as a gift in a basket along with a few other asian themed cooking items.<br /><br />Packaging was great - bubble wrapped for shipping, but not insanely difficult to unwrap.  I'd buy again, but I imagine the 2 bottles I kept for myself will last me a while.

Even on the Science Diet brands we tried other variations like "Lamb Rice" formula and he did not like that at all. He would rather stay hungry than eat other food. There is something about this "original" formula.<br /><br />One note: make sure you keep the food in a sealed box, in cool dry place, as per instructions.

review/summary: refreshing iced tea
review/text: We became hooked on this iced tea several years ago and have since not been able to find it in our local grocery stores.  All we can find are the diet mixes that use artificial sweeteners - - this one is sugar sweetened.<br />On a whim, I decided to try Amazon - - - here it is.  It was only sold by the case however, the product is shelf stable and we go through it quite quickly as our family drinks this all year round.<br />Tip - - Brewed as directed tends to be a tad too sweet for our taste so we doctor the mix a little by brewing a pot of strong tea using tea bags, then use this mix to flavor and sweeten the tea.  Play around with the doctored measurements to suit your own taste, but we brew 5 teabags, mix with 5 tbsp of mix to fill a standard 2 quart pitcher.

review/summary: The official drink of the Navy Seals
review/text: Flying over the rugged terrain of Pakistan, a team of Navy Seals, thirsty hungry and tired, were hot on the trail of a war criminal.  Their mission - bring him to justice.<br /><br />After weeks of searching in the hot Pakistani desert, they had finally located his mansion.  Inside, lay 20 or 30 guards.  The Navy Seal team approached but their dry throats kept them from being able to talk to each other.  That's when Navy Seal Team Commander Jacob Michaels commandeered an old barely functioning pump.  The sludge water was deadly toxic to people even to Bear Grylls and his pee drinking self.  Desperate, they opened their 10 quart tea mix, poured some in - and out came rainbows and goodness that the world has never seen before.  The seal team drank their magic tea elixir and continued on their mission.<br /><br />As they approached the house one of the Pakistani guards noticed the team, and called an alert.  20 bearded men started shooting randomly at the exposed seal team.  But by the grace of Lipton, the commander tossed his can into the middle of them, which exploded into a cloud of choking biohazardous gas.  8 of the Pakistanis died instantly, and the dust cloud made it easy for the Seal team to get inside.  Shouting FIRE IN THE HOLE three more canisters were tossed into the compound, blinding and choking most any living thing in the area.<br /><br />When breaking into Bin Laden's room, the Seals, now down to the last of their 6 cans, decided to hold back their can to help provide cover in case of a fire fight.  Breaking down the door, the commander - firearm in one hand, tea mix in the other, screamed DEATH TO BIN LADEN! and started firing.  Bin Laden fired back, shooting the can, which exploded into awesome particles of win, which surrounded him and suffocated him.  On his dying breath, the tea mix kicked him in the groin and shouted "USA BITCH!"<br /><br />The tea mix residue on the Navy Seal uniforms sped up the growth rate of their manly chest hair and beards, making them easy to spot - the handsome rugged bearded men of Seal Team Six.<br /><br />After being flown out of the area, all the hot British chick soldiers were so turned on by the smell of tea around the Navy Seals that they all started stripping which led to a massive orgy.<br /><br />This is why Lipton tea is the best tea anywhere and why buying anything less than a 6 pack makes you a pansy.

review/text: This sauce was first introduced to me by a good friend of mine who is from the Phillipines.  Back home in SC, I would visit my favorite Thai restaurant and bar, and always wondered what sauce they used as their spicy/garlic/chili paste.  This sauce is DELICIOUS on Pad Thai noodles, fish, chicken, pork, and just about anything else that needs a lil' "sprucing up."  I've used this sauce regularly for about 5 years now, and I will not change brands, thought I've tried the Lee Kum Kee version, and this (Huey Fong Sambal Oelek) is by far the best chili sauce I've ever tried!

No aftertaste, undertaste, or sidetaste, just 'good taste' - and it is hot, did I mention that? I use it on all kinds of foods, and it's a staple in my fridge. It doesn't really change the food taste much, which I like.<br /><br />One of my favorites is hot & sour soup, and add a heaping tablespoon of this stuff. Not recommended for the faint of tongue.<br /><br />If you have only a few kinds of hot sauce, this should be one of them.

review/text: My five girlfriends and I have been have been having "Ladies Nite" for about a decade, and drinks are an absolute must. A few years back, someone brought some Moscato and we all raved about it. With all six of us taking turns hosting every third Friday of the month, different brands and kinds of Moscato were sampled and rated. In a scene reminiscent of Goldilocks, some of the drinks were too dry, too sweet, too bitter, or too simple. Ever since then, we've collectively been looking for the perfect bottle. We've tried at least twenty different kinds of Moscato, ranging from the cheapo $6 bottle to the $27 bottle (which was horribly overpriced if you ask me).<br /><br />Now enter SARACCO MOSCATO D'ASTI.<br /><br />Ohhhhh myyyyyyyyy !!!  Finally, here was a drink that made all of us sincerely happy that we are over 21.<br />Sweetly seductive, yet wonderfully sophisticated...Saracco is quite possibly THEE best Moscato on the market.

review/summary: My first order for seltzer flavors!
review/text: My family goes through a lot of seltzer, and recently we purchased a SodaStream to make our own seltzer at home and eliminate the bags of cans that we had to return each week. Before I got started making flavored seltzer, I researched flavorings and the Bakto products seemed the best: they are natural extracts that contain no sugar or artificial sweetener. To try these products and figure out if this was a good way to flavor seltzer water, I started by purchasing the Vanilla & Citrus collection which comes with Vanilla, Bergamot, Coriander (the seed of the cilantro plant, a common cooking spice), Lemon, Lime and Orange. Lemon coriander makes an excellent seltzer flavor, btw.<br /><br />All are high quality extracts, and the only one that is of no use for flavoring seltzer is the bergamot, which is an oil extract rather than a water-soluble alcohol extract. That was kind of a disappointment, because I love bergamot flavor, but I grow bergamot in my garden, so I can just stick a fresh sprig into my seltzer if I really want to! I highly recommend these products.

I found it more tolerable if I only used half the sauce packet.  Also, this product says it has baby corn in it... each of the sauce packets in the case I bought had a half to 1 and a half pieces of baby corn...<br /><br />This product would probably be much better if you add your own veggies and some chicken or something - but that sort of defeats my purpose of having a quick meal...

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: This item arrived a day earlier than expected, and in perfect condition! As for the noodles, they completely blew me away. This is no ramen! These are restaurant-quality noodles, and it couldn't be easier. In each "take-out" carton, there is a pouch of fully-cooked noodles(simply open the pouch, break them up a little and put them in the carton) and a pouch of thick, sweet sauce. Pour the sauce over the noodles, close the carton, and microwave for two minutes. There are no "dry spots" - the entire carton is moist and the noodles seem to develop a glaze. The price is well worth it - though you can get many packets of the cheaper noodles, this is the real deal, AND it has no MSG. Each carton contains an ample serving of noodles, enough to toss with beef, chicken or vegetables, or just to eat on your own! You will not regret this purchase.

review/summary: Sweet Tasty Glaze Great for Adding Chicken & Veggies
review/text: This sweet tasty glaze needs chicken and veggies to accompany the noodles. The noodles are real tasty ones the are glazed nicely by the sauce. It seems there's too much sauce and not enough vegetables. It's a good base for a quick meal at home, great to have in the pantry for a change of pace. At less than 2 bucks a carton on a Manager's Special, it was worth a try.

review/summary: One Word... NAAAAAAAAASSSSSSTTTTTEEEEEEE!!!!!!
review/text: Let me preface this review with a qualification - I regularly have the Ka-Me Teriyaki Noodles when I am at work. They are actually pretty good. That said, I couldn't disagree more with the first reviewer.<br /><br />This item is SO BAD, I gave it 1 star ONLY because there is not an option for NEGATIVE STARS. This product qualifies for a NEGATIVE star rating. The smell when I opened the flavor packet reminded me of UNWASHED FEET. That SHOULD have been my first clue to just chuck the whole box in the trash. However, I gave Ka-Me the benefit of the doubt and nuked the food.<br /><br />The only way I can think to describe the TASTE, is to imagine the smell of a chainsmoker's overfull ashtray, a chainsmoker, with POOR housekeeping skills...<br /><br />NOW, translate THAT into a taste... There you have it.<br /><br />I took ONE BITE, spit it back into the container and chucked the whole thing without even swallowing. It took 3 Snickers Bars to get rid of the aftertaste...

review/summary: Not responsive
review/text: Based on the one positive review - that will teach me - I ordered a banana shrub and this product - two sweet olive tea trees.  I received three plants in a box, wrapped in plastic wrap.  The packing slip said the box contained a banana shrub and the requested two sweet olive tea trees.  However, the tag on the plants and a visual inspection showed that they were slow growing bay trees.  And they were tiny with two or three leaves.  It will take me years to get them to shrub size.<br /><br />I called the number provided inside the box twice and got a recording both times asking me to leave a number and PROMISING EARNESTLY to call.  I left my number and reason for call - twice - and nothing.  It's been almost a month now.<br /><br />Buy from a reputable company that sends what you ordered instead of what they have in stock.  This has been a totally frustrating experience.

review/summary: Just what I was looking for!
review/text: Ever since Twining's changed (destroyed) their Earl Grey tea recipe by using less Bergamot and adding more Lemon hoping people wouldn't notice, I've been desperately looking for a way to get back what has been missing in my tea!<br /><br />I've tried every different brand of tea I can find in attempts to find the best Earl Grey I can, but they never use quite enough of this valuable extract.<br /><br />Now, ever since I bought this bottle of 100% pure edible Bergamot extract my problems are solved!  I only add a few drops to an entire pot of tea and it makes it taste wonderful again!  For a single cup of tea I just wipe the lid on the tea bag and it's perfect!  This will go a long way, because of how potent it is, and 4 ounces is a lot more than I thought it was!<br /><br />I will be buying from this seller again, if their other extracts are half as good as their Bergamot is, that's just fine with me!

review/summary: My cat loves it!
review/text: Not sure about the other review below. Oh well. Each cat is different but I had to switch my 3 and half year old cats dry food because he started to lose significant weight. He looked super boney. And he was doing unusual sleep habits. He typically wakes me up in the morning. For a month he was sleeping when I would rise but then after much research I realized he was dehydrated and I had to move him to wet food or raw food. And since I don't have time to do the raw food (which is timely and costly upfront) I opted to try this stuff out. I am an organic person myself so (duh) it didn't occur to me that the more processed cat food is, obviously the more nutrients my cat will lack.<br /><br />I gave him the salmon flavor, followed the standard directions and he took an instant loving to it. He put on a pound within two days. And he became his old frisky self, pawing my head in the morning to wake me up.<br /><br />The reviews on petco's site are well accurate if you need more reviews. My cat's fur looks good but the convincer was him zipping around like he was a kitten again. The price I pay for the food is relative to how important you think your cat's health is.<br /><br />(Also I forgot to mention that I was feeding my cat a brand that was organic dry food. I guess his body just didn't want it anymore and his becoming thin was obvious that he wasn't getting the nutrition he needed)<br /><br />When I do the math it's only a couple dollars more a month and my cat gets more nutrients than if I kept the dry food and have to add supplements (which is an alternative).<br /><br />This stuff is great! My cat is happy and I'm happy! Just do me a favor and try it out for a week. I hope you will be a satisfied customer like me and my cat.<br /><br />Hope this review helped.

review/text: I have two 7 year old cats that have had a serious history of food sensitivities. Their coats were dry, they would vomit often, and they seemed so sluggish. I have tried a lot of different foods for them; however, Blue Buffalo is the best. They love the Tuna and Salmon. Since I've fed them this, their coats are so much nicer, neither one has vomited, and they're even getting playful again. Also, just this week we took in a very neglected, flea infested 1.5 year old Manx. We treated him for fleas, got his shots, and neutered him. His skin was covered in scabs and sores. Today, his coat is beautiful and soft, his sores are almost completely healed, and he seems so much happier.

review/summary: Iced Coffee is perfect--might make the VUE even more fun
review/text: Iced coffee is something I enjoy. I like it black, no milk or at most a small splash. No sugar. So for me, this is a good, low calorie choice, and it's a great choice for hot mornings in the summer, sipping it for my a.m. caffeine "fix" on my way to work. And I like it on the weekends instead of hot coffee as well.<br /><br />The Nantucket Iced Blend works REALLY well in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007L877MI">Keurig Vue</a>. The Vue is a new version of the Keurig single cup coffee machine, and it has a bunch of new features compared to the current K-cup machines (and by the way, you can get this iced blend in K-cups.) The Vue lets you choose an iced setting that is at an ideal temperature for brewing,  and lets you adjust volume for your desired strength. You can also brew it stronger. The Vue does NOT use K-cups. It uses the Vue cup which is recyclable.<br /><br />The instructions:<br />Fill a 16 oz NON-GLASS (important!) mug with ice<br />Set the Vue to Iced Beverage, put in the Vue cup<br />Choose 6 oz (optimum for over-ice, but you can opt for weaker)<br />Choose Strong (again, the ice dilutes it.)<br />Brew.<br /><br />Why no glass? The addition of hot liquids into a chilled, icy glass can cause your glass to break. I brewed in a ceramic mug, but a metal insulated travel mug is another option.<br /><br />Stronger? Well, the ice dilutes the coffee a lot, so even if you like a light brew, you might find either a lower volume or a stronger brew would be ideal for your tastes. I preferred 6 oz and STRONG setting and got a cup brewed directly onto ice that tastes great. Either way, you can customize the settings on the Vue to make your iced coffee the way you like it.<br /><br />This Vue cup is longer (holding more coffee) to allow for a stronger blend, but there is no reason you can't brew another blend over ice using the ICED BEVERAGE setting. But the Nantucket blend tastes really just right, in my opinion. Excellent!

review/text: This is my favorite vue cup so far, AND I've never been an iced coffee drinker before.  The few I have had in the past I used cream and sugar in them.  With this blend I just use a little 1/2 n 1/2 and it is delicious and refreshing.  Some of the cups I've tried have a little after taste twang to them.  Not this one. Love it!

review/text: These pouches have a tendency to be quite expensive if you go to places like Petco or small boutiques. Our cats personally like all of the flavors that these Wellness pouches come in but we try to order the grain free ones. We don't give them the whole pouch at once and even when they stay in the pouch they don't get as crusted over and stale as when they are in the can. Feeding your cats on the pouches alone however can become rather expensive and we normally supplement the pouches with dry food.

When I have tried other soft food he loses weight because he refuses to finish it or to eat it at all.  I guess he knows what food is the healthiest!<br /><br />I gave this only 4 stars because of the price.

review/summary: Princess: "Do I love this? YES!"
review/text: When Princess came to me, she was on mostly dry food. She didn't seem to interested in her food, and used to dump it into her water before eating it. Her previous foster mum suggested I get her moist food. Then started the search. I purchased cans and pouches. And she didn't seem to interested in most of them. I did find pouches she liked, but they were discontinued. So I found these, and Princess just love them!<br /><br />The thing that Princess likes is the texture. The pouch consists of a square of grain-free food and sauce. The square is about 1cm by 1 cm. The recommendation is to give one pouch per 4 pounds per day, which should be 2 pouches for my 9 pound cat. Well, I tried that, but she put on weight. So I give her 1 pouch per day, plus as much grain free dry food as she likes. She's lean and active, and loves her pouches. I pay an arm and a leg for it, but as long as my Princess is happy, I cannot complain. I've tried cans in the same brand, and she just looks at me like I am crazy. She definitely love this brand, and get different taste every day. And a happy cat makes a happy mum :)

review/summary: My Cats Love This
review/text: All three of my cats love this food, this is the only food that they'll finish off in one sitting!<br /><br />My cats were mostly on Pate Style but I was frustrated because I was throwing a lot of it away because they wouldn't finish it all, so I decided to try this out. I purchased a few different flavors but they prefer Tuna the best. They'll eat the Salmon & Tuna but not with as much gusto as the regular Tuna flavor.<br /><br />My female cat who has strange ways of eating her food did not appreciate the size of the chunks so before I opened up the pouch, I squished the food so it was not in large pieces. This also helps the the gravy absorb in the food so it's not a soup. I now squeeze the pouches for all my cats, they like it better this way.<br /><br />Also, if it stays at the $28.56 price on Amazon, it's the exact same price in the stores.

review/summary: Surprising Results
review/text: I was looking for a new cat food for my cat who is almost 2 years old - he enjoyed his old food, but after reading some articles on the differences in some popular brands I felt compelled to give him a more nutritious product that contained less fillers. I searched online to learn about a variety of product and decided that Wellness was the way to go.<br /><br />My cat isn't picky about his food per se, but he does have distinct likes and dislikes, he loves this stuff! I switched him to 1/2 cup Wellness Dry food and 1/2 pouch of Wellness Healthy Indulgence.  He always eats the gravy first and then will come back for the meat chunks but he eats everything without fail.<br /><br />The results are what have made me a convert and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. My cat's coat is incredibly soft now and he remains active, alert, and very energetic (not overly!).  The coat is really the one place I see a significant change - he had a great coat before, but after a few weeks on this Wellness combo his coat is even softer and vibrant.

review/text: Princess gets a pouch of food every morning. I rotate so she doesn't have to get the same every day. She usually have three different at any given time. This was the first time I purchased Turkey and Duck. These seem to be harder to get out of the pouch than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I first shake the pouch to get everything to settle in the bottom, then I pull it open. So far, so good. But when I then turn it over, the food gets "stuck" in the pouch a bit. So I usually make sure I open the opening first and shake it a little bit around, turn it on its head, and start milking it out. That seems to work.<br /><br />The Princess seems to like it, so I will continue buying.

review/summary: The BEST food for your cats
review/text: When we adopted our cats several years ago, our vet told us it was really important to feed them wholesome food from the beginning (they were kittens at the time).  She recommended Wellness brand, so we picked up several of the flavors of both wet and dry food for the cats to try.<br /><br />Both of our cats immediately loved the "nuggets in gravy" style wet food over the more common pate style and we haven't tried a flavor that they won't eat (although they do strongly prefer the seafood flavors over chicken or turkey).  I like the fact that the ingredients are whole foods - no fillers or cheap grains.  Although not in this combination, they're foods I eat myself - salmon, cranberries, flaxseed, zucchini, etc.<br /><br />I consider this food a win-win because the cats love the taste and texture and I love that they are eating whole foods that contribute to their silky, shiny coats and general well-being.

The pouch is easy to rip open, or can be cut. I highly recommend it as a healthy choice and for your finicky feline :)

review/text: My cat loves the tuna recipe so much, it is the only food she'll gobble down in a single sitting.  Interestingly, she doesn't to be as keen on the other flavors.<br />She seems to especially enjoy the gravy, almost slurping it down!<br />I give her one pouch a day and free-feed her dry, grain-free kibble.  She's healthy and lean, and her coat is silky and luxurious.<br />Maybe it's because I once owned a 96-pound Labrador that ate me out of house and home, but I cannot understand why people would think spending $1 and change per day to feed a pet is expensive...<br />For the price of a soda, you can feed your beloved pet a grain-free, quality cat food.  In reality, the junky, mass-marketed supermarket brands are a real waste of money, because you are paying for filler ingredients and added junk.<br />$1.20 a day is a bargain for the convenience, the quality, what it does for my cat, and how much she enjoys it. I certainly fitter away more than that each day on myself, in the way of "indulgences"!<br />I know that the economy is bad and there are certainly a lot of people who have fallen on hard times, but for those who can afford to keep a pet in the first place, the cost of higher quality food shouldn't be a deterrent.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I originally became a fan of pouch-based cat food with the Nutro line of pouches. However, Nutro was especially hit by the nasty recall episode from a few years back where a number of pet food manufacturers had contamination issues, and they eventually pulled their pouches. I tried a bunch of canned foods afterwards, but my cats never warmed to any of them like they did the pouches.<br /><br />Wellness came out with their "healthy indulgence" line of pouch foods not too long ago, and interestingly the packaging is pretty much identical to the Nutro products, down to the notches to facilitate tearing. I can only imagine that they are using the same manufacturing facilities as Nutro did, but hopefully with a superior product. Everything I've read about Wellness suggests that they make high-quality pet foods. My cats seem to love these as much as they did their old pouch foods. They have now been eating pouch foods almost daily for at least 6-7 years, so I don't have any major concerns about long-term health issues.<br /><br />Overall, these pouches are great. Each single pouch is one serving for one cat, so the costs do add up fast if you have multiple cats and serve this twice a day. I give dry food in the morning and the pouches at night to help conserve costs, but they always finish the Wellness pouches within a half hour, whereas the dry food often sits around unfinished all day. Another plus is that no spoons or forks need to be involved, since you just tear each pouch and shake the contents into the bowl. No mess or debates with spouses about putting cat food forks into the dishwasher with the rest of the dishes!

review/summary: Tasty, Grain-Free, and a hit with my cats
review/text: My boyfriend bought a pack as a one-off to tempt his aged kitty- who can be finicky- into eating. His Kitty was uninterested at the time, so I took it home to my little eating machine, who wolfed it down. She's been eating Wellness products almost exclusively for the past two years, and I was interested in finding a gravy-rich wet food in this line. The tuna chunks are substantial - but not too big - and are in a thick, rich gravy. I feed her a mix of 1 pouch of wet food and 1/2 cup of dry daily, and she is both happy and of normal weight. I highly recommend this food for being grain-free, as my cat has had issues with extra fiber clogging her digestive tract in the past, and free of odd, unrecognizable (and unpronounceable) ingredients.

review/summary: Great cat food - great price
review/text: I've been looking for this cat food locally; it seems that everybody is either out or doesn't carry these flavors.  This was great!  Fast Service at a great price.  I will definitely buy here again!

review/summary: cats were not too fond of this food
review/text: They would eat some of it, but not finish it which they do if they really like the food. It is very easy to open and feed as you just squeeze the pouch.
