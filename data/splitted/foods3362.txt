review/summary: Amazing taste
review/text: The taste is amazing. I can no longer find in stores, it seems maybe discontinued which is a shame but thankfully still sold here... for now at least.<br /><br />The picture of the can above is not of this flavor, the guava one is the purple color, but have no worries when you order you get the guava drink.<br /><br />I don't know if the energy is as strong in the guava as other energy drinks, I feel it is weaker, but this one in my opinion is the best tasting.

review/summary: Great Taste and Energy, Buuuut. . .
review/text: I ADORE this drink! It's the next best thing to coffee in the morning (though a lot of people's stomachs probaby handle that . . .But I'm a college student and coffee here is EXPENSIVE!).Heck! It's good for anytime of the day (well . .you may want to avoid drinking it after 6 or so if you want a decent sleep (unless you have to cram for a test or whatever) . .I've only had the original (citrus) kind though . ..I'm kind of curious about the others . . .<br /><br />Anyway, what dissapoints me is the shipping cost . .What the heck!? $20!!??!! That's almost the same amount as the drinks themselves! . . .and here I thought I was getting an uber great deal (it's still cheaper here by a little bit though so I guess I can't complain too much . . .)

review/summary: Doesn't taste like toothpaste or cough syrup. All right.
review/text: By the grace of God, unlike Monster or almost any energy drink (including those horrifyingly disgusting and extraordinarily expensive shots of caffeine which carry the not-so-happy side-effect of making you get hot flashes and flush like it's a freaking rash on your face), this actually tastes palatable. In my experience of tasting energy drinks and shots, they almost invariably taste exactly like toothpaste and/or cough syrup. Not only are they disgusting beyond words and are insanely unpleasant to drink for seemingly no good reason, but they almost always have very little of the single ingredient that matters: Caffeine. Any half-educated energy drink consumer knows this is the only ingredient in the entire thing that actually does anything at all. There's 240mg per can in these, versus the usual 120mg (about the same amount of a standard cup of coffee) in other drinks of the same size, which is just not enough for people like me.<br /><br />This stuff actually tastes like a genuine raspberry soda, has a decent kick, and doesn't taste as horrible as anything Monster has ever made or any of the even more unpleasant energy shots that taste identical to concentrated cough syrup, which then, for seemingly almost everyone, give you a blast of Niacin so insanely high that it even warns you of it ahead of time, and by God, if it lasted more than a few minutes, you'd think you'd need an ambulance. And you pay a *lot* for those suckers.<br /><br />This is really the way to go. It tastes good and has a lot of caffeine, and lacks the bad things most energy drinks have. Since that's really all that matters, I highly recommend it. It never seems to get old.

review/summary: Good, and Bad
review/text: Before I largely stopped drinking energy drinks, these were two of the products i drank a lot of.<br /><br />Overall pros: cheaper than redbull<br />Overall cons: still an expensive habit<br /><br />BLUE CAN, 4 stars:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Interesting/good taste.  It has a very, very fruity taste, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other energy drinks, but could kind of become too sweet/overpowering when I drank too many of these.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Compared to other energy drinks, I do not think that this goes well with alcohol (vodka) at all.  So for normal usage, it's a solid drink, for a redbull/vodka substitute, this wasn't it, for me.<br /><br />WHITE CAN, 2 stars:<br /><br />Pros: Most tolerable when mixed with alcohol.<br /><br />Cons: This is the drink that i think has the most stereotypical awful energy drink/diet taste compared to anything else i've ever had.  It just tastes so artificial and chemical-like.  Why did I even buy this drink in the first place? for a while, it was the only diet energy drink in my university's cafeteria.<br /><br />Conclusion:  I drank hundreds of these over the past 5 or so years until finally pretty much kicking my energy drink habit and switching to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>.

review/text: Caffeine isn't an upper for me, but it's a nice calmative beverage.  I can't have sugar.  So I enjoy sugar free energy drinks.  Rockstar Zero-Carb has a nice berry tea flavor too it.  It's a flavor I can live with, unlike a lot of other drinks.  I can't tell you about the buzz level, since I don't get a buzz, but a can of this will completely knock out any caffeine headache...LOL.  It's got more caff than the Sugar Free.<br /><br />Individual cans are not cost effective.  I was having trouble finding a lot of sugar free energy drinks in my area, and when I did, the prices were high.  I was thrilled to find Amazon had them at good prices... WITH FREE SHIPPING!?!?  Holy cow!  I can get a heavy case of soda shipped to my door for nada?  Now that REALLY rocks!  I don't know how they do it.  The first one came FedEx..LOL.  For free.  And fast, too!<br /><br />I've been an Amazon customer since... yikes, I don't remember the year.  Pretty much since they first opened.  Back when they used to send all their customers Christmas gifts.<br /><br />Rock on!

review/text: At times I wish this weren't an energy drink because I love the way it tastes and I'd like to drink it without the energy effects such as at night. I'm also sure it would be less expensive if it weren't marketed as an energy drink. In any case, I love the taste and it gets me going in the morning sometimes when I'm dragging. It's certainly the best tasting energy drink I've had. If you've tried the non-juiced Rockstar drinks, don't judge this by those. They taste nasty by comparison.

review/summary: Bait and switch!
review/text: Up until this week, I have LOVED Rockstar Juiced with Guava, which is 50% juice.  It is the only energy drink that I have found that I like.  Alas, this week when I purchased a new case of what is advertised as Rockstar Juiced Guava with 50% juice, I discovered that the product has been reformulated to be only 10% juice.  They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories.  The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site.  This is a classic case of bait and switch.  Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink.  What a slap in the face to their customers.  It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back.  At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula.  Will Rockstar be that smart?  I'm not optimistic, but until and unless they do, I will not purchase any more of their products.

review/text: I'm very skeptical about energy drinks, mostly because of a possible caffeine addiction. I haven't tried too many (never tried Red Bull, so really...not that many :p), but this one is great. Granted, there is a lot of sugar in it (40ish grams) PLUS artificial sweetner to make a really sweet drink. But I like the taste, and I too find it refreshing. I drink Juiced Guava maybe once a week to enjoy and it perks me up but not as much as coffee does to the point I get jittery.

review/summary: New formula is absurd!
review/text: When I found out Rockstar Juiced recently changed its formula to 10% juice, I was heartbroken. I instantly fell in love with the drink when it first came out. Its 70% juice formula was to die for. When they changed it to 50% juice, I was a little disappointed since the drink seemed a little unhealthier. However, since the difference in taste was minuscule and since 50% juice is better than no juice, I let it slide. The new Rockstar Juiced is disgusting. It is packed with more sugar and calories compared to the old version and the difference in taste is very noticeable. The after feeling I got from drinking the new one was very uneasy and unsatisfying. I was an avid drinker of Rockstar Juiced. I drank at least one per day, sometimes two. I will now have to revert back to coffee & redbull. At least I am not completely heartbroken since some of my local grocery stores still carry the 50% version. But once they are completely out, goodbye Rockstar Juiced. I will miss you.

review/summary: New reduced juices from 70 to 50% and now 10% YUK!
review/text: We drank the new reduced juice unknowingly and thought yuk what's up with this did we get a bad batch? I searched the new can, knowing it appeared simular but could not find the 10% as it was cleverly hidden in the back. I then went to my recycle bin for an old can and compared. No longer proudly displayed on the front 50% real juice. I have justified this expensive,tasty and addictive treat for years and alloted 1 per family member per day. Now this case is going back and we are done with Rockstar until they bring back the higher real juice formula. I even had a stomach reaction to this one and I tend to have a goat gut. Bad taste bad product change and pissed that they reduce the juice keeping the price the same 2-3.00 per can, another misguided by greed rogue corporation. Now I cannot help but wonder if that blogger that rants that Rockstar is owned by Nazi's has some credibility. My wife really resented the fact that the new packaging was predominently identical to the old decieving her into purchasing a product she did not want or like.Back it all goes.

review/text: Been drinking Rockstar Juiced since it came out. I hardly noticed the 70% to 50% change in their formula, but the new 10% forumla is horrible.  Where Rockstar was once the best energy drink out there, this change in formula will easily put the other energy drinks with juice on top. Hope Rockstar sales plummit and they can see their mistake and make the change now.

review/summary: Quite possibly the greatest drink ever!
review/text: I bought this back a while ago, and I'm still reaping the benefits of drinking this miraculous beverage.  I feel more alert, my social life has improved, and my urine has a wonderful neon yellow hue.<br /><br />Even though it is sealed quite nicely in it's case, after you are able to remove the can, you may want to cool down your energy drink.  My preference was to put the cans in my refrigerator, but you could get a similar effect by setting the cans in a snow bank, or by using ice cubes in a glass to cool the drink down.  My first problem came when I was ready to drink the Diet Rockstar(tm).  I looked at the can and was perplexed as to how to open it up, until I noticed this clever "tab" at the top that would pop open a perfect sized drinking hole to use.<br /><br />Once I opened it up, I quickly poured the entire contents of the Diet Rockstar(tm) into my mouth and then swallowed it.  I had heard of people not caring for the last few drops of a warmed can, so I figured that it would be best to drink it before it had the opportunity to warm up.  What a great decision that was!  Shortly afterwards I felt a burst of energy surge through my body and I was more productive then I have ever been in my life.  Normally I would take a 8:30am nap at work, but not today.  Was was ready to work and to get everything completed in a orderly fashion.  However, a problem soon surfaced as there was no more work to do for a few hours and I had all this energy to burn off.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and would suggest that everyone purchase as much as you can.  This drink will change your life and make you complete all of your activities with ease.

review/summary: Survived shippment to Afghanistan
review/text: I purchased this product to send to my son who is currently deployed in Afghanistan.  Amazon does a great job shipping to APO addresses.  My son received his Amazon goodies in about a week.  He enjoys sharing the snacks I send him with his friends so this the perfect size package for this. Thanks Amazon for doing such a great job.  Oh, and the crackers and cookies were delicious, as my son reports.

review/summary: Something for every taste
review/text: I bought these in a warehouse club locally, so I am just reviewing the product. I was getting frustrated with my husband buying a packet of these crackers everyday out of a vending machine at work. To save costs I bought this pack for around 8 bucks and he can snack for an entire month. Also handy at home when he has a low blood sugar attack. My favorite is the toasty crackers with peanut butter, they are tasty.

True there's more water than anything else, but there also is both ground and diced beef (in perceptible quantities), black soybeans, green peppers etc.  And they were thinking of people like me who need to watch their carbs. I'm grateful to have found something that doesn't have to be refrigerated before it's opened, tastes wonderful and is good for me.  Only desideratum, the possibly to buy a six pack, or to put it on a subscription.<br /><br />Didn't expect much, thinking I was paying on $3.33 per package as the site suggests, but in fact though a six pack is shown and the price listed is $3.33, the price is in fact $6.66 since there are only three boxes in the pack.

review/summary: A staple for gluten-free kitchens
review/text: This is the rice flour for gluten-free cooking.  Unlike other rice flours, the super-fine grind is not gritty so baked goods can have the same smooth finish as those made from wheat flours.  If tightly wrapped, it keeps indefinitely in the freezer so one can afford to buy it in bulk.  I also highly recommend Authentic Foods' superfine brown rice flour and gluten-free flour blend.  My wheat-eating husband says the cinnamon rolls I baked with it are the best he's ever eaten, wheat or no wheat, gluten or no gluten.  If you've been disappointed with other brands, as we were, you really should try this.

review/text: I still remember the first time I made GF chocolate chip cookies from this flour...they rose, they looked amazing, and for the first time in our allergen-free diet, they had the texture of traditional baked goods...I was sold!<br /><br />I love this flour, (and here's the soapbox) but I just don't understand the extremely high shipping cost.  I requested it at Whole Foods and was told they stopped carrying it/ordering it because of the shipping cost.  I don't know much about those things, but I do know it arrives in a box, no special packing (sometimes a bit battered and beaten up), standard shipping.  I've checked out the weight on some shipping sites, and even factoring that in, the shipping cost is high.  I really wish they would lower it so I could afford to buy this amazing product more!<br /><br />P.S. After filing this review, I received a $2.75 refund for shipping costs!  Woo hoo!  Thank you Authentic Foods!

review/text: We are using the Born Free bottle/cup system for our daughter who is now 17 months. As you can imagine with a toddler, items have a tendency to disappear (tossed out the stroller, dropped out of bags, etc), so we've found we have misplaced many of the tops that came with the bottles/cups.  These lids work great for both the bottle nipple and the training/drinking cup spouts.<br />I wasn't sure if I would be getting 2 or 4 lids based on the description and the picture, "Twin Pack - 2 pack", did that mean I'd be getting 2 twin packs? especially since the picture shows 2 stacks of 2 lids.  But the price was good for 2, so I went ahead and ordered. And sure enough, I received 2 lids.

review/summary: Can be a little strong
review/text: If you like vanilla - I mean really like it - this will probably be a great tea for you.  I love the immense vanilla aroma when I open the can, it's like one of those vanilla scented candles.  The only thing is that I think it's a bit bitter and maybe too strong a vanilla taste to drink straight.  So I commit the tea-lover's sin and add a little skim milk, and that makes it perfect for my taste.  As far as the almond, I really don't taste it or smell it, the vanilla overpowers it, but that's ok with me.<br /><br />I was actually looking for a replacement for Celestial Seasoning's Almond Sunset, and until I find something better, this will be it.

review/summary: Good quality, affordable food.
review/text: It's really important to me to feed my pets quality food.  My first dog had severe allergies to food, and all of the vets we took her to caught that.  She had terrible skin rashes, raw hot spots, and constant ear infections--all of which are indications that she had food allergies.  I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)

review/summary: Made my dog's coat shine
review/text: I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer.

review/summary: Great value product that is full of protein
review/text: We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones. We also switched to pasture raised beef and hogs. Once again, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no corn feed. What a difference in ease of weight control. Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise. She was impressed with their progress at 9 years old. My geriatric children love the taste and no longer hesitate around the food bowl. The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal. We have started topping it off with Dogswell canned dog food just to add an extra bit of flavor and our dogs have never been happier.

review/summary: Very good food.
review/text: I've spent years reading labels on dog food bags, trying to establish a balance between good food and a reasonable price. Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary. I confess, I recently strayed to another brand in search of a food that I didn't have to drive thirty miles out of my way to get. On the surface the other food seemed to fit the bill (no wheat or corn). But after a few weeks on the other food, my old hound began shaking his head a lot and two hot spots appeared. I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.<br /><br />So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen). What a relief to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price and even more reasonable shipping charges.

review/summary: Great For Dog With Allergies
review/text: My German Wirehaired Pointer had bad doggy BO.  It would return shortly after she was bathed.  My vet thought that it might be due to a food allergy, and suggested we try a food containing ingredients she had not been exposed to previously.  This Premium Edge food filled the bill, and it has reduced the doggy BO to normal levels.  The Amazon price for the food was friendly, and UPS delivered the heavy sack right to my door.  What's not to like?

review/summary: Seems to Be Good Food - Dogs Like It.  Does have an Odor While Other Premium Foods Do Not.
review/text: We have been through 3 brands of dog food over the past 3 years because of price/availability on Amazon.  This is the last (Amazon delivered) brand we tried because our regular brand became unavailable.<br /><br />The Premium Edge Salmon seems to have a quality list of ingredients & seems comparable to the Costco Salmon brand (Costco is slightly cheaper but Costco requires an annual membership fee & Amazon delivers to your doorstep).  The food does have an odor that we didn't find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I've had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying. Both this brand & the Costco brand is manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods, a company that has had a lot of recalls in the past (in fact, both this food & the Costco food were subject to recall in early 2012).

review/summary: Looks like good stuff!
review/text: The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.

review/summary: Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg
review/text: I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)

review/summary: My dogs eat it. Ingredients are better than anything at the grocery store.
review/text: I didn't plan on writing a review for this product. I mean, it's dog food. I don't eat it! But I read a review or two that complained about dogs getting gas after eating this. I have three dogs: 11.0 pounds, 33 pounds and 96 pounds. I tried to mix like is always suggested, but my dogs just made a mess and picked out the new stuff like they always do. I held out and hoped they'd finish of the old brand, but they didn't, which is par for course with my dogs. (I'm weak.) So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me). My bottom line: My dogs like it, my wife is satisfied with the ingredients, and the price isn't insane. I intend to buy it for awhile and see...

review/summary: Superb, top of the line dry dog food
review/text: I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box. Opened the box & the bag had no tears, scuffs, or any damage. Perfect condition. I dumped the dry food into my storage box & liked the fact there's no artificial colors. I also liked the small kibble size. It's perfect for any size dog to eat. I mix canned food into the dry & it mixes so much easier with the smaller bites. I add canned tuna or salmon cat food to the dry food. The fish oils seem to be good & healthy for them. Also makes their fur soft & shiney. But, do that only on your own accord, I'm NOT a vet!  My 3 big Labs went bonkers over this stuff. They scarfed it down like it was a hamburger. I got a kick out of them wagging their tails & chowing down on their food so happily. After dinner they drank their water, & went outside as usual. Came back in & were much obliged happy campers. There was no usual rolling around, itching, & scratching all over the place. They were calm, cool, and extremely satisfied & so am I. So I give this a positive 5 STARS!<br />I believe my dogs to have food allergies to the cheap dog foods out there, & will try to keep buying this fantastic food for them.

review/summary: Only Brand I now Recommend
review/text: I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called "premium" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  "Lamb meal" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat.

Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.

He has been eating the salmon and potatoes formula exclusively for about a week and a half and now he is hardly ever licking his paws!!!  Today I even skipped his claritin and he has not licked his paws all day.  No more grains for my dog!

review/summary: Not so great..Expiration date soon..
review/text: I decided to try this dry food on my two dogs, because of all the great reviews.<br /><br />However....Neither dog will eat it.  One dog took a couple bites, and refuses to eat it..The other dog wont even take a bite.<br />I tried mixing it with their favorite can food, but this only made matters worse.  They would not even touch it.<br /><br />I was confused about this, since one of my dogs will eat just about anything, while the other will eat dry food mixed with cannned.<br />The reviews were all good, so...<br /><br />I checked the package...And, I think I may have found the answer...There is a last sale date of April 11, 2012....That's only about 6 weeks away.<br />I would never purchase a food that was going to expire so soon, even on sale in a store.<br /><br />I now have a huge bag of dog food in the kitchen..I have tried daily to give each dog a little, but no go.  They will not eat eat it!<br />The pieces are all the same size and color...Not appealing, and there is not even a smell that says "eat me, I am food".  Could be cardboard, judging by<br />the dog's reaction.<br /><br />Kind of hard to return, since it is opened and is 18 pounds of dog food.<br />I have a feeling it is either because the food is so old, or it is tainted.  Dogs can sense when there is a problem with food!<br /><br />Sorry about the bad review...But, This was money that will just end up getting poured into the rubbish.<br />Maybe I was only the unlucky one...Check the last sale dates on your package if any of your dogs wont eat it!<br /><br />I will stick to Pedigree and Mighty Dog..less expensive, not as healthy, but both my dogs love it.<br />I cannot recommend this brand..I have two large dogs, mixed breed and are not usually choosy about what they eat.<br />Except for the Premium Edge, which they give  a paws down to!

review/summary: Milk for my cereals any time.
review/text: I don't eat cereals every morning so buying a gallon or half a gallon of milk is a waste of money.  I throw away so many because the milk goes bad before I can finish it. Also, fresh milk does a number on my stomach so it is very costly for me to buy even a half gallon of milk.  It just dawned on me that I like coffee mate in my coffee so I thought about using it as a milk substitute for my cereals.  I use just 1 teaspoon and mix with little hot water to get the powder dissolved and then put in ice cold water to make milk for my cereals.  Just 1 tsp makes the milk so creamy and delicious.  With this canister, I can have milk with my cereals anytime and not wasting any more $ for throwing away bad milk.<br /><br />BTW, don't use more than 1tsp of coffee mate for milk substitute.  The flavor can be a little overpowering with your cereals if you use too much.  But overall, it's a good milk substitute for anyone who cannot tolerate dairy products like me.

review/text: Coffeemate Coffee Creamer- Product Review<br /> For as long as I can remember I have been an avid coffee drinker, picking up coffee at a gas station or Starbucks to start out most of my days. Growing up my mom always drank her coffee black so I never had much experience with creamers. When I did, however, get ahold of creamers there was no going back to sugar and creamer. Coffeemate was the first one I tried, and although I have had others I always seem to go back to the brand I believe to be the best. Not only do they have multiple flavors to choose from, they are all cheaper than one cup of coffee at a specialty coffee house and it lasts a lot longer.<br />I have recently discovered the powdered version of Coffeemate's creamers and I have to say it is a great idea. There have been so many times where it would be great to have creamer but you have no fridge- or no space in a fridge. This creamer is simple to use, all you do is put a few spoonfuls (or your desired amount) into your coffee cup, pour in coffee and stir.  I use this powdered creamer at school, work and even while camping. Being a student, and always on the go it is great to have a product that you can rely on to taste great but to also be convenient.<br /> I, myself, am not lactose and tolerant but I have a friend who is and she can use this product in her coffee or even tea and not have to worry about dairy. Another thing about this powdered version that I have recently learned is that is can be bought online in bulk. When buying the liquid creamer in stores it has an expiration date that will not allow you to buy more than one or two at a time. So buying the powder in bulk will save you money, even more than making your own coffee at home is.<br />There is only one downside I have been able to think of about the powder versus the liquid and that is the powder takes longer to stir into your coffee. The liquid barely needs to be stirred while the powder takes a few seconds to get any lumps out.<br />It is a great product all around for anyone who drinks coffee. I would recommend it to all, even those who swear by their straight black coffee, this may change their mind and show them something new. I would also recommend it to people who want to do something different with their hot tea or hot chocolate. I have put it into both and it adds a nice touch of flavor that was missing before. So even if you are not a coffee drinker you can still enjoy what this creamer has to offer.

review/summary: Outside of fresh real cream...this is the BEST for our java!
review/text: Started using Coffeemate powder in college and a couple<br />decades later STILL find it to be THE BEST in our coffee! Outside<br />of real rich cream (which is too fattening and only as a treat<br />and anytime we travel on holiday)we have always come back to Coffee Mate<br />and thats all we ever buy now.....about the dissolving, we've never had any<br />problems with it...it's delicious!  And best in bigger containers too!

review/summary: Doesnt dissolve!!
review/text: I purchased this 'bargain' size but it resists being mixed into a hot cup of anything, resembling curdled milk or cream. Since there's so much and it actually does not have the same rich mouth taste which is why I bought it to use with milk as a cheaper version of half and half....now I'm thinking as I write this that maybe if I pre-mix this with boiled water and store it in the fridge like 'cream' that the curdled issue will not be an issue.<br />But otherwise, sometimes it pays to spend a bit more for something known and just enjoy it

review/summary: Cooks fast - add stuff / honey - nuts, eat like oatmeal
review/text: Great for people with gluen sensitivity or anyone with allergies.  Similar to oatmeal in nutrients...not as thick, more gel-like, but lends itself well to any flavor added to it, honey, cinnamon - the possiblitiies are endless.  This is the best buy on the web for it.  Best to stock up, it goes fast.  Also makes a great thickener for whatever you add it too (during cooking)...very soluble fiber - high protein and good for you.  It is yellowish in color and has these funny little spirals.  The orginal whole grain take longer to cook / 15 minutes, but all I do with this stuff is mix it with water - a few minutes in the microwave and BAM - its food!  Closest I can come to a texure is like cream of rice with a tapioca "feel".  Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because, well, I don't think of it as as stand-alone food.  I always add flavor to it / kind of like you do to oatmeal or rice.  Otherwise, its great.

review/summary: LOVE this cereal
review/text: I love to make this cereal with Almond milk. I have many many many food allergies, so this is a great alternative to oatmeal and other hot cereals. I have also used the flakes to make a cookie recipe. It's a little lighter than oatmeal and is super fast to cook once water boils--just add a little salt, sugar, and butter, yum!
