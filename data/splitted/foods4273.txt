review/summary: Great conversation piece
review/text: I used these at a party for a neurosurgeon. I was pleased with the speed of shipping and the product itself. The brains were a little smashed together and not as plump and colorful as another brand of gummy brain I'd purchased in the past (but were unavailable at this time). The flavor was good.

review/summary: Love These Cookies!
review/text: Amy's new gluten free shortbread cookies are Amazing! They have a rich, buttery taste that reminds me of the Pecan Sandies I used to eat when I was growing up, But without all the bad ingredients. Even my friends who are not on a gluten free diet LOVE them. Amy's products are all great, but they really out did themselves with their shortbread cookies, they are worth every penny!

review/text: These Almond shortbread cookies are so delicious it's hard not to eat an entire pack at one sitting. They have a  flavor reminiscent of the Chinese almond cookies. For those of us who loved those cookies, this is actually a better substitute. And if you loved shortbread cookies, these are made even better with the added almonds. My husband, who is not GF, said these are probably the best or second best cookies he's ever had.

review/summary: Great Tasting Cookies!!
review/text: My first experience with GF cookies.  Giving up the "regular" cookies, breads and pastas I love has been challenging, to say the least.  I purchased these cookies based on other reviews and I'm glad I did.  The taste, flavor and texture of these cookies is very good.  It was a bit disappointing that most of the cookies had broken, but I understand that's pretty common for GF baked goods, especially when they have to be shipped.  Nonetheless, they were good enough that none of the crumbles were wasted -- I just sprinkled them on top of vanilla ice cream and that was even better.  I most likely will order these again.  The package arrived quickly and in good shape with the cookies securely wrapped in plastic wrap over the paper-type cookie container.

review/summary: Great cookies if you like crumbs
review/text: I had previously tried these cookies from a local company but decided to order six packages along with some rice snaps that I have a hard time finding locally.  The cookies are great considering I limited to very specific ingredients and these were ones that were ok.  I had tried them before I ordered six boxes from Amazon from a local store.  When they arrived I immediately placed them in the freezer and opened a package up the next day and they were all,9 cookies to a box broken.  When the large box arrived with all my purchases it was opened.  I don't know whether during delivery they fell out, poor handling and poor packing but I am not happy having to spend $5.00 a box for cookies only to have crumbs.  I am very unhappy with this purchase due to the condition of the cookies.  The crackers remained whole but the cookies not so.

review/summary: Lots of okay matcha for amazing price
review/text: Matcha comes in many different grades. Make no mistake, you are not going to get a full pound of high-quality matcha for less than several hundred dollars.<br />This is not matcha for drinking; it is matcha for cooking, baking, and even adventurously powdering breakfast cereal and ice cream with. If you want the stuff used in a Japanese tea ceremony, plan to pay a minimum of a dollar a gram, but if you want a lot of decent matcha for other purposes at a good price, this is it.

review/summary: Culinary teas bulk matcha vs. "tea ceremony quality" matcha
review/text: I am new to matcha drinking, so was somewhat concerned re: customer comments Culinary Teas matcha being "brown" (i.e. a not the correct bright green color). I had only tried Starbucks Matcha (PLEASE BE ADVISED - it is very tasty, but probably because the number one ingredient on the label is sugar). Also, a pound of Starbucks Matcha (as sold on a popular auction site) costs about the same as a pound of Culinary Teas bulk Matcha)...so you are getting far less of the expensive and healthful green tea powder and more sugar (the Starbucks product is somehow micronized so it does mix into solution much easier than a less processed pure tea powder). The teaspoon on the right is Teavana (at $16 for 30 grams - thats 2 Tbsp) they said it was the highest "tea ceremony" quality matcha. The teaspoon on the left is the bulk (1 lb, silver bag) CT product. Photo taken without a flash and not retouched so actual colors show. CT matcha  is slightly less brilliant green. I mixed exact quantities (1/2 tsp) of matcha in 8 oz of liquid with exact quantities of sweetener (a blend of xylitol and stevia that I am experimenting with). The CT matcha tastes slightly less "green" and slightly more bitter than the Teavana, but I did the math ( a pound of CT would cost $240 at the Teavana $16 per 30 g cost) - so I am very happy with my CT purchase. Will use the smaller container for my "working" supply, freeze the rest and use as needed. Am finding Matcha to be a great substitute for my "too much coffee" habit and prefer the less instantaneous (but prolonged) energy boost it gives - not too mention alkalizing instead of acidifying, ECGC, and possible metabolism boosting effect.<br />PS Most Starbucks barristas do not know the Matcha powder contains sugar, so they will tell you the are not adding any. As consumers, we need to ask companies to STOP ADDING SUGAR (in whatever processed form it takes) to everything they make.

review/summary: Not great matcha, but for the price it's good for everyday use
review/text: It tastes good enough and is affordable enough to use every day. It's not sweet and super bright, almost-neon green like medium and high grade matcha, but it's not bitter, unpleasant, stale, and brownish like Malden's similarly priced matcha. It is only slightly more expensive than Malden's matcha ($3.40/oz. or $2.62/oz. in bulk vs. Malden's $2.50/oz) but the quality is superior. I highly recommend this as an overall good mathca at a really good price.<br /><br />If this is the first matcha you try you won't be disappointed. But if you're not impressed with the taste keep in mind that the next step up in quality available through Amazon is at around $10/oz (ex. DoMatcha's 2nd Harvest).

review/summary: Green tea powder for life!
review/text: At first glance it may seem that this product is somewhat expensive--$30+ for tea, right? But a pound of green tea powder is A LOT!!! For a 6 oz cup of tea or most other uses you only need to use about a half a teaspoon or things get a little strong and murky. But I add it to everything--my morning protein shake, yogurt, Gatorade for the gym, etc., etc. and still I have yet to make a dent in the bag. I have also looked at green tea powder at places like Whole Foods and Asian super markets, and this is a really good deal in comparison. So buy some and enjoy!

review/summary: You get what you pay for - Quality worth every penny spent
review/text: This product is everything you would expect, and then some. The shipping was fast. The Matcha is sent in a resealable, heavy-duty FOILED plastic bag, EXCELLENT quality. I recommend using a small tin for everyday use, taking no more than an ounce or two from the larger bag, to preserve the flavor and freshness.<br /><br />The taste is WONDERFUL. Very fresh, very green, very subtle, yet intense.<br />I purchased this product after Starbucks raised their prices (again!), because I had become a frozen green tea frappucino addict...Now I am just a Matcha addict.<br /><br />I love it in the evening warm, in a large mug with a good splash of milk, and simply adore it from the blender with milk, ice cubes, some vanilla syrup and a splash of whipping cream for the frothy, creamy taste...<br /><br />I use 2 level teaspoons, not packed, to a 20 oz. mug, so figure 1 teaspoon per "regular" coffee cup.<br /><br />The illustrative picture is what your matcha will look like. None of the other vendors show the color/quality of their product...For something like this, being able to see what you will get is half the issue. I can tell you that the flavor, which is the other half, is also the quality you would expect and wish for.

review/summary: Good but not quite starbucks
review/text: I bought this item based on the good reviews it got and for the price. I think this is a product that is more useful in baking than a hot tea - it seems to require a lot of careful mixing that is too much hassle for a quick cuppa. It was green and not brown like one of the reviews here stated. I just bought an ice cream maker and am planning to use it for that or just to add to my morning smoothie for a boost. I recently got a bag of the Starbucks version that is mixed with sugar and it blends very easily with hot water. They don't sell it in their stores in powder form like you can buy coffee, but I know enough people in the Starbucks biz to get it on a regular basis. I think I will stick with that version for a hot tea, but I think this 1lb bag is good value for my baking purposes. Hopefully the ice cream will be as good as I want it to be!

review/text: I go through a lot of matcha, and I've tried a lot of different kinds. No, this is not tea ceremony quality tea powder, but it is bright green and tastes great. It's a far cry from the brown matcha that the super-cheap stuff often is. It's even significantly better than cooking-grade matcha. This is great tea for in just about anything or alone in water, and cheap enough to make it inexpensive for daily use. Came properly sealed in a foil bag.

review/text: Considering the price of top grade Matcha I figured that this would be "good enough".  It is just that. It is good enough for everyday drinking, smoothies and cooking.  If you looking for top shelf, well then pay the high prices and get the best you can afford.  If you want second best I recommend DoMatcha's 2nd Harvest.  If you want cooking, smoothie or food grade matcha at an affordable price, ten this is the stuff. It is not brown. It is green.  Bright green no, but green.  Considering the price, the quick delivery and if you want to be able to afford to drink this at least twice a day, this is perfect.  No complaints.

review/text: Fast shipping, quality product in durable bag with ziplock. Good quantity and cheap. Good taste. The only drawbacks is that product is really difficult to dissolve. I like to make mine with vanilla soy milk, but I always have to stir out the powder in a small quantity of boiling water before adding the soy milk and then microwaving or steeming it. It still does not dissolve completely. Also this is a problem because green tea should be made with water that is about 60 degrees to preserve the best taste...  I would like for the color to be more like the color in the photo, but it is a much more muddy green color. Not like starbucks...but maybe that means it is more natural - I dunno.

The matcha came in neatly packaged with a note from the company who makes it.<br />Secondly, the first thing I did was to make a cold cinnamon matcha smoothie with 2% milk. It was delicious! The matcha is a deep green color and had a very fine grain, there was hardly a difference between this and ridiculously expensive "ceremonial grade" matcha. This matcha, as long as it is properly sifted and mixed properly, will make beautiful drinks.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more of this when I run out but that won't be for a while- I ordered the 8oz bag. :)<br /><br />I can't wait to make matcha sugar cookies, and mocha cupcakes with matcha frosting.

review/text: The matcha green tea powder had a great color too it. The packaging was in a large, sealed reflective foil bag with a label showing the manufacture's nutrition information. (Note: The bag was not resealable, so make sure you have a container to store it in after opening.)<br /><br />The tea itself was a nice green color, very close to what is pictured in the description. I did not find it having a brownish tint at all, unlike some of the reviews that I have seen on here. It was all green. I could not find a better price for 8 oz. of matcha tea powder.<br /><br />I personally started drinking matcha tea recently so I cannot determine how much better or worse it is compared to other brands. I do, however, have to say that I love the taste of this tea. I drink it unsweetened as both hot and iced tea. I also have successfully replicated great smoothie recipes and  an iced latte recipe from my favorite beverage establishments (this stuff has saved me so much $$$ in smoothies that it has already paid for itself.)<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product. I was even more impressed with how fast it arrived. I was expecting 7-10 business days for it to be shipped and arrive, but it was at my doorstep in 3 business days!

review/text: By looking for an affordable substitute to the big coffee chains, I found this. It's excellent and more healthy because it is not full of sugar like other powders. At first I kept making it WAAAAY too strong because I've tried many other types of powder that required 2-3 tbsp per cup. This powder is pure green tea and a little goes a long way. Because a little goes a long way, it is definitely worth paying a little more $$ for this product...the other ones might be cheaper but you need a lot more in your cup to make a good quality green tea latte.

I purchased this to drink every morning and to use in cooking and frappuccinos.  So far,  it is best for frappuccinos where the flavor is enhanced with plenty of sugar and Mimic Cream (almond, cashew cream substitute).<br />I would not recommend this product.  Either spend more or keep looking.  Good luck!

review/summary: Ok Matcha for the price
review/text: Tried matcha green tea powder for the first time and this one is actually not too bad.  It doesn't taste muddy and I taste the matcha green tea flavor.  So far, I've only tried this with hot water and as an ice tea. I will try it in smoothies next week.  Satisfied with the product and price but the only drawback is the packaging.  I cut a slit on the side and fold it after using, but a lot of the powder came out! So I had to pour it all in a tuber ware. You gotta change the packaging to a zip lock bag or something.  I wanted to order more but in the 16 oz, but the only thing stopping me is that there is a shipping fee AND it's sold by another company, why is that??

review/summary: high shipping, no cute tin, but great product
review/text: Bought to use in a cheesecake recipe that we've been enjoying for a year now using instant powder subsitutes...this is a reasonably-priced nice-sized sample to use. $5 shipping is a bit goofy for a soft 1-oz. packet of powder, but luckily I had a gift certificate. I look forward to trying different recipes with this. Cheesecake tastes good, a lot earthier/more organic now that we have the real matcha. I think I'll try making iced lattes now. Too bad it didn't come in the cute little round tin that they show it in...that was an appealing package but the resealable soft packet is nice too.

It only comes in a silver packaging, with a home-made looking logo on the bag. No Nutritional info, no ingredients. The communication was also very poor. took 2 emails befoe i got a response.

review/summary: Fresh and very good deal
review/text: The packaging of this spice is superior to other packaging methods I've experienced.  The color is vibrant and aroma excellent.  I've used this in rice dishes so far and plan to develop more ways to get it in my family's diet.  I've seen on many sites and in other reviews advice to use turmeric with oil (olive oil would probably be ideal) to aid absorption.  Absorption is the goal because this isn't just food; it's medicinal.<br /><br />The active ingredient is curcumin.  This product claims at least 5% curcumin.  Turmeric typically has a range of curcumin between 2% - 6%.  Curcumin is responsible for the dramatic and many health effects of this spice.  It helps against inflammation, diarrhea, arthritis and a lot more.  The one getting a lot of attention now is to aid against the prevention of Alzheimer disease.  There are studies on this so it's not official yet.  I guess it's semi-official if you think about all the doctors behind this movement and some statistics about populations that use turmeric.<br /><br />The spice is agreeable in many dishes in combination with other flavors.

review/summary: How Curcumin is Absorbed Properly
review/text: I bought some of Frontier's organic tumeric at our local health food store. Dr. Russel Blaylock, neurosurgeon and author of The Blaylock Wellness Report says tumeric must be mixed with an oil in order to be absorbed. He suggests olive oil or fish oil.<br /><br />Life Extension Foundations sells products like tumeric and they mix it with peperine (black pepper) for better absorption.<br /><br />PureBulk sells powders and it says about their product: "PureBulk offers an extract of turmeric which has been standardized to 95% curcuminoids (the active constituent in turmeric)."<br /><br />So I don't understand what the minimum 5% curcumin means on the Frontier product. Does it mean that PureBulk's product has 95% and this product only has 5% curcumin? Maybe someone could explain this.<br /><br />I have taken the Frontier's organic product for a couple days now and it seems to help brain inflammation. My brain was poisoned when a dentist drilled into a silver amalgam filling and let the mercury vapor go into my brain. You can google my name along with mercury to find out how to avoid toxic dentistry.<br /><br />PureBulk does not say their product is organic.

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: Frontier has never let me down in any of the spices I have ordered.  All of them are delivered fresh and quickly in resealable dark bags for longer freshness and flavor.  That being said, I would love to recommend Turmeric for many, many other reasons.  If you don't know the health benefits of Turmeric, please take a few moments to research them as there are many.  I use Turmeric for its anti inflammation properties and anti cancer properties.  It is helpful in weight loss and brain function as well as energy.  Currently I am using it in my dogs food daily.  He is an 11 year old French Bulldog who we just adopted from a shelter.  He came to us with seizures but now has a tumor growing on his mouth.  His doctor says at this point there isn't much we can do as it is most likely brain cancer.  After a few hours of crying I researched Turmeric and dogs and found that many tumors have been reduced by adding a Tbs. or more in their food daily.  I've been doing it for about a week and is really does look much better.  Knock on wood this will help him.  I've been drinking Turmeric in my water with cayenne pepper, ginger, lemon juice and aloe vera for quite a while and I've never felt better.  I use it to keep my hands pain free.  I am a massage therapist who does deep tissue and I really have to keep inflammation out of my body.  Great product, great price and phenomenal company to purchase from.

review/text: I received this before the estimated shipping date.  Excellent service.  I have been using this product for almost a month now.  It is not organic but Non-radiated.  I wanted the 5% curcumin so that's why I opted for the non-organic.  The taste is wonderful, better than the store bought Turmeric. My mother who is 80, has noticed that she has been able to sleep through the night.  Her shooting pain that runs down her legs used to keep her up at night has gone.  She has more energy, better digestion and less brain-fog.  My husband has diabetes & a cholesterol problem.  We will know about that on his next blood work.  In all I was very satisfied with the service and the product.  I would purchase again.

review/text: Big disappointment, as I bought three one-pound bags.  I have always thought of ground turmeric as yellow in color, and indeed the product description page for this product says, "Our ground turmeric has a wonderful, golden-yellow color and a pungent, distinctive aroma."  As the color is not yellow, but brown, and the aroma is mild, not pungent, I assume this product is stale.  I contacted another herb vendor who confirmed turmeric should be a yellowish color.  I would rate one star but the packaging was very good.

review/text: Athough I haven't used the product yet, the color and smell of the turmeric appears and smells good.  I like that it is non-irradiated and certified organic.  There is a lot in the 3 foil bags. I poured one bag in a quart glass jar and there was about a cup left over that wouldn't go into the jar.  It has 5% curcumin and so far haven't found a bulk product with more percentage curcumin than that at this reasonable cost.  I believe the curcumin content is strong anti inflammatory properties.  If the total turmeric does this, I haven't heard.  But I like to have the bulk for cooking.  When I can afford, I take other curcumin supplements for the anti inflammatory benefits as well.

review/summary: Luna goes bonkers for Halo salmon treats
review/text: My kitty, Luna, loves these treats so much that she paws at the fridge door, hoping to get at them.  She's older and has a bad heart, so I like that she's getting her Omega 3s and that she's eating only pure, natural treats.  They also facilitate giving her pills; if she won't eat the pill wrapped in cheese, or whatever, I rub some of the dried salmon around the cheese, and voila...she'll usually eat the whole thing.  Then I'll reward her with a bit more salmon. It's pricey, but because it's only for occasional treats, I feel it's the least I can do for her years of devotion.

Good luck finding any cat treat that doesn't have chicken or chicken meal in it. These pure salmon treats were the only thing I could find, and thank goodness, my cat LOVES them! She purrs when I get out the container, and barely lets me break them up into her bowl before eating them. I usually get little salmon crumbs all over her head because she will shove her way in there...even when we open the fridge, she tries to poke her head in there to see if she can find them :) I've found that it is really important when raising a cat to be able to reward them for good behavior. Positive reinforcement is the key, and I wouldn't be able to do that without these treats. Thank you Halo! The salmon sprinkles are also great for encouraging them to eat wet food if it's not their favorite thing.

review/summary: Light & sweet. Made with natural cane sugar.
review/text: I love this and the other varieties of Hawaiian Sun green teas.  In fact I tend to hoard them and drink them sparingly.  One reason they are so good is that they aren't nearly as sweet as other canned teas or soft drinks.  This is not only nice for a change, but it allows the other flavors to be expressed evenly.  In this case that means Lychee and Ginseng both of which are very present, but neither of which is overpowering.<br /><br />When poured into a glass, this tea is a very light, pale green color.  I prefer to drink it cold or over ice.  I drink it all year long but it's the best in the warmer months.  I have it with whatever meals normally go well with iced tea and it always works great.<br /><br />I also really like that it is made with minimal ingredients and natural cane sugar.  It does have HFCS listed as an ingredient as well but at least it's not sweetened with pure corn syrup.  The sweetness of the Lychee comes through too and all in all this is a very subtle and delicately sweet flavor.

review/text: Due to the sugar cover on these, they begin with a crisp sweet taste. Although none of the 4 colors offer any specific flavor, if your looking for candy you are looking for sweetness which these offer the perfect balance of. Additionally, these gummis do not fall into the two major pitfall of non-Haribo gummis: 1) a weird aftertaste, and/or 2) makes you feel kinda nauseous after about 1/2 a pound of them at a time. Altogether, although these were nothing extra ordinary, they were soft, tasty, and, most importantly, RIDICULOUSLY CHEAP.

Nothing really stood out and I have a great sense of smell and super taste buds. They had a sugar coating on the outside that didn't add anything special to the flavor just made a mess. Was not a big fan but was stuck with 9lbs of them. They are finally gone however next time I will be ordering their regular 12 flavors gummi bears.

But they are crisp and dry, much more like a Famous-Amos style. The flavor is decent, but when you bite into one you are covered in crumbs because of how crisp they are.<br /><br />If you are looking for a soft, chewy gluten free cookie, I recommend the refrigerated dough from Immaculate Baking Company. I found them at Whole Foods and they're pretty darn close to the texture you would get with a gluten cookie.<br /><br />Again, there's really nothing wrong with these cookies, per se, they just weren't at all what I was looking for.

We are down to our last two chiplets and Maggie Moo really wants more, so, I tried the website, but the website was lame and didn't show the Mint chiplets for sale.  So I tried Amazon and of course, they had them at a pretty reasonable price.  It's nice to know that I don't have to run around to lots of different store to purchase these again.  By the way, not only does my dog literally "flip" for these snacks, they are all natural, freshens her doggy breath, and has only 6 ingredients: beef liver, whole wheat flour, wheat bran, charcoal?, peppermint oil and water.  Im not sure what the charcoal is for...?

review/text: I've tried almost every microwave popcorn available anywhere to find the perfect balance of flavor, oil and salt. Overly salted popcorn -- overly salted food in general -- is unpalatable to me.  Sodium listings are misleading and erroneous.  Most grocery store-bought popcorn has too much salt and poor quality control, even if low sodium numbers are listed in the nutrition information. Pop's Corn Light Butter, on the other hand, delivers.  First, I tried Pop's Corn Unsalted.  Normally I would prefer it, but it tasted like cardboard and I tossed all of the boxes out.  I was pleasantly surprised that the Light Butter is indeed very lightly salted, and very lightly oiled.  Unfortunately palm oil, but this is almost impossible to avoid in any microwave popcorn.  In short, this is the best I've found.

review/summary: Popcorn for the Popcorn Connoisseur
review/text: I'm a popcorn addict.  When I'm trudging through town and catch the scent of popcorn I become completely focused on popcorn, butter and popcorn salt (not the corser table salt.) Rich white and gold crunchy puffs.  I need popcorn and I need it now.  In such a frenzied state of mind the worst thing to do is give me terrible popcorn.  I'll remember, like my worst enemy ever, anyone who would promise mana and deliver rubbish.  When I go to the theatre for a show I'm buying popcorn and bringing my personal salt shaker containing fine popcorn salt.  I'm going to enjoy my popcorn, every last morsel.  It's all about the Popcorn Experience.<br /><br />So with the Microwave Oven came the marvel of Microwave Popcorn.  Early attempts were poor, even embarrassingly bad.  The smell of the heated bag was unpleasant, like plastic left on on a hot stove.  The flavouring was entirely unlike butter, more like motor oil and it often had far too much salt.  Latter attempts were to paper over the shortcomings with Extreme Popcorn, caked in gookum, smelling like melted crayons and giving me headaches.  No thanks.<br /><br />I tried several brands and most fell far short of what even the grimyest theatre popcorn maker and soak of high-profit-oil could produce.  I remained bound to the finer theatres (those who still used genuine butter and popcorn salt) for my fix.<br /><br />So one day I'm pushing my cart around the local food mart and espy Pop's Corn.  I'm rather put-off by microwave popcorn, but on a whim I figure it's worth one more go.  The scent of the bag isn't bothersome, the rich steam suggests this will be a better experience and the taste, well, just enough salt and a Popcorn Experience the finest theatre would boast of!  At last, a conventient popcorn delivery which accomplishes such a simple task without muck or bother.  Well done!

review/text: We used to LOVE this popcorn. Seriously love it...2-3 bag per night consumption between my family members (x 5 days a week)...Healthy, perfectly light in salt and butter...<br /><br />But a few months ago, something changed.<br /><br />What used to be the best popcorn on the market has suddenly morphed into a mess. Besides the fact that the popcorn itself is no longer big, fluffy kernels, the biggest problem is the amount of hulls. There are so many hulls, we have to rinse our mouths out after eating...<br /><br />I hardly have ever even noticed hulls in popcorn before... but these are hard and there are way too many per kernels of corn. It is not just an annoyance, it really degrades the popcorn...<br /><br />So sad...how could they ruin a perfect product like that...?<br /><br />Since then, we've discovered Pop Weaver Light Butter and although it's not as good as the Old Newman's, it's five million times better than the new version!

review/summary: the only popcorn we eat!
review/text: love this popcorn, just a hint of butteriness and not too salty. definitely not artificial tasting-because there is nothing artificial in it! that's why we eat it. popcorn has good fiber, and is a healthy snack not ful of white flour or sugar.

review/summary: Other organic is better!
review/text: I really enjoy organic foods, so when I came upon this item I was thrilled they were making organic popcorn- especially Newman's Own, a brand I've liked in the past.  I have to agree with the other poster, the popcorn is bland and almost flavorless.  There are other brands of organic popcorn that I've found more recently that are far better.  Don't waste your money on such a vast amount of product!!!  I would suggest even making your own popcorn- it is still going to be healthier than this and you can flavor as you like so it will taste much better than this!

review/summary: Good popcorn
review/text: Good popcorn, good price.  Only complaint is that it seems to leave more unpopped that other comparable brands. Otherwise, no complaints.

review/summary: Fantastic Healthy Snack
review/text: I originally got this popcorn at a local grocery, but found myself buying it almost weekly, so decided to purchase in bulk here on Amazon to save a bit on cost and time. I found I could save about $0.30 to $0.50 a box. The case of twelve boxes lasts me 2-3 months, which is well withing the shelf life of the popcorn. The case I received in February 2011 had an expiry date of September 21, 2011.<br /><br />I have a 1000w microwave, and it cooks in about 120-150 seconds, and burns in about 180 seconds. It has a light corn flavor, is not heavily salted, and has a nice crisp texture that makes it a joy to eat.

review/summary: Tastes like old fashioned popcorn
review/text: I am delighted with my new Pop's corn.  I eat a bag of popcorn just about every day at work because it's only 2 weight watcher's points and it takes a long time to eat, and is relatively healthy.  I had been buying a different brand but decided to try Newman's Own because 1) it's organic and 2) the ActII was often good but occasionally not so good, so the quality control was questionable.  Anyway, I have only had about 5 bags of this but so far it's very good.  I like my popcorn slightly browned (much to the chagrin of my coworkers sometimes) because it improves the texture of it for me, but I am happy to report I like this popcorn without "burning" it because it pops up light and fluffy.  So I recommend it.
