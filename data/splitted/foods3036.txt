review/summary: A Touch of Something Special
review/text: At long last found a recipe long ago published with my favorite baker's recipe for Anzac cookies. This was called for and although I could only find it online, made a very nice difference as a sweetener. The cookie was everything that I had remembered.  Also tried this along with a little maple syrup on waffles... it was great!

review/summary: Syrupy goodness!
review/text: I love it - best on toast with butter, but almost as good drizzled into porridge. Have also bought "The Lyle's Golden Syrup Cookbook" and experimented with using it to make kebabs and smoothies which were great. Has anyone tried the Maple Flavoured Syrup? Not 'true' Maple syrup but my boyfriend actually prefers the Lyle's version! Can't find it to buy in the US though.

review/text: I would have liked, first, if this product could be bought in Mexico City. If so, the distributor, the cost.  If not possible to buy it in this City, the alternatives to do so.  How can it be used, if recipes come with it because this golden syrup is like no other.  It has a really peculiar taste that makes it the best of all syrups.

review/text: You know you've got a good product when you can use it for your hair and then use it for your body and for a pizza dish. This is a versatile product from a company my family has trusted for quite some time. The oil is not only yummy but oh-so-good for the hair of anyone who has issues with dryness. I deep condition with it and also use it in a "shealoe" mix before styling my hair. It has not failed me yet. It has lasted me about four months and I'm just now in need of a new bottle. A little bit truly goes a long way.

review/summary: WARNING:  Possible Molar Erosion
review/text: Before I became addicted to these, my teeth were in very good shape, with very few cavities.  I started eating one box of these a week, for about 16 months.  During that time, I experienced severe molar erosion (back bottom molars), of up to 1/8" or so.  When the corners of the molars started to break off (they're crunchy, so you tend to notice), I knew I was in trouble.  Did some research and found that sours can be very bad for your teeth.  I had to have caps installed on four molars.  If you try these, I'd recommmend NOT gettng addicted to them, and limiting use.  I can't be positive that this is what caused the problem, but I quit using them after the dental problems, and the molar erosion has stopped.

review/summary: Dangerous, do not give to kids!
review/text: I started buying these candies recently because my dentist told me to stop chewing gum. I usually have one driving home from work. The other day I was waiting for my husband to go out to dinner and I was starving so I had three. Big mistake. The third one burnt my tongue. Literally took the skin off. My tongue bled while I slept that night, I woke up with a throat coated with blood. Then it scabbed over and now the scabs are slowly peeling away, so I have dead skin kind of hanging off the middle of my tongue that I am afraid to remove because I don't want to start bleeding again.<br /><br />I've never in my life had this happen with any other candy. I recommend staying away from these!!!!

review/summary: Worst Sardine Product on the Market - Bar None.
review/text: I wish I had seen other peoples comments before purchasing this product.  Every review I have seen on the net the reviewers have all noted and complained about the same thing... and it's true.  There are fish scales embedded in the fish, and I'll add bones to the list of unwanted 'crustaceans' in this garbage food.  It is hard to put in words just how bad this product really is.  After choking down 4 different bags of this stuff, I gave up on them.  It took weeks before I could give 'sardines' another try (not this stuff.. no!).  I have 4 unused pouches left and it still gags me physically even thinking I ate these. I wrote Crown Prince directly complaining and received back a notice that the cannery was 'crushing' the fish instead of 'scaling' them!  I was to be on the lookout for a new pouch that reads:  "New and Improved!"  Are you kidding me??  I cannot believe they actually are going to keep stocking store shelves with this product!  Amazon you are doing your customers a disservice by offering these for sale... I kid you not... This stuff should have been pulled from the market as inedible a month after hitting store shelves.  Now, If you're a sea-faring mermaid or merman, these are for you!  Plenty of 'Whole' fish goodness in those pouches!  But if not, my advise is don't bother trying them... I bet even my cat wouldn't have eaten them!  ;p

review/text: Crown Prince needs to clean up its act because when you buy this product, you get more garbage than sardine. I found scales, sand and stuff I could not even identify. From that, there were two small sections of some kind of fish. Why the USDA even allows this into our country is beyond me. This is a horrible product. Fully recommend King Oscar brand.

review/summary: My favorite flavored coffee, but could be stronger
review/text: I love this stuff. I've tried many, many flavored coffee k-cups over the 5+ years I've had a Keurig machine. This is far and away my favorite flavor, the one I either always have or keep coming back to. I find it does taste like what it says, vanilla and caramel. Most times I use minimal sweetener and creamer, but other times I add a bit more of each to achieve a more dessert-like taste.<br /><br />That said, I wish this were a stronger brew. It wouldn't need to be a dark brew but would be better if it wasn't so light.<br /><br />For now, I'll keep buying and enjoying this until I find something better. Currently, the other flavors I'm using are Island Coconut and Chocolate Donut Shop, but these vary over time to Pumpkin Spice, Wild Mt. Blueberry (also could be a bit stronger), and others.

I recall ordering from OS years ago, receiving fabulous fillets that could be easily cut with a fork-this was not the case. For the price, I will likely have better luck requesting special cuts from the local supr market.

review/text: I received a Christmas gift coupon to Amazon, and decided to splurge on The Fantastic Feast. Everything in it was beyond expectations.  The hot dogs were the best we have ever had. They are HUGE!  So tasty too.  The stuffed sole was better than restaurant fare.  Great juicy beefy burgers.  I wasn't expecting much of the chicken breasts, I figured boneless chicken breast is boneless chicken breast... but they were unbelievably moist and delicious.  The center cut pork chops were flavorful and juicy!  Of course the sirloin steaks were wonderful as well, and the potatoes were a quick and delicious side.  So much in that magical cooler!  The quality of Omaha Steak products is truly exceptional.  I would not hesitate to purchase one of the combo packs again.  My only negative is that the shipping prices are high. I was actually ordering 8 hot dogs earlier today for 9.99 and they wanted 14.99 for shipping!  I decided against that purchase... Money is tight, and lower shipping costs would help us all out!  Fortunately for me there is a retail store nearby my home, which I plan on visiting soon!

review/summary: AWESOME gift!
review/text: I ordered this sampler for my aunt for christmas.  I called her after they arrived and she was THRILLED!  She said they are delicious, and also commented on what a wonderful gift idea.  She lives alone, and in another state, so this was the perfect gift and size for her!  She can even invite a friend over to enjoy with her.  I just ordered a larger Rib Eye package for my husband and myself to enjoy!  I can't wait to receive it.

review/summary: so disappointed ~ will not order Omaha steaks again
review/text: I finally decided to order a variety package deal knowing I could get stuffed sole (scallops and crabmeat) with steaks as well as various other things. Tried the steaks first and while I was disappointed with the size I do say they are way more properly portioned than what I usually get. They are quite thin and are okay at best but definitely not worth the money. Next we tried the potatoes au gratin and I liked that they were different than the sliced stuff in a casserole dish I remember having as a kid (never liked them before) but these were potato balls and while they looked really good they fell short of what I was expecting and my expectations were not that high. One of those deals where the first bite is pretty good and it just goes down hill from there ~ by the time I was done with the first one I didn't care to eat the second one. They seemed like processed frozen food rather than a gourmet type item. I had just always thought "Ohama Steaks" and figured for the price everything would be that of a high-end steakhouse in quality but it isn't even in the ball park of a high-end steakhouse.<br /><br />So... what has prompted me to finally write (I wasn't going to) was tonight I tried the stuffed sole. I had one a while back "just to see" and while it seemed really bland it was so-so, so I thought I'd prepare a side dish (my own mashed potatoes) with it this time and give it another shot. (I'm a nut for anything crab and scallop.) Being hungry I baked 2 of them. Again I was disappointed with how bland it was but when I started finding BONES in my mouth that was it. BOTH of them had little bones.<br /><br />It was obviously a waste of time and money and I don't even care about the rest of the food. I may try to see if I can give it away. I am simply not interested and having paid that much money for this stuff and it tasting like some cheap clearance item, not to mention the BONES!! That is just not acceptable to me. I'm glad it wasn't one of my kids eating it.<br /><br />I would have left this review on their website but, oh my, I couldn't find a page to do that on their website. I wonder why??

review/summary: A very unique candy!
review/text: Oh I love this cady! I i am 22 and discovered them when I was probably 10 or 12. They were discontinued in about 1999 and haven't seen them since. They are a fizzing disc like an alka seltzer designed to make a drink when added to water. Be aware that these are made with sorbitol (a artificial sweetner) so when you add it to water...you taste this diet after taste. Fizzies, I guess have been around for like 50 years! But remember they have ALWAYS been made with artificial sweetner, and I looked it up and a chemist said you would have to because the ratio to the other ingrediants would have to make the fizzie as big as a hockey puck if it was sugar!!!  LOL, this is why I eat them by just putting them in my mouth and suck on them lol!! Its perfectly safe and won't harm you (i know this because I a an RN) Even if you swallow it whole you will just get a nice case of gas. Whe u suck on the tablet whole, or just lick it it tastes like sugar and a pleasent orange taste that is very nice and flavorful all with no calories! I also have to say that the fizzies now are haped different than what they used to be in 1994 when I bought them, they used to be VERy thick, almost like a stack of 4 or 5 nickels. Now, they are the thickness of two quarters but much more of a circumfrance, so I guess there is the same amount of candy there. The flavor I believe is identical, but I wouldnt know for sure unless I could compare them both. I am still glad I got them, and I rated them 5 stars and bought the big 12 pack!!! I highly suggest trying this, just buy the smaller package. ALSO W-A-R-N-I-N-G!!!!!<br />  ONLY BUY ORANGE!!! THE OTHER<br />  FLAVORS ARE AWEFUL!!! RESIST<br />  THE URGE TO TRY OTHER FLAVORS<br />  I PROMISE YOU, THEY ARE BAAAAAD!!<br />  ORANGE IS THE BEST ORANGE FLAVORING<br />  IF YOU LIKE ORANGE TIC TACS TRY THESE!

review/summary: Fun Stuff
review/text: One fizzie for 6 oz. of water is about right.  If you use a big glass, use more fizzies.<br /><br />It does have the artificial sweetener taste to it, but our kids love this stuff.  I bought them years ago, and they have asked for them regularly ever since.  The place I bought them no longer carries them and it FINALLy occured to me to check Amazon, and here they are!<br /><br />The biggest problem your kids will have is waiting for the fizzie to finish fizzing before drinking it to get the full flavor.  They will want to drink it while it is still fizzing.  That's how kids are.<br /><br />You would buy this instead of some other kid drink because, well, it fizzes and makes itself!  That's the fun of it.<br /><br />You get 6 boxes with 12 fizzies in each box.  Each fizzie is individually wrapped.<br /><br />Orange does seem to be the best working flavor.

review/summary: "Classic" is much better!
review/text: I agree with some of the other reviewers (for the NON-Classic syrup). I have been buying this product, mostly to add to coffee, for several years. At some point, I noticed that the flavor changed, and (to my palate at least), it was a change for the worse. After noticing some of the recent reviews, I made sure to order the "Classic" flavor when my supply started to run low. When it arrived, I taste-tested vs. the "non-Classic" syrup that I still had on hand, and (again, to my palate), the "Classic" tasted far superior. I suppose other people may prefer the new flavor, but for me, the Classic is the one I'll order from now on.

review/summary: Some Non-Lemon-Flavored Napoleons are Lemons
review/text: I've been a fan of Napoleon Lemon sours for ages, so I decided to give the assorted candies a try.  What a disappointment!  The citrus flavors (lemon, lime and orange) are delicious, but most of the others are, to my taste, mediocre or yucky (the cherry seems like medicine to me).  The seven-pound minimum quantity means that I'm stuck with a whole lot of candies that will never get eaten (unless guests pick them from the bowl on my coffee table).  Would not purchase again -- although I would buy the non-lemon Napoleon flavors if individual flavors, not the assorted mix, were sold.

review/text: I just completed my sixth and final round of chemotherapy and I found that I was constantly craving something 'sour'.  I discovered the Napolean candies at a candy shop on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco and bought two pounds of them.  That was on Feb 28th and I have maybe two or three left and I was already starting to panic until I decided to check on Amazon!  I'll be placing my order in a day or two.  These candies are awesome and I love the many flavors that are available esp the cherry.  Worth every penny!  Delicious!!

review/text: If you expect a sugar rush from this bread like most breads give you, you will be disappointed.  If you have given up eating most breads because of the high glycemic index/sugar rush, and all flour turns to sugar in your body, (this includes pasta, etc.) then this is an alternative.  It is about 100x better for you not only in the lower index but also the content of the flourless bread. If you ate a lot of fresh made sourdough yesterday and eat this today, it will be different.  Put a little good sweet balsamic vinegar and a tiny bit of good extra virgin olive oil and it is good and fantastic nutrition.

review/summary: Wheat Gluten Now An Ingredient
review/text: This is written by the spouse of John. I was a frequent buyer of Ezekiel bread. I have probably purchased and consumed more than 300 loaves. I do not have celiac disease, but I do have gluten sensitivity and this bread worked for me for years. I was just going to start using it again after a 4-month elimination diet and discovered that it now has wheat gluten!! This is very disappointing. The only gluten free product by this company that I've tried (GF English Muffins) were awful. I tried one and threw away the package. It felt like a I swallowed a rock of goo. My gut hurt for a couple days and I ended up needing to do special remedies for acute constipation :( Additionally, their regular English muffins have barley malt, which I avoid because of my gluten sensitivity. Clearly this company has lowered their ingredient standards to cut costs and make their product more appealing to a larger market, which will not include me.<br />Disappointed.

There must have been some clerical error that allowed this product to make it to store shelves despite (surely) having failed focus group trials.  I'm stupefied, really.<br /><br />Furthermore, the directions are poorly worded and leave out the step for adding a seasoning packet.  This has to be an accident.

review/text: This is by far one of the worst products I have ever tried.  The lemon flavor is so strong and sweet, it's almost impossible to taste anything else.  My family really likes lemon chicken, which lead us to think this might be a good option for a quick meal on one of those busy days.  Couldn't have been more wrong!  I agree with a previous poster - not sure how this flavor got past a test panel.  I was reaching for ANYTHING else on the table to get the taste out of my mouth.  Save your money and stick with something safe like the cheesy mac flavor.  This one will surely disappoint.

I don't know if Betty Crocker was aiming for Italian, or Oriental, or what. It came with two seasoning packets. The first one wasn't so bad, it's the one you add later, the "glaze" that really ruined the dish. The "glaze" tastes exactly like lemon pudding mix. So the end result was a salty chicken casserole with a hint of sweet lemon meringue pie. No thanks!

review/summary: UNCANNY! Must Buy! Must Have! With Kids or Without Kids!
review/text: Amazing! When you can't have a campfire and you've got the craving for S'mores, Pepperidge Farms had created an awesome FUN FISH!<br />Zany as Zany can be - Vanilla Gold Fish, Chocolate Goldfish, and of course - Marshmallow Goldfish - Stack'em up; but make sure<br />you hide your evidence if you want these to be ALL YOURS or otherwise they'll be gone before you get a chance to be a "kid at<br />heart"! Having bought two bags... thinking I would like these very much (how right I was!)...<br /><br />I was downright impressed, while not the traditional S'mores - but gee whiz; I actually ate the whole danged bag in one sitting<br />without even realizing it! *blush*  It was so much fun hunting or is it fishing (?) for one after another and then stacking them<br />together and eating "fishbait" - hahahahahaha!<br /><br />Next day, began to open the other bag (already!) and started to munch away ....<br /><br />Until, my grandchildren saw the "evidence" and wahhh :( - Poor Grandma here - ended up having to "share" and goodness gracious,<br />the laughter and giggles from the little ones were far worth it all!<br /><br />I 10,000 times recommend this ... this is the best ever from Pepperidge Farms! Way to go! Now if they can come up with the big box,<br />I'd buy it on Amazon in a heartbeat! Who would ever dream that Pepperidge Farms would come up with this? Just awesome!<br /><br />Interestingly, the very next day; while I had to babysit the youngest grandchild for a short time; she went off looking for something<br />that I had to inquire what she was looking for and she kept saying Whitey, Blackie and Creamy.  Looking everywhere in my room even<br />under the bed, leaving me totally bewildered until she sulked and said<br /><br />"Grandma, where did you hide them?"<br /><br />"Hide what?"<br /><br />"The 3 goldfishies"<br /><br />(puzzled)<br /><br />"The 3 Goldfishes? We don't have Goldfish in the house."<br /><br />(now she is mad with her arms folded)<br /><br />"Yes we do, we ate them yessteday! Grandma, where did you hide them?"<br /><br />(trying not to laugh)<br /><br />"Sweetie, we ate them all up yesterday."<br /><br />"Grandma, buy more. I like them lots! Tummy hungry, says want more goldfish."<br /><br />(points to her stomach)<br /><br />Kids are adorable! &lt;3  If you buy them, make sure you stash some for yourself, they are completely<br />and you just cannot resist them!

review/text: First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.

As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

review/summary: Healthy, yes. Easy to chew, no.
review/text: Like the previous reviewer, I also purchased these snack bars because they don't contain the usual bugaboos: high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, artificial sweeteners, etc. However, they're mighty hard to chew. And that's *probably* a good thing.<br /><br />I'm a hardcore fan of Quaker Oats granola bars, because they're a quick snack and they're heavy-laden with sugar, but they also have the HFCS (bad, bad) and hydrogenated oils (bad, bad, BAD). However, they are easy to chew. I am striving to slowly back away from the QO granola bars because of their unhealthy and lengthy ingredient list.<br /><br />The Kashi brand snacks are agreeable to the palate and they do have enough sugar for my personal tastes, but I have a couple crowns and I wonder if my over-priced prosthetic teeth can survive this healthy eating experience.<br /><br />That being said, these are the snacks of choice for long car trips. For one, I'll never pig out on them and two, they're good for the tummy. They provide a little energy boost and they're high octane fuel for this four-layer bio-suit we call a human body.

review/summary: Great taste, filling & healthy snack
review/text: I keep a box of these in my office - where I might be prone to eat a whole bag of candy with mindless snacking. Instead, one of these Crunchy Kashi bars is the perfect mid-afternoon snack. Like the other reviewers, I am trying my best to avoid the high fructose corn syrup. They still have close to 200 calories (170 for the 2 bars in a package, I believe), so it's not a "free" food for dieters. It should be planned into the daily caloric intakes. Still, it is a far more filling and satisfying snack than most other 200-calorie expenditures. It's really great in keeping me from snacking while fixing the evening dinner. I agree they are crunchy, but not to the dental risk others have suggested. And I think they're yummy. The pumpkin and spice flavor are pretty subdued. For those that like a nutty, "natural" taste, try these.

review/summary: Are you in for a mega-crunch?
review/text: Kashi means it when they say crunchy: these granola bars definitely pack a big crunch--but a little too hard though, I think. Don't get me wrong, they taste great--pumpkin seeds, flax grains, and pumpkin-pie spices are a great flavor blend.  I just worry about chipping a tooth eating these; they're unusually hard to bite down on and chew.  At least that makes them take some time to eat, which helps with portion/appetite control.  Tough texture aside, the ingredients don't raise any obvious red flags (no HFCS, hydrogenated oils, etc), and there's nothing heat sensitive about them, so I'll definitely keep them in mind when I need a small snack for the road.

review/text: These taste great and have a lower sodium content than many fast food items. Great for mid-morning or afternoon snack with coffee. They can be rather hard but I soaked them a bit by dipping in my coffee or milk like a cookie and it solved the problem. They remind me of ginger snaps which I soak in milk when eating. Great price for the 12 pack and calorie count and ingredients is so much better than cookies.

review/summary: Tastiest of the kashi bar line in my opinion!
review/text: Okay, so most of the kashi items are, in my opinion, hard to compare to other mainstream less healthy options, these however, have almost the exact same texture as the nature valley granola bars. They are definitely crunchy and a bit messy. I actually, for ease of eating purposes, whack my still wrapped/sealed bars against the counter so that the individual pack breaks into smaller/bite size pieces. This makes it easier to eat these, because biting into the bars is a little challenging (yes, they are THAT crunchy!) That being said, the flavor of these bars and the nice contrasting textures of seeds and grains is quite satisfying and delicious. If you like hearty, pumpkin, fall spice type of foods this is definitely for you. I would note however, the extreme crunchiness of these bars may not be conducive to someone who has a hard time chewing, and/or beware, as the grains/seeds have a tendency (not unlike popcorn hulls) to stick in teeth, maybe not great for anyone with dentures/braces. Also, something to note, if you are buying kashi items in bulk be prepared to eat a lot of them and quickly as the expiration dates are usually no more than 2 or 3 months past purchse (afterall these don't have all the chemicals/preservatives of your typical quick foods) All in all though, these are definitely my favorite of the kashi bars in terms of flavor!

review/text: I noticed that a lot of people have commented that the bars they received were stale and old.<br /><br />Fortunately I did not have that problem and the case I received has an expiration date of March, 2013 (I purchased them in August 2012).<br /><br />As to taste, its such a subjective thing and I'd advise anyone to try something from their local grocer before buying it by the case on Amazon.  That said, if you like this product, you too are probably dismayed that it has become hard to find at your local grocer, and excited to find it on Amazon.<br /><br />In my opinion, these are better bars than Nature's Valley granola bars.  That is NOT a knock on Nature's Valley bars though - their bars are excellent too (especially the peanut butter flavor), I just prefer the taste of these for my individual tastes.  The fact that they are "all natural" only helps.

review/summary: No calorie-count trickery
review/text: These granola bars come in packages of two bars and there is no calorie-count trickery involved: A serving is 2 bars and the total calorie count for both bars is 170. My absolute favorite special treat is a Tear-N-Share package of peanut M&Ms. The package is technically supposed to be 2 servings, but I eat it all by myself and rack up 480 calories. The granola bars fill me up just as much as the candy, so why don't I eat them instead?<br /><br />While I do not have a problem with the hardness of these granola bars, they are one of messiest snacks I have ever eaten. Try as I might, it is impossible not to get crumbs all over the place when you bite into them. I feel I can only enjoy them while leaning over the sink or outside, but under those conditions they are quite satisfying.

review/text: I had bought these yesterday at Ralph's, about $3.99, pretty average for a box of Kashi bars. I was looking really forward to having them as a snack today. I had read the reviews about how hard they are, yes, they're hard, but about the same hardness as a Nature's Valley bar. The taste is great, pumpkin pie does come to mind, but these remind me of ginger snaps more. In each individually wrapped package are two thin (but not too thin) pieces. Pretty enjoyable, and most importantly, the nutritional value is good if trying to maintain weight. Better than a Quaker Oat granola bar. Totally recommend.

review/summary: DELICIOUS!!!
review/text: I just received these bars and inhaled one in about a nanosecond, that's how good they are.  Also I guess I'm a bit perplexed by the comments on how hard they are.  It clearly says they are "crunchy", which they are, but are no crunchier than the "Nature Valley Oats and Honey" bars that I am also a fan of.  They are crunchy because they don't have all the fat in them so it's a great pay-off as far as I'm concerned.  I couldn't be happier, they are a quick, easy, healthy snack.  YUM!

review/summary: enjoyable snack.
review/text: Pumpkin Spice is the one and only Kashi TLC flavour that I've tried, and I'm sticking to it. Growing up I've always preferred asian snacks for not being too sweet nor salty and their deliciousness, but I can say this goes toe to toe with the MSG laden rice crackers, flavour-wise, and surpasses them in the health arena. Yes, they are on the hard/crunchy side, but as others said -- that might be a good thing. I took these snowboarding with me, and I felt great the whole day. It's hard to find pumpkin food products, so people who love pumpkin will probably appreciate this.

review/summary: CRUMBS!
review/text: Love this stuff, especially the pumpkin flavor. I keep a box in the car, one at home, and the rest at work. Small problem: only about half of the bars are intact when I get them from Amazon! Despite the packaging being immaculate, some of the pouches are filled with crumbs instead of "bar". I'm thinking the brittle lot got sold to Amazon? This is difficult to eat while driving along on the highway (we all do it, no time for breakfast). Fortunately, they're too good to care about crumbs when at home or work ;)<br />Four stars.

review/summary: Healthy + Tasty = Pumpkin Spice Flax Bars
review/text: These pumpkin spice and flax granola bars have to be one of the best crunchy granola bars around! Here's some things I like best about them:<br /><br />- they're cholesterol-free AND trans fat-free<br />- each bar has 6 grams of protein AND 300 milligrams of Omega-3s<br />- they're individually wrapped so you can easily take them along when running or  exercising<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P4Y8KO">Kashi TLC Crunchy Granola Bar,  Pumpkin Spice Flax, 1.4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> have it all- great nutrition and great taste, so if you're into granola, give them a try- you won't be disappointed.
