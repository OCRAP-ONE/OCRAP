review/summary: Not exactly what I had hoped for...
review/text: I was really looking forward to trying this sauce, because I love the ranchero sauce I have tried at other restaurants. This was more spicy and more tomato based than I had hoped. It was almost a little tobasco-y. More of a taco sauce than a ranchero sauce, and it wasn't really a very big hit in our household (although my husband will eat it).

review/summary: A Great COmpliment To Your Taco's!
review/text: This slightly tangy, and spicy, sauce is the perfect compliment for tacos! It adds just enough spicy heat to compliment your favorite taco combinations, without overpowering them.<br /><br />I have also used this sauce as a dip for carrot and celery sticks, as well as added it as a topping to tomato wedges as a side dish.<br /><br />Very young children may find it a bit overpowering in the heat department, but I don't think anyone else will feel it is too hot.<br /><br />****DISCLOSURE: This product was provided by the Amazon Vine program for independent review at no charge.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: Our family eats at Taco Bell on the rare occasion, and I've never been a big fan of their food.  Their sauces on the other hand, I've always liked.  And not only is it cheaper and better quality ingredients to make your own tacos for your family, but now you can have the awesome sauces, too.  I really like this one quite a bit.  It's got a little bit of a kick to it, and it's my husband's favorite.<br /><br />A little bit does go along way, and I cannot imagine anyone using the "serving size" of 2 tablespoons!  A teaspoon per taco is MORE than enough.  And I like it that way, that you get plenty of value out of the bottle.  Will definitely buy again, and will buy other flavors as well.

review/summary: has that taco bell taste
review/text: I have had this a couple times now with some homemade chicken fajitas. I like it. It really does carry that Taco Bell fast food type taste with it which is great if you are  a Taco Bell lover and maybe not so great if you don't like Taco Bell (but then again why would you get this product in the first place?). It is good enough that I will try some of the other Taco Bell sauces on the market.<br /><br />I did not find the sauce to be spicy.<br /><br />I will have to try this in a salad. I think it would make a great dressing.<br /><br />For the price I see on Amazon, I think it is  a great deal for a tasty sauce.

review/summary: Just a Bit of Kick
review/text: I can never get enough of Taco Bell sauce, so it's been great having an extra bottle around! This sauce has just a little bit of kick - not too spicy - and adds a great flavor to meat, chicken, etc. As far as nutrition goes, this sauce is not your friend, but then again, neither is Taco Bell! (but it's good to indulge once in a while) Just to give you an idea, there are about 11g of fat per 2 tablespoons.

review/summary: More like Tangy & Creamy
review/text: Taco Bell has introduced a new line of three "Bold & Creamy" sauces. Each of the "Bold & Creamy" sauces are based on soybean oil, water, vinegar, buttermilk,  and a few other standard ingredients. Taco Bell Bold & Creamy, Spicy Ranchero Sauce adds tomato to the primary recipe. Unlike the other two, this sauce has no peppers of any kind in its ingredients.<br /><br />The Spicy Ranchero Sauce has no perceptible heat, but the tang of the vinegar is much more noticeable than in the other varieties, especially if you use it as  dipping sauce. As I mentioned in one of my other reviews, I don't care for creamy sauces on my tacos. I did try the Spicy Ranchero Sauce on a couple of Taco Bell tacos, but still would choose one of the traditional red sauces.<br /><br />I made a sort of salad with celery, carrots, BBQ chicken strips, and tortilla strips. I used the Spicy Ranchero Sauce as a dressing and found it a good fit for this set of ingredients that was limited to what I had on hand at the moment. I've also used it as a dip for tortilla chips and vegetables. It occurred to me that it might be good on fish or shrimp tacos. I tried it on a Filet-O-Fish instead of tartar sauce. The fish flavor completely overwhelmed the Spicy Ranchero Sauce. I also tried it in place of seafood cocktail sauce with some cooked shrimp. It did not really add anything interesting to the shrimp.<br /><br />In my kitchen, the Spicy Ranchero Sauce is more likely to find use as a dressing or dipping sauce than a taco sauce.<br /><br />One note: the "Best if Used By" date on the bottle I received was a little over two months after I received it. This seems kind of short to me for a bottled product that's refrigerated after opening. It may have been an older lot, but it's something to keep in mind if you're thinking of ordering in bulk or taking advantage of a sale.

review/summary: Rich and Creamy
review/text: I tried two and liked the Ranchero better than the Chipotle. It has just a tang of sourness from the buttermilk and the flavor stays with you, has more body, and is definitely creamier. The Ranchero also tasted less artificial than the Chipotle. It makes a nice alternative to salsa on tacos and was great on a salad with chicken strips.<br /><br />It also made a pretty good dip for Doritos.<br /><br />I have to say though, when it comes to tacos, the hot sauce condiments at Taco Bell are all I need. The hottest tastes stronger than either of these bottled sauces and their liquid texture coats the taco layers better. In contrast, these are thick sauces that sit on top and after a couple of bites, you've still got half a taco with no sauce.

review/summary: Standard Taco Seasoning in a Subtle Ranch Package
review/text: I have tried a few of the new flavors of Taco Bell's new sauces, and this one is very, very average. The best I can describe it is the flavor of your standard taco seasoning - slightly zesty but never hot - coupled with a very mild ranch flavor. The texture is decently creamy (the consistency, say, of sour cream). It's lighter flavor pairs it best with white meat, but I think it is just zesty enough to stand up to beef also. Overall, this is a decent sauce if you are going for a pretty standard taco seasoning. But if you want spicy or a rich boldness, this sauce definitely is not for you.

review/summary: It's okay, but compared to the chipotle...it doesn't hold a candle
review/text: Taco Bell isn't exactly a source of gourmet flavors, whether it's "Mexican" or not.  I tried this flavor with high hopes after the complete shock of how wonderful the chipotle flavor was.  This one wasn't as spectacular.  I'm not sure what I expected with the "Ranchero" name, but whatever it was...it wasn't in this bottle.<br /><br />It has a touch of heat, but very little.  It's a more "vinegar-y" than the chipotle flavor was, and that was about it.  Most of us associate garlic with anything "ranch" and there was no discernible garlic flavor either.  It was a sauce that just was okay, nothing to get excited about, nothing to run to the store for your own bottle of either.  Utterly forgettable.<br /><br />Personally, I'll not bother with this flavor again.  It's just bleh.  The chipotle flavor is far better.

review/summary: Decent
review/text: I liked this more than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRKEH4">Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce</a>, but that isn't saying much. The sauce is basically ranch dressing mixed with some spices, but isn't all that spicy. Again like the Chipotle sauce, the Spicy Ranchero sauce has a two tablespoon serving that clocks in at 110 calories. For as fatty as these are, you'd think they'd taste better. I'd like to see Taco Bell cut some of the oils out and tweak the spiciness before trying this line again.

review/summary: Taco Bell Bold & Creamy, Spicy Ranchero Sauce
review/text: Although to me this wasn't bad, I didn't find this sauce to be very spicy or comparable to any other ranchero sauce I have tried in the past.  It was ok on enchiladas and nachos, but not my first choice for either.  I also found it to have an aftertaste that wasn't to my liking when used as a dip with chips or as a dressing on a taco salad.  Tastes are a personal thing, but for my tastes this just didn't appeal to me all that much beyond eventually finishing the bottle.  While I do really like the other Bold and Creamy sauces that Taco bell has out ((<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRMG98">Jalapeno Sauce</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRKEH4">Chipotle Sauce</a>), I don't think that is one that I am likely to pick up again.

review/summary: Tangy but not too spicy hot...a hit at our house!
review/text: Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce tastes like a mixture of sour cream and Taco Bell taco sauce.  It's tangy, tasty, and has a nice bit of zip to it, but at the same time it's not too hot.<br /><br />Sometimes companies have this idea that if a product falls into the "Mexican food" category that it has to be blisteringly spicy hot.  I don't like that kind of heat.  This sauce is not that way.  This sauce has a small bite and a touch of heat, but it's certainly not going to send you running for the sink for a big gulp of water to dowse the fire in your head/throat/belly.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good product.  We used it tonight as a topper for taco salad, though it would also work well as a dipping sauce for veggies or whatever else strikes your fancy.  I don't, however, think that this sauce would work well with marshmallows.  Heh heh.<br /><br />Like I mentioned before, it's a hit at our house.<br /><br />5 stars.

review/summary: Yucky aftertaste
review/text: I love regular Taco Bell hot sauce, so my dislike for this item has nothing to do with the brand. This creamy blend of ranch and spices is quite high in fat, but worse than that, simply doesn't taste very good. It is nice that the squeezable bottle does allow you somewhat to control how much sauce you pour onto your food, but the sad truth is that you won't want very much of this near your tacos. I would bet that you could take your own ranch dressing and create with the spices in your kitchen a better tasting sauce than this. Back to the tasting room for this flavor!

review/text: Its really pretty good! I found this is a pretty handy addition to many menu items, and a great alternative to basic taco sauce or salsa all the time. I like it best as a sauce for nachos and tacos, as it can stand up to heavier ingredients like beans and ground beef.<br /><br />I was a little concerned it would taste really artificial, but think it really is a good thing to have around the house actually. Its got a spicy yet well balanced flavor. I found it tastes especially good stirred in with a little sour cream to add lightness, and think it tasted really good with chicken.

review/summary: Fake tasting and not pleasant at all
review/text: I love Taco Bell, and have been known to hoard packets of hot sauce from the drive-thru so I can add them to all sorts of food (e.g., scrambled eggs, homemade quesadilla, etc.) When the opportunity to try this Ranchero sauce came up, I was so happy! Until I tried it... and, wow, this is really NOT a taste I enjoyed.<br /><br />Ranchero sauces are supposed to be a combination of tomato, green chile peppers, onions and other spices like cumin. This one has NO tomato flavor and, rather than a green chile taste it's more of a chile powder flavor... but a very STALE chile powder. Oh, it has zing, but even that doesn't taste right; it's not chile pepper or jalapeno-tasting. It just tastes fake and somehow muddled, like there are just too many things competing, and none of them are any good.<br /><br />Sorry, Taco Bell. I still love you, but I can't stand this sauce!

review/summary: Nice spicy replacement for other condiments
review/text: We just finished off a bottle of this stuff. I like spicy food, and this was a nice way of adding a little zest to some foods. I enjoyed it/ If you like spicy foods, it's worth a try.<br /><br />The label describes this as "Bold and Creamy Spicy Ranchero" and it's correct on all counts. The sauce in many respects is like a creamy salad dressing, and is fairly thick. The "spicy" is more of a delayed reaction--you'll notice it a second or two after eating. It's not too strong, either, and doesn't last that long. Medium spicyness or less, I'd say.<br /><br />Unfortunately, like most creamy-type sauces, this is extremely high in fat: 100 of the 110 calories per serving. If you're watching your fat intake you're not going to want to load up your meals on this stuff.<br /><br />This is intended to replace other spicy or sauce-like condiments, and it works surprisingly well. For instance, I've tried it on Mexican-type foods, salads, eggs, and breakfast potatoes. In most cases I was pleased with the results.

review/text: While this was a nice change from salsa and sour cream on my taco, it was not spicy enough. When it says spicy, I want spicy. If you normally use only salsa be aware that because this is a cream sauce, it has 10x the calories of salsa. But if you add sour cream, then it's comparable.  I esp liked that the bottle had a squeeze top so one could more easily control how much was used. I can't say that I"ll be buying this regularly but my kids liked it enough that I'll buy it if on sale or I have a coupon.

I tried it on a wrap with chicken, bacon, etc. While it was not a bad taste, it was nothing special. I probably would not purchase another bottle but will continue with mayonnaise. I did not try using it this way but it just might be good on something like a taco salad. I may try that with the remainder of the bottle. I guess I was expecting something a bit more out of the ordinary at the quoted price.

review/summary: Has some kick to it
review/text: This Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce has the perfect name. It's got a strong, bold flavor. It has a thick, creamy consistency. It has a nice spiciness to it, about the equivalent of Tapatio. I tried it on tostadas, chicken burritos, and as a salad dressing for a simple lettuce, carrot, tomato and cucumber mix. I felt I gave it enough opportunities. It's just not for me.<br /><br />It has a chemical flavor to me, like I find with Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing. The ingredients are: soybean oil, water, whey (from  milk), vinegar, dried buttermilk, salt, egg yolks, sugar, spice, dried tomato, modified food starch, dried garlic, garlic juice, dried onions, xanthan gum, citric acid, yeast extract, phosphoric acid, gum arabic, corn syrup, disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate, natural flavor, artificial color, sorbic acid and calcium disodium edta as preservatives.  I'm not sure what flavor I am picking up on, but it's enough to make me not want to eat it any more. It really is the same thing I taste with cream-based dressings that are bought at room temperature, so maybe it is the dried milk or some preservative.<br /><br />If you like Hidden Valley Ranch or similar dressings and would like a spicy ranchero sauce, this could definitely be the sauce for you.

review/summary: Good taste, but not spicy
review/text: We had tacos tonight and I tried out a couple new sauces from Taco Bell.  One of the sauces was the Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero sauce.  I liked the sauce on the tacos, but would have liked it better if it were hotter with a stronger spicy taste.  I like really hot and spicy food, so I found this pretty mild.  With that said, it had a good flavor and I liked it.<br /><br />I could see it being used on a variety of foods the same way you would use a ranch dressing.  The main ingredient is soybean oil and 100 of the 110 calories in a 2 Tbsp serving size are from fat, so this is not a diet or light dressing.<br /><br />Bottom line, I liked the taste, but would have liked it to have been hotter with more of a spicy kick.  It is fattening, so don't load up on it.  For a light different kind of ranch taste on top of your tacos or other dishes, it is a good sauce.

review/text: This sauce has a good spicy taste, could definitely taste the garlic.  I do not consider it "hot" in the least, just a flavor enhancement that some people will enjoy.  I used and liked in both fish tacos and traditional beef tacos.  Think it would also be good on top of bean nachos.  The sauce has a bit of a vinegar flavor but if used in a small quantity that flavor is dissipated by the food combined with it.<br /><br />Label statistics:<br />Two tablespoons have 110 calories, 100 of which are fat calories, 11 grams of total fat, 1.5 grams of saturated fat, zero trans fats.

review/summary: Not to bad, decent on Salad
review/text: If you make a salad, put some steak and tortilla chips on it and then add some of this stuff to the mix you come up with a really good tasting meal.  This stuff really is pretty decent and I would not hesitate to get it again.  It has a mild taste and is just good.  There are 110 calories per 2 tablespoons which might not seem like a lot but the little bit does go a long way.  It is creamy and I personally liked the stuff quite a bit.  I put it on some steak by itself and it adds an interesting taste to the steak as well.  Regardless, this is a really good tasting sauce that has multiple uses.

review/summary: Tastes Just Like the Baja Chalupa/Gordita Sauce
review/text: I'm pretty sure this is the same sauce they use at Taco Bell on the Baja Gordita and Chalupa.  It is pretty mild, so you can use it generously!  The texture is a little thicker than the other Taco Bell sauces, so this works best as a sandwich spread, since it won't run off as easily as the other varities.  I also like it as a hamburger topping, but this is a nice chicken dipping sauce too.  If you're making taco salad, this is the dressing of choice!

review/summary: Tasty Condiment
review/text: This is a nice extension of the Taco Bell brand.<br /><br />The day I got the bottle I immediately opened it and put some in a spoon to taste. It flowed smoothly and had a creamy texture. The flavor is what we have come to expect from "taco seasoning" in this country, with a nice spicy kick that wasn't overpowering.<br /><br />A couple of days later I took it out of the refrigerator to put on a chicken roll up. This time, without squeezing or shaking the bottle, it reminded me of the old Heinz ketchup commercial, where the kid put the ketchup bottle on its side on the fifth floor window sill, ran down the stairs, and put his hot dog out to receive the first dollop from the bottle. This thickened up that much in the cold. Still, it spreads smoothly and a little is all I needed.<br /><br />I also tried it as a salad dressing. While not my favorite, it could do in a pinch.<br /><br />Like most processed foods, it has too much salt and a lot more chemicals for my liking.<br /><br />While not something I would use every day, I would use this occasionally when I wanted a spicy kick to something.

review/summary: Taco Bell at home...kind of
review/text: If you enjoy Taco Bell's Spicy Ranchero sauce, you will more than likely appreciate having this on hand at home. I will warn, however; apply it sparingly until you get a feel for its impact on your meal. I personally got a little overzealous and almost ruined a meal with my first application. In other words, it is great but it is more potent than a Taco Bell lover might suspect. With this in mind, don't be afraid to try it on a variety of meals.

review/text: I picked this up for my sour cream and hot sauce loving husband. I thought it would be right up his alley. Well, he thinks it is way too mild. He likes the Fire sauce at Taco Bell and firmly believes that if you aren't sweating when you finish your burrito then you can't have enjoyed your meal. He did enjoy the texture but thought they needed to kick it up several notches if they are going to call it "Bold" and "Spicy".<br /><br />Not recommended for particularly Spicy Souls.

review/summary: More of a dip than a sauce. Pretty good.
review/text: Personally I would not use this as a sauce. It's to thick. Using Taco Bell's spiciness rating system of Mild, Hot, And Fire. This sauce would be between Hot and Fire. There is a strong cumin flavor that is offset with a creamy sauce base similar to Yogurt. So for me it would work better as a dip. It would also be good whipped into some sour cream for use in a taco dip.<br /><br />I frequently buy Taco Bell's original hot sauce.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1FZJQ">Taco Bell Restaurant Sauce, Hot, 7.5-Ounce Glass Bottles (Pack of 12)</a><br />It's really good and has a great heat level that most can enjoy.<br /><br />I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.<br />Would I spend my own money on this? No.

review/summary: Eh, not bad
review/text: Have now tried it on a number of different things including tacos and burritos, turkey burgers, cheeseburgers and as a veggie dip. In all cases, so-so. It is essentially a spicy mayo without any great character - about what you'd expect from Taco Bell, I suppose. In fact, I liked it best on the turkey burger where it took advantage of the turkey's natural blandness to stand out some. The creamy texture is nice, but all in all, I pretty undistinguished addition to the condiment world. Not terribly bold or spicy, but it got the creamy part right. A safe bet if you're looking for something to put out for company you don't know very well. Perfectly edible and forgettable.

review/summary: like Ranch with spices
review/text: I'm basing my review on taste alone and disregarding any nutritional information. If you like Ranch dressing with a little zing to it then you'll like this stuff. It's basically the same sauce that Taco Bell uses on their chalupas. Even though I have a high heat tolerance I couldn't imagine anyone thinking this is hot. I'm not even sure bold is an appropriate word. It just has a bit spiciness. That's not to say that I don't like it though. It's a delicious sauce that's good with wraps, sandwiches, salads and numerous other things. It'd also be great with numerous chicken preparations and Mexican dishes and I even used it with a baked fish dish. Overall it's a tasty sauce and I'd buy it again.

review/text: This sauce tastes like the exact same sauce Taco Bell uses on many of their restaurant items. It's rich and creamy, with a bit of a kick but isn't too spicy. It's well-seasoned with a blend of mexican spices that have a richer taste than just regular taco sauce when added to tacos, burritos and any other mexican dish you can think of. I've also used it on sandwiches and burgers instead of mayo to give them an interesting flavor. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because the bottle is a little on the small side, but everyone in my family really enjoyed this sauce, so I would likely buy it again.

review/summary: It is what it is...
review/text: I got this product mainly because I was curious about it.  I wanted to know what sauce Taco Bell would be bottling.<br /><br />The product is well packaged.  The consistency is about the same as stirred sour cream- about perfect in my book.  We shared the sauce among five different family members and each had a different take on it.  Most find it rather mediocre without any strong flavor elements.<br /><br />One person said, "it smelled like Taco Bell" although I didn't think so and when I asked if that was a good or bad thing got the reply, "it depends on whether you want Taco Bell or not."  They believe it is the same sauce used on some entries.<br /><br />The flavor was described in varying ways but most frequently as sour cream with chili powder added.  I thought I tasted cilantro (which I don't like), but it was not listed as in ingredient and no one else seemed to think I was right.  Everyone agreed that the sauce is not particularly spicy, definitely on the mild side.<br /><br />So, this won't be a staple at our house, but it wasn't bad- just not something we really loved to have around.

review/text: I like taco bell food for the most part and they usually do a good job of putting out decent products at the supermarket.  I like the ranchero sauce they serve in the store and was excited to try this product out.  The product has a good taste but not as powerful of one that I would have liked.  It could have had just a little more flavor and it would have been great.  It does add a little kick to your tacos though.  I also tried it on hamburgers and it added some flavor.  Overall a good product if you want a little change to the flavor of your food.

review/summary: Creamy and spicy sauce but no "spark"
review/text: This sauce is creamy and spicy but also one I think depends on a balance of the other ingredients involved.  You'll probably want to experiment with how much sauce, what cheese to pair with it, meat seasoning etc.<br /><br />I personally found it a medium in terms of spicy...neither too hot or mild.  It adds a certain "tang" to your taco.  However, it just wasn't the type of appealing taste that would make me crave it on a taco or other item.  Somehow it just seems to be missing something on it's own and needs other ingredients paired with it to make it more tasty.<br /><br />Honestly as much as I like most ranch sauces...sour cream and some taco sauce would have given the food more spark than this sauce.

review/summary: Not blown away by the flavor.  Pretty creamy.
review/text: I was excited to try this stuff, but to be honest, it has more of a creamy flavor/texture to it than a "spicy ranchero" sauce I was expecting.  Sour cream - that's it - it has that texture/flavor of sour cream.  I'm not a huge sour cream guy, but that's what it reminded me of.  It did not make my tacos taste like Taco Bells'.  Did I use the apostrophe correctly there?  Anyhow I love spicy food, and this barely made a blip.  It was almost distracting to use on my tacos.  I mean, the taco meat I make already has good spices in it, so covering it with this stuff kind of kills it.  Just know that this stuff is more "creamy" than "spicy".  Maybe it would be better on plain grilled beef?  I wasn't blown away by it, but I didn't hate it either.

review/summary: Pretty tasty
review/text: If I were to try to describe this product in as little detail as possible, I'd say that this is like typical Taco Bell fare: A good guilty pleasure but can't hold a candle to more genuine & higher quality Mexican sauces, but then you never really go to TB expecting anything to resemble its more genuine counterparts.<br /><br />The pluses of this product is that it goes well with a lot of stuff. It is, of course, good on Mexican food (tacoes, tortillas, etc), but it can also be used in other dishes. It makes a pretty good salad dressing when you use it in moderation. It also does well as a dipping sauce for chicken tenders (my mother was curious- she'll dip tenders in just about everything).<br /><br />What really disappointed me about this sauce was that for something that had both the words "spicy" & "bold" in its name, it didn't really seem to embody either word. Not even partially. It's tasty but if you're looking for something to really spice or heat up your meal then this isn't really going to do it. If all you're looking for is a decent sauce to complement a meal, this does the job.

review/summary: Taco Bell Salad Dressing
review/text: This flavor of this sauce is very reminiscent of the Taco Bell sauce packets, which I love.  These "creamy" versions take that familiar flavor and add a cream base, which is very similar to salad dressing.  I actually dressed some salad with it and it was pretty amazing!  Unfortunately, the bottle is too small to make that an economical choice, and this is intended instead as a "finishing sauce."  For example, adding it to tacos or burgers for a little extra kick.  If you like spicy food, this will not be enough, but it adds a little heat.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I would buy this over the translucent sauce, but it is very good.  If you like Taco Bell sauce and want something more substantive, I think you will enjoy these creamy sauces.  I've tried the Spicy Ranchero and the Chipotle, and the former has a more polished flavor, with the latter just a bit off.

review/summary: A Very Creamy, Mildly Spicy, But Not Very BOLD Ranchero Sauce
review/text: I have a meal at Taco Bell only once and a while, and I actually worked at one of their restaurants as a teenager back when the company was just beginning to sell franchises. Their hot sauce has changed a little through the years, so when I saw this Taco Bell (Bold & Creamy) Spicy Ranchero Sauce, I thought I would give it a try. I enjoy spicy food and so I noted that there are also two other Taco Bell sauces available on the market right now (one with jalape&ntilde;os!), but I thought I'd test this one first.<br /><br />Even before I opened the squeeze bottle, I was curious by the color of the sauce, which is visible through the bottle. Since it is a ranchero sauce, I guess I expected it to be a little more of a reddish color, as one of the primary ingredients in a ranchero sauce (at least in the southwest where I come from) is tomatoes or tomato paste. This product is a goldenrod or umber color. When I checked the ingredients, there are no tomatoes in this ranchero sauce. Who would dare put out a ranchero sauce without tomatoes? (wink)<br /><br />The bottle has a screw-on, flip-top cap, making dispensing the contents very easy. Once the seal was removed and I could open the cap, I took a whiff and there was definitely a creamy smell (if that is really possible), along with a mild scent of spices. According to the facts on the label, a single serving is 2 tablespoons. But I think that is overstating this product. When applying after-cooking sauces, it is important not to slather it on too thick, overwhelming the flavor of the food. My suggestion would be to cut that serving to about a quarter of a tablespoon, or even less, depending on what you are adding to. The product is very creamy with a nice consistency. Being on a low or no sodium diet myself, I was concerned with how much was in this product. If you cut down the individual serving as suggested, the amount of sodium is reasonable.<br /><br />Now, let's get to the question and the fear all of the non-international food eaters. "How spicy is it?" Surprisingly, the smell is more Bold than the spicy taste, and there is very little lingering spicy aftertaste, too. In other words, even Midwesterners will enjoy this Taco Bell product. My daughter, who thinks salt and pepper qualifies as "spicy," almost put some on her chicken. I've tried this on rotisserie chicken (a very small amount), roasted potatoes, hamburgers, grilled pork chops, a lettuce, spinach leaf and grilled chicken salad, meatloaf, and even on green beans and fried rice. All of these taste-tests came through with flying colors, although I'm not sure why they included the term Bold on the label. It's much milder than that. As I mentioned before, as long as you don't overwhelm the food, it does add a nice, creamy and mildly spicy flavor to the food. Interestingly, the flavor of the ranchero sauce was a little different with each food I tried it on. I was impressed with that.<br /><br />So, how much money is this going to put you back? The Taco Bell (Bold & Creamy) Ranchero Sauce comes packaged in six, 8-ounce squeeze bottles for around $2.00 and some change. Not a bad value if you go lightly on the sauce. As with most products like this one, you must shake vigorously before serving and refrigerate after opening. I'm going to be interested in whether this ranchero sauce retains its flavor over the long haul. Maybe that's why Taco Bell decided to package it in only an 8-ounce bottle?<br /><br />Overall, it is a good product. Not the best ranchero sauce I've tasted (no tomatoes?!), but still a very pleasant flavor. In fact, I was impressed with it enough that I want to try the jalape&ntilde;os sauce next.

review/text: A little of this creamy sauce goes a very long way!  I found it to be quite spicy.  Yummy, but spicy!  The consistency is fairly thick... thicker than your average ranch salad dressing, for example.  We used this as if it were taco sauce on top of our tacos, and it was too much for me.  I would use it instead by stirring a bit into the taco meat so that the sauce coats the meat lightly before building the taco.  Don't think it would be all that great as a dip.  But could be a good way to spice up a sandwich by adding it to mayo.

The suggested portion of 2 Tbsp is a bit much unless you have a lot of lettuce and tomatoes (think salad dressing here). It doesn't taste bad at all, but if you're expecting hot and bold you may be disappointed. Like another reviewer said, the more veggies, the better this sauce is...but you may want to add some salsa or hot sauce to it if you want it hotter.

review/summary: Really Southwest Yummy!
review/text: I love mexican and southwest foods so I was excited about trying this product out by Taco Bell. As soon as you open the bottle it smells like the herb cumin, like a bowl of chili. Now for the flavor...first it's sweet on the tongue, then tangy followed by a spicy finish. It's very good and I had it on a burger since I didn't make taco's last night and it was awesome, better than ketchup or spicy mustard like I normally have on it. I know that it will be excellent on taco's when I do make them! Highly recommend :)

review/summary: There's some Ranch dressing on my taco...
review/text: Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce isn't bad, but it's not anything that's going to change how you approach tacos either. It's basically a thick Ranch Dressing with some Mexican spices (chili powder seeming to be the most obvious) thrown in to spice things up a bit. Don't get this thinking that it's going to be spicy as in "hot," because it definitely isn't. It's basically just a creamy Ranch dressing given the Taco Bell treatment. I wasn't impressed with the smell at all, but after trying it on a burrito and a couple of tacos, it's pretty good. The suggested serving size (2 tablespoons) seems a bit much if you're only eating a few tacos, and you could probably get away with a bit less on a taco salad (it's thicker than a regular salad dressing). All-in-all, it's not a bad product and it tastes reasonably good, but it's just not good enough to be a must-buy.

review/summary: pretty good, versatile, much better than the chipotle flavor
review/text: Having been disgusted by the Chipotle flavor Taco Bell sauce, my expectations were low for this Spicy Ranchero Sauce.<br /><br />I was surprised!  This is great...first off, the color doesn't blind you like the other radioactive orange sauce.  Secondly, this could be used in different ways.  We made homemade quesadillas with just a bit of this mixed in the cheese.  Also, we tossed some on some cooked chicken and that was good.<br /><br />Finally, we thinned it down a bit with water (just a little) and it made a great salad dressing with pine nuts, avocado, and tortilla strips.<br /><br />The flavor is mild with no heavy aftertaste (like the chipotle).<br /><br />I think thinning it a bit is a good idea because the bottle (8 ounces) is small and it's pretty thick...it likely wouldn't last an entire dinner if you have three little piggies at the table!

review/text: I tried this on a taco salad and it was great.  Be advised that a little goes a long way.  I found it was perhaps more bold than spicy, but tasted very nice and left a great after taste.  I eat often at Taco Bell anddon't recall them having this in the resturant... they should because I think it would become a favorite quickly.  I recommend this sauce.

review/text: I enjoyed this sauce.  It was tangy and spicy, and I thought it was great!  I have used it several times on several different things.<br /><br />When I first got it, I used it as a dipping sauce, and it really spiced things up.  I have used it as a dressing on a taco salad, and that was delicious as well.  I also made some chicken wraps, and I used the sauce in those.  It gave it just the right kick.  I have heard it is wonderful on tacos, so that is what I will use it on next.<br /><br />I'm sure there are several other great things to use this sauce with, and I can't wait to try them out!

review/summary: Not too spicy; not too bland; just right.
review/text: I wasn't sure what this sauce would taste like; I was afraid that it would have the flavor (chili powder, etc.) you sometimes get on southwestern food, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I don't know what to compare it with because it's so different.  It has a great flavor and some residual heat, but not too much.  I really like it, and I look forward to trying it on other foods besides celery and veggie burgers.  (I like to experiment.)  One family member tried it on a chicken sandwich and a hamburger; she said that it's better on the burger.  (I suspect it's too strong for chicken.)  Another family member, who's really fussy about sauces, said that we should get it again.  And I'd love to try it on a taco salad.  Yup, I'm going to put it on the shopping list.

review/text: Let's face it.  There are times you want that Taco Bell taste and flavor, but you don't want to run out get it.  This is a good way to add that flavor to whatever you are eating.  Better yet, when you want this on something Taco Bell doesn't have, you have it to use.  I also hate to say it, but there are other Mexican restaurants with better food, but they lack the sauce you enjoy.  Now you can bring some of this along and add it to your favorite.

review/summary: Taco Bell Bold & Spicy Ranchero Sauce
review/text: I made tacos today and tried this sauce on tacos and also on just a taco type salad. It has a nice mild flavor with a bit of bite. I'm not a real fan of super spicy sauces so this was good for me. My son liked it and also my husband who normailly will not eat anything with garlic or spicy peppers. He found it to be creamy and mild. I noticed the slight bite, but it wasn't a lot or anything that was apparent for very long after swallowing it. All in all I would recommend this to anyone who isn't into the extremely hot sauces, but would like to add a little touch of sauce to tacos and also on a taco salad.

review/summary: Good for what it is, and a good value
review/text: In the interest of full disclosure, I have pretty much abandoned fast food, and Taco Bell was never my favorite "Mexican" place in any case.  However, my teenaged son loves him Taco Bell morning, noon, and evening, or at least he would if given half a chance, so I thought I would run it past his taste buds to see how he liked it.<br /><br />We tried this at home with chicken soft tacos, with lettuce & tomatoes out of the garden, and the chicken seasoned with one of my own spice blends.  I'm trying my best to give this sauce the best venue in which to shine.<br /><br />My impressions:  Not bad!  I really didn't expect to like it one bit.  However, it has a nice flavor, and a little bit goes a long way.  The more lettuce and tomatoes you have in your mix, the better this sauce likes it.  The serving suggestion of 2 tbsp is much, much more than you will actually need.  I was actually quite surprised that the sodium content (albeit not low by any means) were not higher.  If you have sodium concerns and you behaved yourself during the day, a dollop of this is not going send your intake levels skyrocketing.  Same thing with the calories; not great, but it could be much much worse.  I don't know if I would call this "Bold."  This makes me think it is going to be fairly hot, but it isn't.  Just moderately spicy.<br /><br />The boy's impressions:  It's OK.  Not nearly hot enough (but he will pour 1/4 cup of Tabasco on food if it is available) but it tastes OK.  He has zero interest in nutritional value, nor in serving sizes, considering that he engulfed his chicken taco in roughly 1/3 of the sauce in the bottle.<br /><br />Which leads to another positive:  this is a pretty decent value, especially if you have a teenaged diner who recklessly slathers his food with far more sauce than is necessary.  I'm not sure this would be a regular part of my kitchen pantry, but Taco Bell has left me pleasantly surprised.

review/text: This Taco Bell sauce misses the mark. I gave a very positive review for the other two flavors of Taco Bell sauce, but this one is no good. It is almost like they are trying to get a cheesy nacho taste in this, but it comes off like fake cheese flavor. Really very unappealing, and I suggest you not waste your time/money on this one. The Chipotle and the Jalapeno sauces are wonderful, but this one is a loser.

review/text: I love sauces like this. The first day I received it, I had chicken breasts thawing for dinner that night.  I tenderized the chicken, and poured some of this on and let it sit for a few hours, till I was ready to cook dinner.  I then sauteed the chicken and when it was almost done, I poured more of this one, added a little shredded cheese and man, oh man, it was YUMMY !!!!!!<br />Everyone was like "this is great, what is that taste?"<br />The next day for lunch, I packed myself some veggies in a container that had another smaller container for dipping sauces and I put this in it.  It was so good to eat at work.  It was different and not the boring old lunch.<br />That night, I made some baked potatoes and all of us put this on our potatoes.  We all used this also, except my hubby, he also put cheese and diced onions on his.<br />This sauce has a bold, but not overkill taste.  It will liven up any old thing you cook, trust me.  Use it on beef, chicken, fish, veggies, etc.  I even made a ham and cheese sandwich a few days later and spread some on the bread.<br />you can go wrong with a univeral sauce like this.  None of us are rich so when I can find something that has many uses, I consider it a bargain.  My whole family loves it, it comes from a brand I trust and it's very versatile.  Please give this a try if you struggle to come up with some new ideas for dinners, lunch, snacks.  Amazon has it for a great price.  It's not too spicy for kids.  It does have a kick but it's subtle, as least it is for me and my family.<br />Perfect item because you can use it hundreds of different ways for different foods for different people.  I am looking forward to adding some to my mashed potatoes !

review/text: I really hate giving a negative review to anything. That being said, I was not impressed with this product. It's called Bold and Creamy Spicy Ranchero sauce, but it was not bold and it was not spicy. It had a bland taste to it. It was not a bad taste, just bland. It was creamy though. I was hoping it was Taco Bell's Volcano sauce being marketed under a different name for supermarkets, but it wasn't. There was a slight chipolte taste to it, but I think there are better products out there. I tried this sauce on Taco Bell's new triple steak flatbread and ended up having to put some steak sauce on as well. I would not recommend this and it looks like others feel the same way as I have being seeing this on the shelfs of close-out store Big Lot's.

review/summary: Creamy sauce with a hint of spicy-ness
review/text: I like my food hot - the hotter the better.  I like to add a variety of sauces to various dishes to change them/spice them up.  One meal I make a lot is bland in and of itself so it is the sauce that lends interest to it.  I primarily got this sauce to use when eating that dish.  Its name suggests it is "bold and creamy" and I'll let them have that.  It is a reddish colored, creamy sauce that does have a very good flavor and just a hint of heat.  It makes my food enjoyable to eat.  For 5 stars I'd want it butt-burner hot, though I do recognize that they are trying to cater to the food tastes of the majority and a sauce like that would be purchased by a minority.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I'm not a big fan of spicy, but I do love regular ranchero sauce, so I gave this a whirl. The 2-tablespoon serving size is a little much - I ended up using about 2.5 teaspoons on a small fajita to get it to a taste that was noticeable but not overwhelming. It does have a bold kick to it, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it a spicy kick - more like an intense flavor to be used in small doses alongside multiple ingredients.<br /><br />The sauce does not expire per se, but does have a "best by" date. In my case, its "best by" date was the day before it arrived in the mail. I'm willing to assume this was a fluke, however.

review/summary: Good flavor, but on the salty side
review/text: If you're a fan of the Taco Bell quesadilla and you are looking to capture an authentic Taco Bell flavor in your kitchen this is the sauce for you.  Overall I liked the flavor, but it is almost overwhelmingly salty in isolation.  It makes a great sauce (and has a perfect consistency) for tacos (even fish tacos) and salads.  In other applications such as in quesadillas or burritos (things without a lot of flavorless filler like lettuce to absorb the potency) the ranchero sauce can be somewhat overpowering.  I did have great luck using the sauce add a little punch to fajitas and pan fried vegetables.  In reality, this isn't an all purpose sauce and it's somewhat nuanced as to the types of dishes it works in.<br /><br />I wasn't happy with the nutrition facts, but I found that you don't need near the 2 tablespoons reflected in the serving size (you can get away with 1/4 of that and still get the same flavor).<br /><br />Calories 110<br />Total Fat 11 g<br />Saturated 2 g<br />Polyunsaturated 0 g<br />Monounsaturated 0 g<br />Trans 0 g<br />Cholesterol 10 mg<br />Sodium 310 mg<br />Total Carbs 3 g<br />Dietary Fiber 0 g<br />Sugars 1 g<br />Protein 0 g<br />Potassium 0 mg<br />Vitamin A 2%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />I went back and forth as to whether to give this product a 3 or 4 star rating, but honestly, I'll buy it in the future and it's one of the better (and less expensive) pre-made sauces on the market today.  The saltiness and the nutrition value are the big turn-offs for me.

It has just enough zip to give a little kick to your omelette, sandwich, or salad, but it's not so spicy that you'll have to warn family members who are averse to overly spicy foods.<br /><br />I actually do make tacos at home sometimes, using those convenient taco kits available in the supermarket (there's even a kit made by Taco Bell), so I'm sure I'll try this sauce in conjunction with actual tacos at some point.  But for now, this zippy, tasty, and nicely creamy sauce is regularly performing satisfying condiment duties in our kitchen.<br /><br />So, yeah, stop making your mustard, mayo, ketchup, and boilerplate salad dressings do all the work.  Your favorite foods, as well as your taste buds, will appreciate the flavorful zing of Taco Bell Bold & Creamy, Spicy Ranchero Sauce.

review/text: If you know Mexican food--real, good Mexican food--it is hard to think of putting a creamy sauce on a taco. I can't. It just doesn't seem right. However, this sauce does have a relatively good "mexican" flavor and it is good for other things, like a salad or a sandwich. The "creamy" part of it is definitely there. Seems like milk, or some component of it, is a prominent feature. Not for me, but some may find uses for it.

review/text: I expected this to be a creamy taco topper, a bit spicy, a bit tangy, and a bit like Ranch. I wasn't sure I'd like it, so I didn't put it directly on my taco. I put a puddle of this sauce on the side of my plate, and thank god that's all I did! This was, in a word, disgusting. It was so bad, in fact, that after my first taste of it, I went back in the kitchen and WIPED IT OFF MY PLATE. I didn't want to look at it. I didn't want to smell it. I didn't want it anywhere near me. My dinner companions hated it just as much.<br /><br />You know what came to mind? Harry Potter. You know those jelly beans Harry Potter eats in the first or second book? The flavor of this sauce makes me think of the earwax jelly bean. Or the vomit one. It's just that bad!<br /><br />I absolutely love taco bell's restaurant sauce. It's a shame I didn't like this as well.

Now to classify it as Mexican food here in SoCal is going too far, so I don't categorize it, I just like it.<br /><br />I like their sauce and their flavorings, so was eager to try this out.<br /><br />And I like it.<br /><br />It's only slightly hot, which is nice for those of us who like to taste our food rather than experience burning from it.<br /><br />Adds a nice flair to any meal.  Last night I put some on a turkey burger, and it was great!<br /><br />From what I can tell, this is basically a mix of ranch dressing and mild or medium hot sauce, but here are the exact ingredients, if you're interested:<br /><br />soybean oil, water, whey (from milk), vinegar, buttermilk, salt, egg yolks, sugar, spice, tomato, food starch, garlic, garlic juice, onions, xanthan gum, citric acid, yeast extract, phosphoric acid, gum arabic, corn syrup, disodium insinate and disodium guanylate, natural flavor and colors, preservatives.

review/summary: strange product
review/text: It really doesn't "fit in" anywhere. I can't imagine this processed stuff is going to be better for you than natural spices or peppers. Its kind of zippy but I felt there was a strange after taste. I can't describe as anything more than "artificial".<br /><br />It tastes ok and puts a little zip into an otherwise bland meal.<br /><br />I wouldn't go overboard with it.<br /><br />I prefer tabasco & natural peppers & spices to this.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.

review/summary: Spicy
review/text: There is no question that when it does come down to Taco Bell, they have definitely made some of the most daring in spicy fast foods. But when they came out with their own line of sauces, I was definitely a skeptic. Their creamy spicy ranchero sauce definitely brings in a nice kick. I honestly though was a bit surprised that it had so much garlic in the sauce, but yet there could've been a little bit of jalepeno and a little bit more mexican spices in it. Still, if you're a fan of Taco Bell, and looking for a new way to spice up the food you eat, than I suggest you give their spicy ranchero sauce a try.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: B 1/2-<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-

review/summary: My Honest Vine Review
review/text: Of a family of five, nobody really likes it.  To me, the taste is bland.  My sons claim it is just colored mayonnaise.  I really cannot recommend anybody buy it because it has sat in my refrigerator uneaten for awhile now and I suspect it is going to go bad before we ever eat it.  Maybe it is an acquired taste or some others might like it, but it is definitely a no-go for our family.

review/text: This sauce was a yummy addition to our usual Mexican dinner of tacos and nachos. It was spicy and delicious. I don't recommend using it in fajitas. Something about the flavor combination wasn't right. The other Taco Bell flavors are better for fajitas. I like that it's an easy way to spice up an ordinary south of the border meal! And, as a busy mother of five, I need all the help I can get.

review/text: I have been trying to make my own spicy ranchero sauce by adding taco seasoning to ranch dressing and it never has come out quite the way I hoped (too gritty most of the time)...

review/summary: Ranch Dressing, with A Little Spice
review/text: Having reviewed the other two Taco Bell sauces, I felt I had to complete the trifecta, and so ended up with this one.  It was everything I expected: kind-of orange ranch dressing with a little bit of cayenne, chile powder and a hint of cumin to turn it from bland, boring "ranch" into wild, frenetic, dangerous "ranchero."<br /><br />I have the same complaints as with the other two sauces: not spicy enough, and just a little bit too runny.  While the chipotle sauce demands its presence be recognized with its hazmat-orange coloring, this stuff has the implicitly unhealthy muted pink of a "flesh" crayon, the sickly pink of weak thousand-island dressing or underdone meat.  I can understand Taco Bell's need to visually differentiate the product, but this pink is a bit on the wrong side of icky.<br /><br />My kids (16, 13) did like this sauce, and my 13-year-old son asked if we could buy some more.  Score one for Taco Bell.<br /><br />The taste was not bad, not at all.  I had a hard time differentiating it from the chipotle sauce, with this one having that slightly funky buttermilk aftertaste and the chipotle coming across as just a bit more smoky (and a lot more visually orange).  It tasted just fine albeit weak, on pork chops, grilled sausage, and over both green beans and cauliflower.  The kids poured it on everything, including white rice.  It was gone pretty quickly, owing to the small bottle, and my kids' enthusiasm.<br /><br />Bottom line: You'll love this sauce, America, as it's a tiny little baby step past ranch dressing, but a long way from truly spicy.  The completely unremarkable texture allows the slightly altered flavor--with a Hispanified name, to boot--to bring you to a whole new level of mealtime condimentation.

review/summary: This is my favorite of the new Taco Bell sauces that came out.
review/text: I have actually tried all three new Taco Bell Sauces, the Spicy Ranchero which I am reviewing now, and also the Jalape&ntilde;o and the Chipotle sauces.<br /><br />Of the three, the Spicy Ranchero is my favorite because it has the flavor that seems to be most agreeable with the widest array of food products, it has a flavor that would seem to compliment most anything.  You could easily use this on a taco salad (or just a plain lettuce salad  You can use it on a burrito, or to dip veggies, or with French fries, or tater tots... pretty much anything that requires a dipping sauce where you want a light kick of spice.  It tastes a lot like ranch with taco sauce mixed in.  Probably a bad description because it does really taste good.  As I said, this is my favorite sauce of the three.<br /><br />The bottles are squeeze bottles but I found that they don't squeeze out easily once you are half way done with the bottle.  You have to store upside down in the fridge or be forced to really shake the bottle to get the sauce to be forced down the the top.  Sauces are thicker than traditional salad dressings.

review/summary: I won't be buying it
review/text: I received a complimentary bottle through Amazon's vine program to review. We have big boys2men in the family, whose team-mates are around a lot of the time. We make a lot of tacos in our family. We make our own taco sauce so our tastes may be biased to anything in a bottle, but I was willing to try it as the guys like the "crema" on their tacos sometimes too (that's a Mexican product).<br /><br />We all like spicy and this says BOLD but believe us, it is not.  We couldn't seem to get a real flavor out of it. Even tried it as a dip on a chip but then they really didn't like it. Perhaps on a burger as one reviewer described would be best, in place of say the "secret sauce" some people like on their burgers. I tried it on my salad, but didn't care for it that way either :(<br /><br />Sorry, we couldn't give it a better review but it won't make our grocery list.

review/summary: Not bold or spicy, mainly just fatty
review/text: I received my bottle of Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero sauce free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review.<br /><br />I love Taco Bell, and was eager to try this new product. It comes in a plastic bottle with a squeeze top, which is nice for controlling how much you pour on your food.<br /><br />I made burritos for dinner so we could try it out, but we were all disappointed.  The flavor was very fake and left an aftertaste that none of us liked. Reading the nutrition label, I wondered what Taco Bell was thinking.  Two tablespoons contains 310 mg salt, 11 gms fat, and 110 calories!  It's pretty low carb - 3 gms - if you're counting carbs.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed is soybean oil, followed by water, whey, vinegar and sugar.  Tomato paste and spices are way down the list, and the last 5-6 ingredients are unpronounceable.  I would expect a ranchero sauce to have tomatoes and spices as the first ingredients.<br /><br />Sorry, but this sauce won't be a regular at our table.

review/text: I was excited to try this spicy ranchero sauce and thought it would work really well with nachos and cheese fries.  I don't know how to explain it, but when I tasted this sauce, it's starts off with a creamy ranch flavor but then turns into a bitter burnt taste, after that the spicyness hits and the flavor left over is a burned spicy after taste.  If you're eating it on spicy foods, you don't really notice it at all, but with fries or neutral foods, it always has that bitter aftertaste.  It was definitely not what I was hoping for.

review/text: I have tried all three flavors and Spicy Ranchero is by far my favorite.  It's best on beef but I like it on chicken as well.  It's worked out really well for getting Taco Bell drive through tacos, which is mainly what I've used it for.  I've also used it mixed with a little fat free sour cream for a taco salad topping.  The taste reminds me a lot of the sauce on Taco Bell chalupas.  The serving size is huge, you can use a lot less than 1 ounce -- more like 4-5 drops per taco.  If you want to try a Taco Bell sauce, I recommend trying this one first, it's the most delicious and very versatile.

review/summary: Creamy, delicious, not too spicy!
review/text: This tastes like a sauce or dressing from a restaurant! One of our favorite Mexican restaurants serves a giant grilled taco salad with a dressing that tastes identical to this. I wish the bottle were larger, due to the popularity of this sauce in our household.<br /><br />It's creamy, tastes mayo-based with a little Ranch/cumin zip, yet is not heavy. (The cumin taste comes through very aggressively so a cumin-hater probably will not like this!) It has a little kick but it's not too hot for folks who dislike spicy food.<br /><br />So far we've used this as a salad dressing, on wrap sandwiches, and it made a delicious chicken pasta salad! It even made a great dipper for french fries and sweet potato fries. We'll be using this for taco night and on tostadas, and as a dip for grilled meats and veggies. I think a burger with avocado slices would just love this sauce! So far this is one of my favorite Taco Bell sauces!<br /><br />Serving Size is 2 Tablespoons; it has 110 calories, 11 grams of fat, and 3 carbs. 1 gram of that is sugar. This<br />is made with sugar and corn syrup, for those who like to avoid either or both.

review/summary: A good sauce for non-mexican food as well!
review/text: Timing is everything in this world! When the bottle of Taco Bell Bold & Creamy, Spicy Ranchero Sauce (gee, do you think they could have added a few more descriptive words to the label?) arrived we were having burger night at the house, including fries and a small salad. So, needless to say, we got to use the sauce immediately on a non-Mexican food menu. Our thoughts: the sauce added a bit of zest as a salad dressing. As a dipping sauce for the fries it wasn't a real good combo. It might be due to the addition of salt to the mix. But when added to a hamburger in place of ketchup I found it a great change of pace. Throw a few onions on it as well and I really enjoyed the burger (in fact I had two which I really not suppose to do on my diet).<br /><br />As for the accuracy of the label description, it is not what I would call BOLD, definitely not overpowering a taste. It is a very creamy sauce with a good consistency to it. But it is not very spicy in my opinion which I feel is ok. A lot of the time I find that increasing the heat of a sauce is at the expense of the taste. I think this could have been a wee bit hotter but since I find the flavor enjoyable it's not a problem.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the taste. It is something that I will purchase for many different types of food. In fact I'm kind of wondering how it would be mixed into a meatloaf. Hmm, that may be my next menu for it.

There are 110 calories per 2 tablespoon serving.<br /> The sauce was very ranch-y.  It seems to me that they took a ranch dressing and mixed it with their own blend of Taco Bell spices.  It was bold tasting, but overwhelmingly ranch.  Also, it was not very spicy, just seasoned.  It wasn't a bad flavor at all, but not what I was expecting.  The other suggested uses are for wraps and sandwiches.  I think it would work well on certain types of sandwiches, but for tacos, it was not quite what I was looking for.

This sauce has a nice bold ranch flavor that is spicy, but not so much as to burn your mouth. It adds a good kick to anything that you put it on. I wish the bottle was a little bigger because it seems to go very fast (maybe because I liked it). It is like a ranch-flavored chipotle sauce, so use it anywhere you want that flavor. I think this was a very good thing for Taco Bell to come up with. Use this to give any meal a little southwest style.
