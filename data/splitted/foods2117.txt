review/summary: Nature's own soda pop and great for athletes' too
review/text: Crisp when chilled and refreshing without synthetic flavorings or added sucrose, Zico is the packaged beverage my yard men prefer. The smart-paper carton packaging created less bulk waste than canned drinks, and nature's own engineering packs this fruit punch with five electrolytes, the most overtly critical of which is potassium. I didn't think I would like this product but bought it because I cannot quite manage the full-time taste for spring water and herbal tea my yoga regime suggests. VERY helpful for those weaning themselves off alcohol and conventional mystery soda-pop.

review/text: I bought this new Zico water hoping to have the good taste it had before but unfortunately it tastes horrible. I could not bear drinking half bottle. Very funky taste. I am from Brazil and I sure know what young coconut water tastes like...and what they did to the taste of it is nowhere close to real coconut water. Perhaps works for those who like aged coconut water.<br />I wish I could return my order. Never buying it again. Back to O.N.E.

review/text: I used to LOVE the ZICO Coconut Water.<br />I used to buy 2 boxes monthly.<br />Until they decided to change from the Tetra-Pack to the Platic Bottles.<br /><br />For some reason, ZICO thinks its a better product, unfortunatly, the plastic leaches to the Coconut Water and changes the taste. It literally taste like plastic.<br /><br />I stopped buying ZICO and went over to O.N.E., not as tasty as the Tetra-Pack ZICO, but atleast doesnt taste like plastic!!!<br /><br />KEEP AWAY FROM ZICO, until they change it back to Tetra-Pack!<br /><br />Aparently i found out after some dabling online. Its not 100% coconut water, they changed the process where they make the coconut water out of CONCENTRATE.....honestly...concentrate??? No i am pissed off.....

review/summary: Bad News! FYI! The only coconut water that is MADE FROM CONCENTRATE
review/text: I've tried C2O, Vitacoco, and Naked coconut water. All of them contain one ingredient:100% natural coconut water. However, ZICO is the ONLY coconut water that is 1) Made from concentrate and 2) contains added "Natural ingredients". At trader joes, Zico costs about 2 bucks, which is the same price for C20 coconut water and Vitacoco which both do NOT have "natural flavors" added to it and are NOT from concentrate. The packaging advertises "30 percent less sugar"...well that's because they took out 30% of the coconut water and replaced it with water. It was so nasty that they had to add "natural flavors". Do not buy this brand. When I was a little kid I used to suck on my water squirt guns and the taste of this coconut water resembles that-like plastic/water with a small hint of coconut water. The other brands are so much better and are actually natural. For the same price, go get a coconut water that is not from concentrate. My favorite is C20.

review/summary: Fake.
review/text: This is the product that rocked my world... In a bad way. After buying this I realized that some companies (and people) will do anything for a profit - like rip off their fellow man.  Here's how....<br /><br />Zico used to be real 100% coconut water. Now, after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them, it's dumbed down: it's now part coconut water (juice) watered down with H2O (water) with unspecified "natural flavor" added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water hasn't just been seriously diluted. Why?  It's cheaper!  They save money by cutting it with plain water.  But it wouldn't taste the same, right?  That's where the flavoring comes in.... To trick you.<br /><br />Zico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads.... They brag this product has 30% less sugar than other brands.  Ok, that means this is likely a 70% coconut to 30% water mixture.  Do you want 100% coconut water or 70% coconut water in your bottle?<br /><br />This isn't the ratio nature intended by the way.  And if that means 30% less sugar (ie 30% less actual coconut water in the bottle) it also means 30% less electrolytes than you should be getting from a 100% product too.  It's just logic.

review/summary: Potassium Explosion!  Cholesteral Marvel!
review/text: I used to not like Coconut water.  When I was in Thailand in 2005 I had a fresh one sliced open and could barely put it down.  Years later, by forcing myself to love it, I now am addicted.  You can learn to love this stuff.  And with its many muscle revitalizing and cholesterol healing properties, you can too.  Coconut water reportedly has a unique long-form cholesterol that helps regulate bad cholesterol, among other healing properties.  Not a low calorie food, are you kidding?  This is nothing compared to juice, tea, soda, etc..  The only natural drinks that have it beat on calories are black coffee and tea. This product is not from concentrate and tastes delicious.  If I could afford it, I would only need this one drink for life and I'd be happy.

Great as a post-workout substitute for chocolate milk or a banana.  My little case ran out quickly as my husband discovered it and loves it, too.  However, I went to re-order the same exact item and was shocked to see that the price of a 12 pack jumped from $21.51 to $53.95!<br /><br />Come on, Amazon, really?  This is obviously a hot item at the moment, but you're letting your sellers get away with blatant thievery!  What a disappointment.

review/text: My boyfriend and I both love coconut water and have been trying different brands for a while. We decided to stick with Zico but it doesn't contain extra sugar or other fruit juices like some of the other ones that we've tried. What I also like is the fact that I can subscribe for the product through amazon to get the case sent to me every month! This definitely takes the hassle out of going to the store to get it and I think it's set at a great price point. We've been going through our case so fast (we're pretty active) that I've increased my case count to 2 every month!

review/text: I tried Zico in the plastic bottle, never in the tetra pack.<br /><br />Zico in the plastic bottle tastes like watery skim milk with a really really slight hint of coconut flavor. If you ever tried Taste Nirvana coconut water before, Zico pales in comparison. Zico is less sweet and saltier version of Taste Nirvana coconut water. I've also tried VitaCoco. Compared to VitaCoco, Zico tastes creamier than VitaCoco and doesn't have that sour taste.<br /><br />However, in all honesty, Zico tastes like skim milk and nothing like real coconut water from a fresh coconut.

review/text: I've always enjoyed the original Zico coconut water, but thought I'd give some of the other flavors a try. The mango flavor really jumped out at me because I love mangoes and thought coconut and mangoes would perfectly compliment each other. Unfortunately, the Zico drinks with "natural mango flavor" taste like someone dropped a mango flavored hard candy into my Zico drink. It's not terrible, but that's definitely NOT the refreshing flavor I was hoping for, especially after a hard workout! I think I can manage to power through the remaining 11 drink boxes I bought, but I won't be wasting my money on this drink again.

OB said to drink more liquids but I still have morning sickness and liquids before 10 AM dont stay down.  I tried several different coconut waters and found this Zico chocolate, ONE with guava and Naked plain to be the three I prefer.  This Zico chocolate is my favorite!  It is good in the morning when milk is too heavy and fruit juice is unappealing.  I feel much better after a couple of weeks drinking 1-2 coconut waters a day in addition to as much regular water I can stomach.  It is an expensive habit, but prescription anti nausea pills or going to the ER from dehydration is more expensive.

review/text: I received my case of Zico Coconut Water within the two days advertised by "Amazon Prime".  It was interesting to me that, what with the free shipping, this was more than a dollar a bottle cheaper than I buy it for in the grocery store.  It came double boxed.  That is, there was a compartmentalized container with the liter bottles carefully packed within, this box was surrounded by air bag packaging and packed within a larger sturdy cardboard container.  Great packaging.<br />  My wife uses this product and her comments follow:  As to the taste.  I found I prefer Zico over the other brands as it doesn't appear to have any "hidden" sugar added to hype up the taste.  My previous brand, Vita Coco,  did not declare added sugar, but it did leave that sugared drink after taste in my mouth and was noticeably sweeter.<br />  I cannot say that I particularly like the taste of coconut water, but it has the nutritional potassium I need in my diet, and is easier to keep around than bananas and has less calories.

The price is a huge savings, and I no longer have to carefully ration my use of the teabags in fear that I'll run out and not be able to get more. If you're trying to avoid caffeine and think that means settling for less robust taste in your favorite hot beverages, try decaf Constant Comment. The blend of clove, orange, etc., in real tea (not herbal tea) tastes as good as it smells (which is very aromatherapeutic!).

It is hard to find this decaf variation of the product in some stores, and it usually is more expensive than on Amazon even with shipping. Sometimes you can get free shipping, so I have bought by the case through Amazon.

review/summary: Constant Comment Tea is a favorite!
review/text: Constant Comment Tea has been a favorite of mine for many years and it's a plus that it comes decaffeinated. The flavor is unique and just a perfect combination of fruit and spices. If you haven't tried Constant Comment Tea yet, I highly recommend you do. I like getting the pack of 6 boxes through the Super Saver program. Since I drink a lot of tea, this is the most affordable way to purchase it that I've found.

review/text: True Himalayan Pink Salt.  I won't bore you with all the wonderful benefits of this mineral-rich salt.  I'll figure you won't be here if you aren't already aware of them.<br /><br />This is excellent, rich, pink salt.  It is ground very well, and is suitable for use as both kitchen and table salt. It has a nice flavor and works perfectly in all our recipes. If you plan to store it in a shaker, you want to add some uncooked rice in with it, or it will lump badly.  It is very fine, so it absorbs all the moisture, without rice to help it.<br /><br />We love the quality of this brand, and will buy more, and more. :)

review/text: I bought this salt after reading Suzanne Somer's books. It turned out to be great because this salt does contain more minerals than "NA/CL", meaning you get a supply of important nutrients and does not have to ingest anti-caking ingredients in regular salt. But I do not know if Himalayan does supply iodine. The food tastes great, you can feel the difference. Great product!!

review/summary: Best Tasting Salt AND So Incredibly Good For You
review/text: This is the best tasting salt I've ever had.  I learned about this after starting a "raw" diet and I was obsessed about having everything raw.  I'm a condiment queen and it was really hard for me to give up a lot of my condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo).  I was never a salt user - I'm a self-described fresh pepper addict and connoisseur.  However, once I realized this salt was raw, all natural and got great reviews, I decided to try it.  This really does enhance almost every dish I eat.  In addition, there are a ton of articles online explaining why this 200 million year old natural nutrient is so very good for us.  Move over table salt with your history of ridicule and side effects; move in Himalayan salt.

Next time it will be more.<br /><br />This salt is also a great for exfoliation in the bath!<br /><br />One note: do be sure to add several grains of uncooked rice to the package as soon as you open it. It does start to clump rather quickly.

review/summary: Product not as described
review/text: Package arrived in time.  I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.  The salt was more like rock salt - the crystals being slightly larger than what you find in kosher salt.  I have to dilute it with water before I can consume it.  If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food.  This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid. The package it is in is also labeled "finely ground".<br /><br />I use it for cooking - where I have no problems with it.  The three stars are only because the salt was not what I would consider finely ground.

review/summary: Delicious Nutritious Non-nuclear Salt at a Great Price
review/text: I love salt and use a variety of salts to keep my blood pressure up in the normal range.<br /><br />This salt, I think, may be the same as that sold by David Wolfe's LongevityWarehouse but you get twice as much for roughly the same price.  Not only are the descriptions similar, but comparing the salts side-by-side, they have the exact same color, flavor, texture, grind, fragrance, etc in my opinion.<br /><br />Himalayan salt is definitely much cleaner than sea salt ever since the Fukushima plant began leaking radiation into the Pacific Ocean last year if not before.  Many people are unaware of this because the major television stations are not broadcasting information that would incriminate their owners but just google or YouTube search if you want to know what is happening and what your government is not doing about it.  I definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like ENENews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth.  If the sea salt wasn't harvested before Fukushima started dumping nuclear waste, it is just too risky to ingest.<br /><br />This salt is from the Himalayas which may be just as far from Fukushima's dumping ground as you can get!

review/summary: SALTY  SALT I HAVE EVER TASTED
review/text: This salt is pink in colour and upon recieveing it I used a tooth pick and dampened the end of the tooth pick and stuck the tip, JUST THE TIP, of the tooth pick into the pink looking salt and tasted it, and WOW! The salt taste about knocked me off my feet! The 2 pounds of this salt will last a very long time! I can use a lot less to salt whatever I want to have a salted flavour. It takes very little sprinkled on food or when cooking to obtain the desired salt flavour. It is great salt and it will last much longer than normal every day salt from the grocery store down town that I usualy buy for 78 cents to a dollar something. I recomend all people give this salt a try. As far as Iodine as a nessary nutriant, just eat potatoes ever so often and you will get the nessary iodine that you need in your diet, so no worries there. I can not wait to try this Himalayan Salt on Popcorn. I have been very un-satisfied with the normal every day salt from the store for a long time. Even sea salt has no "punch" to it like this salt. This is salt as it was meant to be and taste. (my opinion)

review/summary: good salt, good price, but not fine!
review/text: I got this to hold us over because our usual supplier was sold out right when we needed more Himalayan salt. The quality is good, but the salt is most certainly NOT finely ground. The crystals are the same size as previous Himalayan salt that we purchased in the past, which is coarser than regular table salt. When described as finely ground, I was expecting smaller sized crystals. Our usual supplier is in stock again, so I probably won't be purchasing this brand again if not necessary. But the price is pretty good and the quality seems fine, so I would recommend this to people who are looking to try Himalayan salt.

review/text: I bought this as an alternative to the sea salts that I normally purchase.  I find that the salt does not dissolve fully - it leaves a gritty residue behind, whether in sauces, soups, pickles or pasta water.  The flavor is fine, and when cooked in dishes the grit doesn't seem to be an issue, but I like my salts to be versatile, and this one doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I've got a Himalayan pink salt cooking plate, and I'm quite satisfied with that, but I don't use any liquid when cooking with it.

review/text: I went to the Sunflower Market in Dallas and got a bag of Real salt from Utah. It is way better in flavor than chemical salt however the dirt and sand are off putting! You see, I add salt to all my drinking water and right away noticed real salt was leaving a sand-looking substance at the bottom of the bottle so I could only drink 80% of the water before re-filling. Real salt is the laziest company I know for not using an evaporation/filtering process to remove the dirt and sand!<br /><br />I am now the happy new owner of 4 lbs of Himalayan salt and it's not only clean unlike real salt, it tastes 10 levels better too! The company also has something like 200 different salts for your salt tasting pleasure! I will be ordering much more and sending as a gift to all my friends and family! This stuff is the "real" deal unlike Real LOL. Real salt should use as their motto "Hey, just tryin' to keep it real"<br />LOL ...losers

review/summary: Smoking Fish
review/text: I have found that when I smoke fish, this salt improves the taste of the smoke and the fish. When I smoke Salmon, I will dry rub this salt on to the fish 8 hours before I hot smoke it with hickory.  Himalayan salt taste is quite unique and the flavor it imparts to smoked meats and fish is very good.  It is not at all bitter as some other salts are.

review/summary: Pine Salt
review/text: Perfectly ground Himalayan salt or pink salt.  This was recommended by a holistic practioner and is stronger tasting than regular salt.  I use this salt for all my salt uses including cooking but cut the amount in half since it is so salty.  This salt is not processed like other salts so is not iodized if you need that process.  We like it much better that our regular table or kosher salt.

While I am not qualified to attest to the quality of this salt, I feel good having it in my kitchen, and will definitely repurchase. There is something about Himalayan Salt that makes me confident having it.

review/text: I had been looking for this for a while and hadn't been able locate it locally. I prefer it over sea salt or kosher. It is amazingly smooth with slight but perceptible mineral notes in the flavor. Kosher type salts seem to have a sharper edge to the taste. I highly recommend it for steaks or grilled salmon. It also gives a unique flavor and appearance to margaritas. Wonderful product.

review/text: This has a much saltier taste than table salt or even sea salt. I think I like sea salt better than this stuff, but that is quite probably just personal preference. I find that sea salt has more of a mouth watering quality, whereas this salt is more of a sharp saltiness.<br /><br />It would be excellent for desserts - like salt water taffy or a salty caramel.

review/summary: Couldn't be more pleased!
review/text: One reviewer  described The spice Lab Finely Ground Himalayan Salt  grains as being too  being large.  Not mine.  Mine  is finer than course kosher salt.<br /> I ordered a small package first to check it out and now I am ready to spring for a big one.<br /> It seems to take less salt,  it's easy to control with your "pinches", and it tastes great!<br /><br /> I love the consistency of this Himalayan.  It is in no way as fine as table salt but somewhere in between table and Kosher - leaning more to the Kosher.  Maybe half as fine as course Kosher.<br />  Some salts I have bought have just been too fine for me to predict how much salt I'm really adding.  I'm not good with really finely ground salts and end up over salting or under salting.<br /> I like to see each individual grain of salt if you will...and I can with this  Himalayan.<br /><br />I couldn't be more pleased and the price is good too.  Came in great shape nicely packaged...
