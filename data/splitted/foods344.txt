review/summary: England's Favorite Is Mine Too
review/text: I have been drinking PG Tips tea for almost 20 years and have found it to be consistently a more pleasurable tea than any of the others I have tried. While there are many teas to chose from in grocery stores, PG Tips is the only one I find worth going the extra effort to obtain elsewhere.<br />I recommend that anyone try it, you'll see.

review/summary: Poor quality tea and very cheap packaging
review/text: I found this tea to be weak and bitter. Also, all the tea bags, which are in gimmicky triangled shaped tea bags are packed loose in the cardboard box so there's a bunch of loose tea in the bottom of the box. Accordingly, to keep it fresh, one needs to put the bags into an airtight canister or zip lock bag. To have 240 tea bags packed loosely in a cardboard box is just simply poor packaging. The tea arrived somewhat stale and even if it had not, it would have become stale in short order.<br /><br />I see this has received a lot of positive reviews. I've not read them and my review is not influenced by them in anyway. I would never buy this tea again and could not in good conscience recommend it. Perhaps I'm picky but there are too many really good black teas available to, in my humble opinion, ever give this product consideration.

review/summary: Not Strong Enough!!! Lacks Full Flavors & Sophistication
review/text: Ok, I've been drinking a variety of hot teas usually with cream & a tad of sugar since the late 1970's... before that iced tea...<br /><br />Amazon did sell this at an excellent price 'IF' you subscribe & it arrived promptly with a VERY FRESH date... expiration in 2013 for best flavor (bought in August 2011).<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea is too weak & too smooth... I have to use 3 tea bags per 10-11oz cup of water to get some strength infused into it for 10 minutes! I recommend Lifeboat Tea (also from UK) over this or Scottish Breakfast if you want even more strength & full flavors.<br /><br />If you don't want strong Full Flavors or Sophistication, then this tea is a buy for smooth & subtle drinking... good for a tea party... to eat little cakes & scones with it. Better it be Lifeboat or Scottish Breakfast, imo, for my tea parties. :-)<br /><br />Right now, my ideal blend would be a combination blend of Scottish Breakfast AND Lifeboat... Lifeboat needs a tiny kick of strength & flavor from the Scottish tea... that's my perfect cuppa tea...<br /><br />If you know a better stronger blend that can top that combo taste, then please comment to this post... and Thanks!!!

review/summary: Briton's #1 Tea - PG Tips
review/text: The folks in the United Kingdom drink more PG Tips tea than any other brand, and perhaps after you try it; it will be your #1 choice, too! (By the way, the folks in Ireland drink more tea per person than in any other country.)<br /><br />PG Tips Tea and PG Tips Special Blend Tea is our home's standard tea. There are a few specialty retailers in the USA that now offer the PG Tips Special Blend Tea and hopefully Amazon will do so soon.<br /><br />In the 1930s (the pre-digestive era in history) this tea was introduced by the name "Pre-Gest-Tee" suggesting the tea could be consumed before food was eaten, but it was the grocers who gave it the abbreviation of "PG" - and the company added "tips" (since the company uses only the best part of the tea plant, the two top leaves and bud of the tea plant to make the tea).<br /><br />Many black teas sold in the USA are graded the basic medium grade Orange Pekoe (generally the tea leaves below the top two and bud), which is one of the reasons PG Tips gets higher reviews than most other teas. PG Tips also uses their pyramid tea bag that allows ample room for the tea to expand as it is infused. Additionally, in my opinion, PG Tips blends only two blends, rather than blending a wide assortment, thus becoming really good at what they do.<br /><br />Here at Amazon PG Tips is priced at just over a nickel a tea bag (a good value for an imported product) when you order the 240 count boxes in a set of two, and even less expensive in the higher volumes. PG Tips makes wonderful ice tea too, and that's good news since Americans drink about 80% of their tea as iced tea and only 20% as hot tea. Worldwide more hot tea is consumed than iced tea, and worldwide tea is the most consumed beverage (next to water), while in the USA it is the sixth most consumed beverage (next to water).<br /><br />A very good question to ponder is "Why this is?"<br /><br />Drinking an adequate amount of tea daily is now being considered to be very good for one's health, and it is much more enjoyable to drink a really good cuppa (cup of tea), especially at the nominal cost of about a nickel a cup when compared to one of those gourmet coffee places who charge upwards of four to five dollars for a large cup of coffee.<br /><br />When we have a guest in our home we always offer them a PG Tips cuppa, and they always say they have never tasted a tea this good - thus, I rate it 5 stars for its quality and very nominal price!

review/summary: A fine and sturdy everyday tea
review/text: This is a very drinkable blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips, one of the UK's most popular brands. Although some California grocery stores stock this tea, I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag (that is available in the USA). As expected, PG Tips makes a stronger brew. Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag.<br /><br />PG Tips is a sturdy, straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton's. It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands.<br /><br />PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. Does it make better tea? I don't know, but it is a point of differentiation.<br /><br />HINT: PG Tips also makes a Special Blend black tea that is only slightly more expensive in stores. I much prefer the Special Blend to their regular black tea. The PG Tips Special Blend is a very hardy and rich breakfast tea. The Special Blend is more sensitive to longer steeping times (I usually steep mine less than 3 minutes), but I find the taste more complex and satisfying.<br /><br />Many prefer loose tea because tea bags contain the less expensive "fannings" or "dust," remains from processing loose leaf tea. And with some others brands of tea (not PG Tips), some people can taste the paper used in the bag.<br /><br />If you (like I) sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags, I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea. And, I more strongly recommend their Special Blend as a hardy and rich breakfast tea.

review/summary: Strong, FAST and affordable
review/text: PG Tips processes the tea leaves so brewing is reduced to mere seconds and, in my experience, there is zero bitterness, even if something happens so I have to let the bag sit in the hot water until it cools.<br /><br />This is what I do for "nearly instant" brewed iced tea at the office:  Mostly fill a large glass (24 oz) with ice cubes, slowly pour very hot water over 1 PG Tips bag in a small mug (8 oz). [I use the hot water spigot on the coffee machine.] Immediately pour the hot brew over the ice. If needed, top up glass with cold water. Stir to mix and chill thoroughly.  Voila! "instant" iced tea.<br />Each bag contains a relatively substantial amount of tea, so I keep the bag in the heatproof mug so I can savor 2 full-flavored glasses from one bag. Comparing myself to acquaintances, as well as published recipes, I like my tea strong, so this is significant. (UPDATE: I ran out of PG so got a box of Twinings at Walgreens, took 2 bags to make one glass--same mug and glass as above--and had to let it steep 4 minutes before it smelled "done". So I guess this means PG is 4 times fuller-flavored than Twinings & infinitely quicker to brew.)<br /><br />A connoisseur would probably snub this product (simple, "sweet leaf" with no complexity); to my mind, this is the only shortcoming. That said, it still produces a wonderful cup for the everyday and workaday: full-bodied in the mouth and very satisfying. I don't need to add any sweetening or flavoring. Terrific by itself AND robust enough to enjoy with food. Makes excellent kombucha, too.<br /><br />Great stuff!<br /><br />Really pleased with the price here on Amazon. Local stores only stock small boxes, which work out to be 14x (!!) the unit price of this item. (UPDATE: December 2009, Unable to find any local sources.)

review/text: I lived in England for a short time and was introduced to PG Tips there.  Since returning to the states, I can't stand American tea.  It's like drinking hot brown dirty water!  PG Tips is rich and satisfying, a cup of comfort.  You immediately see the difference when you pour the hot water over the bag.  The color is dark and the essence is intoxicating.  I have it with milk and sugar and it puts me in a relaxed and warm state of mind.  I can never go back to that other tea!  Believe me, there is a vast and improved difference you will appreciate to the fullest.  A most satisfying cup of tea.

review/summary: REAL TEA!!! Classic British flavor
review/text: I grew up in Scotland, and I remember drinking 2 or 3 cups of tea a day, even as a child.  When my family and I came to the US and tasted Lipton Tea, we almost died! It didn't taste anything like "our" tea.  PG Tips has a smooth and very pleasant flavor, without being weak. So I must say, I am very happy to be able to purchase PG Tips at a very reasonable price from Amazon. My family used to have to have tea sent over from our relatives in the UK before Amazon was around! :)  Whenever friends come over and they try it, they ask what it is, thinking its some "high end" expensive loose leaf tea, so they are suprised when they see it comes in a bag.<br /><br />The flavor can be very strong if left to steep for a long time, but as with everything, it depends on each person's preference as to what they like.  I believe this tea is best suited to drink with milk, however it is also pleasant with a little sugar and slice of lemon.  Just remember, when making tea, to use BOILING WATER. I see so many people make tea with hot water, and it just doesn't taste the way it should when made that way.  If you don't believe me, make a cup with each type of water and test it yourself, I think you'll be very surprised.<br /><br />I highly recommend PG Tips, and have not found it less expensive than Amazon's price anywhere else.

review/summary: Pg Tips or Yorkshire Gold a Comparison
review/text: PG tips gets a five from me and So does Yorkshire Gold (made famous on the HOMELAND TV SERIES probably prodct placement). I also vote for amazon getting the PG Special Blend (First introduced for PG's 75th Annivesary) PG in terms of tea is a new company that is blending fine teas to a current audience.<br />  Pg tips is mild yet Malty tea and I use boiling water and steep only 3 minutes to get a great cup of tea.Steeping longer brings out the bitterness.Some people love leaving the tea bag in but I think you loose the subtle flavors that way and it does get bitter.Yorkshire gold is brewed the same way.If you have an old Krups Tea Time brewer you get the very best taste possible using loose or bag tea some people swear by loose tea as the tea is a courser cut.One other secret that makes a difference is use filtered water .I use an inexpensive PUR filter that attaches to my faucet saving a lot of money in purchasing bottled water and works fine for tea.<br />It doesnt strip out the minerals leaving the water chlorine free but alkaline. You dont want a neutral water as in a PH7 as it tastes acid to your tongue even though it is not.Try some distilled water you will immediately see what I mean.<br /><br />  PG TIPS is close to many cheaper brands but worth the extra money ( we are talking pennies per bag) over Grandmas favorite Red Rose Tea.PG is a little cheaper where I shop then Yorkshire Gold. Even after three minutes Yorkshire Gold gets a touch more Bitter. Bitter is a preference just like in beer. If you like bitter beer you will like Yorkshire Gold Better.<br /><br />  Let me give you a comparision to coffee which I also love. If you like a dark roast like Starbucks the Yorkshire Gold will probably be a better choice. If you like an American Roast like Dunkin Donuts -Tim Hortins- then PG tips is a better choice.<br />  Again by a nose PG tips makes a better Iced Tea especially if you like to add Lemon to your Ice Tea.This I brew by pouring a hot filtered water of about 150 degrees F (boiling the water works also just dont steep as long) into a gallon jug with 5 tea bags in it I let this steep longer and check it every  half hour until done.Usually the color of a REAL Maple syrup. This may seem time consuming and it is not. It becomes quickly second nature.Do not squeeze the tea bags when removing them unless you like bitter tea. I sometimes substitute one of the tea bags for iced tea with a quality Organic Green Tea bag and that gives a good iced tea taste as well.You also get the extra antioxidents in Green tea.( both teas are antioxident rich)<br />  PG tips is the #1 one selling tea in England and they know tea. I have been a professional Coffee roaster who was forced to flavor coffee with artificial flavors to be competitive.The natural flavors ( the few available ) cost 5 times more so were to expensive to use.So to the fellow who likes flavored tea, who only gave a 3 star rating just make sure its 100% natural flavors in those other teas.Everything else is a chemistry set.

review/summary: Quality is ok, Flavor isn't fantastic.
review/text: The Good: PG Tips tastes a little like an earl grey and can be bought in bags or loose leaf. It tastes noticeably different than standard brands like Lipton. It can be found in smaller packages at most supermarkets in America. All PG Tips products seem to be reasonably priced.<br /><br />The Bad: I personally do not like the flavor. I am used to drinking loose leaf teas and am open to trying any kind of tea or herbal infusion, but until a friend said that this tastes a bit like earl grey to them I didn't think I would ever finish the box. Strangely, when I think about it that way it actually doesn't taste as bad, but it's still not the greatest.<br /><br />Other notes:<br />I've tried this on a recommendation from a friend. I bought the loose leaf variety because I normally prefer loose leaf teas. I can't imagine that the bagged variety would taste noticeably different to your average tea drinker, but I highly doubt that it has exactly the same flavor.<br /><br />If you're used to plain tea (black tea) brewed from bags (like lipton or bigalow) and you are looking for something different to try then go for it, but buy a small box just to try at your local supermarket. But if you appreciate higher quality whole leaf teas from reputable tea merchants, then this isn't your cup of tea ;)

review/summary: Some of the BEST tea I've tasted
review/text: I talked with an English person about tea, and she told me "You can't go wrong with PG Tips!" The reason she said that is because you cannot go wrong with this stuff. Overall, this is some of the best tea I've tasted and has real flavor. I almost forgot to mention that this stuff is actually from England and has less caffeine than other teas.

review/summary: OK but Tetley tastes better to me!
review/text: I lived in the UK for many years (over 30)<br />And used to like PG Tips but I recently tried it as I found some cheap at Biglots!<br />All I can say is that the readily available Tetley "British Blend" tasted much better with a stronger taste with a bit of a kick to it - yummy!<br />The PG tasted somewhat bland in comparison, I'll be sticking to Tetley. I can't remember what I liked back in England...

review/text: This tea is very strong, but doesn't have any delicate flavor that you could enjoy with best and expensive sorts of tea, like indian Darjeeling or chinese Yunnan.<br />You will not find here a fine nuances of taste and aftertaste.<br />PG Tips is very simple. This is a minus.<br /><br />By other hand, PG Tips has a normal flavor of indian BLACK tea, unlike the most others bag's teas smelling by green tea or just by hay.<br />PG Tips is simple, but honest. This is a plus.

review/summary: Very disappointed - broken package poor flavor
review/text: I drink tea every day. When my regular English Breakfast stock ran out, I ordered this item based on Amazon user reviews, which have always been reliable. How disappointed I was!<br /><br />The package I bought is sold by "MarJam LLC", the larger outside box came in perfect shape. However when I opened it, the two tea boxes inside looked crushed and broken in corners. It was clear they were already broken before being put into the delivery box, it's hard to believe somebody will knowingly ship crushed boxes to customers. As I tried to clean up the tapes and wrapping, dark tea power made a complete mess in the kitchen.<br /><br />At that point I was still hopeful, after all it's the tea not the packaging we buy. Unfortunately the first taste didn't do much for me, it was nothing special, less flavorful than a lot of regular brands. There were two things that should serve as indicators: 1) I looked at the expiry date it's in 2011, no manufacturing date shown; 2) Each large thin paper box holds 240 loose bags, compared to some other brands that have much better packaging to preserve the flavor. The regular 48 bag box I buy has two foil packs inside.<br /><br />To summarize, I got two big crushed boxes for a total of 480 loose tea bags, some of them are in power form no longer contained in bags. They lack flavor as of now. Unless I drink them in a few months, they will expire in 2011.<br /><br />I couldn't have been more disappointed.

Perhaps it would be useful to have a 'disagree' choice which is what many mean when they find something is not 'helpful.'

review/text: I am from West Bengal, India. I grew up with finest quality Darjeeling and Assam tea. I never got such good tea here in the US. All the glowing reviews made me buy this tea thinking that I would at last find a good tea. The tea is simply horrible. I am not sure how the other buyers are making this tea but this tea is far from strong and it has no flavor. Two packs of simple Lipton tea make a better cup. Don't waste your money on this one.

review/summary: absolute crap tea
review/text: If you liked this tea, you back to drinking your coffee. Obviously you don't know what tea is about.<br /><br />This tea has very strong aroma when you first open it. However this aroma is not of natural origin, the added chemical scent destroyed the original smell. Giving this tea bag a few dips in 80 degree c hot water (which is how hot the water should be at) this tea is low grade at best. It does not give a soothing taste after you drink it rather it leaves bitter taste all over. Also, for people who like strong tea tastes, this tea bag has nothing of that. Granted it is black tea, but black tea being roasted the longest out of tea leaves should have a strong taste.<br /><br />Those 5 star raters need to have their tongues checked. If you liked those tea sampled at Teavana, you got problems.

review/text: When we were in London three years ago, I loved the tea I was served at a hotel breakfast.  I asked the waitress what brand it was so that I could buy some and take it back home.  She returned from the kitchen and said, "It's just PG Tips."  I didn't have a chance to buy any before coming home, but did buy it from Amazon upon our return.  Shortly after starting to drink it daily, my husband and I became very jittery.  We mentioned it to our doctor who is British and she said, "You can't drink that! It's too strong for Americans."  We continue to buy it from Amazon, in bulk, but now we use one teabag per teapot (3 to 4 cups) instead of one per cup, to cut down on caffeine.  It's still good.  And recently we purchased the decaf bags to have in the evening.

review/text: PG Tips is the best tea in all of Britain. I love it because it is top quality tea, possessing a smooth, satisfying flavour that is consistent with every cup. It's not fancy tea - it's real tea for real people. I drink it all day long from sunup to sundown and it makes a perfect cup of tea everytime. It can be hard to find here in the United States and tends to be expensive so I like to purchase it in bulk here on Amazon. I highly recommend this brand of tea.

review/summary: I'm no tea snob, so this is just my uneducated opinion.
review/text: Like most Americans, I've never been a regular hot tea drinker. After a lifetime of trying to like Twinings & Lipton dregs, now I know why! Others have pointed out the origins of the tea used in US brands, which makes it easy to see why we, as a people, don't drink hot tea.<br /><br />PG Tips is wonderful tea. The second you pour boiling water over it, you'll smell the difference. PG has a complex aroma and smooth flavor with no bitterness, even when strongly brewed. I use 3 bags steeped for 5 minutes in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GLRFCE">Brown Betty 24-Ounce Teapot</a>. Add Splenda and creamer -- heaven! (Told you, I'm uneducated!)<br /><br />PG has completely replaced coffee for me, and that's amazing for a (former) coffee fiend like me! I am totally addicted, and glad to find PG available on Amazon at a good price, with free shipping (no tax!) and auto-refill. Good deal!<br /><br />Oh yes, it makes great iced tea, too!

review/summary: Good, Strong, Black Tea
review/text: Having grown up in Australia and then moving to the USA to live, I have long missed a good cup of (hot) tea. But then I found PG Tips here at Amazon and I have been buying them ever since. Tip: check the number of tea bags and prices to determine the best deal.<br /><br />This is a strong Orange Pekoe tea (basic, medium-grade black tea), much stronger than anything I have found at retail in the US grocery stores. It *will* stain your pot or cups over time, but as many tea drinkers will tell you, this just makes for a better cup of tea. If this becomes unsightly, I take a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to the inside of the cup to remove the stain. According to the box, PG Tips is a British blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan teas.<br /><br />The pyramid shaped bag allows for more water flow and better steeping, which means more tea flavor from each bag. Make sure you boil your water to a rolling boil and steep for at least three minutes for maximum flavor (as with most black teas, longer steep times will result in a bitter taste because the release of tannin). I like to drink mine hot with a splash of milk, at all times of the day.

review/text: I recently started drinking PG Tips when I found it in the tea/coffee cabinet at the home of the family that I work for. They know I make tea for myself nearly everyday, so they are kind enough to keep tea in stock for me.  Being a young American, I had never heard of PG Tips until now, so I am sad that I have been in the dark for so long. The taste and "texture" of this tea is absolutely fabulous. I brew it for 2 minutes and it makes a perfect cup without any bitterness, but with a bold smooth flavor. I also add a splash of milk and a bit of sugar or honey... whatever is on hand. I am glad this is becoming widely available in the States and I can see this replacing my regular morning cup of Twinings. I can see why this is the "#1 tea in the UK."

review/text: Amazon bills this as black tea, which is technically correct but those familiar with Chinese and Indian teas also call this type "white tea." It is the tip end of the tea branches, the very best part. The rest of the plant is not considered choice at all. Basically they pick off the best parts and ship those to England while the USA's Lipton et. al. bag up the nasty leftovers and foist it off onto Americans, which is probably why we consume mostly coffee. If you enjoy a nice cup of tea, give P.G. Tips a try. Each teabag is large enough to brew a small potful, so it works out to be very economical.

review/text: PG Tips pyramid bags are the best for convenient brewing, two to a pot.  The 240-count package sits 9 inches tall, too tall for the cupboard where I keep the tea, so I kept one of the 160-count packages from the case I ordered last year and use it as a dispenser.  This tea is not for the fainthearted; it's dark and packs a caffeine punch.  Warm the pot, then brew for five minutes and (unless you're an iron gut) sweeten each cup with a cube of sugar and a dash of milk.  Gentler on the stomach than coffee, and if prepared as above, a healthy alternative.  I like both tea and well-brewed coffee, but find tea easier to manage.

review/summary: Avid tea drinker here: I will name names!
review/text: I have always been a hot tea drinker, and over the past 5 years black tea has become my favorite drink. I purchased my first box of PG Tips at a local store after reading some reviews here. I thought to myself,  "I am sure it's good, but I'm an experience tea drinker and should not expect it to exceed some of the brands I already drink." Given the higher price of PG Tips, as expected, I found it FAR superior to regular Lipton, Walmart's Great Value Brand, and Lipton Black Pearl. It also surpasses similarly priced teas like Twinings, Stash and Tazo. What really surprised me is that it is solidly better (albeit not by huge margins) than more expensive teas like Numi and Mighty Leaf. So what makes it better? Firstly, it's smooth, aromatic and satisfying in a way the others are not. Secondly, as tea begins to cool a bit, the other brands' taste (especially the cheaper ones) begins to become a little off-putting. I find that with PG Tips even as it cools a little, I do not rush to finish the cup since it maintains its taste. I just purchased the 240 count two pack and recommend PG TIps to all tea drinkers.

review/text: I first discovered PG Tips when I was researching what kind of tea one of my British characters would have imported to the Midwestern university where he reigned as President. (Dudley, from This Brilliant Darkness <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1466368039">This Brilliant Darkness</a>) That was when I discovered that PG Tips was the best-selling British tea. Upon editing, that detail got cut, but I never forgot.<br /><br />A few years later, I was delighted to find PG Tips on the shelf of my local grocery, in the imported foods section. I bought some to try, because I am a tea "whore." I always have upward of two dozen varieties of tea in the house at any given time--a situation that my then-coffee-addicted, then-boyfriend Tim found ridiculous.<br /><br />As soon as Tim tried PG Tips, all that changed.<br /><br />I now subscribe to recieve two extra-large boxes of PG Tips every few months. Tim takes a box to work and uses the rest here. He can't live without it. Also, we are extremely happily married, and he spoils me with whatever I want. Coincidence?  I think not.<br /><br />I have consequently become addicted to K Cups--but that's a different story.<br /><br />For the record, this & Earl Grey are the only teas Tim likes...so me and my 22 other varieties go the iced tea route & don't try to come between him & his Elixir of Life.<br /><br />Thank you, PG Tips, for making our lives complete.

review/summary: Great tasting tea at a Great price
review/text: PG Tips Black Tea was a very good choice to purchase. I have purchased numerous brands of black teas as I prefer the flavor of black tea over other teas for its stronger flavor. I've always drank Lipton tea iced and use six teabags from Lipton to make 1 gallon of tea. With PG Tips, I find three to four is enough or it's TOO strong but as always taste is based on personal preference. Upon reading all the five star reviews for PG Tips tea, I said OK...going to buy this tea and try it. Coming from England, I expected great flavor and quality and that's exactly what PG Tips was and is. My first impression is it tasted identical to Lipton, I can't really tell a difference between PG Tips or Lipton from the US because it taste exactly the same! The only difference I can tell is I use less teabags for making a gallon of tea with PG Tips than Lipton, why this is I am still trying to figure out. Possibly because they use only the two tips of the tea and a bud? Not sure...but PG Tips is my new tea from England! Enjoy.

review/summary: I'm smitten!
review/text: I have had my eye on this brand of tea for quite a while, I just never wanted to spend the money on it.  Don't you just love the Friday Deals???  So, since the price was awesome, I decided to splurge.  I do not regret it!  I am now an official PG Tips tea fan!  The flavor is so great... smooth, but oh so flavorful!  I usually drink coffee, but occasionally get on a tea kick.  Let's just say that I could totally quit coffee and switch to PG Tips and not miss the coffee.  When I said that I usually drink coffee...let me go one step further and say that those people that know me, know to stay away from me first thing in the morning until I have at least 2 cups of coffee in my system.  I don't even know how to smile with out having my daily fix.  So, with that being said...that's how much I love this tea..that I could switch from coffee to tea and not miss it.

review/text: If you want a tea that is easy to get along with and has no tongue-torturing surprises, then PG Tips Black Tea is for you. No fancy oils or spices, just tea the way God and the British Empire intended it to be. I started drinking it decades ago and it's still my favorite. Avoid the odd-tasting "Special Blend" and stick with the stuff in the white/blue/green box with the green "P" and red "G".

review/summary: The Best Tea for a great price!
review/text: If you're familiar with PG Tips, you know that it is "England's No. 1 Tea". There is a reason for that: while PG Tips is not the cheapest tea in all of England, it is an excellent product. Here in the USA, I have not found a better tea which can be both purchased in bulk and excellent. If you're used to purchasing your tea at an American grocery store, PG Tips will most certainly cost less than a "weak" American tea. Where I live in Wisconsin, some truly awful teas sell for the equivalent of 10 cents a bag! PG Tips is high-quality and low-priced, and that is why it's my favorite tea.

review/summary: Very Good Tea!!!
review/text: While this may not be "premium" tea, it IS very good tea. It has a smooth, not harsh, yet bold flavor. It stands up well to milk or cream and makes a very good iced tea. After drinking this, Lipton's tea just seems so unbearably harsh and acrid. It brews up well, never seeming to become bitter. It works well as a general, all purpose, every day tea; also, blending well with mint or other flavors, like cinnamon, if that's what you like. PG is good black, too. It is a finely cut tea, BUT, so what? It steeps well and tastes great. The tea bags are pyramid shaped, which does seem to brew better, probably because more of the bag and tea is in the water and less is floating.  Also, there is more bag surface exposed to the water.  The material the bag is constructed of is different than the usual bag.  It is softer with a more open weave, so again, water flows through better.  It does not leave a slight taste of the bag, as some other brands do. I searched high and low, for years, and paid way too much for stale PG Tips before finding it on Amazon at a very good price, especially when purchased at subscribe and save prices. I do prefer the loose tea, but occasionally use tea bags, for traveling. There are other teas I enjoy, but this remains on my list of favorites, both for taste and price!

review/text: I have loved tea since I was quite young and enjoyed drinking it out of my Grandmother's fine porcelain cups.  It started a lifelong quest to find unique and delicious teas!<br /><br />I had absolutely NO need to buy this particular tea because my cupboards are bulging with various flavors and brands - but I HAD to!  Of all places - this was served to me at my favorite Mexican restaurant!<br /><br />Hubby and I eat there weekly and usually the owners like to treat us to an after-meal cappuccino - but the brother who makes them wasn't there one night, so another of the family offered to make us some "special" tea - and indeed special it IS, as he had brought a personal stash of it back from Spain.  He served it to us with half & half - what a lovely, robust drink!<br /><br />I immediately got on my favorite on-line merchant's site and found that indeed, PG Tips could be had through Amazon - so wasted no time in ordered.<br /><br />I drink this almost to the exlusion of all my others now and will most definitely reorder when I run low.

review/summary: Very good, and a lot of it
review/text: If you haven't bought a 240 count package of tea before, let me tell you how much it is.  A lot.  That's how much.  This is the church's morning tea supply for the next few months.<br /><br />The pyramid teabag is very nice.  The bag material appears to be a standard tea bag like the kind used by Celestial Seasonings, but the four corners of the bag were formed into a pyramid instead of a square.  A tea bag, of course, will retain some air as it is steeped.  A square tea bag will float flat on the surface of the water.  A pyramid, on the other hand, floats as an upside down pyramid.  I don't know why the air doesn't collect in one of the corners, but it doesn't.  Bottom line: the rest of the bag, and thus the tea, is submerged, which makes for a (in my opinion) much better steep than a square bag.<br /><br />The tea itself is quite enjoyable, although I am not a connoisseur by any means.  I use one bag in the morning to make about a liter of tea, then down it with a big breakfast.  This tea is not as in-your-face earthy as the last black tea I tried (a Yorkshire blend), and I like it better.  It still has that earth and slightly bitter flavor, but it is a little sweeter than the Yorkshire blend I tried, probably because it is made from the tips of the plant, as the product name states, or perhaps it came from a different and better crop, or some other reason that I do not know.  I am not one to add anything to my tea for sweetening or any other alteration, so I prefer this tea.<br /><br />There's just a ton of it.  Two-hundred forty tea bags in an absurd quantity.

review/text: I love PG Tips and have been drinking it for over 15 years. No other tea even comes close to the delicious flavor. It's full-bodied without being bitter. Another great thing about the tea bags is there's no string stapled to the bag and no little paper bit to fall into the tea. These bags are pyramid shaped and the paper the bags are made of is very strong.<br /><br />I used to boil water in a kettle and pour it into the cup, but after burning up three kettles, I now microwave my tea. Just pop a bag in a mug of water and microwave on high for 2 minutes 15 seconds. The bag does not burst and it tastes just as good as pouring boiling water over the bag in a mug.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: As good as it gets.
review/text: PG Tips is a little more expensive than domestic brands, but it's worth every penny.  I've tried every other brand and none compared.  It's strong enough to add milk and sugar and still taste the tea flavor.  The color is rich and inviting instead of weak and grey.

review/summary: Partial to Kenyan tea.
review/text: If you like a good strong, flavorful tea, this is for you. It's a blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan tea.  I was delighted with the Kenyan tea when I visited there and have continued my preference. I always carry bags with me when I travel. I  buy a supply when I go to the UK, so was delighted to find I can order it through Amazon.

review/summary: Tea, proper English Tea.
review/text: What more can a person ask for when they have a good cuppa in their hand?<br />The boxes may be huge and the subscription of getting two big boxes of tea might sound like you are ready to open a tea room but it isn't.  The tea is fresh so it will last a fair amount of time and the price is the best I have found short of walking into an ASDA in the UK!  480 Tea bags is not that much when you do the math.  One in the morning, another around lunch, and another in the afternoon, three bags a day (so far). Then a friend pops by and there goes two bags, if they stay a while another or two, lets count two bags once a week for friends.  That makes 21 for the regular week, add two more you have 23. One box lasts 10 weeks, and if you have friends over after church the extra 10 goes quick. So this is only 20 weeks of tea, and it is still fresh and before the best by date!<br />I am retired Military and can shop on base.  The tea on base is not as fresh as these, and the price is more also.<br />Again, I ask, What more can a person ask for when they have a good cuppa in their hand?

review/summary: PG Tips, warms the heart of any ex-Brit
review/text: There really isn't much I can say.  If you've had PG Tips you know the difference.  If you haven't you don't know what your missing.<br /><br />I'm from the UK originally and for years in the States I drank Lipton as it was the only brand I could readily find.  But along came Amazon and restored my access to my favorite tea.<br /><br />If you're used to drinking Lipton, PG TIps has a stronger flavor and if you brew it real strong it can get bitter on you.  However I used to use 2 Lipton bags to get the strength I like and just one PG Tips bag does the job nicely.<br /><br />If you're not sold, wait until it goes on sale or special and at least try one box.  Its particularly good if you brew it in a proper ceramic or china teapot rather than making it directly in a cup.<br /><br />Actually that is one thing to note.  These tea bags don't have little strings so make sure you've got something handy to fish them out with.<br /><br />From an Eco-friendly perspective I also like the fact that you only have the tea bags and the main box they come in.  Only the plastic shrink wrap is not recyclable.  If you drink a lot of tea using individually wrapped tea bags you are going to be generating a lot of unnecessary waste.  Particularly for those teas in plastic envelopes.  At least in Lipton's favor they do use paper wrappers you can recycle.

review/summary: Mmmm nice cuppa tea!
review/text: Being a Brit ex-pat living in the states, I can honestly say, if it wasn't for my PG Tips I would've gone back home years ago!!  lol  My Mum used to mail me my PG Tips, used to cost her a fortune.  When I found PG Tips on Amazon I couldn't miss the opportunity of buying them myself - they are actually cheaper than my Mum can get them!  They arrive on my doorstep every two months.<br />PG Tips have got to be THE BEST t-bags you can find!  A lovely cuppa tea!

review/summary: A taste of home
review/text: Moving to the USA from the UK there are a few necessities that you need to have in your new home and tea is one of them.<br />PG Tips are up there in the top few teas regardless of what any other tea maker tells you.<br /><br />Perfect brew in a cup<br />Put one of the tea bags in a cup or mug<br />Pour boiling hot water into the cup<br />Stir the water and tea bag a little to help the brewing<br />Add a bit of your preferred milk<br />Dunk the tea bag until it meets your tastes (darker the colour the stronger the tea flavour). Some like it milky, some like it strong or without milk.<br />Remove tea bag and stir<br /><br />Add sugar or sweetners based on preference if you want.<br /><br />A great taste of "home" while abroad.

review/text: Primarily a hot tea drinker.  PG Tips is a full bodied drink, also make ice tea.  PG Tips can be compared to Yorkshire Tea bags, which makes a stronger brew.  I am very happy I have found a source.

review/text: Once you try it, nothing else will suffice. I went through a couple of boxes and now nothing else tastes close. Forget the garbage they sell in the supermarkets. If you like tea and don't want to mess with loose tea, this is the way to go.

review/summary: Delicatessen Champagne.
review/text: First off, I wanted to correct every bullet point in the product listing above.<br /><br />1. This is 4 six packs or 24 cans of soda, for a total of 288 ounces, not 48.  So, currently a little more than .60 a can.  Considering how difficult this product can be to find in certain geographical locations, this is to many people, quite a deal.  Much better than 3.61 a can anyway.<br /><br />2. The flavor has nothing at all to do with iced tea and I wouldn't describe Cel-Ray as "iced tea like" in the least.  It's much more comparable to ginger ale, or ginger beer.  It's less sweet than 7-UP or Sprite and more spicy or peppery with a mild, light vegetable undertone to it from the celery seed extract.<br /><br />3. While it's LESS sweet than most soft drinks on the market it's certainly sweet, as corn syrup is the second listed ingredient after carbonated water.  Granted they must use a lot less than regular soft drinks but it's plenty and Cel-Ray qualifies as "sweet."  It's also fairly strongly carbonated.  If pouring into a glass, you will see a light greenish-yellow color and a big, substantial head at the top of the glass.<br /><br />If you've never tried this before and it sounds iffy to you, you might want to taste test it first.  But for anyone with fond memories of pairing a Cel-Ray with a pastrami on rye, you already know how great they taste.  If you are a regular drinker of ginger beer or "hot" ginger ale then your tongue is ready for Cel-Ray.  This soda also makes a great mixer for Gin or Vodka.  It works pretty well for times when your stomach is upset too.  One of my all time favorites.

review/summary: Something different
review/text: You have ginger ale made from ginger, this is the same idea except made from celery. It isn't quite ginger ale, it isn't quite 7-up / Sprite, it is something in between. It might be a little odd the first time you have it, but it is addictive once you've acquired the taste! Too bad they don't make the diet version anymore, it was one of the few where it tasted the same as the regular.

review/text: There's two things in this world I just do not get: requests for mentorship in The Big Brother's of America program, and why more folks don't guzzle this stuff like Yoo-Hoo. The vegetable cola equivalent of Mary Hart's cankles. Yummy!<br /><br />(took off a star because I'm severely allergic to celery)
