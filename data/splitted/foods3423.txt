review/summary: A good way to introduce yourself to pu-erh tea.
review/text: Like strong cheese, and lambic beer, regular pu-erh teas are an acquired taste. Earthy, funky, musty and complex, all a bit too much for the beginner.  The Numi magnolia pu-erh, tones the pu-erh aspect down to a subtle level. Surprisingly, unlike most scented teas I've tried, the magnolia doesn't overpower either.<br /><br />The nose is rich, sweet and fruity/floral, the body is medium-to-full. The initial flavor is sweet, fruity and slightly floral, the pu-erh comes out in the finish, earthy, but tempered by the sweetness of the magnolia. As the sweetness fades, the pu-erh gains strength, but never too strong. The direction say to steep in boiling water, but I find the flavor is better with a slightly cooler water (185-200 degrees).<br /><br />If you're interested in trying pu-erh tea but are intimidated by its unusual flavor, this will give you a 'safe' introduction.

review/summary: A good tea, but needs less steeping than directions call for.
review/text: Numi teas are generally good quality, and this one is no exception.  It's a blend of green tea, black Puerh tea, and Magnolia flowers, which gives it a complex combination of flavors that's quite interesting, although heavy on the earthy well-fermented side.<br /><br />The directions call for steeping 2-4 minutes with boiling water, but I found that range to give a bitter brew heavy on the black tea tannins.  I had much smoother results that highlighted the magnolia and green tea elements by steeping for only 1 minute with boiling water.  It's even better when I let the boiling water cool for 2 minutes before pouring over the tea and steeping for another 2.

review/summary: This is not a green tea
review/text: I noticed that several reviewers compared this to green teas.  This is actually not a green tea; it is a blend of green tea and black tea.  I found it to be more characteristic of black tea, albeit with a soft, flowery aroma and suggestions of fruit and vanilla in the flavor that I think reflected the addition of the green tea (green and black teas are not different kinds; it just depends on how they are processed).<br /><br />I'm not quite a tea snob, but I probably come pretty close.  I drink tea every day, both iced and hot, and have for most of my life (my parents never thought children should have coffee, but we often drank tea).  I'm careful about how I steep my tea and use water of different temperatures and different brewing times for different teas, depending on their requirements for optimal flavor.  I have definite tea preferences, although they are wide ranging, and I buy many high-end teas (although good old Red Rose finds its way into my iced tea regularly).<br /><br />I found this a very pleasurable, very drinkable tea.  I brewed it with just-boiling water, as I would a black tea, but steeped it for only about 3 minutes (note that I like my tea dark).  It put me in mind of a darjeeling but was more complex and, I think, benefited from the smoothing influence of the green tea.  The earthiness that is claimed to be typical of Puerh tea was definitely present, but very mellow.<br /><br />This is my first experience with Puerh tea, so I did a little reading on it.  It really does have a long history and is one of the first Chinese teas; tea trees known to be more than 1000 years old are still growing and producing tea.  Puerh tea comes from the Yunnan province, one of the most ideal tea growing regions in the world.  It's reputed to dispel the effects of alcohol, help digestion, refresh the mind, and lower cholesterol and triglycerides (wow, what's not to like!)<br /><br />I don't know if it really does have greater health benefits than other teas, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to add it to my tea lineup, and I believe it will continue to hold a place there.  Actually, writing this review has made me want to drink it again, so I think I'll go brew a pot!

review/summary: Delicious, not bitter
review/text: Although this is a green tea, the color in the cup is a rusty brown. Because of that, I initially expected the flavor to have a high astringency and acid content, but even after steeping the tea for three minutes it was not bitter. In fact, the tea has a very nice, smooth taste. The magnolia flowers contribute a mild floral scent, but I'm not sure what they contribute to the flavor without also being able to taste this same tea without the magnolia. In any case, the floral essence isn't overpowering.<br /><br />This is a good tea for day-to-day drinking. The flavor isn't so unusual that I'd want to save it for occasional use; in fact, I've taken some to work and I enjoy having a cup in the afternoon.

review/text: This tea was superb. I used two bags in a four cup automatic tea maker on the mild setting the first time around. The tea came out perfect. The green tea flavor was subtle with a hint of magnolia. I drank mine unsweetened, the flavor was so good. I was able to use the same bags again by setting the automatic tea maker to the strongest flavor setting. The tea came out tasting the same. Definitely worth buying. I will be buying it again!

review/summary: Nice, Pleasant Green Tea.
review/text: I drink a lot of tea, have since I was a little kid.  Though growing up my mom would only drink herbals because she didn't like caffeine.  When I was about 20yrs, I met some friends who were obsessed with tea and taught me how to make loose-leaf tea, not the stupid bagged stuff.  The problem with bagged teas is that with bagged tea you get the worst, left-over part of the leaf, or dust, in those bags, so the quality of the tea is much lower than most loose-leaf teas.  Also with loose-leaf teas you have the option of buying bags you can use so you have your own bag tea as well with whatever quality and quantity of tea you want.<br /><br />  With all that said, I have found "Numi" to be a very good tea company as far as mass-produced sold in-store teas go.  They are definitely on the higher end of my list of good teas when you aren't in the mood for measuring your own.  I have used several of their loose leaf teas ( such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MSGMNE">Numi Flowering Tea Assortment - 9 Varieties</a> )and they are good quality, so I was excited, but apprehensive to try this tea.<br /><br />  This, is for bagged tea, I am happy to say, very very good.  It has a light fragrant taste, and is ideal for night time.  I know green tea at night time sounds like a bad idea, but green teas caffeine content isn't as high as black tea and isn't likely to keep you awake, even for someone like me who is highly caffeine sensitive.  Its just a very nice tea.  The first time I over steeped it quite a bit, but even then the taste was still smooth and the taste of tannins was not too strong, the second time was still slightly over steeped, but could barely taste the tannins at all, when steeped properly, there should be very little or not taste of tannins in this tea at all.<br /><br />  Overall, I was very impressed with this tea, the only reason I can't rate this tea higher is because of the price.  32 bags for [...] just isn't very cost-efficient.  That's equivalent to about 6-8pots of a normal sized tea pot.  I can buy about a 1/2 lb of good quality green tea for that price which will yield a lot more tea.  However, its still a great purchase for people who like bagged tea and I highly recommend it to those who do.  :)<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy<br /><br />  EDIT (11-19-09):  My husband reminded me that although the tea in these bags is great, the string on the bags has a tendency to come off when you try to take it out of the package, which is definitely a con, but does not change quality of the tea, just something to note when taking it out of the package.  :)

review/summary: A Pleasant Afternoon Pick-Me-Up
review/text: I am a great fan of greens and oolongs, particularly scented teas.<br /><br />This puerh brews deep reddish-brown liquor.  It is a full-bodied, smooth tea.  It has a light, not overbearing floral scent and a bold, but slightly sweet, fruity taste and a somewhat astringent finish.<br /><br />I do not taste the green except in the finish.  In fact, I wondered at first if there actually was green tea in the blend.  I was also interested in what is in the teabag, so I opened one to examine it.  There is indeed green tea in it.  The teabag does not contain tea dust.  It contains fannings, which are pieces of broken leaf.<br />I have added photos so you can see the liquor and the contents of the teabag.<br /><br />You can drink this pleasant tea unadorned if you wish.  It is a good afternoon offering and is suitable to serve with dessert.  It marries very well with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFAK6Y">Dare Cookies, Lemon Creme, 12.3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>.  You can steep this tea two or three times.  I brewed it at about 200 degrees Fahrenheit because green tea brews bitter in boiling water.  Brew it in simmering water.  I am pleasantly surprised and think this is worth trying, especially for those who want to try a new type of tea.

review/text: If you are looking for your run of the mill green tea this may not be for you. I actually drink this by itself but I also mix it with a chai tea that I love and it taste great. The tea color is brown not green and it is a different flavor. I would say it is closer to a weak black tea and it does not have the bitterness or the aftertaste you get with green tea. I really like it. I actually picked it up for $2 at tjmaxx (good place to buy tea...I'm for real) but it is worth $7 a box for sure.

review/text: I love this tea.  Though I usually prefer unflavored teas like green or honeybush (Numi's honeybush is also excellent, by the way), I've really fallen for this tea.  It's rich aroma and surprisingly dark color are instantly enticing.  It has a very smooth mouthfeel and a complexity and uniqueness of flavor (a bit like a lighter, less bitter coffee with a hint of barnyard and malt)that one does not often find in boxed teas.  I'd definitely recommend it for tea enthusiasts.<br /><br />Note: don't worry about the 3-5 minute brew time--this tea does not seem to become bitter regardless of steeping length.

review/text: If your tastebuds bore easily, try this tea. It really does change flavors, and dramatically. Unfortunately, I didn't find any of the wide range particularly outstanding. It starts with a fresh herbal taste, and as it cools it develops a green flavor that gives way to an earthiness and finally a bold and almost crispness that is fine over ice. Interesting, but not one I'd reach for regularly. If you are into sipping adventure, give it a try. If you are just looking for a 'nice tea'...others are better.

review/summary: A very palatable and easy to drink puerh
review/text: Puerh tea is one of my personal favorites but understandably a lot of casual tea drinkers are often turned off by the earthy-muddy taste that a true puerh produces.  Puerh's unique flavor comes from the process that used to create tea which involves a lengthy fermentation period.  It is this fermentation process that gives puerh additional benefits and is known in China as a 'dieter's' tea because of its diuretic properties.<br /><br />Numi Organic's Magnolia Puerh is a high quality tea utilizing only organic elements (the grean tea leaves, the puerh leaves as well as the magnolia) in this blend.  By combining green tea and magnolia Numi has created an easily drinkable puerh blend that first time and more casual drinkers can immediately latch onto.  My only caveat is that while being a delicious tea blend, the base flavor of puerh is significantly diminished (but its still there!  if you know what you're looking for) so puerh purists may not find the appeal here.  Still, this is a very tasty blend that makes puerh more accessible to just about anyone that enjoys a good cuppa.

review/text: As I poured boiling water over the tea bag a subtle scent of magnolia teased my nostrils. "Teased" is the operative word: the aroma stimulates the senses, but mostly vanishes when one actually begins to drink the tea; I can't say that I actually tasted it.  This tea is remarkably free of bitterness for a green tea, good for those who want both a pleasant and healthful experience, although I think the health benefits of green tea are overrated. Black tea generally has as high levels of antioxidants as green, cup for cup, but I suspect that the reason green tea is favored by some is that it is lower in caffeine; thus if caffeine gets in your way, you can drink more green tea than black and thus get more antioxidants into your system.<br /><br />Regarding the packaging, each teabag (I like the convenience versus loose tea) is enclosed in its own biodegradable packet and has a tiny slit to help the consumer open it easily. I think the box, which is rather close in size to roughly similar items on the grocery shelves (Celestial Seasonings, Bigelow teas, etc.), is a little large to contain only 16 tea bags.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like a green tea
review/text: I like this tea; but by no means does it drink like a typical green tea (say a jasmine). It has a dark tint and really tastes a lot closer to a black tea than a green.<br /><br />I love the smell and taste of Jasmine and had high hopes for the Magnolia Puerh however it had an "earthy" quality that was somewhat hard to get comfortable with. Not necessarily bad, but bordering on the fragrance of something like the stale smell of wet tree leaves in a pile. Nevertheless the quality of the tea leaves was very high and the packaging and wrapping were all top notch.<br /><br />Incidentally this is made with Pu'er leaves which were part of a huge speculative bubble in [...]

review/summary: For the adventurous tea drinker....
review/text: Numi teas have an enviable reputation in the American tea world:  they're known for being full-bodied and smooth, with good quality, clean leaves.  Numi's new organic Magnolia Puerh lives up to its promise.<br /><br />This blend of green and black tea has a light floral scent and a slightly sweet, fruity taste.  It has earthy pureh notes and an interesting burgundy color.<br /><br />For a lighter, less acrid taste, you may want to try making it with water that almost comes to a boil.<br /><br />This is a tea for the more adventurous tea drinker; the mix of darker earthy notes and sweet magnolia may not be for everyone, but it will certainly find its niche.

review/summary: Light, delicious
review/text: This is a lovely tea that is both full bodied and light at the same time. The tea is not bitter, and thus avoids a common problem I've encountered with Numi teas in the past. To test it, I underbrewed (less than 2 minutes) and overbrewed (7 minutes) the tea as well as steeping it for the recommended time of 3-5 minutes. Underbrewing, as expected, results in a weak tea barely recognizable as more than flavored hot water. Surprisingly, overbrewing, while resulting in a faint bitterness from the tannins in the tea, is not nearly as bitter as other teas when overbrewed. Optimal steeping provides a subtly floral, light, delicious tea that is highly enjoyable in the late afternoon -- perfect for a pick-me-up but not a jolt! Highly recommended.

review/summary: Very good, not too flowery
review/text: So often a flower influenced tea will have too much of the flowery flavor and scent in it but this one does not.  It's very good tea and even better if you bypass the bag by cutting it open and dumping the tea into your mug, steep and strain.  That paper tea bag no matter what it's made of keeps the full flavor of a good tea from being difused.

review/summary: Slightly bland
review/text: Let me start by saying I am a tea drinker rather than a coffe drinker so a good cup of tea every morning is very important to my well being...as well as those around me.  This morning, rather than my Harney and Sons loose leaf green, I used the Numi Organic Magnolia Puerh.  I realize that loose leaf is stronger and slightly tastier than bagged tea, but I am a Numi fan and was looking forward to their usually outstanding flavor.  This tea, however is pretty bland.  I had to add a speck of natural sugar to get a flavor from it.  Now, I haven't ever had Magnolia Puerh before, and this may be the type of flavor that comes from this type of tea, but I can't say I enjoyed a great cup of tea this morning.  The first thing I noticed was there wasn't any aroma.  No, ahhh moment when smelling the tea.  Then, upon first taste I didn't notice a flavor.  I decided to add a bit of sugar, but even then, not much.  A very faint smell of the Magnolia, but the flavor still pretty uneventful.  If you like a very soft tea, then this is for you, but if you like robust tea then skip this one.

review/text: I really liked the flavor of this tea.<br />It has a nice hint of floral that i can taste but not overpowering at all.<br />It was even ok cold as I got busy and could not finish it right away.<br />There are other reviews who give better comparison to other kinds they have had.<br />This was my first time trying this brand or kind. I usually drink store bought kinds like Lipton and Bigelow.<br />This is certainly a step up from them. On my Lipton i have to use two bags per cup for how i like it with this i could get it plenty strong for my taste from just the 2min steep time with one bag.<br />Yes i even tried it (gasp) with sugar and milk as that is what i grew up on and it really held the flavor well.<br />Sorry i am not more technical with my opinion but this is the best i can do to simply state i liked it.

review/summary: This is green tea?
review/text: After brewing a tea bag's worth of Numi Organic Tea Magnolia Puerh flavor, I am rather surprised that it is green tea (it says on the box "green tea blend" so maybe it's blended with black tea?). I usually drink a jasmine green tea and it's much more delicate than this. I'd compare the Numi to a black tea in its robustness. Also, I am not really sure what a magnolia blossom tastes like, but I didn't detect anything floral about this tea either in aroma or taste. There's a kind musky note to the flavor, but that's it. It's not a bad tea, but I don't think I'd choose it again.

review/summary: Magnolia Puerh
review/text: This tea, when you brew it and drink it without any sweetener, tastes just like the kind you get at sit-down Asian restaurants, and I mean that as a compliment.  Usually, I feel slighted if there's no honey to put in tea, but tea that tastes like this needs no embellishment.  As for a flowery description of just how it tastes, and the tea's aroma, please let me leave that for someone who knows how to describe beverages in those terms.  Just know that the Magnolia Puerh is delicious on its own, and also with just a little honey.<br /><br />The instructions on the package advise you to brew the tea for 2-4 minutes, no more, because if you brew longer, the tea can become bitter.  I took it one step past, boiling the water and letting it cool for a few minutes before I poured it over the tea, and then brewed the tea for about 3 minutes.  Perfect!<br /><br />The packaging of this tea makes it feel really special, and if you're so inclined, you could make yourself a little tea ritual by brewing it in an individual teapot and unplugging from the world for a little while.  Or you can elevate Chinese take-out to something more special by making some of this tea to go with it.  However, the teabags are also packaged for portability, in individual foil packets, so you can take teabags along to enjoy anywhere.

review/summary: A good soothing afternoon beverage...
review/text: I drink many different kinds of tea, including plain and flavored blacks, greens, and a wide variety of herbals. Green tea has never been my favorite, but I enjoyed it thoroughly in Numi's superb Magnolia Puerhl Green Tea Blend. This black and green mixed tea is medium-bodied, flavorful, and absolutely bitterless. The deep color of the brewed tea suggests a high proportion of black tea in the mixture, but I tasted the green tea as much as the black. With just a hint of magnolia - very similar in effect to jasmine - the overall flavor was extremely enjoyable. Perfect for afternoon teatime!

review/summary: Another winner from Numi
review/text: Drinking Numi tea is always a wonderful experience.  I find that taking the time to savor the fragrance of the Magnolia Puerh is  "centering."  This is a mild tea, that leaves a nice aftertaste.  I've been trying to chose green teas over black, but haven't found any green teas that I like as well as this one.  To be honest, while I definitely enjoyed this variety, my favorite remains the Numi Ginger Oolong.<br /><br />Even reading the box and recognizing the care that is taken with this product (and all the certifications that it has)  confirms it's not my imagination that drinking Numi is not the equivalent of having other teas...even the organic ones.  After having this green tea blend, it's going to be hard to use those other brands in my cupboard.

review/summary: Lacks flavor and aroma, but is certainly smooth
review/text: This tea disappointed me. I don't believe it has much flavor or aroma, and therefore it isn't pleasant to drink. Fortunately, as a result, it's a relatively smooth beverage and goes down easily.<br /><br />The instructions on the tea-bag wrapper (each tea bag is individually wrapped) stress not to steep this tea for more than 2-4 minutes. So just to be safe, I steeped the tea for 3 minutes in very hot water. The water developed a rich, dark brown color -- certainly unlike most green teas I've had in the past. This tea has a slight aroma, but I wouldn't call it floral: this tea is supposed to be scented with Magnolia flowers. In terms of flavor, despite the dark brown color, it is very weak and virtually flavorless. My first sampling was without sweeteners, but now that I know what the tea tastes like naturally, I'll be sure to use a sweetener to make it more interesting.<br /><br />The tea isn't bitter -- it's actually quite smooth. I just wish it had its own distinct flavor and aroma. As somebody who enjoys a cup of Earl Grey, this is definitely on the "weak" side.<br /><br />Fortunately, you can feel good about buying this product, because it's organic, and the packaging is made from recycled and biodegradable materials. Throw the teabag into your yard when you're done, and you complete the cycle intended by the manufacturer. I like the individual wrappings, allowing me to slip a few into a bag or put them into my desk drawer without worrying about them going stale. The packaging in general is awesome.<br /><br />If you like a smooth tea with very little flavor, this is probably a good choice. I don't think it tastes bad, I just don't think it's necessarily memorable. In other words, I won't find myself saying "I could really go for a cup of THAT tea".

It didn't taste like most green teas I've had but more like a good black tea while still having the health benefits of green tea. Other reviewers detected a "sweet floral" taste. My tastebuds must not be that refined because I didn't detect that. To me it was a nice earthy strong tea. Just make sure you don't over steep it like the directions indicate.

review/summary: Subtle and Enjoyable
review/text: I've tried both the Numi "Chocolate Puerh" and "Magnolia Puerh" teas.  Both are excellent quality.  The flavors are distinct, not overpowering, and enjoyable.<br /><br />These teas are enjoyable with just a touch of agave to sweeten the cup.  The flavor is pleasant without any need to be enhanced or covered up by anything else.  A touch of lemon juice also works well.  And a dash of vitamin C can be used in harmony with this tea.<br /><br />I do agree with the instructions to not let it steep too long, in fact a good full flavor is obtained at the low end of their recommended steeping times.<br /><br />I like what they have written on the box about being high quality and healthy.  It is nice to not find "artificial flavors" added.  This company appears to really care about producing a good product and protecting the environment.

review/summary: Fruity and delicate
review/text: When I first put the tea bag into the hot water, I was rewarded with a burst of floral scent.  Unfortunately, it faded away rather rapidly, which was a disappointment.  I love fragrant teas.<br /><br />This is a very nice tea.  The flavor is fruity, a bit on the mango side.  It has a nice delicate complexity that develops as it cools down in the cup.  The directions say to steep for 2 - 4 minutes, and cautions against over-steeping and resultant bitterness.  I steeped it for two minutes initially to avoid any threat of bitterness.  The directions also say to pour boiling water over the tea bag, which I thought was strange.  I was taught to never use boiling hot water with green tea, so I am a bit puzzled about that.<br /><br />I steeped the tea bag in 8 oz. of water.  If it is steeped only two minutes, there might be enough flavor left for another cup of tea - whether it is suitable for re-steeping will probably be a matter of personal preference.  If the yield is only one cup, however, that puts this tea on the pricey side.<br /><br />This tea is described as a "Magnolia scented green tea and black Puerh blend."  Quite frankly, I can't detect much black puerh taste to it.  Good quality black puerh on its own is robust with complex earthy flavors.  Despite not quite aligning with my expectations for a puerh tea, I like it.  It has a fruity complexity of flavor that is not at all unpleasing.

review/summary: Fragrant but Palate Cleansing
review/text: I am more of a black tea drinker but Numi's Magnolia Green Puerh Tea sounded delicious. I was not disappointed. There is no need for sweeteners since the tea is very palatable on its own. There is little to no after taste unlike many green teas I've tried. The fragrance of the magnolias is confined to scent. You can't taste herbs in it. It is also a great tea to drink with a meal as it is a palate cleanser. I found that out quite by accident when I tried it alongside a rather pungent cheese. Excellent tea and I will be purchasing this again. It is well worth the money.<br /><br />Be sure to follow the steeping instructions. Only leave the bag in for 2-4 minutes and don't squeeze the bag. That will release the bitterness of the tea and detract from the natural qualities. It is perfect right at about 3 minutes when the tea is a medium golden brown.

review/summary: This tea is the best!
review/text: I need to say first that I'm a big fan of Numi brand tea.  Yes, it's more expensive than other teas, but I find the price is more than deserving for the quality.<br /><br />This particular variety has a wonderful flavor.  It contains the earthy, rich flavor of the puerh, with the floral (almost sweet) flower of the magnolia.  The red magnolia and brown puerh gives the tea a deep burgundy color, which is really quite nice.  Puerh by itself can be a bit strong, but combined with the herbal magnolia makes the flavor just right.  I don't usually put milk in my tea, but it went really nicely with numi puerh tea.  I also appreciate that it's organic and contains no pesticides.<br /><br />This tea may seem a little expensive, but all in all I think it's a very reasonable price.  You're getting 32 tea bags for $14, or 43 cents each.  That's not all that bad.  Whenever I make tea, I make a whole pot and use two tea bags, which ends up being about 4 cups.  All in all, I highly recommend this tea and will be enjoying each cup I brew.

review/summary: Excellent Blend
review/text: This Magnolia Puerh and green tea blend is surprisingly smooth and easy to brew. I've brewed it as a green tea and as a black and it is delicious both ways. Brewing it as a black tea brings out deeper and richer (yet still smooth) tones. Brewing it as a green highlights the florals. I appreciate that the flavor oils (magnolia) are not too strong as other flavored teas I have tried. No strange oil slick at the top of your cup, and not oily residue in the teapot. The floral is there, but it doesn't overpower. This is a well made tea.<br /><br />I use a Zarafina machine to brew all my tea and have found that one Magnolia Puerh tea bag is good for 3-4 cups of tea. This is a delightful tea blend and I will buy again.<br /><br />Is this review helpful? Please let me know. Vote. :-)

review/summary: Beautiful Magnolia, but not a fan of Pu-Erh
review/text: I love all kinds of tea, and Pu-Erh is about the only kind I've not yet tried, so I was excited to try this version from Numi.  I enjoy many of Numi's teas- the Genmai Cha and Rose White are two of my favorites.  When I first opened this teabag, I was struck by the beautiful magnolia smell.  I've never had a magnolia tea before, and it's a beautiful scent.  There were slight hints of the earthier pu-erh underneath, but in the dry bag, the most overwhelming note is magnolia.  After brewing up a cup for the recommended 2-4 minutes I sat down to drink.  At first, it was difficult to discern exactly what I was tasting.  I could no longer smell the magnolia notes that I could discern in the dry bag.  When I tasted the tea I finally got a sense of the pu-erh flavor- deep and earthy.  I know that pu-erh is a love or hate thing, and this is basically when I discovered that I do not love pu-erh.  I find that it tastes a bit rotten.  The magnolia masked it a bit, but really, if you're not a fan of pu-erh, don't bother, because it's still pu-erh.  I now know that I am not a pu-erh drinker.  If Numi ever makes a magnolia green tea, however, I will certainly buy a case.  The positive I took away from this was that I really like magnolia scenting.

This is definitely not the case with the Numi Organic Tea Magnolia Puerh. It was wonderful! I'm normally a fan of green teas. This is a mix of green and black teas. I was surprised that the black tea did not overpower the flavor. It was an excellent blend. The directs say to use boiling water. I found that using boiling water brought out some of the black tea bitterness so I used water just below boiling. The aroma was beautiful. My neighbor stopped by and asked for a cup after smelling my cup. You can't go wrong with this tea purchase.

They were sale priced then and a few bags of these for the bridge table was quite reasonable. After the introductory period, the prices wet up to  four to six dollars a bag, depending upon the store I was in.<br />I looked for them on Amazon from time to time, but did not spot them until Christmas. I ordered a four pack and was delighted when they arrived just in time for the holiday hustle and bustle. They made a great thank you for the UPS man, mailman etc along with a little cash. Chocolate always enhances the deal! They are great stocking stuffers and wonderful for last minute thank you presents. I had to order more to fulfill my needs. I HAVE to have a stash of my own for times when nothing but chocolate will do!<br />I read other reviewers and see that they must have found these before I did and apparently ordered when it was still hot. Their chocolate melted. I do not know how Amazon generally handles perishables in the summer. The first time I ordered these, they were not on Prime. Now they are. I do not know if that will effect shipping. But, for the present, I would say, order your stash while it is cold.<br />If it is summer, call Amazon to see if they will handle this as a perishable.<br />As a chocolate, it it the usual great tasting Hershy's with a coating on it. The outside coating is not sugar like M and M's, and it will melt. But it makes for easy handling in eating. It is not soft like the usual candy bar. It will melt in your hand, but not readily. You are able to hold a hand full through a conversation and they will not melt.  I introduced them to my Bridge buddies and now see them served at Bunco, Yahtzee and other get togethers. They are popular and I love them. From me, they get 5 stars!

review/summary: My new favorite
review/text: Growing up I have always been a huge fan of chocolates. Hershey chocolate has always been one of my favorite. When this product was first introduced I thought it was a pretty neat concept that I can have a pouch of hershey chocolate with me anywhere, well that was the idea until I bought one. Let me warn you guys before hand because these little bastards are addictive. The other night I bought a pack from CVS since they go on sale for about 3 dollars a pouch, which is a great deal. I opened the pouch and started eating little by little while I was watching Breaking Bad on netflix. Next thing you know, halfway through one episode I finished the whole bag. It was really a sad and horrific moment at the same time. Sad because I finished it within 20 minutes but horrific because these bad boys are really high on the calorie count. For about every 15 pieces, it measures up to 200 calories. Considering I ate the whole bag, I probably racked up to 600-700 calories within 20 minutes, but then again that is my fault because I have no self control. The taste is great, and really easy to chew on. They are very smooth and melts in your mouth. Overall, this is an amazing snack but very unhealthy for someone like me who has no self control over chocolate.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review! Hopefully I helped and if you have any questions or comments please let me know.

review/text: These things catch of lot of whiteflies, but they also catch other insects, such as juvenile praying mantises. And, although it makes me feel good to see hundreds of dead whiteflies stuck on the trap, there are still lots left eating the vegetables. So you will still have to use chemical controls, like insecticidal soap, to reduce the population of bad insects.

review/summary: Very good; similar to what we had in Dominican
review/text: We had "Chinola" while in the Dominican Republic and loved it. Found this on Amazon and it is very very similar, though not quite as sweet. Had some issues getting it correctly from The Latin Products, since they sent Jam instead of Juice for some reason, then I had to prove to them by taking pics that they had sent the wrong thing. But they did correct it and let me keep the Jam as well (which is excellent too). Very good product; not cheap, but when you are desperate for Chinola, its worth it. And yes, I do now know the difference between sh*t and chinola! (if you have heard that old saying before).

review/summary: Improve your Circulation with a Top Vascular Fitness Drink!
review/text: This virtually unprocessed cacao powder from Equador is a top quality low calorie food with an extremely high antioxidant concentration (especially the polyphenol epicatchin). You can make a delicious hot drink of it with Soymilk and only 4 grams of powder. It will result in an immediate increased blood flow through your body from brain to feet and lowering of your blood pressure for a couple of hours.<br />For me as a diabetic with a clear vascular dysfunction it is especially beneficial by eliminating this defect through an acute increase of the powerful natural blood vessel dilator Nitric Oxide (NO). Most cacao powders are far more processed ( e.g. at high temperatures) destroying  the vast majority of the healthy cacao polyphenols.<br />Many recent research articles in prestigious medical journals have confirmed these important benefits for cardiovascular health. At present there are very few unprocessed cacao powders on the market.<br />In short if you wish to improve your vascular fitness, try out this one!<br />As a public health physician I can assure you, you will not be dissappointed.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I wish I could send this back, but I take the blame and call it a life lesson...try a smaller amount first! Seems so obvious now.  If i were reading this, I'd think I was dumb too, who orders 2.5lbs of a product (normally used in small quantities) without tasting it first? I know, I know.  I'm an idiot.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />I know this is raw, and I'm not calling the Sunfood folks liars, I'm sure it is, and I've bought and liked a number of their other branded products (from their website), but: this has a very bitter taste to it that sort of leaves the overall impression of burntness/ashiness as the flavor.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty intensely cacao-y, but it's also flat and harsh at the same time.<br /><br />And no, I'm not confusing raw cacao powder with cocoa or sweetened cacao or any other thing.  I've tried 5 other brands of raw cacao powder and liked them all, to varying degrees (8-10 on a love scale).  We were going through about 8-12oz a week in our green smoothies so I thought I'd go with this to try and save some money, and since I'd liked every other brand we'd tried, I didn't think anything of buying a huge quantity of a brand I hadn't tried. Now I know better!! I'd put this closer to a 3-4 on a scale of 1-10.  It's OK to use in very small quantities to impart a vaguely chocolatey flavor (like a teaspoon in pancake batter), but other than that, the bitter ashiness really rears its head.<br /><br />I'm so irritated with myself for buying this without trying it, that at this point we're basically just not having smoothies (and my morning banana-cacao smoothie was something to look forward to!)<br /><br />My guess is that in a month or so, we'll finally admit to ourselves that we threw money away, suck it up and just chuck it all.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that the Sunfood brand raw cacao powder is fattier and (therefore) more caloric than other brands.  I don't know if that has something to do with the flavor profile (doubtful though because raw cacao butter, which is the extracted fat, is neither bitter nor ashy).<br /><br />SO disappointed.

review/summary: Black Tea with Lemon
review/text: This tea really tastes good.  I love tea, and so I know bad tea when I drink it.  And believe me, this tea is good.<br /><br />The can says it is from Kenya.  It also states that it is fair world trade, or something like that, so that the farmers there get fair pay, better health care, and education.  That was good news!<br /><br />And another reason this tea is good, is because, even though it doesn't say "vegan", after reading the ingredients, it is vegan-friendly.<br /><br />So there's lots of good reasons for me to continue buying and drinking this product:<br /><br />1 - I love tea, and I love lemon, and this tea really tastes perfect.<br /><br />2 - It is fair world trade.<br /><br />3 - It is vegan-friendly.<br /><br />4 - The price is fair.<br /><br />Thanks to the tea growers in Kenya, and the manufacturers of this product.  I love this tea.

review/text: I just recently started ordering Steaz teas through Amazon. So far I have ordered 8 cases. I love the convenience of having great tasting iced tea in a can. At home I still make my own iced tea but the taste of Steaz is very fresh. The sweetened teas have 20 grams of sugar per can so I alternate between sweetened and unsweetened. Sometimes the case arrives torn but the cans are never dented so I don't mind.

This is the best ancho I've used for my grilling rubs. Works equally well with the rub blends I've whipped up for meats and those for veggies. So far all the chile products I've gotten from Angelina's have been fresh and produce the depth of flavor I hoped for.

review/summary: Uniformly Excellent
review/text: Don't have a clue what the negative reviews are about...it's a food product and there will always be natural variations in consistency. I haven't experienced any with this product. Even though I received a 1kg bag with a broken seal, it was still excellent (it's a sin to waste it, LOL!). [...]. As far as the "light" color goes, oily black beans clog super-auto machine's grinders so they're usually not recommended. FWIW, the Illy (see below) is black as night and it's pre-ground so I don't have to worry about clogging as I can manually bypass dose the machine. You can do the same with any espresso you buy pre-ground or grind in an external grinder.<br /><br />Personally, I love the stuff! I was introduced to it by friends who bought a Saeco Incanto Sirius super-auto (HIGHLY Recommended) and use Super Crema and Illy Decaf pre-ground (fantastic, but you need a mortgage to buy the stuff) and I loved them so much I bought my own Sirius and tons of Lavazza (as well as the Illy decaf). I've had the Saeco from Memorial Day to Labor Day this summer and have brewed circa 800(!) shots, going through SIX (6) kilos (13.5#) of Super Crema in the process and have yet to brew a bad shot. It does fine in cappucino and cafe crema as well. I bring 12 shots into work on fridays (bagel day) and everyone loves the stuff...I haven't met one person who didn't enjoy my Super Crema espresso and that's served from a thermos!<br /><br />Buy a bag and see for yourself....for LESS THAN the price of Starbucks garbage, you can get the real deal here. I just bought six more bags of the stuff...I'm keeping most of it and giving one or two away as gifts to family/friends. Remember the old caveat: there truly is no accounting for taste, LOL!<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />UPDATE (4/8/09): After approx. 4,000+ shots, I haven't changed my opinion. If anything, I love this stuff even more now! I am completely addicted to Super Crema to the point that I can't stomach anything else. I still haven't had a bad shot with the stuff. If you find better, let me know, please! You'll have to go some to beat Super Crema in my book, especially at the under $[...]/lb. price point!

review/text: Lavazza produces the best espresso beans according to me. Someone was complaining against the quality - may be the packs that you bought were too old and yes- generally espresso does upset sensitive stomach, that does not indicate bad quality of coffee beans. I am from Europe and can say that Starbucks coffee is not to my taste, I have to agree with Mr.Hernandes. The bitter taste that they achieve has blends and notes of something quite different than the normal espresso bitterness.

review/text: If you have a super automatic (like my Saeco Incanto Sirius), and like an excellent Italian espresso or coffee crema, this is it!  The beans are traditional European espresso roast. American espresso beans look like they have been dipped in black oil.  The color of European espresso is more brown in nature, without the oily residue on the beans--thus no "gunk" to plug up your super automatic.<br /><br />The flavor is amazing.  It is a balanced coffee, with notes of floral and spice.<br /><br />I was hesitant to spend $25 on a kilo of coffee at first; this is now my regular!

review/summary: Something is terribly wrong!
review/text: This was one of the worst tasting coffee's I have ever tried. Something must be wrong with the batch, mis packed or everyone else who reviewed this is nuts.<br /><br />I have to assume there was some kind of problem with the beans. It was bland and lacked flavor. The beans looked nothing like any espresso beans I have ever seen. No real crema, yuck.<br /><br />Sending them back, why suffer?

review/summary: Lavazza is a poor choice
review/text: This is about the worst expresso coffee i have tried.Was looking to see a dark Italian roasted coffee but it is not a true dark roast. The color is brown-tan and does not even taste like an expresso. I use a Gaggia Baby machine for many years and have tried many different coffees including other Lavazzas but this is a poor excuse for an Italian type expresso. Starbucks is better, and that is a stretch.<br /><br />AL.

review/summary: Dankest Teriyaki slabbed strips on the market
review/text: These strips are delicious. I just bought my second pack and received in in about 4 or 5 business days(ordered it on saturday and got it on wednesday).takes longer to ship it here than it does for me to eat it. Stuff is almost too good. I'm glad it goods for you though, makes me feel better about eating 5 strips in an hour. It's much easier to chew if you cut it up into smaller strips and put that in a bag or something. The only thing i wish was different about this product is that i would like to see a zipper on the packaging, but from the looks of things, this product seems to have been put through a food-saver. Awesome all around. I will never be ripped off at a gas station for their bs jerky again.

review/summary: Great, great!
review/text: I never knew such a thing was called "western cut".  I had discovered this product when it was sold at the Texas Renaissance Festival near Houston in 2004.  The original supplier has since gone out of business, but Buffalo Bill's is a very close substitute.<br /><br />The hotness won't blow your head off, and the sweet adds a nice contretemps, but this is a very . . . "very noice" . . . jerky.<br /><br />The product I had grown used to was a little drier and a little hotter, but Buffalo Bill provides a fine, fine jerky.  I like the idea of pulling out a giant slab of jerky, and getting 8 or 10 good-size "chaws" from it. My only regret is that a 1.4 LB bag is gone so quickly.<br /><br />You can expect a razor-thin sheet of jerky that is easy to tear, or bite, into portions.  Occasionally, you will encounter the "hidden treasure" of a chunk of fat that melts in your mouth. Crushed red pepper abounds, but it'll fall off by the time this jerky reaches your maw.  What you are left with is a jerky you can tuck into your cheeks like a squirrel and enjoy for an hour, or a jerky you will be compelled to chew and swallow as quickly as possible so that you might get to the next bite.<br /><br />If you like a smooth, slightly-hot, imminently chewable slice of jerky, I encourage you to try this product.

review/summary: Meh
review/text: I'm a big jerky fan and saw the reviews for this Western Cut (which I've never tried before).  This is NOT what I expected.  I have to rip jagged pieces off the paper thin flat sheet of jerky and I can barely taste the spices considering this is supposed to be Cajun.  Essentially I'm finding that this product for me is just "something to chew".  I also ordered Buffalo Bill's Hot Short Shots which I am enjoying quite a bit more (although once again I would not consider them to be hot).  I will consider trying other Buffalo Bill's products based on the Short Shots but I am very disappointed with the Western Cut Jerky.  So much for trying new things...

review/text: Very good jerky.. Would be 5 star, if not so expensive. Really the best I've tasted by far, and I've tried about 60+ different jerkys. But I could by one from here in CA. that is cheaper and has more in it. And the taste is not too far from yours.. I'm going to be looking for that jerky company that every bag I buy they give one to the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Being stuck in those hell holes, a bag of jerky was a real moral booster. Really basically any thing from home was.. So really a good jerky if you got the money...

review/summary: New favorite beef jerky!
review/text: Recently I really wanted some good beef jerky and happened to find this on Amazon.  I decided to try it out and am really glad I did.  This seller shipped quickly and even included a bonus sample; I can't wait to order from them again. The jerky is  sliced really thin and packed with flavor.  Another reviewer wrote "You can chew off a piece and savor the flavor for quite a awhile and is a welcomed difference to the norm," and I couldn't describe it better. The rest of my family loved it as well!!  I can't wait to try out some of their other flavors and products.

review/summary: Found it after years of hunting!  YAY! Placed 2nd order today~
review/text: You have not had beef jerky until you have found a thin cut red pepper like Buffalo Bill has made. I have been only finding this stuff randomly on road trips and debating long days in the car to get one or two pieces again. Instead! I have found you online you bite worthy spicy sometimes awesomely fatty and delightful jerky! I have fallen for you in high school before class when I had nerds asking me too many questions about homework. I would turn and breathe fire breath at them and today is so wonderful that I am placing another order for more! I can't stand waiting...I just ate the last piece and I hate that I can't sit still that long wanting more. Do you distribute in Los Angeles? How can one find some locally? It's that good guys, please order it yesterday you will pissed off only because there is no more left. Arrives on time, as advertised, hell better than advertised, I am so into the cajun flavor you have worked out Buffalo Bill you So make the grade with me &lt;3  Mhmm my mouth is a little hot and tingly just like I remember it being so good!  You helped me restore awesome childhood memories via senses, I recommend this with all of my Western Galness.  I grew up going on trips up and down the coast where lots of jerky is sold at Farmers Markets from happy cows in Cali.  This takes the cake!!!!

review/summary: Good but could be better.
review/text: Overall this brand is good but I think it is lacking in "spicyness" as they don't seem spicy at all. I don't , not like them but I just wish they had more "sweet spicy" flavor instead of more sweet. The package I got was a bit old I think as it was a bit dry but not inedible. Don't get me wrong, I love jerky but these could be better and maybe fresher. My only real complaint other than it's dryness is it just isn't spicy enough to be called spicy. I love peppered/spicy jerky and this really doesn't fully cut the mustard.

Pleased to find a real traditional jerky with generous amount of cracked black pepper. Not your wimpy soft & moist & chewy style, this jerky is on the dry side, thin cut, and needs to be savored in small bites. Only complaint is that there is a lot of jerky in this bag - a ziplock would have been a nice addition. Will be ordering more of this.

review/summary: Don't.  Waste.  Your.  Money.
review/text: OK, so I eat a lot of jerky--some of it slab, some of it not--and this was simply inedible.  Not even only from a human perspective; my dog wouldn't eat it.  Literally, she spit it back out (PETA peeps: yes, I feed my dog human food and no, I don't care if you think it's wrong).<br /><br />Back to the jerky.  It's nearly impossible to rip a piece off, let alone actually chew it.  Also......Cajun?  Seriously?  Not only did it not have a Cajun kick, it had absolutely no flavor at all.<br /><br />As for slab jerky, go for Tillamook Country Smoker brand.  I read a review somewhere about the TCS jerky that mentioned that it's sold in gas stations, and yes it is.  But it's very tender, and when you get one of their flavors (I've tried them all), they actually taste like what they are.<br /><br />Finally, in an effort to show that I'm not an affiliate of some other brand just criticizing the BB slab jerky, Buffalo Bill's honey pepper jerky ranks up there with some of the best I've ever had.  Don't buy this slab stuff, buy that...

review/text: Super thin and also hard and fibrous. It was in large sheets that you couldn't  snack on. Didn't taste the teriyaki. Had a old beef taste. Threw it away. Maybe making it from one muscle is not the way to go? Needed a sharp knife really... Thought it was historically accurate to what the Indians had. Maybe that's what "Western Cut" means?

Great flavor, has a little heat, but nothing unbearable (at least to me).  The carbohydrate content isn't too high, so it works well for other low-carbers like myself.  A nice portable protein source.

review/summary: Best jerky on Amazon. Period
review/text: Buffalo Bills western cut big slab beef jerky is flat out the best beef jerky on Amazon, hands down. The sweet and spicy listed here is tangy and tasty and it's almost impossible to eat just one. Try all the flavors, you won't be disappointed. I've had every kind of jerky from all kinds of different producers, and Buffalo Bills Western Cut Big Slab is the best by far. I give it as gifts for Xmas and birthdays, its really that good.<br />The only problem you are likely to have with it is storage. Usually I eat the entire bag within a day or two, so storage isn't that much of an issue, but your mileage may differ. I either use a large zip lock bag, or re-use one of the round plastic containers from Buffalo Bills regular cut jerky. If you re-use a round container, you will need a sharp pair of scissors to cut the western cut big slabs to make them fit in the round container.<br />Bottom line on this one is; Buy it, you will only regret that you took so long to find it.
