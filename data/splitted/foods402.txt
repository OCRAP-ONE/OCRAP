review/summary: Best ever bottled drink
review/text: I have been buying this drink for a couple of years and the Cranberry Lemonade flavor use to be available in my grocery store.  For some reason, they no longer sell this flavor in Chicago! Since I could no longer find it, I have been ordering 4 cases at a time from Amazon.  On the first couple of orders the shipping was free.  Since then, however, they are charging for shipping as it comes from a second party distributor.  The shipping costs are outrageous!! If Amazon could figure out a way to lower these costs considerably, I would purchase more than I am currently ordering.  It is the best organic, slightly sweetened thirst quencher I have ever tasted! I cannot, however, justify spending $$$ to have it shipped to my home. The cost per 16.9 oz bottle totals almost $4.00 and that's just too much.

review/summary: Wow!! What a difference in 2 weeks & my kitties love it!
review/text: I have two senior, indoor cats. Before I introduced Wellness into their diet they were both vomiting almost every day for a month. My vet ran tests but found nothing remarkable. The next step would have been x-rays. I was perplexed and worried about my little ones. Although I did not order this food as a "cure," my newfound awareness of my cats' sensitive digestive systems and what was going into their food drove me to seek another alternative to the Iams Indoor Weight and Hairball Control catfood I was feeding them. They were also hacking up constant fur balls despite the special catfood and daily brushing.<br /><br />My cats have not vomited once in the 2 weeks since I switched them to this catfood! They seem to have more energy too. As if that weren't enough, I have not seen one hairball. Their coats are gorgeous, thicker, shinier and those dry flakes are gone. They are shedding less - when I go to brush them there is less fur in the comb. These are the results after only 2 weeks! I am very impressed with these Wellness products and I am picky about what I give to my furry children. Of course my vet continues to push the Science diet (which my cats hate) and Eukanuba, telling me about the "tests and trials" these brands have run that no other brands have, but I believe nature equipped my cats with good instincts about what they should and should not eat. They love this food and it appears to love them back. I feel good about the ingredients. I will continue to give it to my babies along with the Wellness Healthy Weight Formula and the Wellness canned catfood.

review/summary: Life saving
review/text: I had a 4 pound starving, adult feral cat arrive in my house a year ago. Her fur was falling out, her bones showed and she was diagnosed with FLUTD. After feeding her this food for the last year she is free of FLUTD, has the softest fur I have ever felt on an animal, save a chinchilla, and has maintained her weight at a healthy 9 pounds in spite of being an indoor cat.<br /><br />This food is well balanced, made from excellent ingredients and puts to use the latest in nutritional information about cats.<br /><br />Highly recommended<br /><br />Regarding frugalone "PJ"'s review: "No one knows for sure why some cats get FLUTD and others don't. Many potential causes have been hypothesized, including viruses, abnormal urinary retention, obesity, bladder defects, and-the most popular theory to date is improper diet. In reality, one or all of these factors might play a role in the occurrence of FLUTD."<br />--maxshouse.com<br /><br />(I have no affiliation with maxshouse.com)

review/text: I read the great hype about this cat food.  It sounded like the best thing I could give my cat.  Unfortunately, I didn't even finish a complete 4 lb bag when my cat got blocked and he had to be rushed to the clinic.  So even though they say it is for their urinary tract health with proper pH to prevent struvite crystals, don't believe it.  (I would have rated this food zero but the system made me rate it at least one star.)

review/summary: Stone Soup
review/text: The Sun Bird Sweet and Sour mix packet I purchased had a recipe for sweet and sour pork on the back. I liked the idea. I also liked the relatively low sodium level for a mix. The instructions were printed in extremely small type, and I had no idea what I was getting into when I purchased the rest of the ingredients--pork, an onion, a green pepper and two carrots. I saw soy sauce, canned pineapple, catsup, cornstarch and sugar mentioned, but I always have those things on hand.<br /><br />By the time dinner was ready, I'd spend twenty minutes slicing, peeling and chopping, and had dirtied three bowls, two whisks, two measuring cups, a slotted spoon, a wooden spoon, a pair of tongs and my wok. I'd also used a LOT of cornstarch and another twenty minutes mixing the pork marinade (which called for 2 T of soy sauce, upping the sodium content considerably), mixing the sweet and sour sauce, marinating the pork, trying to brown the wet pork, removing the pork, adding the vegetables, adding the sauce back along with the pineapple, stirring frantically while the sauce was reducing and trying to judge when the sauce was thick enough. I was exhausted, the sink was full of dirty bowls and utensils and the kitchen was HOT.<br /><br />The chopping and the dirty wok go with the territory of Oriental cooking and I expected them, and I knew I'd have to make a pot of rice, but I certainly didn't expect to have to work so hard nor provide so many of the sauce ingredients to make dinner from a mix.  I wouldn't complain if the results had been spectacular, but they weren't.  Dinner was just OK. The finshed dish was bland and I added some red pepper flakes to perk it up. I must say I was disappointed both in the method and in the results. I've made sweet and sour pork from scratch before; it was only a little more work than this sauce packet recipe and the flavor was a lot better.<br /><br />It wasn't terrible, hence the two stars, but certainly not worth the time and effort.  I'll stir fry with orange juice and soy sauce before I'll use this mix again.  And in future, I'm going to read the back of packets much more carefully!

review/summary: OMH dog biscuits
review/text: I agree with another review in that too many biscuits are broken when they arrive at my house. BTW I had the same problem buying them directly at the store.<br /><br />I have fed my dogs these biscuits for about 25 years. The dogs love these biscuits but the real reason I feed them is because they are the hardest biscuits I have been able to find. The dogs take a long time to eat them and have to do a lot of chewing. This cleans their teeth. Since I started feeding these biscuits not one vet has suggested that my dog's teeth needed cleaning. I've probably had 5 or 6 dogs in that time and 5 or 6 vets too. I figure what I've saved in cleanings has more than paid for the biscuits plus the dogs like the biscuits.<br /><br />One thing worth noting is that my dog's diet is more than half dry food; I don't know if a dog on a wet food diet would have the same success.

review/summary: Great Dog Treats
review/text: These dog treats are great.  Our dog loves them!  They're on the smaller size as far as dog biscuits go - shaped like peanuts in the shell (and are a little larger than the actual size of a peanut).  We particularly like them because they fit perfectly into a medium sized Kong toy - and because they are shaped like a peanut - you can shove them so they get kind of stuck in the Kong and it takes the dog a while to get it out.

review/text: Not too long ago, I tried Chimes Ginger Chews and I loved them. I found them at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and, at the time I noticed there were two varieties available. I bought the "original" flavor. However, now in coming back I picked up a second packet (1.5 ounces) 0f Mango Chewy Ginger Candy. It's good. Real good. Wonderfully chewy. It has a strong ginger flavor, plus a strong after-taste of mango. Very unusual candy, and quite delicious. The chews come individually wrapped. Best of luck for getting them out of their wrappers. Believe me, you'll understand what I mean. It's well worth the trouble, however..<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: So I jumped right in and read the reviews. Half good...half bad. These crackers are by far the worst tasting low carb crisps I have tried and the most expensive. maybe it was me? I gave one crisp to 3 other people and they all spit them out. They concur...gross. Grainy texture and dries your mouth out immediately after putting in mouth. Smells nasty. Guess what their return policy is?? No problem as long as you return the package in an "unused and resaleable" condition. Now how do you do that when you first try them? What a joke. Not even an offer of % off next purchase or exchange or anything other than your S.O.L.!! Buyer beware here for sure. Amazon should resist having sellers with this kind of return policy on products.

Only reason that I didn't give them a 5-star is the shipping costs make them an expensive treat.  If I can find them locally, I will buy them on a regular basis. If I can't, they will be an occasional treat.

review/summary: Another delicious ginger ale from Bruce Cost
review/text: I'm a big fan of all natural gourmet sodas and have found a new favorite in Bruce Cost ginger ales. They are locally produced (New York City) and fantastically delicious. They are pretty hard to find too. I've only seen them at my Hong Kong Supermarket in Chinatown and they cost $2 a bottle.<br /><br />I like the unfiltered versions. Reminds me of Japanese <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007WXLHSC">nigori sake</a>, with all the cloudy particles that settle to the bottom. The jasmine flavor is very apparent in this tea and so is the ginger. It's got a real kick that lasts for several minutes after drinking. The drink is carbonated just right. Not too fizzy and not too light. It's very sweet, so caloric content is somewhat high at 160 calories per bottle (same as a can of soda). Cap is twist off (wrap your shirt around the top before twisting to make it easier).<br /><br />So far, I've also tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RTOWE0">Bruce Cost Fresh Ginger Ale Pomegranate Hibiscus</a>. I like this product, but like the pomegranate hibiscus more. If you can find this, have one! You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Very Strange Snack
review/text: I've dipped into my new bag of Chocolate Pirate Booty (eww?) twice, and although my experience has been consistent, it makes for a difficult review.<br /><br />First, the appearance: I won't bring this into work. I'm a brave person who does zany and odd-looking things at work, but the resemblance of this snack to poop cannot be overstated. I just can't bring myself to indulge in this snack in public. Can't do it.<br /><br />Then the texture: this is very, very similar to the cheese and veggie pirate booty snacks. The crunch is the same, less powder gets onto your hands, and it seems to have a bit more oil in it. No complaints about the texture.<br /><br />Now the taste: Um. The first one always tastes burnt and yucky. Then I try a second and a third, the chocolate powder flavor kicks in and identifies itself as chocolate instead of burnt stuff, and I find myself addicted and reaching for the next chocolate doodle without knowing whether or not I actually *like* the flavor. It seems the more I eat it, the more I like it. It's a strange, strange substance and I'm glad I tried it, but I won't know until I'm finished with the bag whether I'll purchase it again or not. It's likely I'll take it in to game night as a gag sometime so we can all have a laugh about poop doodles. (poodles?)<br /><br />I recommend trying it just because it's so incredibly unique, but if you find the appearance off-putting and the flavor incomprehensible, you heard it here first.

review/summary: Great Color But Little Taste
review/text: Some of us can curl our tongue while others can't. Some can cross their eyes while others can't. The list of some can while others can't goes on and on. Why am I bringing this up? Simple: I get almost no taste from this tea. I note the glowing five star reviews from so many others (which led me to buy this tea) which I interpret to mean that they can taste some element here which I can't.<br /><br />I will give this product kudos for being the best looking tea I can ever remember seeing. It's a gorgeous dark red color so is aesthetically pleasing at least to the eyes. However, to my taste, the tea has a weaker flavor than even the mildest green teas. It isn't a patch, flavor-wise, on this company's excellent Yorkshire Tea or Twining's Irish Breakfast -for two examples.<br /><br />My recommendation is for anybody unfamiliar with this tea is to order the smallest amount possible. You may be in the group which finds this tea to be wonderful (the majority here) or you may be like me and find it almost tasteless. In case you are like me, being stuck with 20 or so servings is bad enough. Being stuck with something like 100 or more would be vexing to say the least.

review/text: I purchased this to send to my daughter at university as a pick me up.  We had visited a tourist town during the summer where they made their own taffy and sold it.  She really had a good time there.  When she was having a rough finals week I got on line and found this to send to her.  She loved it!!! She said it was so good.  I told her to share with her room mates and her sister who is there also.  She had a hard time doing that because she said it was so good she wanted it all for herself.  I am thinking of sending her more for next finals week =)

review/summary: Decent Salt Water Taffy
review/text: This isn't the best salt water taffy I've ever tasted but it wasn't the worst. The consistency was good. I thought it could be a little more softer and chewier. I thought the flavors stood out meaning you can easily tell what flavor you are eating. Some brands of salt water taffy it's hard to distinguish flavors and end up all tasting somewhat the same even though they have different colors. The biggest problem I had with this taffy is I don't like licorice or peppermint flavored taffy and in the bags that I got there were a higher percentage of those two flavors than the other flavors. I won't be buying more of this taffy.

I'd consider ordering it again if I can't find a better taffy on Amazon.<br /><br />I like all the flavors, except licorice (one commenter said they didn't like the peppermint but I really like that flavor). I'm also glad there are no trans fats in it and that it's made with coconut oil.<br /><br />One of the bigger issues preventing it from getting a better rating is that I thought is was too hard and should have been softer.

review/summary: I want to love this but...
review/text: I decided to switch from a salon brand to the damage therapy shampoo and conditioner from dove. (Previous shampoo was making my hair poof, ugh).<br /><br />The first time I used it, I thought I found a keeper. My hair felt silky smooth and looked shiny. I guess it also made my hair a little limp. But for someone with thick, wavy hair that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />My problem started a month and a half after using this. I couldn't go a full day without my hair feeling grimy and super greasy looking. Yuck! And I can't wash my hair everyday because it dries out my hair and scalp too much...On day 2, I'm afraid to be seen in public lol.<br /><br />(My hairstylist said it's from the wax they use in the conditioner to make your hair look shiny and not add volume. Although, I don't see it listed as an ingredient.)<br /> Back to the drawing board :[.

review/summary: This product kicked my bad habit!
review/text: I have a habit of buying a new shampoo and half way through the bottle I buy another shampoo. I typically have 3 or 4 different bottles of shampoo in the shower at a time. I used this one until the last squeeze! I color my hair every 5-6 weeks, and this shampoo makes my hair feel clean and moisturized. The ends of my hair also feel and look smoother and less dry. As with most Dove products, the scent is fresh and clean. After I shampoo, I used the Dove intensive repair conditioner, which is also a favorite product. This shampoo has treated my hair better than salon brands that have cost between 10-15 dollars, so this one is a gem.<br /><br />Note: I had to go back and re-do this review after I realized that I had reviewed the wrong product. The pink bottle is an older Dove shampoo. The one I'm tallking about is the one featured in this review (Damage Therapy).

review/summary: Helps assist in weight loss!
review/text: Everyone needs to read about safflower oil and the CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) it contains.  Safflower oil greatly assists in the loss of belly fat, combined with a healthy diet and exercise routine.  I had plateaud at around the low 150's for about 6 months. I thought this was where my body really wanted to be, and I should just make my peace with it. Then I discovered the Shangri-La Diet and then picked safflower oil.  In 2 weeks I dropped 6 pounds and it's still falling like a rock. Mind you, I've continued my well-balanced diet and my high intensity exercise routine 3-4 days a week. I haven't changed anything else about my lifestyle. Take one tablespoon in the afternoon as your mid-afternoon "snack" and then one tablespoon at night before bed, and wash it down with water. It's been a true lifesaver.  I have also read about taking CLA pills, but it would be better (and cheaper) to go for the source.

I also find the price really reasonable. I switched from using olive oil when I read that many of the off-brand olive oils are not what they claim to be. this also has a higher smoke point. I'm also happy to find out that the added vitamin E won't break down with heat. ([...]). This is a very healthy choice, and I plan to deep-fry with it as a healthier alternative to other oils.

It's a great oil for cake-mixes because of the no-flavor factor. For stir-frys, this is also excellent because it has a decent smoke-point and the same goes for making excellent old-fashioned popcorn on the stove-top.<br /><br />This oil is also delicious mixed with oil in salad dressings for a bit 'lighter' flavor.<br /><br />Oh, and yes, this oil is very good for you [which is always a bonus].

review/summary: Is AMAZON SCAMMING safflwer oil endorsement of Dr. Oz?
review/text: This bottle looked exactly like the front label that is on a current bottle of Hollywood safflower oil I have. They do not show you the back label where it states amt. of polyunsaturated fat (only 2 when needed 7+), or any other info. In my opinion, this is deceitful. Are they trying to taking advantage of those looking for the safflower oil that Dr. Oz refers to on his show. I believe it is why they don't show the back label, but just the front. Amazon and all vendors of this and any other food product should show all the information, front and back labels. I am so disappointed in Amazon that I can't say I would purchase from them again. I now have three bottles of safflower oil that will not be used and I am out $20+ because it cannot be returned. ANYONE LOOKING FOR THIS PRODUCT GET THE CLA FROM COSTCO made by Trunature. IT IS MADE WITH PURE SAFFLOWER OIL. I HAVE BEEN USING IT AND IT WORKS. It is about $20 for a bottle of 160 or 180 softgels. I just thought I could get something a little cheaper. I wouldn't buy CLA on Amazon. It is more expensive.[...] is the place to go if you have an account. Otherwise, try Truenature.com I hope others weren't suckered like I was. I guess I should have inquired before purchase, if that is possible.

review/text: If your daily water consumption isnt at least 2.2L (for women; 3.3L for men) a day, then it really doesn't matter what kind of water you drink. Work on getting your consumption up to the minimum. If you are drinking upwards of a gallon of water a day, then picking a water of Atrisian type is greatly worth the health benefits. Also, plastic is quite detrimental to your health, so getting an item like Voss in the glass bottles instead of plastic is worth the price tag.<br /><br />Otherwise just buy 1 glass bottle of Voss and reuse the bottle if you feel the need to impress your friends. Trust me, no one drinks Voss to impress anyone. People who do are morons and everyone around them already knows it.

review/text: Wow,what ups with this water. The pH of the "still" water is 6 and the "sparkling" water is 5. Low in TDS, total dissolved minerals, the purer the water the worst it is for your health. Pure water with an acidic pH will actually rob the body (actually your bones) of valuable minerals in an attempt to neutralize the acidity. and the PRICE for all this...let's see. For adequate hydration you should drink 1/2 of your body weight in ozs per day (of healthy restructured) water. So for a 150 person that's 4.43 bottles/day and that would cost you(24 pk of Voss 16.9oz),...$7.18/day, $215/month or $2583.50/yr.<br /><br />So this water that's not really any good for your health if you equate it's price per ounce to a gallon of gasoline, you would be paying $13.35/gallon for your gas.<br /><br />Educate yourselves to what's really going on... to find out more visit www.Hydration-Sense.com

review/text: I am a tea addict and I have different teas that I drink at different times of day/night. I drink this particular tea almost exclusively when I'm at my computer writing in the evening. It's a rich black tea with a very comforting  and tasty quality. It is not "fruity" the way that herbal teas are--not at all overpowering and sweet and it's a shame that people might think it's an overly-flavored tea, it's not (Twinings should kill the word "flavored" on the box). This is probably my favorite bagged black tea and I have a hard time finding it at the local grocery stores (but there are always 97,000 kinds of berry teas from the herbal companies--blehhh!). OK, it's only tea, I'll calm down :).

review/text: I first tried this at a hotel in the UK a few years ago and fell in love with it. Sadly I couldn't find the Twinings' blackcurrant tea and had to settle for another brand at the market there, and hadn't forgotten about this since. To my elated surprise, I recently discovered that Amazon was selling them and immediately bought a TON to stock up. Should have checked a long time ago..<br /><br />This is by far my favorite tea. Rich, soothing, deliciously aromatic, it is definitely incomparable to the really strong (gross, may I add) berry type teas that too often dominate the tea aisle in the grocery stores. Love love love it. It tastes great iced, but I love mine hot, with a tad bit of honey.

review/summary: Changed for the worse
review/text: The Twinings black currant tea has always been my favorite tea, for at least 30 years.  But recently, they seem to have changed the flavor together with the packaging.  Maybe the old yellow packaging looked too much like the Earl Gray Tea package and customers were confused?  I have no idea, but please restore the old great flavor back.  This new one is almost tasteless (for black currant flavor).  I am currently looking for a better black currant tea brand, although I must admit that if I cannot find one, I may still occasionally drink this one.  I am simply hooked to black currant flavored black tea!!!

review/summary: Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor
review/text: My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents has gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given the small or mini versions of these treats, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers I give them the medium sized ones now- after some trial and error. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. This flavor smells pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh flavored ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay as a treat and the chewing action is always good, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other ones, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are relatively pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.

Flavor Swiss cheese (lowest in sodium content usually) and enjoy treats like pizza made a salt-free way.<br /><br />If you was macho taste but need to refrain from salt, this is one answer and at an affordable price.

review/summary: Watch Out for Hidden Sugar In This Blend!
review/text: I love, love, love this blend... I think it's amazing for cooking, putting on a baked potato, and my favorite, seasoning popcorn! It has a spicy kick with just a hint of sweetness, and lots of chile smoked flavor. The problem is that hint of sweetness. I use the Mrs. Dash blends because I'm on a low-sodium diet due to congestive heart failure, but I'm also by choice doing an all-natural diet, and many of the Mrs. Dash blends are a great way to season without guessing on measurements and such for spice blends, but there are some hidden culprits--for example, one of their blends has potassium chloride in it instead of salt. Well, this southwest chipotle blend is amazing in flavor, but it has SUGAR in it as one of the ingredients. Unfortunately, as much as I love it, the little bit of a sweet kick that I loved about this blend actually IS sugar and that means it's out for me. I don't eat sugar.<br /><br />But for diabetics, or those who are pre-diabetic an are watching their sugar, this product--that one wouldn't think would have sugar in it--clearly does list it in the ingredients. So be sure to check your labels on the Mrs. Dash products, because, while they are a great alternative to salt and can teach you to acclimate to more flavorful and healthier herb blends for seasoning your foods, sugar is processed and not great for you, so this flavor is one you'd have to skip.<br /><br />Otherwise, if sugar isn't an issue for you or your diet, I do highly recommend this seasoning. Seriously, try it on popcorn... amazing. I'm sad I can't have it any more!

review/summary: OK black tea - no real vanilla flavor though
review/text: I bought this because it said it was vanilla tea - but the vanilla flavor is not discernable. Not a bad tea though, like some other vanilla wannabes. Try Mighty Leaf Vanilla tea if you like vanilla.

review/summary: Great Cheese
review/text: Our recipients said the cheese was wonderful but I will say that if you are ordering as a gift make sure you wait until right before you are going to give it to buy.  The cheese itself comes in a beautiful box with ice packs but then is in a styrofoam cooler for shipment. I recommend taking it out of the cooler before giving as it can ruin the effect.

review/summary: Didn't receive what I expected
review/text: I was very disappointed, when sending this to my sister as a gift, that three of the four cheeses she received were NOT the ones advertised.  Yes, the product description includes a disclaimer about substitution, but the cheeses she received were not, in my opinion, as "exotic" as the ones advertised, and were not even the same types of cheeses.

review/summary: Gloriously Gluten-Free
review/text: I have been buying Domata Living Flour and Domata Living Flour Pizza Mix directly from the manufacturer for the last four years, and I'm delighted to see them now available through amazon.com.  The pizza mix couldn't be easier to use -- though I have found that in my humid climate I often need less than 1 part water to 2 parts mix.  My guests can't believe the pizzas are gluten-free.  In fact, I recently served pizzas to a non-celiac guest who prides himself on making the best pizza dough ever . . . and he said mine was better.  In my experience, you can tell a difference with cold pizza but not with warm or hot pizza, and it re-heats better than wheat-crust pizza doughs.  The mix keeps indefinitely in the freezer.  I buy the 25-pound bags, fill a canister with enough for short-term use and keep the rest in the freezer.  I have used other gluten-free pizza doughs, some very good and some not so good.  This is as good as the best, and much easier to use than any other I have tried.  I'd offer two suggestions:  Hold back some of the water, especially if you are making pizza in a humid environment, until you see whether the dough is sticky or just right.  Save some flour for dusting the work surface and the top of the dough when you roll it out, to prevent sticking to the rolling pin or the work surface.
