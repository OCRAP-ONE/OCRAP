review/text: My daughter introduced me to this delicious drink mix that helps satisfy sweet and yummy flavors when trying to lose weight. I put one package in a slim thermos with hot water and it lasts for hours. I like it especially in the morning. In the evening you can add a shot of apple schnapps or peach schnapps to the hot drink mix and it really helps take the edge off the day without overdoing. I love it! Shipping was really fast too.

review/summary: Misleading Labeling, Horrible for Dieting or Losing weight, causes huge insulin spikes from sugar replacement Maltodextrin
review/text: Really one of the worse drink mixes for dieting or losing weight.<br /><br />I bought this from the good reviews and the fact that it was sugar free with only 15 calories (i'm sugar sensitive), but I never read the ingrediants and didn't realize it contains a super sugar (technically its not sugar, but basically it is) Maltodextrin, a sugar like substance with the same calorie base as suagr thats 200% more toxic and creates a bigger insulin response with just 4grams in each packet vs 25 grams in a normal sugar apple cider packet.<br /><br />When I first drank this I knew there was something wrong, I immediatly got a sugar high from just 1 cup, I started to gain weight.  I did some research and discovered that the company used malodextrin in place of sugar, this is 200% times worse. It has a glycemic index of 120 while sugar is only 50-60, it gives a insulin response that is equivalent to eating a quarter pound of sugar, I was crashing at work and eating more for no reason, all from the abnormally high insulin response from the malodextrin.<br /><br />Maltodextrin is so toxic that it will keep your insulin levels high for 8 hours afterwards, basically everything you eat will turn to fat.<br /><br />So yes its lower calorie, but the Malodextrin in it is just telling your body to eat more and turn everything into fat.  Horrible, don't buy if you're trying to lose weight<br /><br />On the positive, if your a bodybuilder this is a great pre workout drink, or marathon drink, as the sugar (malodexrin) will easily be absorbed into your muscles

review/summary: Unbelievably Potent :)
review/text: Recently, after speaking with the owner of a local Chinese restaurant, I inquired about their outrageously HOT mustard served only upon request.  I was curious to find out if and where I could purchase this condiment to enjoy at home.  The owner explained that the mustard was prepared daily from a powder simply mixed with water to the desired consistency.  Having been repeatedly disappointed with the mainstream bottled grocery varieties labelled as "hot", a little online research certainly paid off! This ISN'T that lame packet mustard you commonly find in the bottom of your take out bag.  S&B oriental mustard ROCKS!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Nice 3oz quantity for personal home use for dipping, sauces, etc. [A little will go a very long way]<br />* Sturdy and airtight canister for storage<br />* "Scald Your Sinuses Hot" [Assuming you enjoy this trait--sure hope you do]<br />* Flexibility to freshly prepare only the amount needed at a given time--prepared mustard will lose potency/heat if stored over time.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Powder should be handled with care--seriously potent and cannot imagine getting powder directly into eyes, cuts, etc. Children and novices beware!<br /><br />Would certainly recommend to any and all of those folks [you know who you are] like myself who derive pleasure from a truly HOT mustard for dipping, egg rolls, spicy Chex mix, and other creative recipe ideas. CANNOT BEAT IT! :)

review/text: I used to buy this product in the grocery store until they stopped carrying it.  We have tried so many different brands of Oriental hot mustard and never found one that we liked, but they were available in the grocery store.  Their quality never came close to the S&B brand.  I decided to look online for the S&B brand and found it here.  I will continue to purchase the S&B brand and no longer experiment with other brands.  We both think there is no comparison for the taste and consistency.

review/summary: Just like the hot mustard I love in Chinese restaurants
review/text: Despite my constant polite reminders, when making deliveries, my favorite Chinese-food restaurant often fails to include hot yellow mustard to compliment the sweet and sour sauce that typically comes with egg rolls and other side dishes. I'd tried several bottled mustard products, looking for something comparable to what I've had in Chinese restaurants, and found all of them disappointing. After doing some further research, I learned that when exposed to water, the intense chemicals which give hot mustard its spice begins to break down almost immediately, although refrigeration can delay that process. So I ordered this S&B Oriental Hot Mustard powder, which comes in a small tin with a traditional pry-off lid (under which was a modern vacuum-sealed foil/plastic liner).<br /><br />As I write this review, my sinus cavities are nicely cleared, and my tummy is nicely full of nicely spiced, digesting egg roll: This is the real deal, and it has a serious kick to it. I thought it would be inconvenient as compared to a bottled (pre-mixed) product, but this is just dirt simple -- or perhaps I should say, "mud simple": a little powder mixed with just enough cold water to moisten it, and you can smell this stuff start to react. Within moments, and certainly well before my egg rolls had begun to cool, I had a mustard paste that looked and tasted exactly like what I like to find in those condiment pots on the tables of traditional Chinese restaurants.

review/text: You know what "normal" yellow mustard tastes like. S&B hot mustard ain't that. This is a dry powder you mix with water and allow to sit a minute or two to develop the full flavor.<br />And by flavor I mean an all out assault on your nasal passages (especially if you try too much!). It's kinda like English mustard but even more intense. (I am sure this mustard will play a lead role in "The Expendables 3").<br />Anyway this mustard smells/tastes similar to the little packets of hot mustard you get at Chinese restaurants but with much more WAHOO!<br />If you haven't been scared off yet I recommend trying it. If you do find it is too hot you need to either go back to the temple and retrain OR you could try diluting it with ketchup, soy sauce, or even your own tears.<br />The little tin should last a long time since you don't need a whole lot (I would say following the instructions on the tin will make too much).<br />I hope you find this review useful!

review/text: I used to live in Florida and would get hot mustard from a Chinese place that would make my eyes water and really open up my sinuses.  Since I moved 5 years ago I have been looking for something similar, and finally I have found it.  This is a nice 3 ounce jar of powder that must be mixed with water.  I mix 1 teaspoon of powder with 1.5 teaspoons of water, and then let it sit for 5 minutes or so.  It has a good consistency and that wonderful hot flavor that you get from Chinese mustard.  This heat level blows away any pre-mixed stuff in a jar that you can get at a grocery store.  Since you can mix how much or little you need, this jar can last a really long time. Highly recommended.

Simply mix the powder with cold water and let it sit for a couple of minutes and you have mustard that cleans out your sinuses, like you get at a real quality Chinese restaurant -- not the pathetic "hot" mustard that is in packets at Americanized Chinese restaurants.<br /><br />You can make small amounts at a time because it doesn't take much, so a can like this is an incredible value.<br /><br />Whenever I have some of this, I feel like I'm at WoHop in Chinatown in New York.

review/summary: Awesome Oriental Mustard
review/text: I first found this mustard in an oriental shop near Atlanta, GA.  I had used all I had and couldn't find it locally so reverted to the internet.  The vendor was great, the price fair and the product arrived to my fullest expectation and satisfaction.  I will continue to use this product and the vendor. It is the best hot mustard I have ever found - a tremendous taste that always enhances the meal.

review/text: A lot of the reviews claim that some of the pieces were hard or dry. Every package of jerky is going to have it's bad pieces. However, I have bought this stuff a couple of times, and 98% of the pieces are great! Are a few pieces tough? SURE, is it less tasty? Nope! The price is pretty decent, and the quality is top notch. There is no fat in any of the pieces. If you are an extremely picky person, you will find flaws in ANYTHING! Nothing is perfect, but this is close.

review/text: I found World Kitchens Peppered Beef Jerky at a gas station mini-mart on my way camping one time. It was the BEST peppered beef jerky I had ever had. When I started looking into buying more, I found that it wasn't easy to find. My local giant chain Mart store had it for a while but discontinued carrying it. Finding it at Amazon and "subscribing" offers a pretty good savings. 5 STARS!!

review/summary: Great jerky.
review/text: I was surprised at the all around taste and texture for a brand I did not recognize until shopping on Amazon. I've been a regular jerky eater and have been trying the more well known brands too. This is not the big burly (hard to eat IMO) dinosaur jerky you can buy from Co**** It is smaller, chews well and has a medium taste. It is slightly moist when first opened and this imparts an easy chew. I also like to leave the bag slightly unsealed to "dry out" the jerky a little more. This also gives it a unique taste. Great product and a great price so I am subscribing to have it shipped regularly at an even lower price. Enjoy.

review/text: If I didn't have to add so much of this to my mug I would have given it 5 stars. It is wonderful; so much so that two different stores are often sold out. That tells you something.<br /> It is so irritating to race to the coffee aisle and .... nothing. So I got this for free shipping.<br /> If it isn't sweet enough for you, here's a suggestion: add a teaspoon of sugar to the cup . lol The chocolate or mocha tastes too much like hot chocolate mix. I have 3/4 of a can and my vanilla is almost empty. Add too much and you'll get candida and itch all night. It might be worth it !!<br />Thanks , Amazon!!

review/summary: Not the best.
review/text: I bought this in hopes that I could make a great French Vanilla Cappuccino at home, instead of having to stop at WAWA (store on the east coast) everyday. Unfortunately, this wasn't what I was looking for.<br /><br />The instructions say to add a few scoops and then add more as needed. I was up to six scoops in a 16 ounce mug, before I gave up realizing that it wasn't going to be as sweet as I was looking for.  If you don't want your cappucino particualarly sweet, then you'll probably be able to deal with it, but if you've got a sweet tooth like me, then skip this.

review/text: This is a waste of money if you are looking for the french vanilla flavor it just doesn't have any.  I ended up giving away 5 of the 6 cans.  The mocha by Folger's is excellent and you can taste the chocolate.  I thought the french vanilla would be the same but it was just a sweet coffee.  I purchased the Victorian Inn brand and from the reviews this has a good vanilla taste; I hope so because I was trully disappointed in this Folger's French Vanilla.

review/text: Buying high quality sardines is getting to seem ipossible. Even name brands are suspect anymore. The Vigo brand are reaally good and not mushy like the previoud brands I purchased. Nice firm sardines in a good tomato sauce that is not overpowering. They're certainly worth the price!

review/summary: Great Price on a great product!!
review/text: Our "kids", one American and one Bristish cocker spaniel love these.  We referred to them as toothbrushes and they get one every morning as per our vets advice.  It is amazing how these have improved their teeth and gums, but it has done wonders for their breath!! When we first started using these we bought them at a local national chain pet store and they were so expensive.  This is the best price I have been able to find on them and I love that they come to my front door!!!

review/summary: King of Root Beers
review/text: Hi,<br /><br />  I am a HUGE Root Beer Fanatic.  I have always loved the Natural, micro brew, old fashioned root beers.  But for some reason the root beer I liked the best was Boylan's Root beer which ironically is an artificial root beer.  Then one day I was strolling throught the soda section of my local health food store looing for some natural root beers when I stumbled upon Boylan's "The Natural Kind" Root Beer.  I almost fainted right there in the aisle!  It was my favorite root beer only better! it was made micro-brew style with REAL ingredients.  Then for about 2 months I was constantly in and out of the store getting that root beer.  I was just like the Boylan's root beer that I had come to love only it was, as I said above, better!  First of all, the second you taste the root beer you can tell the quality of craftsman-ship that went into making the root beer.  The root beer is creamy and velvetly smoothe.  It just slides down your throat.  The amazing thing is that you then notice that it is definitley the signature Boylan's cane sugar root beer flavor.  The flavor is deep and complex but mild.  I know this sounds contradictory but you'll understand when you taste it for yourself.  Then something terrible happened.  I was going into the store to get my weekly bottle only to find that the store had discontinued the root beer.  I was so upset I seriously almost cried.  But then I have discoverd that Amazon.com sells it.  I can't stress to you enough how much I like this root beer.<br /><br />  -Desty

review/summary: The Ultimate Root Beer?
review/text: Since January this year I've been taste-testing a number of different root beers and related beverages (birch beers, sarsaparillas, even a spruce beer--ick!) Some are available here at Amazon, others not.<br /><br />But Bolyan's Natural has beaten them all for the top spot in my reorder list.<br /><br />Saranac, with its unique chocolate notes (also available through Amazon), comes in a close second. And I'm very fond of Barrel Bros, Capt'n Eli's, and Jackson Hole (normal root beers); also of Rhode Island Molasses (more of an earthy, smoky tasting sarsaparilla) and Bundaberg (basically their unique ginger beer modified into a sarsaparilla). I'll be reordering some of these again, too.<br /><br />But Boylan's, with its careful approach of combining birch oils (not nearly as overpowering as their straight-up birch beer), sassafras, vanilla, and basically everything else on which various root beer variants are based, has formulated a root beer that incorporates a little of everything in just the right amounts to be tasted without anything overwhelming anything else.<br /><br />Well done Boylan. Expensive, but well done. {g}

review/text: Frankly, I could care less if you don't like this review.  This natural root beer is delicious.  Smooth taste and low carbonation. Glides across the tongue and down the throat.  And, on its way down to your stomach you can taste every molecule of this natural root beer soda. Pop the top and pour this amazing root beer into a freezing cold mug over ice. Life is good with Boylan's Natural Root Beer.

review/summary: Quaker Instant Oatmeal Express
review/text: Quaker Instant Oatmeal Express offers a nutritious, flavourful breakfast for the commuter. It is a wonderful breakfast for home as well. The need for a bowl is eliminated as it comes in its own disposable bowl, requiring only water to the fill line before placement in the microwave for 90 seconds on high. More oatmeal is contained in this bowl than in the individual pouches.<br /><br />The Golden Brown Sugar is my favourite flavour. It is delicious!<br /><br />This product is highly recommended.

No worries about bringing/cleaning your own bowl or (e-gads!) using a bowl already at the office. I know, not very environmentally friendly but have you seen how some other people wash the "office" dishes?

review/summary: He likes them, but I don't think he loves them...
review/text: To be fair, our dog is spoiled.  He gets treats regularly.  Among his favorites are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007A0AP8">Zuke's Jerky Naturals Dog Treats, Lamb, 6-Ounce</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a>.<br /><br />I thought I would try out the Wellness treats because we just switched him to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HYB2P0">Wellness Super5Mix Dry Dog Food, Small Breed Adult Health Recipe, 12-Pound Bag</a> and he LOVES it.  Before that, he was on Science Diet.  While he does like these treats, I have seen him snub away from them before.  He will, however, never snub away from a Zuke's.<br /><br />I will say that the Zuke's are more potent so maybe that's why he's drawn more to them.  The Wellness WellBites are a good product though.  The ingredients seem to be good and Wellness brand is recommended by our vet.<br /><br />I think we're going to stick with the Zuke's.  He likes them more and they're cheaper.  I would suggest trying both out for your pet, that's what we did.  There isn't too much of a price difference so it's worth a shot.<br /><br />I knocked one star off because he does not love them as much as the Zuke's.  I will probably try another flavor out in the future though to see if he likes those.

She chooses them over some other high-end treats that it wouldn't be nice for me to name here. The WellBites are soft so you can easily break them into food, put them in toys, etc. And they're made with healthy ingredients. WellBites are a win-win: Tasty and Healthy. Excellent treat! Highly recommend!
