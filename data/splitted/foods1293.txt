review/summary: mint or cookie dough flavors = amazing
review/text: I have read some of the reviews on here and yeah the chocolate peanut butter and the chocolate are kind of weird and sort of taste like a frozen protein shake. The vanilla maple and the strawberry banana flavors are watery in a sorbet kind of way but still very delicious. The mint and cookie dough flavors, however, are AMAZING. Totally rich and creamy and delicious. So give those flavors a try before you make your judgment!

review/summary: Love the flavor but it is different
review/text: I dont buy this stuff because of the calories, I just like it.  The flavor is not overwhelming, and a nice chocolate, without tasting sickening. The peanut butter flavor mild and good. They could bring that out a little more, for my taste. But tasty, ice cream texture, and very filling. I loved it, and loved the fact I can have it without feeling bad about the calories. I plan to try some other flavors! This stuff is really good, nice texture, light flavor, and very refreshing. It is not really. But it's a good substitute during the week when you really want some ice cream! The flavor is rich enough that I feel satisifed with a smaller portion than I would normally have.

review/text: Arctic Zero is so good, but I wish they would carry it in a store somewhere near me. My favorite is the choc. p.b. and the choc. is good too. The vanilla doesn't really have that much of a taste to me so it's not worth the high price. No, it's not ice cream, and doesn't really taste like ice cream, but it is a delicious, satisfying, and very low cal treat that you can enjoy without the guilt! Whoever's in charge of sales should get out there so it could be made readily available to the customers who would even buy more!

review/summary: Great ice cream alternative!
review/text: After losing 73lbs, I am constantly on the lookout for low-cal/carb alternatives to my favorite foods.  Well, after receiving my first shipment of Arctic Zero Choc. PB, I think I have found my new favorite "ice cream".  The texture is great- very close to "real" ice cream and it doesn't seem to melt as fast.  The flavor is great- mild and not SO good that I would be tempted to binge- although, even if I did, the entire pint is only 128 calories, so it wouldn't be a problem!<br /><br />Also, there are only 36g of Sugar in the entire pint- if you're trying to keep your carbs low, you can still have half of the pint (or more if you're maintaining) and still be well within your daily target.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Not even close to being as good as the other flavors.
review/text: Unless you're a die hard chocolate fan, I wouldn't recommend this product. Even then it's just way too overdone in the flavor department. It takes like a old candy bar that's been sitting around for 10 years, covered with sawdust and protein powder, and then frozen. I've tried almost all of the arctic zero flavors and it's definitely the one that tastes the most like chemicals. Chocolate flavored chemicals, but chemicals nonetheless. On a positive note it's still better tasting than protein shakes I've had that have the same nutritional value but that's not saying much.<br /><br />If you're looking to try arctic zero for the first time, head over to maple vanilla. It passes for frozen yogurt without a problem and has an awesome taste.

review/summary: A Mouth-Freezing Calorie-Counter's Delight
review/text: If you would rather eat a quarter cup of gourmet ice cream rather than settle for a low-calorie alternative, then this product is not for you.  However, if you are a weight-watcher who loves good ice cream but who is never satisfied with a dollop, then ARCTIC ZERO is made for you.<br /><br />Arctic Zero will freeze your mouth and your hands.  It will make you bundle up and dig in.  Great fun!<br /><br />A word of warning, though: I think this low-calorie confection needs chocolate to make it taste good (at least until you get used to the funky non-ice-cream flavor).  I got chocolate peanut butter (good) and Vanilla with Maple (er... well... not so good...).<br /><br />I ate the entire pint of chocolate peanut butter 2 hours ago, and I'm still feeling full (I can't believe I ate the WHOLE thing... and I shouldn't have... and won't next time).<br /><br />I didn't really taste the "peanut butter" part of the recipe, but I don't eat this stuff for its promised flavor. I eat it so that I can remain virtuous while indulging.<br /><br />Arctic Zero more than fulfills my expectations.

review/text: I just received my order yesterday and I'm really happy with this product.  I'm not the hugest fan of chocolate ice cream but bought this because of the HG recommendation.  I liked it pretty well on it's own but when I mixed it with some PB2 it tasted just like Edy's peanut butter cup ice cream--yum!  I wasn't tempted to eat the whole pint--it is rich enough that a cup mixed with the PB2 was plenty and that has about the same amount of calories as the whole pint.  I think it would taste good with Better n' Peanut Butter too for a treat with a few more calories.

review/summary: Fabulous healthy treat that tastes pretty darn good!
review/text: I was a little skeptical about this product before I purchased it. However, I decided to try it out due to the positive reviews.  I'm glad I did.  For the unbelievably low calorie count for 1 pint of a frosty treat, this is a must buy!  Is it just like ice cream? No.  Is it a good substitute for something cold, relatively creamy and pleasant tasting? YES.  I still don't know how they pack only 128 calories into this magical treat, but I guess I won't ask too many questions and instead just enjoy it while I have it.  It is pricey and I would love to see the price drop a bit for repeat customers of this product perhaps, but overall I am very impressed.

review/summary: Whoa - this stuff is good.
review/text: I really like this stuff.  The chocolate flavor is really nice and chocolatey.  Even though it's basically a frozen protein shake, it doesn't taste all that "healthy" to me.  It occupies me and keeps me from eating something that really would be bad, like a big chocolate bar.<br /><br />If you look at the arctic zero website, there's a ton of information about why their product is healthy for you.  It even goes so far as to suggest that it prevents cancer.  I don't know about all that, but I do like the ice cream.<br /><br />Now if they could just do something about the price...<br /><br />Oh - and I almost forgot.  They got this stuff all the way from California to me in New York and even though it sat at my door all day until I got home from work, it was still frozen rock solid.  And it's summer!  They do a good job on shipping.

review/summary: Calorie Count Massively Low Per Independent Testing
review/text: This product's label says that it contains 11 grams of carbohydrate (including 9 g sugars and 0 g fiber) and 4 g protein per half-cup serving. This should mean that it contains about 60 Calories, yet the label says it has only about half of that (32, for 150 Calories per pint). The manufacturer's website justifies the low Calorie count with a very scientific-sounding explanation of why the body will not absorb all the sugar, but there is no actual testing in humans or even mice to prove that this fairy tale actually matches reality.<br /><br />ABC's Today Show recently tested <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002915VF2">Arctic Zero Chocolate Peanut Butter</a> along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002912506">Arctic Zero Maple Vanilla</a>, and found that "Arctic Zero Vanilla Maple had a whopping 46 percent more calories than the label. The Chocolate Peanut Butter: an incredible 68 percent more calories." If you do the math, 68% more Calories than 32 is 63 -- almost exactly what you'd calculate from looking at the protein and carb.<br /><br />You can find the report by Googling "Rossen Reports: Can you believe diet frozen dessert labels?"

review/summary: Artic Zero Rocks!
review/text: First off, this is not ice cream, it's "frozen dessert", exactly what it says on the package. The 2 main ingredients are purified water and whey protein concentrate so for those complaining about how this product doesn't taste like ice cream....PURIFIED WATER, WHEY PROTEIN....now ask yourself why you are complaining. I mean, there's a taste difference between mixing protein powder in milk vs water, right? Now you are starting to understand......but, if you are still expecting it to taste rich and creamy like ice cream, then you are an idiot!<br /><br />People who regularly supplement their diet with whey protein should and will absolutely appreciate this product. Compared to all the "reduced calorie" or "half the fat" this and that type ice creams and frozen yogurts, it's nice to know there is a frozen treat product out there that actually has a solid nutritional profile. The only downside is that it's expensive for only 14 grams of protein.<br /><br />I hope this product stays around for a long time!

review/text: I love ice cream, and my standards are very low when the calorie/fat count is right.  Unfortunately, this is completely tasteless.  I didn't mind the texture so much - it's creamy, cold, close enough to ice-cream, but it has no flavour and no sweetness.  I even tried melting it a bit and adding Splenda, but it didn't help.  I tried the maple flavour as well, and found it equally bad - actually, I don't think I could tell the difference between the two.

review/summary: Blech
review/text: I had high hopes for this product. I was having a craving for frozen yogurt, and decided to give this a try instead, in the chocolate peanut butter flavor. It's pretty gross. The first thing that hits you is artificial peanut flavor. The label says it contains "natural flavors" but nowhere does it say that peanuts are involved. So, this is probably just peanut flavor instead of actual peanuts. Just like strawberry flavor in place of real strawberries, the flavor is off-putting, too strong and intense. The texture is fine, but this product is similar to ice milk, if anyone remembers that horrid stuff. It just melts into peanut flavored-ice. Not appealing. I paid over $4 for the pint, and really wish I would have chosen the frozen greek yogurt. I took two bites and stuffed it back into the freezer. I might try it in smoothies for a morning protein shake or something, but I will never eat this straight from the container  again. Blech! They should just use real peanut butter for pete's sake, if they intend to call it chocolate peanut butter!

review/text: I was very excited to find a lactose friendly ice cream that was a different flavor other than vanilla. However, this is not even close to tasting like ice cream. It has an extremely strange texture and the taste is disgusting. I tried to give it a chance, but after 5 spoonfuls, I threw out the entire pint. $5 down the drain, but that's better than the torture of ingesting this "ice cream". You are better off buying a soy based ice cream. These are actually very good, as long as you are used to the taste of soy, and the consistency is just like ice cream. Word to the wise, don't buy this! It's not worth the money or disappointment.

In my opinion, it is not a good substitute at all.  It doesn't taste like peanut butter at all and barely tastes like chocolate.  My daughter tasted it and thought it tasted gross.  I wouldn't go that far but I will never buy it again - especially since it costs so much more than ice cream.  I'll probably take the suggestions of other reviewers and use it as a base for a shake. I have only tried the chocolate peanut butter flavor so I can't vouch for the other flavors.

However even though this does not taste awful I would not buy it again even if I could not have any other frozen "treat", as it is easy to make a protein shake with chocolate and peanut butter that is healthier and taste better than this. And although they are not low calorie, there are other gluten free, lactose free, sugar free/low sugar options to choose from that taste a lot better than Arctic Zero.

review/summary: Misleading marketing of a modestly above-mediocre product
review/text: Why can't they promote this product honestly?<br /><br />It's not a *bad* product. I didn't find it actually objectionable. It's mildly sweet, and has a sort of nondescript, chocolate-simulating flavor. On its own merits, If I were in a really great mood I might even give it four stars in spite of its relative synthetic blandness and the lack of peanut butter or any resemblance to its flavor. They've actually accomplished something fairly worthwhile in creating a frozen dessert with so few calories, and I'd give it some appreciation on that basis.<br /><br />But ... "ice cream replacement"?  "Smooth and creamy"?  It is neither of these, by any estimation. It's an "ice cream replacement" only in the sense that yogurt or pudding or a ham sandwich are -- as things one might eat instead of ice cream. It's objectively not "smooth", and anyone expecting it to be (for example, because they read the label) is going to be highly upset to find that it is instead gritty and grainy, so much so that it actually makes sound when you pass a spoon through it, similar to scooping packed wet sand. It has a mouthfeel more like a poorly-made sherbet; the ice crystals are large enough that you can almost see them. This doesn't mean it can't be "good" -- snow cones are super gritty with huge ice crystals and they're still well-liked.<br /><br />Overall, it was okay. I definitely like that I can eat small amounts of this stuff even on a keto diet. I think they've got a good product idea, and it deserves a slot on the shelf next to the other frozen desserts.<br /><br />But, a note to the Arctic Zero folks -- celebrate your product and promote it for what it IS. Why spoil your efforts by lying about what you've made?

review/summary: Some flavors better than others
review/text: When purchasing Ice Cream I would choose vanilla over chocolate. So, I first tried the Maple Vanilla. The texture was icy, and it was okay but you can taste the Whey protein alot. Even though I don't like coffee, I do like coffee ice cream, Artic Zero's Coffee flavor was creamier than the Maple Vanilla and was just okay, but the Whey Protein taste is still there. The Chocolate is creamy and by far my favorite, no Whey protein taste at all, really the closest to ice cream. My second favorite would be the Mint Chocolate cookies, again creamy and no whey protein taste, big surprise since I hate mint chocolate chip ice cream. Chocolate Peanut Butter is good as well,and doesn't have the whey protein taste.I have never had Pumkin ice cream but it also tasted pretty good without the why protein taste. The Strawberry is horrible, icy with a very strong whey protein taste. Being on a reduce calorie diet and getting ice cream that is also high in protein and fiber is a BIG winner for me.

I've eaten some weird things in my day in the name of good nutrition, and completely enjoyed them, but this is one of the worst experiences I've had with diet food, hands down. The flavor was awful, I would venture to say disgusting. So much so that this stayed in my freezer for over four months. Every week or so I'd give it another shot and take a few bites, remember how disgusting it is, and be done. I guess on the bright side, I was always so grossed out that my cravings and desires for food would just disappear completely out the window. I finally ended up throwing the rest of it into a protein shake, which was still gross.

I have no idea how anyone could ever eat the entire pint -- I couldn't eat an entire pint of Ben and Jerry's! But I had regular ice cream (Chunk Monkey by the aforementioned B and J) and this stuff. I was very pleased. The flavor is light -- gentle chocolate, without tasting sickening. The peanut butter flavor is very, very gentle. They could bring that out a little more, in my opinion. But yummy, ice cream/sorbet texture, and very filling. I loved it, and loved the fact I can have it guilt-free. Can't wait to try some other flavors!

review/summary: Awesome!!
review/text: I just received my order today and I love it! The packaging was done very well. It was almost 100 degrees with the humidity and I didn't get home until 8pm and most of the cartons were still frozen. I don't love the packing peanuts though. The ice cream itself is surprisingly rich and creamy. The flavor was nice...not too strong or sweet. It was so rich I didn't think there would be any way I could eat the whole thing. Well...I did! You definitely don't need to though because it does leave you satisfied. I would completely stock my freezer full if it weren't so expensive. It's hard to justify spending so much on ice cream. Definitely worth it for the occasional treat though. Please sell in NYC shops!!

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I really liked this product, it tasted much better than I thought it was going to and it was great eating an entire pint for only 128 calories.  It also satisfied my craving for ice cream, as it is very filling. I was concerned about the delivery of the product, but it arrived quickly and was in great condition, especially since it was sitting outside in 100 degree weather. I know that I will continue to buy this product, the only drawback is that it is rather pricey for only 6 pints.

review/summary: DON'T BUY this on AMAZON!!!!!
review/text: OK. First off, the price for this stuff online is incredibly expensive. The price for each pint on Amazon is $6.00! I bought this at my Publix, and it was about $4.00 per pint. So, when I got home, the "ice cream" was a little melty, which is what most people said tasted best. They're right! If you don't set the arctic zero on the counter for ten minutes before you eat, it's going have the texture of Italian ice. The texture of the "soft" arctic zero was like sherbet. Pretty good for 35 calories a 1/2 cup! I can taste the chocolate and peanut butter flavor. It is kind of muted though. It tastes just like a chocolate fudgesicle! I want to try vanilla maple next!

review/summary: LOVE IT!!!
review/text: I eat Arctic Zero pretty often and crave this stuff when I want some creamy chocolatey goodness!! (Doesn't help that I live half a block from Whole Foods and pass a Sprouts store on the way to work every day :)) My favorite flavors are Chocolate Peanut Butter and Coffee!! (I don't eat the coffee at night though-caffeine)<br /><br /> I've noticed, however, that each pint of Chocolate PB has varying amounts of the subtle peanut butter. I actually add a teaspoon of natural organic peanut butter when I have some AZ, because its a healthy monounsaturated fat and in low portions, keeps me slim!!  Love the contrast of textures! If you don't want to add PB to the Chocolate PB flavor, try softening at room temp rather than in the microwave, as it does slightly change the flavor and denatures the whey protein.<br /><br />I make a mini meal out if sometimes by stirring in some organic plain, nonfat greek yogurt like Stonyfield, to add protein and creaminess to it! Yumminess!!<br />However, I most often eat a serving in a little ice cream dish with a sprinkle of ginger, nutmeg or some chia seeds or berries.<br /><br />I was just amazed at how many people find the taste lacking and amused that one person accused others of working for the company because their opinions differed from hers. I believe I know why such a wide range of opinions here:<br /><br />Depends upon the condition of your palate and sensitivity of your taste buds.<br />Some people are supertasters, other not. However there are environmental factors. The more sweet and processed foods you eat, the more dull your taste buds become, craving more sweet and processed flavors, because you've conditioned your taste buds accordingly.<br /><br />Usually, the cleaner your diet, the more sensitive your taste buds will become. I see this often with my patients who give up soda (especially diet soda), and they report having less sugar cravings from just that switch.<br /><br />Also, as people age, their taste buds also grow duller/weaker. This is why seniors often love very rich/sweet foods, because their taste buds can pick up some of the taste, whereas blander foods are harder for them to taste.<br /><br />Love Arctic Zero. Wish they'd make a mocha flavor!

review/summary: Couldn't be happier with Arctic Zero!
review/text: I just got my delivery yesterday (6 pints Choc. Peanut Butter, 6 pints Vanilla Maple) and I've already polished off a pint of this Chocolate PB- it's THAT GOOD. I read about Arctic Zero on Hungry Girl and was anxious to give it a try, seeing as the calorie count is ridiculously low. This is the perfect ice cream substitute, hands down. I didn't know what to expect as far as texture, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it nice and creamy- like a cross between frozen yogurt and ice cream. This Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor is insane, so much tastier (and better for you) than all the artificially flavored "diet" treats I've tried. The Vanilla Maple is great too and I can't wait to try making some smoothies and shakes with both flavors. Bottom line, I don't think it's an overstatement to say this stuff is life-changing. Try it and you won't be dissapointed- and spread the word! We need Arctic Zero to get bigger and bigger so it becomes more available nationwide- I'd love to see this in my grocery store.

review/text: Very cute. Mine is a little tilted, he leans to one side--the legs weren't assembled straight, but it's still functional. The only thing I don't like is that the dispenser gives about 15 m&ms at once and you have to make sure to catch them when you use the lever in the back--they just fly out because it's such a large opening. The good thing is that I should be able to refill with peanut m&ms (they came with regular).

review/summary: Should be advertised as a scrumptious sedative!
review/text: Abuelita is a Mexican chocolate drink. It comes in tablets or packet form, but I prefer the tablets. The directions call for you to use one entire tablet, but I would think that would be too much. I use about 1/3 of a tablet and 2 1/2 cups of milk. You heat the milk until it is warm enough, but do not boil. When blended, it creates a nice froth. I like to have Abuelita before bed. It must be something about the warm milk and subtle chocolate and cinnamon flavor, but regardless of how wired I am, Abuelita puts me right to sleep.It has a complex, but lovely flavor. The bottom of the mug can be a bit gritty if not fully blended, but even that is not unpleasant. Try Abuelita and you will be able to swear off any sleeping pills!

review/text: Alright I am finally sitting down and doing this review. It's only been about a week since I received my Red Leaf Tea order, but I've had this tea three separate occasions since then. Every time I went to sit down and write a review - I was already finished my cup and I didn't quite know what to say.<br /><br />I think I understand what took me so long. This is a seriously mysterious matcha. When I opened the package and took a whiff, I associated the sweet vanilla smell with something else, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I whisked up a cup between 175-185 degrees - the matcha itself was bright, vegetal, creeeamy and full of vanilla deliciousness. Definite vanilla bean or real vanilla extract - a flavour that isn't sweet but is associated with baking. When I bake with my 3 tablespoons+ of real vanilla - it always smells sooo delicious and sweet, but if you were to taste it itself - it doesn't taste how it smells. That's the opposite of this matcha - it really does taste how it smells - I think that's where the mystery came from.<br /><br />Finally I associated the smell with the matcha whipped shortbread I made a while back. Of course! It smells and tastes like delicious flour, sugar, matcha and vanilla! Since I ate over a dozen of those cookies, it's now obvious where that taste association comes from haha. Love it.  I really want to do a comparison of this vs the new French Vanilla matcha. Subtle but delicious differences I'm sure!<br /><br />Oh man I just got an awesome idea. Mini matcha shortbreads for summer, using the different flavours of matcha! Ah! I can't wait to see how the flavour translates into a simple flour, butter, sugar cookie. Paired with an iced matcha. On the front porch. Okay I don't have a front porch : ( But I have the makings of the rest of it :D<br /><br />I don't know if I mentioned this in my other reviews - but this matcha (and the others) has an amazing echo of taste. The aftertaste of the natural flavours lingers long after I'm finished the cup. To be honest, it kind of makes me crave more. If I wasn't already bouncing off the walls with matcha energy, I might make more! No joke. This stuff packs a serious energy punch. I've been having it every morning! I feel lucky :)

review/summary: Great beginner matcha
review/text: I certainly would not classify this as a "blah" tea, but when I want something flavoured it isn't what I'll reach for - the vanilla flavour is there, but I had hoped for stronger. I made some before work today, and as it cooled (I find it gets better as it cools) I just kept thinking that it tasted like extra smooth regular matcha. Like a toned-down on the grassiness matcha, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think this would be perfect for someone who has been newly introduced to matcha, or for someone who maybe had a bad first experience. If I had tried this as my first matcha, I think I would have thought "Ooh....matcha is awesome!". What I really thought was: "This is interesting....but I think I need to try more before I decide."<br /><br />The Madagascar Vanilla is definitely something that I can see being great in baking or smoothies, and I have read about a few people mixing it with other flavours such as mint (that may be something I need to try in the future!). I can also see it being a go-to tea to make when I'm not sure exactly what I want. I do wonder though how different the French Vanilla matcha is from the Madagascar Vanilla. I may have to place another order soon to compare...<br /><br />The best thing about this matcha is that it seems to be pretty versatile...I feel like I could probably use it to extend the life of some other kinds if I really wanted to. The taste is mellow and smooth, and there is no artificial taste to the vanilla flavoring. I recently noticed that on the Red Leaf Tea website they have an option for a "2 in 1 custom matcha", and I think this would be a really awesome option to use as one of the flavors. I'm not sure I will pick up more of this when it is gone, but that is more due to the fact that there are so many different kinds that I want to try. I could see me coming back to this sometime in the future.

The base in this matcha is far better than many other matcha I have around and then to consider all the flavors this company offers! Its astounding! This particular vanilla is not as strong as some - such as french vanilla but if you want your flavors to taste as natural as the flavor additives Red Leaf Tea uses then this is your vanilla!

review/summary: Tasty Healthy Yummy Treat!
review/text: For the past two days every time I walk past my tin of Red Leaf Tea's Madagascar Vanilla Matcha, I have to stop and smell it. It really is an indescribable wonderful smell!<br />I have had this Matcha in Red Leaf's "2 in 1" option combined with Caramel Matcha and it was heaven. This time around I bought each of those flavors separately so I could use them individually or combined. This past weekend, my awesome daughter bought me a Magic Bullet blender because I have been so into making tea based drinks and smoothies etc. Already I have used this amazing flavored Madagascar Vanilla Matcha to make some super scrumptious smoothies. This morning I added it to a peach greek yogurt smoothie and it was delicious. Vanilla goes so well with so many fruits such as strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. Or this Matcha is spectacular all by itself, hot or cold. This flavor Matcha remains my top favorite and I believe I will be reordering this probably every order I place with Red Leaf because you just can't go wrong with this one. (Perhaps I should give Red Leaf's French Vanilla Matcha a chance though!)<br />Besides tasting so yummy, one cup of Matcha tea is equivalent to ten cups of green tea, so the health rewards are astronomical!

review/summary: Vanilla is the one for me.
review/text: So now that I've caved into a growing adoration of matcha, I gave myself permission to cave to the siren's call of Red Leaf Teas. My wife already adores them for their Earls, and Tea Equals Bliss on Steepster has nothing but good things to say about their matchas, so it was an easy next step to take. And the Madagascar Vanilla Matcha was an absolute must for me.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the matcha. I'm in love, y'all. My wife asked how it was, and I could only put the mug down long enough to say "Oh my gawd...." Geez, I'm starting to sound like a Paula Dean special. There was no butter added to this tea, y'all, I promise. You all know how much I love vanilla, it's my chocolate, to be perfectly honest. Especially French Vanilla....mmm. Anyway, this has a creaminess that reminds me of a good French Vanilla, but without being overwhelmingly sweet like some French Vanilla teas can be. The greenness of the matcha isn't lost in the flavoring, it's a very nice balance. It doesn't taste artificial, it just tastes delicious and creamy and smooth and everything I ever wanted in a vanilla matcha. This is definitely one I plan to stock up on, once I've tried all of the ones I want to try! Next on my to buy list is cinnamon, and I'm already dreaming about mixing the cinnamon with the vanilla and drifting off into a delicious, delicious sunset! While full of excess energy, of course! Oooh, and mint for homemade, dairy-free Shamrock shakes! Mmmm....I see a lot of possibilities with this little beauty. Anywhere you need touch of creaminess, this matcha is there! Oh man, remember the blueberry pie I made with Vanilla Oolong? It would be out of this world with this matcha. And make it healthy! Well...healthy-ish.<br /><br />This matcha inspires me to bake and blend my own flavors and just go crazy with matcha. I used to only drink matcha occasionally, but I think this particular tea might lead me down the road of "My Morning Matcha". There are too many possiblities! Blueberries and Cream matcha, Shamrock Shakes, Dreamscicle matcha...do you see where I'm going with this? And the baking ideas are just as endless. Matcha butter cookies....oh hey, y'all! Lookie there, there is butter in this review. Dang.  I guess I am Paula Dean. I promise I will never deep fry matcha.

review/summary: beautiful sparkles
review/text: I loved this product.. I crushed up a bunch between my fingers and put it in my homemade buttercream frosting and they came out beautiful! I took a star away because you have to use a lot to get it to show because if you just sprinkle it on top they look like flakes and not sparkles even when you crush them.

review/summary: High quality budget tea
review/text: I drink a lot of tea and felt that I had to comment given that only 1 review was posted for this product.  Lipton tea is probably the largest selling tea brand in the world. It is renown for its quality in the budget price range.  It is not a "specialty" tea but represents very good value - far surpassing the average store brand.  It will brew a strong distinctly red colored tea.<br />Having said all of this, the price listed here is quite high...

review/text: I love this sauce. My favorite use is over grilled salmon. Try this: bed of greens (arugula or spinach are good), 1-1/2 oz feta cheese, about 1/2 c FRESH pineapple (can throw in some raspberries in-season),  8 roasted almonds, juice of half a lime and about 2 t good olive oil. Top with the grilled salmon (about 6 oz piece)which has been doused with a couple of tablespoons of the raspberry-chipotle sauce. Yum...about 14 points on the WW system but very low fat, high nutrition, lots of volume and tastes GREAT.

review/summary: Fine Camomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Calm Herbal Infusion is a nice chamomile tea. I taste the chamomile and some flavorings, and they are not unpleasant, just hard to pin down as to what they are besides the chamomile. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />The ingredients in Calm are: chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice and natural flavors. It is caffeine-free.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a soothing blend of chamomile blossoms and other relaxing herbs." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Calm as "creamy, floral, minty, toasty, sweet, honey-like. As the name gently implies, Tazo Calm has a lovely floral bouquet with an apple-like flavor and distinct toasty notes. Naturally sweet in a nice light way, with a smooth finish". Tazo describes the aroma as "minty, hay like, rose". I don't taste all of these various flavors, but I do taste the chamomile, and it is fine, not overwhelming or as artificial tasting as several of the other Tazo teas I've sampled.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as other tea companies that feature only natural flavorings like Numi, which is why Tazo Calm gets only four stars.<br />****

review/summary: Lovely nutty & sweet snack!
review/text: The milk chocolate chunks in this product are heavenly.  The reason for the 3-star rating, whereas my other reviews of the Al Wadi halvas are higher, is primarily because of the inconsistency in the quality of the product from tub to tub in the same case, in the same shipment.  The first one I opened was amazing.  There were enormous globs of those wonderful chocolate chunks and the halva was soft, and resembled chocolate chip cookie dough in texture with this sweet, nutty taste that was to-die-for.  The next tub I opened was quite dry and although it had some good chunks in it, I found that I was basically digging out the chocolate and avoiding the halva, which was hard, dry and nearly tasteless.  The remaining tubs followed this trend.  I compared the halva in this product (just the halva) to the plain Al Wadi halva and it didn't taste nearly as good; it was also harder and drier and more compacted.  If I were rating on the halva alone in this particular iteration, I would have to give it 1 or 2 stars, but the stellar chocolate pieces really deserve some credit, so I settled on an overall rating of 3 stars.  I don't think that this type has as much benefit for breastfeeding mothers as the plain or pistachio types because of the large amount of chocolate which has been introduced to the product, and the benefit comes in the halawa extract which is in the halva and not the chocolate.  If you're looking to increase your breast milk production, get the plain or pistachio; however, I think the American palette would be more receptive to this, the halva with chocolate, IMHO.  Get some gas relief pills if you're going to be snacking on halva constantly for breast milk production (take it from me and save yourself the pain)!

review/summary: Great for Puppies!
review/text: Better than other joint health treats I've tried, the Sea Mobility treats are the best I've found yet for my 5 month-old Australian Labradoodle puppy. They really aren't expensive for how much you get, and they have only a few high-quality ingredients (pretty much just meat and supplements). What's best of all, dogs really love them and the jerky is pre-scored to tear into training-sized bits. One strip lasts me 2-3 days on average, which I use as high-value reward for extra-good behavior.<br /><br />I'm recommending these treats to everyone else I know with large-breed puppies. They really do help with growing pain issues and will hopefully set them up for many years of healthy joints.

review/summary: Good product for old dogs
review/text: My dog, Luke is a 16 y/o shepherd mix who has been eating these treats for years. Can't say for sure if this has helped his longevity, but it certainly hasn't hurt . He loves them and has always been a hard one to take pills. We walked twice a day up until 2 mths ago. So if you are looking for glucosanimine (?sp) for your dog, certainly something to try that isn't a pill.

review/summary: my dog loves them
review/text: I will continue purchasing these treats as they are a good source of chondroitin.  My chin eats them readily and looks forward to his daily dosage. Looking forward to the restocking of the venison jerky as I plan on purchasing them also.  Great buy for the money, elsewhere you would only get one package for the same price that Amazon gives you two.

review/summary: Sea Jerky
review/text: I have been using Sea Jerky for my dog for a few years.  But was only able to find Beef and Chicken Flavor.  Was happy to find the Lamb flavor.  My dog totally enjoys it.  And she is a fussy eater.  So would recommend this to anyone who has a dog with arthritis.

review/summary: Really great grains
review/text: It is wonderful to be able to measure out the one cup of quinoa and add the 2 cups of half chicken broth and half filtered water that I use to cook it and NOT have to spend extra minutes rinsing and draining it!<br /><br />It cooks perfectly in exactly 15 minutes as per instructions on the bag.  Since we no longer eat wheat in any form - and get a bit tired of rice all the time - we really enjoy the quinoa as a delicious substitute for couscous or orzo.  It makes delicious tabbouleh and is also really good as a warm side dish, with or without the extra things like mushrooms that one would use in a pilaf.<br /><br />I shared the second 5# bag with two friends and they are enjoying it also.

review/summary: Roland Quinoa, Prewashed
review/text: I like prewashed quinoa the best because there is no waste from draining those tiny little seeds and there is no trace of bitterness.  So convenient!  I am a vegan and Roland prewashed quinoa gives me the required daily amount of protein.  Amazon.com makes it easy with super saver shipping delivered right to my door.<br />Attention Vegetarians: prepare a large batch of Roland Quinoa and keep in the refrigerator for a quick base for your sauteed vegetable dishes. Also great as a hot cereal!

review/summary: pre-washed quinoa
review/text: Living in such a remote area mandates that I order many of my favorite foods online.  I chose Roland Quinoa because of the two, individually sealed bags that are both resealable.  I also was intrigued that this quinoa is pre-washed and I have not been disappointed in the least!  Now my meals are easier to prepare because I am eliminating the pre-washing step; the quality of this quinoa is superior and I will be ordering this brand from Amazon.com again!

review/summary: love it!
review/text: As a physician in holistic health care I'm always looking for healthy options.  After doing much research and having patients teach me about quinoa I decided to try it.  It's a great substitute for rice or brown rice and has much more health benefit. Generally quinoa needs to be washed.  The beauty of this product is NO WASHING required!  It takes about 15 minutes to make and is very easy.  No pan or product burning issues.  I make it in bulk so I have it already done for the week and add it to what ever I'm making.  I'm on regular delivery and it couldn't be any easier!!

review/summary: Misleading Picture and Description
review/text: This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is "russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA".  Notice that this product title starts with "Alaskan Salmon", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of "Grained Salmon Caviar"  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see "made in USA" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was "sorry I was out of town".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.  However there are still inconsistencies with this product's page, that needs to be pointed out.
