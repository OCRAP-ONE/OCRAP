review/summary: Creamy deliciousness!
review/text: I have had European chocolate in the past and really wanted to get some. This spreadable chocolate is better than any other milk chocolate I have had in a long time. It is creamy, spreads well on just about anything (pretzels, bananas, combined with peanut butter), and tastes like quality chocolate. I would order this again in a heart beat!. It is just too bad it isn't made/sold here in the States.

review/summary: "Chocolate in a Jar! Oh My ~ Heavenly"
review/text: My sister-in-law brought me a jar of this smooth, creamy,  delicately sweet chocolate spread on her recent visit from the UK.<br /><br />Cadbury's spreads like butter, the other leading chocolate/hazelnut spread  can tend to be a little thick and tear the bread and I am not a fan of the hazelnut; I'd rather have the pure chocolate.<br /><br />Chocolate does not get much purer than Cadbury.<br /><br />One of my favorites is as a late night snack is made up of a wheat sandwich thin, one side with peanut butter the other side with Cadbury's.  Yum.<br /><br />For me it is worth the price; we have a British shop 30 miles in the next town over.  It was $10.70 there and I burned 2 gallons gas in the trip to pick it up.<br /><br />It is a luxurious treat.  Hide it from the kids :-)

If you like candy cane lane I would say you would also like this.  The primary difference is that candy cane lane is a little sweeter naturally or this tea is a little more minty, but I do not add sugar or cream to my tea so I can not speak for difference if you use extras.  Overall I have been very pleased and will buy this again when I am out!

review/summary: 1/3 of the cans were too dented to use--this product does not ship well at all!
review/text: My dog eats Merrick food, and I thought it would be more convenient to start ordering it from Amazon in cases instead of hauling it home from the pet store every few days. Plus, it's a couple of dollars cheaper to buy it here versus at my neighborhood store. Unfortunately, though, the case of cans didn't survive shipping well at all--of the 12 cans, 4 were so severely dented that I don't think it's safe to feed their contents to my dog. I'm not talking about a little indentation at the rim, either--they were totally crunched and bent, completely trashed. I have no idea whether this was because the cans were too delicate, whether the Amazon box wasn't properly cushioned, or whether the package was abused in shipping, but I have noticed that even when I buy this brand at the pet store, I have to check really carefully to make sure that the cans are in good condition. Whatever the reason, this shouldn't happen, especially for a pricey brand like this--when cans get dented, it can let in air and bacteria that can spoil the food and make your dog sick. Given that 1/3 of what I bought was unusable, I ended up paying roughly $28 for 8 cans of dog food. That's way, way more expensive than supporting my local pet store. If these cans don't survive transport very well, it makes a lot more sense to me to buy them locally, when I can avoid the bad cans.<br /><br />Shipping headaches aside, however, I do recommend the food itself. My dog is a picky eater, but she seems to enjoy Merrick products well enough. They are made of high quality ingredients, and even though she has a sensitive stomach, they don't give her any trouble. I just wish that they'd pack the stuff in a container that could survive the transport to my house!

review/text: I read reviews at great length before I ordered this product.  I was so excited by the great reviews..I couldn't wait for it to arrive so I could give it to my finicky eater...assuming she'd just gobble it down.  But no...she sniffed at it and walked away!  To me, the product looks and smells delicious!  I've opened and offered the food 4 or 5 times...and occasionally my stubborn viszla will eat a LITTLE...just to appease me I'm sure.<br />So I'm writing this review so those of you who have really finicky dogs won't get TOO excited about this food.  Not ALL dogs are wild over it!  Mine isn't... If I ever run out of food, however, I'll probably try it myself! hahaha...

review/text: These are by far my absolute favorite crouton.  Like the PP above said, they are pretty orange in color but the cheese flavor is by far more flavorful than other cheese flavored croutons on the market.  They may look like cheetos in color but they are far from tasting like them.  They are small enough to get a few on each forkful but flavorful enough that you don't need to dump them all over your salad.  I usually like a larger crouton but once trying these smaller ones, I don't think I will ever go back.  My kids like to eat them right out of the package like crackers.  They really are that good.

I even tried it on salads and in foods but couldn't eat it.  The mulberies didn't agree with me either.  Too expensive for the taste to be off like that.  I'll just go for the plain Gojis next time.

Such a wonderful cup of coffee. I usually like mine with cream and sugar and with this cup I didn't need either. Try it black with a small amount of sugar. Excellent. Someone suggested cutting this coffee with Kona. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This coffee doesn't need to be cut by anything. It stands up on its own and if your friends didn't notice any difference in the coffee they were driking you either a) made it wrong, or b) have friends with little to no taste buds.

There are some barbarians in my local area who believe that extreme dark roast is popular, so they do this ultra scorch job on Jamaican Blue Mountain.

review/text: Purhcased this for Christmas Dinner and shared with family. No rave reviews from anyone. Usually everyone enjoys our coffee but no one, not a one, commented on this brew (which isn't a good thing). We ground the beans right before roasting, tried a few different racios and realized that you need an extra amount of coffee per cup to give it flavor. Flavor is what we're after as coffee people but, this fell short of the rave reviews on Amazon. We never told anyone at Christmas Dinner about the coffee so we would get a "clean" report. Got nothing back and that's not good. For ourselves, we didn't find anything but flatness in this. It might be good to cut this with Kona. We're going to try that out. This is far too expensive to throw out so we have to find a way to enjoy it. We have used other Blue Mountain coffees and love it.  We do NOT recommend this particular coffee.

When he woke up, I had to go back home, but I sent him a care package for when he got home. This was in there. Not only was he amazed I remembered this was his favorite, but he was amazed that it tasted as good as he remembered it! He had a heart attack a few months later and died, but I'm grateful I was able to remind him of one more good memory before he passed. I wasn't able to try it, but my mom still raves at how great it was, and how much my dad liked it.

You see, JBM is so subtle, so complex, that a new tounge will not notice what makes JBM quite so wonderful.<br /><br />It is a "perfectly" blended coffee. Flavor, bitterness, acidity and aftertaste. On a scale of one to ten, they all rank dead even at five.

At $50 per pound, what you're tasting is justification for spending the money. What you should do, if you have the money for this sort of coffee, is buy a coffee roaster and start getting good green beans (including Jamaican Blue Mountain) and roasting them fresh yourself.

I'm very careful about dog food and treats because more and more seem to be coming from China.  My final rule is -- would I eat something from that country myself?  I would/do eat from Thailand, so in this case it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />This particular supplier:  Please, please, PLEASE be careful when you purchase.  They show a full sized can but IT IS NOT!  These are very, very small 2.8 cans.

I have the pickiest dog so I figured I would take home a can just to try it out on her...She doesnt eat 3/4 of anything I bring home in the way of food or treats so I didnt think it had a chance.  well when I opened the can I couldnt believe what I saw.  It looked like I opened a meal for me.  It looked homemade.  There were chunks of meat, potatoes and vegetables.  There was no "doggy" smell either.  It smelled fresh and delicious, believe it or not.  I could not believe this was holistic special food.  Well I put it down for my baby girl to try and she gobbled it up in no time at all.  It passed her inspection so it has to be good!  I will be buying all the flavors for her from now on.  No more picky eating at dinner...Im thrilled!

review/text: I have been trying out different crackers and pretzels to fulfill my need for something nonsweet and crunchy that isn't too bad for me.  I think Manischewitz has a real shot at the non-bube market. Even though there is no salt added, these whole wheat matzos aren't tasteless.  I think they would sell more boxes to outsiders if they shrank the image of the crackers on the box and included a simple hummus recipe on the back of the box as a serving suggestion.  It couldn't hurt.

review/summary: Great Matzos
review/text: Whole wheat matzos are hard to find in my locality, but I prefer the nutritional value and whole wheat taste of them over those made with white flour. These are plain matzos with no salt added. That gives them diminished salty taste but more flexibility.<br />To use with meals or salads, I brush one side of them with salad dressing (I use Italian), place them brushed side up on a cookie sheet and set in a preheated 350 degree oven for five minutes. This makes them crunchy and tasty. For a special sweet treat, I use one of the chocolate or toffee recipes found on the Martha Stewart website. These treats have become a highly requested item on certain special occasions.<br />I also like to carefully melt cheese over them in the microwave to create a sort of pizza effect.<br />The boxes did not ship well and most were received with the tops broken open. The matzoth nonetheless arrived sealed in plastic, whole, fresh and intact.

review/summary: A Nice Easy Morning Kick
review/text: I did a lot of research on Yerba Mate', and I strongly suggest you do the same.  There seems to be a big dispute over whether Yerba Mate' contains caffeine or not.  You will see some references about it containing as much caffeine as coffee, and then you will find references saying it has no caffeine at all, and then you will find yet more references that it contains a different form (isotope) of caffeine.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the case actually is concerning caffeine at this point.<br /><br />I decided to find out for myself and bought several different types of Yerba Mate' teas, ranging from very cheap to very expensive.<br /><br />The way it works may be different for everyone, but Yerba Mate' definitely has a caffeine-like effect on me, but it doesn't make me jittery like caffeine usually does.  It gives me a very mellow, yet very awake, feeling after about two cups.<br /><br />Now, how about the taste?  Well, you will see some reviews that talk about Yerba Mate' tasting something like boiled hay/grass... this is true for most of the Yerba Mate' teas that I bought.  The Wisdom Of The Ancients Yerba Mate' Royale Chai Spice is an exception to this.  This chai flavored Yerba Mate' has a wonderful flavor and is very enjoyable.  This is one of the less expensive brands, but it is the best tasting I have found.  I have several people from my office now ordering it (or at least stealing some of mine on a regular basis).<br /><br />Wisdom Of The Ancients Yerba Mate Royale Chai Spice also contains stevia, so it is probably already sweet enough for most people without adding anything to it (though I do add some Splenda and creamer).<br /><br />One last important note: let the tea bags steep much longer than you would let regular tea steep, and never boil the tea bags!  Boiling Yerba Mate' makes it taste like something you scraped off the bottom of your lawnmower.  I usually let it steep for 10-15 minutes in very hot water, which would make regualr tea too bitter to drink, but Yerba Mate' does not get bitter with over-steeping.<br /><br />As cheap as this brand is, grab a box and try it for yourself, and chances are you'll have a very enjoyable experience.

review/summary: Best peppermint tea I know of
review/text: This is the tastiest Peppermint tea I know of. The tea bags are well made, the amount of tea is substantial, well packed. The taste is the best I've had. I have a cup of peppermint tea many evenings, and there is no caffeine in this tea to keep me awake. My recent favorite peppermint tea was the "Safeway" brand, but this has a better fuller taste. Most of the other brands I've tried were dissapointing.

review/summary: Best commercial peppermint tea
review/text: I once had some dried mint from Greece, brought over by Greek friends, that was even more delicious and naturally sweet, but for a packaged tea, this is definitely the best.  I wish they hadn't changed their brand name from Pompadour to TeeKanne, but the tea still tastes the same.<br /><br />Their fennel flavor is also delicious, for those who like a licorice/anise sort of flavor.  The other flavors don't do much for me (I've tried them all).  But this peppermint tea is always a treat.

If your used to over salty products of this kind these clams might take a little getting used to, season and add salt to your own tastes. More companys should let the consumer add salt or sugar to a product after purchse.

In comparison to fresh mussels for 2.64 a pound from Costco meat department and fresh clams for 3.49 a pound this product is waste of money since it is not tasty at all and comes in small smashed pieces... At Costco, the fresh shell fish is raised in Washington by Toronto Canada area and it is fresh, tastes great with all the nutritional values... I use the shells as calcium for my plants and the meat tastes great, the way a good shell fish should taste from cold Pacific waters...

However, of the 12 cans in this order, 4 arrived damaged - bent -  and I'm not sure if that has a significant effect on safety or not.

They came "iced" over like they had been in the freezer forever. The taste of each indvidual food was very bland. My 2 year old wouldn't touch them. For the price I paid, the food should look attractive and taste good. I don't think I would have been too disappointed had the price point been a little lower. The pictures on the boxes look 10x better than the actual food itself. I will not purchase from them again. And, I was so excited! Maybe my expectations were too high?

review/summary: Excellent Horseradish Flavored Condiment
review/text: Note that this product is labeled "Horseradish Sauce" versus prepared horseradish. As Gioacco's review noted, Horseradish is the third ingredient, so this should not be confused with prepared horseradish which would include horseradish as the first ingredient. The actual flavor and texture is like horseradish flavored mayonnaise with added flavors. Egg yolks are listed in the ingredients. Definitely include this condiment however with Ketchup, Mustard, Relish and Mayonnaise for barbecue, sandwich making and tabletop use. For finer beef steak preparation I would recommend prepared horseradish although this product could be a reasonable stand-in. Excellent product and I plan to order another 6-pack when available through Amazon Subscribe & Save again. Saves me about 40% compared to buying locally. Aloha,  John

review/summary: Best Grain-Free for the Money
review/text: I have been feeding TOTW to my Italian Greyhound-Terrier mix for over a year now and I have nothing but good things to say about it. First, for all of those wanting to feed their dog grain-free, but struggling to pay Orijen prices, TOTW is the solution. TOTW is definitely the most cost-effective grain-free food I've been able to find.<br /><br />For all of those fearful of the use of fish meal and the possible threat of ethoxyquin, it appears that TOTW customer service have confirmed that the particular ocean fish meal used in TOTW is, in fact, ethoxyquin-free. Here is the link to that information and a step-by-step analysis of the ingredient list.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />After getting my dog from a rescue, feeding him TOTW has helped him reach a healthy weight and an active lifestyle. The vet has repeatedly noted how good his weight is, how great his coat looks and how well muscled he is.<br /><br />TOTW, with its high protein and fat content (fat is an essential part of a healthy diet for our four-legged friends) is a great, cost-effective grain-free option. However, those switching from grain kibbles need to be slow about switching their dogs to this kibble. TOTW and other grain-free foods are much richer and a 5 to 7 days slow transition will yield the best result.<br /><br />Is TOTW for every dog? Probably not, every dog reacts differently to different food and if you have a small breed, I would tend to focus on the lower protein content of the Pacific Stream formula rather than the High Prairie or Wetlands Formulas. I do, however, think TOTW can be a great option for a lot of dog owners. If you're interested in starting to feed grain-free and holistic dog food, TOTW has worked great for me and my dog.

review/text: We usually feed our dog the High Prairie version of Taste of the Wild but we sometime like to buy a bag of a different version of TOTW (Wetlands or Pacific Stream) to provide him with some variety. Whenever we change foods we are sure to mix the two formulas for a few days to avoid an upset stomach, and while this works with the Wetlands version it has not with the Pacific Stream food which doesn't seem to agree with our dog too well.  He loves the flavor, but when we give him the Pacific Stream formula we notice that he tends to have bad breath with strong hints of fish and that he to get loose stools.<br /><br />While we think that Taste of the Wild is outstanding food, the Pacific Stream formula is not for us and we will stick with their High Plains version with the occasional bag of Wild Fowl to mix it up.

review/text: ***For the person with 1 star It states quite clearly on their site FAQ:<br />DOES THIS FOOD CONTAIN ETHOXYQUIN?<br />Taste of the Wild Pet Foods sources all protein meals (chicken meal, fish meal, etc) from vendors that do not use ethoxyquin. As always, only natural preservatives are used in our manufacturing process to preserve the foods.<br /><br />So why someone would review this and give it 1 star is beyond me! I started to use this after my smooth coat chihuahua Herbie seemed a little sickly. I didnt realize soy and grain is not a good thing for our animals. I previously used Royal Canin.  He's full of energy and his coat is darker and shiny! We also augment his food with the Tast Of The Wild Wetlands food and he loves that also.  The high protein content means the animal will be less hungry and consume less food in the long run.  Think about it if you eat chicken or steak your less hungry than if you ate a bunch of rice because carbs get burned quickly. BUY this food your doggy will thank you for it!

review/summary: Still Too Much Fat, But Less Than Some Flavors...
review/text: Tried this, recently, (in all dry flavors) for my German Shepherd Dog. At first, he wouldn't touch it, but after about a week, he decided he absolutely loves it. The biggest problem is within the first month, he had gained 3 pounds, even though he was eating less than the recommended amount and less than he was previously used to eating. Also, he had soft, oily looking stools while eating this. He is an active, very healthy, well-exercised, older dog. He did seem to be more "chipper" and health-wise, he seemed to do fine, except for the softer stools and weight gain, but reluctantly, we had to stop feeding this, exclusively, as we were feeding less and less and he was still gaining weight AND seemed hungry all the time, looking for any other food to eat. Since he loves the taste so much, we have decided to give him only a cup or so a day, in his Kong, with his other food or as training treats and have switched him to another food. I'm not sure I agree with the "good for all life stages" philosophy either. In the old days, that was what one did, but now that we know much more about nutrition, I believe that different life stages do require different nutrient levels. Much as humans do. Sadly, for our dog, this can not be the only food he eats, but it will remain a part of his daily diet, since he loves it and did well, except for the fat content. Hope this helps!

review/summary: I love this food
review/text: I have shih tzu's (a few to be exact) and I have to say this is the best food I have ever fed them.  I only purchase the pacific stream because it has 25% protien vs 32% that a couple of the other formula's have.  One other one also has 25% protien which is a good amount for small dogs.  Anyways...I had one girl that seemed itchy and would get hot spots periodically.  After switching to this food the itchyness is completely gone and no hotspots since. They have nice firm poops and I really can't say enough about it. They are all used to high end dog food as I have in the past fed Innova, canidae and was feeding blue buffalo...all of which were good dog foods and for the most part worked really well.  I have always been a fan of grain free food, but most has too high of protien for tiny dogs. Hi quality and certain meat or fish products keep the protien levels in check for small dogs that do not need the high amounts (work dogs and bigger dogs it is fine)...I was so excited to find a grain free food with perfect protien levels (IMO)and it has been wonderful. It is definately a 5* rating in my book.

I thought I was giving her the best, it looked fresh and rich, but it turns out it was just absolutely terrible food.  My black Lab also had terrible skin allergies, to the point where I would get a small rash on my skin if he laid next to me on the couch for more than 5 minutes at a time.  I had no clue it was because of the food.  But it was!<br /><br />Since having that epiphany and learning so much about dog food, I've always made sure to feed them the highest quality grain free food I can buy.  This Taste of the Wild (TOTW) fits the bill very nicely, and they love it.  Since switching to a grain free diet, the yellow lab has not had any more seizures in over a year, and the black lab has the silkiest coat you've ever seen and his skin allergies are completely gone.<br /><br />They are on 2/3rds dry and 1/3rd wet combination.  Contrary to what I had previously been raised to believe, a wet diet is not bad for dogs but in fact is superior!  I use the combination to save money while providing them the best I can.<br /><br />Before deciding on TOTW, I had also tried Blue Buffalo, Wellness Core, and Orijen.  Briefly: they are all good foods, but my labs were happiest on TOTW and my wallet is also happiest on TOTW.  I also believe TOTW has a better formulation for them and their life style (some of the products, like Orijen, are simply too rich for the average household dog, despite being made of the best ingredients available).<br /><br />Enter TOTW.  The dry food is dark and rich, with no sign of crumbling.  The kibble is a good average size.  The wet food has nice chunks of meat and the right amount of gravy.  I use the wet food as a topper to mix the 2/3rd dry and 1/3rd wet together for their meals.  I use one whole can of wet per meal with my pack, which is convinient so I don't have to store it in the refrigerator - btw, never store canned dog food in the fridge in the original aluminum container!<br /><br />I still wish I could find a less expensive product with the same quality, but in the mean time, TOTW is the best choice for my pack.

review/summary: Food production plant has a lot of issues & my dog is sick
review/text: One of the three plants that makes Taste of the Wild in South Carolina has had some quality control issues. Two other brands made at the plant have been recalled for Salmonella. My dog happens to be very sick with Salmonella symptoms. I spent over $800 at the vet and he almost died.  Is it a coincidence that there is a Salmonella issue at the plant and my dog is very ill with similar symptoms? I'm not sure, but I don't trust them anymore.

review/summary: Bulldog Heaven
review/text: This is absolutely the best dog food I've ever used. We have both a Boxer and an English Bulldog. Before this food, they both had sensitive stomachs and even more sensitive, acne prone skin. Now they poo only twice a day. They shed less, their coats and skin are both flawless. Honestly!!!!  I absolutely cannot tell you how much of a positive change we've realized since finding Taste of the Wild Salmon formula.

review/summary: Beware:  Gulf of Mexico products (oil spill & chemical concern) in this food.
review/text: I loved the idea of this product until I saw the film "The Big Fix" and learned that the fish from the Gulf of Mexico is probably not actually safe to eat (despite what our government wants us to believe).<br /><br />The 2nd ingredient in this food (which I've been feeding my beloved pets) is "ocean fish meal."  I wrote and phoned Diamond Pet Foods (maker of Taste of the Wild) and confirmed that their "ocean fish meal" indeed comes from the Gulf of Mexico.  I then did my own research and confirmed online that today (April 2012) there are major concerns with the fish and seafood coming from the gulf.  Fish are showing up with black and bright red 'lesions' and crustaceans are showing up with blackened body parts.  This was in some video taken by a journalist and posted on the web.<br /><br />If you watch The Big Fix you'll learn not only about the oil that is likely sitting on the bottom of the gulf, but you'll also learn about toxic chemical dispersant branded as COREXIT, which has been used extensively in the gulf to hide the oil.  This is what's REALLY going on with the fish in the gulf and you can probably assume that pet food is considered a great way to "dispose" of food products within the commerce chain.<br /><br />I'm stopping feeding my pet this food immediately because despite what the bag depicts (wolves and bears in the wild) one of the major ingredients ("ocean fish meal") doesn't come from the pacific northwest at all, but actually comes from the gulf of Mexico which is a suspect source of food for both humans and pets according to the alternative press.<br /><br />For reference check out the following articles.  Amazon won't let me post links so you must google these as key words:<br /><br />1.  Lauran Neergaard's 4/25/12 gruesome photo for AP of fish in a Gainsburg FL paper.  She's a medical writer.<br />2.  Amy Goodman's Due Diligence On Gulf Oil Spill 4/24/12<br />3.  4/23/12 Crustacean biologist Darryl Felder of University of Louisana reports "finding crab and lobster, etc., that had black gills, that had appendages falling off" plus "parasites and other illnesses" setting in.<br />4.  "Gulf Aquatic Wildlife Deformities Alarm Scientists" 4/21/12, Dr. Jim Cowan of Louisiana State University<br />5.  Same article as #4:  Dr Wilma Subra, a chemist and Macarthur Fellow, has conducted tests on seafood and sediment samples along the Gulf for chemicals present in BP's crude oil and toxic dispersants.<br /><br />"Tests have shown significant levels of oil pollution in oysters and crabs along the Louisiana coastline," per Subra.
