review/summary: Very sweet and watered down
review/text: Out of all the chai tea pre-mixes I have tried, this is by far the worst in my opinion. The mixture is very watered down and just sugary tasting. The taste of the spices is not there. I tried adding ingredients and making it drinkable, but there was no fixing it. I threw it away.

review/summary: Balanced Taste/Oregon Chai Tea
review/text: After trying various Chai Teas at the multiple coffee shops Starbucks, Tully's and several drive thru espresso stops - Oregon Chai has the best balance of flavors. This concentrate provides first the aroma/taste of tea then the tantalzing spice blends and thankfully the sweetness does not dominante the overall flavor. For my 'personal tastes' I find Tzao a bit overwhelming in the spices causing this to overpower any taste of tea (which is vague at best), sweetness is less than the Oregon Chai Tea but this obviously will suit those who don't care for sweeten tea.  Amazon offers a six pack at a very reasonable price for those of us who don't want to go back n' forth to the grocery store every few days.  I found that larger grocery stores offer both products in the coffee / tea aisle, or in the organic section.  I love espresso and lattes but do try hot or cold Chai Tea - it's a great first or even second choice during the day!

review/summary: Difficult to drink
review/text: I know this is totally a personal taste thing, but I simply cannot stand this stuff. The flavour of the spices and tea is extremely weak, I can barely make anything out past a very vague bit of tea taste. And to boot, it's disgustingly sweet (and I have a sweet tooth: I like pops, fruit juices, etc.). The drink leaves a terrible thick sensation in my mouth and an aftertaste that doesn't soon go away, and becomes difficult to even swallow after a few sips. The feeling in my mouth and throat after consuming a glass of it was not a good one in any way.<br /><br />I prepared it to instructions and included exactly the suggested amount of milk, and I tried again with the same result. It's not user error.

review/summary: Bowl of Enlightenment
review/text: Seeds of Change is a Santa Fe, New Mexico-based health foods company. Surprisingly, they specialize in Asian cuisine such as tikka masala and jalfrezi sauces, as well as basmati and jasmine rices. Then again, Santa Fe has such a huge number of Buddhists, and one of the highest number of Tibetan refugees outside of India.<br /><br />Dharamsala Indian Rice is a delicious blend. It manages to redeem garbanzo beans, just as the lotus rises out of the mud. There are garbanzos, lentils and mung beans, blended with fragrant basmati rice. The spice blend is piquant and sweet. While it's meant for savory dishes, it tastes almost like a component for rice pudding. It's that sweet. I've combined it with macaroni and tomato sauce to make an Egyptian street food dish from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0836192648">Extending the Table: A World Community Cookbook</a>. It's delicious and nutritious!

review/text: I began ordering these using the "Subscribe and Save" program while we were posted overseas, and now that we are back in the States, I will probably continue to buy from Amazon.  The price is way better than any grocery store around, and the only place that can compete is Wal-Mart, which is a bit of hike (not literally!) for me.  My son loves this cereal and it mysteriously disappears much more rapidly on the weekends, when my husband eats his breakfast at home.  Although there are healthier cereals out there, I am happy that this one is made with whole grains and has a relatively low sugar content, especially compared to the sugary cereals available overseas (believe it or not, more so than in the US).  Thanks Amazon for carrying this product!

It's understandable that different flavors keep coming out and if a supermarket is to carry every flavor of Cheerios it would have to dedicate entire isle for all varieties of the brand!<br /><br />Luckily Amazon carries it and price is reasonable. 5 stars for both the cereal itself for the Yogurt Burst lovers and Amazon.

review/summary: BEST brown rice at a fantastic price!
review/text: I picked up a bag of this rice at the Baton Rouge farmers market a couple of years ago while on vacation. Tried it, was instantly addicted. This is not only the best tasting brown rice our family has ever tried, it is one of the most "stable" shelf-wise as well.<br /><br />This is the only rice I use now unless a recipe specifices something specific.  I've found it tastes great regardless of whether it is being served with Cajun, Oriental, Italian, or any other type of ethinc recipes.<br /><br />I cannot imagine anyone not liking this rice...wish it were sold in national grocery chains for convenience sake. We always have a bag in the frig and multiple in the freezer.<br /><br />Side note that doesn't affect rating:  Like the old packaging better as the clear bags let you admire the beautiful grains.  Also felt more like a farm to table kind of package.  This new package is to sterile/modern or something for my taste.

The sweetness is just right - not overly sweet like mainstream corn syrup sweetened granolas.<br /><br />A slight on the chewy side for a "crunchy" granola, but not to where it's bothersome - just takes a little more masticating than some other granolas.

A little goes a long way, as it is very filling.<br />I love eating it with cold milk for breakfast! I would also recommend keeping it in the freezer, it stays fresher much longer...and can be eaten right out of the freezer without a 'hardness' worry.<br />Recommended.

However, I find that there is just enough coconut and sesame to make this a perfect breakfast/snack granola.

review/text: I bought 4 18oz packs of this granola and was extremely disappointed.  I had used Red Mill stuff before and liked it so tried this.  It is under-toasted so it tastes like paste... like raw oatmeal.  If you want bland, tasteless granola be sure to buy this.<br /><br />Avoid this stuff!

review/summary: A+ Tea
review/text: Numi has done it again.  This is just a fantastic tea.  Normally I do not like anything with Jasmine in it as I find it overpowering but Numi is an exception.  I really enjoyed this tea and the combination of magnolia and jasmine was just right so nothing was too strong.  I also like the fact that it is low in sugar, carbs, and calories.  One 12oz bottle has 45 calories, 12g carbs, and 11g sugar.  Compare that to most other bottled teas on the market today and that is pretty low.  There isn't a 'fake' sugar flavor or aftertaste as it's sweetened with organic honey, agave, and evaporated cane juice.  Plus, on the label it's stamped 'USDA organic', 'certified organic by QAI', 'Kosher & Pareve', and 'Halal'.  It's a fantastic natural product.  I didn't order through Amazon though - I got it directly from the Numi website, but I wanted to leave a review here for others.

review/summary: Great Stuff - but formula has since changed
review/text: I first bought this lime extract to flavor "home-made" seltzer water without the use of sugar or real lime juice in July of 2009. This extract has been very easy to use - about 6cc per liter of seltzer. I've gotten lots of compliments on the taste of the lime-infused seltzer and I'm no longer throwing out perfectly good bottles after just one use.<br /><br />The shipment from JR Mushrooms was prompt... two bottles arrived in a well-padded box with lots of bubble-wrap and foam peanuts to keep them safe and sound. The bottles themselves are dark brown glass (presumably to shield the juice from the sun) and have well-fitting plastics caps. All in all, I was very happy with this purchase and the quality of the product, as of July 2009.<br /><br />Recently (August 2010 - that is how long the initial 32 oz order of the old extract lasted), I ordered another set of extract. Sadly, the supplier of extract to JRMushroom has changed and so has the formulation - the extract now arrives in a clear plastic bottle, not the dark brown glass bottle of 2009. I am not convinced that the present version if terpeneless, as there is a fairly bitter aftertaste. Amit at OliveNation/JRMushrooms was very nice to refund the unopened bottle (I had bought 2) and also informed me that he is negotiating a new supplier for the stuff.<br /><br />So here is what I suggest for any extract order over the internet: Order a small sample bottle ($6.5) and make sure it fits your flavor expectations before ordering a larger bottle. Plus, before you re-order, contact the seller and make sure that the flavor/supplier hasn't changed. I am a bit disappointed that Amit has not updated the Amazon web pages to reflect the new packaging, which would have been a good clue not to go ahead with a large-bottle purchase but to sample the present product first. Live and learn, I guess.

review/text: My 3 1/2 year old Lhasa Apso is doing well (hard stools), when he is on this dog kibble.  He limits his eating, so even though we leave the kibble down all day, he will not devour all the kibble in the bowl.<br />There doesn't appear to be any allergic reactions to the kibble.<br />Therefore, I would recommend this kibble to anyone who wishes to feed their dog, a brand of commercially produced kibble.<br />If I knew how and had the time, I would prefer to feed him "home" made food.

review/summary: Healthy Skin, More Energy
review/text: I have a purebred Shih-tsu adopted from the local pound. The brand of food I had been getting from a local feed store had a recall a couple of years ago and this year the food seemed to be buggy and not very fresh.  I switched to a "premium" brand available at Walmart and boy, did I regret it!  My poor little guy is always itchy in the humid summers but this time his skin was bright pink and he scratched a bare spot on his side. His fur was brittle and he seemed miserable.<br /><br />An Amazon friend suggested I try this dog food.  I was delighted to find it being carried by my favorite local groomer.  I switched my little guy to INNOVA SMALL BITES gradually.  He has been eating nothing but INNOVA for just a few weeks and already I can see the difference.  His skin looks healthy and he is bouncing with happy energy.<br /><br />I'm switching to INNOVA treats now.  My little buddy deserves the best for his loyal companionship.  I recommend INNOVA products for your cat or dog.

review/summary: A Very Good High Quality Food For Little Guys & Gals
review/text: I have been feeding Innova Small Bites to my 2 Papillons for over two years now. They both love it. One is 4 years the other 10. At first I thought I might be starting the younger out a little soon on an adult food but he has done great on it. When you look at the Innova brand the ingredients are pretty similar. They fill up on less food. Their stools are small and firm. Most importantly they have never been to the vet except for shots ! Even if it costs a little more it saves you money in the long run !<br />You really do get what you pay for in dog food. Organic, as possible, is the way to go.<br />Now that my little girl is getting older and not running around as much I have incorporated some Innova Low Fat into their mix and that hasn't bothered either of them at all ! The kibble is a little bigger ( maybe twice ) but that is still very small and easy for small dogs to eat.<br />I have to be creative because these two are going to eat only what the other does ! So I not only have to please a 4 & 10 year old but make a diet that is healthy for both !<br />Innova makes that easier than most products on the market !

review/summary: Best Candy Melt to work with in my experience
review/text: I recently decided to jump on the bandwagon and give cake balls a whirl for a July 4th Party I was having.  I had never even seen, much less heard of candy melts prior to this undertaking.  Of course, where do I go first when looking for something? Amazon.com!  Now...I live in Texas and it's H-O-T right now, so I was concerned about product "meltage" during shipping. I drove myself on over to Michael's and purchased a plethora of Wilton Candy Melts. Well, I couldn't help myself...based on the positive reviews of the Mercken's Candy coatings, I decided to go ahead and order some White (5 lbs) and Blue (1 lb.) Candy Coating.  To my surprise, both arrived without melting...shocker!  A few days later, I ordered Yellow Mercken's (1 lb.) and Paramount crystals, along with a couple other items.  This shipment came and the candy melts had, well, melted! The Paramount Crystals were also a melted mess, but I figured since it was going to be liquified anyway...no harm no foul (or is it "fowl'?).  I wasn't surprised by this...have you ever BEEN to Texas in late June? As my late Grandmother would say "It's as hot as Corn Liquor!" (not that she knew how hot that was, since she NEVER drank alcohol in her 94 years!) So, I will not remove a single star from my rating based on this product melting...after all, it is INTENDED to melt! ***take note you star-removers, you know who you are, you're the people who rate a PRODUCT based on the shipper or other acts of God which have nothing to do with the actual worthiness of the product itself. Rant over.<br /><br />Okay...now that I got the "back-story" out of the way...the actual review!  I set about making some chocolate (inside) cake balls along with some cheesecake balls, which were oh-so-yummy, but a big, fat, time-consuming pain. Once again, I digress. I also was going to be dipping pretzel rods and Oreos...a regular "dip-fest" as it were.  Being one to experiment until I find the best/easiest...I melted some white almond bark (had used in the past for white and choc dipped pretzels with good success), Wilton's Candy Melts, Ghirardelli White Chocolate (the bars for baking $$$$$), and finally the Mercken's Candy Melts.  Of the 4, the Mercken's was the "winner" as far as ease of dipping, smooth consistency and taste.  I hesitate to put taste in there, because it's so subjective and besides, they all tasted good to me. But, I do realize taste is an important consideration for most people. Really, the Ghirardelli had the best taste, but the cost and the difficulty in it "setting up" as nicely gave the edge to Mercken's for this project. The Mercken's did edge out the Wilton candy melts as far as MY taste buds go. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Basically, if you're particular, like I am, and the extra cost doesn't bother you, go with the Mercken's .  If this is a project with and for the kiddos, the Wilton melts will be hunky dory. It's not that Mercken's is head and shoulders above Wilton's candy melts, just moderately so. Wilton's are certainly more widely available, cost less and come in more colors.<br /><br />Bottom line (for me) is that Mercken's was easiest to work with and that was the biggest factor in my preference.  With the sprinkles and candy coating...all the desserts were so uber-RICH and sugary, I rightly figured the cake-pops and such wouldn't get eaten as much as they would be looked at for their decorating value and cuteness factor. My soiree hosted no kids...just a a house full of (thirsty) adults who were more focused on the offerings of adult beverages and jello shots than they were the desserts.

This is worrying because yiner IS TOXIC once it is left for long periods of time (~12 hrs) as it begins to release HNO2. Color is also unnaturally white, while yiner that I am used to is more of an elephant-tusk off-white, suggesting that the lack of texture may be from bleach

review/text: This cereal is great with milk or eaten plain.  It is one of those cereals that you can put in a baggie and take with you for a snack. It's also very filling.<br /><br />I wrote a comment on one of the reviewers because her review was misleading.  This comment was erased somehow, so I am clarifying with my own review.<br /><br />Someone wrote that each bite had a heaping dose of sodium.  One serving of this cereal has 150 mg of sodium which is equal to a dash and a half of salt. This person also said that each one is bound together with a 1/4 tsp. of sugar.  A serving has about 7 grams of sugar which is equal to about a teaspoon and a half.  Each serving has about 65 pieces in it so that means that each piece of cereal has just a sprinkling of sugar.<br /><br />The "healthy" shake mentioned by a reviewer has over twice the amount of sodium and about 5 times the amount of sugar as a serving of this cereal.  This shake recipe was changed when I mentioned how much sugar was in her "healthy" shake.  It previously included an orange.  The nutritional facts on this shake were not mentioned.<br /><br />I have no problem with someone giving their honest opinion about something but I have a big problem when a person is so misleading about the facts.

review/summary: The Box says "OATMEAL SQUARES" which I believe is FALSE advertising.,
review/text: Oatmeal Squares is in about the largest print you can fit on the Box.  When you read the ingredients, the second largest ingredient is WHEAT flour. So how can it rightfully be called a "Crunchy Oat Cereal".<br /><br />I wonder why Quaker which is noted for Oatmeal has to be somewhat deceptive and not disclose upfront that this is not completely an Oat Cereal and then go on to make claims about Cholesterol Lowering when it is not ALL Oat Flour.<br /><br />Oatmeal is made from oats not wheat.

review/summary: Excellent healthy product to substitute corn flakes with.
review/text: This Oatmeal squares is delicious, lower your blood cholesterol and is an excellent substitute for corn flakes that is far less healthy and full of sugar. This Quacker product has only 9 grams of sugar and is a perfect mix with milk and/or soy milk and honey and/or cinnamon. Try it and you will simply love it.

review/summary: Delicious, just a hint of sweetness
review/text: These satisfy my craving to crunch around on something grainy. Yum, yum with fresh fruit! My husband loves them too and he is not exactly a healthy food eater. You might think at first they will be very coarse like mini wheats or those larger "bales" my dad used to eat. They are smoother and full of oaty goodness when you bite into them. Stay nice in milk, still crunchy while I write this review :-)

review/summary: Full of salty sugary goodness in every bite
review/text: I got a free sample of this in the mail.<br /><br />This has a delightful crunch, better than any crunch I've experienced in a breakfast cereal.<br />However, I find it overwhelmingly sweet. I try to avoid sugar as much as possible but I feel like I'm eating mouthfuls of it with this.<br /><br />These are small squares that look like Wheatchex cereal. They don't get soggy fast in milk.<br />They don't have much if any flavor except for the sweetness. I give the texture and crunch an A but the flavor an F.<br /><br />And after you eat this there is a terrible aftertaste like you ate the cardboard box.<br />This aftertaste lingers for a while forcing me to hurry and brush the nasty taste out of my mouth. Even after brushing my teeth I still have that stale taste in my mouth which reminds me of the glue they used in the packaging.<br /><br />Here are the nutrition facts:<br /><br />Nutrition Facts<br /><br />Serving Size<br />1 cup (56.0 g)<br /><br />Amount Per Serving<br />Calories<br />212<br /><br />% Daily Value*<br /><br />Total Fat 4.4g<br /><br />4%<br /><br />Saturated Fat<br />0.5g<br /><br />3%<br /><br />Polyunsaturated Fat 5.0g<br /><br />Monounsaturated Fat 20.8g<br /><br />Cholesterol<br />0mg<br /><br />0%<br /><br />Sodium<br />269mg<br /><br />11%<br /><br />Total Carbohydrates<br />43.9g<br /><br />15%<br /><br />Dietary Fiber<br />4.0g<br /><br />16%<br /><br />Sugars<br />9.0g<br /><br />Protein<br />6.2g<br /><br />Vitamin A 11%*<br /><br />Vitamin C 11%<br /><br />Calcium 11%*<br /><br />Iron 95%<br /><br />The first four ingredients are: Whole grain oat flour, whole wheat flour, brown sugar, sugar...<br /><br />This looks like dog food kibble bits made of baked oat and wheat flour, each one bound together with a one quarter teaspoon full of sugar, combined with a chemical slurry of preservatives. You also get a heaping dose of salt in each bite with the sodium being 150 mg.<br /><br />So when you eat this, you are literally eating baked squares of flour, sugar and salt, bound together with preservatives, and flavored with the taste of the packaging.<br /><br />I tried eating a big bowl of oatmeal every single morning for two months, getting my cholesterol tested before I started, and after and guess what? It didn't come down at all.<br />If people are eating this junk thinking it's something good for them due to having oat flour in it they are deluding themselves. They need to try eating a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast every single morning, getting their cholesterol tested before and after, the way I did. Eating oats every day only works for some people to lower cholesterol, not for everyone. And this has so much sugar and salt and wheat flour and preservatives that it negates any slight benefits of the small amount of oat flour in this.<br /><br />Or, they can keep thinking how healthy they are being by eating this. This is pure junk food. If you want to lower cholesterol with food, or at least try to see if you are one of the lucky ones it works for, eat oatmeal and skip all the sugar and salt and preservatives that are in this. It tastes a lot better too.<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />A teaspoon of sugar is 4.2 grams. A cup of this contains 9 grams, over 2 teaspoons of sugar in a one cup bowlfull.<br /><br />For me, this is too much salt and sugar to start my day with.<br /><br />This also contains dye number 5, and dye number 6. According to Wikipedia:<br /><br />"new studies now point to synthetic preservatives and artificial coloring agents as aggravating ADD and ADHD symptoms, both in those affected by these disorders and in the general population."<br /><br />Note the above sentence where it says not only are people with ADD and ADHD affected by these dyes, but the general population is also. Num num! How healthy!<br /><br />Is it healthier to eat this instead of oatmeal?<br /><br />The Oatmeal is better for you...<br />Quaker Instant Oatmeal : 107 calories, 1.3 g fat, 151 mg salt<br />Quaker Oatmeal Squares: 212 cal, 2.4 g fat, 268.8 mg salt<br /><br />I'm puzzled by the reviews that sound as if this is a health food. But I'm sure that<br />the food marketing scientists at Quaker knew that if they put OATMEAL on the box in big letters, some people would misunderstand. Why eat oatmeal when you can eat "Oatmeal Squares"?

Not great but okay.  They are also bigger than most gummi's.  We didn't know they would be so big so we ordered more than we had to.  I think three for each person is plenty.

review/summary: Love these chips, but shame on Amazon
review/text: I discovered these chips in a vending machine at work, and they are excellent.  So I got on the 'net to see if I could find them, and sure enough, Amazon carries them... WITH free super saver shipping!!!  So I ordered.  When they arrived today, I opened the box and discovered that they were double boxed!!!  Which would have been a *great* idea... except that the inner box had been *extremely* crushed BEFORE they put it into the outer box.  I suspect they double boxed it to hide the original box, as no shipper would have accepted it for shipment, or customer accepted it at delivery.  So I'm VERY disappointed with Amazon.  This isn't the first time that I've received goods from Amazon that were VERY poorly packed, but fortunately in previous instances, it didn't result in any damage that rendered the products unusable.  In this case, although they aren't "unusable", they are certainly smashed into "tortilla crumbs" rather than "rounds".  I would have been extremely upset had I paid a dime for shipment of this caliber.  COME ON, AMAZON!!!  I'm going to email them and suggest to them that if this is how they choose to treat their shipments and customers, in the future I will be inclined to shop other web sites before patronizing theirs.

review/summary: Absolutely The BEST!!
review/text: My wife and I discovered these fantastic chips at a rest area in Texas while on a road trip. The price for the 7.5 oz bag in the vending seemed high, 1.00 ea., however; after the first crunchy bite - we were hooked! Can't seem to find them anywhere at any type of retail outlet. We are in Broken Arrow, OK on another road trip and I just got back from the vending machines. The snack machine was packed with these, but the owner of the vending service is very clever indeed. The chips are always behind bags of other chips and snacks. I had to buy three bags of assorted snack chips before I got the three SALSITAS - SALSA CHIPS! I spent 6 bucks altogether! But these are so tasty and really far better than any other chip from any other company, of any other falvor - that I would pay the price again and again! I am sure the vending service owner must have tasted these and has strategically placed them about, knowing that folks will buy the other chips "out of the way" in order to get SALSITAS. Damn fine chip!

review/summary: Flavorful chips need no salsa !!
review/text: We love these chips !!  They are spicy and flavorful enough for us, but not too spicy for the heat-impaired. It's as if the salsa is incorporated into the chips, so no salsa is necessary to give them extra flavor.  The only problem was the packing, which seems to be an ongoing theme with Amazon -- sometimes they arrive packed in only one box, rather than a box within a box.

review/text: First, I would like to state that the free shipping was very fast, it took about 3 days to arrive.<br /><br />The chips weren't as flavorful as I was hoping.  The spices are pretty mild and lacked kick.  It was a generic southwest flavor.  It was hard to distinguish the avacado.  After the reviews, I was expecting better.  They are still good chips, but I wouldn't have bought a 12 case of them if I tried them before.<br /><br />Kudos for fast shipping, ho hum on the chips.

review/text: Very good value from Amazon and a very addicting taste. Good chips to get if you don't want to mess with dips.  The expiration date was 4 months away from purchase so no worries there.  I managed to eat the entire case within one month anyhow :)  A response to the single 1 star review earlier, the chips were not supposed to be cheesy like Nacho Cheese Doritos taste.  These were very crispy and fresh.  I may try their other popular flavor next.  The only small negative was that one out of 12 of the bags had a small tear in the center bottom and leaked a bit and there were some crumbs inside the shipping box.  The chips shipped directly from the El Sabroso factory in Los Angeles, 60 miles away.

review/text: This is either a new adventure or an all-new low - reviewing a snack on Amazon.com...<br /><br />But I'll keep this quick - this are a very uniquely flavored snack.  I first tried them from a vending machine at a power plant out in Conesville, PA.  Before long I was emptying the machine, and actually began adding them to Campbells (tm) Chicken Tortilla soup - in which there isn't much chicken or tortillas.  The flavor these chips added to the soup was remarkeable.  Unfortunately the vending machine was no longer stocked with the chip, and so I have turned to Amazon.com of all places to feed my hunger!

I have purchased three (3) boxes and given then out to my friends (and have eaten a 'few' myself). Everyone loves them. I received my most recent shipment today and when I opened the box, I realized that there were only eleven bags. The box had been taped up as it had been previously opened. To Whom do I file a complaint?? I will no doubt order these chips again but I want to make sure I receive my full shipment the next time!

review/summary: THESE CHIPS HAVE MSG (Monosodium glutamate ) IN THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: Answer<br />Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer commonly added to Chinese food, canned vegetables, soups and processed meats. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified MSG as a food ingredient that is "generally recognized as safe," the use of MSG remains controversial.<br /><br />MSG has been used as a food additive for decades. Over the years, the FDA has received many anecdotal reports of adverse reactions to foods containing MSG. But subsequent research found no definitive evidence of a link between MSG and the symptoms that some people described after eating food containing MSG. As a result, MSG is still added to some foods.<br /><br />A comprehensive review of all available scientific data on glutamate safety sponsored by the FDA in 1995 reaffirmed the safety of MSG when consumed at levels typically used in cooking and food manufacturing. The report found no evidence to suggest that MSG contributes to any long-term health problems, such as Alzheimer's disease. But it did acknowledge that some people may have short-term reactions to MSG. These reactions -- known as MSG symptom complex -- may include:<br /><br />Headache, sometimes called MSG headache<br />Flushing<br />Sweating<br />Sense of facial pressure or tightness<br />Numbness, tingling or burning in or around the mouth<br />Rapid, fluttering heartbeats (heart palpitations)<br />Chest pain<br />Shortness of breath<br />Symptoms are usually mild and don't require treatment. However, some people report more severe reactions. The only way to prevent a reaction is to avoid foods containing MSG. When MSG is added to food, the FDA requires that "monosodium glutamate" be listed on the label -- or on the menu, in restaurants.<br /><br />MORE ON THIS TOPIC<br />Migraine<br />Sodium: Are you getting too much?<br /><br />RELATED<br />Too skinny?

review/summary: Salsitas Salsa chips
review/text: I hate to spoil all these 5stars ratings for this product, but I did not like these chips at all. My reason for buying these in the first place, without tasting them first, were the 5star ratings. I felt the chips were not crunchy enough, it did not have a cheesy flavor, it taste too much of garlic and bellpeppers.I even tasted  a cucumber flavor. it has like a vegetable garden flavor to it. I gave all eleven bags away. I would have spent my money better, if I had purchase Doritos instead.

review/text: Omaha Steaks collections make a great gift. Especially the non-steak samplers. Good food to put in the freezer and use when you don't want to cook (which in my house is daily). Their steaks are ok - not great - but usually better than supermarket meats!
