review/summary: STRONG!
review/text: I had heard of this brand of coffees, but had never tried one, until now.  I did not know what to expect, but I think I thought it would be like one of those iced coffee drinks.<br /><br />It's not, at least not to me.  First of all, on the can it says not to shake it.  Iam not sure why.  I had put the can in my refrigerator to chill it for several hours.<br /><br />Each can is 6.8 fl ounces, which is one serving, has 50 calories, total carbs-12 grams, sugars-10 grams, and 155 milligrams of caffeine.  On the caffeine scale I have no idea how high that caffeine level is on a scale from low to high, but by my taste buds I would say it ranges on the higher side due to the STRONG coffee taste that this has, at least to me.<br /><br />I did not find this Caffe Italian Expresso Style Coffee Drink to be sweet at all.  All I tasted was a STRONG coffee flavor, no other flavor was pronounced.<br /><br />That may be because it's an expresso type drink.  Expresso is always a stronger coffee.<br /><br />I do know this, and that is I couldn't drink more than a few sips of this drink out of the can, just the way it is.<br /><br />It's just way too strong for me, but I think if I put it into a taller glass, add some ice and some flavored liquid creamer, it would taste much better to me.<br /><br />For those of you who love STRONG coffee beverages, you may just love this one!<br /><br />To me it packs a real coffee punch for a can of this size!

review/summary: Okay Coffee. It has good flavour, but is weak for my taste
review/text: I usually have very low expectations for these kind of canned coffee, but this one was better than I thought. It has a sweet coffee taste, reminding of real espresso. However, it felt more like americano than espresso (meaning it is more diluted with water than necessary). It still packs enough caffeine, and if you do not want to go the "5 hour energy" route in urgent needs (like driving early in the morning), it would be a good alternative.<br /><br />I would recommend it cold, so keeping in the car might not be an option. Nevertheless, it's good enough for the product category (canned coffee).

review/summary: Nice medium sweet cold espresso
review/text: My wife ran across this specific brand in Japan last year and said it was every bit as good as the canned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BZODI">Starbucks Espresso</a> competitor and a lot cheaper (check prices). I refrigerated my sample and split it with my wife, and as daily AM quadruple espresso drinkers, this hit the spot. She usually has her espresso with sweetener, and I like mine bitter and black. We found this to be a pleasant in-between sweetness that we both liked. Neither of us added anything. Cold, unshaken, right out of the can.<br /><br />My rule when I get free stuff to review: Would I buy this with my own money? My answer: yes. We're going on an upcoming vacation in the wilds of Northern Wisconsin and I'm getting a case of this, as well as a case of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino</a> which I've also reviewed. This product and the Illy cappuccino are spot on for a couple of espresso caffeine addicts.

review/summary: Good coffee - arabica is the best, nice flavor, convenient
review/text: As you can tell from my user name, I'm a bit of a coffee lover and have been for years however, I despise crummy coffee, instant coffee, coffee fillers, artifical flavorings etc...I like rich, dark arabica coffee served strong and black.<br /><br />Typically I grind my own (organic) beans using a vintage mill and french press but there are times when it's not possible to make a decent cup of coffee. This fits the bill perfectly. A nice balance, not weak but not overpowering, solid arabic rather than the inferior robusta and all the convenience. Kosher (important) and relatively free from preservatives etc... I wish there was an organic option but aside from that, I was very impressed by the flavor.

review/summary: Strong coffee beverage with a little sweetness
review/text: I like to have a few cold canned coffee beverages on hand, as I prefer them to most energy drinks. Unfortunately finding one that isn't filled with sweeteners has become very difficult.  Living in the Seattle area I was already familiar with illy for their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYUI">coffee beans</a> that are used in some of my favorite coffee houses. So being given the chance to try some of their canned coffee beverages was something I was looking forward to.<br /><br />After spending the night in the fridge, I opened the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Caff&egrave;</a> without shaking it as noted on the can and poured it into a glass. (*See customer images) The color was very nice, it looked like a strong cup of coffee. The smell was good too and although I knew it was sweetened it wasn't coming across too much. The coffee was strong, very smooth and thankfully not too sweet. I was able to enjoy the entire can in one sitting.<br /><br />Overall illy issimo has a great product and for once I've found one that isn't too sweet for me to enjoy. Plus now that I have been introduced to their canned coffee line I am looking forward to trying this one next: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I2FGQE">illy issimo Caff&egrave; (No Sugar)</a>

review/summary: A little too strong for me
review/text: Illy coffee is not new to me. I have been buying their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYTE">illy, Ground Espresso Coffe, Fine Grind (Dark Roast, Black Band), 8.8-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>. I will admit I bought it more than a few years ago. After awhile my taste changed and I liked drinks with more of a cream flavor to them.<br /><br />Illy makes a lot of great drinks. I buy them when I run out to the drugstore as a pick me up or a treat for myself. They are pricey but they do give you a quick jolt of the caffeine for pick up. I have not tried the caffe' can locally. I made sure it was very chilled in my fridge and like all my other cold coffee drinks, drank it with a straw. I had a hard time getting this down. It was my first drink of the day and being a caffeine junkie, thought it would be easier to swallow, it was not. Understand it is an espresso drink that has no cream to it so it is very bold tasting, almost bitter to me. I tried to suck it down and had to take small sips it was so strong. I did finish it though.<br /><br />I can't say I would buy this again since it is not to my liking. I now like my cold coffee drinks to have a cream added to them or a flavor. This drink is very bold and strong. If you are not familiar with how strong it is, you might not even be able to keep it down.<br /><br />Size wise I compare it to Starbucks double shots drinks but without the cream. I drink a ton of Starbucks cold coffee beverages since they carry them in bulk where I live. However, it might compare size wise but again, no cream. Illy also only has 50 calories if calories are a factor for you. I like to drink cold coffee with lower calories in case I drink two a day but can't say this is one I would factor in because of the low calories.<br /><br />Glad I tried it but can't say I would buy it again. If I were on a road trip and this was the only coffee sold at a gas station I might buy it as a pick me up. A regular drink, not for me, Illy has much better drinks out there in my opinion.

review/summary: Solid Canned Coffe Drink
review/text: Although no canned coffee will come close to fresh brewed, within their own category there is a broad spectrum of quality.  The illy issimo Coffee Drink falls in the upper end.  It is labeled Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink, and as such has a strong, somewhat bitter flavor. This is balanced by the added sugar which makes the drink moderately sweet.  More preferable than the cloyingly sweet taste that proliferates in canned coffee drinks.  If you are looking for a brisk pick-me-up, the illy issimo does the trick.

review/summary: I liked it; I still prefer black, hot coffee, but this could be an occasional switch
review/text: I have tried a variety of chilled coffee/espresso drinks, and while I like them individually, I have yet to find any drink that I would go out of my way to try repeatedly. Maybe this didn't amaze me, but I liked that it was an adult coffee drink.<br /><br />I drink black coffee with no sugar - and I drink a lot of it. The good thing about this brand is, like another reviewer said, the coffee is the star. I tried it right after a cup of my normal hot coffee, and it did not pale in comparison.<br /><br />I drank the Caffe chilled and it was not bitter or over-sweet like so many of these drinks. I normally drink high-end coffee, and this tasted pretty legit in comparison. So I think quality ingredients were used.<br /><br />It's a little stronger than my normal coffee - which it should be, since it's an espresso drink.<br /><br />Another review thought the sugar overwhelmed the flavor. It's funny - I didn't get that at all. It IS a little sweet (and sugar is the second listed ingredient), but it wasn't something I noticed that much.<br /><br />Bottom line - good ingredients + adult taste = solid quality.<br /><br />If you're a black/hot coffee fan like me this probably won't change your habits, but for a hot day this might be a good switch.

review/summary: Sugar Overwhelms Rich Espresso Coffee Flavor
review/text: If you generally prefer black coffee (as I do), you will probably find that the sugar (10g) overwhelms the rich espresso coffee flavor of this ILLY ISSIMO "Caff&egrave;" drink.  That's too bad, because the coffee itself tastes delicious.  Apparently this canned espresso drink is designed to deliver a quick caffeine/sugar "pick me up" jolt.<br /><br />I think that the product is intended to be consumed straight from the can, at room temperature.  The can includes a "do not shake" warning, but has no instructions for chilling or warming the contents.  Because I don't care for iced coffee, I tried the product only (1) at room temperature straight from the aluminum can, and (2) after warming in a microwave-safe cup.  It tasted about the same both ways.<br /><br />This "Italian espresso-style coffee drink" certainly did not convert me to canned coffee drinks, especially ones with 50 calories in each 6.8 fl. oz. can.  I drink a lot of coffee, and prefer to brew it myself from freshly ground whole coffee beans.  However, because ILLY ISSIMO "Caff&egrave;" tastes like it's made with high-quality coffee, I award it 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.

review/summary: Very Nice Coffee Drink
review/text: I love coffee, and this drink didn't disappoint.  Just pour over ice for a nice, refreshing Americano-style coffee drink.<br /><br />This is not an unsweetened drink; one can contains the equivalent of about 2 1/2 tsp. sugar, which is not too excessive in this day and age of sugar addiction.<br /><br />Recommended for a quick, refreshing coffee pick-up.  Would be 5 stars if they'd used Splenda or Stevia instead of sugar.

review/text: I use decaf illy coffee for my morning cup of coffee and love it. It costs a little more, but is very worth it. As far as the espresso drink...not for me. I tend to like lattes or cappuccinos--something with more milk/cream. This was too strong for me. My son tried it however, and loved it.

review/summary: Tastes like medium roast espresso
review/text: I like strong coffee - have a Keurig for my daily brews, and stop by Starbucks every couple of days.  So I thought I'd give this a try - I'm tired of the generic energy drink taste. This tastes like a medium roast Espresso, with the same after-taste. It has only 50 calories, although I'd prefer no calories. I did not pour over ice - drank from the can right out of the fridge. That's plenty cold, easier to carry, and I can keep a can in my pack when on the road.  You can also keep the can in the freezer for about a couple of hour before sticking in a backpack, so it will be ice cold several hours later.<br /><br />At 6.8 oz, the can is thicker than a Red Bull can (8.4 oz), and a tad bit shorter.  Definitely worth a try!

review/text: This was pretty good. It had a little too strong of a coffee flavor for me so I added some milk to mine. I served it cold over ice. I love iced coffee drinks. The can was pretty small so it only has 12 carbs so that was good for me. The caffeine count must be pretty high though because I became quite jittery from it. The combination of sugar and caffeine does quite a job on me personally.<br /><br />I did like it and would try it again but I did like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> better.

review/summary: Tasty but rather sweet
review/text: I'm usually not a fan of canned coffee drinks, but wanted to try this since I love Illy espresso beans. While the canned version can't compare to a properly pulled shot of espresso, this is a pretty tasty alternative. Good flavor without the odd after-taste I've experienced with other canned coffee drinks.<br /><br />I tried it right out of the can (room temp) and over ice. I found it more enjoyable straight from the can.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's a bit on the sweet side. I never add sugar to my coffee so I'm sensitive to any level of sweetness. Others may find the sweetness level to be fine.<br /><br />But, even with the sweetness, I would certainly get this again. It provides for a tasty afternoon pickup.

review/summary: Rich coffee taste with the convenience of a can
review/text: The illy issimo Coffee Caff&egrave; drink had a nice, clean, rich flavor, both at room temperature and poured over ice.  I liked it over ice the best.  There is just the right balance of coffee and enough sugar to make it appealing but not so much that it overpowers the drink or leaves an aftertaste.  The convenience of popping open a can for a great tasting caffeine fix is appealing.  And a good jolt of caffeine it is:  155 mg. per 6.8 ounce serving.  (The size of the can.)  Compare that to 48 mg. per 16.9 ounces of caffeine in Coke Zero.<br /><br />The ingredient list is pretty simple: Coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quick, bold, full-bodied, Italian espresso-style coffee drink, look no further.  This is a good one.

review/text: I always expect these cans of coffee to be very creamy and sugary no matter what is written on the label; a contrast to how I drink my hot coffee.<br /><br />Instead, this one is cold black coffee lightly sweetened - they did a pretty good job on the sugar level.<br /><br />It is worlds better than most of the other cold coffees without cream that I have had, most of which have been out of 2 liter plastic bottles in Japan, which are always extremely disappointing.  I can't give it a 5 because I don't love it, but I suspect that it is the best of its type one can get; you can sense that the quality is there.  It doesn't suffer too much from being cold because it doesn't seem watered down, like most usually do.

There's a suble creama left in the glass like an espresso would have, but lacking any grittiness.<br /><br />This drink defintely provides a jolt of 155 mg of caffeine for those on the run.  Its contents contain coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate.  Each small can has around 50 calories.<br /><br />I prefer a coffee drink with a slightly less bitter taste.  But for someone who needs a fast caffeine fix, this should fit the bill.

The portion size was great and would be easy to double stack in most fridges.  The coffee didn't have an artificial flavor and was actually quite good.

review/summary: An "Energy Beverage" canned by Coca Cola - It's not good
review/text: I have come to expect Illy coffee to symbolize good and consistent quality. I do prefer other brands of espresso, but Illy's consistency is great since it is to be found in many restaurants around the globe.<br /><br />So it is with some sadness that I write a negative review. First off - please note that this is actually a coffee flavored energy beverage made and packaged by Coca Cola. Illy has partnered in order to take proceeds by allowing their name to be used. There might be a some of their coffee used, but it would be processed coffee extract, and so there wouldn't be much reason to use expensive Arabica coffee when extract from lower quality Robusto would work.<br /><br />This canned beverage seems to taste pleasant enough at first, but then it starts to turn metallic. The coffee flavor really is a 'coffee flavor'. There is just something artificial and chemical tasting about this drink. Granted, it's only 45 calories, most coming from the beet extract sweetener.  And don't be fooled by beet sweetener, it's really no different than any other unbleached sugar.  It is regularly used to Chaptalize wine in fact.  Don't be lured in by the low calorie claim: fresh brewed iced coffee without sweetener? Zero calories. Yes. Zero. (okay, actually 0.01 calories! sorry!) So it's not like they're really doing anything crazy by offering this at 45 calories.  It's just less sugar added than the super sweet beverages.  Really it seems the sweetener was added to try and mask the artificial and metallic flavor.<br /><br />There are better iced coffees on the market.  I hope we really start to see some more variety and availability soon.  Other countries like Japan have a huge market for bottled and canned unsweetened tea and coffee, so hopefully we can get on the bandwagon soon.  Hopefully with better tasting results.

review/summary: What is this product supposed to be?
review/text: I do not buy coffee because I need a burst of energy or alertness because caffeine does not have a significant effect upon me.  I buy coffee because I like coffee and the stronger, bolder tasting coffees appeal to me the most.  I also do not appreciate coffees that derive their stronger flavor by over burning the beans during roasting.  I like strong coffees that get their stronger taste from significantly lower water content during brewing.  All other things being equal, this high coffee to water ratio gives a fuller flavor, but at a higher cost.  If money were an issue, I would rather have fewer cups of fuller tasting coffee than many more cups of weaker, less full bodied coffee.  This Illy Italian style espresso meets none of the requirements of a good cup of coffee except that it is made from Arabica beans which tend to be less acidic, smoother and fuller bodied.  However, there are some Arabica beans that are better than others and Arabica beans are no guarantee of a good cup of coffee.<br /><br /> I would only drink this coffee under conditions of extreme thirst.  I believe this can of espresso "tasting" coffee compromises on so many elements of good tasting coffee such that I would not want to drink it again.  First, the espresso is weak and it probably derives whatever taste it has by over burning the beans at roasting giving it a bitter taste as opposed to a bold taste.  I know that burning the beans somewhat gives espresso its flavor by releasing more oil from the beans which allows for a frothier and smoother coffee when brewed at higher pressures.  This Illy espresso did release some additional oil, but the taste was not bold because too little coffee was used in brewing.  This does not make Italian style espresso, it makes a weak espresso with a hint of burned coffee beans that I doubt that espresso drinkers will find appealing.  Also, this espresso style coffee has a taste that cannot be described as coffee-like.  If anything it has a chemical like bitter taste that is almost sweet.  Overall, it leaves a bitter and unidentifiable taste.  Perhaps some of the metallic taste from the can has impacted the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />I do not know what this product attempts to be because of all of the compromises concerning its taste, its strength, its name, its market and its price, most of which seem to be contradictory.  I think Illy needs to go back to the drawing board to list what qualities they are trying to produce and see if that is possible in the market.  Otherwise they seem to have met none and made a product that I believe satisfies few.<br /><br />Lastly, the qualities of coffee are varied and thus a matter of personal preference.  I have noticed that those who do not really appreciate a good cup of coffee tend to classify coffee into two categories that are sufficient for them.  Those categories simply classify coffee into those that are weak or strong, modified by too weak or too strong.  I suspect that these adjectives are sufficient for a majority and tend to simplify life by not seeking the cup of coffee that is just right.  Of course, such people would use time saved on the search for truly satisfying coffee by substituting wine for coffee or colors of paint on their walls.  It seems that everyone has their specialty product of which they are aficionados.  For kids it might be cereal for blue collar workers it may be beer.  It makes one wonder if writing a review has already been done on a non-published basis for virtually all products where a choice exists.  To summarize, I don't like Illy espresso drink but I do like a fresh Guinness Draft even though I am retired.

review/summary: Very Bitter, Not So Sweet...
review/text: I drink my coffee in much the same way a 12 year old probably would...very light and very sweet. I found this coffee drink to be extremely bitter and not nearly sweet enough. I noticed some people here saying this was too sweet, but I just did NOT find that to be the case. It also left a very strong and not-so-pleasant after taste. If you like your coffee strong and black, then you'll probably really like this. However if you're a cream and sugar kinda person, this will most likely be too bitter for you.

review/summary: Strong, Bitter -- but that's coffee!!
review/text: I made the mistake of taking my first sip of this coffee after tasting something sweet. It's bitter! But tasting it later I came to appreciate the flavor.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of canned/bottled coffee drinks, to me this tasted like real coffee. Nice and strong, not too sweet. If you put a lot of sweet-and-white in your coffee, you will find this drink unbearably bitter, in that case I recommend the Cappucino version of the same brand.<br /><br />Nutrition facts: 50 calories in the can, 20mg sodium, 12 carbs (10g sugars, 1g fiber) -- which isn't bad. Caffeine content is 155 mg in the 6.8 fl oz. The ingredients list coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. No milk, which is healthier, and I prefer that because I'm lactose intolerant. It also means it lasts longer -- the best-by date on my sample can is Sept. '12 (received April).<br /><br />The can lists this nice coffee as a Product of Denmark. I've tasted coffee in Denmark, and I can't dispute that, though I can tell you this method is a whole lot cheaper.<br /><br />I drank it cold and I really enjoyed this coffee. I would really like to get more... but it is a bit pricy. If you are on the go a lot this is an easy solution.

It's It may therefore, be more to the liking of coffee purists. illy drinks are available only in the cans (not in glass). While I might prefer glass, these cans are the only option for illy. They are available in 12 packs through Amazon. With a larger order you can get them with no charge for shipping making for a competitive price. They do not need to be refrigerated at all. However, they do taste better if refrigerated prior to consumption.

review/summary: A little sweet, a little bitter, very good going down
review/text: At just 50 calories in a 6.8 ounce can, it seems almost impossible that the drink should be this good. At once slightly sweet with the bitter tinge of a good cup of coffee, illy issimo rivals the Starbucks' espresso shots for quality quick canned coffee drinks. Aftertaste is minimal is the drink has a good color and consistency (not too watery and not too syrupy).

review/summary: Sweet and strong iced coffee
review/text: This Illy Caffe coffee tastes a lot like a Starbucks dark roast with way too much sugar. It is much sweeter than I would normally drink coffee, but with small sips, it was quite enjoyable. 6.8 oz is the right size, because I couldn't take much more of the sweetness.<br /><br />Despite all that extra sweetness, you can't miss the deep, rich, bold Illy-quality coffee. If you like dark coffees, it might be worth a try for you.<br /><br />I would have given it 3 stars due to too much sugar, but the coffee taste is worth 5 stars.

review/text: Even though I hate sugar in any coffee beverage, this is pretty good. At 45 calories a can, there are probably 3 teaspoons of sugar. That's kinda hefty, but it doesn't taste that sweet. While it has a pretty strong flavor, it certainly doesn't have the robust, fresh ground flavor one may expect from Illy. And, it tastes like it's been sitting in a can, because it has. Maybe  they'll ship in glass and solve the metal aftertaste issue?

review/summary: Strong Coffee Taste
review/text: This coffee drink has a much stronger coffee taste than most -- and I like that.  I don't drink a lot of coffee products, but when I do I want something that is definitely coffee and not a confusing combination of flavors and sweeteners.  In addition to the strong coffee taste, there is a hint of bitterness but it's not unpleasant.  This is not a beverage I would drink daily -- I think it would lose some of its excitement and get a bit boring -- but it's nice to have a few cans in the refrigerator.  By the way, I tried heating a serving... don't bother, this drink is absolutely at its best served well chilled.

review/text: I will say up front, I am not a coffee drinker. I do like iced coffees but rarely. Compared with the Starbucks bottled Frappacinos, I would say this coffee drink rivaled them. It was delicious and just the right size. It gave a good jolt of energy but I must say I like the fact it was 45 calories. That's a whole lot less than the bottled Starbucks! No preservatives and low calorie plus delicious! Great combo in my opinion!

review/summary: Not very good...had that stale coffee taste.
review/text: I drink a good bit of coffee, most of it iced, so I was expecting something decent with the illy issimo Coffee drink. To my dismay, I didn't like it...at all. It's basically an iced, sweetened coffee drink around espresso strength. The drink had that stale, "I've been sitting for a while" coffee taste that is best poured down a drain. The sweetness is about right (not cloying or overpowering) and it definitely tastes like espresso, but it just doesn't taste like fresh brewed (maybe yesterday). I know it comes in a can and technically can't be fresh, but I've tasted similar coffee drinks that didn't have that stale, skunky taste. It gets two stars for giving a decent energy/caffeine boost, but the taste makes it impossible to recommend.

review/summary: Perfect for travel
review/text: It surprised me how tasty this drink actually is for being a canned coffee. It was actually really delicious!  This is especially handy to have on a road trip.  The coffee pots in motel rooms are shown to be anything but sanitary as one can imagine...it's not as though they have a dishwasher on that maid cart and sanitize those things.  That said, I'm not one to go without my morning coffee either and I hardly feel like driving around looking for a Starbucks in the morning (or even wanting to spend that on coffee if I found one.)<br /><br />Not that this couldn't be used for a daily coffee fix at home, but it's especially handy for the road; rather that be the road to work for easy car sipping, or--especially--the long road away from your home brewer.<br /><br />It's good to have a pack on hand for me for that reason alone.  While I'm happy with my home coffee, this adds a nice twist to change things up or to keep your caffeine buzz away from home as well.

review/summary: It Was Just OK and Not Very Special
review/text: I really like coffee, but overall I would rate this as "okay" tasting - it is very strong, and has a bit of a bite in the flavoring that made me get a piece of gum to get the taste out of my mouth.  After a couple of sips, I was done and would rate it a 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />I opened this can up in the office, and passed around small sampler cups to my co-workers to get their thoughts as I work with several coffee connoisseurs.  Three women and one man said they thought it was good, and the three women would rate it a 4 on a 5 scale while the man said he would rate it a 3..<br /><br />Another man who typically buys and enjoys the Starbucks canned beverages said he would rate it a 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Including myself, none of the test subjects hated it but everyone said the same thing - while they thought it was good, none of them believed it was "good enough" to make them want to go out and purchase some.  When I asked why, they had the same impression I had in that the coffee place downstairs was better none of us were really compelled to add this to our regular routines and shopping lists.<br /><br />One thing to note is there is a lot of sugar in this 6.4 ounce can: 10g!  The sugar and the caffeine combined should give you a little kick in the afternoon if that is what you are seeking.

review/summary: Surprisingly good!
review/text: I was bracing for this can of illy issimo coffee to contain a less-than-pleasant coffee experience, with a not-so-fresh, and overpoweringly strong-tasting coffee drink.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />The coffee contained within my little can had great, pure coffee flavor, with no "can taste". It wasn't overly sweet to me (although I DO like my coffee REALLY sweet. Like, "melted coffee ice cream" sweet...), and I was surprised to see that it looked to be just pure, brewed coffee - no cream added. I tend to brew my coffee pretty strong. Being a "single cup a day to wake me up first thing" kinda girl, I have a tendency to think that my daily cuppa Joe has to be beat-you-about-the-head powerful, and, recent changes in my taste have put that into question, as has this brew. It truly does taste like it was freshly brewed, then left to chill just long enough to give you the basis for a great cup of smooth, flavorful iced coffee, whether you choose to drink it straight, or gussy it up with a little flavored syrup and half-and-half (I opted for the latter).<br /><br />The previous can of illy issimo coffee that I'd tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> didn't really knock my socks off; I mean, it was good, but it wasn't the best I've ever tasted. I'd given that to Starbucks' Frappuccino line of refrigerated coffee drinks. But THIS can of issimo coffee drink really was good enough to give Starbucks a run for their money, for me, at least, especially considering that this brew doesn't contain anything more than coffee, a little sugar to sweeten it, and a few preservatives to hold it over (which any factory-made coffee drink will contain, anyway).<br /><br />If you're on the run, and, for some odd reason, aren't able to get yourself a cuppa Joe on the go, I definitely would recommend this drink for the true coffee purist. I'd be surprised if you weren't pleasantly surprised by it!

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised when I took my first sip of "illy issimo caffe: Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink." I'm not sure what I expected, but it certainly wasn't the wonderful taste of real espresso coffee from a can. I'm a skeptic and proud of it! My only quibble, and this is a matter of personal taste, I found this Coffee Drink to be very sweet. I am not a sweet guy, no matter what my wife says. I simply don't drink my coffee with sugar (real or artificial), nor do I put milk/cream in it. I love the raw jolt of plain espresso in the morning. This drink definitely has what I like...except for the 10g of sugar. The next time I try illy's caffe, I'll get the one with No Sugar added.<br /><br />O...as an aside, I poured the 6.8FL OZ (200ml) of illy's chilled espresso in a glass and held it up to the light. It was so dark, that no light, not even a ray of sunlight, shone through it. The color reminded me of Guinness Stout.  4 Stars (I had to take a star away because it was too sweet for me.)

review/text: I might as well review both Illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink & Illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink at the same time, since essentially the only difference is the additional lowfat milk and cocoa in the cappuccino. I am not a daily addict of high end espresso drinks, but I do have both espresso & cappuccino now and then - often Starbucks, but not exclusively. These Illy issimo coffee drinks have a distinctly nutty flavor - more distinctly so IMHO than the comparable Starbucks beverages. No real bitter edge, so for those who need that, this may not work out for you. Since this is so entirely a matter of taste and budget, I'll say I really like the taste but continue to roll my eyes at the prices - comparable to the Starbucks canned products you see at the grocery stores. For a quick pick-me-up treat, I'm all in, and I'd prefer this over the Starbucks stuff.

review/text: I was quite pleased with the flavor of this coffee energy drink. It has a creamy coffee flavor like a really good espresso. If you're in a hurry, with no time for making a coffee; and want a quality energy drink, look no further.

review/summary: A little too bitter
review/text: This flavor of Illy canned coffee I did not enjoy as much as the cappuccino flavor. The flavor was rather harsh and too bitter, and the caffeine jolt was unpleasantly over-the-top. I wouldn't buy this one again, but the cappucino flavor was much nicer and I recommend it instead.

review/summary: Starbucks needn't worry!
review/text: I'm a big fan of coffee, so this beverage piqued my interest.  I have tried Starbucks drinks both at Starbucks coffee shops and from the supermarket.  I like them.  This drink is not as sweet.  It seems there's just enough sugar to take the bitter edge off.  When ice is added it makes a refreshing enough warm weather beverage, though I have tasted better.  What the product has going for it is convenience.  The 6.8-ounce cans are easy to store in the refrigerator and can be taken out and drunk quickly.  No process of first making iced coffee.  That's a definite plus.  It is not as satisfying at room temperature.<br /><br />The flavor, apart from being strong, is harsh to the taste and does not provide the satisfaction that a Starbucks or other espresso drinks in a can/bottle do.  As a pick-me-up, the drink is appropriate, since its hefty dose of caffeine will give the drinker an infusion of energy.  Compared to other similar drinks on the market, sugar content is low (which accounts for its bitterness).<br /><br />For those averse to caffeine or those who have trouble sleeping if they drink too much brewed coffee, this beverage is a no-no.  These days, many folks have cut down on caffeine intake, so this product might be counterproductive to weaning oneself from addictive caffeine.

It is a nice pick me up and if you love a good strong coffee taste you'd probably love this.

review/summary: Sweet & good coffee flavor
review/text: I had recently tried the illy Cappuccino which had a slightly flat taste.  The Caffe flavor was a big improvement to me, with more sweetness and a richer coffee taste.  It wasn't the same flavor as I am used to from Starbucks but I liked the easy serving size which can be transported to drink anywhere.  The sweetness of this drink is just right, especially for those who don't drink coffee unsweetened.  I found the caffeine in the illy Caffe wasn't excessive and didn't make me too "wired" throughout the day.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: As a night worker, I'm always looking for a new beverage with 'zip' in it. Almost any coffee product will do. It helps, though, to be fully cognizant of what's in the can before you make expectations.<br /><br />While I guess I was thinking this was going to be another in the long line of Starbucks-type creamy and sweet coffee drinks, this is nothing of the kind. There is just enough sweet to take off the bitter, but this is very much an espresso-type drink - which, if I'd bothered to read the can, I would have realized.<br /><br />Good enough for what it was - and it did hike my alertness somewhat - it comes in a small can, nowhere near the size of even a regular canned coffee. The flavor was okay, but for what stuff goes for these days, the product could be a little more generous.

review/summary: It's ok
review/text: This review is based on a single can received from the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />I'm a coffee guy.  I drink it almost every day.  My coffee brewing method of choice is a French Press, and I like a rich full bodied coffee.  I do like iced coffee, and I like sweets, so this thing seemed like a good fit.<br /><br />I couldn't see anywhere on the can a recommendation on how to drink it, so I went with room temperature.  Big mistake.  This is definitely an iced coffee in a can, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />The coffee flavor was fine, but this was really sweet.  I drink sugary coffee with milk, but this doesn't have any milk or cream, so I didn't like it too much.  Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />If you like cold sweet coffee, without milk, you might want to give this a try.

review/text: I like a good strong coffee, but I did not enjoy this.<br />The flavor was strong and bitter, yet not very aromatic. It's acidic, a little sour to the tongue. The only way I can enjoy this is adding a lot of milk to it to mellow it out. Perhaps over a cup of ice.<br />On the bright side, it is not sweet, so you can customize your own sweetness.<br />I enjoyed the cappuccino flavor a lot more.

review/summary: Good
review/text: I like iced coffee on hot summer days but since those times are still a couple of months away, I poured the illy Caffe into my favorite coffee mug and microwaved it until it was just the right temperature for me. The can doesn't specify whether this is supposed to be a cold drink or a hot one, so I see no problem with doing this.<br /><br />I also must admit to being someone who only occasionally has espresso coffee, so keep that in mind when you evaluate my review.<br /><br />I liked it.<br /><br />The illy Caffe had a nice, strong coffee flavor. It was just a tad too sweet for me, but that could be a result of heating it rather than consuming it cold. We perceive sweetness differently depending upon temperature and as a cold drink the sweetness might be right. That seems to be the prevailing opinion in the other reviews here, so I'll defer to their judgement.<br /><br />I've tried another illy canned coffee drink, the Cappuccino, and I detected an under-taste of some sort in that one but that's not the case here. It has a nice espresso flavor with no off-flavor notes.<br /><br />The 6.8 ounce can contains 50 calories and 155 milligrams of caffeine.

review/text: I found myself in a situation where I had to be in three places at once, and I needed a flavorful boost without the hassle and cleanup of making my own espresso or the wait and expense of getting one at my local barrista.  Right there in front of me was a can of illy issimp Caffe coffee drink.  I popped the lid and took a sip.  This brew is dark, bold and bitter.  I added a packet of stevia-based sweetener and it was much more palatable.  My wife took a sip and we both agreed that we should order another pack of these.<br /><br />Bottom line - an enjoyable, high quality coffee drink.  It is not as sweet or decadent as a "double shot" can, but it taste more authentic.

review/text: For the record I'm not much of a coffee drinker.  When I go to Starbucks or McDonald's I prefer to get a mocha (especially a mocha frappe) because it's more like cocoa than coffee.<br /><br />So I guess what disappoints me about this product is that it's pretty much just a cup of coffee.  Despite that sugar is the second ingredient in it, the product really has a lot of that coffee bitterness in it.  If you're someone like me who doesn't like that, then this product certainly isn't for you.<br /><br />That is all.

review/summary: Now THAT hits the spot!
review/text: This is the second of the illy issimo Caffee drinks I've tried.  The first was a cappuchino chocolate drink that was tasty, but a little too sweet.  In fact it was sweet to the point of nearly bitter.<br /><br />My understanding is that the illy issimo line does actually come from an Italian coffee maker, but the brand itself is Coca Cola under license of the ILKO Coffee Intl company.  There is a split personality going on here...the can says Arabica coffee and finest ingredients of the quintessential Italian espresso experience.  But the can says product of Denmark that was apparently put together in Atlanta, GA.  The good news is that the apparently international effort of creating a can of this beverage is actually worthwhile!<br /><br />This one is really good...hit the spot perfectly.  There is a little sweetness to it, but its subdued and deep coffee taste.  In pouring, it looks like Jaegermeister (my admin asked if I was pouring Jaeger bombs).  it has an espresso like foam on the surface (which makes sense, it says Espresso Style on the can) and the smell was like a rich cold coffee.  The taste is easy and flavorful.  Unlike the first drink, I'll actually order a case of this one.  Really good.<br /><br />Pros:  Rich taste, works at room temperature (doesn't require ice) and can very much fulfill a caffeine fiend. But its only 50 calries, only 1% of which is sodium.<br /><br />Cons:  10g of sugar in the can (which is only a 6.8 fl oz (200 ml) can).  But the sugar barely registers.  I don't like sugar in my coffee, but I did like this.

review/summary: Basic coffee taste
review/text: This Illy "Italian Espresso Style" drink is one of an entire series of coffee-in-a-can style beverages.  This particular product has 6.8 fl oz and contains 155 mg of caffeine. That's pretty typical of a regular cup of coffee.<br /><br />The taste was pretty basic. In fact, it really just tastes like chilled coffee. It has that bitter coffee bite, somewhat toned down by sugar. It isn't too strong, but if you're looking for a smooth, milky taste then you won't like this drink. Overall, it was okay but certainly not my favorite. It'll do in a pinch as an iced coffee substitute, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it.

review/text: I am reviewing this just for the coffee flavor, which is excellent. It's a flavorful intense coffee flavor, but not too strong. Just right. There is no milk or creamer in this; it is essentially a black coffee drink. Since I like my coffee light, both hot and cold/iced coffee, I did add some half 'n half to this and the result was excellent. But if you don't drink your coffee light, then you'll probably like this right out of the can.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I tend to shy away from cold coffee drinks. I think this is mostly because I resisted coffee until I had to wake up in the morning at the Renaissance Festival and the caffeine was only so successful in waking me. I needed the heat to fully send me into an alert status (and it also became essential in the later weeks when there was frost on the ground and my teeth were rattling). I don't necessarily like the taste of coffee anymore than I like the taste of beer or scotch. I have developed a taste, but that is not the same as having a predisposed desire for it. It's a means to an end and if I am not warmed up in the first sip, that end is less forthcoming.<br /><br />I can honestly say that I enjoyed this beverage. It is just sweet enough to mitigate the coffee bitterness, but not so sweet that you don't know what it is. There is a smooth taste that belies the harshness of the coffee grounds. Furthermore, it is highly caffeinated to the point where my eyes were open wide and I was ready for work.<br /><br />I definitely will buy more.

review/summary: Delicious, But Too Rich, Kaffe Drink
review/text: If you like your Italian espresso to be very dark and bold in taste, then you can't miss with Illy Issimo Caffe . Like its "cousin", Illy Issimo Cappucino, this is an exceedingly rich Italian espresso style coffee drink, but it isn't nearly as rich as the cappuccino, which I have tried recently. However, I thought the coffee flavor was still rich and decided that it needed some improvement by diluting it 50% with fresh milk. I am surprised that a drink as rich as this one is has only 50 calories per can; it's also low sodium too with only 20 milligrams per can. Anyone who is diet conscious will appreciate both salient facts. While I can recommend this to anyone who wants an imported Italian espresso drink from Europe (Denmark), those seeking freshly ground beans, will find Starbucks' version a far more delicious coffee drinking experience.

review/text: I love espresso.  When I heard about this product I felt like I had to try it, even though part of me wondered (and still wonders) whether there is really a market for espresso in a can.  It tastes really good, rich and full-bodied, with just enough sweetness.  If you ever feel like a shot of iced espresso would go down good right now, this would be the product for you.<br /><br />This is a Coca Cola product.  I was one of the 5 people who thought Coca Cola Black (coffee flavored Coke) was a great product back in the 2000's.  Apparently Coke hasn't given up on capturing a portion of the coffee-lovers market.  The ingredient list is short and sweet and consists of what the illy issimo website calls "ingredients of natural origin" - primarily coffee and sugar.  Although it tastes really good, I just can't imagine getting addicted to this stuff, mainly because when I think espresso, I think of a hot drink.  It just seems like people's mind sets would need to undergo a radical change in order for this product to be successful.

review/summary: Good coffee drink
review/text: This coffee drink is made in Denmark and imported to be sold by Coca-Cola.  Its ingredient list is short and pretty non-offensive, coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate.  The can is labeled as "no preservatives," so I'm not sure of the reason for the last ingredient.<br /><br />The taste is like a sweet high quality coffee.  IT claims to be an "Italian espresso style coffee" and I suppose it is- although I'm not an expert.  That's about it- no milk or cream taste, but good coffee.  If you like cold, sweet coffee you should like it.<br /><br />The drink contains 155 mg of caffeine, so it's about as strong as your average energy drink or high end cup of coffee.  It contains 50 calories, so it's fairly light in that department, being that it doesn't use artificial sweeteners.

This only has 50 calories, so if you are on a diet, this will fit in with your goals.<br /><br />Tastes great- convenient, small cans.  Perfect to take to work with you, or as you travel in your car.<br /><br />I will defintely buy this product again.

review/summary: Handy Coffee Drink
review/text: This would be a good coffee drink to have on hand.  I did chill it in the refrigerator, and since I don't drink espresso with sugar, I placed this in a cup and added a bit of milk, and liked it better that way.  The milk softened the sugar taste a bit and the bitterness of the espresso.  All in all, a nice beverage.

review/summary: If It Weren't For the Can....
review/text: ...I'd give this five stars. I very much like coffee but I don't typically consume espresso drinks because I find many of them too strong or overly bitter. However, I immensely enjoyed illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink. It is smooth with just a mildly strong and flavorable after-taste. It's the sort of drink you can sit, sip on and savor. The only downside is the terrible metallic taste that comes from pressing your lips against the can, but that's easily solvable by pouring the drink into another cup. Also, the drink gives a powerful caffeine kick if you're looking for a pick me up.<br /><br />If you love coffee and enjoy espresso drinks I highly recommend that you give illy issimo Caffe Coffee drink a try!

review/summary: Danish Coffee from Coca Cola
review/text: Well, there aren't a lot of chemicals (or ingredients) in this product; coffee, sugar and potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate.  However, this is a small note that the product also may have traces of milk in it.  There are 50 calories (6.8 fluid oz.); so it isn't overly sweet or tart.  It doesn't have an overly strong coffee flavor, but I think it tastes best either very, very cold, or hot.  I drank one that was cold (about 45 degrees F), and it wasn't all that good.  However, in a pinch, it does give you a decent caffeine jolt (155 mg. per can), and it is easy to open and consume.  Personally, I like the sweeter drinks sweetened with milk, but this one isn't bad.

review/text: illy issimo Caffe Coffee is a wonderful drink. If you are tired of the same old Starbucks routine grab a little taste of Rome with this great concoction. I pour mine over ice and love it. This is for the coffee drinker. If you are not a big fan of coffee I would skip this product.

review/summary: Not Too Sweet
review/text: Generally, I'm a fan of canned coffee drinks - so I'm predisposed to liking most of the ones I try. That being said, the most common weakness of canned coffee drinks is too many of them can be much too sweet so as not to be enjoyable. Illy does a good job of making a light, refreshing coffee drink that is lightly sweetened. There is only 50 calories per can so it isn't too sinful if you are trying to watch your calorie intake.<br /><br />My only quibble is that while the coffee flavor is good, it isn't very strong - this is more like a Dunkin Donut's style coffee than a Starbucks style coffee. If I saw this can available in a store, I'd definitely get it again.

review/summary: Wow that was strong!
review/text: My first sip really surprised me and I think my face said it all: Strong was written all over my face. I wasn't expecting the taste to be as rich as it was, but honestly with just the first sip I wasn't sure if I liked it. But as I continues to sip I started to enjoy the rich bold taste and could really feel the Italian espresso working it's way through my morning sleepy head. By the time I had the last sip I was awake and my mind was alert and I honestly felt more awake then I normally feel when I drink my other cold instant canned coffee. And illy issimo is only 50 calories and only 20mg sodium which makes my other coffee look like is has tons of calories when I compare the two of them. I normally drink Trader Joe's with it's 120 calories and sometimes I feel like I need 2 of them just to wake up in the morning, but with illy issimo 1 can was all I needed and I was awake. With the difference in calories and how well it worked I think it might be time I thought about switching coffee brands.

review/summary: A Good Balance Between Flavor and Sweetness
review/text: It has been a long time since I have had brewed (but not necessarily fresh) coffee out of a can.  Having been exposed to a range of canned coffees in Japan, where, I might add, it is something of a staple among salaried workers and nearly approaches the status of being its own food group, just like instant ramen, I have to admit that I had a few reservations about the product, given that some products in this category hit and others miss, quite often by more than a mile.<br /><br />I can confidently say that the Illy Issimo Caffe Coffee Drink definitely hits the target.  The coffee comes slightly sweetened (with sugar being the sweetener) and has a good texture.  The drink itself is sweet, but not syrupy, and is heavy on flavor, with a pleasant after-taste.  Its aroma is understated, and the coffee tends not to be very pungent, which I found most peculiar given that the product uses only arabica beans.  From the standpoint of caffeine content, I would say that there is a fair quantity here to develop a modest and sustainable "buzz" (readers should understand that, given my 8-cup-a-day coffee habit, my comments on caffeine content are highly suspect).<br /><br />Although I can't say for certain from where the coffee was sourced, both its strength and its aroma would tend to suggest a Central- or South-American origin (and I freely admit that I could be totally wrong here).  Unfortunately, I had only one can of this delightful treat, and if I had a spare can, I would have given it to our resident coffee-snob at work (who, by the way, roasts her own, carefully and elaborately sourced green beans) and much like a sommelier, she could have told me whether or not it was a specialty coffee or just commodity coffee, its probable point of origin and even its terrior.  But I (totally) digress.<br /><br />I had this coffee cold, and I placed it in the fridge for about twelve hours before consuming it.  Indeed, I think it best to serve this particular product cold, as the flavor components and aroma may quickly volatilize (that is, disappear by evaporation) if consumed warm or hot.<br /><br />Overall, the Illy Issimo Caffe Coffee Drink represents a good balance between flavor and sweetness.  Those of you looking for a quick pick-me-up in the afternoon will do well with this product, and those of who like a good, sipping coffee served cold will do even better with it.

review/summary: stronger flavor and less sweet than many other canned/bottled coffees
review/text: While I did enjoy illy's issimo caffe coffee drink, I do have mixed feelings about it.  The good, from my perspective, is that it's less sweet than all of the other alternative canned/bottled coffee drinks I've had, so it tastes more like slightly sweetened, strong coffee rather than very sweet milk with a little coffee flavor mixed in.  That being said, the product is labeled that it's "espresso style" and I think that's probably an overstatement.  Yes, this product has a strong coffee flavor, but it tastes more like a very strong brewed coffee versus a well pulled espresso shot.<br /><br />Given that I generally drink my coffee unsweetened, whether hold or cold, I don't think I would purchase this product regularly.  If you do like strong, cold coffee that's slightly sweetened, this product might be more to your liking than mine.  I'm still rating it 4 ("I like it") versus 3 ("It's okay") stars because I think the product is better than okay and is certainly good for what it is.  If a half star were possible, my personal rating would certainly be 3.5 stars.

review/summary: Great, if you like cold, sweetened coffee.
review/text: This is the best of its kind I have tried: a prepared coffee beverage. It isn't too acidic, and has a nice rich coffee flavor. It is, of course, not hot unless you leave it in the car or heat it up somehow (Starbucks had some deal that was self-heating a while back, but I think it is no longer available.) It is not overly sweet, but is somewhat so--it has 50 calories, so that's a couple of teaspoons of sugar. I would prefer an unsweetened option, but this is not too much. You could easily make iced coffee with this--it has enough flavor to hold up to some dilution from the ice and could be pre-chilled to reduce that even further.<br /><br />Good stuff.

review/summary: Quality Italian espresso on the go
review/text: It's dark and bold like others have said, but that's to be expected from espresso in a can. What I didn't expect, was for it to taste pretty good for what it is. In all fairness, I'm not a big coffee drinker. I don't normally drink plain black coffee or espresso, and tend to prefer a cappuccino or mochaccino or, barring that, a cup of coffee with a healthy dose of cream and sugar. This isn't exactly a drink for me, but even for me this wasn't unpleasant by any means. It has a rich flavor to it--what I'd expect from quality coffee--with a subtle hint of sugar that works really well. I have no doubt espresso lovers will enjoy this and I'm impressed enough by this that I'm confident I'll really enjoy illy issimo's other coffee drinks, such as the mochaccino (which is probably a better fit for a coffee drinker like me).

review/text: This coffee tastes very good.  I heated mine in a mug but it would be good over ice too.  Because it is very sweet I would not want to start every day with it but as a treat it's great.  By my calculations there is about a tablespoon of sugar in each 6.8 ounce can.  Cans are aluminum which is appreciated since that is the only substance I can recycle here.

review/summary: True Expresso Flavor
review/text: This little can (6.8 oz.)of coffee drink has the flavor of espresso with a not-too-sweet note.  There is nothing artificial-tasting about it, as is often found in other energy boost drinks.  With 155 mg. of caffeine, it contains almost double the jolt in a 7 oz. brewed cup of coffee.  This one's not for sissies.<br /><br />Please note that, with 10 grams of sugar and 12 grams of carbohydrate, it may not be for those on sugar/carbohydrate restricted intake. Other than that, it contains nothing to deem it unhealthy.  It even has no preservatives. (I wonder what this drink might taste like if it were artificially sweetened and have no carbohydrates.)<br /><br />I enjoyed it ice cold straight from the can.  This tastes every bit as good as the Starbucks bottled coffee drinks.  I would not hesitate to choose the Illy brand over the other one.<br /><br />Coca Cola produces it in Atlanta, Georgia under a licensing agreement and it is a product of Denmark.

review/summary: Rich Flavor, Low Calories
review/text: Lately I've been really getting into espresso, and this small espresso-based energy drink comes as close to the taste of the real thing as is possible for a drink of this kind. It's very light (only 10g of sugars, no fat, no dairy and only 50 calories), and it's very bitter as compared to some other similar beverages. For instance, the 6.5 ounce can of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BZODI">Starbucks DoubleShot</a> contains 17g of sugar, 6g of fat, and 140 calories. Even the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005W4AF3G">Starbucks Doubleshot Light</a> has 6g of sugar, 4g of fat and 70 calories. In terms of caffeine per serving, illy's espresso drink has about 155 mg as opposed to 130 for the Sturbucks drinks.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: if you want a strong, light, European-style espresso drink than illy's issimo is a great choice. However, if you enjoy smoother, more filling taste then check out the Starbucks' DoubleShots.

review/summary: Closest to the Real Thing
review/text: I'm presuming that one would only resort to canned coffee if there weren't any real coffee available- that's the basis on which I will review this drink.  I still prefer the real thing, but for a canned coffee, this really is not bad.  It's nice and strong, and it has less sugar than other coffee drinks.  I'd actually prefer even less sweetener, but I find myself to be a bit unusual in that.  In any case, this is the closest ready-made beverage I've found that tastes like real espresso.  I can definitely appreciate the convenience.

review/summary: The worst thing I've ever tasted
review/text: 1. I am purposely writing this review blind of the other reviews.  If I am the only 1 star then consider I must have got a bad can.  That or &lt;1% of the population has a gene incompatible with this recipe :-)<br /><br />2. Is "worst thing" hyperbolic.. maybe.  I remember when I was five I tried tasting some strawberry air freshener, that was pretty bad.  Among intended foodstuffs, this does indeed rank up there with worst<br /><br />3. The ingredients are coffee, sugar, and preservative, so I am not sure how it has gone wrong.  For one thing it tastes slightly carbonated/citric... likely the preservative.  And the sweetness is just way off.  Too high and totally unbalanced with the coffee.  The coffee has a weird mouth-feel.  Ever accidentally sipped form a cup of coffee on your desk only to realize it was from 3 days ago?  Sort of like that.<br /><br />If it helpful to know, I am a coffee drinker.  My general drinks of choice are double-short-americano or triple-tall-cappucino

review/summary: Convenient small can of espresso drink
review/text: I enjoy just about any coffee, and I liked the illy issimo caffe Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink too.  It does have a bit of a bitter taste, even though the ingredients include sugar.  So it's not a real sweet drink.  I liked the strong, somewhat bitter taste of it, even though my favorite coffee drinks are mocha style beverages (both hot and cold).<br /><br />I refrigerated the can before drinking, and it was a nice quick cold coffee beverage.  However, I am used to drinking large cups of coffee, so the small 6.8 oz. can seemed too small, and I finished it off pretty quick.  The nice thing about the small can is you can take these with you just about anywhere.  So they are very convenient.<br /><br />I'd recommend to people who like iced espresso style coffee drinks that have a bit of sweetness, but remain a bit bitter and who want very convenient small servings that can be taken just about anywhere.

I don't really enjoy my coffee with sugar in it, but I think if illy issimo would come out with a full-bodied espresso drink that has no sweetener whatsoever in it, suitable for using in place of pulled espresso shots for making one's own lattes or for splitting a can in espresso cups, that would be a hit and would be something I might buy to have on hand to serve to guests.

The few times I have had canned coffee (I generally avoid packaged processed foods) it has tasted oily, as that is what "non-dairy creamer" is, oil, and the coffee itself was pretty nasty.<br />  This coffee, however, is made by a coffee company, and a European gourmet coffee company at that.  They know coffee, how to choose, roast and brew it.  It is smooth coffee, lightly sweetened, and *without high fructose corn syrup* :)  When I am on the road I generally look for bottled water.  If that isn't available I get lemonade or juice, choosing canned coffee (or a water fountain) if none of the above is available (I just will not consume most of the additives in canned drinks).  This particular coffee, I would bump up in that line, as it is actually more wholesome than most of the packaged lemonade, for example.<br /><br />I would also describe this more as a medium roast, and am surprised, given that they drink pretty sturdy coffee in Italy, that the company describes it as an espresso.  It may be that it is prepared with an espresso roast?  But it is definitely milder than what most people would describe as espresso.  It is, however, reasonably good coffee, prepared with entirely natural ingredients, and that in itself is almost revelatory!

review/summary: Not very good
review/text: Other than the benefit of caffeine, this really is not a very good drink.  If you compare it to other competitors (namely the at-home Starbucks drinks), it's vastly inferior in just about every category.  The taste is mediocre and not pleasant.  The smell keeps its metallic odor even after pouring it into a different glass.  The value isn't there, either.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very disappointing drink.
