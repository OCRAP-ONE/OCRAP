review/summary: Bitter surprise
review/text: I have enjoyed Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed for three years.  But I just received a three pound bag that was puffed up with air.  When I opened it up, it still smelled like hemp seed so I took a bite and swallowed it.  Not only did it taste bitter, but it burned my throat!  Amazon is refunding my money and I am going to try a different brand of hemp seed.  I suspect improper packaging or storage which is a shame because Nutiva's product is really good when it is fresh.

review/summary: Not good anymore
review/text: I ordered this product based on good reviews like 2 months ago and i really loved it and I ordered another 3 pound bag a month later, the second bag was just not right, I thought i must be a bad batch or something because it had more green shells in it and the seeds looked more brownish, it had this bitter burning taste. I called amazon and they said they would send me another ( i really did not wanna give up on it so i wanted to try another), same thing. I called again and they said they would send me another just to make sure that it was not a fluke. I got the bag 2 days ago and the same thing :(  finally i gave up on it. I will look in to another brand. I am really curious if other people are having the same issue..

review/summary: Maybe not for everyone
review/text: I put a heaping teaspoon of this product on my usual cereal (Nature's Path Heritage) and skim milk -- got really bad diarrhea for the next two days.<br /><br />I also tried the Nutiva's chocolate HempShake and I loved the taste of that -- I added about 8 oz of skim milk.  Seemed agreeable for two days, then on the third day the combination gave me several hours of rotten-egg flatulence like I have never experienced in my life.  Again, I had skim milk and hemp together in combination.<br /><br />Too early to say it's the hemp, might be the combination -- maybe hemp creates a digestive environment where the milk is indigestible. Usually I can eat just about anything so I was very surprised.  I'll give it another try someday...<br /><br />If anyone has any insight, please feel free to comment.

review/summary: Not for Everyone
review/text: This product sounded so great. I started taking about two to four tbls. a day. After a week my lips started swelling, then the inside of my mouth started feeling strange and my tongue was very sensitive, then I started having what I thought was heartburn (which i never get) I would feel pressure in my thoart all the way down to my Solar plexis, By the end of the second week it became so intense I knew something was wrong with me, I just didn't know what. I thought "I"m having an allergic reaction"(I'm not allergic to anything) so it took me awhile to catch on, the only new thing I added to my diet was the hemp hearts. I quite taking them, in one day  I started feeling better, by two days, started feeling normal again.<br />So just be careful, people can have an allergic reaction to this.

review/summary: Wound up at the ER
review/text: I won't go all the way to 1-star since this is probably more about me and not the foodstuff but, despite the claim that hemp seeds are not known to contain allergens, I did experience *some kind* of reaction to 4 tbsp of this stuff this past Monday, about 4 hours after ingesting it. I passed out, was shaking uncontrollably when I came to, felt tingling followed by a loss of sensation, nausea, pain, and shortness of breath. I realize correlation does not prove causation, but the health professionals whom I've consulted so far (which includes my primary) agree that there's a strong possibility that the episode was caused by something in the hemp seed, especially since I do not have a history of these kinds of incidents. I'm going for tests anyhow, and if it turns out that the hemp seed was not implicated, I'll update my review.<br /><br />Still, the moral of the story is, try just a little bit of this and any novel food or remedy before you take a full serving of it, lest you wind up at the ER like I did.

review/summary: Strange Label
review/text: I was ready to buy these seeds and I figured I would see what Nutiva actually charges.  $54.99!  BUT the packaging is different.  Why does Amazon sell the same product with different labelling?  Is it actually the same product or are you paying less for a cheaper version?  Just a question that should be raised since companies are in the habit of caring about their bottom lines over our bodies.

review/summary: Love the Hemp!
review/text: I really enjoy the hemp hearts. I have come to crave them. I am always looking for a good deal and this is indeed a great price for the qty. These come to abt 3 to 5 dollars less per lb. than what I can get locally. If I use auto ship it is 5 to 7 dollars less. My only complaint is the hulls of the 3 brands I have tried this has by far the most hulls and the only one with intact seeds. I doesn't take much to de-hull them but, it is time consuming. I realize "hulls are a good source of fiber" but, my teeth do not agree. I am tempted to pay a little more for less. If this is something that doesn't bother you I urge you to get it.

review/summary: Lucky me!
review/text: Sometimes health discoveries, (wonders), are simply amazing.  Hemp seeds are helping me turn my health around because I'm nurturing my cells.  How I know is because I don't crave or binge on junk food and sugars like before, as well as "diet" products, and I no longer feel like I'm starving. This became forefront to looking for real food, other nutrition<br />"secrets" and, basically, gave me motivation to come out of a slump I was<br />in while not looking after my health like I should have been.  A good friend threw me this life-line which I gladly pass on.  Amazon.com had the best price with the free shipping so I'm sticking with good people, and powerful nutrition.  My overall health is only getting better day by day, and a good outlook itself becomes good medicine.  Do the research, you'll be amazed.  Lucky you for discovering hemp seeds.  A. prouty

review/summary: Essential!
review/text: We have been eating hempseeds for sometime - they are an essential part of our diet.  I genuinely notice a difference physically when I eat them along.  This is a good price and we have gotten good quality from Amazon.  PLEASE SHARE SOME WITH YOUR FRIENDS!!<br /><br />We must work together to make this available to the USA INCLUDING the farmers.  We live under an oppressive, authoritarian regime which, only a few years ago, would have attacked you for eating what is literally "birdseed".  Wild!<br /><br />2nd Review w/Suspcription Purchase Method<br />We have been delighted to have hemp seed finally taken off Schedule 1 Controlled Substance (along with heroin, etc.).  I know that is insane to even write this but that is the nature of the degenerate and immoral drug policy barons from the DEA and ONDCP - to twist reality and prohibit what are supposed to be free American citizens from obtaining some of the best food known to mankind beause their pseudo fear of people smoking flowers(and then engaging in violence against these same peaceful, free human beings).  NUTS indeed!!<br /><br />In any event, we have started using the suscription method.  This is a great price compared to anywhere else that I have found.  It actually takes 4 mos for us to go through 5 lbs.  Therefore, I signed up for 2 mos and simply skip one.  I will give very great KUDOS to Amazon for how they have set this up - at least for this product, both the product and the system work great!<br /><br />Greg Logan

review/summary: Inconsistent at best - too many hulls
review/text: I enjoy hempseed, primarily I sprinkle it over my salads to add a nutty and nutritious component.<br />I like buying this in bulk because it saves money over the expensive 1 pound or half-pound  bags I can get at the store.<br />My complaint about this product is that you never know what you'll get. Sometimes it's fairly free of hulls (seed coats) and sometime it's just full of them<br />And they're hard to deal with - very hard pieces of shells that interfere with the enjoyment of whatever you are eating.<br />I guess you could spend time separating the pieces out, but that is a labor-intensive process and at that point it becomes more economical (time is money) to buy the 1 pound or half-pound bag at the store from a company that pays more attention to what they are packaging.<br />I kust got a new shipment and it is absolutely full of seed coat fragments.<br />Grrrrr....

I buy it on "Subscribe and Save" program, getting 5 lb. every six months and enjoying sizeable discounts. It makes up a part of my regular lunch consisting of an apple, a banana, and a mixture of sunflower, pumpkin, and hemp seeds (1/4 of cup each). The apple a day definitely keeps a doctor away (to my delight), and the seeds provide a close to perfect combination of "right" protein and fatty acids. Pumpkin seeds also keep my prostate healthy, which is important in my age. Hemp seeds give the mixture the additional taste and flavor.

review/summary: Nutritional delight
review/text: I've purchased Nutiva hemp seed many times over the last year, and so far it has been delivered fresh and good tasting. Be aware that it turns rancid quickly and needs refrigeration. I use it to make hemp seed milk. I find this to be the most efficent and effective use of the product. I blend 1 cup of hemp seed, 3 cups of distilled  water, a small amount of kelp powder, and 3 pitted medjool dates, that have been soaked overnight, in my Blendtec blender. I then strain it through a nut milk bag. The blending is so complete that the only thing left in the bag are a few hard shells left over from Nutiva's mechanical processing and small amount of fiber. The Nutiva processing is pure mechanical and kept under 104 degrees F. They then store it under 40 degrees F. The plastic shipping bag is vacuum sealed. Hemp seed is a nutritionally complete food. It has all of the essential amino and fatty acids. 3 tbsp. supply 11g of protein. In order to keep it fresh I store it in a plastic tub in my freezer.

review/summary: New to eating hempseeds
review/text: After reading about all the health benefits of hempseeds, I went ahead and bought this 5-pound bag of them even though I've never eaten them before (coming from an islander culture, I was always taught to learn about and respect the healing qualities of various foods). Another reviewer here said that these hempseeds taste like raw pine nuts, and I would agree with that. Nutiva's hempseeds are delicious; they taste fresh, and I love their texture: they're soft like pine nuts, small like quinoa or couscous, and mild in flavour with a tiny bit of sweetness. As I type this review, I'm eating them with a spoon; it's good to eat even by itself. I'm very glad I got the 5-pound bag (with repeat delivery every three months), because I will happily incorporate hempseeds into my daily eating habits. I want to pour this over all my meals now; I may finish this big bag before month's end. If you're even a little bit curious if hempseeds are right for you, I'd recommend getting some and trying them out -- you may discover another superfood that you actually like. If not, then at least you had the experience of tasting something different.

I don't know if this is normal. I keep a small amount in the fridge for several weeks use, in a mason jar, the rest in the freezer. I usually mix them in smoothies, and didn't try them alone until just now for the purpose of this review. The taste is nutty, I don't detect any rancid taste... just the smell that makes me inclined to stop using them. I read that hemp seeds go rancid like an hour after being hulled.

review/text: I have been eating Hemp Seed Hearts for breakfast since Aug. 15, 2011. I love them!! I've lost 15 pounds because my appetite is significantly reduced and my energy level is great. I eat a big salad in the morning with 2oz. Hemp Seeds, with plain yogurt and Mrs. Dash spices. Since August, I've not had a salad in the AM about 6 times. After a weekend of eating like a 'normal person', I can't wait until I can go back to eating my salad for breakfast. My acid reflux is GONE, I'm no longer bloated and gassy. Hemp Seeds are full of nutrition and I plan to eat them for the rest of my life (I'm 52).

review/text: I'm very happy with the shipment of Nutiva hempseeds. They arrived fast, and were vacuum packed, which preserves their freshness. Nutiva's hempseeds are high quality. And vacuum packed nuts and seeds are the best!  I will order these again, when I run out, and I have recommended them to family and friends. Hempseeds are very nutritionally dense and make a great addition to smoothies and salads. I have a nice tabouli recipe for hempseeds in my Little e-Book of Raw Holiday Recipes.

review/summary: HORRIBLE STOMACH PAIN!!
review/text: I have Celiac Disease and heard so much good stuff about Hemp Seeds.  I purchased this 3lb. bag and was excited to try it.  The first time I became very nauseous and I did not connect it to the Hemp Seeds.  The next time I sprinkled it on my salad.  Approximately two hours later I got horrible stomach cramps and uncontrollable vomiting.  It was so awful!  I was in pain the whole night.  I was afraid to eat anything the next day.  I just had Gatorade and a banana.  I don't think I could ever try Hemp Seeds again.  I don't know if this was a bad batch or if they share equipment with a wheat facility. I will never buy this again.

review/text: This is a great product and I highly suggest it.  It's the best price you will find for a quality product.  I was buying the trader joes hemp powder protein mix but when I found this I switched.  This has more protein, less sugar, less calories and less fiber, it was a no brainer.  More expensive but worth it.  Its great to mix in any smoothie for a little more protein.  Hemp is the best possible protein you can get.  I recently started to make hemp milk with this and its great.  The recipe is simple: 4 cups of filtered waters, 3/4 of cups of the hemp seeds, put into a highpowered blender until white and creamy.  Its delicious!

review/summary: Healthiest addition ever
review/text: I absolutely love these hemp seeds. They come vacuum-sealed and I just transfer them to a large freezer bag when I open them, and store them in the freezer.<br /><br />Hemp seeds are a perfect protein, supplying your body with all the essential amino acids. In just 3 tablespoons of these seeds, you're getting 11 grams of protein! They are also super high in other minerals and vitamins, as well as omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />We sprinkle these on just about anything - oatmeal, yogurt, pizza, you name it. I mix them in with all types of food for my now 15 month old son. They are SO good for babies and young children with all the omega-3 fatty acids, protein, minerals.<br /><br />I subscribe to this item and only pay $50 with free shipping - can't beat the price for such a healthy item.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I really enjoy these hemp seeds on salads.  They have a slightly nutty flavor, so it is a perfect compliment to a crisp, dark green salad.  One word of warning, though, toss the salad well, and sprinkle the seeds on after you put your dressing on your salad.  The reason is because I once put them on my salad before the dressing and I ate a large cluster of seeds in one bite, and they got caught in my throat.  I coughed a bit and was fine, but it was something that could've been avoided.<br /><br />I highly recommend these little seeds as a dietary supplement for the omega-3's and 6's.  NEVER, EVER heat them or cook with them, or they will lose their nutritional value completely.  No hyperbole, just fact.

review/summary: I like its pine nutty taste
review/text: Hempseed flavor reminds me of pine nuts.  Hempseed contain all nine essential amino acids, which makes them a complete protein, like egg whites and soy. One ounce of hemp provides 45 percent of daily magnesium requirement. Studies show that a diet rich in magnesium can slash diabetes risk by almost half, because it increases insulin sensitivity.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat hempseed is as a dip or a spread on a sandwich.  I use the same recipe for both.  I puree 1 Tbsp. ground hemp seeds, 2 Tbsp. store-bought pesto, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and 1 can cannellini beans.<br /><br />Hempseed are easy to spill from the plastic bag they arrive in, so when I am ready to use a new bag I pour the bag into a plastic container designed for cereal, this allows me to pour the seeds out of the container's spout without spilling the seeds on the counter. To make it easier to move the content of the bag into the container, I cut a small hole in the bag and use a funnel to direct the seeds into the container.<br /><br />In case you find it useful here is a taste comparison of other seeds I use in my diet.<br /><br />FLAXSEEDS<br />Nutty-flavored seeds that provide the most nutrition when ground.<br /><br />HEMP SEEDS<br />Similar in taste to sunflower seeds and pine nuts.<br /><br />BUCKWHEAT GROATS<br />Soft seeds with a sweet, earthy flavor when toasted.<br /><br />WHEAT GERM<br />The flaky center of wheat kernels. Very light earthy flavor.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

My most recent order, however, while still received promptly, was rancid and inedible. I was so disappointed. I sent an email that evening, detailing my concern and asking for a new shipment. I didn't receive a reply to my email. What I did receive, however, was a new order of Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed, delivered to my doorstep just two days later! Since this new seed had the same packaging date as my initial order, I cautiously sampled it. The seeds were fine. Phew! So -- not only do I have a good supply of a good product, I got excellent service from Amazon!  Thank you!

review/text: It's my first time trying hempseed and I'm amazed. You can eat directly from the bag! It has a texture similar to cooked couscous (soft and smooth.) It tastes like sun flower or pumpkin seed. It has a light omega-3 fishy oil after taste. Just when I have a thought of going to supermarket getting some ribs to do slow BBQ, I just tried four spoons of hempseed and my craving for soft tender ribs disappear in my head. So I guess it has all the needed stuff you can get from tasty meat with less required cooking time. So Nutiva hempseed is pretty fresh based on the taste and texture of the seeds. My bag was packaged 45 days ago. I separate 1/4 lbs into a smaller ziplock bag leaving in the fridge and the rest went to a bigger ziplock in the freezer.

review/summary: My New Food Addiction
review/text: I started adding these to my diet after reading about the paleo(caveman) diet and the anti-candida diet. I read these hempseeds control the sugar and carb cravings for those who follow those diets. Although I am not on the paleo diet or the anti-candida diet; I am eating mostly meats, fish, vegetables, fruits and nuts. These seeds are appetite filling and do control food cravings for sugars and starches.  Many times I will just eat a spoonful. I also add them to home-made smoothies and yogurt. These hempseeds taste similar to sunflower seeds, which I also love eating by the way.<br /><br />I will most likely be a customer for life.

I can understand how a 3# package can last quite a long time although I do use it to make milk in my soymilk maker http://www.amazon.com/Soyapower-Plus-Milk-Maker-Rice/dp/B001KT61P8/ref=sr_1_cc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1298166499&sr=1-1-catcorr which eats it up pretty fast..so to speak : ))  but thats what it's for so...<br />I can't say enough good things about this product. It's always been delivered fast and always comes very fresh tasting in it's vacuumed sealed package.

review/text: 6/5 stars for the seeds, 1 star for the seller (false advertising).<br />I bought the 3lb version that had the resealable bag as pictured, paid the extra money for it, and still received the cheaper bulk transparent bag version... Was looking to conceal freshness, but just ended up overpaying, and the shipping was very much delayed.

review/summary: love the hemp seeds
review/text: I am a new convert to the hemp seeds.  They taste delicious raw.  I eat them right out of the bag.  They look similar to sesame seeds, but taste more like raw pine nuts.  I also like the fact that they are higher in Omega 3's and have more protein than the chia seeds I had been using.  Nutiva has the best price for the amount I purchased.

review/text: These hemp seed are very good tasting. They are kind of nutty yet buttery in the same sense. These are very good for you also. Since they are small you can mix them in about everything like salads, shakes, put them on eggs, just about anything. I enjoy these very much and would recommend them to anyone who likes healthy natural foods.

review/summary: Quite a surprise!
review/text: This hemp seed reminds me of finely chopped black walnuts in appearance and to my taste buds, it has a much milder black walnut taste. I really did not know what to expect for a nutty flavor, but was pleasantly surprised. I plan to use them as a nut substitute when I make banana bread. I was concerned since we were having such warm weather this past week that they would turn rancid during shipping, but they arrived fully sealed, fresh tasting, and thus far I have no shell complaint. I have also started using Nutiva's organic hemp oil for salad dressings and Pacific' hemp milk to decrease my use of diary. All products have proven enjoyable winners.

review/summary: horrible product
review/text: This hemp seed made me and my family extremely ill.<br /><br />I ordered the 3 lb bag. I do not know if this was a fluke or just a bad batch but this was TERRIBLE<br /><br />I received the product in great time. It arrived in about 3 or 4 days and i gave half of the bag to my daughter. I used hemp seed mostly in my protein shakes. I've been taking hemp seed for about 4 months now. When I got this product, i used it in one of my shakes and 2 hours later I had horrible stomach pain and threw everything up. My stomach continued to feel horrible all day. I really didn't even think it was the shake, but a stomach virus at the time. Then 3 days later, my daughter called me and told me she got very sick, with similar symptoms. She had mentioned that it was a couple hours after drinking a shake she made with the hemp seed. At that point I was afraid to use to product, unsure if it was the hemp seed or my family had gotten a "bug" (by the way, my daughter does not live at home). So a month just passed and today I decided to give it another try. I made a shake and put 2 tablespoons of hemp seed in it (the recommended dosage is 3 but i only use 2 in my shakes). And then, like clockwork, 2 hours later i threw everything up and my stomach still feels horrible and i still feel nauseous. The expiration date of this product is December of 2012 so its not expired but there has to be something wrong with it.  To date, we've used about 6 tablespoons of this stuff and we haven't thrown the rest away in hopes the company will contact us and want it back for testing and give us a refund. I'm not saying the company acted maliciously but I do believe this may have been a bad/tainted batch.

review/text: We always order organic shelled hemp seeds from Nutiva and we love them but the last order we received was horrible.  There were a ton of shells mixed in with the product which made it very bitter and hard to eat.  I don't know if Nutiva is using a different process to remove the shells or if this was just a bad batch.  We are going order a new bag; if it is the same we will have to find a different vendor to order from.  Had this been our first purchase we would have just assumed that this is how the product is and would never have ordered again.

review/text: This is a super food make no mistake about it. It is high in antioxidants, hight in essential omega fatty acids, and high in easily digestible plant protien. A tablespoon of this on your yogurt, cereal, smoothie, or stir fry will go a long way. I eat them by the spoonfull and would equate it to eating sesame seeds. They say that when the buddah was fasting he survived on just one hemp seed a day.<br /><br />These seeds do not have THC as hemp is a different viriety of plant than cannabis. The seeds are sterilized upon import into the US, by law. These seeds are grown in Canada, whos food safety standards are at least equal to the US. These are also USDA certified organic.<br /><br />A geat product. Nutiva is a good brand whos consistent quality I have come to trust. I love their 50%-protien hemp-protien too.<br /><br />Hope that helps.

Very peachy and crunchy. Occasionally, you get a piece that has a slighty less lovely flavor, with an aftertaste that says the original fruit was mayhaps too ripe, but mostly a good product. So easy to carry fruit in a bag in my purse this way to snack when I get a candy craving.

Some dissolve in your mouth, some need to be chewed, but this hasn't been an issue for us.  They taste great and we will continue to buy these!

review/summary: Didn't work for me, but worth a try. Order it from Amazon.
review/text: The first time I posted my experience, six readers immediately disagreed with it (obviously they felt they knew far better than I whether FRS Healthy Energy provided me with any "lift").  I withdrew the review, but upon reflection I've regretted my decision to do so.  Whether or not the product "worked" for an individual is necessarily personal and anecdotal, one person's report.  It's hardly a matter for disagreement--unless the responder is intent upon promoting an agenda.<br /><br />All of the FRS products have ingredients likely to be familiar to users of "energy" drinks, powders, supplements, and bites: sugar, corn syrup, fructose, caffeine, green tea extract. The drink also offers the MDR for key vitamins along with antioxidant activity from the green tea leaves and, most importantly, "quercetin," a bioflavanoid that is used in red wine replacement capsules as a highly potent free radical scavenger.  While "quercetin" is widely recognized as an effective blood toner, conditioner, and "bad" cholesterol reducer, FRS is prominently promoting it as an energizer, capable of "extending" the body's natural adrenaline "and" removing the "oxidants that cause fatigue."  A controversial statement, backed by little controlled studies, especially if the inference is that quercetin will provide an immediate "lift."<br /><br />Of course, FRS points out that it's not simply the individual ingredients that provide increased energy but an optimal, catalytic combination that promotes thermogenesis, increases metabolic rate, and helps the body make efficient use of carbohydrates.  So it's possible the product has worked for many (besides Mr. Armstrong).  If so, testimonials on its behalf deserve to be taken seriously by any curious, health-minded individuals.<br /><br />The powdered drink mix perhaps makes the most sense to start with, and the chewy bites the least (the sugar in the bites actually had a paradoxical effect, momentarily enervating rather than energizing me).  The drink is flavorable enough, with a convincing fresh-fruitish "tang," and not overly sweet.  But in my case it did not counteract either the late-morning or late-afternoon "crashes" and obviate the need for that extra expresso or two.<br /><br />If you choose to try the product, be exceptionally careful about the apparently generous internet offer, endorsed by Mr. Armstrong, of a complete sample kit of the products sent free of charge (with the exception of postage and handling costs).  The merchandising tactics of FRS are practically antithetical to the full-disclosure, consumer-centric policies of a site like Amazon.  (If Bezos offered everyone a free Kindle, saying it's yours to keep if you don't like it, I'd have full confidence in his offer; FRS employs more deceptive, misleading tactics that could result in your admittance to a pricey club before you even realized you were a member.)<br /><br />So put Lance Armstrong and his company (he's part owner) to the test, but order the products through Amazon to avoid unwanted hassle, hustle and hype.  If you decide the product is for you, then is the time to inquire into the benefits of being a member of the club.

review/summary: Great Sustained Energy
review/text: I am pretty much a sceptic of so-called energy drinks.  Most of them give you a quick buzz, then let you down just as hard.  But, that being said, I am a cyclist, so I decided to give this a try since Lance has his hand in the company.<br /><br />I love it.  I love it.  What I especially love is the fact that it is a gradual release.  You don't get that horribly jumpy I-gotta-run-around-the-block feeling.  I drink it about 30 minutes before my ride, which is usually 20 to 30 miles, and about a third of the way into the ride it kicks in.  I don't get a rush, just a feeling that I can keep going and push a little harder.  The energy really does seem to last for a few hours without a horrible crash at the end.<br /><br />Taste is not bad, not great, but certainly drinkable.  I got the orange powder.  I put it in a shaker bottle with eight ounces of COLD water, let it sit for a bit, then drink.  It reminds me of the orange Tang I used to drink as a kid.<br /><br />This is a product I will buy again.

review/summary: FRS Hype??
review/text: I purchased FRS powdered drink for the energy it would provide (so the packaging suggests).  Like many people, I work during the day and the evenings often times bring on another part time if not full time job.  As far as energy goes, no more energy for me than taking my daily vitamin in the mornings.  I purchased the orange flavored powder which doesn't taste too bad but not a flavor I would want to drink long term.  Perhaps I lacked energy because I didn't adhere to the suggested daily intake of more than 1 drink a day (who would want to and how many people could afford it?).  In any event, take a vitamin instead (save your money).  I'm being generous in giving this product 3 stars only because of the nutritional value.

review/text: Just as the description states: "for sustained energy and weight reduction". FRS does not give you a jolt like caffeine does, instead it is more subtle. It'll keep you awake in work after a heavy lunch, or will give you the energy to do just a little more during your workout. Consequently, it raises your metabolism making dieting more efficient.

review/summary: Great energy supplement
review/text: I had tried the FRS products (concentrate liquid, chewy snacks and powder supplement that you mix with water) on a free trial from the mfr.  Although I did not sign up for the automatic ship program, I knew this supplement was working because I had more energy to get through the demands of the day than I have had in months.  I continue to take the FRS daily and would recommend it highly to anyone who has depleted energy or just wants to destroy as many of the free radicals in their system as possible.

review/summary: High Cost but High Energy...the good and the bad
review/text: I wake up at 4:30 am every day to workout and get things done around the house. I work full-time and do weight loss counseling during my lunch on top of it.<br /><br />Enough said on why I need energy, right?<br /><br />I actually hate the canned energy drinks because, although they worked, my heart raced and I crashed hard a few hours later and you could hardly wake me from a nap.<br /><br />Enter FRS.  I actually prefer to liquid concentrated version, to be honest. But these are good for when I travel or when I'm on the go since you have to refrigerate the concentrate.<br /><br />Positives:<br />Works like crazy. There is a reason Lance Armstrong uses this stuff. That's not a plug, I don't work for FRS. But I do live in Austin with L.A. (well, not actually WITH him...anyhoo...)<br />Has less caffeine than 1/3 cup of coffee. No racing heart. No crash. No bad side effects<br />Provides all natural energy from quercetin and high antioxidants<br />Quercetin is currently being studied by the FDA as a treatment for obesity. No results yet, but preliminary use of quercetin resulted in weight loss in many of its users which put it in the testing. (Google it...it's too long for me go into.) I shouldn't say you'll lose weight from it because of that...I have no clue. I swear it helps me but it could be coincidence that I have more energy which results in doing more, which results in weight loss. Who knows.<br />I know I need to drink it, but I hate water. I don't use a full packet of this in my water so that I get more "water" in my ratio, but it flavors it well so I suck it down.<br />I love the berry taste.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />This doesn't dissolve as well as other water flavorings. It often sticks to the side of my water bottle, or the bottom. Also, it can clump which means I'll suck in a tiny glob of it--this wouldn't be a problem if it were something like hot cocoa mix but the stuff has lots of vitamins in it so you suck in a clump and you get a tangy vitiman aftertaste<br />It's too expensive in my opinion for water powder. But I still buy it. It sucked me in.<br />I think the liquid concentrate is actually more potent but this works in a pinch when I'm on the go or to flavor my water since I am not a fan of water and flavorings are the only way I'll drink it.<br /><br />Conclusion: If they had competition on an all-natural Quercetin-full powdered drink mix, I'd shop it in hopes for better dissolving and a lower price...til then, I just use it sparingly and I use the FRS liquid low calorie concentrate as my "go to" healthy energizer every day (especially in the morn and prior to any workout).  I have that on automatic ordering through Amazon so it's actually 50% less than if I order it directly through FRS (I think the FRS site it a tad of a rip off for a few reasons) since it's 15% off that way and there is no shipping costs...that stuff is heavy if you order lots of bottles so it's worth it.

review/summary: unbelievable product
review/text: I've always struggled with excessive fatigue, taking an hour nap everyday, constantly yawning about 10-30 times in the morning and I was about to go to the doctor to find out what was wrong. Then I came across the frs energy drink site and tried out the free trial. The results were amazing. As soon as I drank it, I felt the fatigue in the morning that felt like a heavy backpack completely disappear and I had no urge to take my everyday nap. I had a high level of energy that lasted the entire day. Even as I'm typing this at night, I am still feeling it. And even more amazingly, with all this, there were NO side effects whatsoever. I'm taking it everyday since and I strongly recommend it to anyone who struggles with fatigue.

review/summary: Like it, works as advertised
review/text: I really like this and appreciate that it is a low calorie sports drink. I tend to put it into larger water bottles (20 ounces) and find that if I sip on it while at the gym or on a long ride, it provides a boost of energy. It is tough to dissolve the substance in water but a larger bottle shaken over time takes care of that. Well worth the money and I don't feel like I'm drinking back all of the calories I burn at the gym!

review/summary: Great pick-me-up for the late afternoon slump
review/text: Best to purchase thru Amazon or Ebay for 1st time buyers, then you don't get stuck with the auto shipments and the hassle of canceling your membership in the FRS Club if you don't plan to re-order.  Overall, FRS has great products, albeit pricey.

review/summary: Energizer
review/text: I've recently gotten into health drinks (Emergen-C and ZipFizz, etc...). This stuff is a little expensive but I got it with the 15% discount. Without a doubt I had more energy while working out the first time I tried it - I burned 100 more calories than I usually do on the treadmill and afterwards felt like I had never gone running in the first place. I've used it a few more times since then and this stuff is great. I'm no health expert but I have already recommended this stuff to several siblings and friends. Everyone I've told about it (gave them a free pack) liked it a lot and got their own.<br /><br />Try it out for yourself. I take it 30 mins before I workout.
