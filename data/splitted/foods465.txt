review/summary: GREAT DEAL!
review/text: For the money this has been the best wine kit I have ever bought. I have been making wine for years and I have paid a lot. Now that I have found a more affordable way to do it I may be making more than just a few a year! Would recommend. Came quickly good product.

review/summary: Good service
review/text: I ordered this based mainly on alegatorsams recommendation. When It arrived in two day it had everything listed in good shape. The only problem was for my old eyes the instructions were small and hard to read. I sent them an e mail and within 2 hours they sent back a great PDF copy that i can read.<br /><br />Ok this is day 5 of fermentation. Hydrometer reading in primary was 1.012 so I racked into car buoy. All went well and when done I racked some of the lees into a clean milk jug so I could taste test it. You know I had to do this! (grin) Color is a deep rich red and taste is really quite good even at this stage, I can't wait for the finished product.<br /><br />My thanks again to Sam for his review this may be my favorite wine too. Still 5 stars plus on rating><br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Bottled yesterday after racking and filtering. Tasted some and found it to be slightly fruity semi dry with no  after taste. It was as good as most wines at the package store and I bet with some age it will be better than most. This morning I put the shrink caps on and the labels. That was real easy with hot air blower and a  moist sponge now the bottles look like a professional job.<br /><br />All together this is a real good kit for anyone and just remember if the instructions are a little small to read a simple e mail will get you a file in adobe format from the company.

review/summary: Nice Kit!
review/text: I made 3 of these kits in the past and they came out very good for the price.  The last batch I made I did in a 5 gallon quanity in hopes there would be a little more body to it as some reviews said.  I found no change in the body from 6 to 5 gallons and ended up with 24 bottles instead of the 29 or 30 bottles I usually get from the 6 gallon instructions.  I opened a bottle I made from a 6 gallon batch that was bottled in December, 2011 and it was very good!  I WILL NOT make another kit in a 5 gallon batch!

review/text: This is a great wine kit value. I hope Amazon continues to make this product available in the future. Wine snobs who think less of these kits should pay $100 plus for over priced kits and send their reviews to those companies. This is a fun hobby and should be looked at as such. Successes with these kits have given me the confidence to even try Welch's grape juice concentrate batches, but believe it or not, the Amazon kits are a lot cheaper to purchase than the concentrates (along with all the other components)at the store. Have fun!

review/summary: Everyday Delicious Wine
review/text: I've made a couple dozen of this very kit.  It's a fantastic everyday drinking wine.  If done properly, it's a smooth, semi-dry red wine.  The instructions are quite simple and if you're a newbie at wine making, you should definitely try these Vino Italiano kits made by Paklab as they are fool-proof.  This "Val" kit is my absolute favorite.  It's completely drinkable in 4 weeks, but give it 4 months in the bottle and it's ridiculous the value you get for a buck fifty a bottle.

review/summary: Decent kit for cheap
review/text: I did not expect much from this kit but got more than I thought.  I made it to 5 gallons, as this is what others had mentioned.  That was likely the key to this kit.  Had I made it to 6 gallons it would have been extremely watery.  I tweaked it with a banana skin, 1 pound of raisins, Hungarian medium oak, and 1 can of dark sweet cherries.  At 4 months it wasn't so good. At 8 months it was a tasty wine.  I turned out to be a light to medium bodied wine.  Buy it and tweak it a bit.

review/text: The chicken pieces inside are not firm. Some of them have disintegrated into dust like residue and they line the bottom of the can. The other solid pieces are powdering slowly. Not at all appealing to watch when you open the can expecting chunk chicken. Still since this is a healthier option and maybe they are not using any preservatives to keep the firmness, i dont have much problem with this product.

review/summary: a bit pricey but really handy
review/text: I never used canned chicken before so cannot compare this to other brands.  I buy this because even though it is not organic it is the healthiest canned chicken I can find anywhere.  YES, it does fall apart and there are some teeny bits in the can as the other reviewer pointed out.  However, it has a really nice rich flavor.<br /><br />If you hate handling raw chicken as much as I do you will find these little cans to be just the right thing when you want to make white chicken chili or chicken noodle soup for 2, or when you want just a bit of meat to toss into a veggie stir fry right at the end.  I use Imagine brand organic free range chicken broth.  The combination of that broth and this chicken is very tasty indeed.

review/summary: Indulge yourself  :)
review/text: If you want to taste something different, and truly wonderful, buy this product. &quot;Dulce de leche&quot; is a typical Argentinian product, and one of my favorite temptations. In case you are not familiar with it, I must say that you are really losing something great...<p>Dulce de leche is a dessert that can be eaten alone or as a topping (for example, on waffles, bread or ice cream). It is also used a lot in cakes and other pastries, and its savor is sweet. It is made by blending hot milk, sugar, and vanilla, and as a result has some nutritional value. However, the most important thing is that it is mouthwateringly delicious :)<p>Even if this product is extraordinarily good, it is important to choose the right label, because a good one can be guarantee of excellence. In my opinion, &quot;La Salamandra&quot; is one of the few labels that allow you to be certain that what you are going to eat is not only tasty, but also made of  superior quality raw ingredients. &quot;La Salamandra&quot; is very well-known in Argentina, but has also won some prizes in USA. For example, this product won the 2000 Fancy Food Show's Gold Trophy for spreads/sweet toppings. <p>All in all, I advise you to indulge yourself and give &quot;La Salamandra&quot;'s dulce de leche a try. The price isn't overly high, so you don't have much to lose, and all to win :)<p>Belen Alcat

review/summary: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS...
review/text: This is a caramel flavored filling/topping that is very popular among people from Latin America. I grew up eating dulce the leche, as my parents were Cuban. My ex-husband is from Argentina, and he, too, grew up eating this mouth-watering, sweet dessert topping.<br /><br />It is delicious with ice cream, with flan, and as pastry filling. I even know people who eat it as a spread on white bread. It is also delicious by itself, though one cannot eat all that much of it in one sitting as it is so sweet. When I discovered its availability on Amazon and saw that it was recommended by a fellow reviewer, I immediately bought three jars, even though the shipping was on the high side. Well, the actual product more than met my expectations, as it was absolutely delicious. I can certainly understand why it was the Gold Trophy winner in the spreads/sweet toppings category at the 2000 Fancy Food Show.<br /><br />I am only sorry that I did not buy more than three jars of it, as I see that it is no longer available through Amazon, and I am plumb out of it. The good thing, however, is that I know how to make dulce de leche. I am, however,  notoriously lazy about cooking. Maybe the fact that it is no longer available will galvanize me into whipping up a batch of this delicious taste treat. If not, I can only hope that it will become available.

As far as i know La Salamandra has not bought them, and they are in fact their competitors.

review/text: This looks like it is meant for a store counter, not a gift or home purchase.  The tins would make nice favors, hostess gifts, stocking stuffers, etc.<br />They don't mention it, but the bags are pods.  Not that you can't use them as a bag, but still a surprise.  I also didn't expect the tins to be as large as they are, I was thinking pocket size. The tin is about 3.5" square by 1.5".  The eight bags are sealed in a foil package so you know it is fresh when you open it.  The tin has a tight fit so they won't go stale right away after you open the package.<br /><br />I am not a big tea drinker.  I love the tea I get in Chinese restaurants, but I have never been able to duplicate the taste.  I know it is good for me so I have experimented a lot this year.<br />So far I have only drank the pomegranate.  It smells divine. I used one pod to make a small teapot of tea and it steeped quickly, has a rich color and a sweet and delicate aroma.  I detect no bitterness to the tea itself.  Success!<br />I am pleased with the Bentley brand and have given it as a gift to great acclaim.<br />I recommend it.

review/text: This was the first time I've purchased a product from Lana's Little House, and I will definitely be a regular customer in the future. I was searching for a good jasmine tea, but when I read the reviews for Paris I couldn't resist adding a tin to my shopping cart.  It has quickly become my "go-to" tea.  The flavor is smooth and lovely--I'm typically more a fan of green tea, but this black tea has become a favorite.  A perfect winter day is coming in from the slopes to enjoy an evening with a pot of Paris (just a touch of honey and lemon!), a good book, and my husband napping on the couch with the cat curled up on his chest.  The bonus is that the shop owner, Lana, provides excellent service.  I received my package in the mail very quickly, she included a sweet little handwritten note and free sample in the package, and when I had a question for her she answered promptly. Additionally, her prices are very competitive for a good tea.  Not only can you feel good about purchasing a high quality product, but you can feel great about supporting an excellent small business!

If you like fragrant teas like I do (I'm also a huge fan of Jasmine tea), then you want this tea! I like how you can reuse the tea bags, although the second cup isn't quite as nice. It's nice plain, but I feel like the comfy aroma just begs to be complimented with a little milk and honey. I will definitely be ordering more of this tea and more from Harney and Sons, if only to get the adorable tins the tea comes in!

review/text: This is very similar in flavor to Kusmi St. Petersburg, although St. Petersburg is far superior in complexity of flavor. Ultimately, I find Paris to be a little boring.<br /><br />I've noticed that the caffeine in Paris makes me feel jittery for some reason. I drink black tea every morning and don't have this problem with other brands. Not sure why Paris seems intensely caffeinated in comparison.<br /><br />For those who'd like to try this tea without breaking the bank, I've found Paris and other selections at The Fresh Market for just $5.99. My local grocery store carries a few flavors as well, all for around $6. H&S Dragon Pearl Jasmine is my favorite from this line.<br /><br />If you're willing to shell out $15-20 for a tea, try Kusmi instead.

review/summary: Love this Tea!
review/text: Ordered this tea recently and their Hot Cinnamon tea also. I have to say both are exquisite but this Paris Tea is the best black tea I have ever had! It's a perfect blend of black with a touch of Earl Grey and a nice Vanilla note. It is suppose to be one of the most popular tea blends in Paris. I am getting 3 small tea cups brewed per sachet (bag). If you love tea you have to try this one! The tins are cool also!

review/summary: Smooth Delight
review/text: The sweet, floral notes of the Paris blend tea infuse a delicate balance of citrus and fruit flavor. Tea sachets are meshed for adequate steeping, though nothing can replace properly brewed loose-leaf tea. The bagged tea leaves are high quality, noticeably more natural then mashed contents of typical American tea bags. Texture of tea is highly smooth, leaving behind a pleasant, velvety taste. Wonderful with cream and sugar! Perfect for breakfast or an afternoon cup. Worthy of pinkie lifting, fine bone china, and a fresh made scone or two. Definitely recommended.

She tends to leave many of the chunky bits but after having her turn her nose up and leave everything in her dish with other flavors it's clear she likes this cat food. Purchase it for her on the Amazon subscribe & save option so she always has plenty of cans available.  Subscribe and save price is a few cents over PetCo price but Amazon includes shipping and PetCo does not so Amazon comes out less expensive overall.

She LOVES this stuff.  Will be trying the roasted Turkey next.  In looking at the ingredients, it has muscle meat and not just by products.  It has a very high protein % as well.  For those wondering it is 56% protein, 34% fat and 10% carb.  Very good food for a diabetic cat or a cat who needs to lose some weight.  I will be ordering from Amazon on their subscribe and save plan and have cases delivered to my front door.  Calories per 3 oz can are 78.  I have done my homework!

review/summary: Kitties love "junk food"
review/text: My two kitties enjoy a diet of all natural top of the line cat food, but they are not above enjoying a little "junk food" now and then. I ran out of their natural brand between shipments and went to the supermarket where I grabbed a few cans of Fancy Feast, not even looking at what flavor it was. The kits were pawing at the can as soon as I popped the top and started gobbling the food before it even hit the dish! I was shocked! None the less, I can't help calling Fancy Feast Roasted Chicken "junk food", since chicken,( which is "supposed" to be in the can---and, by the way, ROASTED !!!! if we are to believe the label), is listed in a distant fifth place, after fish broth, meat by products, salmon, and wheat gluten. I care about what goes into the pets' food as much as I do my own and I have seen the benefits of a good healthy diet on their general health, appearance and well being... however, that being said, I can't see the harm in indulging in some tasty little food by products now and again...we all need a junk food fix now and again, and since the kitties love it so much, it makes me happy to give it to them as  a treat.

review/text: I grew up in Scotland in the 1930's. The three daily meals were called breakfast,dinner, and tea, in that order. Yes,tea was so important that the last meal of the day was called tea.<br />  I've lived in the USA for over 50 years. It's been great but finding an easy source of good tea has been a chalenge, until now. That is until I found London Cuppa and an easy and affordable source via Amazon.com. The taste is rich and very smooth; the best tea I've ever had.

review/text: As one other reviewer said... I found this tea by accident, and now I search for it.<br /><br />Everything else pales in comparison.  This is absolutely the best black tea anywhere.  I've tried brand after brand, both major and obscure.  London Cuppa beats everyone else.  You haven't really had tea until you've tasted London Cuppa.<br /><br />I used to read novels where the heroine was in (mostly emotional) distress and some kindly woman would say, "Here, love, let me fix a good, strong cup of tea."  And I could never identify with that, because tea for me was that watery stuff with barely any flavor or color that people drank because it was "better for you than coffee".  "Strong Tea" seemed an oxymoron.  Now, it's London Cuppa, and it's great!  Try it, and you won't be able to live without it.

review/text: I have been drinking London Cuppa tea for a few years, always getting the 80 or 40-bag boxes from tjmaxx.  However, I can't find them there anymore and luckily Amazon carries them.  I go through about 2 to 3 bags a day.  At 7 cents a tea bag, this is the best deal if you must have strong, unflavored black tea.  It is great drinking by itself, with cream, and/or sugar.  I can't recommand it enough to strong tea lovers!  Amazon has the best deal and at this price, you don't pay for shipping.

review/summary: It was love at first cuppa!
review/text: Once upon a time I dated a Brit who taught me to appreciate tea that actually has some flavor and body, which teas "blended for the American palate" do not have, and also how to make it (the water MUST be BOILING when poured over the bags).  And once you know what tea SHOULD be, you can't ever go back. I was spending a fortune getting various brands from importers when I tripped over London Cuppa at TJMaxx and bought a box...After I'd made the first cup I went back and bought every box they had...and continued to do that every time I saw it at TJMaxx till I found the 440 bag pack at an importer. Their price was good, but their shipping charge was outrageous! I was about to order again from them anyway till it occurred to me to check Amazon (what the heck, they have everything else!)--and there it was, even eligible for free super saver shipping! Woohoo! :)<br /><br />My only quibble with the 440 count bag is that, unlike other English tea brands, the tea bags aren't in 40 or 80 count air tight pouches. 440 bags is a LOT of tea bags, and tea deteriorates when not stored in air tight conditions for any length of time. But I have a Food Saver and a Fresh Saver (vacuum baggers for frozen and fresh foods), so I repack it myself in bags of 80 and keep those in the big bag in the pantry (yes, those bags ARE expensive, but they're re-useable). When I open a pouch it goes into a sealable tin by the stove.<br /><br />If you like GOOD strong black tea, you'll love London Cuppa. And Amazon has it for the best price.

It's my preferred brand and I've been drinking English teas for a good 25 years now.  I've been known to clear the shelf at TJMaxx when the boxes of 40 and 80 pop up.  Imagine my surprise and delight when I discovered that I could get 440 bags from Amazon!!!  If you buy the 440 of London Cuppa, then please keep your tea in a tin, to preserve the flavour and don't ever store it in the freezer.  It will moisten and mold there.

review/text: I was first introduced to good tea by a couple of expatriates from Britain. This is the tea they drank. The only place to find it was at TJMax, if you can believe it. The chance of actually finding it on the shelf was iffy at best, considering I was competeing with about a dozen serious tea drinkers who also knew about this stash. I actually walked into the store one time to find my good friend who introduced me to London Cuppa walking out with 10 boxes, he was kind enough to have left one behind. Needless to say, it is absolutely wonderful to have found this source. I was really delighted to find the bag of 440 tea bags to be huge.

review/text: I always purchase either Yorkshire Tea or London Cuppa from TJMaxx but, recently, they have been out of stock.  I was delighted to see this supersize 440 London Cuppa teabags on Amazon and did not hesitate to spend $33.  Delivery was efficient but I am so disappointed with the taste.  There is very little tea in the bag which means you have to use two bags to make a decent cuppa.  Yesterday my usual 80 bag box reappeared in TJMaxx (price $6) and I snatched every one off the shelf to compare ... as I suspected, the teabag from the 440 pack weighs 2g and the bag from the 80 box weighs 4g.

I, therefore, always order this giant 440 bag size, about once a year (or a bit more), for my own personal use.  I drink it every day, rather than coffee, and keep the bag tightly sealed and refrigerated, taking out only a week's worth of tea bags at a time for easy access.  You don't need to let it steep very long, which is great for us impatient people!

review/summary: Make it like coffee--no sugar
review/text: I make this like coffee, no sugar, hot water with or without cream added later. It is delicious and does not need sugar or (heaven forbid!) artificial sweeteners. Smooth, flavorful, not at all bitter. I can drink it later in the evening than I can coffee. I love chocolate but can not stand sweet beverages.

review/summary: A Great Cocoa!
review/text: Ghirardelli is the only cocoa powder we use at our house.  It's very flavorful for making chocolate milk or hot chocolate - far more flavorful than any other brand of cocoa we've had.  It isn't loaded with harmful fats or with lots of calories either, especially if you mix it with Splenda instead of sugar.  It's a great way to have chocolate without guilt.

review/summary: Great for LCHF diets
review/text: I eat a ketogenic, low-carb diet and this is a great product for that with only two effective grams of carbohydrate per tablespoon serving. Combined with some imaginative use of other ingredients like flax seed meal you can create nearly zero-carb brownies, for example. Or mix into unsweetened coconut milk for a great chocolate shake, and super healthy. Since this listing doesn't include nutritional information I thought I would include some notes for the discriminating shoppers:<br /><br />Serving size: 1 tablespoon (6g), 15 calories<br />Total fat: 1.5g (1g saturated, no trans-fats)<br />Total carbohydrate: 3g (1g fiber, 0g sugar, effective net carbs 2g)<br />Protein: 1g<br /><br />No cholesterol or sodium if you care about those things.

review/text: After reading reviews on here I had high hopes for this product thinking that maybe it was like Swiss chocolate.  It's slightly less bitter than Hershey's but other than that I don't see much of a difference except in price.  I purchased three cans expecting a real treat.  I will continue to buy Hershey's for it is much cheaper and the difference is not worth the higher price.  I only pay about $5 for 8oz of Hershey chocolate.  Save your $$$.

review/text: My sister-in-law from LA introduced me to this product, and I have never tasted another herb tea like it!  It's one of the few herbal, caffeine-free beverages that packs a strong flavor.  If you like spicy flavors like hot cinnamon, you'll love this drink!  My only advice is to let it steep for a long time--maybe 15 minutes--and NOT to add too much water.  I like to use huge mugs for my drinks, but in order to fully enjoy this particular herb tea, you can't put more water than fits into a standard mug, say 6 to 8 ounces of boiling water per bag.

review/summary: Good for Rare Snacks.
review/text: We try to keep candies, cookies, cakes and things of that sort out of the house, or at least keep their supply to a bare minimum. It's difficult. We try to stay well stocked on fresh and dried fruits as substitutes. However, there are those times when a treat seems in order. My wife found these Special K Bars and we keep a supply on hand. They're only 90 calories each and have a low fat content. They're made from whole grains. How bad can that be?<br /><br />I tend to prefer the strawberry variety. My wife has a preference for the Chocolate Drizzle. It really doesn't matter. I tend to think they're too sweet, too much like candy, but every once in a while I'll have one. When I'm carrying my lunch to work, I sometimes include one. We buy the large box and keep them in a sealed container. They have a long shelf life and must contain a lot of preservatives. Oh well, they're not a bad snack on those rare occasions. I might add that we never use them as a breakfast food.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: I like it
review/text: I have been a Droste Cocoa (Dutch cocoa, and Dutch processed) customer for nearly 50 years, but was running out last week and I had another look at what's available at Amazon in the way of cocoa. The almost uniformly highly positive reviews here made me decide to try Pernigotti, another Dutch processed cocoa. I've cooked with cocoa over the years but am not in the habit of doing so recently. My usage has been limited to hot cocoa, and that's what I have tried so far with the Pernigotti, and I've compared it several times with both Droste and Valrhona cocoa. They are all good, but somewhat different. I definitely notice the vanilla accent of the Pernigotti. I wasn't sure I liked that at first, but decided that it's a subtle accent and not too intrusive. I wasn't used to it, but I think it's OK. The chocolate flavor is very nice, I think maybe better than the Droste, even, which was the best cocoa I had ever experienced. I once bought a can of Hershey's cocoa to see if it was OK, this was back in the 1970's and I was disgusted and I think I actually returned it to the market for a refund. I prefer Droste to Valrhona, but I may have found a new favorite now. The reviews at Amazon for Droste cocoa are not nearly as positive as for Pernigotti. Droste is more expensive here, but I can get it locally for about the same as the Pernigotti online, however I may stick with the Pernigotti now.<br /><br />I have developed a system for making hot cocoa that removes the guess work and results in uniformly pleasing cups of hot cocoa. Here it is:<br /><br />It's (by weight) 1 part cocoa, 2 parts sugar, 3 parts non fat dry milk, all mixed very well together and stored. To make, boil 3 parts water, pour over 1 part the mixture (again, by weight), stir well.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I dug up a long time favorite chocolate recipe of mine (my own creation) and tried it with the Pernigotti -- Cocoa Pecan Cookies. It came out great. This recipe is to make cookie rolls, you bake a batch very quickly and easily any time you care to. To prepare the cookies, you preheat the oven, slice up a cookie roll, spread the slices on a cookie sheet and bake. Very simple. Here's the recipe:<br /><br />Cocoa Pecan Cookies<br />(Dough for 8 batches)<br /><br />1 stick melted butter<br />3/4 c. cocoa powder<br />1.5 c sugar<br />2 eggs (large)<br />2 c flour<br />1/2 t salt (this can be adjusted according to preference)<br />1 t baking soda<br />1 t vanilla (this was with Droste cocoa, since Pernigotti has vanilla this can be eliminated or adjusted)<br />1 cup pecans (previously kept in freezer to prevent staling)<br /><br />Melt or soften the butter. Put all the above except the flour and pecans in bowl and beat well. Add 3/4 of the flour and beat and then add last portion of flour (1/2 cup) and mix in. Then add the pecans and mix reasonably well and then scoop out on a floured board and knead to get the nuts evenly distributed. Cut in 2 and cut one of those in 2. Take one of those and roll to about 10 inches long and cut it in 2 (you have an eighth). Cylinder should be about 1 inch thick and about 5 inches long. Press ends to flatten with blade and put in pan. Do same with the rest and put pan in bag, seal and place in refrigerator to firm for a few hours. Remove the rolls to plastic bag for refrigerated storage.<br /><br />To cook, preheat oven to 350 degrees, using sharp knfe slice one cookie roll into approximately 30 cookies, place them evenly on cookie sheet (teflon coated) and cook 10 minutes. Immediately scrape off with plastic spatula and let cool upside down. They should cool to crispness if they've been cooked properly. Cook only to that point and no more or there will be some burning. Enjoy.<br /><br />Here's a breakdown nutritionally (calories, that is)<br /><br />eggs 158<br />butter 864<br />sugar 1155<br />flour 825<br />pecans 750<br />vanilla<br />cocoa 168<br /><br />3932 for 8 batches<br />491 per batch, 181 fat calories<br />37% from fat

review/summary: Unbelieveably good.
review/text: I bake.  A lot.  Everyone looks for my baked goods at the holidays, but no one was expecting the chocolate cake made with Pernigotti.  Another reviewer commented about the rich aroma when the bag is opened, and she's right. The cocoa is a beautiful reddish-brown, and has the richest, most delightful smell ever. The only cocoa I found that remotely reminds me of this one is Schokinag. I found this at Williams-Sonoma, but it's priced much better here, even with shipping.  The only thing I have to say, to those who are not aware that there is a difference between Dutch Process and regular cocoa, is that you have to either watch the recipes you use it in or find a way to modify the recipe you have. I did the latter for the chocolate cake and it was wonderful. My brownies, which don't need modification came out so perfect that no one could believe that just changing the cocoa made that much of a difference.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this product, and had I not bought enough from WS to last the holidays, I would be buying this last one available now. Someone needs to snatch it up quick!

review/summary: Sinfully Delicious
review/text: I am a hot chocolate connoisseur and have tried many different cocoa powders and drink mixes.  This has to be one of the best I have ever tried.  The second you open the bag, the most intense chocolate scent wafts up to you nose. Try that with regular cocoa.  I take the powder, add a few of my own spices and then I enjoy it for breakfast all winter.  I haven't ever made cookies or anything else with it, but I imagine it would be just as delicious in those recipes as well.

review/summary: Smooth taste
review/text: I am not a chocolate fanatic.  I generally will order the non-chocolate choice on the dessert menu.  I do a lot of home baking for my wife and others, and wanted a great dutch-processed cocoa to use.  One of the cakes I make uses cocoa in both the icing and the batter.  When I made the cake, which I usually do not care to eat, I loved it.  The usual bite of a natural cocoa was gone, the usual bitterness was non-existent.  I also made some brownies using this cocoa and a high quality natural cocoa.  I did blind taste tests with four other people.  Four of the five of us chose the brownies with this cocoa over the natural cocoa.  The only one to choose the brownies with the natural cocoa was someone who loves dark chocolate.  She did say that both were excellent, she just liked that little bite that the natural cocoa provided.  I will purchase this cocoa from now on, it is well worth it!

review/summary: Excellent Italian Cocoa
review/text: Pernigotti Cocoa, is one of the best type of Cocoa for hot Chocolate and or baking.  Much better than the chemicals one buys marketed as Cocoa here in the United States.

review/summary: Now this is great cocoa for syrup
review/text: We just made three batches of nearly identical syrup...Valrhona, Pernigotti, and Hershey Special Dark. Mix was 1c sugar, 0.5c water, 0.5c cocoa, 1/3 tsp vanilla (the way we make up syrup in our house). The Hershey's was actually just what was left in an older tin, but I figured it would add a baseline (I'm generally not a fan). All three were prepared from a common simple syrup base, and all were whisked the same amount of time and brought to the same temp before taking off the heat.<br /><br />The Hershey's was fine, better than a bottle, but not as good as our usual Bensdorp ( from King Arthur Flour). The Valrhona was so bad, I'm not sure I'd even use it in milk or on ice cream. Pernigotti was the favorite of all three of us, by a good margin.  There were no strident or bitter flavors, and was as close to a dense, liquid chocolate flavor as we've tasted.

review/summary: Best Cocoa On The Planet
review/text: Seriously, this is THE BEST Cocoa in the world. I recently made a Fudge Ripple Cake with it, and the frosting (using the Pernigotti Cocoa) was the best I've ever made. Everyone raved about it. Now, the question is, should I share the secret to the fantastic taste of this cake and frosting with them.  Hmm...
