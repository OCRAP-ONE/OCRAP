review/text: I first bought the 8oz pack and loved them and finished them in a couple weeks.  I just pour them into a cup and eat them in the morning at work with my morning OJ.  I can't really compare them to anything else in taste but they rock.<br /><br />The 3lb pack has been just as good but at a much better price.  I've been sharing them at work and they have been a big hit.  I've not tried them in anything but I'm sure they would enhance salads.<br /><br />I was also sent some bonus stuff with my order, so I give Nutiva and A+ (even without the hemp shake packets)

review/summary: Zola and migraine
review/text: This is a long message. I apologize for its length. I would like to communicate my experience with Zola Acai Blueberry. I started drinking it, and the other two drinks in this series, Zola Acai Plain and Zola Acai Pineapple, several months ago, before they switched over to their new processing and bottling procedures. I tried all three drinks, and eventually became addicted to Zola Acai Blueberry. When they switched over to their new methods, I was at first disappointed, because I was used to the old taste and composition, but the contents were exactly the same, and I quickly became addicted to the new. It's by far my favorite drink, and I have to stop myself from drinking more than 3 bottles each day.<br /><br />All that is fine, but it's not the real story. The real story is that it changed my life, because for at least the 8 years previous to that I had suffered from life-crushing migraines. I was a classic migraine sufferer, with perhaps two major migraines each month that completely incapacitated me for 20 hours each time once they began. During that time I could do no more than sit up and fast with my back against the wall and legs raised up to bed height, in total darkness, with no noise, and in excruciating pain. It was impossible to do anything but sit there in total darkness and silence for 20 hours, trying to doze off as much as possible to escape the pain, and just watching the clock frantically waiting for the expected 20 hours to end my misery. I could not lie down on the bed, because that made the pain even worse.<br /><br />In between these major bouts of horror, I had numerous smaller migraines of various sizes. On most days I had migraines. Sometimes they forced me to lie in total darkness and silence for hours, sometimes they permitted me to work, read, or watch TV, but I was almost never free of headache for more than one or two days per week. On most nights I went to bed sitting up, to minimize the pain.<br /><br />When I started drinking Zola Acai, I noticed within a week that my migraine condition had suddenly improved a lot. As more days went by, it became increasingly undeniable that this was no random fluctuation. When a couple of rainy days came and I had no migraine, I knew that something really remarkable had happened. At that point I began a serious analytical effort trying to discover what was the cause of the sudden relief I was now experiencing.<br /><br />After some two to three weeks I had eliminated everything but the Zola Acai, of which, at that time, I was drinking perhaps 3 or 4 bottles per week. I searched on Google for some indication that acai could help a migraine, but ultimately found insufficient to my satisfaction. Meanwhile<br />I kept increasing my intake, and the more I did, the more relief I got. I also began checking on the other ingredients of the same drink. I took a hard look at the 24 mg of guarana berry (natural caffeine) that is in each bottle. When I checked on Google I found a number of entries pointing to guarana as helpful for migraine.<br /><br />Gradually, I became convinced that it wasn't the acai at all that was giving me the relief, but the guarana. At that point, I purchased a large bottle of guarana tablets from sourcenaturals.com (or more specifically, from the Life Extension foundation, which purchased them from sourcenaturals). Each tablet has 200 mg of guarana caffeine in it. I cut each in half, and began taking half a guarana tablet each day (the dosage on the bottle recommends 3 full tablets, 600 mg, for "energy" each day, and says not a word about migraine).<br /><br />I have continued drinking the Zola Acai, so I get about 150 to 175 mg of guarana caffeine per day in all. I rarely drink coffee, and seldom even tea. This regimen has all but removed migraines from my life. I have recommended Zola and guarana tablets enthusiastically to many people, but most people I know don't have migraines, and I am not sure that anyone has ever taken me up on it so far, so I don't know the results. When I can no longer afford Zola, I have reason to believe I will be fine on the guarana tablets alone, although I expect that I will probably have to up the intake each day to a full tablet (200 mg). Meanwhile, I keep drinking the Zola Acai Blueberry because I love it. I've tried other acai drinks, but they don't even begin to match up for me in taste and satisfaction.<br /><br />It's necessary to emphasize that my experience is totally anecdotal, that of one man, me. I know of no scientifically controlled studies to confirm what I'm saying. As far as I am aware, there aren't any, at least not yet. For perhaps 2 years prior to that I tried feverfew, which has given partial relief to some subjects in controlled studies, but I could not claim any relief from it, and finally just gave it up. Over-the-counter headache drugs, which have given some relief at times to others, just made my migraines worse.<br /><br />I no longer get the life-crushing migraines that plagued my life for years. I have gotten some two or three migraines during the last 6 months, evidently due to extreme insufficient sleep 2 to 3 nights in a row. These attacks lasted up to 20 hours each, but were not enough to stop me from writing, reading, going on the Internet, and watching videos. For someone used to real migraines, these were far from serious.<br /><br />Please spread this message as much as you can. I do not know how many it will help or not help, but it recounts an experience that has literally changed my life. Please include the whole message, if possible, and point out that this experience is as yet entirely anecdotal, so I have no idea how many people it might help and how many not. Migraines can come from entirely different sources, and there is little doubt that there are many migraine sufferers whom it not help at all. But the change was so sudden, dramatic, and emphatic in my own life, that it's hard not to expect that there will be others who will find a comparable relief.<br /><br />By the way, the price on Amazon is unexpectedly low. The cheapest I have found in New York City is $2.49/bottle at this time, minus 10% for an order over $150.00. That was at Whole Foods. Amazon's price is even lower, especially on small orders, and the best I have seen.<br /><br />I have no relation at this time other than as a customer to Amazon.com, Source Naturals,  Life Extension Foundation, or Zola, Inc.<br /><br />Eugene

review/summary: Healthy but Odd
review/text: I ordered 2 cases of this based upon the fact that the beverage contains substantial antioxidants. When I tried it, I found the taste pretty odd, and the drink rather gritty. Not terrible, just not particularly appealing. I guess that is the compromise you get with something so good for you. I will finish drinking all of my order eventually but will not be ordering more. I would not call this delicious for sure! Gibing it four stars anyway because others may enjoy the flavor more than I do, and it is indubitably healthy. One suggestion only - drink it very cold, as it seems a bit better that way.

review/text: I have been searching for a healthy yet economical drink for awhile.  I think I found it with Zola. The taste is pure real fruit deliciousness, and the ingredients are quality (better than 99.something% of the drinks on the market). The acai and blueberry go great together. I also tried the Light Acai, which is also great but not quite as tasty as this mix. With the auto-ship option and reasonable price for the healthy mix, I think Zola just snagged another long-term customer.

As for the juice itself, not only is it healthy and delicious but it gives me that extra bit of energy boost my job and long hours demands. The Blueberry as well as the new 50% less sugar are my favorites:)

review/summary: Excellent Drink
review/text: This is Zola Acai with blueberry juice.  It is a 12 FL. Oz (354 ML) plastic bottle with an easy open twist off cap.  It is quite tasty, quite pleasant, just sweet enough and not overbearing.  (I hate things that are sickening sweet and I hate things that have the artificial sugars like aspartame and such.  This is neither.)  The bottle suggests you serve it cold.  I just threw it in my bag and took off for work.  I drank it at room temperature.  (It may be tastier when cold but it was great at room temp.) I selected this flavor because of the alleged health benefits of both Acai and Blueberry.<br /><br />The bottle says all kinds of good things:  All natural, USDA organic, Brazilian Superfruits.  Each bottle provides 1200 mg Omega 3, 6, and 9 Fatty Acids.  (That was pretty impressive and it was a lot tastier than those wild salmon vitamin tablets for Omegas--burp--ewww.) Ingredients in order listed (1st listed is supposed to be highest concentration of, and down the list): Organic Acai Pulp, Organic Evap Cane Juice, Organic Blueberry Juice Concentrate, Organic Guarana (24 mg natural caffeine), Citric Acid, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors.  There are 1 1/2 servings in a bottle, so calories for the bottle are about 146.  An 8 oz serving includes 1.5g total fat, .5 is saturated fat, 0 mg cholesterol, 26 mg sodium, 18 mg potassium, 27 total carbs (1g being dietary fiber and 20g sugars, and 1g protein. An 8 oz serving contains 4% vitamin A, 15% vitamin C, 2% calcium, 10% iron, 10 % vitamin E.  93% juice.  Refrigerate after opening (but you'll likely drink the whole thing--the bottle is only 6 1/2 inches tall.  It is produced in the USA and distributed from California.<br /><br />I think that pretty much says it all.  I will not hesitate to buy this product again.  I will not hesitate to try the other flavors available.  It is a good drink to bring for lunch at work (or a liquid snack).  If I had a school child, I believe it would make a nice, healthy drink to pack with his/her lunch.

review/summary: One Observation Among Many
review/text: Reading the other reviews of this product is fascinating.  Bugs?  Dust?  Gooey messes?  Allergic reactions? My experience with Swheat Scoop has been, happily, quite different.  Heretofore, I've used clumping clay-based litters, most recently Arm & Hammer brand.  With all of them, though, I've observed that they are very dusty when being poured into the litter box, that they cake onto the cats' feet and are tracked through the house, and that they do little to mask the odor of urine or feces.  By contrast, Swheat Scoop has none of these drawbacks.<br /><br />After using a 15-pound box for the first time with two cats, I have observed that:<br /><br />- There is minimal tracking out of the litter box, and what there is is easily swept up, unlike clay litter which, when wet, sticks to the tile floor.<br /><br />- There is only a pleasant, natural odor which completely absorbs all urine and feces odors, making the litter box room much more pleasant.<br /><br />- There is no evidence of any dust whatsoever, even when pouring from the container into the litter box.<br /><br />- Clumping is satisfactory.  Sheat Scoop does not clump as tightly as clumping clay litters but is still easily scooped out of the litter box with a scoop designed for that purpose.  It does not adhere to the sides or the bottom of the litter box as clay litter does, and the box has stayed much, much cleaner than when it was filled with clay litter.  I realize that this directly contradicts some other reviewers' comments, but it is what I have observed.<br /><br />- Again in contradiction to several other reviewers' observations, no weevils or any other insect life form infested the box of Swheat Scoop.  It was perfectly lifeless!<br /><br />- Although the instructions advise acclimating cats to the new litter by putting a layer of the old litter to which they are accustomed on top, I switched the litter completely and suddenly, and both cats took to the Swheat Scoop immediately.  They had no adjustment problems whatsoever.<br /><br />- The instructions also advise that some household pets may look upon the wheat content as food and try to consume the litter.  However, my omnivorous canine, who would eat himself into oblivion if opportunity permitted, has never once attempted to nibble on the litter.<br /><br />In short, this is the cleanest, best-smelling, and most effective cat litter I have ever come across, and both cats took to it immediately.  I am thoroughly pleased with its appearance, odor, cleanliness, and performance. (And I can't believe that I'm actually writing a review of kitty litter, but this product is worth it!)  I'm not discounting the negative experiences which some other reviewers have reported, but I cannot explain them unless there are environmental conditions at work.  My first box of Swheat Scoop was purchased and used in semi-arid states low in humidity and with pretty low winter temperatures.  Were I in a wetter, warmer southern state, perhaps my experience and satisfaction with Swheat Scoop would have been different.

review/summary: A comparison to "World's Greatest Litter"
review/text: I have used World's Greatest Litter for a couple years, and saw this on the shelves.  So I decided to try it.  Here was the result:<br /><br />1.  Swheat Scoop is cheaper than World's Greatest<br /><br />2.  Swheat Scoop is more fun to say.<br /><br />3.  Swheat Scoop is less dusty than World's Greatest<br /><br />Now for the bad part:<br /><br />1.  I am very allergic to the dust Swheat Scoop causes<br /><br />2.  The clumping sticks like glue to the bottom of the box, no matter how deep I filled it.<br /><br />3.  The instructions on how to use it were in the bottom of the bag, which didn't halp until I'd already used most of it.<br /><br />4.  The litter tracks much worse than World's Greatest, since the clumps are harder, they stick between paws easier, and are transported to all areas of the house.<br /><br />5.  The litter is harder, so when you step on a tiny clump with bare feet, it hurts more.  Only thing more painful is Litter Pearls.<br /><br />So overall, I am not impressed.  Your mileage may vary.

review/summary: Beware the Meal Bugs - Forever!
review/text: Because this litter is a wheat product, it attracts meal bugs.  My bag actually came with the bugs in it - when I opened the bag, left it in the bathroom, and came back a few hours later, the bugs were crawling out of the bag and up the wall.  I have done everything to eliminate the bugs.  Naturally I disposed of every crumb of Swheat Scoop.  But once you have these in your house, it is very difficult to get rid of them permanently, due to the life cycle of meal bugs.  You think you've eliminated them, and then a few months later, they're back.  Do not buy this product, even if you think it works great as a cat litter.  You run the risk of being plagued by bugs forever.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I was given a box of this when I purchased my kitten. He loves it and we love it. It scoops well, isn't dusty, is safe for kittens and isn't scented (I am chemically sensitive so this matters a lot to me). Even if he ate it it wouldn't harm him since it is just wheat. If I keep the minimum of 3" level in the litter pan it doesn't stick to the bottom. I've been amazed at how well it scoops. I just scoop it morning and evening and it doesn't get smelly at all.<br /><br />You may want to get this locally since, after shipping, the discount usually works out about the same.

review/summary: Bugs, Bugs, Bugs
review/text: I tried and tried to like this product, as I despise the clay based toxicity of most kitty litters, but there is one "con" that outweighs every "pro": BUGS. The first time I noticed what I believe are called wheat weevils, I threw away the litter in the pans and the fresh litter sealed in an airtight container, and cleaned EVERYTHING. I purchased new Swheat Scoop and, weeks later, past what should have been the next egg hatching cycle, I found what looked like millions of the bugs in a fresh box. They clearly are Trojan Horsing themselves into my life via the factory. I CANNOT get rid of them. I am having to have an exterminator come to my house and the company says I have to throw away all the grains in my home on top of it all. I have switched to a non-food based litter. I know that the invasion of these bugs is wholly due to chance, but I would like to warn those considering the purchase of Swheat Scoop: there IS a chance these bugs will move in and they  will do everything in their power to stay.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: I only recently bought a bag (a few days ago) and already feel good enough about it to write a review. All we've ever used is clay litter with all our cats over the past 15 years, and we were fine with it. It wasn't until the past couple of years or so that I became aware of the hazards of clay litter (causes respiratory problems in cats, dangerous for young kittens who haven't mastered the art of pottying [they step in their pee, litter clumps to the paws, kitten licks off litter and injests it, kitten dies]). But the healthier stuff is so expensive, and I believed that the stuff we were using was safe enough (we were buying relatively low-dust clay litter). Then we found another kitty on the streets and my brother had a baby, and we became aware of the smells of the litterboxes. There was a definite smell that we hadn't noticed before. So we started trying different stuff, like the 99% dust-free clay, which I still believe is the best of the clay litters. But the smell still remained, no matter how many fans you turned on or how often you used fragrance sprays. I pondered trying Feline Pine (great price at Walmart) or crystals but worried about how my cats would take to weird-looking "kibbles."<br /><br />So a few days ago we took the plunge and bought a bag of Swheat Scoop, which I'd been wanting to try for the past year, and the first thing I noticed when I poured it into a clean box (I didn't bother slowly converting it, the clay litter went into the garbage) was that there was no dust. And just 10 minutes later, the room was obviously much more, well, smell-free. As an experiment, we're using only one box with Swheat Scoop, in my bedroom, and the other two litterboxes downstairs still have clay litter. It's a great way to find out if a cat doesn't like the new stuff without the cat pooping on the floor in a corner because she feels there's no other choice. Plus, being in a small room, it'd be easier to smell anything. So far, the results are obvious. The downstairs stinks, but the upstairs, even the bedroom in particular, is smell-free. Fortunately for me, my bedroom is right across from the bathroom, so I don't have to worry about treking across the house several times a day to clean the box. This is my favorite part, that I can flush it. My back is in heaven! My knees are thanking me! My skin has stopped crawling! All I have to do is bend over, scoop up the poop or pee clump and go to the bathroom and chuck the waste into the toilet. If needed, I return to the box and repeat the process. It's definitely much better than kneeling down and trying to breathe while scooping dusty poop and pee into a bag, then hauling the thing outside (I don't think it was ever an option having exposed poop and pee lying in a garbage can inside the house, lol). I don't know yet if there is a difference when it comes to completely cleaning it out, that is, by dumping out the litter iself and starting over fresh. It must be, because now I don't have to fret about where to put the litter (can't distribute it in the alley driveway, since when it rains, a mess ensues, and if I put it in a bag and put it in the garbage by the back door, you get attacked by the offending smell when you leave or enter the house). Maybe I can dump the Swheat Scoop into the garden at the front of the house, but it'll be at least a few weeks before I have to decide, so we'll see what happens.<br /><br />As for clumping, it works great. It takes a little bit longer for the clumping to actually clump than clay does. When Molly (the newest cat in the family) tried out the litter during the first day we had it, she peed and then tried burying it, but she's a vigorous digger, so she started digging THROUGH the pee, which hadn't clumped yet. So I had to stop her and wait for teeny tiny clumps to form so I could get as much pee out as I could. But if the cat avoids distributing the pee throughout the whole box because she's paranoid about not burying it, everything is fine. Just wait 5 minutes (or less! I haven't exactly timed it yet, lol) and it'll be clumped well enough to move it to the toilet. So far as I can tell, Molly uses it the most, but I don't think Willow has tried it yet (she has sensitive toesies, so I really think she'll like it once she tries it) and I think Buffy has used it only once. SOMEBODY besides Molly has used it at least once already, because the poop I found in there yesterday wasn't the mushy poop that comes from Molly's sensitive tummy. And it's possible that Willow has peed in there by now because I found a Willow-sized clump of pee last night.<br /><br />All in all, I've VERY satisfied with Swheat Scoop and I think it'll be worth the jump in price to keep using it.

review/summary: No good for automatic litter boxes
review/text: I have been trying various cat litters that are made from things other than clay, so that my cats have less impact on the environment and so that I can flush everything down the toilet.  I tried World's best cat litter, which is basically just toasted cracked corn, and it worked quite well, even in my automatic litter box.  However, it's expensive - about [...] a pound.  You end up spending close to [...] a month for litter for two cats.<p>So when I saw Swheat Scoop for about half the price I thought I'd try it.  It was similar to World's Best in that it's made from wheat so it's flushable and natural.  Only problem is it works horribly in the automatic box, although they claim it can be used there.  The cat's liquid waste turns the litter into a pasty, sticky gob that sticks to the litter box bottom and/or to the rakes when they come by to clean the box.  It simply isn't worth the price savings if you want a natural cat litter, at least if you have an automatic box.  I guess it would be passable if you have a conventional litter box.

review/summary: A Life-Changingly Awful Product
review/text: Holy Mother of God.<br /><br />I experienced this affront to all five senses via my girlfriend, who had, admirably, attempted to use an enviro-friendly product to collect her cat's bodily excretions. While it may or may not be friendly to the outdoors, it fails horrifically as a cat litter.<br /><br />1. Clumping. If, by "clumping," you mean "forms a heavy, dough-like glutenous paste," you have found your litter. The back of the box, where Calvin piddles, was instantly and constantly filled with a reeking, lava like mudslide, of such dense and sticky consistency that it was nearly impenetrable to a standard scoop, and clung tenaciously to the wall of the box. It was like making a modeling clay from heavy sand, flour, and corn syrup. Two scoops valiantly gave their lives trying to pry this nightmare from it's perch.<br /><br />2. Odor. Now, let's establish something. I have a high tolerance for messes. I've worked in food service, hauling Summer-ripened bags of trash, half food waste, half cashew-sized maggots, dribbling their secretions across the floor, me, and anyone unfortunate enough to get near, for a period of years. Not my fondest memories, but I dealt, heck, I got a kick laughing at my fellow employees if their constitution prevented them from lending a hand.<br /><br />That said, this product generates a hellish stench. The box was scooped daily, or nearly so. I have no idea how the cat stayed in their long enough to commit his excretory functions. The smell of urine and ammonia battered my nose like a pro boxer built from pee. Of course, given the sludgy consistency (see #1), I was doomed to enjoy this assault for several minutes at an eye-watering stretch.<br /><br />The pee smell, however, was only the tip of the stinky iceberg.<br /><br />Ever gotten sick from over-eating, or maybe a plate of food gone bad? Say, for example, lobster. Dinner's over, you're thinking "mmm, tasty, butter-soaked, sweet lobster meat," when suddenly, your entire digestive tract is pummeled by several MMA expert bacteria strains, and you spend four hours in the bathroom, as your stomach competes with your large intestine in a race to wring out to total vacancy. The worst part: the overwhelming taste and smell of the digestive-fluid washed tainted lobster is clearly identifiable as your original meal, the sweet, greasy meat now blended with bile and the overwhelming aroma of your failing bowel. That will be the last lobster you order for a decade or two. This isn't a derail, there's a point upcoming:<br /><br />2(a). The odor. Just the stench of urine fertilized by wheat byproducts would be unbearable, but the olfactory insult to injury is that this is, in fact, wheat. You know, the stuff they make bread, noodles, pizza and so on from. The smell of raw, warm dough is comprehensively integral with the overall stench of this ghastly substance. Imagine for a moment, you came across a bread recipe: 2 cups flour, 1tsp sugar, 1 package of yeast, and 1 cup of warm cat urine. Mix well, and place in a warm oven to rise. Now, hover your head 10" over the bowl, while you exert yourself mightily trying to pry a silicon putty-like mass from the wall of a litter box without shattering your last litter scoop, your elevated respiration drawing the deadly waft of rancid bread into the base of your lungs with each gagging gasp. Good times.<br /><br />3. Everything else. It's absorbency is poor. A side effect of the piss-poor clumping is that the liquid waste spreads around, tying up a massive amount of litter. Price. Yay! It cost far more than regular litter to begin with, and you toss out half the box every day? Where do I sign? Dust. Fortunately, after scarring your sinuses with yeasty ammonia, powdered chaff is almost pleasant. Tracking. No advantage over regular litter.<br /><br />Avoid this trash, you are better off not keeping a box, and let your pets do what they will. It will take less time to clean the mess than the box, the smell won't be as bad, and you won't have to quit eating bread.<br /><br />I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

review/summary: Insect infestation from this litter
review/text: I had used this litter on and off for a couple years without any real problems, like a lot of other reviewers. But - like several others - I have had insects come out of a box I have purchased. They are very small, white, and look like dust. But when you look closely, you see that the dust is moving and is actually alive! I first noticed them on the edges of one of the litter pans, so I dumped the litter and bleached the pan. I didn't suspect the insects were coming from the litter itself, so I refilled the pan with the Swheat Scoop. After a day or so, the bugs had spread to the other litter pans, and then I saw that they had spread to the floor because they were on the litter that the cats had kicked out onto the ground. They even spread to detergent bottles that had been set on the floor and were on the trash can and in the vacuum! Bleach, insecticide spray, soap...nothing worked! I had to hire a professional exterminator. He discovered that the source was indeed the Swheat Scoop because he checked the box that I had been using and found eggs and insects inside. He said they were a type of pantry pest that was feeding on the wheat.<br /><br />So - bottom line: even though this litter was good and I liked it, all the stress and money I had to spend because of one insect-infested box (and the GROSS factor) is, for me, not worth taking the chance on this product again!!!

review/summary: Smaller bags = less dust
review/text: I switched the litterboxes in my home to Swheat Scoop with the rabbit's safety in mind, but it has also done very well in controlling cat odors. I generally use a liner, but I've not had much trouble getting solid bits at the bottom out when I don't. Then again, the main box is round, so there are no corners for dirty litter to stick to, and the plastic of the box is a slippery-type, so that could play a part in it.<br /><br />Those with concerns about dust in the litter should go with smaller sizes rather than the 40-lb. bags: because of they way they're packed and stacked, some in-bag grinding of the grain is inevitable.

review/summary: Pantry Beetles like it anyway...
review/text: I tried Swheat Scoop after our adopted stray produced four unexpected little kittens. Figuring it would be a safe training litter, we bought a big bag of it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- It has generally the same consistency as regular litter, making the transfer from "kitten box" to "big kitty box" much easier.<br /><br />- There seemed to be much less dust than with clay litter.<br /><br />- Flushable<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Takes awhile to dissolve in the toilet before you can flush<br /><br />- Clumps are gummy for a long time until they harden, which after, is like cement.<br /><br />- As mentioned by another user, there is a "fermenting dough" smell. I cleaned out the box every day, but with four kittens and a full grown cat, the smell was unavoidable. That, and it's just a really strange smell that makes people go "What IS that?" when they catch a whiff of it. Rather embarassing.<br /><br />- Pantry beetles! If you have larder or pantry beetles in your area and they overwinter indoors, watch out.<br /><br />In my case, they were just drawn to the box, and to the bag that held the clean litter. I'd find the beetles in every stage of growth, especially the larvae. It can be very hard to get rid of them, even if you keep your house meticulously neat, as they burrow down into the carpet where you can't see them. After doing a bit of research (I didn't know what they were and called them "dirtybugs") I found out that they like to get into grains. (Which explains why I found some once at my boyfriend's old apartment in a box of Wheat-Thins) So, clean the area, clean it often, and kep any extra littler in a covered bin.<br /><br />I give the product 3 stars because it's a natural litter that's not too different from regular litter, but it loses points for the "fermenting dough" smell and the bugs.

review/summary: Great stuff!! Cleaning litter box is easy!!
review/text: After trying and being disappointed with two other "natural" cat litters (Feline Pine and Worlds's Best) I tried Swheat Scoop. I was pleased from the very first day. It clumps far more tightly than World's Best so it makes scooping the clumps much less messy and leaves less stinky litter behind in the cat box. I made the mistake of not filling the box to 3" and I did have a slight odor problem for awhile, but since I realized I needed more litter, I have had NO problems at all. And with the previous litters, there were some days that I'd come home and the whole house smelled of cat box (I have a small house.) I have not had this problem AT ALL with Swheat Scoop.<br /><br />Pluses:  Natural, clumps tightly, very little dust, flushable, quite effective job of absorbing odors<br /><br />Minus:  For best flushable results you need to let the clumps soak in the toilet for 20 minutes before flushing. Not really a big deal, but I'd rather be able to flush right away.

I started using Swheat about 6 years ago when I discovered that the frequent asthma attacks of one of my beloved Persians were caused by the clay litter dust.  After I switched to Swheat litter, his attacks stopped completely.  Swheat reduces and/or eliminates litter box odor.  It is true that, after a day or so, the clumps get very hard, but to those that complain about that aspect I say:  Why do you wait so many days before cleaning out the litter box?  I clean out my litter boxes several times a day and I have neither problems nor complaints with the clumping process.  I would highly recommend Swheat litter to anyone who is considering switching from clay to wheat.

review/summary: Pluses & Minuses.....
review/text: I have 2 spayed, female cats. Neither are vigorous diggers, there are two large litter pans side by side. Neither cat is fussy about litter type.<br /><br />Pluses:<br />-- flushable (my top reason for use, I don't have trash service)<br />-- acceptable clumping (but I have never used the clay litters to compare)<br />-- non toxic & no lung choking perfumes (I am bothered by potent odors)<br /><br />Minuses:<br />-- cost<br />-- to eliminate odor you must add an additional product<br />-- for best results you have to clean box daily<br />-- cost (it's a byproduct of wheat production that is likely swept up off a factory floor somewhere, wrapped in a fancy brand name and sold at TOP DOLLAR)<br /><br />Notes & Suggestions:<br /><br />-- I have found that the urine sinks to the bottom and sticks there. If I tip the box so the dry litter is out of the way, then I can scoop out just the clumped litter and any granules that break off. This helps to reduce odor.<br />-- Every time after I scoop the box, I sprinkle baking soda over the top. I find that it sticks to the pee soaked clumps, so it must be replenished.<br />-- I don't put new litter in every time... instead I let the level get lower and lower. Then at the end of the week, I completely dispose of everything in the box, wash the box with diluted bleach and soap, refill with fresh litter.<br />-- Without baking soda, this stuff does small like warm bread that's been peed on... I can't imagine what the corn based stuff must smell like?! I have smelled corn based products (cat food, corn gluten fertilizer, chicken food & chicken poop which smells identical BTW, etc..) and they are revolting to me. Personal preference.<br />-- I pour my bags right into a galvanized, sealed can. I have not had any problems with insects. Although I can imagine that it would easily be an issue if it is not kept in a sealed container.<br />-- I did find evidence of a mouse getting into the litter box. I dealt with him, and do not have any mouse issues in my house. If you already battle with these creatures, it could be a concern.<br />-- If I leave the box more than two days without cleaning, I do experience the gooey state of clumping. This litter was a COMPLETE bust at my sister's house. She has 4 cats, 2 boxes and doesn't like to clean on a daily basis.<br /><br />POSSIBLE CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE:<br />--Today, when I picked up a new bag, and was griping about the cost and how cheap I am, the clerk at the feed store mentioned a cheaper alternative. Apparently they have a customer that buys chicken food, and uses that in her boxes. It's a grain based crumble that effectively works the same. The most compelling part being that 50# costs about $16.00, give or take. I got home, looked it up online and there are threads about how it works. I think I'll try that out next time.

review/summary: Best litter EVER
review/text: I have been using this product for many years and I love it. Every so often I try another brand, but I always come back to Swheat. The odor control (my main issue with 4 cats) is outstanding, and the clumping is just fine. A friend of mine has multiple cats in a small apartment had a terrible odor problem, but would not take any of my advice. She was recently hospitalized and so I have been caring for her cats. I switched the litter to Swheat, and guess what. Odor problem solved overnight.<br /><br />I have no idea what these bad reviews are all about. I would imagine if bugs are an issue in your area, they might be attracted to Swheat. I live in a large city and do not have a bug issue, and have never seen bugs in or around the bag. I have never experienced any gooey mushiness, but I am guessing that if you do not use the litter properly this might happen. Here's the thing, and this pretty much goes for any litter. You must fill the litter pan with several inches of litter (3-4 in) in order to gain maximum benefit. Otherwise, how is it supposed to clump properly, or control odor? Covering the bottom of the pan with 1/2 inch is not proper use of any litter.<br /><br />I cannot imagine anyone, with proper use of this litter, not loving it. Best litter ever, that's all there is to it.

review/summary: my cat nibbles it!
review/text: I wasn't totally satisfied with The World's Greatest Cat Litter re clumping and odor control, so I started transitioning to Swheat Scoop. Seemed great in terms of no dust and at least ok in terms of odor control, but both yesterday and today I "caught" my darling cat sniffing it a lot and then, to my horror, she nibbled a little bit. (Yesterday I thought maybe I was imagining it) Back to the drawing board...

review/summary: Not as good as I had hoped.
review/text: I tried this litter hoping to find a natural alternative to my current clay litter. It has a nice consistency but it's fairly dusty. After it's used, the urine sticks to the bottom of the litter pan so much that I really struggled to clean the litterbox! Feces were barely covered up and the odor control is non-existent. In fact, after one day of use, there was a strange sour smell that filled the room from this litter. This was even after the box was clean. I had just tried a pine litter which worked great for odor control but the urine didn't clump as hard. I will be trying World's Best litter next and definitely won't buy this again.

review/text: With a new wood floor, we're especially sensitive toward litter that tracks.  Thus far, this has been the worst.  Even with all the matts we have around the litter box, it tracks EVERYWHERE.  And its terribly dusty.

review/summary: Wow!!
review/text: We have two kittens and have been using The Worlds Best Cat Litter since adopting them.  I only had one problem with the WBCL, it didn't do much in the odor control department.  The whole house knew when a kitty went #2!! I saw the Swheat Scoop on the shelf at our local pet store and decided to try it.  It was almost $10 cheaper too.  After cleaning our litter boxes we refilled them with Swheat Scoop.  There was less dust and otherwise looked and felt the same as the WBCL.  The kittens had no objection to the new litter.  I was excited to see that this litter clumps harder and stays together when scooped.  And it works wonders on the #2 smell!! I will use the Swheat Scoop from now on!!

review/summary: A scoopable small animal litter!
review/text: I use Swheat Scoop as a litter for my rabbit, who is litter box trained. Before this, I have never been able to find a small animal litter that clumps. I love this product. I have never noticed an odor, an rabbit urine can be pretty stinky! If you are scooping your litter box every day like you should be doing, there is no problem with litter sticking to the bottom. I have zero complaints about Swheat Scoop!

review/summary: I have never used a better litter
review/text: I have had cats all my life and I have experienced all types of litters.  This one is great.  As long as you keep topping off the box as you scoop it, it stays pretty odor free.  It clumps well and is much safer for the cats.  I hate all those perfumed litters, it doesn't do anyone any good to mask animal waste smells with some awful chemical flower smell.  The best part of the litter is that I keep the boxes in the bathroom and all I have to do is scoop into the toilet, wait and flush.  No longer is the used litter sitting in a trash can waiting to be disposed.  I also turned my mom onto this litter and she loves it.  Great Job Swheat Scoop.

review/summary: swheatscoop for rabbits
review/text: One of my rabbits found the swheat scoop irresistable to eat and an impacted stomach has resulted with my rabbit now being in the hospital for the last few days, with this litter impaction located in her stomach. Subsequently I found out on a quick web search that there is information on this product and its detriment to rabbits, on the HRS, house rabbit society website, as well as several other online locations. I'm certain this product is great for cats however, and I would continue to use it for my cat if I didn't have rabbits.

review/summary: Having used this product for over a year, ...
review/text: I can say that it's a very good litter.  We have three cats, but I use the regular formula, not the multi-cat.  We keep the litter box in a 4' x 5' basement bathroom with the door usually closed (and a cat flap in the door for access).  We scoop it once a day.  We have never had a problem with odor or bugs.  With three cats, the 12 lb box usually lasts about two weeks, so while it may be more expensive pound-for-pound, it absorbs more liquid by weight than clay litter, so the cost difference disappears.  It's flushable, so you're not dealing with a wastebasket of clumps sitting for a week until trash day.  In response to some of the other reviews, yes, the clumps are softer than clay litter, but if you're dealing with a flushable product, you don't want rock-hard clumps clogging up your sewer pipes.  And if you're dealing with huge, gelatinous clumps, either you're not cleaning your litter box often enough or your cat has a kidney problem.

review/summary: Works the Best for Us
review/text: We tried Swheat Scoop strait off when we got our new kitten.  We liked it pretty well, but decided to shop around a bit.  We tried World's Best and were not impressed.  It was really light so she when she dug in litter box it ended up all over the ground, second, we did not enjoy the corn smell and did not feel like it masked odors as well as Swheat Scoop.  We next tried Feline Pine- we did not get through the whole box. It tracked everywhere!  Not to mention it did not clump at all.  So we are back to using Swheat Scoop.<br /><br />Reasons we like Swheat Scoop<br />-Controls oder wonderfully<br />-Does not track too much<br />-Is safe for little kitties<br />-Clumps well for easy scooping<br />-Is flushable!<br />-Is cheaper than other clay-free litters.

review/summary: Good but has some cons
review/text: My two Himalayans have been using Swheat Scoop for about three years now and it definitely has some pros and cons.  I truly do not think there is such thing as the perfect cat litter and you just have to decide which product is the best for you and your kitties.<br /><br />I was using Fresh Step and was worried about the chemicals and clay dust.  My cats are pretty easy going and will use anything I put out for them.  I didn't start them off slowly or mix cat litters. Instead I changed one box (I have two) to the Swheat Scoop to see if they'd go for it and they began using it immediately<br /><br />I am not nearly as diligent as I should be about cleaning the box. My cats are not siblings but they do the same exact things in the cat box (maybe it's the breed). Neither one will cover up what they do. This is kind of gross but the turds sit on top unless I go in and cover them. Thankfully they aren't super stinky so that's not really a problem for me. If I cover up the turds the litter doesn't really stick to it, it just sort of dries it out a bit. When I go to scoop them out, not much cat litter comes with them. They're like little rocks that I fish out.<br /><br />My cats also like to wee in the same spot on top of each other's pee. This is drawback number one. They never pee in the middle of the box, it's always right up against the side. They'll do it so much that it doesn't really clump but turns into a wet mushy mess. The loose clumps break apart easily and you really can't use a slotted scoop to get them out. I have a little plastic shovel it use to remove it. This is only when i let the cat box go for a few days. Every once in a while I have the opposite problem. They'll surprise me and go on the far side of the box and when I go to scoop it's like other reviewers have said, like wet cement. You almost have to chisel it off.<br /><br />Now on the odor control I have two issues.  If I don't clean as often as I should, there can be a strong ammonia odor after two or three days. It's a make your eyes water, burn your eyebrows off kind of smell. Mind you my cats pee in the same spot so my guess is that the litter can't really handle that. I tried the multi cat formula with the same results. It can be very bad and makes the task of cleaning the litterbox that much more unpleasant. I originally thought there was something wrong with my cats but my vet assured me they had no problems. The fix is to scoop every day and maybe several times a day. The other issue I have with the odor is probably more a mental thing for me. If I clean the box diligently (before the ammonia smell sets in) the cat box smells like Cheetos (the orange puffed cheese snack). It's very weird and has put me right off eating them (the Cheetos, not the litter). I would imagine it's because of the starch in the litter but I find it rather strange.<br /><br />The price is pretty reasonable. I buy the 14-17 lb. bags from PetsMart and it ranges in price from $9.99-11.99 depending on if I catch a sale. I live in the DC metro area so not sure if this is comparable to other areas. They sell a 40 lb bag but I'm a weakling and can't lift it by myself. This stuff is heavy. It's lighter than clay but still heavy. I like the 17 lb bags the best but they only have those sporadically.  I find the the 17 lb bag fills up my very large cat box nicely.  Or, one bag 14 lb plus a bit more will do the trick.  I can get it to last about one month before emptying, bleaching and refilling the box.<br /><br />This stuff tracks pretty badly but I've never had a scoopable cat litter that didn't. I sweep/vacuum it up daily which cuts down on some of the tracking. It's not fun to walk on since it's hard but it cleans up pretty easily. My box is in the bathroom so I probably track it more than my cats do.<br /><br />You can flush it but I don't do that since my toilet is low flow and clogs occasionally. I dispose of it in the trash. It's a little dusty when you first pour it into the cat box but not once it's in there.<br /><br />I did get a bag with bugs in it a while back and I didn't realize what they were or put two and two together. After reading other reviews I gather they were the wheat weevils. As soon as I saw the bugs I emptied the cat box, swept up the mess and used a fresh bag. Didn't have a problem with bugs after that.<br /><br />Overall this is a good product but don't expect perfection. For the price I feel like it's a good fit for me. My cats seem to like it, it's natural so I don't have to worry about them ingesting toxins and it cleans up pretty well if I stay on top of it. The price is reasonable and I can find it at some grocery stores now. I would reccommend trying it and seeing how you like it.

review/summary: Highly Recommended!
review/text: We have 7 cats (all rescues) (all indoors only).  I switched after being extremely dissatisfied with other brands of litter.  The chemically-perfumey smell of the other brands were sickening to me, I can only imagine how much my cats hated it!  And the nagging doubt of what these chemical additives may be doing to my cat's health also helped me look for a better alternative. THANK GOODNESS for Swheat Scoop!  I (and kitties) LOVE IT!  Encounter a problem at the onset with litter adhering like cement to bottom of box, BUT researched on line and found out that a BOX OF BAKING SODA sprinkled on the bottom of the clean box FIRST, before pouring in litter, SOLVES the problem!  SO simple!  Occasionally I get a bad bag or two (sunflower seed husks included, moldy kind of smell, etc) but for the MANY years I have been using this product, I'd say it's been 98% smooth sailing!  And when I do (very rarely) find something wrong, customer service is courteous and responsive to my concerns.  GREAT product.  GREAT company.

review/summary: No odor, flushable, easier to clean
review/text: Basically the title says it all. I read one review that said it was hard to remove from the bottom and sides of the litter box. I had the opposite experience. It's extremely easy to clean. I use a scooper and scoop out clumps and dump them into the toilet and flush away. No more bagging and smelly outdoor trash cans. It scraps off the bottom of the litter box very well, and very cleanly, leaving little behind. I used to use bags, but they usually wind up with holes anyway so now I just use the plain old litter pan with no bag and it's much easier to clean.<br /><br />In my experience, it does take a little longer to form clumps. Usually I don't even wait for that and just scoop out soft clumps and flush. Kitties have to have a very clean litter box or they'll eliminate anywhere except the litter box. I have two cats and wind up scooping 3-4 times a day. I keep it in the bathroom next to the toilet, so it's pretty convenient. It never clogs my toilet because it breaks up in the water and goes down easily.<br /><br />There is odor immediately after one goes poo, and if I'm home I just go clean it out immediately if I smell something. If I come home and find they've pooped, I'm pleasantly surprised because my house smells normal.<br /><br />My favorite perk of this kitty litter is that it's flushable. Second would be no perfume smell and no dust. I buy it in the 12 lb box and I've noticed considerably less dust than clay litter.<br /><br />You have to keep up with cleaning it, as with any kitty litter, but I've found this litter easier to clean and better for covering odors.

review/summary: I'd be hesitant to call it clumping
review/text: I'm between two and three stars on this one.<br />My cat likes to bury her business really well, I guess, so she digs around a little bit after she uses the litter box. So far, this has completely destroyed the clumping effect. Instead of one or possibly two, giant, hard chunks for each time she pees like I would get with clay litters, I get about 15 teeny tiny ones. Since there are so many and they're so small, its nearly impossible to remove completely with scooping, so I could see how it could start to smell bad (I haven't been using it long enough to tell.) Scooping even one 'session' up also takes quite a while.<br /><br />However, so far it has done fine to control smells and the litter itself smells pretty good. It seems a little dusty, but no more than the litter, and I like that there is no strip mining involved in harvesting this product. I prefer having a box of it in my house to a box of the perfumey, dusty, dirty clay litter.  Also, my cat doesn't seem to mind it at all.<br />Unfortunately, the poor clumping ability will probably cause the litter to get dirty much faster than clay and need to be thrown out. Because of this, I'll probably keep trying different brands.<br /><br />I do want to like it, though, so I'm kind of just holding out and hoping my cat will decide she doesn't want to dig through her pee anymore. Yeah right.<br /><br />And on the bugs: Swheat Scoops website addresses this. They assure customers that the bags leave their facilities bug free and they go into detail about the process they use to kill any bugs. They say that bugs can only infest the product from warehouses. Perhaps getting it from certain stores will be more bug-free than others?

review/summary: Am I doing something wrong?
review/text: I had to give this cat litter 1 star because of the HORRIBLE OVERPOWERING ammonia smell!  OMG!  I can barely clean it without wearing a face mask.  My whole condo smells of the strong cat urine it's horrible!  My eyes were watering and my nose was burning.  I cleaned out the box almost every single day.  Didn't have too many issues with the litter sticking to the box.  It does stick, but I got it all up pretty easily.  However, after just a few days the smell started.  In less than a week it was so bad I had to dump out the whole box.  This has happened 3 times now and I've tried adding other products such as baking soda and other cat deodorizers.  I haven't had problems with bugs, mice or anything like that.  Haven't noticed any dust.  The cats do track it everywhere all over the house.  I even found some in my bedroom down the hall this morning.  I have to vacuum pretty much every day.  If anyone has any advice for the horrible smell I would appreciate it!  I am just desperately trying to make it through the bag right now so I can move on to something else!  I am loving that I don't smell the poo at all, just the horrible urine which is now officially 100X worse!  I'd rather smell the poo again!  UGH!

review/summary: Swheat is better than Corn Litter!
review/text: I loved Swheat, but thought I'd check out the more-expensive alternative: World's Best corn litter.<br /><br />Both are a natural resource that supports our farmers.<br /><br />The wheat actually forms clumps that are as hard as rocks.<br />World's Best Corn Litter had slightly softer clumps.<br /><br />The wheat had an inert smell when new....but also never did start to smell for the 4 weeks it was in my two-cat's box.<br />World's Best Corn Litter has a yucky sour corn smell when new....and after just 3 days...it began to stink in the litter box. And yes, I'm at home all day so I scoop twice a day, sometimes more. Imagine how it would smell if it wasn't scooped very often, like so many cat owners do.<br /><br />Swheat was $8.99 for a big box at Walmart.<br />World best Corn Litter was $20 for a comparable size<br /><br />Swheat wins!<br />You may have just realized that World's Best (corn grain) litter is superior to clay and other litters....and it is. But Swheat (wheat grain) litter is superior to corn, if not just for the smell alone! Both right out of the box, AND after it's been pee'd in a few days.

review/summary: Swheat Scoop Is Pretty Sweet
review/text: Swheat Scoop absorbs liquid better than the original rock-type litter, keeps the litterbox smelling fresher than crystals and is much safer for the cats, my son and the environment than the latest super clumping, micro-fine, choke-on-the-dust stuff on the market.<br /><br />Yes, the litterbox still has the potential to stink but hey, look at what's going in that box! I have 3 adopted kittens that I am actively trying to plump up, so you can imagine what both of our litterboxes are like. However, I have noticed that by cleaning the boxes morning and night, the "stinky" is almost non-existent. I don't have to deal with the distinctive litterbox perfume overkill either (you know, the "pretty" smell).<br /><br />To ensure better clumping, take a note from those automatic cat boxes and do not scoop immediately after kitty goes potty. You do want to clean the box at least once a day, twice if you can manage it, because wet wheat litter will stick to the bottom of the box and/or bag just like the superfine clay type does. Not fun.<br /><br />As this is a natural wheat product, you do want to care for it a little more than traditional litter. Check the product as soon as you get home and then periodically re-check it just to make sure you don't have any uninvited and unwelcome little guests. You may also want to invest in some pantry pest traps, just in case, and place them wherever you plan to store the Swheat Scoop.<br /><br />There really isn't a "perfect" cat litter but I have to admit I was really tempted to give a five star rating. Two of my kittens are disabled and cannot control their hind legs very well. This means frequent accidents and sometimes a bit of shmutz. It is really nice to know that they aren't going to have super clumping clay clogging their little insides if they clean up before I get to them.<br /><br />Overall, I give Swheat Scoop a two thumbs up and a four star rating instead of five simply because of that slight bit of extra maintenance required.

review/summary: Best litter. Period.
review/text: In reading the other reviews here, I'm wondering why I've never had these issues with Swheat Scoop.  It is the only litter I'll use for my cat.  Why?  Because clay cat litters are dusty, that dust gets in the cat's fur and when licked, goes directly into their digestive tract... and clumps.  My vet has told me of many cats he's treated that eventually died from blocked digestive tracts, due to a build up of clumped clay litter.  He's also advised me that the litters with the "pearls" of silicone can, if ingested, cause seizures and other potentially fatal reactions in cats, so I won't use those either.<br /><br />Swheat Scoop won't do that, plus it's much easier on the environment, won't harm anything if you flush it, it keeps the odors away, and it works.  Now, to address a few of the complaints I've seen here...<br /><br />Yes, if you put this in a litter box without a liner, the clumps stick like glue to the bottom.  Simple solution... use recycled or biodegradable liners.  It makes cleaning simple, fast, and much less traumatic.  I would never think to put this in an automatic litter box, because it's wheat, which contains gluten, which gets very clumpy when moist.  But then, I'd never use any CLUMPING litter in an automatic litter box, nor am I one who would ever buy an automatic litter box, either.  It's not that difficult to change a regular box if you use liners.<br /><br />Regarding tracking and the litter getting stuck in kitty's paws... I've never had that problem with my cat.  Sometimes he'll kick a little of the litter out of the box, but nothing the vacuum cleaner won't handle.<br /><br />I have used this for years and never, ever got any with bugs in it... nor have I ever had any issues with bugs getting in it after I opened it at home.  As for directions being found in the bottom of the container... it's simple... you empty the litter box, put in a new liner, fill it with Swheat Scoop about two inches deep, and you're done.  Very simple and very logical.  I scoop and flush the solid waste, then just lift liner and all out when fresh litter is needed.<br /><br />There is so little dust from this litter, you could probably call it dust-free.  However, I would think that anyone allergic or sensitive to wheat or wheat products would risk a reaction to the small amount of dust it makes.  I have all kinds of allergies (though not to wheat) and never once has Swheat Scoop adversely affected me, though.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is the only litter I feel safe using for my cat... it's the one my vet recommended, it's safe for the environment and the plumbing, and it's the only one my cat actually likes now, too.  Swheat Scoop has a customer for life here!

review/text: I've used almost every brand on the market. This stuff IS the BEST. When I clean the litter box I don't sneeze anymore. That is a big deal to me. I used to sneeze for up to a half an hour after cleaning the litter box when it was the clay litter. This stuff is SO good that I forget to clean the litter box because it just doesn't stink. I find myself needing to write reminders.

review/summary: Great for kittens!
review/text: If you're looking for a good litter to use with kittens, Swheat Scoop is hard to beat.  Unlike clumping clay litters, this is safe to use with kittens.  Yes, there are other clumping litters out there that are also safe for use with kittens, but Swheat Scoop seems to be the least expensive.  I was impressed with how very, very little dust this litter contains.  It's unscented, which I suppose is really a matter of personal preference, but a major plus for those with sensitive noses.  The downside: it doesn't clump quite as tightly as clumping clay litters, but when you've got kittens, it's better than no clumping at all!  And yes, it also does track more than clay litters.  As for forming hard-to-remove globs on the sides and bottoms of the box, I scoop our box daily (we have 4 three-month-old kittens) and haven't experienced any such problems.  Maybe it's because I clean the litterbox so often, maybe it's because a kitten's tiny bladder can't possibly hold that much fluid, but whatever the reason, scooping daily with 4 kittens, I haven't had to chisel any hardened globs from the sides or bottom of the box.

review/summary: My Experience
review/text: I have 2 cats and was looking to get away from clay litter for health reasons (long-time ScoopAway user).  I am a regular scooper - every other day, two days max.  I feel this is reasonable.  I have tried crystals, Feline Pine, and SwheatScoop.  At first SS worked great - great odor control AT FIRST, little dust AT FIRST, but now after 3-4 months of regular scooping I am noticing stronger odor than clay and MUCH more tracking than clay - and some dust!  It doesn't matter how much litter is in your pan: cats like to dig!  One of my cats is a very enthusiastic digger - cats WILL dig to the bottom of the pan, or close to it - and this stuff is MORE DIFFICULT than other products to remove from the bottom of the pan.  I have a mountain range forming at the bottom of the pan that I regularly have to chisel down with a chisel - the scooper won't do.  I am hoping World's Best performs better, but I'm not getting my hopes up.

review/text: Without SWheat I would have had to give up my companions.  My cats help me keep my sense of humor, make me laugh, and purr in bed.<br /><br />I am profoundly sensitive to chemicals.  All other kitty litters have chemicals in them.  You might not be able to smell them as they use another chemcial to cover up the smell.  My body can sense these chemicials.<br /><br />My cats adjusted quite well to SWheat but they do complain because I don't use as much at a time as I used to.  That has been their only complaint.<br /><br />Since I am unable to leave my apartment due to the toxic air it has been a blessing to have Amazon.com.  I can have my SWheat delivered to my basement apartment which means someone else carries that 40 pounds down 16 steps.

review/summary: Dust and respiratory issues
review/text: My wife and I have used this product for some time now.  When it first came out, they claimed no dust.  Well, there was always dust, but because it was natural and scooped, we decided to keep using it.  This was a big mistake.  This litter tracks all over the house and has ruined 2 vacuum cleaners because the dust is so fine it bypasses the bag and enters / cloggs the motor mechanisms.<br /><br />We have 3 cats that all are suffering terribly from respiratory issues caused by the dust from this litter.  If you don't believe that there's dust, as some of the reviews have claimed, then just simply OPEN YOUR BLINDS on your windows, allow the sunlight to come into the room / the boxes you're scooping,  and then scoop it,  or move it around in the box.  You won't believe the huge amount of micro-fine dust that billows out of the boxes.  You can't see these "dusts" in standard interior light, but if the sun is bright enough shining through the window, it's amazing how far up this stuff travels.  Imagine being inside a box, scratching away @ this litter, and breathing in all that dust.  No wonder why our cats always appear sick.<br /><br />Google Swheat Litter and respiratory issues and you'll find others who've had the same problem.  I've caused my cats enough grief, and we're switching to something better.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I'm editing my review without changing anything written above, as I've read more of the other reviews posted here about how "wonderful" this cat litter is. I need to reiterate my thoughts, so whomever buys this product gets to make a better "educated decison" for themselves on how "wonderful" it is ...based upon factual evidence that they can create and see for themselves, and not just go by some BS review of praise.  Yeah, it clumps, and it saves money, but there's more to it than that.<br /><br />Buy a bag or box or whatever size you like of the litter.  Put it in a cat box, and let it sit for a day, hour, week.... it doesn't matter.  OPEN YOUR BLINDS ON YOUR WINDOW AND SHAKE THE BOX IN THE SUNLIGHT !  Move it around with a SCOOP !  do whatever it takes to make the stuff move around in the box, short of throwing it around.  WATCH THE DUST BILLOW UPWARDS like a cloud rising up from a fire.  You won't believe it.  These particles are so "micro-fine" that they lift upwards and into your face as you're scooping. Now imagine how your cat is doing, being right in there in that dust.  You can't see the dust, as it's too fine, unless you move it around in sunlight.  You'll be horrified at how much it just billows up out of the box.<br /><br />After trying this "test", you can now make your own decision based upon your results that you see before you.  Personally, I'm tired of constantly bringing my cats to the vet for respiratory problems.  They're indoor cats that aren't exposed anything but this litter.  Since we switched to a "pine pellet" type, our house has stayed clean, and our cats are back to breathing normally.  Id never use the swheatlitter again.<br /><br />Nuff said.

review/summary: Moth Invasion in each box!
review/text: Not at all happy with this product. Although it controls odors well, urine clumps turn into a gooey, sticky mess that is near impossible to scrape off the bottom of the litter box.  Worse than that, the litter frequently comes infested with moth larvae.  I thought I got unlucky with the first box so I threw it out and decided to try another, from a different pet store. No luck - the second box was also infested with larvae, which, within a few days of pouring the litter into the box, had crawled up the walls, uncubated and turned into moths. I'll never buy this product again.

review/summary: Great litter for people with certain allergies
review/text: Obviously, if you have a sensitivity to wheat, this would not apply to you. But as an asthmatic, I find litter box cleaning with clay litter to be unbearable. I end up coughing and wheezing from the dust and chemical perfumes. Luckily, this has never been an issue with this product. I started using Swheat Scoop in 2007, maybe before that, and I have never had any issues with dust or bugs.<br /><br />Frankly, the bug issue is not as big of a deal as I have been reading in other reviews. This is exactly what can happen with all-purpose flour too. These bugs are notorious for finding their way into pantries, and I am sure they can get into this litter if improperly stored in a warehouse. Just treat this litter like you already should be handling flour, wheat bread and similar food in your pantry, which is a place that is much more likely to have meal worm issues.<br /><br />The clumping is not the same as with clay litter. That is, the clumps don't form into one neat ball. But I don't find it hard to clean the box with this litter. It does actually clump and only forms a bunch of little balls as someone mentioned if you break it apart with the scooper. I use a very large scoop to prevent that. As for the smell, there is barely any scent to the litter itself and it only stinks if you are cleaning your box any less than once a day, which is not enough for any type of litter. The website actually had a couple of tips for clumping: adding cooking spray or a sheet of wax paper to the bottom of the box and sprinkling a bit of baking soda to help with clumping and odor.<br /><br />Since there are pros and cons to everything, you really have to weigh what you would rather deal with. In my experience, I would much rather deal with litter that does not clump neatly into one ball than with dusty, perfume-y litter that makes it hard to breath.

review/summary: New Cat Owner In Love With SWheat Scoop!
review/text: I'm a relatively new cat owner and admittedly have not used any other litter but this.<br />I was attracted to the fact that it's not clay, clumps and is flush-able.<br />Admittedly the odor isn't completely masked as they claim, but since we regularly scoop when home, and as long as we clean it every week and put in fresh litter, the smell is only notable if you put your face in the box.<br />Most importantly, our cat seems to like it, and in the month we've had her, she's had no adverse reactions to it (ie. no UTI problems).<br /><br />We live in a small apartment where space is limited. We bought a covered litter box, removed one of the doors from our under sink cabinet and put the box in it.<br />The fact that it's a covered box, in a cabinet, helps prevent the litter from tracking all over the place. The downside is that since our space is so small, we DO have to vacuum every time she uses the box, otherwise WE would be tracking it through the apartment!<br /><br />As far as reports of bugs, we haven't seen any evidence of a problem.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />1) It's a great alternative to clumping clay litter (which can be harmful for your cat)<br /><br />2) There is some clean up necessary after your cat uses the box. Keeping a textured floor mat at the base of your litter box helps prevent it from "traveling".<br /><br />3) Odor coverage is minimal, but a good diet with the least amount of filler helps waste odor.<br /><br />4) I personally have not seen evidence of bugs of any sort.<br /><br />I hope this helps other first time cat owners!

review/text: The litter is great -- clumps well, keeps smell down, the cats are happy with it. However, one of my cat's is a litter kicker and so it is everywhere (all over the house).  I have tile on the floor the litter box is on and the little granules (like sand but a little bigger) get into the grout and have eventually worn some of the more traveled areas down (some of the grouting is almost gone).  I've used Swheat Scoop about a year and half.  I sweep regularly but as I said, my cat is a kicker.  The other cat is just a magnet for any litter and carries it everywhere.  Ever have cat litter in your bed?  Yeah, you will if you use this.  I have mats and take all the precautions possible but it still happens.<br />I still buy it because it works but I'm looking for other alternatives for the sake of my floors.

review/summary: Works with my electronic litter box!
review/text: After being fed up with the disgusting smell of clay litter and it sticking to the litter pan like glue when it got too wet, I found this litter and I'm never going back! I tried corn litter before this but it was no comparison in terms of clumping, tracking, and keeping the area odor free. Believe it or not, I use this litter with two cats in my electronic litter box...it works GREAT! If there is ever a possibility that it gets oversaturated and sticks to the bottom of the pan, it dries to a cakey consistency and I just scoop it out in seconds. With clay clumping litter my cats were tracking that litter smell all over the house, I was constantly getting a whiff of it on them too. Now, theres no odor to speak of on them or in the house and theres minimal clean up. Better yet - its natural and safe for my kids and the environment. As far as completely odor free and not enough clumping power - that would be some magical stuff to be able to de-oderize cat waste completely. . .this makes it barely noticeable though. The electronic litter box does scoop it away almost immediately so I'm sure that helps and it definately seems to have enough clumping power to be scooped away electronically.

review/summary: Doesn't work well with Litter Robot II
review/text: Ah the controversial Swheat scoops litter!  Does it breed bugs?  Does it stick to the bottom of litter boxes?  Do pets gorge themselves on it?  You won't know until you try it in your home with your animals.  However, know this...  One of my cats love sleeping in it!  Ok now that I have your attention, keep reading.<br /><br />From my own trial and error instead of reading the instructions, Swheat Scoops likes to be used with a deep layer of about five or six inches or so in a normal box.  Otherwise, you get that odoriferous oatmeal cookie dough consistency stuck to the bottom of your litter box.<br /><br />The Litter Robot II doesn't work well with Swheat Scoops litter.  Unlike a conventional litter box, you can't simply add more than the recommended litter to the Litter Robot II.  If you add too much litter, the excess gets dumped into the waste receptacle.  And there in lies the problem.  Since the litter isn't deep enough, the cookie dough sticks to the flexible rubber bottom of the globe!  The cookie dough sticks so well to the rubber, that when the rubber flops out when the globe is fully inverted, the cookie dough won't let go!  That's sticky...  and Stinky too.<br /><br />So folks with normal boxes, double up the depth and you'll be fine.  People with Litter Robot II's, don't use it or you'll end up taking a litter scoop to your globe.  Quite ironic since didn't you want to stop using a litter scoop when you got your Litter Robot II?  Also, I noticed that my normal litter scooper didn't sift the excess swheat scoops too well.  It felt like I was tossing out a lot of the good with the bad.  So maybe a scoop upgrade is necessary too.

review/text: We have used Swheat Scoop for 6 or 7 years now for our 2 cats.  I love it for them because I don't have to worry about asthma from the clay dust, that gross perfume smell, or intestinal blockages from licking their fur, or REALLY bad news if a dog gets into the box for 'cat treats'.  (Ok, the dogs do get diarrhea from eating too much wheat litter, but no intestinal blockages from clay!)<br />  I don't think it tracks more than other scoopables, but we also have it in the basement.  AND, you can spray your cleaned box with nonstick coating like Pam, and that will really help with sticking.  Also, I just tilt the scoop back and forth gently or use a small vibration technique to sift the loose litter and this way the clump stays together well. Don't use big side-to-side shaking.<br />Use Swheat Scoop - there's lots of wheat out there!!

review/summary: Good Litter with some problems
review/text: I changed from a clay litter because of the amount of dust to the Swheat Scoop.  The SS has less dust than clay and it can be flushed down the toilet, however there are some drawbacks. I use the Omega Paw litter box with 3 inches of litter.  It does stick to the bottom with even 3 inches of litter, but with this type of box, I can bang the outside of box when it is upside down to free the bottom clumps. A good litter mat reduces the tracking outside the box.<br /><br />I feed my cats EVO and Wellness cat food but one cat has really stinky poo that overpowers the SS litter, so the odor control is average.  I learned to never feed Fish cat food to a Siamese cat, the odor is seriously bad. The extra strength Ever Clean worked better for poo odors, but it's very dusty and not flushable.  So far, I've have not noticed any bugs or mice getting into the litter box but it wouldn't surprise me if it happened due to the wheat.<br /><br />Plan to try the Feline Pine for a month with the Omega Paw box and see which one works better for minimizing fecal odors.  Since the litter box is near our bathroom, I would rather have a flushable, clumping litter.  I will use Arm and Hammer to control the odor and find ways to work around the stickiness and pest problems.

I have tried every kind of clay, clumping cat litter on the market, and most recently a corn Arm & Hammer one (which is horrible!) and then tried this one.  I have 2 kittens, so I think all they do is sleep, play, and poop.  They took to it well. It clumps great, I sprinkle baking soda in after scooping.  It still smells much less than other brands, and I LOVE that I can just flush it and not worry about disposing of a bag of cat poop along with the already gross litter box!  I use the multi-cat one, and I like it!  Worth the extra cost.

My cat does not become trained to do something that he does NOT want to do. It's just not possible. Have you ever tried to train any animal? So, now the cat is Not BORED, nor is he underfed. ha ha, now he gets soft canned cat food or bonito tuna flake treats for accomplishing his Toilet training "trick".<br /><br />Swheat Scoop is flushable... and it works great for Toilet training your cat!  There are photos and I have a video. No, I did NOT use some expensive store bought device. I used an old ice cream bucket! (It has an easy to use handle to remove from the T for human use!)<br /><br />I love my cat!<br /><br />And I LOVE this cat litter! If the cat is ever sick or injured, we will go back to this litter! It really is wonderful! The price is amazing! Personally, I think one uses far less of this litter than the really old fashioned clay kind. I have no experience with the new clay kind. 13 yrs ago, I did briefly try the paper litter before this came out though. THis stuff is great!<br /><br />I have a video on YouTube, I'm not sure what I signed away in the agreement box, so they  may own my video. My name is NLGHTgirl on there.<br /><br />PS. In all fairness, the curious puppy tried to eat the organic home made local Farmer's market Goat Milk soap as well!! ha ha! I stopped her though!

review/summary: very much like a dubble bubble
review/text: I ordered this product thinking it would be really good but it wasnt. First off its very hard chew to begin with. Second the taste is so-so; the main taste is really the taste of every generic bubble gum flavor but there is a sub taste which is actually pretty good. However, I wouldnt buy this again- in my eyes this is as bad as that regular dubble bubble chewing gum.

review/summary: GLUTEN FREE!  So good, I had to review it!
review/text: BOTTOM LINE:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  This stuff was sooo good, I really wish I had another bowl right now. The Quantity:Price ratio takes the product down one star.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I thought the flavor was excellent, in that I could really taste the garlic, pepper, and onions.  The broth was a little salty at first, but I added a bit more water to get it to where I wanted.  I also thought it could use a little spiciness, but I feel that way about everything (I left out their oil packet and added a squirt of my own Hot Chili Sesame Oil - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZXXWM">House of Tsang Hot Chili Sesame Oil</a> and it was perfect).  It was really nice in that it had more than just your standard chicken/ msg broth flavor - it had real subtle flavor notes.<br /><br />NOODLES:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  I thought I would note that I really like the noodles in this - they are not your standard Ramen noodle, but are a form of rice noodle, similar to Vietnamese Pho.  These take a little longer to cook, but are definitely a great match for the broth.  I bought them because they are gluten free, but they make a great soup noodle in their own right.<br /><br />QUANTITY vs. PRICE:<br />I wish there was more in the bowl than what was provided.  This is what takes the product from 5 stars down to 4.  For the price, I wish there was more food - or for the amount of food, I wish it was cheaper.  To be fair, I bought this at my supermarket, and not on here, but the price is similar.

Honestly, I would give 10 stars,  but have to be honest, this thing is total danger to your waist line. Once you start nibbling, you cant stop!!! I don't even know how many calories in one serving,  and I don't care to know it. I just want to eat it and enjoy it.<br />Life is to short to eat booooorrrrring wafers! Get Kras Napolitanke!

review/summary: Tips on Yeast starters
review/text: Chlorine kills yeast;  You didn't use tap water did you?<br />Champagne yeast is a slower yeast. I would suggest creating a starter batch first.<br />Buy an Erlenmeyer flask and an airlock. (or a yeast starter kit.<br />Pitch yeast distilled non chlorinated water (your favorite bottled water) and yeast nutriant(Sugar) into the flask.<br />Apply the airlock to the top of the flask. Place in a dark place at around 70 - 75 degrees.<br />(A closet or pantry) Return in a few days, you should have a yeast culture ready to use!<br />(Throw the yeast into some apple juice!)  :)

review/summary: Great for rootbeer
review/text: The Red Star Champagne yeast is very similar to the Lavin EC-1118 yeast. Both are fast fermenting.  I have used both brands in making rootbeer. After leaving the plastic bottles at room temperature for 24 - 36 hours the bottles are rock hard. Once refrigerated the yeast go dormant and any further carbon dioxide creation is stopped.  The nice thing about these strains of yeasts is if a bottle of rootbeer goes flat all you have to do is screw on the top and give it a day for the yeast to re-carbonate the liquid. Then refrigerate and you have carbonated rootbeer ready to go.

review/summary: This yeast works great in CO-2 bio-reactors for planted aquariums
review/text: I use Red Star yeast in a bio-reactor for a densely planted aquarium. It works great for that purpose. The bio-reactor produces carbon-dioxide, which is tubed into the aquarium to help the aquatic plants grow. Bakers yeast (which you can buy in any grocery store) works too quickly.  This Red Star yeast consumes sugar at a slower rate than baker's yeast, which is what you want for an aquarium CO-2 bio-reactor. One packet will last a few months, because you only need to use about 1/5th of one packet for each refill of the bio-reactor.

review/summary: Fast Champagne Wine!
review/text: I took 2 48oz bottles of Welches 100% Grape Juice (to COMPARE this Champagne Yeast with baker's yeast that I used before.)  The Champagne Yeast made Wine in only 2 days (Room Temp 76-85 degrees) --- all the Sweet Taste gone & lots of bubbles.  Great!  The other bottle took 5 days & didn't taste as good.  To make the Wine, I poured off 15% from the each bottle & used about 1/3 packet of yeast & closed the top of bottle, then backed the lid off 1/4 turn, other wise the bottle explodes!

review/summary: Red Star Champagne Yeast (10 Packs) Dried Yeast
review/text: I purchased this product through Amazon to restart the fermentation process for orange wine. The yeast I began the process with failed to start. In looking for help I found this yeast that advertised as being good for restarting stuck processes. I had about 3 gallons of fruit to ferment. In order to save this I ordered this yeast. It took longer to get than other products I have ordered through Amazon, even after paying extra for expediting this ordered. I also paid more for this than I normally would but I paid the premium in hopes of saving the work already invested.<br />The yeast failed to restart the fermentation, however I don't know that it was the products fault.

review/text: It is so frustrating for me looking for real lemon curd. This stuff actually has a good smell to it but it is the same gelatinous mush that I see time and time again; it is not creamy at all. I read another review saying how a little goes a long way, that is a red flag. Real lemon curd is creamy and doesn't go a long way because it is fluffier.

review/summary: Best jam!  Everyone agrees.
review/text: I tried this jam based on a review I read on Amazon.  I thought such rave reviews merited a try.  I was not disappointed.  It was GREAT. Loaded with fresh summer berries the jam looks like something you'd see in a picture perfect photo in some great foody magazine.  The taste is equally appealing reminding me of some homemade treasure Grandma pulls out of her pantry or something served in a fine french bistro.<br /><br />We've tried it on toast, scones, pancakes, even vanilla ice cream.  We had 6 weeks of company this summer and I ordered a case for us all to enjoy.  Had to order another case before the last of my company left.  Most everyone wrote down the name so they could order it for themselves.<br /><br />Now after raving about this jam I have to let you know that I'm not a huge fan of jam but my family does enjoy it so we always have jam on hand.  Usually strawberry jam is their preference, in fact. But... THIS JAM made ME want to make toast for breakfast just so I could slather some on buttered toast.  Worth every penny.<br /><br />My only question is this... any thoughts as to what one could do with many cases of darling empty jam jars?  I think this could be a great country craft waiting to happen.

review/summary: Best Store-Bought Preserves I've Ever Had!
review/text: First, let me say I've never liked jelly - not even when I was a kid. Occasionally, I would eat my grandma's and my mom's homemade strawberry jam, as it tasted much different than anything that came from a store. As an adult, I decided to try some store-bought preserves and jams, but never found one that I liked. (I just can't stand the jelly-like consistency and the sickening sweetness they all have.) So I don't know what possessed me to buy a jar of this Bonne Maman Four Fruits Preserves one day, several years ago, while grocery shopping.  The cute little jar with the red & white gingham-look lid was what initially caught my eye. (I'm sure it's no accident that Bonne Maman's marketing department has given their packaging a homemade look.) I read the label, saw that it has 2 fruits that I like (strawberries and cherries), one I am not crazy about (raspberries), and one I'd never tasted (redcurrants). I bought it anyway, knowing that if I didn't like it, my husband would eat it. As it turned out, we both LOVE THIS, and it is now the only kind I buy! For a long time, this brand and this variety was not widely available in grocery stores, so I snatched it up whenever I could find it. I even bought several jars and gave to my family, just to introduce them to this fantastic product (knowing they all make their own strawberry jam and believed nothing else could be as good).<br /><br />Recently, I tried the Bonne Maman's "Strawberry Preserves" and "Cherry Preserves", and was surprised that I didn't like them. I felt they were just like every other store-bought preserves I've ever tasted. So I don't know whether it's the combination of these 4 fruits together that makes the "Four Fruits Preserves" so good, or if it's the flavor of the redcurrants - the one fruit that I've still never tasted other than in these preserves. I've read that redcurrants are quite tart, so maybe that is the secret - the combination of tartness and sweetness.  But whatever it is that makes it taste so good, I would bet it's a recipe that Bonne Maman guards like gold.<br /><br />The other reviews here are fairly old and at the time they were written, Bonne Maman products weren't available in very many retail stores. So, yes, the price to order it would be pretty high. But over the years, Bonne Maman preserves have slowly started appearing on more and more grocer's shelves, and in more and more different varieties. Where I live, Bonne Maman preserves (including the "Four Fruits Preserves") are sold in both of the grocery store chains, as well as Walmart and Target - and the price is very reasonable (around $4.00).
