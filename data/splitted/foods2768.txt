review/summary: Delicious and Nutritious!
review/text: Saw this on Dr Oz then started researching. Amazing superfood high in all the B Vits & C AND 16% protein. try Googling it. About this product, signed up for Subscribe and Save. Very good, plumper than when I purchased at local HFS. Sort of like a tart raisin in size, but with a little of a grit (seeds)like figs. The also have a property the thst seems to satisfy sugar cravings for a while. The fellows in the house (weight trainers w an eye on health) first turned up there noses due to tart suprising flavor. Now they are disappearing, only one 6 pack left out of my supersave delivery of 4  six packs!  Well I want my family to be healthy so better increase the frequency or number of bags!!!

review/summary: I love Kopali Products!!!
review/text: After purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIWUHG">Kopali goldenberries</a>, I tried a few other Kopali snacks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIRCZ6">chocolate covered cacao nibs</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIWUTE">chocolate covered banana</a>.<br /><br />The goldenberries are the best dried fruit I have ever had. They are bursts of sweet and tangy flavor and achieve the same satisfaction as sour gummies. Grown in Columbia, goldenberries are high in antioxidants, bioflavonoids, fiber, and even contain protein. They are a great snack and are somewhat filling.<br /><br />The dark chocolate covered nibs are also good. The small package contains a lot more nibs than it seems at first. The nibs are crunchy, high in antioxidants, and a little bit bitter, but the dark chocolate balances the bitterness nicely.<br /><br /> The chocolate covered bananas were also delicious. I expected them to be crispy, but instead they were chewy and a bit zesty. Each of the Kopali Organics products is a healthy and satisfying snack. You should try them (especially the goldenberries)!

review/summary: I mix them into steel cut oats for breakfast
review/text: I mix these into my oatmeal for breakfast.  They add a nice citrusy flavor and impart an interesting texture - a little chewy like a raisin, but with a little bit of grit.  I tried getting some golden berries from the local organic focused supermarket.  Their boxes, on two occasion, contained very hard, dried out berries.  The Kopali berried are much plumper.  I now prefer these in my morning breakfast compared to raisins or dried cherries or blueberries.

review/summary: Incredible
review/text: This product is unreal. I have a full-fledged amazon shopping addiction and have purchased some amazing products here - this is the first time I have ever been compelled to write a review. Not only are these golden berries delicious, they make you feel amazing. I eat one pack with my breakfast and start to feel the effects by noon. I'm talking mental clarity, sense of well-being, high energy...bottom line is I feel great! I eat goji berries, acai, all the superfood products and these are hands down the best quality, best tasting, and most effective berries I have ever come across. I got my friends and family to try these - one of my friends described them as "divine" - which sounds absurd, but honestly I get where they are coming from. They have the texture of a fancy raisin, but taste much more interesting. Sweet and tart. Highly addictive. Only problem is I get depressed when I run out. Honestly can't live without these now. Highly Highly bagillion stars recommend this.

review/text: i've never reviewed a product before, but i had to disagree with the previous review. this is the most intense earl grey you'll taste, with the possible exception of stash's double bergamot. a 'floral' earl grey usually implies lavender or something like that, but there's only a very intense bergamot added to this tea. tremendous flight, wonderful nose. i alternate between bigelow, the two stash earl greys, & this one, so that the flavours in each stay distinctive. sounds high maintenance, & it is, but this is tea! it's worth it.

review/summary: Gross tea
review/text: This tea is an affront to Earl Grey Teas. I've tried many Earl Greys, mostly from this site, but the is by far the worst Earl Grey I have ever tasted. It tastes very floral, and If the description had said that it was a floral tea I would not have bought it, but it says Earl Grey, and from any Earl Grey, I expect bergamot, not flowers. If you expecting an good Earl Grey, like Ahmads, or Tea Nation, do yourself a favor and avoid this one. This is closer to a Lady Grey than an Earl Grey

review/summary: LOVE THIS DRESSING
review/text: I'm in a points based weight loss program and have been at my goal weight for almost two years.  I can have pretty much all the vegetables that I want, but the dressings have to be counted against my alloted points for the day.  I was able to find low point dressings for most salads but not for cole slaw, so I thought this was something that I wouldn't be able to have any more.  Once I discovered Walden Farms dressing, we started to have cole slaw at least once a week again.  It also led me on to try different Walden Farms products and we found that we also like their Ranch and Thousand Island dressings and also their Pancake Syrup, which is especially good warmed up little bit in the microwave.  All of these have zero points value!!

review/summary: Winner! Winner! Awesome Dinner!
review/text: Howdy - I've used Char Crust for about 8 years or so... outstanding product!  Lots of rubs and marinades out there, but for ease, simplicity, and consistent taste this one tops them all.  I use this on fillet mignons and tenderloin steaks, pound them down just a tad to 1.75 - 2.0", dredge them in this Char Crust hickory seasoning, let them rest for an hour at room temp, and sear them in a big Lodge cast iron fry pan in a bit of butter and olive oil over med/med high heat for six/seven minutes a side... for rare, med rare.  I've never once been disappointed, and I've had dinner guests tell me their steaks were they best they've ever had anywhere, residence or restaurant.  Who knows, they may be lying, but I do know this is an outstanding product... I wish it were more widely available in stores.  I've also used the teriyaki/ginger and smokey southwest versions... like hickory the best... just ordered the hickory/molasses... seems like a can't miss.

review/text: Rich, Creamy, Delicious!<br />The taste and texture is irresistable. Read my review on the almond chocolate version, which this item is quite similar to. Except, I have to say this one is even richer and a favorite.<br /><br />PROS: Healthy, Low sodium, Vegan, Gluten free, Vitamins, doesn't have to be refrigerated, portable as juice box size, dangerously delicious. And amazon.com seems again to have the best price on this with free s&h for $25+ orders. The peel tab comes off so easily, even better than the almond version.<br /><br />CONS: If you have (i.e. kidney failure) restrictions, it has more protein than the almond version (which has 1g), and this one has 2g, though is still on the low side.<br /><br />Drink with delight!

It's creamy and the packaging is great for taking to work. I recommend this to anyone who loves hazelnuts and needs something different to drink.

Pacific's hazelnut non-dairy beverage is my third favorite.<br /><br />This product is sufficiently tasty, but seems to have a water-like consistency.  The cocoa powder is mixed in so you don't get lumps of grainy powder in your glass (sometimes, so delicious coconut milk chocolate has this problem).  There is a faint hint of hazelnuts but the chocolate is more pronounced than the hazelnuts.<br /><br />I frequently use this product with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GJ9JWS">PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz</a> to make chocolate peanut butter smoothies as a delicious, healthful treat.<br /><br />I recommend this product for those that are seeking a very good non-dairy chocolate flavored beverage.

review/summary: The Best Chocolate Pseudo-Milk I've Tried
review/text: I think that chocolate and hazelnuts combined are awesome, so I surely would like this product.  I've tried pretty much every variant of pseudo-milks, and I think this one is the best chocolate one I've tried.  Not that the others are bad; they aren't.  But this one has some superior qualities.  The flavor is great, and you can taste the hazelnuts; it's not just a syrupy sweet chocolate taste.  Also, the body of this beverage is lighter and more delicate than similar products.  It still is rich and creamy, but I think a big improvement overall.  I also find that this product is more satiating and refreshing than the others.  I haven't tried it hot, nor have I tried cooking with it yet; but I think both would offer great possibilities.

review/text: This is my favorite pasta. I get it at a local specialty store for the same price (minus the shipping). I was looking to get it from Amazon because all packages gets snatched very fast when they come in. Apparently I'm not the only one who loves this pasta.<br /><br />I prepare it with a creamy mushroom sauce.<br /><br />Note: Keep your cooking water for use in stews and other dishes, it's very fragrant and absolutely delicious.

review/summary: Real Scottish Oatmeal
review/text: I am a Scottish man living in America. Grandson of an Oatmeal Miller so I know a little bit about Oatmeal. This is genuine Scottish style Oatmeal ground between two stones to make a rough flour. What Americans call oatmeal isn't oatmeal its flaked oats.<br /><br />I had been hunting for oatmeal for years as I far prefer porridge made with meal over the flaked oats. It has a nuttier flavour and a better texture. Then I found this and was delighted. I recommend it to lots of people. If you want genuine Scottish oatmeal porridge, only add a pinch of salt, no sugar and serve with separate cup of milk. Take a spoonful of oats and then dip into the milk to cool. fair braw.

review/summary: Not Exactly Porridge...
review/text: This isn't exactly like the porridge that you find in Scotland but it is quite good. I've been searching for several months for the closest match to what you find in Scottish B and B's and this may be it. It cooks in 8 minutes (at very low temp) and it is important that you add the oatmeal to the boiling water slowly and while whisking. I also stir it at the halfway point to keep it moist and prevent scorching.<br />I usually eat it on some sort of breakfast cake that involves fruit, nuts and coconut so I don't add any extra sweetener. Just a dash of cinnamon.

review/summary: The best oatmeal I have ever eaten
review/text: I purchased this product because it was on a health food program and they featured it due to its high quality and good for your body.  I have always liked oatmeal but it took time to prepare as I did not like the instant.  I read the 'contents' of almost 100% of the food I buy as I have serious health issues.  This particular product is pure and simple GROUND OATS.  It is easy to prepare in a microwave (takes 4 min) or if you want to make a larger amounts (there is only me in my home) you can prepare it on the cooktop.  I add only a small amount of sugar and about 1/4 cup of half and half and it is smooth and delisious.  Sometimes I add fruit or nuts, not always as I love it plain.  I intend to buy more when I finish what I purchased.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Great Seller, Great Food
review/text: My 16-1/2 year old cat has had inflammatory bowel disorder under control for about 3 years now with Natural Balance limited ingredient diet venison & green pea canned food, and a small dose of prednisolone every other day.  She really enjoys it, and my other cat can eat the same food since it meets nutritional standards for all cats for daily use.  I usually buy it from a pet store in my community, but this food is presently in short supply.  The manufacturer has been without the venison for several weeks now.  Natural Balance has handled the situation well, providing information to its customers on how long they expect to be unable to deliver the food.  As a result, I was able to plan for my older cat and order enough of the food from several sources to get her through the shortage (unless it lasts longer than presently expected).  Given her age and the veterinary condition, it might have saved her life if it enables me to avoid having to switch her to another food.  All of the cans received were in good condition.  They arrived on time.  And the food was as advertised.

review/summary: Nutritious and satisfying
review/text: This is dense tuna. I love it straight out of the can over salad greens, with a little olive oil, lemon juice, and capers. It is super high in omega-3s and just delicious. I have been eating this for years, and Amazon has a great deal on it. I am a student in a masters program (Physician Assistant) and always have cans of this in my locker for lunch in case I forget something. It has come in handy! It satisfies my hunger for hours because of all the protein and fat.<br /><br />The taste is really strong, but that is what I like. Regarding the metallic taste, I have only tasted a metallic taste once and that was the unsalted variety. I have probably eaten 200 cans of this over the years and have only tasted that once. So I don't think it's a common problem.<br /><br />I think this tuna is for someone who doesn't really want to have to add a bunch of stuff to it to make it palatable/taste good. It's a bit pricy, but well worth it for the convenience and nutritional value.<br /><br />One thing to be cautious of is that if you want to put a lot of stuff in it, this might be a bit too salty for that. I find this pretty salty, but you'd have to judge yourself. I buy both the unsalted and the salted. If I'm making a tuna salad or tuna melts, I use the unsalted and add in salt to taste. Otherwise, I find it's too salty. Straight out of the can, though, the salted is the best way to go.  :)

review/summary: Less Tuna per can,  but a much better buy now!
review/text: I was a very long-time loyal buyer of Wild Planet of Minimal Mercury Wild Troll-Caught Albacore Tuna until Wild Planet decided to eliminate the minimal mercury tuna and simultaneously cut the size of their can from 6oz to 5oz.<br /><br />The surprising and very good news is that they also cut the price from $27 to $16. So the price actually went down from $4.50 per can to $2.67 per can. That brought the price per oz down from $0.77/oz to $0.55/oz. ---- a very substantial (almost 40%) savings! The quality is still very good, and it's actually a much better buy now.<br /><br />On the minus side, I do not like the fact that Wild Planet decided to ditch the Minimal Mercury Albacore and instead is pushing it's Minimal Mercury Skip-jack tuna instead.<br /><br />Additionally, I am not thrilled that this product is now coming from Vietnam---according to the product description. I prefer my troll caught albacore tuna to come from clean waters of Alaska or Oregon.<br /><br />But in light of today's economy, getting such excellent tuna for almost 40% less --- only $0.55/oz when a closely equivalent version previously cost $0.77/oz is a remarkable and welcome change.<br /><br />UPDATE!  This product is going for $29.95 + shipping on the Wild Planet website.  So the Amazon price of $16 is a super bargain and probably won't last.  I am going to stock up while I still can!!!

review/summary: Excellent Tuna at a Decent Price
review/text: Research other tuna products, their sourcing, processing, and then research Wild Planet.  In addition to their quility processing, their selection of smaller fish, and the fact that the tuna is cooked in the can is quite different from say, Bumble Bee.  Most others freeze the fish first, then bake it, which removes a lot of the desirable Omega 3 oils.  This is sushi grade tuna, hand packed while raw.<br /><br />Plus, the taste just blows all the others away.  I've been using this product for quite some time, and have never had an experience such as the 1 star reviewer has.  I would have to imagine, had that person requested a replacement or refund Amazon would have made it right.<br /><br />I don't often buy the best product out there nor shop organic, but with tuna it is important to me to consume the best product I can obtain.

Silly me to think that a product labelled "Tuna in water" actually consists of simply tuna in water.  I ordered this brand expecting to have to give up something in taste or texture in exchange for the health benefits and environmental benefits. At minimum, I expected not to notice or care much about the taste.  I could not have been more wrong.  This is without question the most delicious tuna I have ever eaten and the difference is definitely noticeable.  This is worth every penny.  How often can you do well for your body and the planet AND treat yourself as well.

Fresh is clearly always better but not always feasible due to geographic location and/or cost and Wild Planet makes a great alternative here. Great tasting tuna, low mercury, bpa free, but still packed with protein & omega 3s and all the other benefits of eating seafood. In addition, it is simply convenient to keep around for those last minute meals when you simply have nothing ready. Product highly recommended for not only great tasting and healthy tuna but also focus on sustainable and ethical operations.

review/text: I keep reading about how we're supposed to have more fish in our diet. Well, okay, I can go along with that and I've been adding a few extra meals per week. Fish is hard for me to keep, so the kind I rely most on is canned fish and, to a lesser degree, frozen fish. As such, I was shopping at my local Costco store and came up with a pack of six cans (5 ounces each) of "Wild Planet" Wild Albacore Tuna. I just had some for lunch with wild and brown rice, baby carrots and celery. The cats went wild over the smell (a good sign).Very good tuna. Excellent taste! Well above most of the other brands of tuna that I've had. I'll be looking forward to trying it out in several casseroles that I make up. It's good to have stuff like this on the pantry shelves. It's so easy to make up something tasty and healthy too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I have mild cerebral palsy, and, being so solid, I find it a bit difficult to break up (for tuna salad) with just a fork. Does anyone have any ideas for me? I thought of something like a potato masher. Might that work? Links to any specific products that I can buy here on Amazon would be appreciated.

review/text: In general, it aggravates me when people leave packaging and performance feedback as product feedback, so apologies, but this is a SAFETY issue. This is canned food! I have ordered this several times from Amazon, and EVERY time cans have arrived dented. If Amazon doesn't get how unsafe this is and start packaging appropriately, it should get out of the food business. I will not order again. I do highly recommend the product, which is the best tasting tuna ever and is produced by a US company in a sustainable way.

I bought the 5oz one, and gosh, the Tuna filled me right up after work out. Also there is no salt added so it's super healthy as well. Can opener is NOT needed! Lastly, some people have been concerning about "processed in Vietnam". It is actually American Tuna but canned in Vietnam if you look through their website. So it's safe!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EY5TTW">Wild Planet Sustainably Caught Wild Albacore Tuna, 5 Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a><br />I Bought this for my Mother as a Birthday Gift as the other Tuna suppler has gone out of business. When I called her about it all she could do is say it's the BEST tasting TUNA she has had since the other place was in business. She is very picky in what she eats. And has been looking for a good source of tune for the past year and a 1/2 or so. Now that she has found this tuna I've have her on the auto shipment of 6 cans every 3 months and I may need to change that to more often. I buy this tuna because at age 96 if Mom likes it and will eat it and it's good for her I have no problems at all getting it for her. And my understanding is the the tuna is only canned in Vietnam, the tuna is Wild caught & all natural. Sustainably caught by fishermen out of various ports along the Pacific Coast. Why it's canned in Vietnam is anybody's guess. I would highly recommend this Tuna for it's teats & Quality.

There was hardly any candied fruit in the cookies, and tasted mostly of the nuts that were sprinkled on top.  But since the cookies had melded into one giant blob, you had to just pull a piece off.

I am especially thankful that it was prepared with nothing that could cause digestive upsets with sensitive stomachs.  It is a product of Israel, and it can be difficult to find in American grocery stores year-round.  The ingredients are simple:  sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, emulsifier (PGPR), artificial flavor (vanillin), salt, chocolate contains cocoa solids 40% min.  It is lecithin free, but it may contain traces of nuts/peanuts.

review/summary: Excellent Full-Flavored Coffee!
review/text: I guess I'm a bit of a coffee snob. I always groan when friends suggest we go to Dunkin' Donuts for joe. Even their dark roast is nearly flavorless. So when I saw some of the glowing reviews for the Community coffees I was of course skeptical. I am currently spending about $10/lb. for AMAZING coffee from a local roaster. I have to buy 12 pounds at a time to get that price! So I've been looking for ways to cut my coffee budget without settling for flavorless coffee. When I saw Amazon's 30% off promo I took a chance. And boy am I glad I did!<br /><br />This is a very full-flavored coffee. I wouldn't say it had a complexity of flavors like my favorite African origin blends I get from my local roaster, but it is flavorful and satisfying. I just purchased 10 pounds of the Community Coffee Dark Roast, so I can't wait to try it next!<br /><br />One tip for longer term coffee storage: I double bag my coffee in freezer quality Hefty OneZip bags. I use the jumbo size 2-1/2 gal bags and arrange the coffee bags inside the OneZip bags so they fill up the space as much as possible. Then I put a second OneZip bag over the first but I flip the outer bag so the closure is on the OPPOSITE end from the closure of the inner bag. All these steps keep as much freezer air out of the coffee as possible. I have been keeping my coffee like that for up to 3 months and I have found no difference in taste from the first bag to the last. You can always use 1 gal freezer bags too if you store less coffee. Just make sure you use the same double bag setup.<br /><br />I take one pound out of the freezer at a time for making coffee, and store it in the refrigerator in a freezer bag between uses. Another little trick I have found is to cut an inch off the top of the bag with scissors as you use the coffee up. Then I fold it neatly and tightly down to the remaining coffee in the bag and clip it with a medium sized binder clip. I find I spill less coffee this way because my coffee scoop is short and doesn't reach down into the bag very well as it get's lower and lower.<br /><br />I know...I'm a total coffee-geek!

review/summary: A Louisiana Perspective
review/text: While I'm the first to admit that I am biased when it comes to anything from Louisiana, it's hard to find a coffee better for the price or the flavor than Community Coffee's Cafe Special.  I believe that coffee is best tested while drinking it black, since there's no way for sugar, cream, or anything else to change the flavor of the coffee.  That's how I'm reviewing this coffee.<br /><br />Cafe Special is a medium-dark roast that serves up a not-too-bitter taste.  It's perfect for early mornings, particularly while part of a sweet breakfast of pancakes and syrup, doughnuts, or beignets (if you can get your hands on some good Louisiana ones).  For later in the morning or early afternoon, it's a very good pick-me-up.  It has a deep and rich flavor that's sure to please even the snobbiest of coffee drinkers.<br /><br />I'm fortunate enough to have met people from all over the United States of all ages, races, and creeds.  While many of them have a favorite regional coffee (or chain coffee such as Starbucks), they always ask me if I have any Community Coffee on hand when I see them.  My parents, both of which are retired, travel the country in their camper and have run into the same thing.  No matter where you go, if you run into someone who has tasted Community Coffee, they are always thirsty for more.  To me, that stands taller than any review for the quality and flavor of Community Coffee.<br /><br />Try some today!

review/text: I drank community Coffee growing up as did most folks that I knew. Since moving from Louisiana years ago, I grind my own coffee beans since no ground coffee that I've tried compares. However, a brother sent me a bag of Community Cafe Special recently and it is almost as good as fresh ground bean coffee. In fact, it's so good that I am here at Amazon as I write this to purchase more. Bar-none, there are no other pre-ground coffees that come close to Community Coffee.

review/summary: Excellent flavor - lovely brew
review/text: We have tried many brands of coffee this year and found most to be rather disappointing. Not so with the Community brand coffees we've tried so far. We've like them all and have enjoyed the Cafe Special the most. We're going to stick with this one.<br />The Cafe Special is a clean, medium roast with almost undetectable acidity.<br />For the best tasting brew, start the brewing process just long enough to dampen the grounds and then let them sit and bloom for a minute before restarting the brewing process. You'll have brewed a grand pot of delicious, aromatic coffee.<br /><br />I have 2 bags at a time delivered - Keep one at home and I transfer the contents of the other bag to a container that seals tightly and take it to work with me so I can make coffee just for myself. - The rest of our work crew either doesn't drink coffee or are content with the awful, vile smelling and tasting (in my opinion)generic, canned coffee our company supplies each branch office. I keep my very own 4 cup coffee pot in my personal office and brew my excellent Community coffee there. - Usually 2 pots a day. Sometimes I even share a cup or two or three with coworkers when we're all stuck working late. How nice of me!! :)<br />Everyone comments how the coffee in my office always tastes so good. Can't figure how they can go back to drinking the icky, free stuff.<br /><br />The price is right for this coffee too and having it delivered via auto ship makes it even better.

review/summary: Decent coffee for the price
review/text: Granted, this coffee is not Starbucks.  Then again, if that's what you're expecting then you won't be happy.  However, this coffee is a great everyday coffee that tastes better than your standard Folgers or Maxwell House but provides a better value.  For the amount of coffee you get (64 oz), it's a better deal than anything I can buy at Sams Club.  The grind is a little more coarse than other ground drip coffees (like Folgers or Maxwell House), and could probably work in a french press if you don't mind a little extra sediment in your coffee.  I was pleasantly surprised at the mellow taste that wasn't weak and have been enjoying this coffee for about a week straight.  I would definitely recommend this coffee to anyone who isn't expecting their coffee to taste like a kick in the face--which by the way, I do love Starbucks in addition to more mellow brews.

review/summary: Mmm...cafe special, the best coffee on the market
review/text: Community roasts the best coffe.  Everyone in Louisiana can tell you this.  It's too bad that most people out of the gulf south are not aware of how awesome CC's is.  Smooth, medium to dark body, and full of aroma, but not acidic and burt like that starbucks garbage.<br /><br />I highly recommend for those who want to have coffee with taste.

review/text: Community's Cafe Special has become my favorite stand-by coffee - not too dark or bold, not too mild. Since leaving the South, I can't find it in the grocery stores, so I'm thrilled by its availability on Amazon. Plus, you'd never get a deal this great in the stores anyway: four pounds of great coffee, free shipping, dropped right at your door. Life is good.

review/summary: Cafe Special... AWESOME COFFEE
review/text: I am a huge fan of Community Coffee.  The company often runs specials, they are very responsive to their customers and their product is good.<br /><br />I've tried most of their flavors now and this one is a very good one.  I buy this any time i find it on sale.<br /><br />I've written the company asking for samplers and they sent all kinds.  It was great.  I also love their decaf and 1/2 caf products too.<br /><br />They will email you when there are large storms (like the hurricanes) to let you know there may be a delay in shipping.  Makes sense.<br /><br />I believe all the beans are roasted here in the US.<br /><br />Huge fan of Community Coffee.<br /><br />But, I also realize that not everyone will agree.  What i like, you may not and vice versa.<br /><br />My recommendation... buy 1 bag (it's now sold in local stores where i live) and if you like it, then come back to Amazon for more as the prices here are often the best, unless the company is running a special.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: Have been buying Between Roast in 1LB packages, 10 at a time from CC.  This figures out to be cheaper per oz and the taste is just as good as the  Between Road.  Use it in my Keurig using refillable cup (Ekobrew)  Get Great coffee one cup at a time.  Can't wait until Community Club offers their coffee in K-Cups because I'm lazy.

review/text: I ordered 4 bags of this coffee when it was on special..I noticed upon my first cup that it has a very distinct taste..the verdict is still out since I am only on about cup number 10...at first I thought no way am I gonna consume this stuff...but after a few cups now,its not too bad...hehe...I just made a cup and noticed the smell/taste when it was brewing,don't know if its a manure smell or what..maybe someone else is better at identifying smells..(I am not)..but I can smell very good....take a chance you may like it,and who knows after 4 bags I may be HOOKED?
