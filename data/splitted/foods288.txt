review/summary: Confusing advertising
review/text: Purchased this for my daughter. the picture of the item certainly looked to us to include all five pez dispenser animals. She was only interested in one so I figured it was worth the price for all of them to get her the one. I guess I should have been on the lookout for "fine print." Sad, that is not usually how Amazon does business. We got our ONE dispenser and it was not the one she wanted. Should have shopped on E-bay first.

review/summary: Tasty but overcooked!
review/text: I like to make a quick salad using these tiny canned shrimps but the cans of shrimp I got were overcooked and tough.  I have bought this product many times before at my local grocery store but this was the first time that the shrimps were actually tough and hard like they had been cooked for too long.  Normally I would recommend these tiny canned shrimps but if Crown Prince has changed it's preparation for some reason......I can not say that I would recommend these any longer.

review/summary: THE HIT OF THE LADIES GET TOGETHER
review/text: This Fruit Dip Peach Passion Mix is Awsome!!! It was the hit of the get together I had with my friends a few afternoons ago. Just mix with Sour Cream, or Sour Cream and Cream Cheese and serve with fruits in season. I used Strawberries, Peach and Nectarine Slices and Rasberries. Make certain that you mix it up and let it sit in the refrigerator at least an hour prior to serving so the flavors can mingle. It is that simple. Then you too can be the hostess of the hour!!!WOW. Am I glad I found this!!!<br /><br />I put it together very quickly...it only took 5 or 10 minutes to find a fancy bowl and serving plate. Then, I mixed up the dip using half Sour Cream and half whipped cream cheese. It only took one cup of each. I made it up the night before because I wanted to be absolutely certain the flavors mingled and mixed as much as possible. I stored it overnight in Tupperware, then the next day popped the dip into a beautiful cut glass dish. I put that in the middle of a large decorative, serving plate and surrounded the cut glass dish with fruit. Every single person commented on how good this was.<br /><br />It is quick, not expensive, and looks really pretty. If you are the artistic type, I imagine you could decorate or garnish this dip (the photo on the package shows it decorated with mint leaves) and make it look really smashing.<br /><br />I have already ordered more and plan to keep this flavor, or some flavor appropriate to the season, on hand at all time. It has become an instant staple in my pantry. Give it a try and I think that you too, will become an instant "star hostess", and will keep it on your pantry shelves. This was an absolute blessing of a find. Hope you enjoy it nearly as much as I and my friends have!!!!!

review/summary: Great buy on Licorice herbal tea
review/text: Another product the puget consumer's co-op no longer carries. I am very glad to find it here for a very good price. This herbal tea is very good quality and is packaged to stay fresh, more so than it was in the bulk bins in the store.<br /><br />I use it in my version of chai or Yogi tea: with Fennel, ginger, cinnamon stick, whole cloves, fenugreek, cardamom seeds, cloves<br /><br />good drink for congestion, gas, asthma, or just tastes good. The licorice makes it sweet and is somewhat stimulating when you have a cold or congestion, but can also raise blood pressure if you use too much, so watch out if that is a problem for you

review/summary: Good cut, and very fresh
review/text: I bought this for my husband, who previously had to ship it from Holland until we found this brand. Other US brands were large chunks of root, or was blended with tea. This is just the actual cut and chopped root, pure and fresh. We scoop it up in a tea ball and steep, and it makes a great tea. This is also by far the best price that we've found on it. The downside is that we have to buy two pounds. That is a LOT of tea. However, the bags are foil wrapped and sealed, so the second bag will stay fresh until we are ready for it.

I am so excited to have descovered this stuff here on Amazon.com for two reasons.  #1- because it is CHEAP!  Way cheaper than in the store.  #2- because it ROCKS!  It tastes awesome!  I'd eat this even if I wasn't bodybuilding.  It is a yummy, quick snack.  All you need is a fork or spoon and you are set.  I eat this directly out of the pouch.  Excellent!

review/summary: Tasty, but not so Mediterranean
review/text: These pouches of "Mediterranean Style" Chuck Salmon are handy to have around the house for a quick snack with no prep time,or to take along for meals on the go. I like to keep things like this, or cans of kippered herring, along with rice cakes or WASA bread in my glove box because I do not eat fast food. The taste is good, with a bit of spiciness. I was a little disappointed that there were no Italian herbs like oregano or basil. Once I get my garden in, I'll just bring some along with me. But really, it would have helped the flavor and nutrician quite a bit if they had included some herbs. Also, the soybean oil taste is not great; olive oil would have been much better. My other suggestion would be less water. The net weight is 3.5 ounces, but because of the water content, there isn't as much actual salmon as I had anticipated. An OK product, though.

review/text: I've edited this review -- used to be five stars, now it's three.  Native Forest Organic was top-quality stuff last year.  It was as good as Natural Value Organic (you can see my review here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTKRLU">Natural Value Organic Coconut Milk Lite, 14 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>), which is now more expensive than this Native Forest.  However, I just got two cases and it is no longer half liquid, half solid as it should be.  Now, it is thin, almost homogenized, along the lines of something like "light" coconut milk.  It is still fresh and good-tasting, but just does not go as far.

review/summary: All cans intact
review/text: After reading other reviews I was concerned about ordering this, expecting that the cans may arrive damaged, however they were all in perfect condition. The cans were all packed tightly in a box, which was then placed within a second box for delivery. As for the product itself, I had been using a coconut milk from a carton that was smooth and did not separate. This coconut milk separates into the coconut water and coconut cream, so when the can is opened, the harder coconut cream is on top and the water is underneath. Since I only use 1 serving at a time (1/4 cup) this means dividing the cream and coconut water separately. I tried blending it in a blender but it still did not blend together. The taste is comparable to other coconut milks I have tried.

review/summary: Awful.  Truly.
review/text: This product was horrible.  The very first can I opened was dented, so I checked the other cans in the case, and - with the exception of one can - they were all in the same shape.  I figured I could overlook that, but the can I was holding felt heavy, which was weird, so I opened it.  Totally solid, except for a small amount of coconut water (not milk!) at the bottom - which I only discovered after I scooped out the rest of the product.  Since I use this product to make Green Smoothie Girl's Hot Pink Breakfast Smoothie, I figured I could still use the solid mass (I blend in a BlendTec, which can handle it).  WRONG.  It made our smoothies totally grainy and flat out horrible.  We've been drinking these smoothies for about 6 months now, and really truly like them, but a smoothie made with this product?  Gross.  Totally different.  We gave it a shot, though, and continued using the product for about 2 weeks.  We use 1 can every morning in our smoothies, and each and every smoothie was exactly the same texture: grainy and almost mottled with this coconut milk.  Yuck.  Since I had signed up for Amazon's Subscribe & Save program, I knew I had to cancel my order (2 cases every month) soon, but Amazon was really on top of things and I received my next order over a week early!  Now I had 3 cases of product I didn't want.  Stellar.  Luckily, after an email to Amazon over the fact that I can't return this product because it's a grocery item, they refunded my account and all is well again - plus, I remembered to cancel my subscription to this item, so I'm in no danger of ending up with another two cases!

The Amazon packaging was fine and it was in a larger box with other items which were not damaged, so it was packaged like that at the manufacturer. I was hoping the bad reviews from last year were fixed but I guess not. These cans were from Thailand (not Sri Lanka) so atleast they fixed that issue. I'm most likely going to find a different brand after this!<br /><br />Amazon of course is amazing and they already have a replacement shipment on the way. Hopefully they checked it before it left and I don't get anymore dented cans!

review/summary: Organic BPA Free Goodness! (I got Thailand sourced, noticing negative reviews from Sri Lanka cans as per other reviews)
review/text: After reading the review about dented cans, I was leery to buy 2 cases from Amazon but I am glad I did! I received all 24 cans, and NONE were dented. I was pleasantly surprised! The milk worked for my thai curry quite well, but I just wish it was a bit thicker. While this milk is not as thick as the Mae Ploy brand I have tried in the past, I feel better knowing it was organically grown and that this particular company does not use BPA in their cans for coconut milk, or several other of their products. If more companies jump on the bandwagon I will try more brands but until then I am sticking with Native Forest.<br /><br />Added Aug 15th 2011:<br />I now see lots of negative reviews on this product due to sourcing from both Sri Lanka and Thailand. Reviewers have stated the poor quality watery ones are coming from Sri Lanka, which makes sense why I rated mine a 4 and liked mine, because mine were the Thailand kind that like other reviewers have stated, taste great. So be careful when ordering this product and make sure you get the Thailand kind! (will say this on the back of the label) As there is no way to know which Amazon is shipping out, it seems the best bet is to get them in a local store and check the back and get the good sourcing of coconut milk that will say Thailand.<br /><br />Added Oct 20th, 2012:<br />As commenters have posted as a response to my review, you are able to purchase a powder that you can mix with hot water if you wish to avoid cans and BPA at Wilderness Family Naturals website.<br /><br />Another option is the Tropical Traditions website shows how to make coconut milk with dried coconut at home. (They sell organic dried coconut on their website, so avoiding cans, less packaging, ethical sourcing) They sell quality coconut products, I have purchased many of their items.<br /><br />Lastly, I read recently on someone's blog that you can use the coconut cream concentrate found on the Tropical Traditions website to make coconut milk, that it is very cost effective. I have not ever tried this, however I add a bit to smoothies for my partner in the summer and he loves the taste. If I ever try these things out I will report back, however I just wanted to give ideas to folks who might see this if they do not want to go the canned milk route. :)

review/summary: Bait & Switch fraud!
review/text: Where I come from "bait & switch" is called fraud.<br />I thought that surely by now Amazon.com would have corrected this "bait & switch" problem of offering a premium coconut milk from Thailand, but then sending an inferior "oil & water'" product from Skri Lanka, since there were lots of reviews warning about this.<br />I had carefully verified that what I was ordering was truly from Thailand-but it is NOT! It is from Skri Lanka, instead.<br />ALSO, the product I received from Skri Lanka was in the old style yellow lined (Phenol lined?) cans-the yellow kind with the white stripe down the side that theoretically products you from the metals they use to seal the can! (And I am allergic to the chemical phenol!)<br />The Thailand product comes in a silver colored can-I opened both products today and did the comparision side by side.<br />So not only is Amazon.com allowing a bait & switch to happen, they are allowing an older style (a potentially harmful style) of can to be sold.<br />I had to use a couple of cans for a party tonight, but I will not eat it!<br />I have asked for my money back and cancelled by subscription, and will buy the rich creamy Thailand coconut milk from my health food store!

review/summary: Supply Shortage so Product Coming From Sri Lanka not Thailand
review/text: I love their product from Thailand.  I don't like the product from Sri Lanka.<br />The content of coconut oil is higher in Sri Lanka made coco milk, throwing off the consistency.<br />I don't want to have to warm the coconut oil prior to using in a cold smoothie,<br />it will just chunk up anyway.  Wrote the manufacturer - here's the reply<br /><br />From the manufacturer:<br />Thank you for writing. Due to worldwide surging demand for coconut<br />milk during its lean harvest season, our primary organic packer in<br />Thailand is unable to keep up with our volume of sales. Therefore we<br />have added a trusted organic coconut facility in Sri Lanka as our<br />secondary supplier. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka uses a slightly different<br />processing method than Thailand does and the Sri Lankan product has<br />more tendency to separate when its temperature falls below 80 degrees<br />F. This makes the milk appear curdled as the coconut fat separates<br />from the liquid. Such separation is harmless and easily remedied by<br />placing the can of coconut milk in hot water for 15 minutes and then<br />stirring the contents thoroughly. We regret this inconvenience,<br />especially since consumers have come to really value the smoother,<br />creamier consistency of our Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk. While<br />all natural and organic coconut milk will separate in cool<br />temperatures, the Thailand milk is more smooth and homogeneous. Faced<br />with lengthy stock shortages during an exceptionally lean coconut<br />season, we decided to accept the different coconut milk consistencies<br />from two supply lines rather than have no organic coconut milk at all<br />during this six month lean period. We are only shipping Thai sourced<br />coconut milk<br />as of right now, but distributors and stores may still have Sri Lankan<br />sourced product.<br /><br />Thank you for your patience and your understanding.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Joanna Freet<br />Edward & Sons Trading Co., Inc.

review/summary: Sri Lanka - UPDATED
review/text: After my initial disappointment, I contacted Native Forest and asked them about the Sri Lanka sourcing of coconut milk. They informed me that they had already discontinued their sourcing (this was around September 2011), and that the only remaining cans were those already stocked. It now being February 2012, I decided to give them another shot. I'm SO glad that I did, too, because theirs is easily the best coconut milk I've ever had--now that it's properly sourced from Thailand, that is. Those of you who were concerned about getting any from Sri Lanka should be safe now. Additionally, it seems that while they once weren't accepting returns for this item, you can get a replacement if the cans are dented and you call Amazon. And if they're from Sri Lanka, you can be sure they're going to be dented!<br /><br />Old (1 star) review:<br />Another warning for anyone who orders this: if you get the cans from Sri Lanka, they WILL be watery, and they WILL be dented, and they're NOT eligible for a return.<br />You have been warned.

review/summary: Best Tasting - NO DENTS!
review/text: I have used the Native Forest coconut milk for years. I have tried many others and this one is by far the best tasting, plus it is organic. I go through enough of it that I signed up for a recurring delivery of a case. It is going to save me quite a bit over purchasing locally at my grocery store. I read the reviews talking about dented cans but ordered anyway. Some that I buy at the grocery store are dented so I didn't feel it was a big deal either way. I received my case today and not a single can was dented.<br /><br />Regarding the reviewer talking about the expiration date - please disregard. They do not understand the coding system that is used. As explained in my reply to that comment, the date code is a production code and is six letters. Those that I received today were BAAJCH which corresponded to a production date of September 10, 2009. This is only 5 months ago.<br /><br />Also the same reviewer talking about solids in the can may not realize that when coconut milk is colder (below 76 degrees), the oil will solidify. If you want it all liquid and smooth put the can in a pan of warm water for a while.<br /><br />This is an excellent product, even better with Amazon's special pricing and free shipping for recurring orders. This is also backed by Amazon's excellent customer service noted by the unhappy customer.

review/summary: Dented Cans & AVOID The Product of SRI LANKA cans
review/text: At least half of my cans came dented.  And they were packed that way, not dented in transit.  **** Also, be sure to call the company to ask if they are Product of Thailand or Product of Sri Lanka.  (It is printed on the back of the cans.) They have a different supplier in Sri Lanka which waters down the milk -- the cans sound like water when you shake them, not like thick creamy coconut milk (as in the Thailand cans).  And it is NOT that the flesh settles to the bottom -- it is watery all the way through.  Completely different product and the watered down cans just don't produce as nice a product in the kitchen :(.  Beware.

review/summary: Cancelled my monthly order after trying it.
review/text: We are a dairy free family who use coconut milk as a substitute, so I am pretty familiar with coconut milk.  I had purchased several cans of Native Forest from a retail store and liked it - I use it in my coffee as a creamer.  However, the stuff that was delivered to me through Amazon was completely different that the cans I bought at the store.  The milk is very thin (which I don't mind) and incredibly oily.  I shook the cans thoroughly before I opened them, but you can see the oily floating at the top.  The milk separates when in the fridge with the coconut oil forming a thick layer on top.  There is an odd flavor to the milk, too.  I am so bummed I have to go through 12 cans of this before I can order some Thai Kitchen.

review/summary: so disappoointing
review/text: So, after reading every review, I checked to see that the country of origin listed in the description was Thailand. I tried not one but a replacement case as well, both a horribly greasy product from Sri Lanka. Amazon immediately reimbursed me. I had used this product before (not from Amazon) and my cans must have been from Thailand as the product is (was)so dreamy I really wanted it again.<br /><br />I decided to call the company because their description on Amazon is false advertising. The woman I spoke to was an absolute brat, borderline rude, with excuse after excuse. Maybe she was tired of fielding complaints, but isnt' that her job? I was so surprised because I have had such great conversations and learned so much from other small companies like that--like Nutiva (who I complained to about my leaking coconut oil and devleoped a great relationship with one of the representatives there who sent me a replacement even though I told him Amazon had already reembursed me. I just wanted to let them know about the problem.<br /><br />Her biggest excuse (among several side-stepping maneuvers) is that the sample sent to them did not match the product. To me this speaks VOLUMES about the lack of quality control at the company. Makes me wonder what is in those cans. So, Amazon and other poor consumers will have to suffer for Edward and Sons faulty business products until the Sri Lankan is used up 'in about another month or so'. Seriously?<br /><br />A small company with poor customer service is doomed to fail, no matter how great their product. And with a lousy product like this I am unwilling to try any of their other things if they don't stand behind their products.

review/text: I've been purchasing this product for a year now. It used to be very creamy and thick, it was great. The last few shipments it has been watered down to the point where it's not enjoyable and the cans are dented to the point where they are difficult to open. I no longer use it in my coffee which is a shame, and I can't make coconut ice cream which used to be amazing. I'm looking for an alternative as I have no other choice but to cancel my subscribe and save. I'm thinking about replacing it with coconut cream as it is difficult to find BPA Free canned coconut milk.

review/summary: Quality Unacceptable... used to be better
review/text: We use a lot of coconut milk in our house. In addition to cooking with it, we use it in our coffee every morning. I've purchased this brand before (Native Forest Organic Classic) and the coconut milk was rich and creamy. The BPA-free can was also a strong selling point for me. However, I am VERY disappointed with this last shipment I received. There is a pronounced reduction in quality... watery milk with large gritty chunks of fat. No creaminess at all. I see from the other recent comments that other customers have experienced the same disappointment.<br /><br />The lower price and BPA-free cans become less attractive when you are receiving a sub-standard product... especially a case of it. I'd rather pay more for the other brand I purchase, Natural Value Organic Coconut Milk, and get a higher quality product.

I was impressed as this is how it should be. 2 shipments had poor quality. Very thin watery cans of product.  I even put the product in the refrigerator and it didn't thicken one little bit. That is unacceptable.  I have been debating on allowing another shipment to come with the hopes of getting a good batch or cancel my subscribe and save order for this product. I have decided to cancel and make my own coconut milk.

review/summary: Beware the Doppelganger UPDATED REVIEW
review/text: I was ordering Native Forest Coconut Milk from Amazon quite frequently. It was the most delectable coconut milk I could find anywhere. The five star reviews were spot on. Loved it!<br /><br />Then all the sudden I started receiving a completely different product in a can with the same label. It seemed like very, VERY watered down coconut milk with coconut oil added to it. The result was a liquid with oil solids (translucent like coconut oil) throughout. It didn't matter how much I shook the can (or heated the unopened can in hot water before shaking) it was a disgusting, unusable, oily slop! If I refrigerated an open can the oil would rise to the top and form a solid top layer. I've never seen any other brand of coconut milk do this.<br /><br />The cans do say "Product of SRI LANKA" in spite of the Amazon listing stating it is from Thailand. I suspect this it the reason for the poor quality. I would bet that the cans that have labels stating it was from Thailand are the real Native Forest Coconut Milk and the Sri Lanka cans are some sort of evil Doppelg&auml;nger!<br /><br />UPDATE 3/15/2012<br />Due to new reviews I decided to give the product a try once again. Looks like Amazon or Native Forest has addressed the issue of the inferior product from Sri Lanka. I have recieved several 12 packs and all have been from Thailand, all have been super creamy and delicious. Thank goodness. I love this product.<br /><br />Also wanted to thank Amazon who always refunded my money when I complained about the Sri Lankan slop.

review/summary: Thin product from Sri Lanka
review/text: After reading reviews from 8-12+ months prior to my purchase complaining about how inferior the milk from Sri Lanka was, I felt confident that Amazon would stop stocking that product and ordered a case. It was from Sri Lanka. It is a thin product that becomes greasy when heated. It lacks the thick rich taste I'm used to from Native Forest. Very disappointed. I only gave it a 2 star because of the BPA free can. I'd like to rate Amazon a zero for not listening to us complain.

review/summary: Updated: Sourced from Thailand
review/text: Update: This coconut milk is shipping out from Thailand again and you can definitely tell the difference. We have been ordering this brand again for the last few months and have not received any of the low quality Sri Lanka product. I definitely recommend this coconut milk as long as it continues to come from Thailand.<br /><br />Original Review:  The first time we ordered this Coconut Milk it was delicious and thick as expected. We went through it quickly and ordered a second case. I was just about ready to set this up for subscribe and save, but after tasting the most recent batch I was glad I waited. As others have mentioned, they are currently sending out cans that were processed in Sri Lanka. I do not know if they are processing it differently or if the coconuts are just regionally different, but it is a big difference in flavor. Our coconut ice cream is coming out less creamy and more like blocks of ice and it requires a lot of extra peppermint extract to get the flavor right with the Sri Lanka Product. I will be ordering another brand until this is resolved.

review/summary: ok, could be better
review/text: the milk is pretty good, and it does say product of thailand on the can, but like other reviewers, i also received several dented cans. i know there's not really anything wrong with dented cans, and i have shopped at several discount grocery stores (aldi, UGO - united grocery outlet, bottom dollar, etc) so i've eaten plenty of canned goods from dented cans, but i was shopping at a grocery outlet, so i expected to see dented cans at a greatly reduced price. amazon is not a grocery outlet and i shouldn't have to pay "full price" for dented cans. i asked my boyfriend, "how should i feel about this?" and he said, "pissed." i'm not angry, but as i said, i expect quality assurance from amazon. also, this has nothing to do with the product, but how is amazon gonna offer the super saver shipping (for orders over $25) on this item, then price it at $23.76 (twenty-three dollars and seventy-six cents}? you have to either pay the shipping on a 12lb item or purchase another item in order to get the free shipping. that's pretty lame customer care, amazon. don't be so shady, we're not stupid.

review/text: We experienced the country shift that Native Forest went through last year. Since they are one of the few, if only, companies offering BPA-free coconut milk, we stuck with it, but the quality of the product is pretty poor now. It was actually BETTER when it would separate because it actually tasted like coconut milk. You just has to heat it in another container to get it to combine (come on - its an organic product - mother nature didn't produce things for long distance shipping in metal cans and THAT'S OK). Now that they've switched countries of origin, it stays more mixed, but it has NO COCONUT TASTE. It is just a can of guar gum. :(

review/summary: Be aware of the changes that have been made!!
review/text: I started buying this product in January and it was thick, creamy and delicious.  I needed a hand blender to mix the thick cream with the milk and enjoyed using it to make puddings, etc.  Then, in the Spring the product changed dramatically for the worse.  As previous reviewers stated, they started sourcing the milk from Sri Lanka instead of Thailand and the end product was thin, watery and had little clumps of fat that would not and could not be blended into the milk.  I called the customer service and they advised me to wait before buying more until the can once again said that it was a product of Thailand.  So, a few weeks ago, I was delighted to see that the cans at my local health food store once again stated that they were a "product of Thailand".  However, the product is still not the same product as it was before the change in sourcing.  While it is back to having a creamy like consistency, it is noticeably thinner.  Instead of needing a spoon, it pours right out of the can with the same consistency and thickness of light cream.  I can no longer use it to make puddings, etc because it is too thin.  It's as if someone watered down the product.  I called the company once again and they had absolutely no explanation for this change in thickness.  For a comparison, I also bought a can of the Thai Kitchen brand coconut milk (also sourced from Thailand) and it was exceptionally thick and creamy, about twice the thickness as the Native Forest.  So, until someone can give me a good explanation as to why the new coconut milk is so thin, I will switch to the Thai Kitchen brand.  What a shame, since this used to be a great product.

review/summary: great product but half of the cans were dented
review/text: This is a great product at a very good price. Delivery time was good, but a quarter of the cans had large dents in them, another quarter had small dents and only half of the cans (6) had no dents at all. So far, the dented cans I opened did not seem to suffer any quality loss, but I would feel a lot better if all the cans were dent-free. According to USDA Food Safety guidelines, there is always a danger that deep dents may have sharp points which allow bacteria to enter the can, and hence contaminating the food in the can.<br /><br />I would give a 5 star rating if all the cans were dent-free.

Secondly, admittedly, I was nervous about placing another order because of the reviews about the dented cans.  There isn't any excuse for dented cans especially when you have such a great product.  I would have been really disappointed and would have had to rethink reordering from this company.  Fortunately, they arrived in perfect condition and  will definitely keep restocking.

review/text: I have purchased other coconut milks (Natural Value Organic Coconut Milk, 14 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) from Amazon with good results, but that product is no longer available. So I bought this coconut milk hoping the other reviews were wrong. This coconut milk is terrible! Even after 24 hours in the refrigerator there was no separation in the can, and thus no coconut cream to be whipped and the coconut milk is very watery.  If you just want to throw this into the blender for shakes then it should be O.K., but if you are wanting creamy coconut milk, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Amazing coconut milk
review/text: My aunt is a doctor and nutritionist and a massive foodie. With disdain for the TK coconut milk she found in my cupboards, she suggested that I spring for the Native Forest coconut milk. I did and oh my goodness it is like an entirely different product. It tastes so, so, so, so much better than any of the under $2 a can brands I've been using in my curry for years.<br /><br />Since switching to this brand, I've started using much more coconut milk. I've substituted it for cow dairy in my smoothies and mashed potatoes which is far better for my health and tastes better, too!<br /><br />As for this delivery, I've only gotten one delivery, but it was super fast, well packaged, and from Thailand. It was separated, but still good and whether you stir it into mash, curry, or a shake, it gets re-emulsified.

review/summary: organic coconut milk
review/text: Being relatively new to the coconut milk scene, I started at my local grocery store with the only coconut milk I found there -- Thai Kitchen.  It was delicious--so rich and creamy.  I was hooked!  Imagine my surprise when I opened my first can of Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk.  It was thin and watery, not thick and creamy like the Thai Kitchen.<br /><br />I read the Amazon reviews and learned that coconut milk from Sri Lanka is thin and watery, while that which comes from Thailand is thick and creamy.  I checked the can.  Yup.  Sri Lanka.  The reviews are correct.<br /><br />The main reason I bought coconut milk from Amazon was that the price was a little cheaper buying it in bulk.  But I would rather have the better coconut milk and pay 25 to 30 cents more a can.  I probably won't buy coconut milk from Amazon anymore, since the customer is not able to select the country of origin for the product.

I will have a hard time trusting this brand again.<br /><br />UPDATE: Nov. 5, 2011. I forgot about a pending order. This time it was from Thailand with bubble wrap between the cans, no dents and much better quality.

review/summary: Quality waaaay down as of 6/11/11
review/text: I've been receiving this through Subscribe & save for nine months, and the quality of my last two cases has decreased....the change in the last batch was minor, but this batch is really sad.<br /><br />The original product was high-quality with a thick layer of coconut "cream" on top in temperatures over 74 degrees and a pudding-like consistency after mixing when stored in the refrigerator.  This last batch is watery from the can, liquid from the fridge, and oddly sweet for "unsweetened" coconut milk.<br /><br />I'm aware that the price for coconut oil and flesh has risen dramatically or late, and I can only guess that this decline in quality is Native Forest's attempt to continue providing organic coconut milk at a reasonable price.  There is no set ratio for how much coconut flesh is in a can of coconut milk, which is pureed coconut flesh blended with water.  Higher quality brands typically provide a higher ratio of flesh to water, low quality brands are sometimes made only with "coconut extract".  I can only hope that when coconut prices level out, this brand will return to its formerly excellent quality.

review/summary: quality has changed, oil separated, not creamy
review/text: Have had this brand a year or two ago and it was creamy, delicous, and good.  Then I ordered Rolands organic coconut milk for a great price on Amazon and really enjoyed it as well-- thick, creamy coconut flavor.  When it was time to reorder Rolands I found reviews stated that quality had changed, so I thought I'd return to a brand I trusted.  It seems the quality of many have changed recently, not sure why.<br /><br />In this specific batch, the milk was a bit more watery and oily.  I just use a portion of the can daily in smoothies, so when I refrigerate the remaining milk, the distinct oil separates and forms a hard layer on top.  Whereas, previous coconut milk would behave more like unhomogenized milk, and thick cream would collect on top (not a slab of "butter").

review/text: For several months now I have been ordering this by the case on subscribe and save.  Compared to other brands, I have noticed that some cans go bad really quickly once opened.  Also, I recently received a case in which at least several of the cans had coconut oil that had separated from the milk. I know that the white and clear parts of the milk often separate, but i have never opened a can of coconut milk and had a layer of oil on top.  Very disappointed.  Was hopeful because the cans are BPA free so I would like to stick with this company, but how can I justify the expense? We have just thrown away so many cans of it because we weren't sure it was good.

review/text: I purchased two cases of Native Forest Coconut milk and received the Sir Lanka-sourced product.<br /><br />It is thin, with hardly any fat. It's not suitable for cooking with, since it is too watery and does not have the richness of other brands of coconut milk. Thai Kitchen's coconut milk is much thicker and flavorful.<br /><br />The only upside is that I can use it undiluted in a shake, where I normally use 1:2 coconut milk and water. That's how thin it is, straight out of the can.

review/text: This arrived in perfect condition---not one can dented in three cases ordered. The milk has nice, thick cream on top that naturally separates from the liquid milk. Yes, the cream solidifies in cooler weather, which can be an advantage. For example, you can purposely refrigerate the can, then scoop out the thick, cold cream, add sweetener and use like whipped cream. It's delicious. The cream is also great in coffee as creamer. If you want it mixed (homogenized), just warm up the unopened can in hot water a bit and shake to mix. We use this canned milk in smoothies every day and love it.

review/text: I have mixed feelings about this product.  We have ordered it three times now through subscribe and save.  With the first order, we were 100% satisfied.  The coconut milk had a beautiful taste and texture.  With the second box, the quality of the product was just gross.  Coconut "milk" is absolutely the wrong word.  At least 80% of the can was solidified.  When I shook the can, I could hear no movement of liquid whatsoever.  I already had a few cans of coconut cream in the cupboard and didn't need a dozen more!  I continued to use it since the flavor was fine and I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it.  With our third order (what can I say, I'm an optimist!), there were still some solids but much less than our second order.<br /><br />It does not seem to matter whether the box states it originated in Thailand.  All three of our orders said they were from Thailand, yet they were of drastically different quality.

review/summary: If there were 20 'stars',  THAT WOULD BE MY RATING'!!  This Coconut Milk is the BEST in every way!!
review/text: I cannot use dairy and have been using coconut 'everything' for a long time.  By FAR the BEST coconut milk EVER, is this: Native Forest Organic CLASSIC Coconut Milk!!  But, it HAS TO BE THE ONE FROM THAILAND!!!  I had one BAD experience, and I found it to be BECAUSE it had come from Sri Lanka.  During the Summer months, you can shake the can before opening, (although I still use a can opener and pour it in a covered Pyrex bowl to refrigerate), you can actually pour it right out of the can. However, during the WINTER months, the coconut will be solidified, and the water with the guar gum, will STAY LIQUID, therefore, SEPARATED. Once I carefully pour it in the Pyrex bowl, I use a fork to 'mix' the milk to what is 'well enough' for what I use it for. If I would intend to drink it, I would use a hand mixer, on low to avoid splattering... not that I have tried it yet, but I assume it would work. Anyone who is interested in the EXCELLENT benefits of coconut oil, ought to always go for the CLASSIC.  There's nothing better than this brand for 'the CLASSIC ORGANIC COCONUT MILK'.  I HOPE I will NEVER have to do WITHOUT the 'NATIVE FOREST' brand!!!!

We've been using Trader Joe's coconut milk for some time because it is readily available and also without sulfites.  But there is no comparison on the taste.  Native Forest is tremendously tastier.  I'm switching for good.  Based on the fat content, it is cheaper than TJ's by about a third as well.  TJ's is really watered down in comparison.  And Amazon's free shipping keeps the cost low.

This is by far the best-tasting and best-consistency coconut milk I've tried.  I've used Roland, Thai Kitchen, Chaokoh, Golden Star, Goya... While the Golden Star and Thai Kitchen are good (Golden Star doesn't even have guar gum!), Native Forest has the thickest, creamiest layer of solids I have found, which is perfect for making whipped coconut cream for my coffee/dessert toppings, and the added bonus of using BPA-free cans.  Unless I get a "bad batch" from Sri Lanka (almost 100% of the negative reviews are from that source), I will forever be a Native Forest user!

review/summary: Delicious Coconut Milk!  No complaints!
review/text: I purchased this product despite the mixed reviews.  I happened to receive the product from Sri Lanka.  The cans that I received were perfectly fine and had no dents.  I tasted it plain, to see if had a good flavor and I thought that it was DELICIOUS.  I used it in my cooking and to make vegan ice cream.  The results were great.  I was surprised to read that some reviews said that this is fatty.  Coconut milk is supposed to be a little fatty.  I typically use this coconut milk in dishes that call for heavy cream, because it provides a healthier spin to any recipe that is compatible with coconut flavors.  I am very pleased to find an organic product that does not have other additives.  This product is a winner!  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />P.S.  Amazon has an amazing return policy.  If you receive products that are damaged in any way, they will refund your money or send you another one, so dented cans should not be a reason not to order this.

review/text: I have read a lot of mixed reviews and was hesitant to purchase this item. I have now ordered 2 cases over the course of 4 months and both were high quality delicious coconut milk. It does seperate (which is normal) so just give the can a good shake before you open it. No dented cans either, but who cares if your can is dented anyway? Relax people, a dent does not effect the quality of the contents of the can.

review/summary: ALL cans dented! Did not even have a chance to try
review/text: This was very disappointing - I was very excited about trying this new organic coconut milk, but when I received the package, ALL cans were dented! ALL of them! How does it make sense that the product is USDA organic and all can are dented? I did not even have a chance to try it. Amazon has a "no refund" policy on the food products, so I could not even return it. Thankfully, customer service was excellent and I was refunded for the product. DO NOT BUY  - WASTE OF MONEY!

review/text: Bought this product at Whole Foods. It is excellent. Sorry to hear about the problems ordering through Amazon, but if you can buy it at Whole Foods or another health food/gourmet grocer, it's great stuff.

review/summary: Fabulous. Silky. Delightful.
review/text: This is the best coconut milk I have ever tasted.  It reminds me of the dairy form of half and half but the texture and taste is silky and light.  My can does state "Product of Thailand".  I purchased at a retail store while traveling.  I'm online looking to purchase.  I'm really surprised it was not rated 5 stars by others.

review/summary: Inconsistent Quality
review/text: I go through a lot of coconut milk and this is the only brand I'll buy because Native Forest is the only company I know of that uses BPA free cans.  However the product is very inconsistent.  Sometime I get wonderful rich thick coconut milk and other times its watery, curdled, and gritty.  The watery stuff does not do well in my recipes at all.  I saw other reviewers said it has to do with whether the cans came from Sri Lanka or Thailand.  I will not be ordering these from amazon.  Even though it is more expensive at the store, I want to be able to make sure I'm getting the thick coconut milk.  It's really unacceptable that two completely different products are being sold as the same product.

review/text: Product arrived in great shape with no dented cans. Milk was separated but label says this is typical in cold weather. Doesn't matter for making curry though, and this made a very tasty curry. Will buy again.

review/summary: Every Can Was Dented - Product Was OK
review/text: Package arrived today and both the outer (Amazon) and inner (product) boxes were completely undamaged but every can inside was dented -- some very minor and others very misshapen. And the damage "location" varies widely, so that means they were damaged BEFORE they were boxed up.  I opened the worst one and tasted the product.  It tastes OK to me, but I don't know for sure that its safe.  Guess I'll know by morning. :o)  Had I known I would be receiving dented cans I may have opted not to purchase, and instead waited for a sale at my local store.  In my opinion Amazon should sell the damaged and undamaged merchandise separately and at different price points.<br /><br />Update:  No issues post sampling :) -- the product inside was indeed OK, so I have increased the rating from 2 to 3 stars.

review/summary: Where do you all get your info from
review/text: I received this product in a very timely manor, in perfect condition no dents. I immediately opened a can and tasted it, very nice thick and smooth coconut milk.<br />I have since had it cooled in the fridge and it is still nice and no separation at all.  I made a shake of it with protein powder and I was delicious.<br />I would like to comment on some of the reviewers here if I may, no insulting just making observations.<br /><br />1) It is sad that the cans came in dented but that is not the fault of Amazon the case comes from the manufacturer in a sealed box, Amazon does not pack it, so if the product is dented inside the box it is the fault of the packers.<br />2) Why would you believe that there is no BPA? just because someone's friend read it somewhere? It is not stated on the can along with, the claims of NON GMO, Kosher, USDA organic, Vegan, Gluten Free.  If it were indeed BPA free they would want to put it on the label with these other claims because it would boost sales.  So it is not BPA free.<br />3) the expiration date is clearly marked on the bottom of each can as well as the case it comes in, mine reads this way: Best Before : 21 FEB 2013, under that it has a number of 05, I think that is where that person got the 07 from he missed the real date or it was rubbed off somehow.  It is hard to believe that all 24 got rubbed off.<br /><br />We all have different tastes  and unfortunately in a business this large there are mistakes, contact the company but please do not give negative reviews if you have not tasted the product at all. This is the review of the product itself not he way it was shipped.<br />You are not hurting the company but you are hurting the people like us who are buyers and count on your true opinion.

review/summary: big disappointment
review/text: I have liked this product in the past but the contents of every can in this shipment (twelve in all) was thin and curdled and had a peculiar grayish cast. I think coconut milk powder ( e.g., from Wilderness Family Naturals) is probably the safest bet when ordering coconut milk/cream on line.

review/summary: Packaging Problems
review/text: I purchased a case of 12 cans. Out of those 12 cans, only four appear to be undented. EIGHT out of 12 are badly dented. The BOX they are packed in is fine so they had to have been dented when they were packed into the box. This is unacceptable quality control. I gave this 2 stars because of this problem from the seller but I don't know yet what to think of the coconut milk itself as I have not yet opened one of the four seemingly undented cans. Some posters here have said the cans are BPA free but the cans don't look high enough quality to be BPA free. Eden Foods use BPA free cans and their cans LOOK high quality. I hope it is true of the Native Forest coconut milk cans but I'm not sure of that. The number of dented cans in an undamaged box is definitely a big disappointment.

review/summary: All 12 cans dented! Love this product/long-time buyer of it; this is my first problem with it ever
review/text: I use coconut milk daily and this is the only coconut milk I buy because I appreciate that Native Forest uses BPA-free cans and is organic.<br />I've been buying this from Amazon for over a year--I used to buy it on subscription before they canceled subscription availability.<br /><br />Up till now there has never been a problem with my orders. But yesterday I received my latest 12 pack and EVERY single can in it is dented. Four had very minor dents near the top, but eight cans had large noticeable dents.<br /><br />While I imagine that the product inside is probably fine, I am very concerned about this lapse in quality control in the manufacturing and/or distibution process. Dents can weaken the metal and introduce tiny cracks that allow contamination of the product.<br /><br />I notice a lot of very recent comments on Amazon stating that others are receiving dented cans as well. I hope Amazon and/or Native Forest will address this.<br /><br />I am not sure if it's a distribution problem--if the cans are being damaged in shipping (they came double boxed from Amazon, so perhaps damage occurs further upstream in the shipping line), or if Amazon is only managing to source damaged cans in the first place, or ...?<br /><br />I want to offer full stars for the product, which I like and truly rely on, but I'm offering a low rating because of the packaging.

review/text: this is great coconut milk, some others don't really mix up well, give it a shake before opening and it's nice and smooth.  It contains no carrageenan like the commercial brands like silk and others.  Was a relief to find such a nice replacement for dairy as I am casein allergic

review/summary: best coconut milk ever
review/text: Love this coconut milk, because it's Nice and thick. So thick I had to use a spatula to get it out of the can. It is semi-sweet but with no sugar added. Found it to be great for Whole 30 diets and Paleo followers. Best non-dairy creamer for coffee.

review/summary: Never had a problem
review/text: I have been ordering this coconut milk for over a year now, I've never had a problem with dented cans but even if I did I don't think that would be a big deal. I care about what's inside the can, not the can itself. As long as you can open the can who cares? I use this in my coffee every morning and love it. I like the fact that the cans are BPA free. I open the can and pour the milk into another container and store in the fridge. Sometimes it separates, sometimes it doesn't, it seems to vary from can to can. I prefer when it doesn't as I use it in my coffee. If I want the solid coconut cream by itself I buy that separately. This has a great flavor and is a lot cheaper than the organic stuff in the grocery stores. I will keep buying!

review/text: 1 Month ago I looked up this product and it was about $23 for a case. I thought good price I will order next month.  I came back to order and the price nearly doubles!!!  What is with that?  Is there a shortage of coconuts?  Does any one know?
