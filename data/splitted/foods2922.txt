review/text: I have always loved redskin peanuts since I was a little girl and discovered them at Sears. Every week my aunt would take me and buy a 1/4 lb. of peanuts. I loved them. These are just as good as I remember. I do love the butter flavor they add. Even if they didn't, I'd still love them. I too, don't understand why they are so hard to find. Keep making them!

review/summary: This Ice Cream Club ROCKS!!!
review/text: Recently, I was gifted the Ice Cream of the Month Club by a very good friend. I was somewhat confused thinking "how the heck can their be an ice cream of the month club?" But, with having given and received numerous "of the month clubs" and having all great experiences in the past, I was curious to see what they had put together here. Needless to say, WHAT A FANTASTIC SURPRISE! The 4 boutique frozen deserts arrived packaged in dry ice and were completely frozen. My girlfriend and I were pretty enthusiastic to dive in and try them all, but took a step back to read the companies review on each of the vendors and brands. We decided that we would begin with the "Berto's Gelato - Roasted Banana True Italian Artisan Gelato." After a single bite, my girlfriend declared that it might be the best gelato she has ever had, and proceeded to eat most of it while we watched TV. The best description she give as she devoured the gelato was saying it was like having "velvet wrapping around your body." The additional flavors included in our shipment were Gilles Sherbet Swirl, Cedar Crest Elephant Tracks Ice Cream, and Oberweis Cookie Dough Classic. Each of the selections were very delicious and from companies I have never heard of. I highly recommend this club to any person looking to give or get an array of tasty desserts that you'll want to find more of once you're done!

review/summary: Be Wary of AmazingClubs Ice Cream of the Month Club
review/text: I ordered the 6 month ice cream of the month club for my wife's birthday.  She received her first shipment today and none of the 4 ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams (you could have bought several of the ice creams, such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip, in your local grocery store).  When I called the 800 number I was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it doesn't "meet their quality" guidelines.  When I told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs, the customer service rep was rude and told me that I needed to call back and talk to someone in their "support group" (note: you must call before 6:00 PM EST to speak to someone in this group). I would seriously caution you to shell out more than $300 for this club.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised!
review/text: Though I am knowledgeable with Lucy Country Licorice, the most seemingly elusive flavour has been the marionberry. To those unfamiliar with this fruit, it is a blackberry hybrid from Marion County, Oregon ( thus the name ), and, as presented in this licorice, is extremely delicious. As is the way with Lucky Country Licorice, this item is aromatic, soft, and solid, leaving the taster wanting more.<br />As presented on Amazon, the only way to improve this product would be to offer it in dozen and halfdozen bags of a smaller size per order; beyound that - which is no actual probelm with the candy itself - this confection stands at the top of  its catagory in terms of desire, flavour, and ingredients. Though one could continue to rave on about this confection, suffice it to say it rates a '10', or a solid 5 stars!

review/summary: I am an adult with GERD
review/text: I recently ended up with GERD and a really bad bleeding ulcer, due to stress and grief.  I have problems keeping food down and went on a baby food diet for the sake of thriving.  Some types of baby food stay down,  where as other types cause me indigestion just as bad as adult food.  This specific sweet potato one seemed to ease my acid refluxing and indigestion and sooth my throat.  I'm not at the point where I can eat the whole container yet,  but this is a good start.  This also has a pleasant taste.  Some of the baby food is just bland and boring,  but this one is alright.  Not the best but still alright. Please be weary if you're having gastrointestinal problems.  Babyfood is such a great idea if you're having problems keeping things in,  and need to retrain your stomach and intestines.  Just be careful,  some are more acidic than others.<br /><br />By the way,  this doesn't have all the nutrients you would need to survive.  As a adult you'd need about 12-16 small jars a day and you'd need to make sure you get enough protein.  So be careful,  this is only a temporary fix for people with ulcers and GERD.

We go through peas so much in my house with my child and this is the only way we are going to buy them from now on. The box is very compact and I just remove the top and leave stored them right in the box. It saves a ton of room in the kitchen, rather than having them tipping over in the cupboard.<br /><br />One surprising thing we also discovered is that our cat who has a low appetite loves this simple pea baby food too. It has been healthy for my baby and a real treat for my pet. Good stuff.

Its also sometimes hard to find in the stores near me that typically have a very meager selection. This eight pack takes care of our needs for a while, and everything comes neatly shipped in a compact little box that you can tear the top of and keep them all together. Every tub arrived and it had a really long expiration date. You cant go wrong!

review/summary: My Son will eat them!
review/text: My son has autism. He is on a gluten-free, casein-free, and soy free diet, so there is not a lot of pre-packaged stuff out there that he can eat that he actually wants to eat. We have tried the Glutino pretzels, they are good but have soy. My typical son on an unrestricted diet likes them and asks for them. But my gf/cf/sf son can't have them.<br /><br />I brought home a few sample bags of these from a TACA meeting (Talk About Curing Autism) and my son ate them right up. I was glad to see them on this site so I could order them in bulk.<br /><br />I tried them and didn't think they tasted bad. Of course, they could use more salt for my taste, but my son gets enough sodium from other sources, so I'm glad that they aren't salted.

review/summary: HIGH FIBER SNACK!!
review/text: I love these small, round 3/4" pretzels!  What sets them apart is that they have 3 gr of FIBER in every serving!  That equals my husband's Metamucil (registered trademark) dietary fiber!  Plus, they taste very good, it's hard to stop snacking...<br /><br />Don't look for alot of salt on the outside, but the overall flavor is salty enough for me. A serving has 230 mg, or 10% of your daily sodium intake.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts: each bag has 4 (30g) servings of 40 pretzels, each serving has 130 calories, 30 from fat, 3.5g total fat, 2g saturated fat (9%), No trans fat or cholesterol, 24g carbohydrate (8%), 3g dietary fiber, 1g sugar, .6g protein.<br /><br />I once bought a bag of the Ener-G GF 2.65 oz. pretzels,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFIIZO">Ener-G Foods Crisp Pretzels, Wheat-Free, 2.65-Ounce Bags (Pack of 20)</a> and they taste great - but each serving has twice the salt, almost twice as much fat (6g), and less than 1g fiber.  That is alot of salt for a snack.  (all the other values are about the same).  Put enough fat and salt in anything, and it will taste good...I choose the Wylde pretzels!<br /><br />PS:  Don't eat these unless you have sound teeth - I had a temporary, plastic crown break while eating them.

review/text: I have a daughter with Autistic Spectrum Disorder... DAN! (Defeat Autism Now!) had an article that implied some connection between gluten and dairy allergies to behavioral difficulties in children with this disorder. So, we decided to try a gluten-free, dairy-free diet to see what happened. I have to say I have seen a good deal of improvement in her general behavior as well as her focus and retention rate.<br /><br />From what I understand it is a good product for kidney patients as well because it is low protein. And it's Kosher Parve.<br /><br />I tried these pretzles because of this new diet and now my whole family is addicted! They are tasty, crunchy and not too salty, but still satisfy my desire for salty foods. We will be buying these from now on.

review/summary: Great gluten-free snack
review/text: I have endometriosis and was looking for snacks that would not aggravate my condition.  These pretzels are so delicious, I can eat them all day with no negative effects.  I will say that people either hate these or love these though.  The people who hate them seem to be males more than females and usually are people who do not have any alergies.  My best work friend (who is vegan) sneaks into my desk constantly for them.  The taste is like eating just the outside crunchy part of a regular pretzel.  They are very crunchy and well suited for travelling, stashing in your office desk, and snacking during surfing the web.  I reccomend these to people with food alergies that miss their wheat snack products and often get a craving for a salty snack.<br />Additionally, I find them to be a great value and they last a long time.  They are less suceptable to getting stale than regular snacks.  I ordered two boxes eight months ago and still have a few bags left.  When I open the new bags, they are just as fresh and tasty as the ones I opened eight months ago.  If you get tired of snacks and want to rotate variety, these pretzels will wait until you are ready to fit them back into your lunch pack.

I tried a smaller bag at the local store for 2 bucks and liked it.  Then, I saw these and it was a much better buy.  Compare prices though, because right now this size isn't the best deal.

review/text: Another great produce carried by Amazon for those suffering from Celiac Disease or anybody else who wants a great tasting crunchy pretzel.  My husband was diagnosed with Celiac Disease 4 years ago.  It has been my goal to make him feel less restricted in a world that is chock full of gluten.  I read every food label of anything I purchase so it is nice to know that there is a wonderful worry-free snack food out there that tastes even better than regular pretzels.  Good thing you can get this product in 4 oz bags or you would not be able to pace yourself. Thanks again Amazon for making such a wonderful produce as Wylde Pretzels available and accessible to all.

I haven't actually tasted a regular pretzel in over 20 years, and I never really liked them anyway.  But these are perfect.  Small, not too salty, and fresh, I think they are a super snack food.  I buy them by the case and so does my father, sister-in-law, and brother.  All have a gluten intolerance and think that these are the best since sliced bread!

review/summary: There are other and BETTER gluten-free pretzels out there...
review/text: We have been a gluten free family for many years and have been enjoying the new products that are now continully being introduced.  These pretzels are not nearly as good as the ones by Ener-G Foods (small size bags) or by Glutano (larger, family size bags).  These Wylde pretzels are, as one reviewer already commented, not salty enough - that is, not salty enough for me to feel they qualify as satisfying a pretzel yearning.  These pretzels are also much harder than the others, which I don't find appealing.  That being said, I would highly recommend the Glutano or the Ener-G Foods pretzels over these.  I rated it 2-stars simply for being another gluten free product.

You will have quite a few left un popped.<br />Add melted butter and sea salt, not bad.<br />Not better than cheap store brands found in plastic bags in your local grocery store, colors are fun though.

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

review/text: We came across the name of this tea in a catalog and my tea drinking grandson just had to try some.  He kept asking me if I had bought some so he could try some.  I got him some for Christmas, he just loved it!  It was however the name that sold it for him.

review/summary: Delicious iced
review/text: I'm a daily iced tea maker and drinker. Bounced around between lots of different teas but settled on plain black tea as my favorite. Found Golden Monkey from a local purveyor which then discontinued it. I loved the clarity and total lack of bitter flavors in the Golden Monkey. The Faerie's golden monkey is just as delicious, and the 12oz package is by far the best deal for this tasty stuff.

review/summary: They claim it is in stock....
review/text: ...and then tell me it is backorderd.<br /><br />In fact, as of this writing, it STILL says in stock, even though they told me it was backordered five days ago.<br /><br />This has been happening with all of my orders to Chinese companies lately. They claim it is in stock and then take six weeks to get it to you. My guess is that they haven't even picked it yet!<br /><br />AMAZON: Please crack down on this practice by Chinese companies! It's ruining your reputation!

review/summary: Great dutch process cocoa
review/text: I'm generally a big fan of Guittard products (try their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049Z7LM2">chocolate chips</a>!)  I've used this cocoa in a number of recipes that required dutch process cocoa and have enjoyed the results.  The "Cocoa Rouge" on the label is no lie, it is an unusual red color, closer to natural cocoa than the dark brown you get with a heavily processed cocoa.  They won't be making Oreos with this stuff.<br /><br />I wish Guittard also made a natural cocoa, but alas.  Guess I'll stick to Ghirardelli and Scharffen Berger for natural cocoa.

review/text: There's nothing I didn't really expect in the pears. They're the quality I expect (similar to any other canned pears). Mostly halves, some smaller pieces. A forgettable sugary water.<br /><br />A few of the pieces had a little spot that seemed to be from the skin not quite being removed - nothing disgusting about it. The reason for ordering - and I re-ordered: a decent price for a case brought to my door.

review/summary: great food!
review/text: My kitty eats all the flavors of Natural Balance Platefulls on rotation, and loves all of them equally. He gets dry food in the morning, and a pouch for dinner every night. His coat is GORGEOUSLY soft and shiny, and these pouches don't give him nasty gas or rowdy bad breath like some other canned/pouch foods. When I first opened a pouch, I saw that it had peas and carrots in it, and I figured those would be left behind in the bowl. Cats just...don't eat vegetables. To my surprise, the bowl was licked clean! And after 3 months, he still licks the bowl clean every night!

review/summary: The Best Noodle Bowl I Can Remember.
review/text: I bought a few of these Nongshim noodle soups because they're easy to store and very handy for making a quick lunch on busy days. The latest I tried today was the Savory Bowl Noodle Soup, Chicken Flavor (3.03 ounces). It was quite good, much better than many other brands I've had in the past. The broth was particularly good. Very tasty. My reservations for food dishes such as this is the high sodium content. The soup doesn't taste particularly salty, but the nutrition label says a lot. I counter this by not having such dishes very often. However, if you're going to have these bowls now and then, this is quite a good one, the best I can remember.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: The cinnamon has a very good flavor, I really like it.  It's milder and I don't seem to need as much sugar when I make a cinnamon, sugar mix to sprinkle on toast.  My only concern is the way it is packaged.  It does not come in a sealed jar.  Anyone could open it and contaminate it with something and you would never know.  If it had some kind of seal I would give it 5 stars!

review/summary: Very Weak Coffee
review/text: I generally use one tablespoon of coffee per cup in my drip maker. To get a drinkable cup out of this hazelnut I had to use two tablespoons per cup, effectively doubling the cost of this coffee.<br /><br />I also did not enjoy the flavor of this hazelnut. It has a bitter edge similar to the bitterness you might taste in a pot of coffee that was brewed with a dollop of cocoa powder added to the grounds.

review/summary: great healthy drink
review/text: We mix this with sparkling water for our granddaughters and they think they're really getting a treat! I've tried several other brands of grape juice but none of them are nearly as good as Welch's. It's a great way to get the resveratrol antioxidant. You might want to get some Fruit Fast pomegranate concentrate, put a couple of pumps of it in your glass, add the Welch's, then mix and it's heavenly!<br />We don't drink soda so this is a way to feel pampered and decadent while sticking to our commitment to good health. Buying it on Amazon is much cheaper than any store in our town; believe me I've priced it everywhere as it indeed is a more pricey drink. Worth every penny, and the health benefits are huge!

Be warned this is no Girlie-man coffee, it is strong, but the secret is to drink it the way they serve it in New Orleans, that is, half a cup of this freshly brewed coffee, and the other half fill with fresh cream ... take a walk on the wild side my friends, this is the real thing, you will not be dissapointed!

review/text: I'm planning to purchase some of this coffee for at-home use.  My sister introduced it to me, and I can drink it without heartburn!  I've had to give up coffee since I began having LPR (laryngopharyngeal reflux), but since this is blended with chicory, the acidity must be greatly reduced.  I can have a cup first thing in the morning with no problems.  The taste is amazing.....and this is coming from a Starbucks lover.  Cafe Du Monde is my favorite coffee in a long, long time.
