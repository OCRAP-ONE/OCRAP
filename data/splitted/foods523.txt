review/summary: Best caramel corn ever
review/text: So you know that weird aftertaste you get when you eat somewhat artificial snacks? Well guess what, this fleur de sel caramel corn doesn't leave you with that! It amazes me that they can produce this totally crisp, and fresh product without using corn syrup and other unnatural favors that overwhelm my snack corner. This is an awesome snack and the more you eat it, the more you can taste the welcoming salt flavor.  It's really different from the basic caramel corns I've had, but in a GOOOD way, I definitely recommend this to all!!!

review/summary: Tasty flavor
review/text: I order this product after seeing a segment on a National news program. With the new trend of coupling sea salt and various flavors I was excited to try this product. I gave a bag to my parents before I tried it, they really like caramel. They did not respond with the enthusiasm I expected. They said they would have never known there was salt if I hadn't told them. So then I tried a bag. I feel the same. Maybe I was expecting more. But the picture on the front of the kernel with Sea Salt and the kernels in the bag didn't match. The popcorn itself was crisp with a good caramel flavor but I would have liked a bit more salt granules added. Save your money, purchase regular Caramel Corn at the grocers.

review/summary: Finest Supreme Monkey Picked Oolong Tea ........ or just OK, to mediocre.
review/text: After having tried this Oolong style tea in a friends Chinese restaurant (which was her personal stock) I set out to try to purchase something similar.  My friend is from Fuzhou, PRC and her family works in the tea industry there.  The product she gave me to drink was lighter or more delicate tasting in flavor or quality.  This product is not all that smooth and mediocre when compared to the type she had.  This product did maintain that characteristic good Monkey Picked Oolong Teas of never becoming more bold in taste as the tea steeps longer all the way through your drinking experience. Preparing the tea in your YiXing teapot chinese style will improve your experience and  is better than typically American style brewing. It seems priced close to some of the offerings on the net.  I will not fault the service of the company.  This product is slightly less refined than some picks.

review/summary: great simple healthy snack
review/text: "Blue Diamond Almonds, Whole Natural" are whole "raw" almonds in a 1.5 ounce pack.  They're great for staving off hunger and have no added salt or ingredient besides almonds.<br />Although you could easily make these yourself in snack bags, the Blue Diamond packs offer convenience and better shelf life.<br /><br />The package is a tube like bag, so you can pour them into your mouth - you don't even need clean hands to eat these. Great with a fresh fruit smoothie for a convenient "meal" in a hurry.  Excellent for travel or carrying to work or class for a mess free snack.

review/summary: Smaller than Expected but Still Good
review/text: I bought these for my candy buffet at my wedding. The packaging is pretty poor, they are basically free in a box with no shrink wrap around the box itself, so sugar was all over the packaging and I worry about the candy going stale. The slices themselves are also smaller than what you'd typically find, which isn't necessarily bad, but just a word to the wise. The product does have good flavor and a very nice texture, a bit firmer than most fruit slices I've tried.

review/text: Be careful with this one.  I thought I was buying what's pictured: a box of 6 packs of 12.  The low price should have been a giveaway, but I just figured it was old stock that they wanted to get rid of and I was only buying it to use in an activity in our Vacation Bible School.  When I received my one little box of 12 today, I went back to their amazon listing to see what happened, and sure enough, there is a warning that what's pictured is not a representation of what you're buying, and nowhere do they state exactly how many Fizzie tabs you're buying.  I wonder how many other people have been burned the same way.  If it's been a problem in the past, what they should do is post an accurate photo and accurate description.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />I will NOT be buying anything from this merchant again.

Not the greatest cashews I've had but okay.

review/summary: Tasty, vegan, plentiful
review/text: I've only had onion soups that were beef broth based in the past and was curious to see how this vegan onion noodle soup would be.  It's very light - not overly oniony, but having a lively 'black pepper' type spice flavor to it.  The noodles are rice noodles and plentiful in this cup of soup.<br /><br />Good things about this cup of soup:<br /><br />-The portion is a good size; I would estimate 14-16 ounces prepared?<br /><br />-The flavor packet comes separate, so that the powder does not congeal or settle to the bottom of the cup in a concrete-like mass.  I remember this being a problem back in the 90's with healthy soup cup varieties.<br /><br />-The sodium count is 14% which is fairly low.<br /><br />-The whole cup of soup has 180 calories.<br /><br />Great portability, easy prep.  Nice to have on hand in the office for a quick snack or part of lunch.

review/summary: A very nice, low-cal, instant noodle soup without the junk additives, thanks Dr. McD
review/text: I've tried various Dr. McDougall's products (as I'm lazy in the kitchen and anything quick to fix, but healthful, is a boon). This is one of the nicer soups. I didn't give it 5 stars, which I'll explain below, but I still recommend this to folks who like instant noodle soups, but want something vegan, vegetarian, non-gluten, or without a lot of added junk.<br /><br />For a mere 180 calories, this is a very generous serving of soup with pleasantly-textured rice noodles. The flavor packet (with dried veggie mix including shallots, garlic, green onions, white onions) mixes in without lumps. It is microwaveable, but I like adding boiling water and letting it sit a few minutes. The broth is very "oniony", and if you don't like a strong onion/garlic flavor, this is not for you.<br /><br />The one star removed is for me finding it too salty. This almost has 700 mg per cup, which may not sound like too much for convenience soup, but I found it was very salty to my taste--and I love salt. I also found that there is a very faint, slightly unappealing undertaste (again, YMMW, it might just be my taste buds), that kept it from being a five-star soup for me. That said, I enjoy this soup, and I would order it again, simply because it's hard for me to find a noodle instant soup that satisfies me in the taste and texture dept. This one has lovely texture and a pretty decent flavor, and it doesn't have the artificial colors and flavors or trans fats that I don't want or need.<br /><br />Another good Dr. MCD product! And with the subscription option, comes out to a tad over a buck fifty for soup for lunch. I like that, too.

review/summary: Good flavor, organic vegan product
review/text: Dr. McDougall Right Foods food cups are, for the most part, excellent.  The ingredients are of a good quality, and most have a good taste to them.<br /><br />The two downsides of the product are that they're relatively high in sodium, and of course the cost.<br /><br />The food cups are perfect for those who want a quick snack, and they also work well when poured over such as pasta, rice, or a baked potato.

review/summary: Our favorite kind
review/text: First off, buying these Noodle Soups, it's rare that any of them taste GREAT.  Nothing tastes like homemade.  But, comparing Dr. McDougalls Soups to stuff like Ramen noodles, etc....well, there's no comparison.  Ramen may be cheap...but the sodium content and crap content alone will kill you.<br /><br />We've tried several kinds of these Dr. McDougalls, and our favorite happens to be the Spring Onion.  Very tasty (to us).  Also very eatable, unlike some other brands I won't mention.  I also see there are some lower sodium ones we're gonna try next.

review/text: I bought this soup based on the reviews, I was looking into getting something besides Cup Of Noodles. I should have listened to the my inner fat man and stuck to the bad for you soup. Not only did this have a horrible taste, but it also didn't offer enough to eat as a meal alternative. The soup is easy to make, but the bland noodles, tasteless soup will leave you wanting to throw up and kicking Dr.McDougall's in the nuts.

review/summary: Horrible taste and smell
review/text: I purchase a lot of baby food in bulk through Amazon.  This is the first food that I've found that not only would my little one not eat, he literally gagged on it.  I tried it myself and found that it tastes terrible.  There's something in it I can't quite put my finger on, but it is wretched.  In an attempt to see if it was just us, I gave the remaining case to a friend of mine whose daughter is 3 weeks younger than my son.  He also said she gagged on it and wouldn't eat it.  It 20 pouches ended up in the trash.  I wouldn't recommend this unless you've purchased just one and know that your little one will eat it.

review/summary: Overprocessed Salt
review/text: If there is no wholesome food available, this could do.  However, this is high in salt, low in fiber, high in carbohydrates (tastes like sweet candy), and uses highly processed ground turkey.  Even gourmet pet food offers real chunks of meat.  This is supposed to be for advanced babies, but it's mushy with bits of ground turkey and corn kernel peels.  It would be good to see more WHOLE bits of food, less salt, less sweetness, more fiber, and cuts of real meat (not highly processed ground mystery turkey) with more meat.  It is healthier for me to use frozen vegetables with meat than this Sprout concoction.  They get two stars for trying to be organic.

review/summary: Little one loves it!
review/text: This was the first Sprout Organic Baby Food I'd given my son.  From the first bit he loved it and ate the whole pouch in just minutes.  He's normally takes his sweet baby time to eat so I was thrilled to find something he'd literally gobble up.  The packaging is a bit difficult to deal with, I'm not a big fan of the pouches, I always feel like I'm leaving money in the bottom of the pouch and not too thrilled about the high sodium content.  But he loves it, he'll eat it, it's relatively healthy, and since I don't have time to make him gourmet, organic, hand mashed foods on a regular basis, this works great for us.

review/summary: Baby likes it.
review/text: This Turkey Dinner is one of only two Sprout Stage-3 meals that my baby will eat.  (She's now 13 months old, and has been eating these meals since she was about 10 months old).  Unlike many of the other Sprout Stage-3 foods, this one isn't overly thick and chewy.  There are visible bits of vegetables and turkey meat, but they are very manageable, so they don't make my little-one gag or quit eating because the food is too difficult to chew with the few teeth that she has.  It smells pretty good, too ... Like real "cooked" food, rather than ground-up "baby food."  Most importantly, my baby loves it and routinely opens her mouth very wide for additional spoonfuls.  This has become one of our "go-to" meals when there's no time for a home-cooked meal or finger-foods.

Calories: 140; Total Fat: 4 grams; Sodium: 20mg; Carbs: 24 grams; sugars: 4 grams (Since there is 20 grams difference between the carbs and the sugars, this generally indicates there are no additional sugars added and what IS there is from the natural sugar in the veggies) Fiber: 2 grams; Protein 4 grams;  In fact, I have looked at several of the Sprout baby food packages and their sodium is quite low.  I was in the middle of the ordering process to get this from Amazon when the review caught my attention in regard to the sodium content and I had to comment!

review/text: My son loves the Sprout pouches of food, and I think this one may be his favorite.  I taste all of his baby food, and I must say that this one is very tasty.  (I don't want to feed him anything that I would find disgusting, as is the case with a good deal of baby food out there.)  It is made with wholesome ingredients, and it is great for travel or on-the-go meals because you don't need to refrigerate before opening.  My son gets very excited when he sees that I'm opening up a Sprout pouch!  I've been very happy with all Sprout products I've tried, and this one is no exception.

review/text: If you've never tried Kona coffee, Aloha Island is definitely the one to start with.  <p>Kona coffee is grown in the Kona district of the Big Island and regarded by some to be the best coffee in the world.  I'm not a coffee aficionado by any means, but you can taste the difference with Kona coffee - it's full and rich and almost mocha-ish.  I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).  Obviously, it gets more expensive as you go up the ladder.  The gold is very good and a great place to start sampling their fare.

I don't wanter bitterness, but I love coffee with kick to it.<br /><br />I'd call it too mild but that's kind of oversimplifying it. It's worth a try to make up your own mind though.

review/summary: Inferior Coffee
review/text: Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price. I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage. I would never buy anything from Aloha Island Coffee company again.

review/text: A friend of mine introduced me to the Liquid Aminos when I had to strictly lower my sodium  intake. It was hard to find in several grocery stores. Once you use this, you'll never use soy sauce again, not even low sodium soy sauce. It also gives steamed vegetables a lot of flavor without the use of salt.<br />A 4 pack bought at Amazon is cheaper than buying it in the store. And you'll be surprised how much you use once you've tried it on some of your favorite foods that have always needed salt. I have had friends and family try it, and their families love it now.<br /><br />Give it a try. Maybe start with one small bottle, and then get your 4-pack here for a much better deal.

review/summary: Nice coffee - RIP OFF price!
review/text: I bought a BIG jar of this coffee from the local Tesco store the last time I was visiting home in the UK. It cost about 5 GBP. When I ran out I wanted to replace it and found this listing on Amazon. Notice there is NO information  about the size of the jar. The only clues are the whopping great price tag ($15.49), the insane amount for delivery ($6.45) and the shipping weight (1.2 lbs). I reasonably expected this to be the big size based on that information. WRONG!<br /><br />I received my order very quickly, it was well packaged and the coffee IS pretty good. BUT...the jar is only the 100g size which is TINY! I expect a markup on European goods  because they've come a long way to get to the US, but this is ridiculous. I can only assume that the lack of size information is a deliberate and blatant attempt to sucker people in. So well done, Enjoy Better Coffee, you got me. However, I won't be a repeat customer and I'll happily post this review to dissuade others from patronizing your rip off company.<br /><br />UPDATED 12/08/09<br />I see they've added the size of the jar (100g), so at least you know what you're getting. But it's still a rip off.

review/summary: The same in EU
review/text: Just came back from my vacation in Poland (what a great country; our hotels & shopping places cannot come close to their new ones!)<br />Because their economy is truly fantastic - I paid for exactly the same coffee (even better) Carte Noire Expresso Gold Instant something about 20~22 zloty's.<br />After transferring to US dollar - about $6.00. Voila!<br />Is this price on this page for real? Wouldn't be cheaper to buy a whole box in Poland and mail to my address in Wisconsin?<br />By the way, this coffee is absolutely marvelous!!! For the taste 5 stars.

review/summary: The best tasting instant imaginable
review/text: There is just no other instant coffee which can even begin to compare to Carte Noire, and when I moved from the UK to the US a few years ago, I was disappointed to discover that it isn't in the shops here (at least, not that I have ever been able to discover) so I was very pleased to see it on Amazon.<br /><br />But the price... wow &lt;fans self> this isn't for every day drinking anymore. My husband bought me a jar as a treat at Christmas though, and it was absolutely lovely to have it again.<br /><br />I think next time I go back to the UK for a visit I will probably half fill my suitcase with coffee for the return trip! I have seen that Carte Noire now sells 150g of their instant coffee in lightweight bags, as well as the heavy glass 100g and 200g jars (the larger jars weigh 460g when they are empty) so it won't be such a big extra weight in the suitcase anymore.

review/summary: Amazing coffee, ridiculous price.
review/text: I drink this coffee like crack when in Europe and always manage to bring a couple jars back with me. For instant coffee, the taste is superb - you don't want to drink anything else, but I can't justify paying this much for one small jar of instant coffee.<br /><br />Completely agree with SoldierMan's review - the taste deserves 5 stars, and if you happen to find them while outside of the States, it probably would be cheaper to just buy a bunch and ship them back to yourself!<br /><br />For the time being, I'll hold myself over with 2 pack of the ground version from Amazon and see how that compares ($20 for a total of 17.6 oz - about 500 grams), because my husband and I are seriously in withdrawal for that coffee. Time to break out the coffee press! Yes, it's that good.<br /><br />Kraft owns this brand, you'd think they would release it in the States, too. :(

review/text: There is a food truck not far from me with some pretty good chicken, fried biscuits and fries.  The chicken is smoked then fried.  I immediately noticed a cayenne-like seasoning which was awesome, and not at all too spicy.  When I went back, I asked the man for extra seasoning.<br />He gave me the whole bottle to use as much as I like and turns out it was Tone's Cayenne. Now, I must order this!  Trust me, sprinkle this stuff on some fries along with honey (the way these guys do at the food truck)  you'll never look at fries the same way.  I was literally licking my styrofoam container.  It also works wonders on smoked/fried chicken.  Love it!

review/text: Quite simply, the best k-cup tea in my opinion. If you like rooibos tea and like pears, this one is hard to go wrong with. It has a very slight hint of pear flavor, so you aren't overwhelmed. I love drinking it with a little honey and cream/milk. If you have never had rooibos (an african red tea), it has a very mild flavor with almost no bitter aftertaste that a lot of other tea has. It has no caffeine and is very smooth.

review/summary: A Different Flavor, But Different In a Good Way
review/text: Have just ordered a few more cases.  :)<br /><br />For those who have never tried it before, your first experience with it would be that of a very sweet flavor at first taste with a barely-there hint of pear flavor.  The more you drink of it the less sweet it seems.  Some in the family like it with the usual cream & sugar but I prefer it with nothing else added.  We typically use the 8oz setting but on occasion will do the 6oz setting (but there is no point in using the smaller cup size setting to get the extra taste if you're going to end up putting cream & sugar in it anyway, mind you).<br /><br />It is a flavor that gets some getting used to but it works wonderfully as an after-dinner tea or mid-afternoon drink.  If you are looking for a 'different' flavor, give this a try.

I don't hate it, but will find trouble trying to finish the 48 cups I bought.  I think anyone who buys this must have tasted Rooibos tea before. I love the organic part of this drink.  I did not find this tea weak, the flavor is just bland, except for the slight woody aroma, and an earthy taste.  It is unique alright, but not like a tea to me. Maybe it takes getting used to.

I find vanilla in general to be a bit plain on its own.  However vanilla puddings can easily be used in a multitude of desserts.  Use the pudding between layers of a layer cake, add the pudding to cake batter for a moister cake, or use in trifles.  Homemade pudding is always the best, but when time or skill is lacking, this product is an excellent alternative.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Easy and quick to prepare<br /><br />Consistent pudding every time<br /><br />Versatile product for use in many desserts<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />It's a mix (But who regularly makes homemade pudding these days?)

review/text: Perhaps I'm a little biased since this gum tastes exactly like my favorite melon flavored ice cream but this really is the most delicious gum I've ever chewed in my life. If you're looking for a long lasting gum, this is NOT the gum for you. The gum does not last long and after about an hour of chewing, it begins to get too soft. If you're looking for a fresh breath minty gum, this is also NOT the gum for you. The gum great as a sugarfree alternative for those with a sweet tooth. 5 stars for flavor only.

review/text: After years of using Amazon, this is my very first review! (Sorry for being such a slacker).<br /><br />A friend gave us some Palm Island Salts (black, red and green) as a housewarming gift and we really love them all. Our favorite is the black, which is just amazing, but this red is a close 2nd. It's amazing what a difference it makes in the food we cook, compared to other sea salts we use, and all our guests take notice when I use it! We still use Redmond Sea Salt for day-to-day cooking, and it's very good too, but whenever we want to add something special, we add the black or the red. A single 6-ounce pouch lasted us about 6 months, so a little goes a long way.

review/text: Couscous is finally a very popular alternative to rice, pasta and potatoes in the USA, but most of the couscous is not produced in Morocco.  My first taste of couscous was years ago in Paris and the Dari brand is the most similar to what I tasted first in 1975.  You do not need a couscous pot for this product, but you certainly can prepare the traditional meal by separating individual semolina grains into light, fluffy particles by rubbing it between the hands if you so desire.  With neither the inclination nor time, you can prepare it as simply as you'd like by using a microwave, boiling water and a few fluffs with a fork.  Dari produces semolina, barley and corn couscous at this time and I'm looking forward to trying the barley which is currently available on Amazon.

This company sells different types of Foie Gras, they have a Grade A or B, they have de-veined and they have fully cooked. This was a Grade A which was not de-veined, but it only had 1 small vein in it which was very easy to remove. We spread this Foie Gras on toast and also cooked some on top of deer tenderloin & backstrap. I think this Fois Gras is the closest you'll get to the traditional French Foie Gras. It arrived in a styrofoam cooler box with 4 freezer packs in it and it was still cold when delivered. I give it a 5 stars and will buy it again.

I sealed the lobes in plastic wrap and foil but it was too late to serve them on Christmas Eve, so I waited until a pre-New Year's Eve party. I served the cured foie-gras with cherry jam and sliced baguette, along with some candied walnuts. It was gone in twenty minutes. Everyone complimented on the smooth texture and taste of the liver.<br /><br />I will be ordering this from now on every Christmas.

review/text: If you knew how foie gras was produced, you probably wouldn't buy it. Ducks are intensively raised from birth, their toes cut off so that their talons don't have to be maintained. They are manhandled so forcefully that many ducks break wings or legs or sometimes even necks. They are forced into individual cages and remain there, until they are forcefed fat through long metal tubes, to swell their livers. They are given so much food that they struggle to breathe. This happens 3 times a day. Sometimes, the ducks don't survive this maltreatment, and their bodies are thrown into wastebins.<br /><br />I am not a vegetarian but I believe that it is wrong to intensively raise animals in this way. Please show your support and boycott the sale of foie gras.
