review/summary: Great for dogs with sensitive skin and stomachs
review/text: I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.  I highly recommend if your dog shares these issues... get this food, mix it with some sensitive skin wet food or even salmon... your dog with thank you!

review/summary: amazing for skin conditions!
review/text: My dog is 3 and he has been chewing and licking his paws for as long as I can remember.  Probably half his day was spent chewing and licking.  He has had many steroid shots and has been taking claritin twice a day for several months.  Nothing has worked....I decided to try this dog food before taking him to a specialist and it has been amazing.  He has been eating the salmon and potatoes formula exclusively for about a week and a half and now he is hardly ever licking his paws!!!  Today I even skipped his claritin and he has not licked his paws all day.  No more grains for my dog!

review/summary: Maybe just not for my dog?
review/text: I bought this food for my dog (who has very sensitive skin), and, maybe either a) it is not for him, or, b), I didn't introduce it gradually enough, but, he did develop some vomiting and loose stools when eating (fed him only for about 3 days).  It sounds like fabulous food, with quality ingredients, but, I am afraid to give him any more, since I don't know if he can handle/tolerate it.  I still have about 32 lbs. of this food left at my house :)

review/summary: Not so great..Expiration date soon..
review/text: I decided to try this dry food on my two dogs, because of all the great reviews.<br /><br />However....Neither dog will eat it.  One dog took a couple bites, and refuses to eat it..The other dog wont even take a bite.<br />I tried mixing it with their favorite can food, but this only made matters worse.  They would not even touch it.<br /><br />I was confused about this, since one of my dogs will eat just about anything, while the other will eat dry food mixed with cannned.<br />The reviews were all good, so...<br /><br />I checked the package...And, I think I may have found the answer...There is a last sale date of April 11, 2012....That's only about 6 weeks away.<br />I would never purchase a food that was going to expire so soon, even on sale in a store.<br /><br />I now have a huge bag of dog food in the kitchen..I have tried daily to give each dog a little, but no go.  They will not eat eat it!<br />The pieces are all the same size and color...Not appealing, and there is not even a smell that says "eat me, I am food".  Could be cardboard, judging by<br />the dog's reaction.<br /><br />Kind of hard to return, since it is opened and is 18 pounds of dog food.<br />I have a feeling it is either because the food is so old, or it is tainted.  Dogs can sense when there is a problem with food!<br /><br />Sorry about the bad review...But, This was money that will just end up getting poured into the rubbish.<br />Maybe I was only the unlucky one...Check the last sale dates on your package if any of your dogs wont eat it!<br /><br />I will stick to Pedigree and Mighty Dog..less expensive, not as healthy, but both my dogs love it.<br />I cannot recommend this brand..I have two large dogs, mixed breed and are not usually choosy about what they eat.<br />Except for the Premium Edge, which they give  a paws down to!

review/text: I purchased this because I have a hard time finding good quality chorizo locally.  This was not quite as spicy as I expected, but the flavor and texture were excellent (if I need a touch more heat, I can get it in a number of ways.)  It was very good just for snacking, I cooked some with scrambled eggs and a little onion for a nice breakfast burrito, and we have used it in huevos rancheros.  I will be keeping some on hand from now on.

review/summary: Great Taste
review/text: I love the Pumpkin Spice K-Cup!  I typically drink bold and extra bold coffees - and the Pumpkin Spice doesn't qualify as either.  But it smells just like pumpkin pie....and tastes pretty close to it as well.  One thing I found out though is to definitely add some kind of sweetener (whether it be artifical sweetener or sugar).  I always drink coffee with just cream...and when I did so with the Pumpkin Spice, I really didn't think much of it.  However, as soon as I added a packet of artificial sweetener, the pumpkin flavor just came to life and I loved it!  So even if you don't typically add sweetener, try it with and without - and I'd be willing to bet that you'll like it much better with the sweetener.<br /><br />On a side note, do a little price shopping.  Amazon typically has good prices on a number of things, but not always on K-Cups.  Normal pricing is $13.95 for boxes of 22 or 24 (some kinds come in quantities of 22...others are 24).  If you sign up for the "Subscribe and Save", you'll save 15%....so that's a good deal.  But do the math on some of these other quantities - make sure you're not paying more than $13.95 for 22/24 cups.  Otherwise, it's not a good deal.

review/summary: Great! One of my favorite flavored coffees!
review/text: If you like other Green Mountain flavored coffees, especially if you like the other seasonal light-roast flavors, you will probably like this one.  I really liked the Green Mountain Blue-Berry and thought I would try this and am very pleased.  It seems like a great fit for the fall.  The flavor and aroma seem a bit stronger than in the blue-berry.  Like the blue-berry, this is a light roast.  At first I thought light would mean weak, but it seems like the perfect match for the flavor so that it is still coffee and nicely flavored without either over-powering the other.  It is nothing like a starbucks.  So if you want a strong coffee taste above all, then this isn't one for you, but if you want a nice flavored light coffee, I think it is great.<br /><br />Like other flavored coffees, you should only brew this on the normal default coffee cup size (6oz) on the Keurig brewer or you will water it down if you use the mug size or larger.

review/summary: Wok Mei Oyster Sauce
review/text: I was led to this product after researching sodium hydroxide which was listed as an ingredient on a bottle of oyster sauce in the store.  I didn't see the brand that I normally purchased and was looking for a substitute.  After learning that there is a food grade sodium hydroxide and it is commonly found in fruit and vegetable washes, which I don't use, I decided that I wasn't interested in eating lye, food grade or not, and I started searching for a natural product and Wok Mei came up in the search results.<br /><br />Even though the oyster sauce that I normally used didn't list any unusual ingredients, the Wok Mei oyster sauce wins hands down in terms of flavor, and it has made a noticeable difference in my stir frys.<br /><br />I purchased mine directly from the Honest Foods website in search of a better price on shipping.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite veggie stir frys.<br /><br />Bok Choy<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />1 tbsp vegetable oil<br />1 tbsp sesame oil<br />1 tsp freshly grated ginger<br />1 lb bok choy, sliced<br />1/4 cup water<br />2 garlic cloves, pressed or minced<br />1 tbsp oyster sauce<br />1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce<br />1 tbsp brown sugar<br />1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, optional<br /><br />Directions<br /><br />Cut end off bok choy, keep stalks together and slice.  Keep white stem pieces separate from green leafy pieces.  The white pieces need to cook a little longer than the leaves.  Keeping stem pieces and leaves separate, rinse and place in a salad spinner.  Or rinse and drain in a colander and pat with a paper towel to remove some of the water.<br /><br />To make the sauce, combine water, garlic, oyster sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper flakes, if using, in a small bowl and set aside.<br /><br />Heat a 14" wok or large skillet over medium high heat. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DDVUE">Joyce Chen Traditional 14-Inch Flat Bottom Wok Set</a>  Combine the oil in a small bowl.  Add � of the oil mixture to the wok and swirl around to coat sides.  Stir in ginger.  Quickly add white stem pieces to wok and stir fry 2 - 3 minutes or until pieces start to turn a pale green color and are slightly softened or are of desired tenderness.  Stir or toss the pieces frequently.<br /><br />Add remaining oil to wok and add the leaves.  Stir fry 1-2 minutes or until the leaves are wilted.  Remove from heat and place bok choy in a serving dish.<br /><br />Pour the sauce into the wok.  Cook over medium high heat 3 or 4 minutes or until the sauce is slightly thickened.  Stir constantly to keep the sauce from burning.  Pour over bok choy and serve.

review/summary: Not bad for a powdered drink!
review/text: I picked up some Ocean Spray to Go mixes lately because of two reasons: one being that I was getting a wee bit tired of Crystal Light's stuff but also because Ocean Spray happens to be cheaper than CL. I have to say that while it could have been better in some ways, I did enjoy the cran-grape flavor.<br /><br />The flavor isn't bad. It isn't overly sweet, which is a good thing because too many powdered drink mixes use tons & tons of sugar or sugar substitutes. The flavor kind of reminded me of the grape juice most places use for communion wine. (Not a bad flavor, I must admit.) I also liked how many I got per package- I get 10 powder packets per box, which is more than I get in some of the CL boxes.<br /><br />There's only two things that I kind of didn't like about this product. The flavors are nice but I can't imagine myself drinking more than one of these a day. I usually drink quite a bit of flavored drinks at work as a way of avoiding soda & coffee, so this drink was a little much for something to drink repeatedly. Since I usually drink different flavors as the day go on, this shouldn't be that much of an issue & lots of people probably would love to drink a million of these a day if they could. (Just my personal taste, though.) I also wish that there were a few more vitamins added into this drink. I like that there's a lot of vitamin C in the drink, but I like the idea of getting several different vitamins & healthy things in my powdered drink mixes. (It makes me feel better about not drinking plain water.)<br /><br />Still, this is a nice product & I recommend it. At the current price here on amazon ($19.97 for 10 boxes), this would be a better deal than if you were to buy 10 boxes at your local supermarket. (Mine charges about $2.99-ish per box.)

review/text: This isn't my only "favorite" hot sauce (sadly, I have about 15 I call "favorite") but it is the most versatile.  It goes well, as others have mentioned, on sushi, but it has a bit of a garlicy note, so feel free to try it on pasta (in my house we call it "pizza sauce" but we just add it to the top, not in lieu of tomato sauce), pizza, sandwiches, in soups (especially tomato!), added to salsa (or just plain on chips)...the list goes on.  I like this over the other famous US hot sauce (T*bas*o)because Sriracha isn't as vinegary so it doesn't over power flavors as easily.  Great stuff!  Give it a try.

review/summary: Wonderful and Refreshing
review/text: I first tried Bitter Lemon while on a business trip to Germany.  It was the first drink I tried in the Lufthansa lounge and I was immediately hooked.<br /><br />It is a very refreshing drink, especially after a long trip over the Atlantic.  The carbonation makes it clearly different than lemonades here in the USA.  There were many different brands in Germany (including one by the Coca-cola company).  I've not been able to find any here in the US.  I've tried package stores and upscale liquor stores....nothing.<br /><br />I wish they sold it in 2L bottles.

review/summary: As Good As Schweppes
review/text: I'm not sure why Schweppes is no longer distributing in the United States to grocery stores, but Fever-Tree makes a viable alternative.  The product is comparable.  Not better, not worse.  The taste is very good.  I would say the main difference is that Fever-Tree's bitter lemon does not have lemon sediment swirling around the bottom of the bottle.  I didn't miss it.  This product is expensive but considering the quality and availability, I will be buying more.<br /><br />One more thing... the packaging was excellent.  24 bottles come in packages of four.  The lot is shrink wrapped and tightly packed in a cardboard box surrounded with styrofoam on all six sides.  The bottles arrived in perfect condition.

review/summary: The Best Bitter Lemon
review/text: When you want to really taste the perfect balance of lemon and quinine, this is your beverage.  Also, it is highly carbonated which means that when poured over ice with gin or vodka, it has the perfect amount of bubbles.  Not so highly carbonated you can't drink it straight from the bottle.  Or, as I like to say, "perfect."<br /><br />I have had four different brands of bitter lemon and none of the others compare to Fever Tree.<br /><br />Also, I haven't gotten malaria.

review/text: This product is a great mixer. First tried this product in Europe as an alternative to tonic mixer with gin. This product uses cane sugar in contrast to the best known American bitter lemon product which uses corn syrup. I think the product just needs marketing over here in the U.S. because my U.S. friends who have tried it all find itn refreshing as a mixer.

review/summary: Better than the other brand
review/text: When I found Fever-Tree Premium Bitter Lemon, I had been searching for a retailer that sold another well-known brand of bitter lemon. I found that the other brand was still sold in Great Britain or Europe, but it was unavailable in the United States. My girlfriends were having to substitute other mixers to get the flavor they were seeking for gin and bitter lemon drinks. I decided it was worth the investment to try the Fever-Tree Premium Bitter Lemon and give it to them for Christmas with a good bottle of gin. They both agreed that the Fever-Tree was even better than the brand they were familiar with. They fixed me a sample drink and I was impressed with the lemon flavor and the level of the carbonation. My girlfriends explained that bitter lemon by itself made a refreshing summer time drink. We all agreed that Fever-Tree Premium Bitter Lemon was one of the better gifts I had ever given them.

review/summary: Rather Pricey but Superb
review/text: Makes a beautiful vodka/gin drink. A 6.8 ounce bottle is good for two of them.....don't like my booze too diluted.<br />At about US$1.35 per small bottle it is rather pricey but it's definitely of connoisseur quality.<br />If it wasn't for "super saver" free shipping, it would be outrageously expensive since the standard shipping charge for 24 bottles is $16.00.<br />It's my guess that the importer is picking up the shipping cost and is doing so to get more people to try their beverages. Don't know how much longer this will last.<br />If I would have to pay the shipping cost I'd purchase Fever Tree locally instead. The price would be a lot less than the cost with shipping added.<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />ATTENTION: The price for a 24 pack of this excellent mixer has just gone up here at Amazon to $45 from $33 with no Super Saver option  making it just too expensive now.<br />If I want some, I'll buy it locally for $6.00 per 4 pack plus tax.<br />If it goes higher than $6.00 per 4 pack I'm done with it.<br />If it returns to its previous $33 with Super Saver Option I'll continue to order from Amazon, otherwise I'll just forget about it.

review/summary: Pretty Incredible.... On my top 10 list of foodie indulgances
review/text: I was skeptical that this bacon would be that much better than other high quality bacon, let alone $16+/lb better. But I'd heard about the wonders of mangalitsa pork before and wanted to try it in some way before deciding whether it was worth seeking out in other forms.<br />Well, I was amazed. And what's more is that everyone in our family agreed that the difference was highly noticeable. Hard to believe.<br />I got the bacon for Thanksgiving. I trimmed off some of the fat (reserved for other uses) and wrapped prunes to bake. The rendered fat was partially used for a potato dish, but it lasted quite awhile. Fantastic stuff. We also used some of the bacon in the stuffing, but its particular flavour couldn't really shine amongst all the other ingredients. What was left made the most incredible bacon bits for a salad that you have EVER tasted. Gosh that was good.<br /><br />We don't usually eat bacon-- it's reserved for Thanksgiving and other such glutenous occasions. But if you enjoy food I really have to recommend giving this a try. If you are a bacon enthusiast, I insist.

review/summary: Blend it yourself is better!
review/text: Its great to be able to blend your own chicory coffee.  I use the fresh roasted Sumatra at Costco's with Community Coffee's chicory.  My blend is 8oz of chicory to 16oz of coffee.  If you want a stronger chicory favor, use more.  Use less for a milder blend.  The good thing about blending yourself is the ability to use a good grade of coffee.  I believe Cafe du Monde uses a low grade of coffee.<br /><br />If you don't need 6 bags of chicory, you can order it directly from Community Coffee.  Its $2.99 a bag, plus shipping (at least $6.95) from them.  Clearly Amazon is a better value.  I will usually end up giving a bag or 2 away to friends or family that express an interest.  Storing the rest in the freezer is a good idea.

Flavor and flexibility are a nice combination. The chicory itself is excellent--rich and bitter sweet--and the six twelve ounce bags deal is very affordable. Just store them in the freezer until you need them. I know I will be buying more.

review/summary: Read the title people...this is "100% Chicory."
review/text: First off, I'd just like to state that most of the negative reviews of this product are unwarranted. The title says that this is 100% Chicory, and that's exactly what you get. There is no coffee in the mix, just "100% Chicory" meant for blending with the coffee of your choice. This is reiterated in the product description. If you feel misled, then you didn't take the time to read either.<br /><br />Now, as for the product itself, Community Coffee Private Reserve Medium-Dark Roast, 100% Chicory (that's a mouthful), it's good. It's 100% chicory root, which you blend with whatever coffee you'd like. Each person is going to have their own preferences, so experimentation with your coffee-to-chicory ratio is key. I've blended it with a few Community Coffee coffee varieties, as well as several other, cheaper coffees, and I've found that a 3-to-1 ratio is best (my wife prefers 4-to-1 or higher, if she's going to use chicory at all). We use a French press, but a drip coffee-maker will work as well. Don't use anything for making espresso, such as a moka pot. I don't know this from personal experience, but apparently the chicory is much more water-soluble than coffee is, and it will really gum-up the smaller holes in those devices.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is a great product, especially at the Amazon Subscribe and Save price. At 6 bags per order, you'll probably want to share, as even after giving a couple of bags away, you're getting much more than if you bought it from Community Coffee directly (while they only charge $3 per bag, shipping kills it at around $7). Blending your own New Orleans-style coffee with chicory is a much more economical and better-tasting way to do it (brands like CDM are overpriced).

review/summary: A real taste pleaser
review/text: There is chicory and then there is Community Coffee Chicory.  I started using chicory with another company's mixed coffee and chicory product available in the Seattle area and learned to love the special flavor it gives to enhance my coffee.  When a friend went to visit her family who had just moved to Mississippi, she was nice enough to return with various bags of chicory so we could taste test all the ones the local grocery store had.  The winner was Community Coffee's chicory.  I have tried their coffee/chicory mix, and it's good too, but I like flavored ground coffee and playing with really dark roasts and medium roasts that are available up here, so buying just chicory works the best for me.  I've been buying Community Coffee for about 8-10 years and was pleasantly surprised to see it sold on Amazon.<br /><br />If you haven't tried chicory, take the chance and brew some up!  It's full of anti-oxidants, and has been known to help lower blood sugar with type 2 diabetes and help the liver work better.  Even tea drinkers can like chicory.  I also like that I don't need to put as much in the brew filter; it simply doesn't take as many grounds to brew.  If you've had chicory and found it to be bitter or have heard the 'bitter coffee' stories about it, keep that in mind.  If I am only brewing it without the coffee, I only put in 2 1/2 or 3 scoops instead of 4.<br /><br />Community Coffe Chicory and Amazon.com.  A prefect combination!  Try it today!<br /><br />(This is not paid for by Community Coffee or Amazon.  I really like them both!)

review/summary: WOW...and backwards...WOW:  makes a great cup 'o joe
review/text: Being from New Orleans, I love coffee with chicory.  As many know, using chicory is very common, perhaps due to the famous beignet shop, Cafe du Monde.  That coffee (with chicory) is awesome, and they do sell that premade blend here on Amazon.<br /><br />However, as other users have commented, the Cafe du Monde coffee doesn't use the best coffee beans...it's just a cheapo coffee bean that they happen to mix with chicory...which makes it unique.<br /><br />With this product, you can use whatever coffee bean you want, and then you mix in the chicory at whatever ratio suits you.  So you can use a cheapo coffee bean (folgers, maxwell house, etc.), or you can go with a better quality bean; the choice is yours since you are mixing these on your own.  For me, after the praising review, by consumer reports, of Eight O'Clock 100% columbian coffee, that's what I drink, and it's a GREAT coffee.  However, mixing in this chicory takes it to a whole new level!<br /><br />Finding the right ratio took some tweaking, but 2 to 1 (coffee to chicory) seems to work.  I use a french press and grind my coffee immediately before brewing.  For one cup, I use two spoons of freshly ground coffee and 1 spoon of chicory.  This makes a STRONG, but rich and smooth coffee.  As someone else mentioned, almost a chocolatey flavor.  It's just awesome.<br /><br />Finally, a comment on the negative reviews:<br />Unfortunately, the negative reviews were from people who didn't know they were purchasing 100% chicory and expected a coffee product instead.  Um, guys, gals, the listing clearly says "100% Chicory"; the fact that someone doesn't comprehend very clear words shouldn't result in a product getting a negative review.  Just my 1.5 cents.

review/text: I placed an order for three Community Coffee Private Reserve Ground Coffee, Medium-Dark Roast, 100% Chicory, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6), thinking it was coffee. When I first looked at the product description it said 100% coffee. But it's 100% chicory and I called Amazon to clarify their description. I like the taste of chicory blended into my coffee. I use half a table spoon for every three spoons of coffee. It has a unique but pleasant flavor, but you can't drink it straight. I am not blaming Amazon and giving it five stars because it is what it is, chicory that is a good buy and helps flavor my coffee. If your a chicory fan then this review is useless. But if you are like myself, remember this is not coffee.<br />I hope you find my review helpful.

review/text: The directions say to use 2 Tablespoons for every 6 oz cup.  If you do that, you will gag; this can't be drank at that strength (at least, not until you get used to it and if you really like it).  Two Tablespoons is actually a good starting point for an entire 12 cup pot!<br />The flavor does not really resemble coffee much.  However, if you are just looking for a black beverage that is hot, to drink when you are cold during the winter, this would fit the bill.  The flavor is not off-putting, provided you allow it to stand on it's own merit without comparing it with coffee.<br />Just remember, no more than 2 Tablespoons of grounds per POT to start with.

review/text: The flavor is very rich, but cripes is it potent.  You only use about 1/3 the quantity to get the same strength.  The flavor is somewhat like chocolate, not bitter at all.  Chicory is not coffee, hence no caffeine, which is either good or bad, depending on your preference.  Overall, I like the flavor, just be careful when you start to make it.  If you put in the same quantities as regular coffee, it will turn out like syrup.

review/summary: Chicory helped me kick that nasty caffeine habit.
review/text: I quit coffee and tea in late March.  I started out using chamomile or herbal tea as a substitute, but it just didn't offer the same bitter kick that coffee has.  Low and behold after watching a youtube video on coffee substitutes, I discovered chicory...jumped on Amazon and ordered it.  I used to drink my coffee black, so I tried the same thing with the chicory...okay, but it needed something else.  After a few days of experimentation, I finally distilled the final mix to about 80% chicory and 20% homemade almond milk.  It is really good.  I have to say it made giving up my old friend coffee doable.

review/summary: Chicory  Coffee
review/text: Community Coffee 100% chicory is a great deal for who like the New Orleans style coffee that is a mainstay in much of the South.  Our family always bought the popular brands of coffee and chicory mix.  With this product however, you are able to mix the chicory with your favorite coffee brand. This allows you to make the mix as strong or mild as you wish. It is also very reasonably priced.

review/summary: No, it's not coffee...
review/text: I remember having chicory tea as a young lad. It was made by soaking a chunk of chicory bark in a cup of hot water. I liked the flavor, but never made it a part of my regular day. Recently, I was reading about complimenting probiotics with a food group that contained "prebiotics." I was surprised to see that chicory was at the top of the list for desirable ingredients. I purchased this large quantity, hoping that it would all work out. Everyone will have their own mixture, but here is mine:<br /><br />1/2 Tablespoon chicory<br />1/2 Tablespoon coffee<br />1/8 Teaspoon cinnamon<br /><br />I brew into a cup through a Melita filter. I love the taste and enjoy a healthy cup every afternoon. I mix a larger batch with 1/2 cup chicory, 1/2 cup coffee, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon, using 1 tablespoon per brewed cup.

review/summary: Tastes like coffee if you use the right amount
review/text: This took a little trial and error for me to find the right amount.  The directions on the package recommend 1-2 tablespoons per cup as you would with regular coffee.  Way too much.  That is, if you want it to taste like coffee.  If you want it to taste like something bitter, sour, and unpleasant, then follow the directions.<br /><br />I brewed a batch using a tablespoon per cup and subsequently added so much water that I think the ratio is more like 1 teaspoon per cup.  I'll update w/ what I find.<br /><br />All that to say, this is a great alternative for those people who can't handle coffee.  With cream and stevia, and percolated with the 'right' amount of chicory, this tastes amazingly like coffee.<br /><br />My 'litmus test' is that when I add in my creamer, it develops a natural coffee color.  If it's dark, add more water, not creamer.<br /><br />Don't give up.  With everything there is a learning curve.

review/summary: If you enjoy the taste of chickory in your coffee, this is the way to go.
review/text: I enjoy the taste of chicory in my coffee. I 'used to' buy the fairly expensive Louisiana style coffee, with chicory, and mix that in with my favorite coffee. That worked but it was awkward and got to be expensive. This product is 100% roasted chicory. As the advertising says, it is a medium-dark roast. The Louisiana style coffees use a French roast (almost burnt) that does not appeal to all.<br /><br />I only wish that this product was sold in smaller quantities. I only use about a tablespoon of chicory per pot of coffee. The 'best if used by' date on the product I received was for six months into the future. There is no way I can see myself using up all six bags by then. It is still a very good value.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Ken

review/text: I first tasted chicory when we went to New Orleans for a visit in August.<br />I had been told I had to at least try it, but probably wouldn't care for it, as it was strong and a little bitter.<br />But I loved it, and when I got home, I ordered it online at Amazon... I now order it about every 3 months.  I now don't drink coffee(at home) without it.<br />If you haven't tried putting chicory in your coffee, you should.. you will be hooked like me.

It isn't coffee, but if you love chicory blends you might like chicory by itself.  I read a few reviews that were confused because it IS made by a company with coffee in the name.

review/summary: 100% Chicory.  This is NOT coffee or coffee blend.
review/text: Beware of the misnomer.  The label says "Community Coffee Private Reserve Ground COFFEE, Medium Roast, 100% Chicory".  However, the ingredients list reads: "100% chicory".  So if you end up using this product brewed straight, you'll end up with a 100% chicory brew, NOT coffee.<br /><br />If you are used to "Chicory coffee" (e.g., Cafe du Monde, etc.) you might think this is a similar product.  It is not.  This is 100% chicory, which you can use perfectly to blend with coffee to achieve your personalized cup of "chicory coffee".  Naturally, you can also brew chicory "straight", just like coffee, but the result is a bitter brew that tastes and smells woodsy like, well, chicory.  I use a 1:4 chicory to coffee ratio, but that's the beauty of this: you can use as much or as little of the chicory to blend to your liking.<br /><br />The advantages are that you can blend you own chicory to coffee grounds ratio, and also choose what type of coffee you want to use (decaf, organic, generic, premium, etc.)  You get the idea.<br /><br />Folks who do not want to bother with mixing their own blend can buy premixed chicory coffee such as Cafe du Monde and other brands that may be locally available.<br /><br />Verdict: The chicory is OK.  Use it to blend with coffee and you will be fine, unless you fancy straight chicory.

review/summary: No "coffee" in it and WAY too sweet!!
review/text: Bought this at a great price and Amazon did a fine job of getting it to me. I guess I wasn't a very informed consumer (my fault) because I was surprised when the ingredients on the bag had a sticker over it that just says "100% Chicory". So, there is absolutely NO COFFEE in it. I hate to be Mr. Precision here, but it really shouldn't be called coffee if there is none it. However, I suppose the same argument could be made for Soy "Milk". Anyhow, it is called Medium Dark Roast, and we were game since we did like the coffee at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans and do like dark, rich coffees. We made our first batch mixing 50% Chicory/ 50% Starbucks Bold Roast (our regular). We both could only make it through about 1.5 cups because, while smooth, it was way, WAY too sweet....like drinking Molasses. Today, we made 1/3 Chicory, 1/3 Bold Decaf Coffe, and 1/3 Bold Regular. Still way too sweet, and I have the chicory aftertaste still in my mouth. Unfortunately, using it at this rate (or less probably), it is going to take forever to get through all these bags.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing again and recommend you try a little first.

review/text: If you've never tried Kona coffee, Aloha Island is definitely the one to start with.  <p>Kona coffee is grown in the Kona district of the Big Island and regarded by some to be the best coffee in the world.  I'm not a coffee aficionado by any means, but you can taste the difference with Kona coffee - it's full and rich and almost mocha-ish.  I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).  Obviously, it gets more expensive as you go up the ladder.  The gold is very good and a great place to start sampling their fare.

review/text: The aroma from a pot of this coffee is earthy and heavenly at the same time. Everything about this product--packaging, texture, and taste--tells you that it was lovlngly produced under rigid standards. Moreover,if you've tried a lot of "kona" coffees like I have, you know how widely the taste and quality can vary. This is the coffee you serve to the treasured few in your life who really appreciate the finest.

review/summary: Smooth, but no bite
review/text: I can see why plenty of people will think this is the best coffee ever. It's some of the smoothest, least bitter coffee I've ever tasted. The aroma is also delicious. Opening the bag and taking a whiff right away is a must if you want to try this.<br /><br />But I'm the type of coffee drinker who loves it black, so I need a coffee with a rich flavour on its own. I don't wanter bitterness, but I love coffee with kick to it.<br /><br />I'd call it too mild but that's kind of oversimplifying it. It's worth a try to make up your own mind though.

review/summary: Inferior Coffee
review/text: Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price. I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage. I would never buy anything from Aloha Island Coffee company again.

review/summary: Not gross like most coffees
review/text: I'm more of a tea drinker but occasionally want something different and I like this to keep me up or wake me up too. So, keep in mind I haven't tasted lots of coffees. I find most coffees bitter and gross, like starbucks or whatever my mom buys. With some splenda I actually enjoy this, so even if you don't like coffee give this a try. It's definitely one of the better one.

review/summary: The best coffee!
review/text: This coffee is the absolute best.  I found it by accident a couple of months ago and now I can not have any other kind of coffee.  It may be more expensive than some, but well worth it.  Plus, you aren't going to want to go out to Starbucks anymore!  Manufacturer ships quickly too!

review/summary: these pods fit the senseo holder and it's great Coffee!!!
review/text: I'm not a fan of Senseo brand coffee pods so I've been using espresso pods from Green Mountain (not great but way better then senseo) for some reason they quit making them so I was searching for pods that fit the Senseo after reading the review I took a shot in the dark and ordered a box of them from Amazon and fell in Love I use them with the espresso pod holder I got from amazon (not the single pod holder that comes stock)and have been enjoying the best espresso I've had in years.  I liked them so well I just ordered 2 more boxes

review/summary: Take a moment for yourself.
review/text: You wake up early on a sunday morning and you turn on your other side because you want to sleep a little more. But then you smell something like scrambled eggs, fried oignon rings and above all the strong scent of espresso...<br /><br />This is strong coffee like the Italian espresso. Take care you don't boil the water, otherwise it will loses its flavor. The water should be between warm and hot. I use it black with a small lump of brown sugar. A real amateur will tell you that the use of any sugar is sacrilege. But what can I do? The flesh is weak.

review/summary: hands down better than the mass produced stuff.....
review/text: The difference between high fructose corn syrup and suger is that sugar tastes natural and your body knows its limits. With high fructose corn syrup the opposite is true, it taste synthetic and the after taste is designed to leave you wanting more and it actually causes some issues for people, now the reason I started my review with a comparison of HFCS vs sugar is because no where is it more evident than regular dr peper vs dublin dr pepper. Many of the reviewers have said that this is heaven and while I won't go that far I can tell you with a 4 person taste test this stuff destroys the regular formula out on the market. To tell you how I know its simple, the 4 person taste test team took a regular super market can of dr. pepper(they don't make it in glass anymore) each poured out a small sampling 2 fl ounces, and tasted, each of us had the same prognosis, its way to carbonated and the flavor bites at the tongue, its almost like the tongue and the soda is having a fight and the soda is winning, to continue the test we washed out our mouths with water and did the same with the cups, then after 5 minutes we did the same with the dublin dr pepper, never in my life have I tried this stuff and I can tell you that even though its an expensive habit the soda is satisfying, not only is it smooth its not overly sweet and it does not assault the tongue instead it tastes like how dr pepper should taste and I am converted... I probably should have also mentioned that until I tried ddp I hated the taste of dr pepper they converted me the only complaint is the company that sold it to me "thebargainbox" needs to take some lessons in packaging their shipments one of the bottles had broken during shipment and soaked the box in ddp, and it picked up the smells of the warehouse not pleasant. Continuing on everyone in the 4 person group fell in love with this soda and now are planning on picking it up sometime in the future. Instead of suing them snapple should be selling dublin dr. pepper in every freaking store this this stuff would put everyone else out of business.<br /><br />Now its time for the imnportant information, because I know as someone who is trying to watch his weight a little bit I pay attention to this stuff here are the details on the back of the bottle, serving size is 1 8oz bottle.<br />Calorie count: 100<br />Calories from fat: 0<br />Sodium count: 35mg<br />total carbs: 27g<br />Sugars: 27g<br />protein: 0<br /> ingredients: water,imperial pure cane sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, natural and artificial flavoring, sodium benozate(preservative), caffeine<br /><br />To be more specific this stuff is almost the same calorie count as the 7.5 ounce 90 calorie cans you can buy in any local food store with a much, much, much, much better taste.<br /><br />If you can force yourself to like regular dr pepper in the store then you absolutely must try dublin dr pepper its better for you and tastes incredible.

review/summary: Light, acidic, refreshing
review/text: This is a more typical "breakfast" blend, meaning lighter roast, lighter and brighter taste. The Central American and South America beans provide acidity and fragrance, the African provide a floral and grassy note.<br /><br />This isn't my favorite blend (I favor heavy Italian and French roasts) but it's nice in summer and it's really nice with ice. Though a breakfast blend, you can brew on "strong" and lower volume and brew it over ice. Black iced coffee, to me, is the perfect morning cup on my way to work if it's really hot out.
