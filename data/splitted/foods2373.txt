review/summary: Excellent Taste. Hot, But Not Too Hot.
review/text: When I order something simple in a Mexican restaurant (taco, burrito, etc.) I like to get a side order of "hot carrots" to go with it. They're delicious and supply veggies to go along with the main dish. Well, I always thought the restaurants made up the carrots themselves, but all of a sudden I was surprised to find you could buy big cans of them in a grocery store. This 26-ounce can of Embasa Carrots (in escabeche) is an example that I found in my local grocery store. Of course, I bought it. It's a good product. The carrots, onion and pepper strips are fully within the range of that which is served in Mexican restaurants. They're hot, but not unreasonably hot. The taste is excellent. This is a great discovery for me. I love these things and now I'll have a good home supply always available.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I've always had trouble getting my dogs to eat dry dog food.  I had ordered a small bag of the potato, chicken & blueberry just to keep on hand just in case.  Well, my dog got sick and would not eat his regular food.  We tried everything.  We opened the bag of First Mate, and he ate the whole bowl!  He's been eating it ever since, and I'm totally amazed.<br />It works!!!

She is allergic to the bulk of the ingredients found in most commercial dog foods sold in stores...beef, pork, corn, carrots, flax, oats...and the list goes on!  Thankfully this product showed up on the market!  She loves it and I don't have to worry about if what I am cooking for her (which I had to do for a while) has everything she needs in it!

Now she is starting to itch a little and we have had her allergy tested so we can see if she is developing any allergies to the ingredients in this food... then we may have to find a new one... otherwise, we will continue on it.  I don't know who that one person thinks they are calling this low quality organic, how the heck do they know what kind of quality it is?  I think they are a competitor.  Well, since anyone can say anything, I say First Mate is high quality premium dog food.

review/summary: First Mate is the first food to do it right!
review/text: As a pet enthusiast, I appreciate when a manufacturer cares about the animal and not just the profits.  First Mate has their own factory and sources their products from North America. They formulate their food to be holistic, basically, what the dog needs and nothing else.  Their food is balanced and not trendy like many of the high protein diets.  Best of all...my dogs eat it!  I cannot tell you how many times I have purchased high end foods that my dogs won't go near.

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: My dog loves this food and it has really cut back on the tear staining issues.  The staining was a big problem and I did quite a bit of research to find a solution. I considered a few products that you add to the dog food or come in pill form and several of these apparently  work however many of them are actually antibiotics I am not sure it is a good idea to use very often.  My research  led me to antioxidants (like blueberries) and avoiding wheat to cut back on the tear stains and give him a healthier coat. This food is not only grain free but is also loaded with blueberries.<br /><br />Yes, the first ingredient is potato however in FirstMate's defense, most companies include several non-protein ingredients so that they can put them lower down on the list thus making it look like there is more protein than anything else.  Also, meat "meal" is a much more concentrated protein than regular meat (somewhere in the range of 300% more concentrated).

review/summary: Tasty! Tea
review/text: Delicious chai tea.<br />This brand is my favorite, especially since it does not contain "natural flavors" like so many other teas contain.  I hate so called natural flavors and soy lecithen in my tea!  Love this brand because they don't junk it up.<br />Very nicely balanced blend, all the flavors Marry well together and no spice stands out.<br />No Stevia in this chai so I am able to determine the sweetness.  I don't like my tea very sweet so I only add milk.  The spice blend in this one is plenty sweet enough for me.  My children like a hint of honey.<br />Like that I get more spice for my buck;  no Stevia, no GM soy, no ?natural?flavors.  Only great taste.<br /><br />Update:<br />Tried Tazo chai tea and this brand blows it away, the right balance of spices!  This is stilll my favorite over celestial (yuck!) and other brands of bag chai.<br />Wish the product came in a recycled cardboard box so the price would less expensive.  The metal can feels wasteful and can be difficult to open.

review/summary: A Tremendously Tasty Tea
review/text: Since first having tried this tea several years ago, it has been one of my favourite teas by far. Having been a fan of Rooibos tea for many years, since my parents first brought some back from a trip to South Africa, and a fan of chai tea, finding out that there was such a thing as rooibos chai seemed the best of both worlds. I was not disappointed. I enjoy the delicate tang of citrus, and the subtle heat of the pepper that you can taste in the tea. It's all wonderfully balanced, and not overpowering at all.<br /><br />I like that it's naturally decaffeinated, it makes it a perfect tea to wind down the day with. Also, it allows my children to enjoy it too, and my almost-2-year-old gets very excited when I say I'm going to make tea, after which she'll start mooching from my cup.<br /><br />I've given tins of this tea away to friends and family, and all enjoy it immensely as well. I haven't met a tea lover who hasn't liked this tea.<br /><br />A perfect tea to cuddle up with along with a good book or movie, especially on a cold day or night.

I never got to making the lattes as I ran out drinking it straight!  Just opening the tin, you are enveloped in a soft cinnamon/clove/ginger-y goodness. After all the sachets were gone, I left the tin open to "perfume" my room!!<br /><br />Also, love that Gypsy teas come in tins. One, it keeps the tea fresher longer and out of the damaging sunlight and two, I can refill them with my various loose teas when I've run out of the sachets! (I've even seen a cookbook that wraps the tins in a decorative paper/label and fills them with trail mix for gifts!)

review/text: Zhena's Fireside Chai is the most amazing chai tea I've ever had (and I've tasted a number of different brands).  I fell in love with chai tea latte after having some really good cups at my favorite coffee shop.  And I started making my own chai tea latte, and I must say, the flavor with this tea is incredible.  The spice/sweet blend is perfect, delicate yet flavorful enough for the senses.  What I love about this tea is that the black pepper flavor isn't overpowering.  And when I add milk and honey, it's out of this world.  I enjoy drinking the tea as a breakfast (as it's filling when made into a latte), as a "snack" on a chilly day or night, or just as a nightcap to get me to relax.  The aroma while brewing the tea is equally intoxicating.  Delicious!  I give this tea my highest recommendation.

review/text: If you love Chai, you will love this tea.  I cannot get it anymore at my local grocery stores.  It is not too strong and not too weak - just right.  It comes in the round tea bags like Republic of Tea uses.  We have extra large cups that are the size of 2 coffee cups, and one tea bag is fine for the double cup.  Just let it rest a little bit longer.  Good with or without milk.  Have not tried it yet as iced tea, but plan to soon.  Since it is herbal, it is great before bed.

review/summary: Ugh... Not as good as expected
review/text: My wife has become a recent fan of Chai tea, so I looked for the highest rated Chai tea on Amazon and bought her a case for Christmas. Well, I simply can't agree with the other reviewers. This tea has a very weak flavor, and not nearly as tasty as the cheap grocery store tea she had grown to like. I am disappointed that we can't return it, because we won't drink it, and wasted almost $30.

review/summary: Pretty darn good
review/text: When I first got this one the venison I also bought the beef as well.<br />At first my cat ate it with no problem but then after a while he stopped eating it. Unknown reasons since when I bought my first round he would gobble it right up.<br />The food actually has a nice firm pate texture and the smell of the food is actually pretty nice. No stink at all like a lot of canned foods have.<br /><br />I like the fact that this food is grain free since grains are not digested in the cats systems.<br /><br />I still have a few cans left from my second purchase of this brand and I will eventually introduce it to him again.<br /><br />He seems to eat certain canned food stop will eat another brand and if I switch them around occasionally he will go back to eating the Evo.<br /><br />TJ is however a very picky eater so I always have to change things up from time to time.<br />Either way I give this food both thumbs up!!<br /><br />I recommend for first timers to buy little as possible the first time to make sure your cat/s is going to even like the change from canned foods that are consider "junk foods" to a canned food that is grain free and healthier and more beneficial towards their well being.<br /><br />Not all cats will like this food and as with any canned cat food every cat has a different personality and has different tastes.<br /><br />Will not hurt to try it out! If all else fails and your cat doesn't like the food remember there are adoption places with pets that are always accepting donated food to help feed the animals. :) It will never go to waste.<br /><br />Yes I will/do recommend this food to people!

review/summary: What do you mean you've never heard of White BBQ Sauce???
review/text: Only in the barbecue mecca of the known universe (Alabama, not Memphis) can you find a white sauce for barbecue. At Big Bob's in Decatur, if you order a half a chicken they will dip it in a big vat of this stuff before plating. Its fantastic, much better than any red sauce I've ever had on chicken.<br /><br />This stuff is great on chicken wings, fried catfish, baked potatoes, in chicken salad, and even works as a base for packaged dips. You can make white sauce at home but don't bother trying, you cant replicate this stuff. Also great on pulled pork sandwiches with slaw and red bbq sauce. They mix well together.<br /><br />Editorial on N.Alabama BBQ in the comments section.

review/summary: Simply The Best Commercial BBQ sauce
review/text: Over the decades that I have been cooking over live fire, I have used many different BBQ sauces, including some of my own. This one has been for some time the only commercial sauce I buy any more. It's medium thick and a bit spicy without excess heat. It's sweet with out excess. It's the definitive Kansas City, tomato based sauce and it compliments everything from pork to poultry. Careful online shopping will get a better price however, but the sauce is da bomb!<br /><br />I just realized that this review of the Gibson Championship Red Sauce had been moved to the white sauce. I did not review this product. It's good, mind, but the red BBQ sauce is superb!!

review/summary: Gibson's White Sauce is Unique... and delicious
review/text: Although I thought I knew it all about BBQ, I'd never heard of white BBQ sauce prior to reading The Big Bob Gibson's Barbecue book. I'm generally an adventurous eater, but the thought of chomping on a piece of chicken dripping white sauce just seemed strange. Until I tried it, that is. It's very hard to describe exactly what this sauce is like. You expect it to be like ranch dressing, but it's not even close. The blend of ingredients complements the smoky goodness of pit-cooked chicken perfectly, and in a completely different manner than a tomato-based sauce.

review/summary: Does not dry overnight; thick gel hard to apply evenly
review/text: Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make "ladybug spots and antennae," which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug "heads") very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.

review/summary: An English Classic
review/text: "Rich Tea" are the quintessential English tea-time biscuit, to be served mid-afternoon with a fine cup of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3WS7K">English Tea</a> (taken with milk, not lemon). And McVitie make the finest "Rich Tea", having exactly the correct texture and firmness and delicate flavour which these biscuits should have. "Rich Tea" are also the ultimate dunking biscuits, for which purposes they must, of course, be entirely whole and not cracked even in the slightest, otherwise they will instantly fall in half and disappear to the bottom of the cup. Even whole, these biscuits present the maximum challenge to the dunker -- leave the biscuit in the tea just a fraction of a second too long and, again, you'll wonder where your biscuit went (and why you have blotting paper at the bottom of your cup).  [American readers please note that dunking is, of course, entirely frowned upon in English high society, as an activity undertaken only by the peasant classes. It is thus to be indulged in only when entirely alone and in the privacy of one's own home, when there is no danger of being observed by the servants.]<br /><br />Should your biscuits arrive broken, as may, unfortunately, be all too likely (as these are a fragile biscuit and McVitie's packaging consists of no more than a paper wrapper) do not despair; all is not lost. Simply tip a quantity of the broken biscuits into a bowl and pour hot milk over them. The result may look like soggy blotting paper, but the eating experience is exquisite!

review/summary: A Natural Crunch
review/text: These Crunchy Treats come in sturdy, stand-up, plastic bag with tear off top. We find these resealable strip bags a nuisance to open and close so after opening all treats are kept in an easy open, airtight container. Wafting in the air after the grand opening was a heavenly apple aroma one might remember from when Grandma's baked her apple pies. If it weren't for the chicken fat and chicken meal in the recipe, I'd be tempted to munch on a treat or two myself and still might before this review is posted.<br /><br />There's a small, clear window on the front of the package, so one can preview these treats before buying. The tiny, tan colored biscuits are triangular shaped with a nail sized hole in the middle. For small dogs, they're easily broken in half, but most dogs should be able to handle them intact. Crunchy Treats do leave crumbs behind so be prepared for clean up unless your dog eats them whole, eats them over a plate, or is just a fastidiously neat eater.<br /><br />All three of our girls like these treats, though not as enthusiastically as they liked the dried apple slices we used to give them. I was actually a little disappointed by their subdued reactions. When placed within a selection of kibble and other assorted treats, the Crunchy Treats play second fiddle to anything with meat as the first ingredient. When only the Crunchy Treats are offered as snacks, all three of the girls take them readily.<br /><br />For our girls some treats are to die for, eliciting whines and drools of anticipation and antsy paws. Crunchy Treats don't get that kind of reaction so I'd suspect other treats we have on hand are better for training and bribery.<br /><br />Finally - These are a wonderful snack choice, with no wheat, wholesome ingredients, and no noxious chemicals. However they can't match the meat-based snacks like Cattlemen's Best Beef Recipe Treats or the little Zuke's salmon treats, for example.

review/text: Our dogs ABSOLUTELY LOVE these treats; all three flavors (apple, carrot, blueberry). They are an excellent size for training as well (not too large), and in addition to being made with healthier ingredients, they are very low in sodium and therefore much kinder to canine kidneys than the many low-quality super-salty treats on the market.<br /><br />Humans will be tempted to try tasting these treats too, as they smell as absolutely wonderful and tasty as human cookies - although my daughter tells me they taste somewhat blander to her than the delicious smell would suggest. Our dogs, however, for whom their sense of smell is most important, find them utterly delicious - and they are the ultimate critics whose taste-opinion matters.<br /><br />The packaging is also easy to open and re-seal. We highly recommend this brand of dog treats.

review/summary: Not worth the money
review/text: First let me say that my cats only like two flavors.  The tuna and salmon.  The ingredients are pretty good and seem nutritious.  One problem is the amount of water.  If you drain out the water, you're left with about a heaping tablespoon of food.  This is barely enough for one cat.  I have to supplement it with some dry food.  When I feed them something like Spa Select, it is so concentrated that I can give them half a can each.  So moneywise, I can give them the higher quality food for the same amount as the meow mix.<br />The second issue is the tiny bones.  I have to always look through the food before I give it to them.  When I wrote to the company they basically wrote back saying, hey stuff happens, here's a coupon.

review/text: I'm a big fan of white tea since it has less caffeine and more antioxidants than its green and black counterparts.  I am also a fan of peach flavored tea.  This peach-flavored white tea is my favorite tea, and it tastes great hot or cold.  When I make ice tea with it, I don't need any extra sugar (not that it's very sweet -- it just doesn't need it), which is great because it's not overpowered by sugar.  Another thing I like about it is that it only has a peach flavor.  Rishi makes a similar one called Peach Blossom that I also drink, but it has a mix of peach and jasmine flavors.  It's good hot, but I don't like its jasmine flavor when iced.

I'll admit we may let our tea steep a little longer than average but we've always done that and haven't noticed any changes in the tea.<br /><br />When we make ice tea, which is often seeing as how we live in the South, we use Lipton's Ice Tea blend in the larger bags instead of the smaller bags used here. My wife likes to compensate in advance for ice melting so she does make it strong.<br /><br />We have one opened box in our pantry and one unopened box in reserve. In addition to the regular black tea we also use Lipton's Green Tea and the Orange Spice for variety.<br /><br />All told we are happy with the Lipton products and have no plans to change.

review/summary: Difference, anyone?
review/text: I remember my dad giving a British friend of his a cup of tea made with Lipton 30 years ago.  To say in the least, dad's friend was a bit offended, and said, "Disgusting way to make tea!"  Back then, however, Lipton was the only brand to buy here in the U.S. worth having.  I've been served Lipton for 40+ years and have always enjoyed it, never having "real" tea until I traveled to England a few years ago.  Awesome stuff too, there really is no comparison I might add, and I now fully understand my dad's friend's complaint!<br /><br />Now to the question, I'm wondering if anyone else out there has noticed a significant difference in Lipton over the past 2 years.  It just does not seem to be as strong to me as it once was, and takes an unusually long time to brew compared to years past.  Its normal robust flavor has weakened, or so it seems, and it somewhat resembles a knock-off brand of tea instead of the Lipton we've come to expect.  When making iced tea, we now have to use 8 bags per gallon instead of the usual 6.  Honestly, I've started going to specialty tea shops in town to get Yorkshire tea, something I KNOW is served in England.  I've become that disappointed in Lipton over the years but in a pinch, it's still the only one I buy.  I can recommend it for children, if you will, but if you're expecting the Lipton we've always known, I'm afraid that you might have to start using 2 teabags per cup.

review/summary: Taste & Value
review/text: We exclusively drink iced tea all the time.  I make it from scratch with a Mr. Coffee iced tea maker and use the same amount of ingredients all the time.  I like to keep a good supply of these ingredients on hand in the event I can't get to the store.  Amazon is my way of doing this.  I can buy in bulk and have it delivered to my front door.  I am a diabetic and use Sugar Twin for my tea.  This is sometimes hard to find, but Amazon keeps me well supplied.  We love the taste of Lipton Tea and I don't use any other brand.  One thing I wish they would do:  make tagless tea bags so I won't have to do this before I make my tea.  Try Lipton, it's really good, hot or cold, and let Amazon supply it, as well as many other items!  If you buy enough, you won't have to pay for shipping either.

review/text: Lipton is my favorite cup of tea--except when my wife accidentally puts milk in it. Those British, you know, they like milk in their tea. Actually, she's Bajan, just outside of Speightstown.<br /><br />I would no sooner put milk in my tea than I would add tea to a glass of milk.<br /><br />My favorite recipe for a hot cup of Lipton: (1) sweeten as you like with 100% grade A pure maple syrup, (2) add a touch (or more) of Limoncello.<br /><br />Mmmm....

review/summary: Wonderful Stuff!
review/text: I have been using Giovanni Body Wash (White Tea scent) for several years now. I have extremely sensitive skin, prone to acne, rashes and irritations when using most other soaps. I have wasted tons of money trying soap after soap hoping to find something that wouldn't irritate my skin, lathering well, while leaving me feeling clean. This soap has a really nice, soft scent, washes skin clean of dirt and oil and leaves no soap scum after rinsed off. This is the only soap I have found that does not cause break-outs/irritations and lathers well. I truely wish I could find a more econonmcal product that does the same job as this body wash but still haven't found one. So I try to find really good deals when buying this body wash to help off set the cost.<br /><br />Please note: this soap is a little drying.. so if you already have a dry skin conidtion this may not be the soap for you. I lived in a very warm humid climate when I started using this soap and did not notice the drying effect until I moved to a much cooler and dryer area. With that being said Giovanni also sells one of the best moisturizers I have ever used, it's their body butter (comes in the same scents as the body washes). This body butter works fantasticly! I am in the health care field and have to wash my hands many, many times a day. If I put some of the body butter on at night right before I go to sleep, my hands are moisturized all the next day without reapplying! I have tried many moisturizers that seems to work great until you wash your hands, then its like you never had any on in the first place... the body butter is not like this.

review/summary: Where's the moisture?
review/text: Ok, so I absolutely love the packaging and the nifty description on the back of the bottle, but when I'm paying .64/oz, I expect it to moisturize. Giovanni claims that their washes include "essential oil complex to soothe, smooth and regenerate skin's lost moisture" but the ingredients' list contains no such ingredient, unless they are referring to the "Essential Oil Fragrance" in which case they are blatantly lying because essential oils provide scent, not moisture. Even the dollar bottles of cheapo wash at Walmart contain some type of moisturizer, albeit petroleum. Sometimes I use St. Ives Whipped Silk body wash and it's definitely more moisturizing than Giovanni due to the sunflower oil. I've noticed even JASON's washes contain Sodium PCA to moisturize (although their stuff also has harsh sulfates, so I've never tried them). Or maybe Giovanni deliberately left out any moisturizers out so that we buy their lotions/body butters. Ha!<br /><br />While I sound like I hate the product, I really don't; I just wish it provided some moisture. The good: it looks and feels like a spa product, washes well and rinses cleanly, and smells good and not artificial perfumey like Herbal Essences and all that other junk. Also, it actually works well as a shampoo when in a pinch. In fact, I've taken to using it as shampoo as well since Giovanni keeps changing their shampoo formulas (and for the worse, it seems, judging from the new ingredients) and body washes tend to be more gentle than shampoos. I've tried Raspberry Winter, Lavender Vanilla Snow, Cassifluer White Tea, and D:tox (bar soap form) and they all smell awesome. True aromatherapy in a bottle.

review/text: I'm so very lucky to have a Trader Joe's within driving distance and these are one of my favorite guilty pleasure snacks that I always purchase.  They are a jelly-like raspberry flavored stick covered with deep, dark chocolate.  They melt in your mouth and are simply divine.  You can eat four for a mere 150 calories which isn't too bad if you can stop yourself at four.  They contain a lot of sugar (of course) but no trans-fats or cholesterol.  If you enjoy decadent treats and strong flavors you can't go wrong with these but I noticed they're not a favorite of the kids (more for me!).

review/text: The product description says: "Keta Salmon Caviar is from the select roe of the Keta Salmon, which has very large eggs with a color that can range from bright red to brilliant orange."<br /><br />The caviar I received consisted of really small eggs (about half the size of those at a sushi restaurant) that are mushy, and taste awful. Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them. I had a "taste test" with my cat and dog, who *love* caviar) and they both turned their noses up at it. NOT a good sign.  :-(

review/text: This stuff was recommended to me by a friend and it's amazing. It tastes better than products I've tried from "organic" food stores. This stuff dissolves evenly in your hand without any lumps or fiber left over. Because of that it makes the best non petroleum based lotion I've ever seen. My wife uses it as an oil treatment for her hair and it works great for that. Most often we use it for cooking where it dissolves clean and does great for foods. The most fun is as a "personal lubricant" it is the only product that will not dry up or get sticky afterward, and it leaves your skin better off than when you started. There's a bunch more stuff if you look up it's website. I will say that everything I've tried it for has been a great success.

The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares, and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste. Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth. Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regard.<br />  At the very least try the Ghiradelli.

review/text: The treat size is about two times the size of the non-large breed treat.  The treat is recommended for dogs 50 pounds or larger.  Here's the "funny" part, the dosage is 1 treat per 10 pounds of weight.  Our dog is a Great Pyr, and is about 160 pounds.  That would be 16 pieces - about a half pouch.  We only give two treats at a time.<br /><br />I ordered the 8 count, and the first pouch of treats opened aren't soft, but they aren't hard either.  The other reviewer commented on the product being stale and hard.  I think the product, regardless of merchant, is a hardish product.  The first bag we received from our vet was about as hard as the ones received online.  Our dog doesn't care, he LOVES them.

review/text: The first time I had a Terry's Chocolate Orange was during Christmas, when our local "Superstore USA" stocked them.  I love chocolate.  And orange-flavored things are among my favorite flavors.  I never once imagined that combining the two flavors would yield one of my favorite desserts in the world!<br /><br />The folks in England got it right when they began to make Terry's Chocolate Oranges!  Buying these in bulk are totally worth the price you pay for them - they are meant to be savored.  One orange can last you a month if you really, really try - but they can also disappear in just a few hours, if you aren't careful!<br /><br />They might look like they're pretty delicate, but trust the label when you read "Whack and Unwrap!"  Take the ball in your hand and turn the orange so the bottom of it is facing downward, find a sturdy surface like a kitchen countertop, then raise the orange up high, and whack it down hard onto the flat surface.  You'll feel the individual "slices" form, and then you can unwrap, pick out a slice, and savor its delicacies!<br /><br />Buy them today, so this can remain a staple in Amazon's food store!  I don't want them to disappear anytime soon!  I'm going to order another case in a few weeks!<br />1,000,000,000,000,000 Stars, if possible!!!

I prefer milk chocolate over dark chocolate in general.<br /><br />The only problem with this chocolate is portion control. I have a hard time not eating the whole darn thing in a single day! LOL

review/summary: chocolate-y goodness
review/text: These can be hard to come by in the states. So when I saw amazon carried them I put an order in right away. They're extremely good, the mix of citrus and chocolate just right, and they couldn't be more fun. I took one into work recently and let some coworkers try some, they were all pleasantly surprised ny the goodness.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: I didn't purchase this product for myself, but it was important enough that I wanted to review anyway.<br />A family member of mine is undergoing weekly chemotherapy. Obviously that means nausea and vomiting. Around the time when he is undergoing chemo, this is basically all he wants to eat, and the only thing he can eat without making him feel worse.<br />He ran out recently and he couldn't find them in any stores in town. I immediately thought of Amazon. He had been rationing his last one when I ordered it, and it came the next day.<br />It sounds so silly, but this was such an important purchase and I'm so grateful that Amazon carried it, and Prime too! To be able to make this experience just *slightly* easier for him means so much. Thank you Amazon.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I love these things.  I used to get these at Christmas years ago when I dated someone whose parents were from England and I have carried on that tradition ever since!  I'm not a huge fan of orange flavored things, but I love these.  There's something about the mixture of chocolate and orange that is just amazing.<br /><br />I happened to catch this pack of 6 on sale directly from Amazon, not one of their third party suppliers, and it was only $20!  I don't know if it was a pricing mistake or what, but it was an amazing deal.

review/summary: Patience Is Key
review/text: I purchased a 6-pack straight from Amazon themselves last holiday season. One was supposed to be for myself while the rest for my friends so they could try them out as mini Christmas gifts. Though I tried to resist temptations, they all ended up in my belly instead - yes, they're THAT good.<br /><br />The chocolate comes in a foil wrapper, and the first thing you're supposed to do is smack it on a hard surface (the chocolate orange "slices" are initially stuck together, and you're encouraged to separate them by the aforementioned surface-hitting). I must say my skills at this aren't the best at this as I usually end up with a slightly smushed orange (on the area of impact) that isn't completely separated. Thankfully you can manually separate any leftover pieces pieces fairly easily after the smacking step (or you could just keep smacking until you're satisfied).<br /><br />One thing I don't understand is why Amazon doesn't keep them in stock all year round. If you have the patience, you can expect to get the best deal for your buck when they're (hopefully) in stock again this year.

review/summary: Glad the chocolate orange has a home at amazon
review/text: This is the original, not to be confused with the various cheaper knock offs that sometimes show up at CVS and other drug stores around the holidays. I miss the days when I could buy them at my grocery store, but so glad they've found a home here.<br />If you've never tried them don't be put off by the thought of mixing orange into your chocolate, it's just a hint of real orange oil, it's not overpowering at all. Very smooth, creamy chocolate.
