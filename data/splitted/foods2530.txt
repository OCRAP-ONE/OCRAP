review/summary: not bad, not great, but very solid
review/text: This isn't a bad tea, but it isn't very good either.<br /><br />The jasmine flavor and scent is very light and delicate and it adds just a hint of sweetness to the green tea without taking away from the flavor of the tea like Jasmine Pearls usually do. This is a smooth tea when brewed properly that drinks very easily and leaves one with a nice warm, refreshed, and relaxed feeling, when steeped too long it becomes very bitter though, so brew it carefully. It is mild enough to be drunk with meals fine, however, multiple infusions don't work with this tea very well at all.<br /><br />If you want a decent green tea with just a little hint of sweetness and floral aroma, then this is a great purchase. If you are looking for a tea with a strong jasmine flavor and a mighty strong aroma, then go for the jasmine pearls. The Jasmine Pearls by Numi are about twice the price (when you consider that you get 2 bags of Monky King for around the same price) but it holds up to multiple infusions much better (it still is only good for about 3 though).<br /><br />While a great every occassion kind of tea, I will not be moved away from the staple of Ti Kwaun Yin (Iron Goddess of Mercy) by Numi that is just perfect for my taste buds.

review/summary: I love a great cup of tea,
review/text: ESPECIALLY if it is a great cup of jasmine green tea!! I am a total tea lover and jasmine green tea made from loose tea leaves definitely has to be my favorite flavor of all time.<br /><br />So, I am always on the look out for the best, most flavorful jasmine green tea out there on the market. I just received this product on January 5th and have enjoyed drinking 4 cups of this tea daily the past 6 days!! This is the 1st time I've ever tried Numi's Monkey King, Jasmine Green Loose Leaf Tea and I love it. It smells very fragrantly and tastes wonderfully. This price of this product is great for what you receive (2 pounds) and I loved receiving free shipping by purchasing this product directly through Amazon.<br /><br />I'll be back to buy more of this product when I run out!!

review/summary: Quality is not good
review/text: I was disappointed to see all the little, broken tea "branches" inside. It seems like it's the scrap or leftovers of all the good leaves being picked out. I guess you get what you pay for. I will not buy this again. You will need to use a lot of it to make a good aromatic, strong tea. The tea does taste good but you need to use a lot. If you use a little bit, then there's no taste. I also bought the Numi Organic Jasmine Green Tea Pearl which cost more, but worth it. I would recommend you buy that.  Those tea leaves (pearls) are quality and just a few of them make a tasty, strong tea.

review/summary: Great Tea, Great Value
review/text: I'm fairly new to the world of tea.  I started drinking Dragonwell green tea a couple of years ago when my in-laws brought back some from China.  I started drinking more late last year when someone bought me a Perfect Tea maker from Teavana.  I bought Jasmine pearls at Teavana and found that I really like Jasmine green tea.  Now the teas at Teavana are pricey, good, but pricey.  I bought $30 worth of tea (Jasmine pearl is $12/2oz) and after 2 months, I'm completely out.  I can't compare loose leaf to Jasmine pearl but I can tell you that this tea from Numi comes close.  In fact, the fragrance and flavor are better than Teavana Jasmine pearl.  I love the smoothness of the flavor and the color of the tea when steeped.  The color resembles honey and I can't say I've had better jasmine tea...maybe except at dim sum in San Francisco.  I love this tea and at 2lbs.  I think it should last me for at least 6-8 months.

review/summary: Japanese Sensi style tea - Bleeech!
review/text: Most Americans, myself included, really dislike this kind of tea.  It is so different from the Ceylon/usual Chinese style of green tea, you wouldn't know it's the same plant.<br /><br />This brand is so powerful, that if I mix just 1/2 teaspoon with 5 Tablespoons of any other tea, the taste is still overpowering.  Plus your BM will be colored green.  The health effects of Japanese style green tea is supposed to be superior to other teas.<br /><br />This seems to be very high quality, but be sure that you actually like this style of tea (grassy taste).  The bags are very large.

review/summary: Dark Chocolate Taste. Chewy. Lots of Fiber. No Guilt Feelings.
review/text: I shop at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market for a lot of my evening meals. It's convenient and a lot of the meals are better than I can make. On the way to the check out, I pass by a large display of "healthy" candy items. Most of them might be called nutrition bars. I find them interesting and often select one for a dessert item with my meal. Last night's selection was The Good Bean fruit and chocolate bar using beans instead of the more conventional nuts. Roasted chick peas were a main ingredient. I just had to try it. Not bad. Dark chocolate taste. Chewy. Not very sweet. I felt as if I was consuming something healthy with a lot of fiber. No guilt feelings at all. Not bad, but not outstanding either.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Oh!  I think Chocolate Berry is now my favorite Good Bean Bar flavor.  I like them all but picked up a Chocolate Berry this morning at my local Peets Coffee as a snack before class. Yeah, that was good.  I like the combination crunchy-chewiness and the fact that they aren't super sweet.  The flavor is what comes through, not the sweetness.  Not as high in protein as some other bars but many of the bars high in protein have protein supplements which always taste bad to me.  I think the protein in this bar is all naturally occurring from the beans.  Bonus is that the chickpeas / garbanzo beans are also naturally high in fiber.

review/summary: A unique snack
review/text: I bought these to augment my low carb diet. Frankly, I am not fully comfortable with the idea of having most of my calories come from saturated fats derived  from red meat and bacon so I have been exploring alternatives such as avocados and fish. This product appealed to me because of the high omega 3, it's fish, and it's convenient. I bought both the original and peppered variety even though some reviewers cautioned they were inedible. Since I had to buy about 24 packets to make the shipping costs make sense I was somewhat nervous about this "gamble". I am pleased to say that they are a perfectly acceptable snack. My only objection is that they are quite high in sodium, an unavoidable by product of any jerky product. So I won't eat these every day, but they're good to have around for snacking 2 or 3 times a week. I prefer the peppered over the original.

review/summary: Excellent Source of Protein for Snacking
review/text: As a Certified Personal Trainer, I am always looking for products to recommend to my clients.  Of course, I would never recommend anything that I have not tried for myself FIRST.  Free range turkey jerky is an excellent choice for snacking, and Shelton's is by far the BEST TASTING! The flavor is not too spicy, but certainly not bland either.  The jerky's texture is very chewable, not leather-like.  Even my elderly clients can chew it. Being turkey, not beef, it saves you calories and fat.  It is a great source of (antibiotic-free) protein that does not make you feel bloated, so it perfect for snacking.  No need to worry about refrigeration after opening, so you can carry it in your gym bag and have the perfect post-workout protein snack.  I also recommend my clients keep it at work so they can avoid being tempted by the vending machines.  Amazon has it at a GREAT price!!

The little pieces are dry, bad tasting and look like they are reconstituted without any texture to them at all. I have been getting jerky from a place called Mountain America Jerky which recently raised their prices and so I am trying Amazon.com merchants. This jerky is really really bad. The other Amazon.com merchant I have tried for turkey jerky is Golden Valley which is much much better than this jerky. Don't get this stuff at all. It is really bad. Try the Golden Valley jerky also here at amazon. That at least has some decent flavor and you can tell it once was a turkey! This stuff is just awful.

review/text: My baby inhales this pouch - started feeding him this around 5-6 month. Mango & pear create a nice combination, delicate taste of sweet & just a little tart.<br />For an 8+ month old, the pouch lasts for one feeding (in addition to a more substantial food like oatmeal)

review/summary: The Go To Meal!
review/text: I don't review often but when I am satisfied with a product like this, well I just had to say how much I appreciate and love this product.  I have very picky eaters.  They don't eat ANYTHING new.  But, this product did the trick.  I've been feeding this to my now 13 month old since he was 5 months old.  He can't get through the day with at least one of these pouches.  I send (among other things) this pouch to daycare everyday.  At home he has it with some oatmeal and organic butter.  My toddler daughter also loves this.  She will take a pouch to pre-school and actually finish it every time she finds it in her lunchbox.  I even gave one to a co-worker who recently got braces as an adult and even she liked it!  She went out and bought some more at Target for the days she needs something to sustain her when her braces get tightened.  I can't recommend this enough.  I bought a single serving pouch at Target first to try it and once my kids were hooked I've been doing subscribe and save.  I also do subscribe and save with the pumpkin banana one...it's delicious!

review/summary: Great Baby Food - Need a Variety Pack
review/text: Our daughter loves all of the "squeezable" fruit varieties out there.  We prefer her to eat fresh fruit and veggies and make our own purees at home, but these (we call them) "squishers" are indispensable for snacks on the go - in the stroller or car.  Our only complaint in ordering them or buying them in bulk is that we wish there was some way to buy a VARIETY PACK.  I don't really want to buy a pack of 24 pear and mango only.  When I buy these in the store, I buy a wide assortment of flavors, fruits, veggies, and even brands.  Plum Organics could win us over for good if they offered a mixed pack that we could regularly order to keep us outfitted for zoo runs and play dates.  :)  Does anyone know of any such option out there?

review/summary: My kid loves these
review/text: My 15M old loves Plum Organics. The Pear & Mango is especially tasty. The 24 pack is a much better value that what you would spend a Wholefoods. My son wants to eat these all the time but I limit him to one a day. I prefer he eats fresh fruits and veggies still. Although, the Plum product is a good alternative especially if your out and about. Funny because he hated puree but he loves these. My one issue is that the Plum Organics is that sometimes he squeezes the package and the food squirts all over. It's a mess. I wish these was some way to protect against this because toddlers don't always practice the best control when it comes to food.

review/summary: Wholesome & delicious!
review/text: I try to give my little ones organic food whenever it's possible and when it's not too expensive. With that being said, Plum organics pear & mango is the perfect choice. It's not too pricey with the subscription and it tastes great!  Both my 4 yr old and 16 months old love it! My 16 months old has been eating this since he was about 9 months old. If my 16 months old doesn't finish it, I have the leftover. With other baby foods I bought to feed my baby, if he doesn't like it, I usually have to throw it out because I can't bear to eat it.<br />If your baby is a picky eater, give this a try. They find it fun to squirt it into their mouth instead of feeding them with a spoon. I usually give it to my kids when they take their bath because it may get messy.

review/text: Our almost 7 month old is in his 4th week of eating solids and he loves Plum Organics food! So far the Pear and Mango is his favorite flavor. We have also tried other flavors and he loves them all.<br /><br />The puree is very smooth, good gooey consistency (not too watery) and doesn't taste too sweet. These 2 fruits are a good blend - good color and smells good (like fresh fruit, no overriped yuckky smell!) We do not mix it with any milk or formula or cereal. He loves it as is, without any heating or chilling. He can eat the ENTIRE 4 over oz food in one go! Wow!

review/summary: Very different
review/text: I have ordered beans from Coffee Bean Direct in the past, and they have always arrived well-roasted and fresh.  I am very satisfied with the company's other coffees.  However...<br /><br />These Sumatra beans are noticeably earthier than the Sumatra beans I'm used to getting from my local roasters.  In fact, the "earthiness" is all I can taste.  There really is no other flavor involved.  I expect Sumatra beans to be mild, but these beans take it to a whole new level.<br /><br />I was able to salvage this bag by blending in about 25% of CBD's Dark Sumatra beans, but even that still doesn't make a satisfying mug of coffee.<br /><br />The two stars are for the speedy delivery (even on Super Saver) and packaging, but order a one-pound bag before getting this fiver.

review/summary: It smelled nice....
review/text: Firstly, I prefer my beans roasted slightly darker, this is very much a blonde roast.  But I could possibly re-roast these beans, however:<br /><br />My favorite coffee of all time was something sold by Starbucks called Komodo Dragon, and other coffees like it by Starbucks.  It is missing a bitterness I associate with acid in coffee, a bite that, in its absense, allows you to taste the coffee. The lack of that distracting bitterness leaves the coffee with overtones of chocolate and berries and, well, all of the good flavors of coffee.  I would drink the coffee hot, but more often cool, unsweetened, unflavored, since I found I could taste it much better when it was cool.<br /><br />A few years ago, Starbucks changed their coffee from "Komodo Dragon" to "Komodo Dragon Blend".  It was still very close in flavor to the original coffee, which I think was all from a limited area.<br /><br />But now it no longer has a good flavor.  It has that bitterness that used to be missing from most Indonesian Coffees and specifically Komodo Dragon and Blend.<br /><br />So I went off to try and find another decent coffee, something low acid, not bitter, and able to feed my five pound a month habit.<br /><br />This coffee was labeled as a "very low acid coffee". I had hope for it. I bought the smallest quantity I could see available, which was a five pound bag.<br /><br />This is not the coffee that will replace Komodo Dragon - it is not even close.  It is bitter, has the flavor of a central american washed coffee.  If that is a flavor you like, you might like this coffee.  Me?  I'm not going to buy another bag, and I will probably make 2-3 pots to see if I can stand drinking it at all-I am very close to declaring it undrinkable and returning it..I want to make sure that I am only tasting this coffee - I cleaned the grinder and all that but I will make at least one more pot to be sure I don't have any of the fail Komodo Dragon Blend in the pathway.  If that comes out as bad as this pot I will likely return it - or give it to a neighbor or some such.  Or drink it with some hazelnut syrup or even cardamom to mask the bitterness.  Because it is not that low acid, unbitter coffee that Komodo Dragon Blend used to be.<br /><br />And that is too bad.

review/text: I was worried that 70% dark chocolate meant very bitter. I was totally wrong. What I found was smooth and sophisticated. A "grown-up" chocolate. The sweetness is very light but just right. Nibble it or just place it on your tongue and let it melt- either way is great.  I sometimes have just one small square and that satisfies my sweet craving. I refuse to spend my money on other brands now.

review/summary: My Favorite Chocolate Bar
review/text: I've been buying these bars, singly, for years and years at the grocery store.  They were out of the black ones, for some reason, so I finally ordered an entire box.<br /><br />This is my favorite chocolate.  It's nice and dark and flavorful without being bitter or waxy.  It is the only bar of this richness that I have tried that melts well on the tongue.  Everything else this dark seems to just chip, which isn't any good.  Chocolove makes the winningest chocolate that I've tried, and their black bar is my old standby.<br /><br />The gold bar has good flavor, but doesn't melt well.  Some of the flavored bars are good.  The best is the peppermint (blue).  My other favorite is the ginger (green).  Can you tell I prefer dark to milk?<br /><br />If you're interested, it turns out you can send any of these chocolate bars through the mail with only a "forever" and a postcard stamp.  They were my valentines this year, wrapped up in colorful paper.  These are particularly appropriate for valentines because there is always a love poem on the inside of the paper. I tend to skip the poem and go straight for the treat.  Yum!

review/summary: Chocolove Premium Chocolate Bars, Belgian Chocolate, Strong Dark (70%)
review/text: I love many of the chocolove bars, they are all wonderful and full of flavor.  This one is a very simple suttle dark chocolate, not too strong but not lacking in flavor either. If you are a fan of dark chocolate I would give this one a try, its very smooth and coats the mouth in a wonderful soft dark chocolate.  Not sickly sweet at all, but just a touch of sweetness.  The cocoa flavor is perfect here.  Its not my most favorite dark chocolate but it is a nice treat to have to change things up a bit.

review/summary: No Love From Chocolove
review/text: While the chocolates from Chocolove may be tasty, their treatment of folks they do business with is anything but. I shop and support small business because I believe them to be responsible to other small businesses they work with. When the management of Chocolove refused to pay for work done for them by friends of mine (also in Boulder), I can no longer buy their chocolate. There are many other small chocolate companies around and from now on my money will go to folks who do the right thing.

review/text: If you are purchasing a box of Norman Love "chocolates" because they are pretty and artistic, you will probably get a box of creams.  They are NOT chocolates.  They have a thin candy coating that has a far-distant vague taste of chocolate, but it is overcome by the fruity cream in the middle. They may sell chocolate "bars" but I will never find out because their customer service is hateful and demeaning.  If you want a REAL artisan chocolate experience, order Christopher Elbow instead.

review/text: I just bought the toffee and almond bar.  It was the worst chocolate I've ever eaten in my life.  It tasted waxy.  The toffee was basically non-existent. I searched the bar for almonds and found a couple of tiny pieces.  I threw it away after only eating 2 small squares.  What a waste of money.  And my taste buds are very disappointed.  Maybe the dark chocolate is better but I definitely do not recommend this one.

I can't say weather the low acid claim is valid but they sure have the low flavor perfected. Don't waste your money. Not worth the money and effort to return it.  Joe in Oregon

review/text: I agree with all of the other reviewers...this stuff is really good for what it is - a cocoa granola.  It has a great cocoa taste (I wouldn't describe the taste as chocolate, really, although it has 63% chocolate chips in it as well), and is sweet enough without being too sweet.  And, as far as granola is concerned, it is really healthy...only 35mg sodium, 1g saturated fat, 8g sugar.  The only minor issue I have is that I like my granola "clustered" a little more...you know, little granola bunches.  It has "Clusters" in the title, but I am not sure it actually comes that way.  However, my shipment seemed to get crushed enroute, so...

review/summary: WOW! Huge Chocolate Flavor, Not too Sweet, Perfect!
review/text: I tried this chocolate flavor after having already tasted the other flavors that Love Grown makes (and loving them).<br /><br />This chocolate one has slightly more sugar than the other flavors, so I was worried maybe it would be too sweet. I was wrong, it's perfectly balanced. Love Grown managed to get the perfect balance of bold chocolate flavor, that wonderful hit of bitterness form the cocoa, and just the right amount of sweetness.<br /><br />This stuff is super yummy and is a treat with milk, with yogurt, or just plan by itself dry as a snack.<br /><br />I have tasted at least a dozen other brands of healthy granola recently and Love Grown is without a doubt the best tasting brand I have found. As it happens it is also probably one of the healthiest.<br /><br />If you are a fan of dark chocolate and you don't like things that are too sweet, you will be amazed how well balanced and delicious this granola is.

These Plato organic strips were my next test before making my own - and one bag of each flavor was cheaper than the Chinese jerky I purchased!  We haven't received the salmon flavor yet but my dog seems to like both the chicken and duck flavors very much.  I was a little surprised at the product itself, given it is called a "strip," but looks more like a cookie than anything else.  Still, it's nice to find something made in the USA, with no corn, soy, or wheat gluten.  I will continue to buy these if my dog continues to eat them.

review/summary: Great Treat, Alternative of Chicken Jerky
review/text: I used to feed my then two month old puppy chicken jerky treats from Sams. It was cheap and he LOVED it. However, he started getting bloody diarrhea. This happened twice before I finally realized it was the jerky by researching this online. Since my puppy was also eating Greenies, Zuke's chicken treats, Milk Bones, Milk Bones Trail Mix, Iams Puppy dog food, Royal Canin food (digestion formula), puppy vitamins, Platos chicken treats, Natures Recipe food and treats, his puppy trainer's treats, and Benadryl (he has dermatitis), it was hard to pinpoint what the cause was. But once I figured it out, I stopped the Waggin Train and switched to Platos. Although these treats are more expensive and contain preservatives, it does seem a better alternative to liver failure or sudden death some pet owners were experiencing with chicken jerky treats.<br /><br />As for the seemingly biased reviews against jerky treats coming from China, I am a first generation Chinese immigrant with family back East, and I love them and where I am from, but shady practices are abound in China. So no xenophobia driven bias here, I have seen the damage done to my pup by Chinese treats, and these Platos treats are definitely a safer bet.<br /><br />The FDA statement regarding Chinese chicken treats can be found here:<br />[...]

review/summary: Made in USA and the new favorite treat!
review/text: I too am boycotting dog chews and treats not made in the US, so was nervous about ordering these.  Amazon needs to be very specific about this info in its descriptions, and not dance around the issue by leaving it out.  Country of origin should not be "optional" in terms of the descriptive information provided!<br /><br />That being said, these are a huge hit with our big guys.  They are a crunchy bisquit - not jerky - about 1 1/2" long by maybe 3/4" wide, but the first ingredient is organic chicken (package specifies "over 90% organic chicken"), followed by organic brown rice; the product is certified USDA Organic.  [I am of the camp that "organic" means anything containing a carbon atom, and that aspect is not a big selling point for ME, but may be desirable info for some.]  They are not inexpensive, but for a product made in the US AND mostly chicken, I think it's in line with other pet treats, or less.  I use them in combination with other, more grain-containing treats, since TOO much protein can put a lot of strain on the kidneys, especially in older dogs.<br /><br />Bottom line - great product...this doggy Mom approves!
