review/summary: Trix says this one is a keeper~
review/text: My cat Trixie loves snacks of any kind-anything that is not the dry crunchy kibble that is in her bowl so the idea of giving her a treat that would also help keep tartar at bay seemed like a win-win.  Though she had been eating "Pounce" as her treat which is soft, she went for it and then after eating about eight of them just sat and looked at me like, "hel-lo", shake out a few more and stop being so stingy".  So I did, and then zipped the little pouch closed-two steps behind me there she was again, so I can only glean from this that this would be a five star rating.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever tried to brush a cat's teeth (we tried this ONCE  when our obviously sadistic vet suggested it)will enjoy just throwing a few treats out and letting their cat crunch that tartar right off.<br /><br />I would definitely look at purchasing this item for Trixie again.

review/summary: My cats enjoy them!
review/text: My two cats definitely give these treats "two paws up"! After I shook out a few of these treats for my cats (and they were promptly gobbled up), I set the package on top of a bookshelf and left the room. When I returned, I found one of my cats balancing on top of the bookshelf, trying to chew through the package! So they must be pretty tasty. Plus, one of my cats has a *very* sensitive stomach and most treats come up as promptly as they go down; these stayed in, thank goodness!<br /><br />Head over to hartzcrunchnclean dot com for nutritional info and coupons.<br /><br />I think the price is a bit high, but I can see myself purchasing these for my two cats in the future since they enjoy them so much.

review/summary: One cat tried to bury them.
review/text: Normally, my cats all love crunchy treats. I've seen them try to chew into the packs to get to the treats. I have 3 cats, a 13 year old male, a 1 year old male, and a 1 year old female.<br /><br />I gave them all some of these treats. The two males ate three pieces each and left the rest. Well, actually, the younger male tried to bury the ones that were left, making the same motions he does in the litter box. The female ate five pieces and then was done; she would not touch the others' leftovers.<br /><br />I have never in my life seen any cats walk away from treats like these. And since the recommended amount for teeth cleaning is 5 pieces twice a day, these obviously are not going to work even if the cats could be persuaded to try them again, if three is all they can stand.<br /><br />Looking at how the cats were chewing them, I might guess that these were _too_ crunchy for them to enjoy. But that wouldn't explain why the one cat thought the treats should be buried.

review/text: As far as taste goes, they all come running when they hear me opening the package.  I can't vouch for the teeth cleaning properties, as it appeared to me they were mostly swallowing them after a couple of bites.  I keep snacks to a minimum to prevent obesity.  What we need is a flavorful chew for cats they could mouth real well.  I have a couple that would chew them, cleaning their teeth without a lot of calories.

review/summary: Meow!!
review/text: I recently tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q9EGFY">Hartz Crunch n Clean 3-Ounce Cat Treat, Salmon</a> and they were a big success, so I thought I'd give the chicken flavor a try, while Kitty didn't seem quite as excited about this flavor, I would still have to consider them a success.<br />As for the tarter control aspect of the treats, I really couldn't say that they work either way. Perhaps some people have an intimate enough relationship with their cats to be able to tell if a specific treat is reducing tarter or otherwise protecting their teeth, I'm not one of those people. But, the worse case scenario is that her teeth are in the same condition before the treats as they are after, as I would be really surprised if they made her tarter problem worse, so I'll continue to feed her the tarter control treats. Maybe her teeth will be a little cleaner when she bites me in an attempt to convince me to give her more treats.

review/summary: One of the few "teeth cleaning treats" that my cat will eat.
review/text: Cats are a finicky bunch, mine in particular. On the plus side she isn't interested in people food, on the not-so-plus side she turns her nose up to almost everything I buy for her to eat. With that in mind it was a small miracle when she actually ate these the first time I gave them to her and then looked up and asked for more. I can't comment on how well they work on keeping her teeth clean but I can say if they do work as advertised I'm more than pleased with the product.  I have tried those other products and my cat has no interest in them. I will buying more of these.

review/summary: No interest from one usually quite interested in food
review/text: Banjo review (by proxy): I give it two sniffs. I ate the first couple, but ate around the next few in my dish. When offered this "treat" a third time, I licked them but found Mousie-mouse-mouse MUCH more interesting.<br /><br />Proxy's review: There are a LOT of treats in the pouch. If your cat likes them, this is a good thing. If they actually do work as a "dental shield" as the package says they will...that's a good thing too. Banjo was not interested. He much prefers the "tastations" and "whiskas" treats. I also thought that the treats are on the small side--which leads larger cats who, um...might be hogs...to NOT chew them at all thus defeating the whole purpose of the "dental shield"<br /><br />SO two stars. Other cats might like these, Banjo did not. (He's a 13 lb. Mainecoon & Tabby mix who is 8 years old and an active healthy eater)

review/summary: If your cat likes treats....
review/text: I have two cats and on occasion like to give them a treat. This is partly because I like my cats, and also to give them some variety in their diet. I have one cat who will eat anything, and will gobble any treat. She loved these treats and quickly gobbled them down - and I had to hold her off from eating her "sister's" treats as well. My other cat, while not a finicky eater, just is not as motivated by food. So for her, there is not a treat that she likes. This one was the same, and her buddy got to eat them all. These are supposedly better for their teeth but hard to evaluate such a claim on a personal basis. To get the maximum benefit, you are are supposed to feed them these 4-5 treats TWICE daily! I suppose the claim might work (the special ingredient was developed at the Indiana University Dental School), but these are certainly costly cat treats!!! I mark them down, because my one cat will eat anything, they are very costly, and my cat who is not into treats is not into these either. I do mark them quite high for being potentially useful for preventing dental problems, being low calorie, and in that sense, quite different from most cat treats.

review/summary: Little nuggets of intense flavor!
review/text: As far as flavor goes, these treats get A++!  My cats are crazy about them...and my dogs beg (unsuccessfully) for them. For some reason, I was expecting a much bigger "biscuit," but these treats are very tiny and thin--a bit smaller than most cat food pieces.  I like the resealable package.<br /><br />I have a 19 year old (very healthy and active) cat and one that is 7.  Both eat them quickly and earnestly, but I noticed that both of them just swallow most of the nuggets.  That's certainly not helping their teeth (and the reason I only gave 4 stars), but I suppose they will get the vitamin benefit from them.  It strikes me that maybe these treats should be just a bit larger, so cats would have to bite them in half and chew before swallowing...but, of course, they should not so big that there would be a danger of choking.<br /><br />As my cats love the taste so much, and because of the vitamin content, I will most likely buy them again.  But I hope they are reformulated to be larger in size.

review/summary: Both the old and the bold at my house love them
review/text: I wasn't sure exactly how to review cat treats--since I don't have any frame of reference--never having eaten them before. Just kidding.<br /><br />So I have one 17 year old cat who throws up everything and another 7 year old cat that is extremely picky when it comes to anything other than her normal brand of cat food. I was going for the concept that they would eat them and I wouldn't find any surprises on my bed when I got home from work.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough they both loved them (this is rare--they don't even like the same cat food!). I didn't step on any squishy disgusting things (well, except a couple of soggy toasted oat cereal--but that's not my cats--that's my kid).<br /><br />I don't see this replacing regular dental hygiene or vets visits (too bad) but they are a paws up winner at our house!

review/summary: Excellent and does clean the teeth!
review/text: Before giving these treats to my cat Felix, I wanted to make sure to include a vet's opinion of this product in my review. So, I scheduled an appointment and took Felix and the treats in. Upon inspection of the bag, my vet (Sally Foote) looked closely at the dietary information.<br /><br />Table:<br /><br />Crude Protein:  25%<br />Crude Fat:  08%<br />Crude Fiber:  04%<br />Moisture:  10%<br />Vitamin A:  2,273 IU/lb<br />Vitamin B:  14 IU/lb<br />Zinc  75 mg/kg<br />Taurin:  0.1%<br /><br />While the vet said that the Crude Fat content was a tad higher than she would like to see, the fact that it only had 1.1 calories per treat is very favorable in her opinion.The dental cleaning is a plus and my vet did compliment the product on having that but she also stated that if you are trying to do away with daily brushing, your kitty would have to eat alot of these treats.<br /><br />Now came the real test: Felix himself. When I placed one small treat in my hand and presented it to him, he was hesitant. Sniffing it, he wasn't sure if he should try it or not. At first glance, I would say he hated it but decided to try again when he wasn't distracted by anything. So, after his nap, I presented the treat to him again and this time, he eagerly cleaned it up and wanted more. I ended up feeding him 5 treats and he still wanted more.<br /><br />This morning I found the package that WAS on top of my refridgerator, ripped up and emptied on the floor. I assume he loves them! I'm gonna have to buy more.

review/summary: 3 Stars - I Guess??
review/text: I'm not really sure how to review a cat treat.  I assume my only course of action is to describe how my cat, Cleo, reacted to these new treats.  I should say first of all that Cleo is used to eating moist treats and hard food - she may have just associated this crunchy treat as a pebble of her food.<br /><br />Treat 1 - She ate it.  Cleo is a very tiny cat with tiny teeth (I usually have to find food that has very small pieces in order for her to eat it) and I noticed that she had a hard time chewing this crunchy treat.<br /><br />Treat 2 - Sniffed at it and licked it.  No eating.<br /><br />Treat 3 - Wouldn't go near it.  I picked it up and put it in her food bowl. And I noticed this morning that the treat was removed from her food bowl and kicked aside so that Cleo could eat her food.<br /><br />I gave this treat 3 stars because I like the idea of the green core that cleans the teeth - although, that green core is very hard. All in all, I'd say that my cat hated these.  But, she's a picky kitty.

review/summary: Cruchy treat for my feline family friends
review/text: We have 3 cats.  We have had cats for 26 years.  We have gone thru lots of different types of treats.  These seem OK.  Our youngest (2) liked them the most.  The middle cat (9) thought they were worth eating sorta....i.e. she could take 'em or leave 'em.  The old lady (12) thought they were good.  She doesn't usually like new things so it was a nice treat for her.  Overall, it seems to be a good treat.  I don't know about the 'cleaning of the teeth' thing, but all of my cats ate the treats. Hope this helps.

review/text: ...if she could get her head out of this bag of Crunch n Clean! Seriously, she is crazy about them...and they are low in calories [1.1 cal per treat...she could stand to lose a pound or so] and high in protein [25% min]. Got it in the beef flavor as well, just as popular. The 3 0z. bag contains quite a few of the pieces [it doesn't say how many on the package, but I'd guess over a 100].<br />I can't speak for the tooth care, but her teeth are pretty healthy anyway since her primary food is dry kibble...crunchy as well!<br />I left off a star because they used artificial food coloring, which I try to avoid...it is unnecessary [while cats supposedly can see colors, they apparently have trouble with red, and are better with blue/green...and they don't appear to care as much about color as we do...so the coloring is for the owners, I gather].<br />Note: The chicken has titanium dioxide [white] and blue #1, while the beef has them as well as red #40, yellow #5 and blue #2.<br />Now, if they would offer one that was all natural, I would give it 5 stars!<br />Efit: 7/17/09...still lovin' these treats...I have even been able to train my cat to sit...although, cynics in our household claim that she is sitting anyway to get ready for the treat!

review/summary: A hit with the cats
review/text: All four of my cats loved Hartz Crunch and Clean - chicken flavor.  All of them were complaining loudly when I opened the resealable pouch. They wanted their treats immediately!<br /><br />The suggested serving for maximum dental benefits is four or five crunchies twice daily. Since each crunchy is only 1.1 calorie, I don't need to be overly concerned about these treats leading to my cat's obesity.  Cats need to consume about 30 calories daily for each pound they weigh.  The ideal daily serving size of 10 treats would amount to an eight pound cat receiving around 5 percent of its calories from Hartz Crunch 'n Clean.<br /><br />I have no idea whether or not Hartz Crunch and clean removes 3 times more tartar (3 times as much as what?) as the front of the product advertises.  However since my cats loved the treat so much, I give this product 5 stars.

Therefore, I'd say it's a decent value as well.<br /><br />It's also a treat for my daughter to give these to the cats.

review/summary: Half the team approves - HIGHLY APPROVES
review/text: It started with a look.  Them asleep in their beds, me dropping a treat on the floor near them.  Their heads shifted slightly to size me up (without moving their perfectly folded bodies of course) - Dad kneeling near their beds?  A mouse scurrying across the floor that must be stopped immediately before it reaches its destination?  A toy?<br /><br />Once my presence was established their attention shifted to floor and small brown nugget laying close to their beds.  Alex, who's ALWAYS hungry and eats anything I put before him, favored his bed to the morsel and only considered leaving it to perhaps rub against my leg - a favored past-time second only to eating.  Lewis, the more timid, more picky, and generally more cautious (after 6 years I still don't think he's yet convinced I'm not trying to kill him) crawled slowly from his nest to inspect.<br /><br />There was a sniff...  maybe two.  And then I couldn't believe my eyes when he actually ate the treat. He's since had more and has learned what to expect when I pull the bag from it's spot in the pantry.  A frenzy complete with mouthy remarks ensues.<br /><br />Technical details:  The treats look and feel like most other cat treats we've tried.  They're crunchy (vs. chewy as the title suggests) and bite sized (perhaps the size of a pea but flat).  I haven't noticed a difference in their oral hygiene at all but neither cat has any teeth or gum problems.  The pouch itself is easily resealable for later use of course.<br /><br />I hope to post a video of this soon!

I had been giving my cats these treats for maybe 3 or 4 days, and then it was time for their annual check-up at the vet. He was very impressed with how their teeth looked, and my cats are both 10 years old. So I highly recommend getting these treats!

review/summary: its not even garlic oil
review/text: Its an outright lie that this product is garlic oil.  It is garlic flavored soybean oil an its simply outrageous that they have the gall to market it as garlic oil.  If I wanted oil from gene modified soybeans I could run down to Dollar General and get a lot larger bottle for $1.  Of course I'd have to crush a garlic clove or 2 to flavor it, but at least I'd know that it was actual garlic in it rather than the "garlic extracts" that Roland uses to flavor their soybean oil.  This product stinks, and I don't mean of garlic.  Amazon should not even allow this fraudulently labeled product to be distributed through under their banner, but at the very least one ought to be able to put a minus sign into the rating so I could give it a minus 5 stars.

review/text: Excellent product BUT you'd have to be nuts to pay Amazon's price! A 9.9 oz bag in most stores is $3.19. Amazon is charging $27.99 PLUS S&H for a product that you could buy for $9.57. As much as I love the salty/sweet combination, it just isn't worth paying more than 3 times the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price.

review/summary: THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA
review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: VERY GOOD TASTING "REAL BREWER'S YEAST" -- NOTHING ADDED<br /><br />This "Genuine Brewer's Yeast" powder tastes very good for real Brewers Yeast. Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

review/summary: B Vitamin Bonanza
review/text: I first encountered brewers yeast when pregnant.  It kept coming up again and again as the perfect food based nutritional additive.  Since it is food based and not a suppliment, it is easily absorbed.  However, it is known for its unpleasent taste.  A serving is two heaping tablespoons, and at first I could not find something to mix it in that I liked well enough, so I gave up on it temporarily.  It kept coming up in my researches for a healthy pregnancy, and so returned to it and it has remained part of my daily routine.  The mix I found I like quite well is the two heaping tablespoons mixed into about 5oz of Pom pomagranite juice.  This mixture is actually quite pleasent.<br /><br />I have tried a few different brands, and I am fond of Twinlab for the more palitable taste and the balance of the B vitamins.  The "subscribe and save" deal on Amazon puts it at a very good price.

They like the taste of the yeast and regard it as a special treat. The yeast provides them with extra B vitamins.<br /><br />One of the vitamins in the yeast is vitamin B1, thiamine. Many people believe that thiamine repels fleas. This has not been proved. However, since the cats like the yeast, they get in on their food. One 18 ounce bottle seems to last forever. Also, they do not have fleas.

I haven't tried sprinkling it directly on food but I have enjoyed adding it to my shakes and the flavors it imparts. A blender helps when adding to liquids as it seems to mix about as well as powdered cocoa.

review/summary: Good taste, bad solubility
review/text: I started taking brewers yeast because the large amount of chromium in it is supposed to be very good for your skin, especially if it's acne prone. I've been taking it since the end of January and my skin still breaks out a little bit, but I stopped taking it for a couple of days and my face broke out a lot so I suppose that it is having some sort of an effect. An online review I read said that most people's skin cleared after eight months in an study, so I am staying positive.<br /><br />I started out by taking Swansons' Brewer's Yeast Powder, and mixed it in smoothies and grapefruit juice. I tried mixing it in orange juice, which was pretty bad, and even just having it with water, which was horrible and made me gag. Because I wasn't crazy about the taste, I read some reviews and decided to try this product next. The taste is much better, it is much less noticeable, especially if I add a little bit of peanut butter or grapefruit juice to the smoothies. The taste is also not at all noticeable in warmed apple juice. I don't have the courage to try it in plain water, though.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is that it does not dissolve well. I cannot stir it in any cold liquid without getting clumps (hopeless when stirred with a spoon or knife, somewhat works when stirred with a fork but little clumps remain), I can barely dissolve all of it in warmed liquids, and if I put it first in my blender when I make the smoothies, a lot of it remains at the bottom. In that respect, I liked Swansons' Brewer's Yeast better. This one is a little bit high maintenance because if I want to just have it in grapefruit juice, I have to put it in the blender first and when I make smoothies, I have to make sure that it's one of the last things to go in. I would, however, buy this product again if I can't find a brewers yeast that has the taste of this product with a better solubility.

review/text: this stuff is ok.  I was hoping it was the flakes but it's a very fine powder, like a flour consistency.  Which makes it kinda turn pasty when sprinkled on veggies or sprinkled on popcorn.  The taste isn't bad, not really great either, but not bad.  I think the yeast flakes would be better, more texture.  But since it only comes in the 3 bottle package, I have 3 bottles to get through now before I can buy the flakes!  If you're not sure you'll like it, try to find it in a single bottle first.

They have a rich rye flavor and hold up well to strongly flavored toppings like kippers or sprats.  To top it off, they're yeast free, have no GMO's, and only 30 calories a cracker.

review/summary: Perfect treats for any cat!
review/text: When I first got my kitten, he turned his little nose up at every treat we offered him. This made training him hard, but I accepted the fact that I had a picky kitten. When I went to the vet, the assistants were so excited to see him that they immediately offered him lots of treats. To my amazement, he psychotically gobbled them up and sniffed frantically to find more. The vet assistants told me cats go crazy for these soft, smelly, low-calorie treats. I bought this giant pack of them since at the vet they are rather expensive. One warning though is that they are a little crumbly (so they can get embedded in your carpet if you have a clumsy cat like mine) and are pretty smelly (like liver and grossness). Overall though, I highly, highly recommend these treats for any four-legged furry cat creature!!

review/summary: Superior dark chocolate covered marzipan
review/text: This review is from my site: chocolate ratings dot wordpress dot com.<br /><br />Marzipan, that soft concoction of ground almonds and sugar, has always intrigued me. I remember, as a child, looking through the bakery window at perfectly shaped and artfully colored miniature fruits and pink piglets. As an adult, I have always found marzipan fun to work with, whether forming it into unexpected shapes, like VW Bugs, or using it to blanket a chocolate rum cake, and adorning the top with a multitude of flat, rosy, marzipan hearts. With all that almond paste history, I was delighted to try Niederegger's version, as they have been making these treats for more than 200 years..<br /><br />I expected to like them, but I was blown away by the contrasting textures of soft, just-sweet-enough marzipan nestled in a perfectly tempered, delicious, glossy dark chocolate shell. The incredible freshness also made a big impression on me. If you like this classic German confection, I highly recommend their brand, and the Classic bar, in particular.<br /><br />Niederegger also makes a smaller, oval bar with a delicate coating of dark chocolate for those folks who like a higher marzipan to chocolate ratio.

review/summary: Decent and Fun Hot Chocolate
review/text: This Swiss Miss marshmallow madness hot cocoa mix is great! If you had to buy hot chocolate that both kids and adults would like and share together, then this Swiss Miss marshmallow madness would be it! The taste is decent. Don't expect it to be gourmet delicious like Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf's Dutch Chocolate mix, but it's pretty good, nice, and affordable. Besides their hot cocoa, I love Swiss Miss puddings. There are eight hot cocoa packets and eight marshmallow packets - sixteen packets total. Each serving is 130 calories. And this cocoa contains Vitamins A, C, E, B6, B12, Calcium, Iron, Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Phosphorus, Magnesium, and Zinc. The front of the box says that there is no artificial sweeteners. The Marshmallow Madness name is very befitting and cute - the colors of the marshmallows remind me of Spring flowers and the name reminds me of March Madness for NCAA men's basketball tournament. Anyways, Swiss Miss wasn't joking when they named this "Marshmallow Madness". There are lots of mini marshmallows per packet. I didn't bother to count the marshmallows per packet because there's a lot -- trust me! Quite a while back, some Amazon reviewers said that the original Swiss Miss with marshmallows didn't have enough marshmallows. This new Swiss Miss Marshmallow Madness more than makes up for that - it shows that Swiss Miss staffers are listening to and reading their customers' comments. Like I said before, I also like the fun marshmallow colors. I bought some extra boxes and gave them to co-workers and friends to share with their grandkids, nephews, nieces, etc. I bought these Swiss Miss hot cocoa mixes at a grocery store. I had to really reach the back of the shelf in order to get these boxes, and these marshmallow madness boxes were truly the bestselling boxes from the Swiss Miss brand at the grocery store! The marshmallow colors remind me of Lucky Charms and other kid's cereals with mini marshmallows. This hot cocoa with fun marshmallows motivates young kids to drink the hot cocoa. Overall, it's fun to share this hot cocoa with people. This is a great product from Swiss Miss!

This drink was pretty good, a little like coffee, but with more of a "sesame" type flavor. Other "pros" are that is a great value for the price, and being "instant" it was fasy & easy to prepare. That being said, I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5, as I have found a similar product (called Teeccino) to have a more coffee-like flavor and aroma.

review/text: Dragon Eye Oolong tea is fragrant and flavorful. It has hints of fruit and a smooth flavor. It holds up well even if you brew it with water that is too hot. (Other Oolong teas often taste "burnt" if the water is still boiling or is otherwise too hot for that particular tea. Not so with this one, from my experience.)  This is the same "Dragon Eye Oolong" tea served at P.F. Chang's restaurant if you want to sample it before buying it. It's great tea, and very distinct.

I missed the fact that these were single serve packets which one would place in a mug and then add hot water...  As I think about it, It may be the right way to do it, to put an entire contents into a mug and brew/add hot water into the mug, I just wasn't careful enough to notice it was in packets, not K-cup product I expected.<br /><br />I was recently served a K-cup apple cider by a friend and enjoyed it, both in the novelty of using the K-cup technology, and the steamy goodness of the beverage...  I wanted to give it a try with my new machine and I was just disappointed that what arrived was packets, not K-cup.  'Gift box' was appropriate title, and I wasn't discerning enough in my evaluation of the product description.<br /><br />I post this so you may get the product you may prefer.  : )<br /><br />I trust the Mott's brand and feel the Apple Cider may be kinda a nice little 'giftee' for someone this holiday season... : )

review/summary: My daughter is hooked on these...
review/text: My friend gave us a package of these that her son had outgrown.  We were using the Gerber banana puffs and I did not think our baby would like these Green puffs (Spinach, Collard Greens and Kale).  She does not like peas or green vegetables very much.  Boy was I wrong!  She loves these things.  They are by far her favorite (second favorite: Gerber Peach flavor).<br /><br />These are a great value here on Amazon especially if you do the subscribe & save.  The HappyBaby puffs give you 40% more puffs in a container than the Gerber variety, so consider that when purchasing.  These puffs are a little "poofier" - softer - than the Gerber variety and maybe a tiny bit larger.  Neither is bad or good, just an observation.  These are a big hit in my household, and I figure at least she's getting a few green vegetables in her diet somehow. :-)  I agree with the other reviewer that they kind of taste like a Cheerio, but you do get a bit of that vegetable taste on the "finish"...

The jar itself is great, and I love that they are BPA free, but the lid is a bit loose, and so it doesn't stay on well.  My 10 1/2 month old son loves the green flavor, but he wasn't so fond of the apple.  I tasted them to see if I could come up with a reason.  The "Green" puffs were more flavorful.  For this reason, I will probably not buy the apple again, but I will definitely buy the "Green" again.

review/summary: great stuff for starters.
review/text: We introduced this when our little one was 6-7 months old. She's 10 months old now and still enjoys it thoroughly. Apart from her eating it ..it helped tremendously in her picking abilities and other motor skills development. It helped us also to have dinner together with her sitting on the high chair and enjoying her puffs.

review/summary: Quite good for the baby that has not yet or is in the process of teething
review/text: We bought the pack of 6 almost five months ago for our baby boy and we still have one left after giving several of them away. He likes them and will eat them, but he is not mad about them. It really made a difference though during the teething process.

review/summary: Greens flavor just as tasty as Apple
review/text: I didn't see an organic alternative to the convenient Gerber puffs (which to me seem much better than Cheerios, since they dissolve), until finding these online.  These are GREAT!  My daughter's first sign is to ask for "more" of these.<br /><br />I started with the apple flavor, but my second box was this one - the veggie "greens."  They taste very similar, but you see little green specks in them, so I guess she is getting a small amount of veggies :-P  She seems to like them just as well as the apple.<br /><br />It took us a few months to go through one six-pack case.  A great value!

review/summary: great first finger food/snack
review/text: These are a great first finger food/snack.  They were much easier for my child to dissolve in her mouth than the Gerber brand.  Not sure if it's that because there's a whole in the middle so there is not as much solid mass in her mouth, but she loved them immediately and had no gagging problem like she did with the other brands. And you get more in the package as well.  We've only tried the Greens and the Apple, but we've liked them and I like that they're organic.

review/summary: THE BEST!
review/text: These taste like cheerios! My son loves them! I shove little pieces of cheese into them so my son (9 months) can enjoy cheese and "crackers". He loves them and we love how healthy they are... when he is finished he has a fun container to bang on and roll on the floor! Happy Baby products are AWESOME!

review/text: My 15 old month daughter loves these puffs.  I keep a stock for anytime we go out to eat or travel because I know they will keep her happy.  She is always signing "more, more" anytime I bring out the container.  She has been eating these since she was 8 month's old.

review/summary: wonderful
review/text: these are just as tasty as gerber puffs but they are organic, half the sugar and just as affordable.  They really are! When I bought these, they were actually cheaper than gerber puffs if you take into consideration that each container holds more.  Also, this is a very eco-friendly company who uses recycled materials whenever possible. The container these come in is recycled from Target Method products and it is BPA free!

review/summary: Good product
review/text: It is tasty and nutritious; whole grains, no corn; they have vitamin D; few baby foods do.<br />The bottle and cap are nice, does keep the product fresh unlike other brands.<br />And price is same or cheaper than the regular non-organic-junk fillers-finger food....so it is a no brainer.<br /> For some reason,my baby seems to like more the veggie one. Had no problem picking them up, and never choked on them (he did with others)<br /> My 3 year old also likes them.  And even though 6 bottles may seem a lot.........they go fast.  Expiration date was good (like seven months later).

review/summary: Happy Baby, indeed!
review/text: These little puffs are awesome!  The little chomper needed something to practice chewing on while eating, but not be a choking hazard... and portable, too.  I have avoided processed sugary foods so far, but this product is made from recognizable foods and is not high in sugar or salt.  And my little monkey loves them.

review/summary: By the case
review/text: I like that Happy Baby Puffs are an organic product that "melts" better than cereals like Cheerios. My 8-month-old doesn't get many in his mouth, but he likes them when he does. I wasn't thrilled about having to order by the case, but I was having trouble finding these in local stores. But I know we'll end up using them over the years. And of course I found them at Target the day after I ordered.

review/summary: Handy container
review/text: My 9 month old LOVES LOVES these snacks! I have one in every room of the house, in the stroller, the diaper bag, the car and at Nana's house.  My little one is happy as long as she's got her snacks! : )  They're easy for her to pick up and they dissolve in her mouth. She loves the apple and the greens as well.
