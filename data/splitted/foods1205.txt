review/summary: Not Taco Bell Cheese Sauce!
review/text: The marketing on this is very misleading. Having the Taco Bell brand on it would make anyone buying this product assume that it would taste like Taco Bell's cheese sauce. The same cheese sauce that they use in the restaurants and put on burritos and nachos. The truth is far from that assumption. In fact it tastes nothing like the nacho cheese sauce served in the restaurants. This is a very thick cheese sauce. When you spoon it out of the jar it leaves the indentions from the scoop in place. It's that thick. It does thin out some when heated. It also has a strong fake cheese flavor. You can doctor it up so to speak and use it as a base to make a better queso using extra melted cheese and milk.

I like Taco Bell branded taco and fajita sauces, so I thought it was worth a shot. It was not. Just gross. Took one bite and threw it out.<br /><br />The crazy thing is the label says its made with Kraft cheese. Kraft should cancel this cross-branding immediately. It makes them look bad. They must put a piece of Kraft in with a bunch of cheese-flavored gunk.

review/summary: No Interest from Avid Bone Chewers
review/text: I have 2 dogs, both lab mix, and these bones do not hold their interest.  They are agressive chewers and like just about type of bone I give them (antler, knuckle, sterilized and the like). They are especially eager when I give them a bone they've never tried before.  However, neither of them chewed these bones for more than 5 minutes.  The only part they seemed to like was the stuffing.  I dropped one on the floor and some of the stuffing came out and my boy ate that up.  But they did not enjoy them otherwise.

review/summary: OMG...seriously. It's amazing.
review/text: I sit here writing my review with a mouthful of this pasta as we speak. I purchased it yesterday to make a homemade pasta salad with ham and veggies and basil and other goodies. I'd previously tried a few different GF pastas and most were really subpar. One particularly popular brown rice pasta brand that claims "NOT MUSHY" all over the bag is unapalatable unless I cook it like, half the time it's supposed to be. "Can withstand a lot of overcooking"? It can't even withstand normal cooking.<br /><br />But this....<br /><br />this golden, delicious, chewy, al-dente, would-thinki-it-was-wheat-felt-like-I-had-to-double-check-the-package-to-make-sure-I-didn't-get-the-wrong-thing pasta?....Amazing. I couldn't believe it and still can't.<br /><br />The texture is EXACTLY like wheat pasta. It has a bite, it has a subtle chewiness. It doesn't taste weird, or have any grittiness. It doesn't get slimey or mushy. It holds its shape, even when I was stirring it up with all sorts of other ingredients and dressing. It's good cold. It's good hot. Holy cow it's just amazing.<br /><br />If this review didn't convince you to go try it, I'm not sure what will. I can mail you a bite of my pasta salad and as you weep with joy you can go get some. :)

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Pasta on the Market
review/text: Having a child with Severe Allergies to Dairy, Egg, Wheat, Barley & Rye has been a challenge. We've tried just about every brand of Gluten Free Pasta available today. Most is barely edible - rinsing or no rinsing, and quickly solidifies into a lump of starch before you can finish a bowl. Bionaturae's Gluten Free pastas (Fusilli, Spaghetti, Rigatoni, Penne, Linguine) is excellent! Fresh from the pot I'd call it indistinguishable from the usual high end, wheat based pastas everyone else is used to!<br /><br />My child, the real critic, asks for pasta at least 5 nights a week, and after several years, still hasn't gotten bored with this brand!<br /><br />I will say that I haven't had a lot of luck making a large pot, and storing left-overs to be eaten the next day as was my habit with wheat based pastas - it doesn't maintain its consistency after refrigeration, or reheat to the same level. Taste and consistency out of the pot though, are first rate. if you know of someone who has allergies, or wants to avoid gluten, I highly recommend this pasta!

Amazon is the best  price for this product. I am an amazon shopper for many other products and have been very satisfied.

review/summary: These are so good!
review/text: On a trip to the grocery store a few weeks ago I picked up a bag of these Pretzel Crisps in the original flavor to try out, while my mother grabbed a bag in the garlic parmesan flavor. A few days later we each brought our new pretzels to one of my daughters softball games to snack on. As I ate mine, my mother insisted I try hers. Oh wow are these garlic parmesan ones good! It's not even a flavor I would normally have thought I would like, as I tend to like simpler flavors. But these are just so good, even a picky eater like myself love them. So on my next trip to the store I picked up 3 bags for myself and I'm snacking on them now.<br /><br />If you can envision a pretzel that has been rolled out flat with a rolling pin, that's what these are like. You get more of the crispy outside and much less of the white flour center you usually have with pretzels. Because they have a flat design, they even work as crackers. So you can top them with cheese, meats etc and use them with dips, just like you would a cracker, only they taste even better. They are very crispy, but don't crumble or fall apart when trying to eat them. The bags are resealable, and the seal works extremely well. The best part is since they have so much flavor, you can eat just a few and it feels like you've eaten a lot more. Lots of flavor is a smaller package.<br /><br />The nutritional info is:<br />Serving size: 10 crackers/pretzels<br />Fat: 1.5g per serving<br />Calories: 110 per serving<br />Carbs: 22g per serving<br />Sodium: 410mg per serving<br />And there is a warning that these are made in a facility that processes milk and soy, for those with allergies to them.

When we would have a long all-day meeting in the conference room, he would sneak into the pantry and nab as many fun size bars as he can to snack on during discussions.<br /><br />As such, a few of my other colleagues and I decided to get him this 6-pack as a cute fun gift. He loved it. Unfortunately it's still chocolate and still has calories, so he had to have his family hide the bars all over his house. This way, he could still surface one if he tried really hard to find it, but it was work... and it prevented him from stuffing all into his face at once!

review/text: I love Navitas Naturals products! So I thought if they were making it, I could give wheatgrass a try. I admit I was a little too wimpy to just dump it into a glass of water or juice. But what I did do was mix it into my homemade salad dressing and have it with lunch everyday for a few days. I didn't think much of it til by the third day I was thinking I felt really awake and energetic that afternoon. Then I realized I'd gotten a nice boost the day before too! It's definitely no energy shot (not a big fan of those), but it's a nice natural boost to make it through the afternoon lull. The only downside that is it is super pricey. So I may try another brand or two & then make a decision about what to stick with.

review/summary: Definitely not gluten free
review/text: There's always some debate about whether wheat grass juice/powder is safe for gluten-sensitive people. It's presumed that since the grain is gone, then the protein that causes a reaction for many people is also gone; wheat grass is supposed to be just the stalk.  Not so with this product. I am normally a big fan of Navitas stuff but this one disappointed me. It's somehow contaminated with gluten b/c I took some and instantly got my typical reaction to gluten. So if anyone gluten-sensitive is considering trying a wheat grass powder, definitely avoid this one.

review/summary: hmm... dogs enjoy, but there are healthier liver treat options
review/text: My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is "made with liver".<br /><br />My dogs absolutely love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce</a> (the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesn't have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.<br /><br />Specifically, these treats have chicken "by-products"-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:<br /><br />Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide.<br /><br />bil-jac, dogs, cookies, biscuits, snacks, dog toy, treat, training, liver, treats, agility, obedience, bil-jac foods inc

review/text: These are an old standard and are never refused.  Obviously they are yummy to dogs, and small enough that they won't become chunky getting rewarded with them.  Regarding "high fructose corn syrup" - that concern is so "yesterday" - if you eat a balanced diet and you feed your pet a balanced diet (nobody would be deluded into thinking this is a "meal") you don't have to worry about whether your sugar comes from cane or corn or other.  Let's get a life and stop obsessing over the health scare of the day!!!  At least they're not eating chicken strips or rawhide from CHINA (check your packages, folks)!!!

review/summary: Works for me - at half dose
review/text: I am a nurse that works night shift and travels frequently. Between the two, I have a funky sleep schedule and sometimes go through periods of extreme insomnia.<br /><br />Then, at the airport in Long Beach, CA I found Dream Water. I was a little shocked at the price but decided to try it anyway. Because it was expensive, I tried half a shot and it worked, well, like a dream. A whole shot makes me do weird things in my sleep, but a half shot makes me fall asleep and get a good 6-8 hours with no hangover effect - even during my severe episodes of insomnia.<br /><br />As a nurse, I would like to recommend that you be careful taking it every day. One of the ingredients (5-HTP) can cause serotonin syndrome in certain doses. Since we don't know the exact dose they use, I would look up serotonin syndrome and be on the look out for side effects if you take it regularly. Just in case. I haven't had any side effects, but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />Also, be careful mixing it with certain other meds used to adjust mood (anxiety/depression meds) or other sleep aids - even natural ones. Just a heads up.

review/summary: Seems to help but tastes BAD!
review/text: I've been giving this a try. It doesn't make me fall asleep faster or stay asleep longer, but I think I get a better quality of sleep with it, so that although I'm not getting any more sleep than without it, I wake up without the usual headache and the lead-weight exhaustion that I usually wake up with.<br /><br />The down side is that it tastes absolutely horrid. If you're trying it for the first time, get the cap off and take it down FAST, before you can change your mind.<br /><br />Be careful (or maybe ask a doc) if you combine it with allergy meds. It claims to have no contraindications, but when taking it with cetirizine HCL (a generic OTC allergy medication), I found it resulted in dizziness. Nothing in the product should cause that reaction on its own, but perhaps one of the inactive ingredients interacts with the cetirizine HCL. Definitely wouldn't take the two together if I were flying -- it might contribute to motion sickness, and also there's the issue of unstable footing, if a person had to move about on the aircraft.

I don't like medicine- I haven't even taken a Tylenol in years- so it was very hard for me to find a solution for my sleeping problems. Teas are natural, but don't work are all, and pills have nasty side effects. Dream Water is natural and effective!!! I also love that I don't have to count calories, because I do take this regularly.<br />It is powerful enough to help you fall asleep, but mild enough that you can wake up whenever you want to, without leaving you groggy or out of it. Both flavors are great!<br />By it for yourself- and if you want to make other busy/stressed out people very happy (your friends, your parents, your teachers, your coworkers, etc), spread it around!!

review/summary: Works for someone who's had sleep issues all his life!
review/text: My 16-year-old has had trouble getting to sleep since he was an infant, and, of course, we've never wanted to give him sleep medications.  We've tried herbal preparations without success, and then I brought home a bottle of this stuff from the grocery store.  He tried it, and it worked!  I now buy it by the case.  He's very particular about the taste of food, yet he's never complained about Dream Water.  (I keep it in the refrigerator, and perhaps the cold helps with the taste.)<br /><br />An update to my review:  I don't know if it's because the stuff is so popular or what, but it took my last order an inordinate amount of time to arrive.  So I'm placing a re-order way ahead of when we run out to allow time for the shipping process to complete.  My son still likes it, and it's still working for him...

I use it in my confit and cassoulet and also with making co qu vin. You can get this separately as base herbs such as thyme, basil, fennel and savory( the latter may be a bit more difficult to acquire) for less and make it yourself.<br />Overall, I am happy with my purchase and will be willing to spend another $15 on the cute little corck pot as gifts or for myself.

review/summary: Cute Crock But ...
review/text: The crock is cute, even though the writing on it these days is on a clear sticker adhered to the crock instead of on the crock itself.<br /><br />The 11 ounce version of their crock is hefty and spectacular.  It's the size of a small cooking pot.<br /><br />The thing is though that you are better off keeping the herbs in a zip-seal plastic bag with all the air squeezed out of it.  The herbs in the crock are nowhere near as fragrant a month later as when you first unseal the crock, even if you keep the lid on in between uses.  You want to keep them in a zip-seal bag and then rolled as tight as possible before resealing to get as much air out as possible, and then store in a cool, dark place.<br /><br />For this reason you want to buy in small quantities, not the 11 ounce version, no matter how attractive (unless you want to store your rolled zip-seal bag in it).  I'd skip this size crock and just buy the refill box for this reason.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XY22E2">Anysetiers de Roy Herbes de Provence Refill</a><br /><br />As far as flavor and aroma, this is head and shoulders the best blend of herbes de Provence you will find.  I've tried a few.  Even if they're the same classic blend of thyme, savory, basil, fennel, and lavender (as they should be to be called herbes de Provence), they don't smell or taste as good as this particular brand.<br /><br /> This is still the one to beat.  I highly recommend it without reservation, but the days of storing it in crocks, though cute, have gone.  These aren't inexpensive.  Make the most of them by getting all that air out and sealing them in plastic.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, despite how it's spelled for this product, the correct way is Herbes de Provence or Herbs of Provence, not Herbs de Provence.  The Herbs part should have an "e" before the "s" for the French spelling.

I have a stash of pickles in my pantry because I know that some of the stores do not consistently stock my favorites, Famous Dave's, which are too spicy for my husband to eat by the jar full. So, to provide an alternative we found the Mt. Olive Bread and Butters and they are excellent.  They are sweet enough, but not too sweet, pleasantly tangy but not overly so.I will no doubt order more as soon as we make our way through our first 128 ounces. They fit in the pantry right next to my supply of Famous Dave's, and I enjoy both. And I have not even begun to discuss my supply of dills and gherkins!

review/summary: What it is....
review/text: As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying "fresh" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh.

review/summary: Every day source of Vitamin B12
review/text: I am fortunate that my local Kroger carries this item. As a long time vegan, I try to fulfill my nutritional need for Vitamin B12 by adding nutritional yeast flakes to pasta dishes. I could eat pasta with tomato sauce every day, and I usually have it at least once a day. I sprinkle the nutritional yeast ( 1-2 tablespoons) on my plate before placing the hot steaming pasta on top of the yeast.  The nutritional yeast gets mixed in while I swirl the pasta. This is how I avoid getting moisture from the steam into the jar of yeast and ruining it.<br /><br />I love the cheesy flavor of the yeast, although I think if a former cheese-lover had abruptly stopped  eating cheeses and become vegan, it could be a while before the nutritional yeast's flavor became a satisfactory substitute for real cheese. I also sprinkle nutritional yeast on homemade vegan pizzas, alone or in addition to a topping of vegan Daiya cheese, to add even more cheese-like flavor. Anyway, I am vegan for the sake of the animals, so having vegan foods that taste a little bit like cheese is just a bonus for my palate. I would be vegan even if there were no vegan cheese flavored substitutes.  I actually started to eat Nutritional yeast for the B vitamins, then I fell in love with the flavor.  Some people say to choose the flakes, like the Bragg's, but not the powdered form of nutritional yeast. I don't know why, though.

review/text: A friend of mine, studying nutrition, suggested this as an easy source of protein.  It's a good replacement for parmesan cheese that is loaded with vitamin B2.<br /><br />After sprinkling on my food for two weeks, I noticed no more bruising on my legs.<br /><br />Great snack recommendation: nutritional yeast and Braggs Sprinkle, no salt.

review/text: I've been trying to lose weight and eat a healthy diet, so I bought this along with some other products a couple of weeks ago because I was going to add this to things like popcorn and vegetables since the description said this had a cheesy flavor; plus I could use the extra fiber.  The day after I received this, I put some on my air popped popcorn and took it to work with me.  I ate a couple of pieces and ended up throwing the bag out.  I'm not really sure how to describe the taste, but it's definitely not a cheese like flavor.  I didn't like it at all.

review/summary: Awesome horsepills
review/text: First off, I think the reviews on this page are confusing.  It seems to me there is a mix of people who bought the container of oil and those that bought the pills.<br /><br />I bought the pills and am enjoying them very much.  I read news reports on how coconut oil may help with Alzheimers, diabetes and diet so I thought I'd try them since I have issues with all of these in my family line.  I feel more mentally focused and alert since I've started taking them a week or so ago.  I definitely plan to continue to take the pills.<br /><br />They are large as many people have noted (see my photo uploaded with the quarter), but they are not any bigger than any other large vitamin.  The pills, like other vitamins, do have a slight smell if you stick your nose in the bottle.  But they have no taste, no after taste and no gross burps later.<br /><br />The bottle calls for 3 pills 3x a day.  9 seems pretty excessive for vitamins.  I'm taking 6 right now, 3 with my coffee in the morning and 3 with dinner since I usually only have 1 or 2 meals a day.<br /><br />I would note that taking these has loosened some things up, you know -- down there.  It's not an emergency bathroom thing but you probably will be flowing pretty freely when you do go.  I'm assuming my body will eventually adjust and become more regular but it's not really bother if it doesn't.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: My primary reason for buying this product was to help my digestive system.  I have iron deficiency anemia, but I could not tolerate any brand of iron supplement, and the shots were extremely painful. So I became extremely anemic and needed transfusions. Consequently, I couldn't take a chance anymore on not using iron tablets and I had to find a way to take them without suffering.<br />Because I use coconut oil and milk in my cooking and for skin/hair care, I've done research on the benefits of this amazing seed, and I thought that these capsules might help me to tolerate iron tablets.  Well they have, and I am now able to tolerate 3 daily doses of ferrous sulfate, so I'm in compliance with my doctors orders and my hemoglobin level is rising.

review/text: This oil has a rancid, off-putting odor that smells NOTHING like coconut, more like yeast.  It also has a TERRIBLE taste.  DO NOT BUY!!!<br /><br />I consume a jar of coconut oil a week because I take it as a supplement and cook with it.  Jarrow, Spectrum, Nutiva, Vitacost and Swanson are MUCH better.  Their coconut oils smell really good with a fresh, coconut scent and taste great too.<br /><br />I was surprised because I use other NOW products and am happy with them. The quality, judging by my experience & others', is that this may just be a faulty jar but the quality isn't consistent.  I don't see bad reviews from the other oils I use & I have never had a bad batch from the others I have mentioned.

review/text: Purchased this and Flaxseed Oil to help punch up my HDL "good" cholesterol levels. Not sure how it is working yet but they seem to work fine and I feel better taking them. We also use Coconut oil in bulk form for cooking as the fat composition is supposed to be better for you than other vegetable oils. As for capsules, I have read other reviews that say these "taste bad".... but I have never had this problem. Because they are capsules I am unsure how anyone could taste them anyway, unless they were punctured or chewed. They are rather large capsules, but they go down fine. I would recommend them.

review/summary: Coconut Palms and Ocean Breezes: Paradise Rising?
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 9:08 Mins<br /><br /></span>While this review features the book, COCONUT OIL MIRACLE, it displays and describes other products [including coconut oil] which that book catalyzed into a healing synergy. I've reviewed most of the products shown in this video.<br /><br />Johanna Galt, thank you for your comment and question posted under the original written review I had submitted here, which I've deleted and replaced with this video [6/25/10]. Most of the content below was written in response to your question.<br /><br />I had purchased this brand a few years ago, and to be honest, I don't recall much about the flavor.  It was my first experience cooking with coconut oil, and I hadn't yet read any books on it.  The brands I've used recently and favor most for quality, aroma, and flavor are:<br /><br />EFAGold Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin, Organic, 16 oz.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Both of those brands, from my experience, are excellent quality.<br /><br />When I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle (by Bruce Fife)</a> I learned a greater variety of uses of the oil and how to work with its relatively hard texture.  I had kept it in the refrigerator until I read Fife's book and learned the oil [if it's in good condition when purchased] could be safely kept in the cupboard, usually for a year or more.  There's lots of interesting, valuable information in that book, which helped me conveniently expand my usage of this miracle oil.<br /><br />I had recently read the later reviews on this NOW Foods offering and had felt that possibly I was lucky to get a better quality batch than some of those reviewers, because I don't recall the oil tasting off.  But after reading those reviews and experiencing what might be higher quality products [linked above], I will probably stay with EFAGold or Nutiva, but I'm curious enough to try the NOW Foods product on this page again for flavor and purity comparison, in case the poor reviews came from an uncommon occurrence of a bad batch of the product.<br /><br />The EFAGold jar I received seemed to be of slightly higher quality, but Nutiva is very near as good, and sometimes priced more economically.  The information on some of the Amazon product pages for Nutiva is interesting, very helpful, and impressive.  I'm now cooking so much with the oil that I bought the larger size, Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 oz.  But I will also keep the 15 oz jars, as they're convenient to take with me away from home.<br /><br />To be fair, I should buy this NOW brand again to compare it to these others which I've experienced.  I've used other NOW Foods products and have been pleased with them.<br /><br />I've noticed additional brands available on Amazon which look good, too.  From the information in Fife's book, I might try any oil which is cold pressed [ANH, absolutely no heat] and extra virgin.<br /><br />I LOVE cooking with coconut oil.  It seems to me to enhance the integrity of the flavor of the food it's used with, and the savory flavor of beef steaks and other stronger meats can be furthered and the coconut edge removed by use of garlic, onions, and salty spices added to the oil when cooking.<br /><br />Some of my reviews on the above linked product pages give different information from this one, and hopefully more helpful written information from the original one which had been posted here.  In view of some of the comments and the collected "NO" votes on that review, I decided to post this video, to delete the original written review, and plan to include a copy of it at the end of the first 6 comments which had been made on the original review.<br /><br />May pleasant aromas follow your nose,<br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />NOTE: If you have a magnesium deficiency like many people are experiencing now, feel free to read some of my reviews on magnesium products for information about ways to retain that index mineral into your system at adequate levels.  Most coconut oil has a lot of potassium in it, which can replace some of the needed magnesium.

review/summary: Awesome Product...
review/text: MY EXPERIENCE WITH COCONUT:<br />A few things first... I have done extensive research on Coconut oil & the benefits it has on our bodies.  I can tell you that the antiviral benefits it has definitely works. After a couple of days of sleeping a ton, being very sick & calling me at work crying because she couldn't stay awake, I took my daughter (13 y.o. then 17 now) to the doctor & she was diagnosed with Mono. The doctor explained to me that it is part of the Epstein Barr family (cold sores, herpes, etc.) and that there isn't any kind of medicine that can "cure" the illness. He explained that she would sleep a lot, that I needed to call her school & tell them what she had & that she would only be there half days for a few months. I was deflated, stressed & couldn't believe there was nothing I could do for her. I had recently read a book that included coconut oil as a way to detox, lose weight, boost metabolism and so many others and had bought some oil to cook with & take daily. I had done a search & read as much as I could about the coconut & remembered reading that it killed the Epstein Barr virus. I went straight to my computer when I got home & did another search & found the article I had read. I decided to give my daughter the oil twice a day to see if it helped her. I called her down & melted the oil in a spoon & had her take it that afternoon & then again later that evening.  The next morning before I left for work I gave her another dose. She called me around lunch time very happy and excited and said she wasn't tired and could stay awake. I remember thinking that the oil was working and was very relieved, but still a bit hesitant.  When I got home to my surprise, she was very excited, wide awake & for the first time since she was sick, was chipper and I could tell she was getting back to her old self. I gave her another dose of the oil that evening & for a few days after and she was all better.  The oil had killed the virus and restored her health.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who has any illness, pain or arthritis type conditions.  My old dog eats some oil, that I cook with, in his food for treatment of possible arthritis in his hip. He has stopped limping & can raise up from a laying/sitting position better than he has in a long time. It is also the first thing he eats in his bowl (I just take about a tablespoon and toss it on top of the dry food). HE LOVES IT!!<br /><br />ABOUT THIS PRODUCT HERE:<br />I have been taking these pills for about 3 weeks now to help raise my metabolism & to help lower my cholesterol.  I haven't been back to the doctor to see how it is working for my cholesterol, but I can say that it has boosted my energy levels more than any other oil or coconut product I have tried yet.  The closest I've come to this level of energy boost was when I drank some homemade coconut milk from a coconut we bought from the store. Also, When I dropped my daughter off at work yesterday, she was exhausted (stayed up late texting or Twittering I would bet)& I handed her one of these pills & told her it would give her energy... As she walked away she stuck it right in her mouth & swallowed it!! When she came home that night I asked her if the pill worked & she said yes!!  From a TEEN mind you!! This is the same child up top there that knows that this stuff works! I highly recommend this product if you are a coconut user and if you're not... What the H E double toothpicks are you waiting for???

review/summary: On a coconut kick...
review/text: Besides my balsamic kick, I'm kind of on a coconut kick. Purchased a few books stating how good coconut oil is for us. I've been cooking with it which I think actually makes things cook better (tastier). The literature I've read states that coconut supplements are good for you. So, I figured I'd try it. Can't say one way or another if it works. Haven't felt different (good or bad) since taking it. Good news is there is no weird after taste (like you can experience with fish oils).

For the longest time, I've been mixing it with my smoothies to aid in nutrient absorption and for the energy benefits. Not only is it fantastic health wise, the taste and smell is beyond perfection. The only downside is that it is a bit pricey for me, but hey, that's what it takes to purchase a high quality product like this. On a side note, the left over glass jars make excellent storage containers and can even be used for flower pots, so ultimately, the price is totally worth it.

review/summary: Just by chance
review/text: I happened to surf on to a site touting the benefits of coconut oil. I purchased a jar of Kelapo Extra Virgin Coconut Oil... Cold pressed. I have been using it daily as a face moisturizer and I am impressed. I am seventy years old and I wish I would have learned this secret long ago. It is so pure and melts on my fingers as I apply it to my face. It soaks right in and feels so good. Over the years I have tried all the known brands of facecream, and this is better than any.  Not only are my "wrinkles" looking better, my skin appears brighter. The price is nothing compared to a jar of hyped-up, full of unwanted ingredients, etc. expensive facecream.  I feel like I truly have discovered a product, and such a simple one, that is making a differience.  Love it and I can cook with it, too!

review/summary: Amazing - tastes great!
review/text: I've tried a couple different brands of coconut oil at this point and this one is the best.  It has the best flavor but is mild enough to use as a substitute for oil in baking recipes.  I use it in place of canola oil in pancakes, in place of butter on toast, etc.  Absolutely fantastic and love that it is cold-pressed and unrefined!

review/text: The smell was way to fishy, and I just could not tolerate eating the product. It is still sitting on my shelf after opening the first one after several months.

review/summary: Best tasting caffene gum by far
review/text: Tastes very similiar to the Amp Energy drink but slightly better.  Kind of like if you mixed Mountain Dew with Sprite.  Much better than the mint flavored Jolt gum which tastes like mint gum with a horrible after taste.  Plus it is actually sugar-free which is better on the teeth
