review/summary: Great tea/better price
review/text: Sometimes it's hard to find good quality products for the K-cups. This is a good tea. I love green tea and this is a good brand. I like this brand and Bigelow organic green tea. I think the Bigelow is my slight favorite, but this is good tea. No aftertaste and nor are there grounds in the bottom of the cup. The price on this one puts everything to shame. Usually the K-cups are more expensive, so this is a bargain. Get it now.

review/summary: Better than Starbucks!
review/text: I love this stuff! I add sugar and half and half and get a drink that is very much like Starbucks Chai Latte. The price on the product has gone up since I ordered it on Jan. 7th 2011 -- so, I ordered the CS Indian Spice Chai tea bags instead. I put 2 teabags in MY K-Cup and it tastes exactly the same. You get 6 boxes of 20, so that is 60 servings for me (2 bags at a time) for the 13.95 (subscribe and save) these cups used to be. If I want the tea a bit stronger, I will remove the tea bags after brewing from the my k-cup and throw them in my mug. Let is steep a bit longer and it is wonderful!

review/summary: Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai
review/text: What I was expecting was a chai tea similar to one I find in popular coffee houses: a spiced tea infused with cream and sugar. This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's, Bigelow and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test. The K-cup chais are simply not the same as the coffee house chais. To approximate the coffee house chai you'll need to add your own cream/milk and sugar/honey and give it a little shake.

review/summary: Delicious with 5 spice aromas, not full of sugar and cream
review/text: This India Spice Chai while brewing fills the whole room with wonderful aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves almost like the Chinese 5 spice blend.  There is no added sugar or cream so if you want that go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GQHXA">Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack</a>.  Those k-cups which are delicious as well have the cream that many expect in a chai tea.  This particular brand of Celestial Seasonings is just tea.  You can add what you want after the fact.  I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing.  This is just a nice cup of spiced tea.  It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most. I really like it and highly recommend.

review/summary: Converted me to tea over coffee - it's that good
review/text: Before buying my Keurig brewer, I never really like black tea.  I would drink herbal tea from tme to time but black tea always seemed too bitter.  After trying Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast Tea, I was instantly converted.  There is no bitter taste and it's so much less acidic than coffee and therefore much easier on my stomach.  It has a mild, slightly fruity taste that is perfect with breakfast or really anytime of day.  I've tried it plain and with a bit of milk and sugar as well.  I honestly have become more of a tea drinker than coffee drinker since trying this delicious tea.

review/summary: Where's The Cardamon?  Prepare for the Cloveaload!
review/text: If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you.  If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is "this is NOT chai tea."  There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea.  As it is, it should be called "spicy clove tea."  This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices.  It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves.  I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region.  Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors.  Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision.  I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically.<br /><br />I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a "traditional" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand.  For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the "chai" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original.

review/text: I love this chai, and it makes a much better chai latte than I've tried in any k-cup before.  To be clear, this doesn't come with powdered milk or cream, so you have to add your own cream in order to make it a latte.<br /><br />I have disliked all of the pre-mixed latte k-cups I've tried because of a combination of artificial sweatener (which they all seem to insist on adding) and the powdered creamer (which is worse than fresh).  I add my own sugar and cream to this chai, and it is delicious!<br /><br />When I tried this without cream and sugar, it tasted slightly heavy on the clove.  With the cream and sugar, though, I don't have any complaints.

No amount of honey and milk could make this right for me.  I am suffering through my 24-pack and may just throw it out.  Very disappointing.  I've had this brand/flavor in the bags before (although not recently) and liked it just fine.  Even bought it multiple times.  Not sure what is not working right with the k-cup formula.

review/summary: Celestial India spice chai tea k-cups
review/text: I brew this in a keurig 60 model, i like this tea, its good any time of the year. It is on the spicy side and will leave your pallet with a spicy after taste. But oh so good late at night. Good tea for every once in a while, i could not drink this every day as is a little on the strong side.

I usually re-order two boxes every couple of months, and my package always arrives quickly. I'll be buying these k-cups as long as they're available!

review/summary: Very weak taste.....
review/text: I have purchased the Celestial Seasonings Chai Tea tea bags in the grocery store, and was impressed with the flavor. So when I saw they had them in the K-cups, I immediately jumped on them and ordered a box. I was so disappointed in it. It tastes nothing like their regular tea bag version. Weak is a word I would use. And I'm not sure what kind of spices they put it in, but it's nothing like any other chai tea I've had. I do not recommend this brand. If you're a regular chai drinker, you will notice the difference and likely be disappointed.

review/summary: Potent!
review/text: This stuff is surprisingly strong and potent. I've always had a problem with chai tea bags because they brew such a dilute cup of tea. But with the Celestial Seasonings Keurig chai, the tea is dark and opaque. I got a huge buzz off of the caffeine. Best of all, it's pure tea and spices, unlike the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte, which is full of artificial ingredients.

review/summary: Couldn't even finish one cup
review/text: I'm an avid chai drinker--many different varieties of both lattes and straight black tea.  We purchased this product because we noticed that the Cafe Escapes chai lattes--a sweeter, creamier blend--did not actually have much black tea in it, and we still wanted our morning caffeine.  Neither my husband nor I could finish one mug of this stuff, and we will end up getting rid of the box.  It was that awful. There was none of the subtle spice blending--just a watery slightly clove-tasting flavor undercut by a bitterness that almost had hints of coffee. Adding a little milk, as we usually do, didn't help at all.  If you enjoy chai, I'd recommend Bigalow or Tazo and skip this one.

I have fancier or more old fashioned tea brewing methods that I use when I have more time, but I default to this green tea when I need a quick fix.<br /><br />Now about the tea specifically - I have tried other green tea k-cups (competing brands), and none have been as clean-tasting and crisp as Celestial Seasonings.  I will continue to purchase this brand for my green tea needs.

review/text: I enjoy chai tea very much and my partner drinks only tea, no coffee. So when we purchased our Keurig, we wanted to try several varieties of chai to find the perfect one. I shopped on amazon and bought several types with  reviews, cost, recognizable brand and speed of shipping being accounting factors ( in that order).<br /><br />Pros: Quick delivery<br />  The description is accurate and you get exactly what is advertised<br />  Known brand<br />  Fresh<br />  The price is moderate<br /><br />Cons: I mention price here again because it is cheaper in other forms ( tea bags)<br /><br />I prefer a non milk based Chai and so this was the ideal for me. I added sugar some days and drank it plain others and both were satsifying. My partner and I both enjoyed it above all the other flavors and I will reccomend and share with friends and family. I will continue to shop and attempt to find a better price, but would pay this again because it is worth it.

review/text: I tried this because I can't seem to find the Gloria Jean Serenity Tea which I liked very much.  The Celestial Seasonings was very very bland.  I even tried it on the smallest cup, and it made no difference.  There is no authentic flavor here.  I was brought up drinking green tea.  I especially like the Yama Moto brand green tea, but wanted something quick and easy in a k-cup. I like the Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Spice so I thought I would try the green tea.  I realize that coffee and tea are a personal preference.  For me, this green tea missed the mark completely.

I hadn't realized how bitter the Bigelow was, I can't drink it any longer!!  I'm a purest when it comes to my black tea, I don't like too many other flavors superseding the tea.<br /><br />I wish I could get this in tea bags too (to carry in my purse when at restaurants, at friends houses and what not)!<br /><br />The Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast is just an super-enjoyable cup of tea!

review/summary: Wonderful hot or cold!
review/text: This is my favorite of the K-Cup Chai recipes. The spices are balanced though fairly strong allowing this tea to hold up well with the additions of honey (or sugar) and milk. It's wonderful served hot or cold. For the cold version, add your honey (or sugar) and milk, stir, and then pour over ice. When doing the iced version, I find it works best brewed on the 6oz size and then poured over ice in a 24oz glass. I prefer this to the Chai Latte K-Cups because I can control the amount of sweetener and milk.

review/summary: not the best chai tea I've tasted
review/text: This India spice chai tea wasn't my favorite purchase. In fact, I am thinking I would relist the unused teas in the container and get rid of it. Hopefully someone out there loves it. It's almost a new box.

review/text: This is my favorite salad dressing. It has just the right amount of tangyness and great flavor. Not too overpowering with the bacon. In fact, sometimes I put extra bacon bits in my salad.<br /><br />I just cannot find this anywhere anymore except for here on Amazon. A bit pricey, though.

review/summary: Awesome TASTE !!
review/text: I first found this delicious item in a local grocery store, trying to find something similar to the Tangy Tomato dressing flavor at Outback. I discovered a GREAT flavor, but to my disdain I cannot find it in grocery stores any longer. Thankfully Amazon has this offered or I'd be searching again. Try it, you'll like it too...not too much bacon flavor and a bit on the sweet side blended nicely with the mild tomato taste.

review/summary: Changed the recipe & labeling
review/text: Ordered directly from Amazon.  Label on box said Tangy Tomato & Bacon Dressing & Marinade.  Bottles inside are labeled Tangy Bacon CATALINA Dressing & Marinade.  Not Amazons' fault, Kraft says it is the same recipe as Tangy Tomato & Bacon, but it tastes slightly different than the original.

review/text: This product itself is 5 star. I ordered the 6 pack. I have less than 3 months before all six bottles expire! IF I had found this in a grocery store I would have had 6 months to a year before they expired. My Conclusion is Amazon is selling old stock. Old books or electronics is fine; but old food is not!

review/text: FYI, this product is no longer on Kraft's website. If I were you, I'd buy as much as I possibly could.<br /><br />This salad dressing was so good that half of our party went back for SECONDS on salad and used up one bottle in a night. It is truly worth it, and I highly recommend buying a 6-pack.

review/text: I could not find this flavor in the local stores anymore, so I was pleased to find it at Amazon. Its a tangy tomato dressing, a little sweet, with the taste of bacon mixed in. It doesn't have the peppery taste of the other Catalina dressing. Mmm Mmm Good!

review/text: I cannot find this salad dressing in my area anymore, I have ordered 2 times on Amazon and it must be ordered in a case of 6 bottles, which is fine, however when it arrives all of the bottles have the same expired date. I ordered this in Dec. and all the bottles expired in Jan. the next month. In order for it to get used we have to give it away. This happened both times.<br />Very disappointed for this to happen both times. Will not order again.

review/text: This is one of the best marinades and dressing that I have ever come across! Great on salads and chicken. It's a real shame that Kraft doesn't distribute this item more. Amazon is the only place that I have been able to find it, and even here it is not readily available. I will continue to buy it as long as I can find it.

review/summary: Very bad shipping packaging
review/text: I agree with a prior review that the fresh until date was VERY short. All six bottles had dents (thank goodness they weren't glass!) and one had a cracked cap. However, this dressing is so delicious and so hard to find that I can forgive the terrible shipping packaging and short date. If you can find this dressing locally, grab all you can.

review/text: This dressing is a welcome change of pace for a number of salad combos. Wonderful flavor, not too tangy or too sweet. Also try it as a dip for chicken tenders or as a bit of sauce on a bacon cheese burger for. Since my household is very small, I opted not to get a case, but I am able to find in readily in several supermarket chains in the northern Virginia area. This works for us.

review/text: Fantastic.  I have been searching for a store/distributor for months and months.  I had almost given up, but that's when the magic happened.  This flavor is discontinued by Kraft.  Yes, I wrote them a letter and called them, but that's when I got the bad news.  Later on, I was on Amazon.com and figured it couldn't hurt to try their site as well.  Magic, I tell you, shear magic.<br /><br />ABrooks

review/summary: Works great during my pregnancy
review/text: During my pregnancy, I read that raspberry leaf tea can help strengthen the uterus for labor. I started drinking this tea 3 times a day on my 39th week. Before I went into the hospital for a cervadil and induction, I used 2 tea bags and infused it for 30 minutes. I brought some tea bags with me to drink during my stay at the hospital. This is my 2nd pregnancy and this time was more positive and less tramatic for me. I only had to push my son out 3 times before he came out on his own. The contractions were strong enough to push him out without any help from me. I certainly believe this tea helped my labor to be shorter and easier for me. I felt better and stronger for the last 2 weeks of my pregnancy than the whole 9 months. I also like the smell and taste of this tea. I continued to drink this tea for my recovery from giving birth. This tea has become my favorite drink now. I definitely recommend drinking this tea during the last few weeks (starting 34 weeks) of pregnancy.
