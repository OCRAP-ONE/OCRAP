review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: These are soo good! I just ate one and it was like eating a chocolate rice crispy treat - these bars are kind of chewy (not too hard, not too soft), but they are made of sesame seeds, organic cocoa, vanilla, brown rice syrup and peanuts :-)<br /><br />It's completely natural (no hydrogenated corn syrup!), plus it's gluten free. I don't have celiac disease, but I try to not make it a big part of my diet because I don't think its good for you. You get 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein, so it helps keep you satiated. I'd definitely recommend getting this - its delicious and you can actually feel good about eating it!

review/summary: Where has this stuff been all my life ? ?
review/text: I cannot say how sorry I am that after 45 years of pie making, that I only discovered Clear Jel� this year. I consider myself a good cook, and my pie-making skills top notch, but I've had my fair share of pies turn out soupy or way too stiff with whatever I chose to thicken the filling with - flour, cornstarch, tapioca flour, arrowroot and others. Sometimes the amount I used was too much, sometimes too little, and leftover pies would "weep" in the refrigerator. I've made a half-dozen pies now using Clear Jel� for the thickener and, honestly, it seems to be foolproof. The first time I used it I made a picture-perfect marionberry pie that tasted as good as it looked. The filling didn't budge an inch after cutting the pie - it was firm without being stiff, with a soft and smooth mouth feel.  Most important, not a single drop of juice ran. With no watery juice, the crust did not turn into a layer of purple mush; instead it remained a distinctly separate layer of flakey goodness.  The vacant spots left on the pie plate after removing some slices were bare and dry - just a few crumbs from the crust.  Where in the world has this stuff been all my life?<br /><br />The "instant" variety of Clear Jel� thickens without cooking, but that's not to say you can't use it to thicken something that gets cooked, like a pie.  But if you plan to thicken something, say pie filling, and then preserve it by canning it in jars or freezing it for a long time, it's my understanding that the regular version is the one to use for that. The regular version achieves its thickening in the cooking process, but the instant variety thickens without cooking.<br /><br />Barry Farm Foods has some excellent, detailed information about Clear Jel� on their website - barryfarm(dot com) - where they provide equivalent measurements of Clear Jel� to exchange for other thickeners, and also explain the difference between the regular and instant varieties.<br /><br />King Arthur sells Clear Jel� in an 8-oz. package with their own label, and it's available on their website.  I was able to find it at my local co-operative grocery store, but will get it here in the future, as it's a better deal.<br /><br />If you're concerned about the safety of this "modified" corn starch, "modified" in this case means "pre-cooked" or "pre-gelatanized."  Nothing in the starch has been genetically modified.  Made by National Food Starch, their GMO statement is available to read on their website - briefly, it says they use only non-GM regular (dent) corn products to make this starch.

review/summary: Best thickening agent ever for fruit pies etc.
review/text: I'm so glad that Barry Farm Foods carries this product because it is not an item that I've been able to find at any of my local stores or health food outlets. This is the only thickening agent to use if you don't want separation of liquid from thickened product.  There is no better thickening agent to use for making fruit (especially berry) pies. The pricing on this item is the most reasonable I've found online-- the only caveat being that I find it very aggravating paying the same or more for shipping than the price of the item (like when I order this item). This product is worth it though, so I've ordered it several times.  As the unused Clear Jel seems to last a long time in my dry climate (with no clumping etc.), I usually order 4 lbs. at a time so I don't have to pay the shipping charges very often.

review/summary: Inaccurate Product Information
review/text: This is great stuff. But it's not JUST for cold products. There are two types of Clear Jel, Instant and Regular, and they have different properties.<br />Regular, like normal cornstarch, thickens when heated and in contact with liquid, but it has less flavor and many consider it to produce a better texture. It can be mixed with a small amount of liquid and added to hot sauces or stir fry. It is very stable at room temperature, so it is ideal for canned products, including jams. It can be re-heated, so if a jam or pie filling is the wrong consistency it can be reheated and adjusted with additional water or Clear Jel. Importantly, like regular cornstarch, it breaks down when frozen after thickening. So you can bake with it, you can mix ingredients and freeze it, uncooked, but you can't bake it in a pie, then freeze the pie.<br />For that, Instant Clear Jel is the superstar. Instant thickens as soon as it comes in contact with liquid. To avoid clumping, you mix it with dry ingredients, typically sugar, before adding to the liquid. It holds up well to freezing, but not to re-baking. So it's perfect for thickening uncooked fruit, putting in an unbaked pie crust and freezing. I like it because you know the thickness immediately, and it keeps crusts from getting soggy. You can heat up a piece of pie in the microwave, but you can't bake it, freeze it, and re-bake it . . . and why would you want to? Instant is also great for freezer jam, because you can use fresh berries or peach without having to cook it, so you get a fresher taste. It's not as adjustable as regular, so you have to experiment with small batches to get the texture right, because you can't add in extra to thicken, unless you add it in with more sugar.<br />If you're looking for just a pound and can take advantage of free shipping, Amazon's price is good. If you want a few pounds but less than 5, it is cheaper to go to Barry Farms directly, because their shipping price goes down, but it is built into the price on Amazon.

Well, almost a pound, minus about four tablespoons that I unfortunately tried to use in a home-made marshmallow recipe that called for gelatin.  That did NOT turn out nice.  Yuck!  lol

review/summary: Good value & my Dogs Love it
review/text: I do not know a whole lot about dog food, but I try to avoid corn because I noticed it makes my dogs stink.<br /><br />This very much looks like a quality dog food in its texture, from the ingredients listed, and the fact that it's not bone dry like some of the cheaper dry foods. It reminds me of some of the premium brands in its color, texture, and....this is a bit gross, but the compactness & darker color of what came out of the dogs after they started eating it...!<br /><br />I like it, the dogs are eating it and doing well on it. I will definitely be buying it as their regular dog food from now on. The price is probably better than the other store premium brands because there is no advertising.<br /><br />I recommend it.

review/summary: Great for the dogs coats
review/text: I had to switch my dog's food after the price on their previous food doubled. After doing some research and talking to our vet I bought this brand. One of our dogs has wire hair, so I was suprised after awhile when I noticed his coat was getting shiney and he feels soo soft. The other dog we have is part poodle and she even softer. Which she likes because she likes to be hugged and cuddled. We have had alot of people comment on their nice soft and shiney coats.

If you love this and can't find it, look for Kinder Hippos. The are nearly the exact same thing, but in a hippo shape.

review/summary: Tasty Orange Oil
review/text: My first bottle of orange oil from this producer was a gift.  I did not even open the bottle for several years.  Then I decided to try it in some homemade bubble bath.  The experiment was a failure, but it smelled heavenly.  Since my favorite cream chocolate filling is orange, I decided to try adding a few drops to our microwaved chocolate cake that I make most evenings for a treat.  It's delightful!  I have also been successful in making stir-fried orange chicken using this oil, and I sometimes put a little into hot chocolate.  When the gift bottle was down to only one-third, I started looking on Amazon for a replacement bottle.  In the end, I decided to go with the same brand.  If I could make just one wish about this product, I would like a way to always add drops instead of an uncontrolled dribble.  However, I'd rather have it the way it is than to pay more or get a poorer product.

review/text: I was purchasing this type of cat food for over a year now.  I was paying about $20 for an 18 lb bag each time I bought it.  I ordered it again and much to my surprise, the UPS guy handed me a much smaller box than I was expecting.  I opened it up and there was only a 6 lb bag.  I was wondering if I bought the wrong size or if they sent me the wrong product, but what actually happened is they jacked the price of the 6 lb bag up to the price of the 18 lb bag and discontinued the 18 lb size.  I can't help but feel ripped off, as I would not pay that much for such a small bag of cat food.  Guess I'm off looking for a new brand of cat food now.

It was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating. The licorice was worthless though...

review/summary: Not one but twice came broken.
review/text: I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one.

review/text: The whole idea of a Spongebob Ginger Bread Pineapple is really great, but the sticker that says "Use By" Has a 10 JN 16 date on it. If thats 2010- this is not good! I think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration, but my son is going to want to eat it.  The least the seller could do is to check the expiration date! Its right on the front of the box! Not happy at all!!!

review/text: This was a great buy because this flavor of Trident is getting hard to find in stores. I have no idea why, other than it is my favorite flavor and anything I love seems to disappear LOL. So much more gum for so little compared to buying it one at a time or even in the three pack, IF you can find it anymore. Once again, Amazon has come to the rescue in finding something that seems to be doing a disappearing act on the shelves of the stores around here.

Shipping always kills any online savings elsewhere.  SuperSaver shipping really made the difference.  The agave nectar is excellent quality, no different than bulk Madhava at WF - and arrived sooner than expected, in the jug.  Seriously, they shipped it just like you see it.<br /><br />If you have the space in your house and you use agave, this is the bargain for you.

review/summary: Much better than the Breakfast Bars...
review/text: I found these at my local Super Stop & Shop, 4.99 a box.  I have not seen these at Whole Foods yet. (Note, they are more costly to buy here at Amazon with the additional nearly $9 for shipping).  Anyway, these have a nice peanut and chocolate flavor and my kids prefer them to the EnviroKids Peanut and Choco Drizzle bars.  My only complaint is that these are super small, only 1oz.  So all in all they are expensive but if you need a quick snack then you may want to try these.

review/summary: Not Great, but Better Than Others
review/text: The taste is pretty good, but I was expecting more flavor from a chocolate & peanut bar.  The flavor isn't a turn-off, but it's not strong enough to entice me to buy these on a regular basis.  The density is really good, as is the chewiness.  I found them slightly dry, but the pieces stick together so well, these bars don't leave a mess.  They are a little small, but they tide me over pretty well.  I would recommend people try them to see what they think of the flavor, especially if they're looking for more snack options on a gluten-free diet.

review/summary: Eh, not what I was expecting.
review/text: I bought these at Whole Foods and tried both the chocolate & peanuts and the chocolate & banana, and sadly I didn't like either one. They seemed rather flavorless (or I should say they had flavor, just not enough of it) and quite hard. I tried eating more than just one in hopes that I would maybe get used to them, but in the end I ended up throwing them away. I want to be able to find a type of granola bar that isn't so sugary, but still tastes good (and doesn't feel like I'm chomping down on a brick).<br />I'm giving it a two instead of a one because I've tried other gluten-free foods (mostly cereals and cookies) and I've enjoyed them.<br /><br />To those who like these, continue to enjoy them and don't listen to my rantings. The people who commented first have far better reviews than mine.

review/summary: Perfect for Ice Cream and Popsicles
review/text: Barry Farms is known for their quality and rare, hard-to-find ingredients. Guar Gum is no exception, but anything can be found on Amazon, right? Barry Farms to the rescue!<br /><br />The thickening effect of Guar Gum is similar to gelatin, but the end result is more of a syrup than a jello. Guar Gum has a thickening power nearly 8 times greater than that of corn starch.<br /><br />Many ice creams and popsicles, even Italian ices, call for two main ingredients: Guar Gum (which, being the dietary fiber that it is, has been known to help lower cholesterol) and sometimes Xanthan Gum (also available from Barry Farms: [...]). Both of these gums behave quite differently, and Xanthan Gum can be harder to mix into your liquid solution, but both are effective means to preventing crystallization of liquids, which is how you get softer ice cream and popsicles instead of rock hard ice!<br /><br />Guar Gum can also be used in baked goods to increase dough yield and improves texture and shelf life, in pastry fillings to keep the pastry crust crisp and flaky, in dairy to thicken milk, yogurt, kefir, and liquid cheese products and to maintain homogeneity and texture of ice creams and sherbets, in meat as lubricant and binder, to improve the stability and appearance of salad dressings, barbecue sauces, relishes, ketchups and others dressings/sauces, and even in dry soups, and instant oatmeal mixes.

review/text: Just delighted with this product!  I make popsicles all the time, usually using just fruit juice, or a combo of fruit + juice. Without guar gum the popsicles are still tasty, but the ice crystals are annoying. WITH just a tiny bit of this product -- wow, what a difference!! The bars have no ice crystals at all, and have a creamier consistency. I poured about 3 cups of juice into my blender, and added a scant teaspoon of guar gum, processed it on low for a few seconds; poured it into popsicle molds and my boy friend was ecstatic with the results! Can't wait to add a bit to our homemade ice creams too!

Bread from any type of flour other than wheat (rice, bean, soy, potato, sweet potato, corn, amaranth, quinoa...)refuses to rise during baking.  a spoonful of each added to other flours allows for bread loaves rather than flat cookies like creations.

Just be advised that a little goes a really long way.  My recipie calls for 1 egg, 2 egg yolks, 2 cups cream, 1 cup milk along with some other ingredients and steps.  I added slightly less than 1/8 teaspoon of Guar Gum to my mix as I was tempering the egg mixture.<br /><br />It worked really well - so well that I will likely use a bit less next time depending on what variety I make.  At this rate, this bag will last me several lifetimes!!!

review/summary: Buyers BEWARE!
review/text: I placed an order online with Barry Farms on December 29th.  Their website stated that orders would be processed and shipped within 48 hours or at most 7 days. After my initial order confirmation, I heard nothing from the company about when my order would be shipped. I emailed them to ask about my order on January 9th and was responded to on January 12th (14 days after my order was placed) stating that one of my items was back-ordered. Their website specifically states that they do not hold orders for back-ordered items. I then called the company and told them I needed the items (with or without the backordered items) no later than January 22nd.  They ensured me that it would arrive by then.  I received an email on January 18th informing me that my order had shipped without the backordered items and I would be receiving a refund for the missing items.  However, the package did not arrive on the 22nd as promised, forcing me to purchase the items elsewhere.  I then emailed the merchant and asked for a refund of the shipping charges since they do not accept returns.  I was refused, stating that since the error was with UPS, they were not at fault (even though their website says they ship within 7 days, which they did not, and do not hold for back-ordered items, which they did).  This is unacceptable behavior from any merchant.  I should have been able to return my items for a full refund or at minimum received a refund for the shipping charges.  Now I am out $28 for items I no longer need and cannot use.
