review/text: My dogs LOVE these treats. I plan to continue buying them. A really good value when you buy the 20.4 oz package. Costs you more in the stores per oz, plus the stores usually don't stock the larger size.

review/text: I have a Coton De Tulear (very rare breed). He's got attitude and is incredibly spoiled. He doesn't eat dog food. I cook for him every night. He does however like a few (very few) dog treats. I recently bought him the Pure Bites Cheddar Cheese, because he LOVES cheese. This dog treat is a homerun. My very finicky boy LOVES this treat. ALOT!!! I recommend it highly!

review/summary: Dog Popcorn made my dog go poo
review/text: I'll start off by saying I have a 9 month old Puggle that weighs in at 25lbs. We bought this product at a store at the local mall. Me and my girlfriend thought it would be a great idea, and that one night we could enjoy some popcorn and let the dog enjoy some as well, all while watching a good flick. I let my dog engulf half of the bag. She seemed to love it..<br /><br />Fast Forward to 2am...<br /><br />I am awoken from a deep sleep simply by the stench of poop. I feel my own boxer briefs to make sure I hadn't pooped in my sleep for the first time, Feel around my girlfriend to make sure she didn't poop herself (thank god that wasn't the case), then spot my dog in her crate curled up in the corner... hiding from the horrifying mess she just made (this is the first time she has had diarrhea in the house, and the first time I have had to clean up something of that sort). The smell nearly made me vomit. Even the next day just thinking about the smell made me gag.<br /><br />I vow to never let my dog eat doggie popcorn again. It results in the human equivalent to eating sketchy mexican food.

review/summary: Guilt Free Popcorn
review/text: I think that some people have complained that this popcorn is bland, but that's what it's supposed to be.... It's a product that is as healthy as you want it to be- you decide. :)  Although I do like to add salt, I have found that I don't really care to add a lot of other flavors to it.  This is probably because my mom used to air-pop popcorn when we were kids (and add her own flavors) and it kind of reminds me of that.  I guess she didn't add very much. :)  It seems to "pop" better than other varieties I've tried and it doesn't leave you with greasy fingers.  Good job, Newman.

review/text: This is awesome popcorn. I still prefer air popped popcorn but this is the closest microwave version that I have found, and it's organic. Now, come on and think, if you're looking to tons of butter and salt why would you purchase a 94% fat free unsalted food item. The cool thing is. since it is a fairly plain popcorn (not flavorless just plain) and you want extra flavor you can add just what flavor you're looking for... buttery, cheesy, sweet, spicy or salty. It's a very versatile popcorn.

review/text: Product is as other reviewers note a bit bland and not without some oil.<br />Though the outer package is a nice Newman's Own box, the packages inside are completely generic with a small dot-matrix message "94% fat free unsalted".<br />After 2 purchases that seemed fine, the third is a bust - the popcorn will not pop! Using the same microwaves, after the normal cooking time very few kernals are popped and soon after everything starts to burn. Bag after bag has come out without any popped corn to speak of. With generic packaging and these cooking problems I wonder about the quality of the product.<br />Note that the product is not returnable.

review/summary: Popcorn Organic & Unsalted
review/text: I was so excited to receive this delivery, as my body cannot take the vast amounts of salt in other products.  After the bag popped, I found that the popcorn itself is very light and there are few unpopped kernels at the bottom of the bag. Imagine my surprise to find that unsalted, unbuttered, organic popcorn is very dry and tasteless!  I eat the popcorn because I purchased it, but I really don't enjoy it that much.  Adding a little salt to the popcorn after it has popped does not help at all, because it all falls to the bottom of the bag.  I eat it because I bought it, and I do like the feel of popcorn between my teeth.

review/summary: WARNING: Not Fat-free; not as healthy as you think.  Try Alternatives.
review/text: This product tastes great!  But not without a price.  :-(  I reviewed the label and even though it advertises itself as "no butter", the popcorn still uses plenty of other oils.  Like palm oil which is an all-natural ingredient, but also one of nature's fattiest substances.  It's not as unhealthy as butter, but it's still pretty bad (especially if you're like me and eat 5 servings (the whole bag) in just one sitting).<br /><br />Alternatives:<br /><br />- Orville Redenbacher's "Light Natural" is a better alternative, offering a pleasant taste but with just half as many calories, half the fat, and approximately the same amount of sodium.<br /><br />- Bearito's No Salt/No Oil and Healthy Choice Popcorn are other alternatives, although I don't think they taste as good as Redenbacher's "Light Natural" brand.  (Bearito's and HC Popcorn are also much more expensive; almost twice the price.)<br /><br />I won't be buying anymore of Newman's brand, but I'll definitely be buying more of the alternatives listed above.  :-)

It is, by far, the healthiest and best tasting unsalted, unbuttered popcorn on the market. It is very light and crispy,  making the snacking experience even better. I am on a bland diet, so I probably enjoy the flavor more than someone who is used to using more seasoning on their food. Anyway......

This is just right - low in fat, no salt so we can add seasonings if we choose, and organic to boot. I also feel good about buying Newman's products because of the causes they support and all the money doesn't go to corporate profits.

It is stronger in flavor than the others but I just use less. Some of my favorite uses are mixing it with maple syrup (1 part jasmine 3 parts maple) and pouring it over fresh fruit like strawberries or blueberries or using it as a dip for waffles or pancakes. If you like the other syrups or have ever had rose or violet jelly or candy then I think you will like this syrup as well.

review/text: Monin syrups are obviously of a good quality. They can be found in coffee shops and restaurants all over the country. Most of them are fairly tasty, if not excellent, but this jasmine syrup is one of the worst things I have ever tasted.  It tastes like soap. It literally tastes like soap. I ordered four Monin syrups at once. Lavender was delicious, hibiscus was pretty good, but both jasmine and guava were gross (guava tastes like cough syrup). Please save your money and try another flavor.

review/text: I have used Monin's Lavender syrup and thoroughly enjoyed it, so I decided try another flavor. I have grown jasmine for years and I absolutely love jasmine tea, so this seemed like a good choice. The people at Monin were really off the mark this time. I was very disappointed as I was expecting something similar to jasmine tea flavor. I don't know what this is flavored with, but it does not smell or taste anything like jasmine - at all. It has a rather citrus-like flavor that is not even close. I will continue to experiment with it to try to find a use for it, but I will definitely not purchase this flavor again.

review/summary: incredibly dirty production centers
review/text: The manufacturer of this pate has been shown to run an extremely dirty unhealthy production facility.  They routinely induce liver disease so that the liver is as big as possible<br />and keep the animals caged in their own filth.  The animals are stressed and terrified and release glycogen into their liver which results in an extremely low quality product.<br /><br />Yuck!!!

review/summary: Epicurean Pate!
review/text: Great pate! I eat it all the time. Its great for thickening pasta sauces or spread on ostrich steaks with a lovely honeydew reduction. I find that if I "sun dry" the pate in my tanning bed for a few hours it really brings out the earthy flavors, especially with good Laotian sardines and steamed haricot verts. Give it a try! Best pate for the price!

review/summary: great baby food, fast and easy to prepare
review/text: I grew up in Russia, and of course I was looking for a buckwheat for my baby.<br />This one is currently the only option sold through Amazon that is quick and easy to prepare (just add water or formula). We often prepare it without being fully awake in the morning - no cooking involved.<br />It's good for baby's health and adds to a variety of breakfast and midday snack options.<br />It also tastes great: once my friend saw how eagerly the baby opens his mouth to get it she made a comment: "He is certainly a Russian baby!"<br />Delivery was prompt with cereal boxes adequately protected from any damage. Last but not least - affordable price (I'd still cut it just a bit, though).<br />Wish there were also an option of plain instant buckwheat, without any additions.

review/summary: BEST DOG FOOD
review/text: my poor puppy has been suffering with stomach problems from day one, i have done everything possible to help him out,<br />only time he got better was with bland food, but with my schedule is hard to cook for him everyday, but every dog food in the market we tried, and the poor pup would have diarrhea, this was so frustrating, so many trips to the vet, getting him on antibiotics, we tried the cheap foods because some people told us the high end was too rich, switched to the high end foods like wellness, and still my poor dog would get diarrhea.  i got so frustrated, that i just cooked for him bland foods<br />turkey, rice and potatoes, until i started reading about Buffalo basics, tried it, and in 16 months of having this dog, its the first time he is not with diarrhea, not only that but his fur is incredibly shiny, i'm so happy, and i hope i can help others that have gone thru the same frustration!! it sure is costly but worth getting this than paying a vet!

review/summary: Best food for my sensitive dog!
review/text: For a long time, my dog had "stomach" issues - we initially noticed when he was constantly having to go potty and was always gassy. Since then, we've switched him to various brands of food that had more "pure" ingredients.  Switching over to these premium foods definitely seemed to help - his intestines seemed to be functioning more normally.  However, after months and months of staying on one brand/flavor, he began retching and vomiting every once in a while.  I figured it was possibly the richness of the food so I did a lot of research on food specifically for dogs with sensitive stomachs and came across Blue Buffalo Basics. My dog has been on this food for the past year now and it's been top-notch for him!  No more retching, great BMs and his coat has never been shinier!  And as far as I can tell, he loves it too!

review/summary: Has done wonders for my allergy dog
review/text: We've tried everything from organic dog food to Natural Balance L.I.D. (potato & duck), to finally this brand.  We have a pitbull who seems to be allergic to everything - he gets so miserable during flare-ups, which happens quite often.  We've narrowed down several things he seems to be allergic to including venison, latex toys, and some unknown ingredient ("natural flavors" or canola oil perhaps?) in the Natural Balance dog food.  The latest recall about dog food ingredients sourced from China got me researching - Natural Balance may have their dog food facilities here in the states, but they do not deny they order ingredients from China.  My dog was vomiting his food nearly every day.  I've got two other dogs who didn't, so I thought it was more of an allergy issue than contaminant.  But I don't like taking risks with my dogs.  So, in searching for a dog food with limited ingredients, and a company that sources ingredients from the USA, I ran across Blue Buffalo brand.  I read the ingredients which did not include "natural flavors" or anything else that I thought might be a problem.  One of the ingredients is blueberries, and I figured they dropped in a few berries and mashed it all in with the rest of the food so they could include it on their ingredient list. Imagine my surprise and complete delight when I saw dried blueberries as part of the kibble!  This is awesome - there are truly enough blueberries to add antioxidants and other phytonutrients to their diet.<br /><br />Anyway, within 2 days of feeding this to my pit, his inflamed skin started to heal.  His energy level increased (because he felt good), his coat became very shiny, and he has not vomited once since being on this brand (I feed both dry and canned, as well as supplement with some homemade food).  We've been dealing with his issues for over a year, and this is the first time he seems to have cleared up without the help of medication.  He's been on Blue Buffalo for about a month now.<br /><br />Update:  The "blueberries" may actually be what they call "Life Source Bits" which do include blueberries, but also other ingredients.  In either case, the food has done wonders for my dog.

review/summary: Lifesaver!
review/text: Our 2 1/2 year old Wheaten terrier poodle mix has had problems with her stomach ever since we first got her as a puppy. We have tried every kind of dog food, including the Hill's I/D. We were thinking we were never going to be able to help her with her diarrhea and gas problems. Out of desperation, I bought the Blue Basics at the pet store and I can't say enough good things about it. She has been eating it for 2 months now, and has had normal bowel movements and no gas for the first time in her life. The change was immediate.  I didn't think that would ever happen, and you can tell she just feels so much better. Yes, it's expensive, but in my opinion, it's worth it's weight in gold!

review/text: My Border Collie-Mix, Jackson, has food allergies and I was cooking turkey and oatmeal for him for years.  It was such a relief to find this food.  It is the first dry dog food that my dog could eat without turning pink and itchy and getting hot-spots (staph infections).  It is expensive, but not nearly as much as the Hill's ZD prescription alternative.  And the quality is way better.  My vet even said that Jackson's teeth improved.  He loves it, but to be honest, he would eat anything. I love the cooking freedom and knowing he is getting the right balance of vitamins.

review/text: My 5-month old Golden Retriever puppy had been having chronic diarrhea ever since we brought him home from the breeder.  We took him to various clinics and animal hospitals and they ran their tests for Giardia, etc. but came up with no explanation.  We tried mixing yogurt into his food, which helped a little, but not enough.  Finally we found Blue Buffalo Basics and with a twice-daily enzyme pill called Gentle Digest, he has made a complete turnaround.  He seems so much happier and loves the flavor of the food.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: FINALLY I FOUND THE RIGHT FOOD
review/text: I usually do not get excited about dog food but Blue Buffalo Basics has did the trick for my dog Sonny.  I have a pitbull who I adopted about 6 months ago.  unfortunately, Sonny had Giardia when I adopted him back in April 2012 but after that was resolved about a month or so later. The Wife and I still could not figure out what was still causing his nasty BMs.  On top of the unsightly BMs he started shedding and losing his hair like a maniac.  I was driving myself mad, I couldn't understand what the issue was......I gave him great food (Acana), walked him regularly but for some reason he still had issues. We just assumed we did not get rid of the Giardia the first time or it came back and the vet told us to go one more round with his Giardia medicine.  Still no luck and the same issues, but the final straw was when he scratched himself raw.<br /><br />When we brought Sonny to the vet again to take care of the scratch we did another parasite test.  That test came back clean, the vet proceeded to do other tests to make sure it was nothing serious (The Vet Bills racked up trust me).  We all came to conclusion that he was allergic to either his food or something in the environment..Grass, mold etc......<br /><br />I decided to start off with the food,  I did a mad search through Amazon.com to find a food that was created for Allergies. I came across Blue Buffalo Basic Turkey & Potato as my hail Mary attempt.  It was pricey but I had to try something.<br /><br />Within the first week we can tell his BMs were getting better however not ideal, but by the second week, it was like night and day.  His BMs were awesome, he also was growing his hair back and he was not scratching himself.  This stuff was amazing and I can not believe how much it has helped him.  In addition, he used to have really dry elbows with no hair on them , we assumed this was normal due to sleeping and always rubbing on the floor when lying down.  I am glad to say that he no longer has those dry elbows and the hair is now growing back in that area.<br /><br />I can not say how happy I am with this brand and what it has done for Sonny.  The only thing that would make me happier is if they brought down the price a little bit. However, if it keeps Sonny healthy I have no problem ponying up the extra cash.<br /><br />If you have a dog that you believe has allergies, try this brand before you spend a fortune like I did at the vet.

review/text: Our dog Cooper was a rescue whippet/border collie mix that had only been fed cheap food. His coat was dry and covered in dandruff. He also had a problem with vomiting. He would vomit 5-6 times a day. He would be acting normal and then just randomly vomit. It was usually just bile but obviously we wanted to stop it. As soon as we adopted him we started him on IAMs naturals hoping to help his problems. Unfortunately, not only did he not like the taste of IAMs but the dandruff and vomiting continued. After waiting a few months we then tried Blue Buffalo for sensitive stomachs. It has been a miracle! He no longer vomits, his fur is in great shape and he loves the taste! I couldn't be happier!!!

review/text: I have been searching for a wet food that is both healthy for my 9-month-old kitty and also satisfies his picky palate. My cat really dislikes the classic pate style wet cat food, which unfortunately seems to be the style of most wet food out there. He definitely prefers the sliced (which I can't really blame him for - most pate style wet food looks gross to me too). I'm so glad I discovered that Blue Buffalo offers a sliced option! He loves both the sliced chicken and sliced turkey, so I ordered both to give him a little variety. I only wish Blue Buffalo offered a sliced beef or maybe a sliced fish option too! I would get them all.<br /><br />I love that I can recognize the ingredients that go into making this food, and if there happens to be any ingredient that I don't immediately recognize I can always check out Blue Buffalo's website for a clear explanation of what each ingredient is: [...]<br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: They're good, but I like the milk chocolate version better
review/text: A regular bounty bars consist of a soft, almost molten center of sweet coconut coated in an outer layer of milk chocolate. This version is pretty well identical, except they use dark chocolate.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer the milk chocolate version. I just think the "softer" flavor of the milk chocolate complements the coconut's taste and texture better. But... well, maybe that's just me! Obviously you have to make your own call.<br /><br />Note that here on Amazon you can purchase bounty bars of both types in packages of varying number. So it is worth your while to crunch the numbers and think about what package offers the best value for you. At the same time, it may not be entirely in the best interests of your health to have _too_ many of these things lying around at home all at once.<br /><br />Enjoy in moderation! ;)<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: 4 cats and none would eat it
review/text: We have 4 cats who pretty much eat anything. Not one of them would eat this! I noticed they were particularly eager for their canned food in the morning, and then I realized one cat had lost substantial weight before it occurred to me to check their dry cat food bowl (which my older children are responsible for). I kept an eye on the bowl and figured out it wasn't going down. I dumped it out and replaced it with fresh and even though they were really hungry they wouldn't eat it. I ended up throwing away the whole bag and going back to whatever is on sale at the store.

review/summary: Slowly Smoked Pork is Delicious
review/text: I buy Karaj Hungarian Pork Loin regularly at our local Hungarian grocer, and have found it delicious. It serves well as a quick snack, or as a sandwich fixing (with a little mustard or light BBQ sauce).<br /><br />Imagine the aroma of a nearby campfire, after pork has lingered on the grill, but not burnt. Somehow, that flavor, through careful smoking and salting, is infused into the Karaj Hungarian Pork Loin.<br /><br />I prefer it in thin slices, eaten cool, but it is also an ingredient in various Hungarian soups. It isn't spicy even though it is packed with taste. Fans of BBQ joints and smokehouse steakhouses with find the flavor familiar.<br /><br />It keeps around six months unopened. I fully recommend the Karaj Hungarian Pork Loin.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com

review/summary: kitties love it..
review/text: I recently adopted two stray kittens. It had been a long time since I had a kitten so I began researching websites like littlebigcat.com learning what is best to feed kittens and cats.  I was surprised to learn that dry food is terrible for kittens/cats and in fact may cause many of the health problems that cats face later in life.  I also learned that kittens/cats need a high protein diet for life.  Carbos are very bad for them.  Kittens/cats should get most of their moisture from their food. Merrick food provides a moisture content of 78%.  In the past, I fed my cats dry food. They drank a lot of water, they got fat, and they always seemed hungry.  My veterinarian supports the Merrick brand name. My kitties are growing, are happy...not always looking for more food, and they are not going to be overweight.  Do your homework. Read about the latest research.

review/text: In my mind I was thinking the short stacks canisters, you know those short ones about half the size of the regular pringles can.  But I was wrong, this is the snack pack size. These are quite small. I counted about 12 chips per container. I paid $17 for this. I doubt I'd buy it again at that price. The chips were good, but way too few of them. Good for small kids lunchboxes maybe.

review/text: Love potato chips but I can't stand the fact that they can go stale so fast once they've been open.  I used to have packages on top of the refrigerator with 2 handfuls of chips in them even though they had been resealed, clipped and re-clipped.  We had seen the 6 pack of regular Pringles in the store and started purchasing them.  Couldn't find the assorted flavors until I went to Amazon (in this day and age of gas prices, I go there quite often rather than drive around to many stores).  Love the assorted packs, Thank you Amazon.

There are regular, cheddar cheese, and sour cream and onion. My friend was so pleased with the product that he wanted a package for himself. I am on my second box and I am thrilled! They come 36 in a box so they last a good long time. I highly recommend them.

review/text: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! First of all, I did not receive what I ordered, which was 36 count variety pack. I received 32 count plain flavor chips. Amazon was great though, they refunded me my money. Secondly, you get about 1.8 lbs of chips for $19.00, and it sounded like some of the chips were broken when I took them out of the box, which I know happens. You get about 12 chips per little container, x 32 containers = 384 chips, divided by $19, you are paying about 5 cents per chip!!!That makes for some extremely overpriced packaging, and broken chips. Save your money, buy a container to put them in rather than pay for this. Buy local generic. Just as good. These sellers of this product need to drop their price!

Yesterday I received an email telling me that the product will not be shipped until May 17 and will not be at my door until May 24.  And yet it's taken them over a week to even inform me of this.  Bad business practice if you ask me.<br /><br />First, I LOVE this tea.  Best green tea you can buy.  I have nothing but rave reviews about the tea.  Sadly, due to the name and people thinking it's a 'Mexican' brand of tea it was not a big seller in area stores and everyone stopped carrying it.  I have had to find a place online to order.  Well, I can say that the next time I have to order I will be finding someone else to get it through.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed in the shipping. :(

Either TreeTop or Motts are the best brands, in our opinion. Lately, we've found another use. We use them with our one-year-old baby. He loves applesauce! It needs no fridge and has a long shelf life. A small tub is about the right size for a feeding. How convenient. Our boy likes the plain and cinnamon equally well. Our family consumption has gone up markedly and these mega-packs suite our needs well.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
