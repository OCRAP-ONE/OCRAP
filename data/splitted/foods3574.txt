review/text: It was packaged tight in a bubble envelope.  They taste fresh and have some minimal breakage of the wafers, which was to be expected.  Overall, the cost to me is high, but when you can't find them in the stores and its your favorite all time candy, its worth it.  I gave them to my mom for Christmas and she was so happy, we have been looking for them in the stores for a long time.

review/summary: Like macaroons--chewy, VERY sweet, kinda expensive, but nice with coffee or tea for a non-full-of-processed stuff treat...
review/text: Just got my order today for one bag each of the Tropical (these) for me (I like coconut) and the original (which I thought my hubby would prefer).<br /><br />The cookie: It's kinda small. 2 inches in diameter. (Yes, I got a ruler and measured). Very sweet. I know another reviewer said they weren't sweet, but man, I got a lot of honey impact in my taste test. Very chewy. Coconutty. Not fully a macaroon, there is some sort of undertaste, but very mararoony.<br /><br />Price: Why are 12  cookies 10 bucks? I dunno. BUT..I'll pay it for an occasional cookie-ish treat that's not full of preservatives and weird chemicals.<br /><br />I wish they had one that was all out choco-coconut (like the mounds taste of cookie) or almondy-coconut, without spices and add-ons like the Alpine. I think that would suit me even better. I hope they expand to a more choco type cookie in future.<br /><br />I'm ordering more, as hubby liked the original flavor and I think my sister will like this one (tropical).  The three stars is a combo of plusses for ingredients, pleasantness (though not particularly whoopsie-do fabulosity in taste) and individual wrapping (that preserves freshness and makes these lunch-box friendly), and minuses for the excess honey (way too sweet) and price point. Once you take the shipping into account, it's more than one buck for a 2 inch cookie.<br /><br />Shipping was pretty swift. I got it 6 days from my ordering (and that included the weekend). Stuff arrived fresh.. Thumbs up for that. :D

review/text: I am no stranger to health foods and even use almond flour often.  I don't know what I was expecting but these have a strange consistency and flavor.  They are gummy and hard to chew which makes you think they have a lot of honey -- yet they are strangely NOT sweet.  It's like an unsweetened granola bar.  I am not a fan.  They sent a sample of the carob cookie which I thought was nice but we didn't care for that one either.  Maybe it's just not our bag.

We've bought them off Amazon and directly off the company's website, and have had very pleasant experiences with both.

review/summary: The best oil for popping corn!
review/text: This popcorn oil is the best for popping corn anywhere.  I have used it at home in my PopStir (similar to WhirleyPop) on the stovetop and at school functions in a commercial popcorn popper. If you use this oil, you probably won't even have to add any butter to the popcorn after it's popped - so no cholesterol and less fat.  A special feature of this product: It will NOT form black "varnish" inside or outside of your kettle - be it a commercial machine or a home version - it is a clean oil.  This oil is solid at room temperature, and you will need some sort of scoop (as an ice cream or cookie scoop) to measure it out of the container.  This oil gives popcorn the fragrance, taste and COLOR of commercially popped theater popcorn. You won't regret your purchase of this item.

Instructions with a table showing the proper ratios for popcorn, popping oil and seasoning would have been helpful!!  It is far better than Orville's "butter popping oil".  The shipping cost was about half the cost of the oil so it would have also been nice to have this as a "free shipping item" even if it would have to be combined with other items.

review/summary: Tasty but too expensive for the volume you receive.
review/text: I purchased this for my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R">West Bend 82306X Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a> that I received at Christmas.  Originally I had one jar that my GF purchased with the popper.  I ended up buying the 3 pack once we had run through the single jar.  This oil is quite good.  It has a very buttery flavor to it and pops kernels just fine.  In its solid form in the jar it smells like an old movie theater from childhood.  Ive since purchasing this item really gotten into popcorn and ive smelled popping oil that had no odor to rancid odors but this product smells great and tastes great as well.  What I ended up doing since the bottle is a crazy shape is to stick it in the microwave and melt it so I could pour the liquid oil easily into the Stir Crazy.  Don't worry it turns solid again.  My only qualm with this is the price.  You can purchase <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YLI9E2">Paragon Coconut Popcorn Popping Oil (Gallon)</a> for the same price and receive 128oz of oil versus 48 of the Wabash Valley.  If the seller took half off the price it still wouldn't be as good of a deal as the Paragon.  That being said I did purchase the three pack and did enjoy it immensely.  Tasty but expensive.

review/summary: Excellent product, but.....
review/text: EXCELLENT PRODUCT!! I've tried several different brands of various so-called "popcorn oils" over the years, including one marketed by the elderly gentleman who we all know and love for his popcorn, all of which seem to be made of soybean, canola, or something even worse, and which, quite frankly, taste as bad as they sound. None of them even come close when compared to coconut oil, either taste-wise or healthwise - yes, I said healthwise,check it out - and this "Real Theater" brand of flavored coconut oil is without question the best my wife and I have ever used. We own an old-fashioned movie theater style popcorn maker, so I can't vouch for popcorn made on the stove, but there's no reason why there should be any difference in flavor no matter how it is made. Please remember that this is coconut oil, and unlike other oils, it will tend to solidify at ambient temperatures of maybe 70 degrees F or cooler. The product label doesn't explain this for some reason, but it's a natural occurrence for coconut oil. Anyway, you can simply scoop out the amount of oil you need, but I suggest placing the container in some luke-warm water until the oil returns to a fully liquid state - maybe 5 minutes or less, and then pour out the amount needed. It doesn't need to be refrigerated after it's opened, and has a virtually unlimited shelf life.<br />The "but" in the title line refers to problems we had with the vendor when it came to our shipment, but this is after all a product review, not a customer service critique.

Always the same.<br /><br />The popcorn made with this oil (and Flavacol salt) was fine popcorn, good even, but it was not anything even close to movie theater popcorn.<br /><br />Maybe "movie theater popcorn" varies depending where you live?

review/text: This is what you are looking for!  This Wabash Valley product always provides the rich aroma and buttery taste of the best theater pop corn.  A wonderful experience from the clatter of the kernels falling into the pan through the last of their buttery crunch.  Mouthwatering.  When I use this I get enough buttery taste on the popcorn that I do not add futher buttery product.  I do include Flavacol brand popcorn salt in the popping process.  Good munching..  - -  As a comparison, I recently used Reddenbacher's Popping Oil & Topping.  Reddenbacher's is decidedly watery and tasteless.  Many fewer kernels popped - as in Many Fewer - and when I tried for a more complete result the bottom of my Whirly-Pop was discolored/burnt.  - -  Go with Wabash Valley.  Man, this stuff is good..

review/text: I got a bottle/jar of this stuff.<br />Tried it over a month with my three kids (20 month boy, 3 y/o girl & 5 y/o boy) and my wife and I (no ages given :-) ) We watch a family movie together 1x to sometimes 2x a week depending on homework and schedules.<br /><br />It worked, but so did vegetable oil. The reports about not causing dark stains in popper hopper, that could be true. I don't see any new ones added but there where already some since we used Veg. Oil for a few months before we tried this product.<br />I use a pop corn maker similar to this one, but I got it at a members box store. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DUCCEM">Maxi-Matic EPM-250 Elite Tabletop Retro-Style 2-1/2-Ounce Kettle Popcorn Popper Machine</a><br /><br />Now, it is a small pop corn hopper, 2.5oz to 3oz, which maybe the reason for this, but none of us tasted any buttery flavor or saw any yellow coloring as some reviewers have stated (but the manufacturer doesn't so cant ding them for that.) It could be the hopper is to small and the popped kernels are ejected out to soon to get any of the flavoring/coloring from oil.<br /><br />Now I am not complaining that this product doesn't work, it does just fine, just that so does other cheaper oils and my family didn't notice a difference.  So once this jar is used up, will stick with Veg Oil. Might experiment with peanut oil to see how that might work.

review/summary: this is a realllllllllly good popping oil
review/text: We really enjoy this popping oil.  We have been looking for a really good theater popping oil and have finally found it.  You won't go wrong with this oil and the company is a delight to work with.  We had a problem with the packaging of the oil as the lid and safety seal were broken during shipping and the company was curteous and promptly replaced the broken package without a problem.  I was and am very happy with the product and the company. I will deffinately do business with them again.

review/summary: Just like in the movie theater, and I should know!
review/text: When I was much younger I actually popped popcorn for a living! I did this job for United Artists and General Cinema. When this oil first hit my hot pan the smell of it uncovered surprisingly intense memories of that crazy high school job working with my friends. Beyond the smell, the oil performed very well - it was easy to get consistent batches of popcorn without being too fiddly with temperature, timing, or other problematic issues typical of making movie theater popcorn without movie theater equipment.<br /><br />This oil solidifies when it gets cold, and in our use on a camping trip I did have to immerse the container in some warm water to loosen it up - which unfortunately misshaped the plastic container, but I understand if anyone out there sees this as a fringe issue.<br /><br />On quantity, I popped about 12 pounds of popcorn with 3 of the 16-oz jars. Your mileage may vary, but ordering these small containers is a much better deal than getting a gallon of oil that will just sit around.<br /><br />All around, I highly recommend this product and will order it again.

review/text: Paired this with the Mushroom kernel popcorn popped out of a "movie theater" style popper in our office.  What a difference this stuff makes!!  I found warming a metal spoon under warm water or even the heating element of the popocorn machine helped with scooping the emulsion out of the jar and having it "Release" from the spoon.  Once warm it just melts like regular oil.<br />Very pleased!!

I use a electric popcorn stirring popper and have tried the oils you can find in the super markets and it never cam out like the theater popcorn.  I recently found a product called flavacol its a popcorn salt and it helped alot but once I got this oil and used it along with the flavacol and the popcorn tastes JUST like movie theater popcorn now.  I like it so much that I am on a automatic re-order program for this oil... HIGHLY recomend

review/text: I bought this along with the flavacol seasoning salt and just got it in today. I think this is BETTER then any theater popcorn around here. I added way to much flavaol salt though so it was a bit salty but still really good. Like most of the other reveiws I will say that it is a bit difficult getting the oil out because it is solid but it made my popcorn taste so good, Def worth buying.<br />IT is a bit expensive for 3 16-ounce jars but it is the best thing i have ever bought! Will def buy this again when I run out. IF you want it just like the theater dont forget to get your Flavacol seasoning salt! :)

review/summary: Makes for the best popcorn EVER!!!
review/text: Ok so I bought this product because I have been really wanting to make movie theater style popcorn at home for a while now.  At first I started making popcorn without knowing or reading up on anything, so I bought an electronic popcorn popper and just tried making popcorn with cooking oil.  My popcorn turned out pretty bad for a long time until I did more research and found that the secret to making movie theater popcorn is in the oil you use.  That being said this coconut based oil has made a world of difference in the popcorn that I make.  Now when I make popcorn using this oil, I even get the smell of movie theater style popcorn!!  Everyone I've made popcorn for comments on how good it is and that it tastes just like going to the movies!<br /><br />As a side note, I also bought these things to go along with this oil.  Combined all together and you'll get some serious movie theater popcorn!<br /><br />- Gold Medal Products 2045 Flavacol Seasoning Popcorn Salt (great for adding that buttery/salt flavor... you don't need to add a lot, just a light sprinkle will do)<br />- Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper (essential for making good popcorn is a stove top cooker... much, much better than the electronic one I had and tons easier to clean)<br />- Odell's Original Popcorn Butter, 10-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 3) (ever wonder what was in the movie theater butter dispensers??? well I'm sure the stuff at the theaters has extra stuff in it but this is essentially what it is, clarified butter... anyway, it makes your popcorn have that buttery taste to it that you get at the theaters when you use the butter dispenser)

review/summary: Good, but not what I was looking for
review/text: When I purchased the popcorn oil, I was hoping to be able to do away with adding extra butter/butter flavored topping to my homemade popcorn. While the product performed well, the popcorn was colored a bit and tasted fine, I found that using just the Real Theater oil was not enough flavoring for my taste. There is nothing wrong with this product, it's just not for me and I won't be buying it again. I, for one, am sticking with using a decent quality, store-bought vegetable oil, good quality unpopped kernels and I'm going to order the butter flavored popcorn topping offered here at Amazon that comes from the same supplier as this popping oil. I've purchased the topping before, it's very good and for me, it's the way to go. I'm rating the oil 3 stars because it's a fine product, just not what I has wishing it to be.

review/summary: My dog's favorite rawhide
review/text: My dog (A silken windhound) loves any and all rawhide, any and all bones to be truthful. But she injured a tooth once cracking through a beef knuckle bone, and I have since stopped providing her with hard bones. My dog has no interest at all in toys, unless there is a treat in it, then she pulls out the treat in 5 minutes and ignores the toy from then on. So I sought out rawhides as something to engage her off and on during the day. Though she'll chew eagerly on any rawhide I give her, I worry about her choking or gagging on a large hunk of it stuck in her throat, or a large piece getting stuck in her gut. This piggy twist, because it has such tight skinny strands, does not have that risk. On top of that,she'll take nearly two weeks of picking at it to finally finish it off, in spite of her persistance. I am so glad that she can have the rawhide she enjoys, that it doesn't get devoured in a day, and which allows me to feel safe giving it to her. I do wish I could get the 9 inch in a 3-5 pack.

review/summary: Great Product for a Limited Audience
review/text: This is not a weight loss product and it's not for the casual athlete; the shake's target audience is the kind of person who needs to ingest 400 quick calories and continue their workout.  Most average people are happy if they actually burn 400 calories in a session, so drinking this shake would negate any grueling gains made atop an elliptical machine.<br /><br />Pro athletes, marathon runners, weekend warriors.  These are the kind of people who'll benefit from Gatorade's new products.  Those trying to gain weight will also see results, as the nutrition is almost the same as drinking a slim-fast and eating a protein bar at the same time.  The 40/20/8 ratio of carbs/protein/fat closely mirrors the suggested standards of many weight loss programs but will be off limits for anyone on a low carb diet.<br /><br />The most obvious benefit to the high calories is the taste.  This is one yummy shake and one that few people would identify as "healthy".  Of course, if the average person consumes this product without exerting a tremendous amount of effort in the gym, they won't consider the pounds they pack on as an improvement in their health.

review/text: I really like these Gatorade nutrition shakes. The Strawberry flavor is not quite as good as the vanilla in my opinion, but both have the same nutritional content, so that's purely a preference and has nothing to do with the quality of the shake. I view these as more meal replacement shakes than traditional protein shakes. They have a quality portion of protein (20g) but they're not intended to be pure protein shakes for a body builder. They taste good, are reasonably filling, and can give you a boost of energy after a good workout or between meals when you're tempted to eat things you'll regret later. I keep some at my office for just that purpose!<br /><br />The can is made of steel not aluminum which means that the can will not accidentally open or get punctured if you let it kick around in your gym bag.

review/summary: For a casual snack, filler, this suits me!
review/text: For decades, Gatorade is synonomous with sports, athletes, performance, health, hydration and nutrients and vitamins. If your intention is to use it as a higher level like sports training, performance, endurance, energy, etc., then this is the product for you. If your level is for just fitness and exercise, then this can only be a great enhancement.<br /><br />The shakes provided by Gatorade are not thick, so it's not quite the "shake" feel, athough it is very tasty being that it is specially made for athletes, etc.<br /><br />For me, interested in only fitness and exercise, I will maximize with the protein benefit as a quick meal enhancement. I like the low gram of fat, and no trans fat. For others who need the specified amount of nutrients, this is sufficient.<br /><br />My intention is not to supplment my health such as an experienced athlete, but this strawberry is tasty, just like the vanilla.  I like it cold, but it is fine not being that cold.<br /><br />For the serious athlete, the ingredients may work for you....for the casual snack and protein benefit, I can enjoy it.  Rizzo

So because of that awful experience, I vowed to never again drink nutritional shakes.  Then Amazon came along and offered a free sample to review. I still was reluctant but decided to face my fear. Plus, I really need to get back into shape again :) The fact that it was called a "shake" and not a "protein drink" made me more hopeful. So, when I finally took my first swig of it today I was pleasantly surprised. Yeah, it actually tastes good... not to be confused with "bearable". It actually tastes like a nice strawberry smoothy.<br /><br />Now, I don't know exactly how good it is for you... since it tastes so good. So I can't comment on it's actual "nutritional value".  Oh, by the way, I drank the strawberry flavored one. So I don't know how good the other flavors are yet. One last thing to keep in mind is that it does contain Milk protein.. so if you're lactose intolerant, you may want to drink something else.  It also means you have to refrigerate it after opening.  I hope this review was helpful... bottoms up! :)

review/summary: Taste and Nutrition for Athletes
review/text: First off, I'm no athlete. But when rushed for time, I like to grab a light, quick meal before I power walk (keeps me going). So I tried this shake, in the strawberry flavor.<br /><br />Taste wise, the flavor was okay. Yes, I tasted strawberry, but not a natural fruit taste (then again the can SAYS "artificial flavor"). Still, there was no "yuck-factor" at all.<br /><br />Second, the nutrient value listed was pretty high in all the stuff that is supposed to energize before or repair after a workout. (Such as 56g of carbs, 580mg of potassium, 20g of sodium.)<br />Will those amounts of nutrients do the trick? You'll have to wait for a review from a real athlete to know for sure!<br /><br />For me, the bottom line was: taste was okay, and I didn't feel hungry or fatigued after my 2 mile walk. Could have been the power of suggestion, then again, it could have been the boost from this shake.<br />Worth a try, I think, for any serious athlete.

review/summary: Athletes must need way less nutrition than I do
review/text: Hey, I'm just a middle aged guy who by disciplining his food intake and hitting the treadmill every day is trying not to become a big fat bloated parody of himself and maybe live a little longer too.<br /><br />I drink a lot of nutritional "shake" canned beverages.  I want to stay slim, but sometimes I need to eat fast.  I thought I'd compare the nutritional content of my canned shake of choice with the nutrition that this shake provides to athletes.<br /><br />My shake of choice lists 23 items in the nutritional table at the bottom.  This product lists 15 items.  In cases where both nutrients appeared in the table, my shake had more of those nutrients than this one, with the exception of Vitamin C, where they both had 100 percent.<br /><br />My shake has 10 grams of protein, and this shake has 20 grams.  Score one for Gatorade!  Both shakes have about the same amount of potassium.  My shake has 23 grams of carbs including 5 grams of fiber.  The Gatorade shake has 56 grams of carbs.<br /><br />So, I must conclude that athletes need way more sugar than I do, and way less vitamins.  Oh yeah, both cans contain exactly the same amount of product.<br /><br />Finally, there's something creepy to me about marketing a "shake" in a dark green can.  Ever had any kind of "shake" that was dark green?  Remember all those algae shakes you had when you were a kid?  Well, neither do I.

review/text: One of the items I picked up on my latest visit to my local Costco Warehouse store was a huge 2.5 pound can of Kirkland Signature Super Extra-Large Virginia Peanuts. I've never seen such a large can. These ought to last a while! Plus the can has a replaceable top to help preserve freshness.<br /><br />The peanuts are lightly roasted and lightly salted. They are completely devoid of their skins. Good crunchyness. Good flavor, if slightly somewhat bland. It's a good buy for me in that I've cut down on meats and other animal products as a matter of health and peanuts have no animal fats nor cholesterol, yet offer a good protein component to the diet.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: A special marmalade for special tastes
review/text: After all these years, Frank Cooper and Co. still make the most wonderful marmalades in the world. That, of course, is very much an individual opinion. Cooper's Oxford marmalades, some of which are aged like good hams, are less sweet than those one is likely to find in an American supermarket. They're also made from Sicilian blood oranges which are more bitter than those species more commonly used for this purpose. It seems  a near miracle to me that it's possible to buy Frank Cooper marmalades in the U.S., but since I'm very partial to them, I give the seller high points for offering them to the market. On the subject of the shipper, let me add that my marmalades have arrived swathed in bubble wrap like a precious Egyptian mummy being  shipped between museums. I'm sorry that the shipper is as slow as it regularly seems to be. That's a minor complaint, I realize, but it's important enough to me to have docked a  star.

review/summary: Excellent tea blend
review/text: This is a wonderfully smooth, full bodied tea. It is without the bitterness some other breakfast teas seem to have. We found a tea blend (Assam, Ceylon & African teas)  in a small tea shop in Bath,UK and have been looking for something similar since we are back in the states. This tea is very much like the one we had in Bath. Taylors of Harrogate Scottish Breakfast tea is fast becoming on of my favorite morning teas. I drink mine with Splenda and creamer and others at the breakfast table drink it with sugar only or just plain and we all like it.<br /><br />I recommend the Scottish Breakfast tea without reservation. Prior to finding this tea we have been having Barry's Irish Breakfast tea or Yorkshire Gold but this, in my opinion, a much better tasting tea.  The price on Amazon is very reasonable and coupled with free shipping there is no reason not to try it.

review/text: My wife, who is a prolific tea drinker, has sampled many what she calls "regular black tea".  That is, she's not a big fan of the more exotic blends that offer supplemental tastes or aromas.  For years, the TofH Scottish Brakfast Tea has been her favorite and is a regular purchase of mine when I'm stuck for an anniversary or holiday gift.  Years ago, it was difficult to find for reasonable prices.  Since Amazon started carrying it, I've ceased shopping anywhere else.  Last time, however, I think it was offered in 100 count boxes which I prefer.  I was tempted to rate it only four stars for that reason, but didn't, since it's about the quality, not the quantity.

review/text: Taylors of Harrogate's Scottish Breakfast Tea isn't just for breakfast! It's great with meals,  snacks, and great hot or iced. It is a very hearty tea, with a robust blend of flavors that go well with a wide variety of foods.<br />Scottish Breakfast Tea seems to pack a pretty good caffeine punch for me. I like the no-tag teabags that brew more than one 6-oz. cup, too. I can generally brew a gallon pitcher of iced tea on 6 bags, and I like my iced tea as dark as strong coffee.<br />I started ordering Scottish Breakfast Tea from Amazon when our local stores stopped carrying it. Amazon's prices are better anyway, and you can't beat their shipping time. I have my new favorite tea ready all the time now.<br />Thanks, Taylors of Harrogate! Thanks, Amazon!

The 6 boxes of 50 may last her the whole year (as she is not as big of a consumer of tea as I am).  This makes the perfect work place present as well for the tea snob.  Taylors of Harrogate make a wonderful product line and we have tried pretty much all of them.  The hearty flavor of the whole line of breakfast teas appeals to many and especially to my wife & I. The Irish Breakfast <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F42ECI">Taylors of Harrogate Irish Breakfast Tea, 50-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>is a close second. I on the other hand have a box of Yorkshire Gold <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XEV9YE">Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, 160-Count Tea Bags</a>that I have yet to open.  So if you love good tea, I can easily suggest that you purchase tea from an area famous for tea makers going back centuries.  If your search of the local supermarket has left you with few good choices, then this option is perfect for you - have the tea come to you.  I am telling you as someone who has bungled presents in the past, this is the way to go.

I'm such a junk-food-aholic at night so I drink a cup or two after dinner and late at night and have NO desire to shove candy bars and cupcakes down my throat.

review/text: How delicious!  This is definitely not for someone who thinks they're buying hot chocolate.  This a very tasty "choffee" beverage, and only 10 calories per 6oz for anyone who keeps track.  It is bitter since it is roasted/ground cocoa beans, but you can add sugar or creamer according to taste (or none at all!).  I like it with a pinch of stevia.  The berry flavor is definitely prominent.  When I have a cup in the morning it definitely feels too good to be breakfast!  It's decadent, rich and satisfying. I was never a chocolate coffee fan, and since this is completely different it's something to really be enjoyed.  It's light in color which is normal, and sometimes has a slightly oily appearance in the cup.  Completely normal and does not take away from the taste!  I am really excited to try out the other Crio Bru flavors like Cavalla and Cocoa River.  Since this is so satisfying, I cant see myself ever going back to hot chocolate again!  It has it's own unique flavor and aroma that really can only be described as "brewed cocoa beans."  I'd recommend this to any chocolate or hot beverage lover.

review/summary: One of my favorite pet products
review/text: I first received the scented bags as a "bonus" with my regular bags.  I loved them so much that I was bummed when I had to switch to the "regular" ones I actually bought.  The scent is very strong, but not to the point where it's offensive in its own right, but is strong enough to mask the unpleasant smells the bags contend with.  I didn't have the other reviewer's problem- the scent remained for as long as I had the bags, and even made my "regular" bags smell good to an extent.<br /><br />Even more importantly- this is the only brand of bags I use.  I've tried others, and I've had breakage or size problems.  These are perfect.  They've never broken, and they're the perfect length for easy, clean tying.  I love them.

review/summary: These bags are short now, too!
review/text: I had been buying the scented bags for the past several months because they were longer than the unscented bags (the unscented bags used to be longer, too).  Unfortunately, Bags on Board has gotten cheap with all of their bags now, as the last batch of scented bags is now shorter, too.  Too bad.  It used to be a 5-star product for me, now only 4 stars.  Note to manufacturer - please go back to the original, longer bags.

review/summary: Scented bags make a long walk MUCH more enjoyable!
review/text: These bags are easy to use and I have them attatched to my dog's leash for easy access.  They arrived quickly, were sold at a good price and are exactly as promised.  The fact that they have a  plesant although mild scent makes my multi-mile walks much more enjoyable!  The fact that they're biodegradable a huge added bonus!  I will order again and again.

review/summary: Great, convenient product
review/text: It is a poop bag on a roll.  what else is there to say?  They are convenient and thick enough that they doe not tear.

review/summary: Bigger bag
review/text: Pleasant smell, but that is subjective.  The 5 star rating is based on the fact that these bags are about an inch longer than the standard blue or the bright colored bags, PLUS plastic seems slightly heavier.  Will buy again.  Fragrance helps not make the garbage can unbearable.

review/summary: Good poop bags.
review/text: I enjoy using these bags.  I have a dog training book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446675385">Good Owners, Great Dogs</a>) with a picture of a dog pooping, and the caption says: "To those of you who do not have housebreaking problems with your pet, this picture may seem a bit crass. But for those of you who have struggled with this particular behavior, a dog doing his business outside is a thing of beauty and a joy forever." Well, I think of this whenever I unfurl one of these bags.  My rescue dog may have came with all sorts of training issues, but bless her, she is perfectly house trained.<br /><br />The bags are a decent size, wide enough to encompass the target. They are long enough to tie with enough clean part at the top, but would be even nicer if they were a bit longer. They are occasionally hard to open. Each roll is approx. 2.25 inches wide and 1.25 inches thick, including a plastic core which seems unnecessary to me.  I don't have a Bags on Board brand dispenser but they fit into a dispenser purchased at Pet Food Express. The bags are printed so you can see where to tear, which is nice. The "Ocean Mist" scent is not what I would call a "fresh, clean fragrance" - a bit cloying and sweet - but it does help mask that other fresh fresh fragrance. The bags are a pretty color but the contents do show through a bit.<br /><br />All in all, these bags are a worthy buy. I will no longer risk the horror of grocery store plastic bags that sometimes have holes in them.

review/summary: Love the scent.
review/text: The quality of these bags are great.  They are strong, large and have a refreshing scent.  Don't know if paying the extra $4.00 is worth to get the scent though.
