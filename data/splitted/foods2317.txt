review/summary: Good alternative to saltine crackers and white bread
review/text: If you want to try something other than common staples like saltine crackers and white bread, consider something like Leksands.<br /><br />Its rough appearance can be deceiving.  It is suprisingly smooth.  (There are rougher and crunchier crispbreads around, but Leksands is not one of them.)<br /><br />On its own, it may taste rather bland.  However, it is very versatile with most other dishes.  It can be eaten with soups, salads, meat, fish, egg, and cheese.  I even tried it out with masago (processed roe of the capelin)!<br /><br />Because it is dry, it lends itself well to be included in a lunch box.<br /><br />Only one problem is that, because it is dry and crunchy, it leaves small particles of crumbs all over the place.

review/summary: Relax without having to break the Rounds
review/text: I have been buying the large package of Rounds from Leksands and breaking them into sixths which is a serving. This is already pre-broken into serving sizes. I was concerned that the bread woiuld be pulverized by the Post Office but at least this time it did not happen, though a few pieces were slightly cracked. Overall the pieces were much more cleanly broken that what I am able to do by hand.<br /><br />The freshness of the product is perfect! I will probably be buying 3 - 4 times per year (which allows for reduced pricing)as being of Scandanavian heritage, we use it instead of crakers for most things.

review/summary: Perfect for Breakfast and Midday Snack
review/text: I was first introduced to crispbread when I lived in Finland as an exchange student.<br />I used to eat crispbread everyday at lunch time. The taste of it brought me back to the lunch time in Finland.<br /><br />I recommend Leksands' crispbreads, not only because of my sentimental value, buy because they taste good (I love how I can keep getting flavor as I keep munching).<br /><br />I wake up 5am in the morning, and then work for couple of hours before breakfast. By then, I usually get very hungry and tend to have cravings for a big breakfast (e.g., eggs, sausage and bacon...) But I know I'd end up with heavy stomach and regret having it afterward.<br /><br />I had Leksands crispbread the other morning (when I was very hungry as usual) as breakfast and I was full after 3 pieces of crispbread (=120 calorie compared to infinite if I had eaten the traditional English style breakfast). Much less calorie intake, with higher amount of fiber, and My body felt light as I ate before but just felt satisfied as I was not hungry.<br /><br />While it MAY take some adjustments for people who are used to eat muffins, pastries or heavier food for breakfast, you will be surprised that you can put pretty much anything on it and, while it'd taste good, you can still get a good amount of fibers from each piece.<br /><br />You can just eat the crispbread as it is with a cup of tea, coffee, a glass of juice or even with water [you want to have liquid nearby as crispbreads are dry :-)]. If it still feels/tastes too dry for you, put a little butter on it (that's how I used to eat in Finland). Crispbread goes very well with marinated herring.<br /><br />As other reviewer mentioned, I also wish I could buy in smaller quantities from Amazon.<br />However, buying this in bulk from Amazon definitely saves money, and they keep well for long periods of time, as long as you keep in a dark, dry place.<br /><br />I recommend Leksands Crispbread for anyone who wants to lead a healthier life style.<br /><br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />Leksands Crispbread<br /><br />Ingredients: Whole rye flower, yeast, water, salt<br /><br />Nutrition Facts<br /><br />Serving size:  1 piece (12.5g/0.4oz)<br />Serving per container:  16<br />Calories:  40 (per piece)<br />Total Fat:  0%<br />Cholesterol:  0mg<br />Sodium:  60mg (2% of Daily Value)<br />Total Carbohydrate:  8g (3% of Daily Value)<br />  Dietary fiber:  2g (8% of Daily Value)<br />  Sugars:  0g<br />Protein:  1g<br /><br />Vitamin A:  0%<br />Vitamin C:  0%<br />Calcium:  0%<br />Iron:  2%<br /><br />[*Percent Daily Values are based n a 2000 calorie diet.

review/summary: never feed them to a friend
review/text: I bought a 24 can case of these and will never do it again. I should have heeded others reviews but I thought "I'm not that finicky". You don't have to be finicky to disapprove of these. (1) They've got a stringy thing hanging off of them. (2) They are small (3) If they haven't fallen apart by the time you open the can, they will by the time you get them to your mouth. Probably more wrong too but I'm trying to stomach my way through them by making stew. I have to put them in a strainer first to rinse off whatever crap that is on them, cook them in butter and lot's of salt & pepper before I put in milk. Then close my eyes & try to palate them. I would never feed them to a friend. I think Amazon would take them back but they have been so good about that on bad products I hate to ask them.

review/summary: My favorite ground coffee
review/text: A delicious dark roast that's smooth and balanced. Buying in bulk shipment from Amazon means that the price I pay for a pound of coffee drops from almost $7 to under $5 -- well worth it. People accustomed to the bitter, burnt taste of Starbucks coffee won't like Community Coffee -- it's a traditional American grind that makes what some would consider "weak" coffee, but it's what I prefer.<br /><br />EDIT: Well, the price of coffee keeps going up. From around $47 per 10 lb box to more than $63. So it's less of a great deal now, but still cheaper than buying it in the grocery store.

review/summary: It's our favorite brand
review/text: We were very disappointed when the 1LB bags disappeared from store shelves. The 12oz was still available, but I don't think the 12oz package is worth the money. I wrote a letter to Community asking why the 1LB gone and apparently too many people found this package too difficult to deal with. I learned I could buy the 1LB packages on-line direct from CC, for essentially the same price as the grocery store, but then I saw it's even less at Amazon... And you can save even more by setting up a subscription. Well count me in and I'm a happy Community Coffee drinker.<br /><br />PS. I find if I use about 3/4 the recommended amount of ground coffee and the coffee comes out fine. I always think we are told to use more than is really needed, so I experimented with less coffee for the same taste. 3/4s seems to work fine for us and our coffee maker (of course your mileage may vary).<br /><br />Oh, one other note... I've order 10LBs (10 one-pound bags) twice now, and each time one bag's vacuum seal was broken. No big deal as I just use this bag first, but it is an odd coincidence.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/26/2012 - I've now purchased this package 4 times. Each time there is at least one package without the vacuum, however on this last order 3 bags did not have the vacuum seal. It's still a good deal, especially with the subscription discount.

I moved from Louisiana 13 years ago, but I still refuse to drink anything else.  They keep their distribution area small to help ensure the best quality, so I used to have to stock up on it when I visited LA a couple of times each year.  But it's actually just as cheap (or cheaper) to order it from Amazon.  I'm serious, this stuff is addictive!

review/summary: Community Coffee is the best and so is Amazon's price !
review/text: I am a life long resident of Louisiana and have been drinking Community Coffee since my teens.  Community Dark Roast is the best in my opinion.  Most of us who drink Community take it with us when we travel and always have it at home.  Amazon's Subscribe and Save price of $56.88 for 10 16oz. bags, with free shipping, is the best price anywhere. It's been that same price for quite a while.  I don't have to go to look for it on sale, go to the store, etc.  It's delivered to my door every 3 months.  It's the best coffee with the Amazon's best price and great service.  Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Community Coffee
review/text: Community's coffee is wonderful, the only problem with this shipment is 1 of 10 packages received on had lost its vacuum pack seal making the package soft to the touch and the coffee not as fresh as the other 9 packages.  The vacuum pack removes the air so the package is rock hard solid and the coffee keeps its freshness.  I grew up on Community coffee; these days I ship it to family members all over the US.

review/summary: Our favorite coffe at a GREAT price!
review/text: Thanks Amazon for saving me precious time and money. My husband is "set in his ways" so to speak when it comes to his coffee. Unfortunately, it's not the cheapest stuff. Not only do I not have to go out shopping for it now... it comes right to my front door.... but I also don't have to try to try to find the place that has it on sale for the week. This coffee wasn't my favorite when we first married b/c I thought the chicory was a bit to bitter but now I am hooked and not a fan of other coffee brands. Even the smell of this stuff makes me feel, "home." Thank you Community Coffee and Amazon!<br />Sincerely, Jenny Funderburk

review/summary: Community Coffee, 16-Ounce Bags, Dark Roast
review/text: Community Coffee is the coffee of Louisiana. We have a heritage of enjoying rich, full bodied coffee. No other coffee meets these requirements as well as Community. The 16-Ounce vacuum bag is becoming hard to find and more expensive. Community, like most other brands, has switched to smaller 12-ounce and larger 32-ounce loose packed (not vacuum) bags in the past year. The new bags do not maintain the fresheness we have come to expect from the vacuum pouch. Further, it is typically priced at a higher price per ounce. Preordering through Amazon to receive the 10 pound bale on a regularly scheduled (1-6 months, your choice) basis has proven to be a system that works well for me at a lower price and delivered to my door.

Never bitter, but is tasty both strong and weak, and the price is great. I no longer have to pay premium for beans and grind my own to have good coffee. Just make sure you get the dark roast as the medium roast is sweet.

review/summary: Tastes Fine and the Price is Right
review/text: We like this coffee well pretty well, having discovered it by accident at a restaurant.  It's cheaper than some of the premium brands and tastes better to us - plus it's delivered to the doorstep for free via Amazon Prime.  Also, we were looking for a ground coffee product, and we got tired of double checking the label on one of the premium brands at the grocery.  As for taste - words are so inadequate sometimes - but I would describe the Community Dark Roast as flavorful and mild, but not boring.  Your mileage may vary.

review/text: Let me first say that I absolutely LOVE my coffee.<br /><br />The taste is decent, but I wouldn't call it much of a dark roast.  I was expecting a much more bold taste.  It tastes good though, and is certainly worth the money.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this coffee is that it doesn't bother my stomach.  I end up having to give away about 1/2 of my coffees because they bother my stomach so badly.<br /><br />I really can't say much more though.  All in all, this is slightly above average tasting REGULAR coffee at a great price.<br /><br />I'm going to end up giving some of these away for Christmas and drinking the rest myself.<br /><br />Would I buy again?  Probably not.  To put it simply - I prefer a bolder coffee.

review/summary: Coffee snobs
review/text: My husband and I both worked for cafe's and I can definitely say that we're coffee snobs. We bought this during a great (Kindle) deal for I think $25. We thought, if it's bad then at least we didn't pay a ton of money. We have been trying to pinch pennies. Well, it's okay (good for those who don't care much about where there coffee comes from) if you have a good coffee maker (one that gets the water really hot), but if you have a crap coffee maker than your going to get crap coffee. Someone had loaned us a cheap Coffeemate coffeemaker and the coffee was awful, but once we got a new coffeemaker we noticed a difference. I gave this two stars because its better than Folgers.

review/text: This is a great base for muffins as other reviewers have pointed out, they did need a little help to get some more flavor kick. I added 4 squirts of Starbucks sugar free cinnamon dolce and 1 squirt of sugar free vanilla during preparation. You can add chopped walnuts or pecans and a ripe bananna just make sure you save some of the nuts to sprinkle on top.<br /><br />***Update- We didn't have any muffin cups the other day so we put it in a loaf pan after lining the pan with the nonstick aluminum foil and it turned out to be the moistest banana nut bread we have ever eaten and sugar free so it is great for Diabetics.

I ordered from Twinings.com to tide me over. Then there was a box in stock after all. Then the others would ship much sooner than three weeks. This was good, but now I have mucho.<br />I am growing to like the Twinings tea. I like black tea, and organic tea, but I need to enjoy the taste. I am lazy and want tea bags.<br />I like the taste to be full and smooth, in other words, not too bitter. And no thin finish. Taste keeps me away from Newman's Own, and from those silky pyramidal tea bags.<br />I liked Celestial Seasonings organic black tea, but it was discontinued. I liked Topco Full Circle organic English Breakfast, but my local store stopped carrying it. I like 365 organic black tea, but I am a hundred miles from Whole Foods.<br />Twinings is a good replacement for those. Bigelow is too. I use double tea bags for iced tea.

review/summary: OMG this makes delicious chicken
review/text: I made this marinade with chicken, and marinated it overnight to really infuse the meat with the flavor.  Cooked it on the grill, and basted the chicken as it cooked.  The smell before the barbecue was "making the natives restless".  Once placed on the platter I realized that I had not made enough chicken for the "gusto with which the picnickers" were eating!

review/summary: The Worst Banana-flavored Steak
review/text: Thought the marinade smelled a little funky and I told myself "there's no way the marinade can taste as strangely as it smells"...sure enough it tasted like bananas and melted plastic.  I consider myself a marinade connoisseur, and this is easily the worst marinade ever sold.  I can't believe this product is marketed on such a huge scale as poorly as it tastes (NOT like Southern whiskey if you've picked up on that).  May God have mercy on the folks at Weber.  Use Allegro.

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: Love the Hungry Jack s.f. syrup.  Has a great taste and if you compare calorie info to any of the reduced or even "regular" syrups it is a no-brainer.  I started using this when pregnant with my first son.  I ended up with gestational diabetes and I tried several different sugar free syrups.  This is by far the best of the sugar free available by a long shot.  After the pregnancy I could have switched back to regular syrup but honestly I like this better.  It isn't as sweet but it is sweet enough and I love the fact that it is only 20 calories for 1/4 cup.

I usually put two in my coffee and I had to start using 4 to get it to the same sweetness. At first I thought I must be imagining it but then I bought some more at the store and tried them side by side. There was a definite difference, but I can't guess why that would be. I'll stick to buying at the grocery store.

review/text: This is the best sweetener besides the real thing...SUGAR!  This also tastes much better then Splenda in hot drinks. For some reason, Splenda and even Stevia products, just taste bad to me in coffee or hot tea. However, Equal, or aspartame, tastes exactly like sugar!  I am so sick and tired of all the hogwash all over the internet about how this stuff is bad for you.  If you are ever in doubt, go to Snopes.com and look up Aspartame and learn the truth; This is perfectly safe, even in large quantities. Plus it won't give your kids cavities like sugar can! So go for it!

review/summary: Ah Sugar........ Ah Honey Honey......
review/text: I just want to state one thing before I begin. It has been said in certain circles that as a quid pro quo for endorsing a product, the manufacturer provides your beloved Seer with generous monetary kickbacks. Nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, I know that I gave into weakness many reviews ago and was supposed to get a kickback from that deodorant manufacturer. But the check bounced and some new Federal law went into effect preventing me from blatant profiteering. Well. at least my underarms don't offend anyone.<br /><br />As most of you know, by reading my online bio, I need to jump start my day with a few cups of coffee. The jumping cables are hooked up straight from the coffee cup to my ears (the left ear is the negative side) and I get that special "buzz" that allows me to write my ever-evolving reviews and lectures.<br /><br />But as I travel throughout the world, many heads of state ask me "would you like sugar with that good, kind, generous, selfless Metamorpho". I tell them no. Why? Because I have found a sugar subsitute that works better for me. Yes. It's equal!<br />I trained most countries to have it ready when I arrive (although Cuba and Venzuela have refused thus far). Anyway, equal comes in these nifty little packets that are easy to rip open and pour. Each one is "equal" to about a teaspoon of regular sugar (or so my tastebuds have surmised). I have been using it for years and have had no after effects. In fact, it has been instrumental in the growth of my third eye. All apprentice seers should know this.<br /><br />There is no bitter aftertaste either. I really hate it when I'm in a restaurant and have to settle for sweet n low. I tell ya people, it ruins the whole dining experience. One word of caution for all you aspiring Betty Crockers out there. Do not, I repeat, do not try to bake with equal. It does not do well being heated. Unless you want that gingerbread man to taste like flatbread, I would avoid using it.<br /><br />Equal works very well with all flavoured coffees and tea. It's also an ingredient thats found in all your favorite sodas. So, try it soon. Let me know. Your customer satisfaction survey will be arriving shortly.<br /><br />Another stirring review by -- Metamorpho ;)

review/text: This is produced and packed in India, where the oil is liquid at 'room' temperature because the room tends to be really hot.  When it is shipped to our more temperature clime, it solidifies and makes a joke of its container.<br /><br />I set it in a dishpan of hot water until it reliquifies and then pour it into a mayonnaise jar or small plastic container from whence I scoop it as needed.  My flatmate pours it into a Ziploc bag and lays it flat on a tray in the fridge to solidify, then breaks off what's needed.<br /><br />Trader Joe's has organic coconut oil already in 16 oz wide mouth jars for $5.99.<br /><br />I give Parachute 4 stars instead of 5 because they really could pack it in wide mouth containers for export.

However, it has a strange flavor.  I was expecting a strong coconut flavor, which is fine, but in reality it's a strong chemical/coconut flavor that overpowers other flavors unless the dish is highly spiced.  I've tried this oil in at least 10 different recipes with the same results.  There's a weird taste that can't be overlooked.  I'm disappointed but I won't be purchasing this again.

review/summary: Don't believe the negative comments.
review/text: I grew up in the Fiji. My grandma used to make coconut oil from scratch and sell it for extra income. I find it odd that people use coconut oil for cooking. To be honest, the only people in Fiji who used coconut oil for cooking were the ones who could not afford cooking oil. Food cooked in coconut oil tastes awful. If you are one of those people who have used coconut oil for cooking and did not notice any after taste then you did not use pure coconut oil.<br /><br />Coconut oil is good for external use like hair and skin. You can also warm it up and dissolve some camphor (cinnamomum camphora) into the coconut oil for psoriasis.<br /><br />All points aside, I am really happy with the product I received. I got an extra 200 ml for free along with the big 33.8 oz. I opened up the smaller 200 ml bottle and the oil came out of it easily. I applied a small amount on my hands and I know for sure it is pure coconut oil. I recommend this product and the price is right too.

I also make a body scrub using it and sugar and essence of orange. I wash my face in it and people always ask if it causes breakouts. No, it doesn't. The sugar exfoliates my skin and the coconut oil leaves it silky smooth. I shave my legs with it. I'm going to make body scrub gifts for Christmas. This stuff is awesome.

review/text: Excellent quality, little or no imparted flavor, and in general exactly what's wanted.  Price is right.  Frustrating to use.  I will continue to purchase, and continue to complain.<br /><br />The product is produced in India, where ambient temperatures maintain the oil in constant liquid state.  In more northerly climes, such as my own in (U.S.) WA state, the oil is always congealed to semisolid condition, making the silly little container cap useless.  "Thawing" of a quart container is clumsy, yet managing a handful of smaller containers is an unnecessary circus of busywork.  For export to cooler destinations, the product should be packaged in a wide-mouth container permissive of product extraction via spoon or spatula.

review/summary: from "straw" hair to healthy hair
review/text: "Healthy" also deserves quotes, I suppose.  Same as fingernails or animal horns, as all hair is dead on a cellular level -- unromantic but true.<br /><br />I have "thirsty" (those quotes, again!) hair, and conditioner doesn't always seem to help much.  I also have skin sensitivities, so after one manufacturer changed a formula on one of my faves for the worse, I decided to try coconut oil.<br /><br />The results are dramatic.  My hair looks really nice, as shiny as it was in my 20s, it's soft again, and I'm feeling kind of like a dupe that I've been buying chemically formulated conditioner all these years.  I agree with other reviewers that this oil, or at least the batch I got, seems to have something in it to keep it from solidifying (at least in a 70something degree bathroom) the way most culinary coconut oils will. It also doesn't have the same rich coconut flavor of my favorite brands, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1MI">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 29-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</a> - but then it's filtered, and not extra-virgin.  Probably for the best, because as nice as coconut is, I really don't want to go around smelling like cheap suntan lotion!<br /><br />Disclaimer:  using too much will obviously wreck greasy havoc on some hair, especially finer, lighter, european hair -- which I have, actually.  I couldn't have used this at all back in the day when my hair was naturally on the oily side, but if you have coarse, frizzy, wiry, or even just really dry hair, you can probably find the right amount for you to bring back the nice texture and shine without getting overly heavy -- even if that means mixing it in with a bit of gentle shampoo.

review/summary: Absolutely Great!
review/text: This is by far my favorite hot sauce to use on just about everything! The key to using this sauce is MODERATION! If you use too much you will be begging for mercy. But when you get it right, it puts just the right amount of heat to get your scalp tingling but not so bad that it takes away from the taste of what your cooking. This is excellent when mixed with chili or your favorite BBQ sauce. Look, anyone can make something hot but if it's so hot you can't taste the food then whats the purpose? This sauce allows you to add heat to your dish and still allows you to taste your dish as long as you learn to add a drop at a time until you find your tolerence level. REMEMBER your tolerence level is not the same as everyone else's! One of the great things about this sauce is you have to use so little that a single bottle will last a long time!<br /><br />Well worth the price and highly recommended. However, one word of CAUTION as with any hot sauce, when you handle or cook with this sauce be sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. When adding this sauce while cooking, the vapors will contain this sauce and get on your hands. Even hours after cooking, if you don't wash your hands and you happen to rub your eyes, you will regret it!<br /><br />The best thing to me about this sauce is it can be added during cooking or afterwards. Either way though, you have to remember to use it in moderation and treat it like a loaded weapon! It really is a great sauce in my opinion!
