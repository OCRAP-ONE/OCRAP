review/text: This was my third order for chocolate neccos and as usual, they arrived in a timely manner and were packaged so as to minimize breakage.  I love the product and cannot find it in our local stores anymore  so am very happy to have found a reliable source.  My only complaint is for the makers of the candy and that is that I don't like the white chocolate wafers and throw them away but I love the other three flavors.

review/summary: Our favorite tea
review/text: I first tried this tea at Einstein Bros. Bagels, and it is the only tea the we drink now. It has the greatest flavor, and is the finest tea that I have ever tasted. I have offered it to many friends that do not like tea and they have tried it and loved it. We all like it without cream or sugar, the flavors are so rich and vibrant that it easily stands on its own.<br />Harney & Sons even somehow got my boyfriend off of soda, he bought a bunch of different flavors and has them with his meals instead now. They compliment meals very well, and are a wonderful way to start your day and unwind in the evenings.

review/text: This cheese sauce mix is the best I have found yet.  My dad used to buy it when I was a kid and now I'm bying.  Great for potatoes, veggies etc....BUT, what I use it for most is for "Cheese Popcorn"  It's the best!!  I just use microwave popcorn, melt some butter in a coffee cup, mix butter on popcorn and pour cheese sauce powder all over the popcorn and mix well.  I use a bunch because I'm a cheese freak!  I like it messy and stickin to my fingers haha.  Hopefully some of you will try it sometime.  You'll be glad you did.

review/summary: Outrageous Price on Amazon!
review/text: My dog is extremely picky.  I tried to feed him the top quality food but he refused to eat them, so I gave this a try and he loves it.  The healthiest dog food in the world doesn't do a bit of good if he won't eat it. I'm still not sure how healthy this one is for him, but it seems to be okay.<br /><br />I rated the dog food itself 4 stars ... seems to be a decent food at a fairly reasonable price that most dogs will enjoy.  I'd feel better about it though if it were a bit more healthy - replace the "meat by-products" with a specific type of meat such as chicken (so I know I'm not feeding my dog euthanized dogs/cats!).<br /><br />Do not order this product from Amazon though, their price is OUTRAGEOUS!  Most stores sell it for around $1.30/can.

review/summary: Rich, balanced flavor perfect for dark roast lovers.
review/text: I love dark, rich, smoky coffee, and this coffee comes close enough to warrant 5 stars. I wanted the convenience of Amazon's subscription service, but I was looking for a good value, too. I took a chance and I'm delighted -- it's so delicious, I actually drink more coffee! (Like I needed to.)<br /><br />The beans are dark and glossy and look so good, you might not be able to resist popping one in your mouth. (I confess: I do.) The flavor is rich, complex, and robust. There's no bitterness that sometimes accompanies beans roasted this dark.<br /><br />I do wish there was more smoky flavor -- it's there, but more subtle than, say, Starbucks version. The upside is that there's more depth to the other flavors. A dark roast connoisseur will appreciate the blend of bold earthy tastes.<br /><br />I'd consider this the next step if you like an intense premium dark roast from the grocery store. This will definitely widen your palate and raise your expectations.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent value for superbly roasted beans.

review/text: The coffee was horrible. It had a bitter acidic flavor to it and the beans had a strong unmistakeable rancid odor to them. No date on the package as to when it was filled, but I would guess that the beans sat around for quite a while before being sold. They claim on their website that the beans are freshly packed, but nothing stating how long the product sits in a warehouse afterwards.

review/text: I purchased the french roast variety of Jeremiah's because I have been very pleased with the Fog Buster blend.  I thought perhaps that the french roast would be equally rich and layered.  Boy was I wrong.  This coffee has a flat, uniform taste with a very bad aftertaste.  Since I live overseas and the coffee options are limited, I've been buying a kilo of coffee from a local coffee vendor for about $7. I can say honestly that I prefer this other local brand to the Jeremiah's french roast.  Don't waste your money on this blend. It is truly terrible.

review/summary: Not the same as the 60's
review/text: I hate to be the only dissenter here but these are not the kind we used to buy in the sixties.<br /><br />They look the same but the texture is different. Now I admit I know nothing about the candy business or how bubble gum is made but I do know companies use filler and often cheaper ingredients to make more money.<br /><br />The old type you could bite off a hunk and wind up with a wad of bubble gum roughly the size you bit off. And the more you chewed the softer it got.<br /><br />These Bubble Cigars once you have chewed them for about a minute turns into a small lump a quarter of the size you put in your mouth and the lump is so tough you have to spit it out- it is just too tough to chew. Like a piece of hard rubber.<br /><br />I admit they look the same and the flavor is close to the sixties but they are not anywhere near the quality of what we used to buy. The old kind you could chew for hours, blow bubbles with , and the flavor would last as long as you chewed.<br />These will do none of that.<br /><br />They just seem to be made from very cheap ingredients with about 70% filler.<br /><br />It's a shame because they used to be really good. But these are not what we grew up with.<br />It is very cheap bubble gum made in the color and the shape of the old Bubble Gum Cigars many of us used to love.<br /><br />Fortunately, they do not cost very much so you can try them yourself without being out too much money.

Was REALLY excited when I saw this product, so I ordered 3 jars just to have a nice supply.  Turns out, the filling is more goo-like than anything.  Might be a great topping for ice cream, but as a pie filling it was just like toothpaste from a tube....all gel with no chunks or either strawberry or rhubarb, so very dismal and depressing.  Won't be ordering this again.  Will just buy local pies when the urge strikes next, I suppose!

review/text: I've been drinking green smoothies for a while now, and decided I would try to improve them by adding even more nutrients with Amazing Grass. I opted for the berry flavor because most of my smoothies were made with berries anyway, so I thought it would go well. I also decided to go with Berry because it costed a few dollars less than the original. Next time, I will pay the extra few dollars. The taste reminded me of cherry cough syrup or something medicinal. It unfortunately ruined the taste of my green smoothie. Now I have this entire container to go through, I will probably just mix with water and gag it down. It's too bad, I was excited to use this product.

review/text: Tried this as an energy booster. Getting older and would just run out of gas after an hour or so of physical effort. Was absolutely amazed at the difference in my energy level after taking this the first couple of weeks. My workouts were better so there was a cumulative effect. Then the dramatic difference started to fade. I began to notice more subtle differences. As I've gotten older, I've noticed that my body doesn't do some things as well. I get dehydrated easily which can cause other problems. I sweat when I am working hard, but not easily and it takes longer to turn it off after cool down. The Green Superfood has turned back the clock. My recover period after hard physical activity is much shorter. In general, everything is just working a little better. That is Amazing.

review/summary: Pretty good supplement on paper, hoping the body will like it in the long term.
review/text: I bought Amazing Grass to mix in as part of an energy drink for a healthy snack or recovery after a long run, and also just as a supplement. The reviews are wonderful and the price wasn't too bad, so I bought the Chocolate variety for mixing with unsweetened Almond milk and Plant Fusion protein powder. Sometimes when I'm hungry and need the drink to be filling, I also add a dollop of peanut butter.<br /><br />So, the taste. I've never tasted wheatgrass or any other "superfood supplement" and I can only imagine that they taste like vomit, as people count Amazing Grass as one of the better tasting drinks of its kind... while I find myself doing all kinds of flavor mixing just to be able to tolerate a single scoop in ~ 16oz of liquid.  It smells and looks just like the henna you use to dye your hair! It tastes like hay, like barnyard dried grassy hay. Not super unpleasant, but not something I'd imagine someone would choose to eat if it didn't come with other, larger benefits.  I cannot detect any cocoa flavor in it. It says cocoa on the ingredient list, but it's pure grass in flavor.<br /><br />The physical results:  I'm not sure. I've been drinking one serving a day for a month now, and it's very hard to say if it's done much on its own. I've definitely benefited from eliminating dairy from my diet (which I did concurrently with starting Amazing Grass) and I'm confident the probiotics are healthy for me, but I don't feel any extra energy or anything like that. Nor did I expect to, since none of the ingredients are those that would give the average person's body an actual short-term boost. When I recently went on vacation and forgot to bring any with, there wasn't any difference in my daily energy or feelings of health, though I started right back up upon returning home.<br /><br />Now after 30 days of use, when it came time to reorder, I thought about it carefully and I realized I'm pretty happy with the way I'm feeling these days and in case any part of that came from the addition of Amazing Grass, I'm purchasing another container.  This time I've ordered the non-flavored stuff, since it was less expensive and I've been adding a teaspoon of cocoa powder to my drinks anyway to help mask the hay-like henna flavor. I guess now I'll see if the minimal amount of cocoa they put in the chocolate variety had any flavor to it!<br /><br />:::UPDATE:::<br /><br />Since the above review I've been using the unflavored Amazing Grass and haven't noticed any taste difference between it and the chocolate once it's mixed into my vanilla almond milk. I've completely gotten used to the taste and the grassy hay flavor has become very normal to me, so I no longer need to mask it with a lot of cocoa powder unless I'm in the mood for chocolate.  Overall I feel kind of like I do when taking a multivitamin: I can't feel any immediate difference, but I believe it's rounding out my diet in good but subtle ways, so I'll continue to take it.

review/text: definitely does NOT taste like berries. it tastes like seaweed, which i used to snack on so i'm okay with it. but the only hint of berries is when i sneak some in my baby's eggs and it smells like berries when being cooked. also if you're planning on giving this to a kid/baby, my daughter (2 year old) acts likes it's tobasco if she drinks some of mine (i mix it for water), but she's okay with it mixed in eggs. i have this stuff 3 times a day, and it isn't much for an energy boost (coming from a former caffeine addict and regular napper). i have noticed that i seem more "with it" and sharp which is why i'm taking it in the first place. i've subscribed to receive this product regularly.

review/summary: A great superfood powder!!
review/text: I've tried so many other green powders and just could not get past the funky taste, even when trying to hide it in smoothies.  This one is a really a great product and a good price.  I paid $27.99 at Whole Foods.  The price thru Amazon is actually better than in the store or on the product's website so I will definitely be ordering it here!  I mix this with some soy milk or rice milk, a tablespoon or two of dark cocoa powder (like Valrhona), a scoop of protein powder, a banana, some cinnamon and some ice (sometimes a bit of peanut butter too) and blend it up until nice and smooth.  Everyone that tries this smoothie gets hooked on how great it tastes and how healthy it is!

review/summary: The Best of the SuperFood Powders
review/text: I have tried almost every superfood power out there.  This is the best.  I have it with water and with Rice Dream.  Both are good.  No it's not like a very sweet shake.  But, you can add it to a smoothie or enjoy alone.  Best of all I will drink it.  Unlike a lot of superfood powders I feel a difference when I have it.  I have more energy throughout the day.

review/summary: A life staple!
review/text: I have been drinking a scoop of this stuff daily for a few months now. The first time I drank it, I mixed it with a small amount of pomegranate juice (~4oz) and could barely get it down. Now, I mix it with 6-8oz of juice and barely notice the taste. I usually have it with organge juice in the morning, but have also mixed it with V8 Fusion, POM, and my own personal juice concoctions. One day I ran out of juice and was forced to mix it with water... not my favorite, but tolerable. Make sure to mix it very well, as it tends to settle and can be gritty.<br /><br />I feel so much healthier when I drink this. As someone who suffers from chronic fatigue, this seems to help a little bit. In my opinion, this is a very well-rounded nutritional supplement. It is fresh, energizing, and an excellent deal with subscribe and save!

review/summary: I won't live without this!
review/text: I think the berry flavor is far better than the veggie powder as far as taste goes but I don't mind either one.  I add this to some juice, kefir, some coconut oil whatever, but I always add stevia with it.  I think this is a very cheap insurance to staying or getting healthy.  I battled with my health my whole life.  I try now to stay as natural as I can with my health care now.  It leads me to `well' a lot quicker. I was one of those DES babies you may or may not have heard about.  Our mothers took DES which was a drug to prevent a miscarriage but what happened was it caused problems with the baby and left a compromised immune system.  This is why my whole life it has been one thing after another.  Well, THIS powder is fantastic.  When I take this consistently I have far more energy and I just seem to stay well.  When I get lazy about it and stop taking it I have no energy, I get foggy brained, down in the dumps.  Big difference. I figure if I take this in the morning, the rest of the day is covered as far as my fruits and veggies are concerned.  What I do eat on top of this is a bonus!  If you `really' really can't stand the taste then add the stevia, add fruit, juice whatever, it so worth taking this powder!!  Personally I have no problem with the flavor. Five starts from me!

review/summary: Brain Food!
review/text: Absolutely love this stuff...despite the taste! I have been using this for years and it's a noticeable difference when using this superfood. I tried others which were certainly more palatable but lacking in the raw horsepower this particular brand has. I have both green and berry, but prefer the "berry" (loosely labeled) in the morning.  I can survive and thrive with only a mid morning coffee, as opposed to the continual loop to the coffee machine. Don't get me wrong, they would have to pry my coffee cup away from me, but this supplements nicely without any letdown. Most important, is the lifting of the brain fog at rapid speed. As one writer stated, it's something to drink down and get past. I find it to be the taste I love to hate.

review/summary: much better than the "green' drink
review/text: This really seems to give me a boost in the morning.  First thing I do after waking up (well second thing...) is go downstairs and mix a scoop of this in a big glass of water.  really seems to help wake me up...not a rush, just a generally energetic feeling...gets rid of that early morning lethargic frame of mind.  The berry tastes soooo much better than the green which tastes horrible.  I take this in combination with a multi, and a few other things and I feel better.  Added benefit is that it has a good bit of fiber but doesn't cause bloating.

review/text: I only just tried this product today, so I'm reviewing the taste only!<br /><br />If you, like me, find the taste of regular green powders repulsive, then you might like this product.  It really does taste like cocoa (not like milk chocolate!), with only the faintest hint of green dirt taste.  VERY faint.  It actually tasted good enough in warm water that I believe this will make a good comfort treat when it's cold.

review/summary: Great powder, not strong berry flavor
review/text: The powder is great. I use this in conjunction with a multivitamin to get all my nutrients for the day. However, I've tried the regular Green SuperFood powder, the berry flavor is not very strong. I could almost interchange the two flavors and the taste wouldn't be very discernible.  The berry flavor that you can taste is very artificial tasting.<br /><br />Minus the berry taste I recommend this or any Green SuperFood to a lot of people. I prefer to use these in smoothies. However when I don't have time to put together a smoothie the powder is great with just almond milk (extra protein). I know they say you can just add it to water and you can, but the taste is much to be desired.  I wouldn't recommend blending it with soy milk. I attempt this hoping to cut some fat from almond milk, but the powder with soy milk seemed to emulsify creating a very un-tasty like mousse. I'm not a culinary genius so I'm not sure why this happened. But it was gross.

review/text: I don't understand the people that say this doesn't taste good. I have tried many different green drink mixes and this by far and away is the best tasting thing out there. I can understand that the texture and consistency may take some getting used to, but of all the green drink mixes out there, this one is the best! I like it much better than anything on the market in this category. One of the biggest benefits I have seen is that while everyone around me is getting sick with colds and the flu, I have no symptoms. It is good to be and feel healthy. I'm glad I'm choosing to have this regularly and look and feel like I have energy to get through the day. Thanks to the folks at Amazing Grass for making such a great product!

review/summary: Only "greens" I can stand.
review/text: I don't eat greens. I needed them in my diet, so I tried several "greens" products, the taste of grass just makes me gag, the aftertaste makes me dry heave. This Amazing Grass Berry Flavor fixed that. It doesn't taste great, don't expect this to taste like Ocean Spray, but the berry flavor does definitely overpower the "green" flavor. The aftertaste is a refreshing not too sweet berry flavor. I like to put a scoop of this in with a scoop of pea protein in the mornings. Good stuff.

review/text: I started using this supplement a few days ago, I'm already seeing a difference in my skin. My face is less red and my eczema is beginning to heal and clear up! I don't crave sweets or drink nearly as much soda anymore! I love this stuff just mixed with a little mango juice. It is a bit gritty in thin liquid, but that doesn't bother me. Since it doesn't have much taste, all I taste is juice with a slight berry flavor. I have been iron deficient for years and this stuff has helped tremendously! I don't get as cold and I am not completely fatigued throughout the day. I sleep better during the night even! I love this stuff and am going to keep using it!

review/summary: very important
review/text: If you don't get your daily veggie diet this is for you.  Most people don't get all the veg they need each day.  Even if you think you do, supplementing with this a couple times a year might be a benefit.  Say you have a yearly physical coming up, try finishing one of these right up to the last day and see if you feel its made an impact.  Flaxseed should help with Lipids and the anitoxidants should (possibly) reduce your chance of cancer, cardiovas problems in the long run.  Taste is not something to be desired by itself. Its not bad, just not outstanding. I mix with my protein (trop/mango) flavor and it helps.  Just think of it as something to chug down and be done with it.  I've tasted worse.

review/summary: Fine I guess
review/text: This powder has a strong wheat grass flavor to it.  It smells great like berries, but doesn't actually taste like berries at all.  The scoop seems pretty large for one serving, also, I have to mix it with at least 16oz. of water otherwise it is just too thick and clumpy.  It probably has nutritional benefits, but I don't feel magically different.  Maybe if you had a terrible diet pre amazing grass you could feel the change.  Nice to get a quick 5-9 (I'm not sure how they could have been more accurate with this measurement) servings of daily veggies though.

review/summary: awesome product...shipping fees stink!
review/text: this product is awesome but the shipping on it is ridiculous.  there are so many other sites which carry this product where there is no shipping.  i love and prefer shopping amazon, but this product is pricey enough where free shipping should be implemented... c'mon get with the rest of the amazon vendors.  at least make it free shipping if you order 3 or more!

review/text: This is really nasty. I've tried other green drinks, and I'm convinced this by far is the worse represented. It says Berry, but NOT A CHANCE! It's more like wheat grass with dandelion. I honestly dont know the effects it will have, because I just cant stomach the taste. Not even holding my nose and swallowing. I dread it. Will NOT buy or recommend others.

review/text: I mixed this powder into water and it tasted so terrible, that I had to plug my nose in order to finish the glass! I am not a picky person at all (I'll tolerate or even like most things that other people are disgusted by) , but this powder tastes NOTHING like berry and even after stirring the powder vigorously into my glass of water, it was still very gritty. I wonder if I got a defective item or if they accidently gave me the regular green powder and not the berry flavored powder when they were packaging it or something. ??? I'm bummed that I can't return this item.

review/summary: They can't claim it doesn't purge your system...
review/text: I purchased this because I was watching the Reluctantly Healthy videos on yahoo, and one of them said drinking green powder is good for you. This was the first thing that came up on amazon when I searched 'green powder'. The price was reasonable ($15.00) but when I opened it, it has a strong smell of raspberry and acai berry. When you make it, because its more ground up veggies than powder, it periodically sinks to the bottom so you have to stir it when you want a drink. To mew it tasted like a mixture of pet store food and the acai berry, which I'm not a fan of. The drink gave me a headache, and at the end of my work day it had made me so sick i ended up having to pull over on the side of the road and throw up.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: This was the second brand of "green drink" that I've tried, and I'm very thankful that it was. If it had been my first experience with a green drink, I would have given up drinking them immediately. This stuff is awful! I have to literally hold my breath and force myself to drink it. Not only does it taste terrible, but it contains lots of small particles that irritate my throat making me want to cough. In addition, there is always a sizable amount of material left at the bottom of the glass, even though I stir it every time I take a drink. This is the berry flavored version of this product, but it doesn't have a hint of berry flavor. I'm also thankful that I only bought a small size container, and I will definitely be going back to my original brand (Trader Joe's) after I finish all of this one. If I can finish all of this one, that is.

review/text: I love Beer Nuts!  They are my favorite nuts to snack on with their salty but sweet taste.  I just can't get enough of them.  I usually have to pay about $6 in the grocery store for a 12oz can of them.  But Amazon makes it possible to buy them in 19oz plastic jars for about $3.40 each when you buy a Pack of 6.  That is a steal!  You just can't find them any cheaper anywhere.  This is an excellent buy.

review/summary: the BEST steel Cut Oats
review/text: I grew up on various hot cereal products and frankly, I loved almost all of them. My wife however, didn't like ANY of them. One day as we sat in the restaurant of a nice bay area hotel, she ordered 'steel cut oatmeal' for her breakfast... and I joined her. She loved it.<br /><br />I found Quaker's Steel Cut Oatmeal hard to find...but definitely worth it! Thank goodness for Amazon... the Sears Catalogue of this century!

Of the two I think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5U3I">McCANN'S Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, 28-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)</a> has a bit better flavor. The McCann's brand seems to taste nuttier.<br /><br />As to the Quaker Steel Cut Oats:  Not bad for something you can easily buy in most grocery stores. The cooked oatmeal is not mushy or pasty but has a bit of texture. Also, I had no problems with "rocks" as the oatmeal cooked up tender but a bit chewy.<br /><br />Recommend with caveats given.

review/summary: Works wonders for my IBS
review/text: I love this oatmeal. I cook up a big batch and warm it up daily for breakfast or even a mid-afternoon snack. I put one tablespoon of butter in a pan and add one cup of oats. Over medium heat, I stir the oats until I can begin to smell them then I add 3 cups of water and one cup of 1% milk with 1/2 tsp of kosher salt and then cook on low (covered) for 30 minutes,stirring occasionally. When I get my serving, I add brown sugar and fresh blueberries and then nuke it in the microwave for one minute. Usually I can't eat oatmeal because it aggravates my IBS but the steel cut oats have actually helped me out a lot! They taste wonderful and have a very pleasant chewy texture.

Stacy's pita chips are "baked, all natural, and totally delicious." Contains wheat. Bought one bag from the supermarket to check out before ordering from Amazon. Verified the vegan ingredients of the "Simply Naked" variety which is flavored with sea salt by calling the Stacy's Chip Hotline. [Other varieties of Stacy's pita chips may not be.] This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices.

I recommend this and the Tully's decaf.  Both hold their aroma and are flavorful, without the bitterness.<br /><br />BTW, I'm also a fan of the Breakfast Blend from Green Mountain and the Blueberry blend (a different surprise in your coffee brew)
