review/text: Great tea... I love that the color confuses people with lime koolaide.  This tea tastes fantastic.  I haven't tried it over ice yet but soon.  I typically put 4 drops of stevia in my cup and it satiates my sweet tooth.  The package suggests to empty the remainder leaves from the bag into your cup after steeping.  I've never done this before but I like it a lot.  I highly recommend this green tea.  Your insides will thank you.

review/summary: Great if you want tea bags
review/text: I bought these back in 08, and I still have a ï¿½ package left in year 11. These will last you a while. (I don't drink tea everyday though). Each bag can be re-used a few times ~2-3 times each depending on the size of your cup. I usualy make tea from a cast iron tea pot, but sometimes i'm in a rush. This tea is excelent tasting (oishi desu) for baged tea. Your tea won't be a green as the photo, but it will be like a yellow green. If your in the market for bagged green tea, you my friend just found the right page.

review/summary: NO HOT WATER REQUIIRED. ROOM TEMPERATURE OR HOT WATER -- YOUR CHOICE
review/text: I've never been a tea drinker. I don't like hot drinks. I end up throwing boxes of tea out because it expires before I drink it.  BUT NOT THIS TEA, I'M ALREADY ON MY SECOND CUP TODAY.  I'm sure I will drink up the whole 100 packs in one month or less.<br /><br />This tea can be steeped in room temperature water.  That's right.  No need to heat up any water.  Just steep it for 3 minutes in room temperature water. GREAT FOR CAMPING AND ON THE RUN.<br /><br />I've never liked green tea either because it is so bitter.<br /><br />This tea has no bitter taste to it.<br /><br />I bought mine at Costco 2 days ago and was going to force myself to drink it for all the health benefits including antioxidants and to speed up my metabolism. Green tea takes an inch off my waste after just one cup. Apparently, with age we get bloated. But I won't need to force myself to drink it because it has no bitter taste to it at all.  It is so pleasant drinking it.<br /><br />It didn't keep me awake all night like other green teas do.<br /><br />In the winter, I will use lightly warmed water instead of room temperature.<br /><br />If you want hot tea just heat up the water (NO BOILING WATER ALLOWED) and steep for 3 minutes.<br /><br />Remember, you can use any temperature water with this tea.<br /><br />The instructions say that using cold water releases less of the caffeine.  I don't like caffeine so using unheated water is perfect for me.

review/summary: good quality green tea compared to other brands of tea bags
review/text: nice, genuine taste of matcha, compared to many other kinds of green tea bags on the market that neither have the color nor the taste. The only downside is that each bag doesn't last long -- one bag is only enough to make a 12oz cup of fragrant tea, after that it's nearly tasteless.

review/summary: Good Japanese Green Tea
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by how good this Japanese green tea blend is.  I feel that many of the negative reviewers are not familiar with Japanese green tea.  Many of the American brands such as Lipton are not Japanese green tea.  It is likely a blend of Indian and Chinese leaves that make a pale to dark yellowish brew.  The taste is often slightly bitter with a cleaner aftertaste.<br /><br />Japanese matcha tea is milled under-processed tea leaves and makes a rich dark green brew. Depending on how you brew it, it can be quite hearty and has a sweet nutty flavor.<br /><br />The Kirland Signature Matcha Blend uses matcha powder along with sencha tea leaves.  Sencha leaves are matured leaves and has a similar taste to common store brand green tea.  The combination makes a slightly lighter, yet still rich dark green tea.  The color is a transparent pea green.  The taste is complex with notes of sweet grass and nuts.  And it leaves a clean aftertaste.<br /><br />I won't give it 5 stars because of a few issues.  The tea comes in individually sealed plastic packets.  If you're not careful, the matcha powder goes all over the place.  I'd recommend you open it away from your face over a sink.  Also the sencha tea leaves are not very good quality as they have a lot of stems and non-leaf parts in it.  The teabags do have a notched paper handle that wedges in the rim of your cup, but it has a tendency to fall in if you're not careful.  One plus though is that it does not use staples.<br /><br />Overall, I feel this is an authentic green tea very similar to those served in Japanese restaurants. If you like that, then you will like this product.

review/summary: Too green
review/text: I personally prefer gunpowder green tea over the green powder tea such as this.  It's not just the color, but the taste is a little too 'leafy' for me.  Gunpowder green tea has a much more mild flavor and isn't nearly as prone to taste bitter, even when steeping for more than 2 minutes.  If you prefer green tea (literally-speaking) and don't mind a somewhat bitter 'spinach-y' taste, then try this.

review/summary: Delicious and noticeable health benefits!
review/text: This is the best green tea I have consumed so far. I used to always have horrible breath and ever since I started drinking this particular brand of green tea , my bad breath has subsided immensely!! I cannot believe it myself, however I'm also not eating as much as I used to in the past. I also cut out a lot of processed foods, but in the past even if I did this, I would still have horrible breath.<br /><br />This is also helping me lose weight, which I was doing before consuming the tea, but this is helping a lot. I am an anxious, moody, and most of the time stressful person and when I'm feeling at a point where my head is about to explode, I just make sure to make a cup and the stress literally melts away. It helps me sleep, which I have trouble doing so (I also take melatonin). Melatonin by itself rarely puts me to sleep now a days, so this helps soo much.<br /><br />I'm truly grateful and happy to have found this tea and added it to my daily diet. It has helped me soo much to relax, sleep, fight bad breath and God knows what else that I haven't yet noticed! :)<br /><br />Highly recommend :).

review/summary: I swear by it
review/text: This review is from: Kirkland Signature Ito En Matcha Blend (Green Tea), 100% Japanese Green Tea Leaves, 100 Tea Bags (Misc.)<br />First off I have no connection(s) to Costco; Don't even own card or stock nor any member of my friends or family is employed.<br /><br />I have added green tea to my weight loss regiment which also includes RK-500 which blocks or dissolves fat and Liponexol which does the same for carbs<br /><br />I don't exercise and being a single male a eat mostly prepared food (but I take vitamins too Kirkland Multi pack) my only exercise is walking my dogs twice a day and I have noticed I walk more briskly now.<br /><br />This is how I prepare the tea; I use two bags in a large mug ( I use about 9.Oz size); drink that then later, on my second cup I add 1 more tea bag to the two I already used and drink that.<br /><br />One other item I have to make a plug for is I love my Nuwave tabletop oven it uses less power than a conventional over and it lets the grease and fat drip away from the food you are cooking which is way more healthy plus you don't have to thaw out the meat prior to cooking.<br /><br />All of this is helping me lose weight. Below is some info on green tea I found on the web. And BTW my comment to the reviewer who gave a one star review and complained about the taste; get tough cupcake no pain no gain.<br /><br />Diet suggestion #1<br /><br />Avoid diet drinks ans sugar substitutes. That right avoid them as much as possible. Though they help prevent you from gaining weight,they also PREVENT YOU FROM LOSING WEIGHT.<br /><br />Diet suggestion #2<br /><br />Eat protein and only proteins for breakfast. This sets up your metabolism to burn fat the rest of the day. Avoid "breakfast" drinks as they contain sugar and any carbs too.<br /><br />Diet suggestion #3<br /><br />This will be the most difficult; keep the room temperature as low as you can tolerate. Your body will burn fat to maintain it's metabolism and body temp. I prefer 64 degrees.<br /><br />What makes tea increase weight loss? According to scientific studies, it is the catechins, caffeine and theanine that makes green tea an effective weight loss tool.<br /><br />In particular, scientists have found that EGCG (the most active and abundant of catechins) and caffeine are especially important. They fight obesity in at least 7 ways.<br /><br />Method #1:<br />Boosts Metabolism<br /><br />There are 3 kinds of fat. They can be found beneath the skin, in the body organs and in the muscles.<br /><br />Brown adipose tissue is a layer of fat beneath the skin that has the ability to generate heat. Scientists found that green tea stimulates the heat burning process (called thermogenesis) much more than caffeine alone would.<br /><br />Green Tea Metabolism - How Many More Calories?<br /><br />Method #2:<br />Burns Fat<br /><br />Fat is an excellent source of energy in humans. Beta-oxidation is a process during which fat is broken down to provide energy. Scientists found that green tea burns fat by stimulating the beta-oxidation process.<br /><br />Green Tea Burn Fat<br /><br />Method #3:<br />Prevents Fat Storage<br /><br />An adipocyte cell is a fat cell or connective tissue that is involved in the synthesis and storage of fat. Scientists found that green tea prevents fat cells from multiplying and enlarging.<br /><br />In an animal study, scientists found that green tea increases weight loss by blocking the actions of enzymes involved in the synthesis and storage of fat.<br /><br />A 2006 study conducted by Donald Danforth Plant Science Center discovered that green tea may help reduce fat storage by moderating your body's production of hormone insulin. The scientists discovered that green tea does this by blocking the production of glutamate dehydrogenate (GDH).<br /><br />This is important because insulin plays a key part in converting glucose (blood sugar) into fat.<br /><br />Method #4:<br />Reduces Food Craving<br /><br />When you eat sugary food, your blood sugar level spikes up. This triggers a large release of insulin to move the glucose out of blood into cells for storage.<br /><br />Because your body can overreact by producing too much insulin, this can cause a sharp dip in glucose level afterwords. Low sugar levels increase your cravings, hunger, and mood swings, and reduces energy level. End result? You crave more sugary food, causing the vicious cycle to repeat itself.<br /><br />Green tea, by regulating your blood sugar levels, helps to reduce food cravings and hunger pangs.<br /><br />Green Tea and Blood Sugar<br /><br />Method #5:<br />Blocks Dietary Fat Absorption<br /><br />Another green tea weight loss secret...<br /><br />Digestive enzymes act on the foods we eat so that the body can absorb them. According to a 2006 peer review study by Wolfram, green tea reduces carbohydrate and fat absorption by blocking the actions of these enzymes.<br /><br />Method #6:<br />Regulates Glucose Uptake<br /><br />A study conducted by Ashida found that drinking green tea increases the glucose uptake by skeletal muscles and reduces the glucose uptake by fat tissue.<br /><br />End result? You are able to exercise longer, which will help you burn more calories and fat. By exercising more, you develop more muscles, which will help you maintain an active lifestyle.<br /><br />Green Tea Diet and Exercise<br /><br />Method #7:<br />Synergism with Caffeine<br /><br />Ready for the final green tea weight loss magic? Now consider this: When is 1+1=3?<br /><br />Studies conducted by scientists Dulloo and Rumpler found that caffeine and catechins benefit from one another's presence. Together, they burn more calories than each compound is on its own.<br /><br />Green tea, including caffeine, greatly increases and prolongs the heat burning effect. It helps you burn more calories even when you are sleeping!

review/summary: Kirkland Japanese Green Tea
review/text: I've been drinking Kirkland branded green tea for at least three years.  It used to be packaged in a yellow box with yellow envelopes inside. The instructions on the back of those envelopes said to steep the tea in boiling water for 30 seconds.<br /><br />This differs from the current green colored box and its envelopes.  Also, the brewing instructions are different.  The new tea is identified as Matcha and the (different and confusing) brewing instructions are:<br /><br />"Insert tea bag, pour 80ï¿½C (176ï¿½F) hot water.  Steep 30 seconds, shake tea bag and remove.  Empty remaining Matcha from outer envelope to surface of tea."<br /><br />I interpreted this as meaning: Cut the tea bag open and shake the soggy ground tea leaves that are in the tea bag into your cup.  My wife read this as shaking whatever Matcha was left in the (green) outer envelope (rather than the tea bag)into the cup.  For the cup of tea I just brewed, there was no remaining Matcha in the envelope.  Consequently, I cut open the nylon envelope and poured the soggy matcha into the cup. It did taste stronger, but not unpleasantly bitter.  In fact, it was very good.<br /><br />If you want to learn more about Matcha and its health benefits, you can view a neat video clip here:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Make sure you click the yellow large screen display button at the right bottom corner of the screen.

review/summary: Not very good quality green tea.
review/text: This green tea doesn't even compare to Japanese matcha.  Kirkland Ito En Matcha is extremely weak in flavor.  In fact, with one tea bag it doesn't taste, smell, or even look like the matcha you find in Japan, or the green teas you find elsewhere.  It is flavorless and odorless unless you pack two or three tea bags in a cup and, even then, it's very poor quality in comparison to other green teas.<br /><br />This Kirkland Ito En Matcha isn't even close to as good as other green tea available for about the same price on Amazon, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009K77OI">Yamamotoyama - Green Tea (Sushi Bar Style) 90 Bag Value Pack</a>.  That brand is significantly higher quality in every respect, even if the price is mostly shipping charges.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you're looking for top quality green tea, this Kirkland Ito En Matcha is not it.

review/text: I don't get all the rave. It's at the bottom of my list in term of quality tea. At first I thought I was brewing it for too long or too high a temperature. So I tried different conditions. Letting the water cool down for 1 min (from kettle at 80C) and leaving the tea bag for 30 secs in half a cup (~4 oz) did get rid of the bitterness and provided some flavor (use two tea bag in a 6 oz to get more flavor and lower bitterness).<br />Overall I am not impress and will never buy again.

review/summary: Disappointed by a normally good product
review/text: This tea arrived stale. The production date on the package was over a year ago, and there are about four months left until the product's "best by" date. Sadly, there was no way to know this until it arrived. Drinking it is bearable, but not enjoyable as it usually is with this product. If you can buy it fresh elsewhere I would recommend it, because it is normally a very subtle, pleasant tea that brews in a speedy 30 seconds. I really like it when I'm in a rush.

The documented positive effects of green tea on losing weight has caused more and more people looking to lose weight to seek out this ancient brew.<br /><br />However does green tea actually help you to lose weight? Is this all simply hype or is there something real and factual to the stories? Well here are some interesting facts about drinking green tea and weight loss.<br /><br />Advantages of Drinking Green Tea for Weight Loss<br /><br />Green tea and boosting your metabolism - Recently the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported its findings on the effect of drinking green tea and weight loss. Researchers found that green tea extract actually increased the metabolism of green tea drinkers dramatically. So much so that in a 24 hour period the average metabolic rate of the green tea drinkers in the studies increased by over 4%. Green tea possesses extremely high levels of catechin polyphenols. These substances actually aid your body in increasing its ability to oxidize fat and speeds up thermo-genesis which is how quickly your body burns off excess fat and calories. This is a critical factor of drinking green tea and weight loss.<br /><br />Researchers also found that green tea regulates glucose leevels. Green tea helps to keep your blood levels stable after each meal and prevents spikes in insulin. This means less fat is stored after each meal while drinking green tea. This is directly tied to the active ingredients called catechins found in high levels in green tea.<br /><br />Green tea also reduces your cravings and appetite - In a recent study it was found that green tea extracts caused rats to lose up to 21 percent of their body weight after a week of being injected with green tea extract. These rats were injected daily with the green tea extract. As a result the rats consumed up to 60 percent less food after a week. It's believed that this is tied directly to green tea's ability to regulate blood sugar levels.<br /><br />Green Tea and Weight Loss - The Bottom Line<br /><br />Green tea helps you lose weight by increasing your metabolic rate boosting your body's ability to burn excess calories and stored fat. Green tea also regulates your blood sugar levels and suppresses your appetite. Green tea is also a far superior choice to drinking coffee each day. So overall the stories are indeed true in regards to the power of drinking green tea and weight loss.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OHVCIQ">Kancura Herb Slimming Tea + Genseng Tea</a><br /><br />How to Brew Green Tea ?<br />==================<br />Although it's not hard to do, there are a few things to be considered when brewing green tea<br /><br />Water quality...<br />Good quality water is essential for making a good cup of green tea. Make sure you're using good water.<br /><br />Water temperature...<br />This is where most mistakes are made. Brew your green tea too hot, and your tea will become bitter. The correct temperature does vary depending on the green tea, but for most it is around 165-170 degrees F (73-76 C.)<br /><br />Proportion of green tea to water...<br />Most of our green teas are brewed at 1 heaping teaspoon (5 grams) per 8 ounces of water, but this can vary depending on the tea.<br /><br />Brew time...<br />Generally, two minutes is all it takes Any longer, and the taste may becomes too bitter. Also, it's very important to NOT stir, shake, or mix the tea.<br /><br />Allowing the tea room to expand...<br />This is rather important. Chinese green tea is compact - it needs room to expand. Tea balls do not work well at all. You'll be much better off using a Japanese teapot that was designed with green tea in mind. It is a one time investment of between $30-$100, and will make your life so much easier.<br /><br />Take a good look at the inside of this green tea teapot to the left, made in Japan. The infuser screen goes all the way around the inside of the teapot, allowing the tea leaves to expand fully. This is the best kind to use. These teapots are rather small, about the size of a grapefruit, and usually hold 8-13 ounces or so.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002K2MUUY">Lipton Green Tea - 100% Natural, 2009 New Spring Green Tea, 50 Fresh Tea Bags from China by A2AWorld Green Tea</a>

All rights reserved.<br />Previous studies have suggested that this antioxidant may protect against breast cancer and other cancers, but this research has been limited, and the mechanism behind these effects isn't clear.<br />Researchers say the results suggest that green tea's anticancer effects may be largely because of its high content of EGCG, which helps the body's cells from becoming damaged and aging prematurely.<br />Behind Green Tea's Anticancer Effect<br />In the study, presented this week at the Experimental Biology 2008 conference, researchers examined the effects of the green tea antioxidant on several indicators of breast cancer growth in laboratory mice.<br />One group of the female mice was fed a solution of the antioxidant in water for five weeks while the other received regular drinking water. During the second week of the study, researchers injected both groups with breast cancer cells.<br />At the end of the study, researchers measured tumor size, weight, and density as well as VEGF protein levels associated with tumor growth.<br />The results showed that treatment with the green tea antioxidant decreased tumor size by 66% and weight by 68% compared with the control group. Mice fed the antioxidant also had significantly lower density of small blood vessels within tumors and VEGF protein levels.<br />Researcher Jian-Wei Gu, of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, says the green tea antioxidant may work against breast cancer by suppressing blood vessel growth in breast tumors as well as slowing the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells.<br /><br />Mechanism for green tea's anti-cancer action revealed<br />17-May-2005<br />Related topics: Research, Phytochemicals, plant extracts, Cancer risk reduction<br />Green tea appears to protect against cancer by affecting a 'promiscuous' protein that pharmaceutical experts are already targeting in their work on anti-cancer drugs, according to new research.<br />The study, by PhD student Christine Palermo at the University of Rochester Medical Center, reveals a potential new mechanism to explain the tea, and particularly its active compounds' action against cancer.<br />While many studies suggest that green tea protects people against some forms of cancer, such as breast and liver cancer, exactly how it does so has been difficult to pinpoint.<br />"It's important to find out the source of green tea's protective effects," said toxicologist Thomas A Gasiewicz, whose work on the harmful effects of dioxin led the Rochester group to explore the protective effects of green tea.<br />"What is exciting here is that a completely new mechanism has been found that very well could be responsible for its protective effects, and that could help us find a compound that is much more potent."<br />Palermo, Gasiewicz, and current undergraduate Claire Westlake discovered that a chaperone protein known as HSP90 is involved in conferring green tea's protective effects. Other researchers have shown that many cancer cells have an increase in the level of HSP90 compared to healthy cells, and that when HSP90 is blocked, levels of proteins that make cancer cells grow drop.<br />Drug makers are currently working on ways to block HSP90, which is known as a promiscuous chaperone protein because it binds to many different cells and receptors in the body. It turns out that those researchers are trying to duplicate what green tea does naturally. Gasiewicz says green tea might modulate HSP-90 in a way that researchers have not seen before.<br />Gasiewicz and his group have shown how dioxin and other substances like cigarette smoke manipulate a major cancer-causing molecule, the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor, which frequently plays a role in turning on genes that are oftentimes harmful.<br />Two years ago the team discovered that AH activity is inhibited by a chemical found in white and green teas, epigallocatechingallate or EGCG, now being produced and marketed as a supplement by DSM.<br />"We initially hypothesized that EGCG would work in the same way as other AH antagonists, by binding directly to it. We were completely surprised that this isn't the case," said Gasiewicz, whose work was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the American Institute for Cancer Research.<br />Instead, the team found that EGCG binds to HSP90, a protein that helps other proteins stay stable, serving the same role as a tail on a kite. When the two bind, HSP90 no longer turns on the AH receptor, stopping the cascade of events that would lead to the activation of several harmful genes.<br />Another potential mechanism for green tea's action was outlined recently by a team at the University of Wisconsin and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. The found that green tea polyphenols reduce levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in prostate tumour cells in a mouse model for human prostate cancer. Increased levels of IGF-1 are associated with higher risk of several cancers, such as prostate, breast, lung and colon.<br />Meanwhile, researchers at Kyushu University in Japan reported last year that EGCG appears to inhibit tumour cell growth by binding to a receptor on cells called the 67-kDa laminin receptor. A variety of tumours produce abnormally high levels of 67 LR, and the receptor is thought to be involved in the spread of cancers through the body.<br /><br />If you have problems completing your update and need to contact customer service, please report the following code with your request<br />Code: 02Oq8o2BBAXAacmKMMMF4TBY<br /><br />Is Green Tea Really an Anti-Cancer Miracle?<br />Talk to your doctor about green tea.<br /><br />By Gale Maleskey, MS, RD<br />Registered Dietitian<br />About the Author<br />July 23, 2009<br /><br />Change Text Size A | A | A<br />If you've had cancer, or a precancerous condition, it's time to talk with your doctor about using green tea extract. More and more research is showing that green tea extract can slow the progression of cancer. It doesn't work for all cancers, but it seems to have a significant effect on some types. Its effect may even depend on genetic markers and hormone sensitivities associated with your type of cancer.<br /><br />Some of the cancers that green tea can face down include prostate, esophageal, bladder, cervical, pancreatic, ovarian, lymphoma and leukemia. Green tea is also active against human papilloma virus (HPV) a sexually transmitted virus associated with cervical and anal cancer and warts.<br /><br />(Since green tea can also apparently neutralize some chemotherapy treatments, such as Velcade, used for multiple myeloma and mantel cell lymphoma, it's important that you consult with your doctor if you are undergoing treatment.)<br /><br />The most recent study, by researchers at Louisiana State University, found that men scheduled for a radical prostatectomy due to cancer who took a green tea extract had a significant reduction in the markers predictive of prostate cancer progression. In some men, the drop was more than 30%! The reductions were in biochemicals that either stimulate cancer growth or indicate continued cancer growth. The men took a total of 1.3 grams of tea polyphenols, equivalent to about 12 cups of green tea. (McLarty, J, et al. Cancer Prev Res. 2009 June 19.) [E Pub ahead of print.]<br /><br />Even though this was a small study, other evidence suggests that green tea can take on cancer. One study found that men with high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia -- cellular changes that often lead to cancer -- who took green tea catechins 200 mg three times daily for a year, had a reduced risk of progression to prostate cancer. (Bettuzzi S, et al. Cancer Res .2006;66:1234-40.)<br /><br />Polyphenols (catechins, such as EGCG) in tea appear to protect cells from DNA damage that can promote cancer. Animal research suggests that the EGCG in green tea may prevent new blood vessel growth in tumors, inhibit tumor cell proliferation, and induce death in cancer cells in at least two different ways.<br /><br />The Anti-Aging Bottom Line: Green tea extract can be an important part of an anti-cancer arsenal. For general prevention, we recommend about 450 mg a day of a standardized green tea extract. Unlike brewed tea and non-standardized green tea extracts, our formula provides consistently high amounts of green tea's most active constituents. If you're being treated for cancer, it's best to talk with your doctor about dosage.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WB1YSE">Kirkland Signature Green Tea Matcha Blend, 100% Japanese Tea Leaves, 100 Tea Bags by A2AWorld Green Tea</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002K2MUUY">Lipton Green Tea - 100% Natural, 2009 New Spring Tea, 50 Fresh Tea Bags from China by A2AWorld Green Tea</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OI9D9K">Tianfang Huangshan Maofeng Green Tea 68g Gift Tin</a>

review/text: This green tea is decent, however, every single tea bag is in its own plastic pouch.  Further, the tea bags themselves are nylon, which they claim enhances the tea somehow.  All of this non-bio-degradable packaging is unnecessary, so you end up tossing everything in the trash can rather than the compost bin.  Next time I'm trying Harney and Sons Japanese Sencha, which I hear is pretty good with a much smaller carbon footprint.

review/text: The matcha content is too low to matter falvor-wise, and the tea itself is sadly incipid. I use only about 5 oz water, and the tea is still too bland, yet with slite bitterness. I much prefer, fo example, Barry's green tea, with no matcha promises, but a strong rich flavor, and a price signifly less than this stuff.  Gonna buy some good quality matcha and add it to green drinks, rather than brew a cuppa 4 or 5 times/day. And just as important, more points off for excess packing. Let's not forget nylon, as in nylon teabags, and that junk sticks around--who needs it!

review/summary: Very Grassy Flavor & Weak Tea
review/text: I bought this green tea from Amazon because of strong reviews. I have tried it twice on two different days, steeped according to directions on the bag the first time and then steeped for 15 minutes the second time. I have to say I hate this tea! Very grassy in flavor and watered-down for what's left over! I am a long-time tea drinker and occasionally buy more expensive loose-leaf green tea from Japan. This Kirkland Matcha blend is NOT high quality green tea. I am giving this tea two stars instead of one because I can understand how people who do not know how to brew tea can complain about its bitter tannic taste. I also give credit to Kirkland for putting more volume of tea in the bags. With this tea, it will never be bitter because the flavor is completely weak! If you've tried something like Bigelow Green tea and hated its bitter taste, you might think this Kirkland Matcha tea is the top of the line. But it is not! First, the Bigelow will never be sweet like authentic loose leaf green tea because it was not dried and packaged correctly. Second, brewing it for longer than 4 minutes will make it dark yellow and bitter. But this Kirkland brand is much worse because it only looks green like the authentic green tea, yet tastes nothing like it! I continue my search for a convenient high-quality green tea and will resort to Bigelow for quick fixes if I can't find anything satisfying in the meantime...

I admit, the smell is quite nice right when you open up the packet.  But once you steep it, all the taste and aroma goes away.  I had to force myself to drink this on three separate occasions just to make sure my taste buds didn't just have an off day or something.  I seriously can't drink this flavorless "tea" anymore and am throwing the rest away.  Good thing it wasn't very expensive.  If there's a Asian grocery store in your area, try out as many brands as you can to get a good sense of good and bad green tea.  I like My Green Tea a lot.  But I don't think they're readily available in most places.

When it's brewed, it does seem a bit like Japanese tea, but not at all like matcha. I'm not even sure what it is. It tastes terrible.<br /><br />If you want to try some good green tea, I suggest Numi brand tea. You should be able to find it at most well stocked supermarkets and health food stores. It is the best boxed tea you can get.

I'm not even sure if it is green tea, it almost tastes like steeped grass.  It is also very weak.  I have to use 3 tea bags to get a decent cup.  I think the other reviewers just see the nylon bag and think, wow, this must be good tea.<br /><br />One other gripe, they make the strings to short on the bags.  They aren't long enough for the tab to hang over the edge of a normal sized coffee cup.  I have to cut the strings off unless I want paper floating in my tea.<br /><br />I would recommend the Stash premium green tea.  It has fantastic flavor and is about the same price as the crappy Kirkland tea.

review/summary: Delicious, fresh green tea blended with maccha powder
review/text: I grew up with green tea (I'm from Japan)- I was always searching for good alternative to the loose green tea (wanted something quick, single serving, easy to clean, and yet tastes good).  Well, my search is over, finally!<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />-Tastes very fresh, the color is very green,<br /> not that yellow-ish green<br /><br />-Added Maccha to enhance the flavor<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-The naming is bit confusing.  I can see why some people order this product, thinking that they are getting the Maccha powder (the one for the tea ceremony).  This is NOT a 100% Maccha poder.  It is a delicious, fresh green tea blended with maccha powder.<br /><br />Quick Tip<br /><br />If your green tea tastes too bitter, the water might be too hot.  The best temperature is around 80C (176F- NOT boiling hot). After pouring the hot water, steep about 30-45 sec, then take the bag out.  You never want to "cook" the green tea.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)

review/summary: Much Cheaper at Costco
review/text: I've been ordering this tea from Amazon and think it tastes fantastic - and I hope it is doing good things for my insides.  If you have a Costco membership, you can get it for just under $13 in the store. I was there yesterday and decided to check - and couldn't believe the price difference! I thought maybe it wasn't the identical item but I confirmed it when I got home.  Now I feel like a fool for paying so much on Amazon. Oh well, live and learn.

review/summary: An excellent Japanese green tea without specialty tea shop prices
review/text: If you've turned your up nose at store brands before, don't do it for this one. Despite its humble Costco labeling, this is a very good and tasty Japanese green tea. That's because it is made by Ito En, Japan's leading tea distributor and one of the country's largest beverage manufacturers. I was surprised to hear of staff members at the Japanese Embassy in DC drinking this tea. It comes highly recommended from a Japanese friend working there.<br /><br />Made from 100% Japan-grown tea, this product also contains "matcha", a finely powdered high grade green tea. It's responsible for the lively green color. The pyramidal nylon bag lets water pass through better, so you get more flavor out of each serving than with traditional flat tea bags.<br /><br />Brewing temperatures for different kinds of tea vary, but to make green tea, the water should be between 70-80ï¿½C, not boiling. With half the caffeine, green tea is better for you than black tea because of the higher concentration of water-soluble antioxidants (cathechins and flavinoids) and vitamin C, which are destroyed by the roasting process. One cup will give you 100%+ of your daily USRDA requirement. Green tea is also great chilled or over ice.

review/summary: Costco green tea is my favorite cheap tea
review/text: My family buys one of these boxes at Costco every month or two.  Kirkland is the Costco house brand, so people selling it here are just buying it at Costco and reselling the boxes at profit. Costco charges $12 per box.<br /><br />This tea has a much stronger flavor that cheap green tea like Lipton. I really like it, but I guess flavor is a personal thing (else no one would buy limp Lipton).<br /><br />Flavor doesn't compare to what you get at a good Japanese restaurant or tea house, but you can only expect so much from 12 cent tea bags.<br /><br />"Matcha blend" means you get a small amount of matcha powder in each tea bag. Make sure you pour that into your cup. Don't throw it out!<br /><br />I'm only giving this 4 stars out of 5 because the price here is so much more expensive than Costco.

review/summary: Very good matcha tea!
review/text: A lot of reviewers are calling this 'green tea' only, and it's not just green tea. Green tea and matcha green tea are very different teas, so the terms are not interchangeable. Matcha is generally a very expensive form of powdered tea used in tea ceremonies. This Kirkland brand is obviously not expensive, but it tastes pretty close to the really good stuff. I have had all kinds of matcha, because it is my favorite kind of tea, and I definitely recommend this tea. It's really quick to steep, less expensive, and doesn't require the whisking needed for real, high end matcha. I definitely still love the good matcha more, but this works for me as well!

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: I've tried many different green teas in the States & abroad.  When I lived in Philadelphia, I had many Japanese friends there who made terrific green tea--but until now I couldn't find one to rival theirs.  This one does.  It's tasty & flavorful, certainly not bitter--even if you steep it overlong.  The bags are interesting too.  My only problem is that the string is attached to the middle of each bag vs. the end--which can be annoying--easier for it to slip into the cup while brewing (esp. if you're using a microwave to heat it) & also if you use a squeezing device to get the brewed tea out of the bag itself before disposing of it.  Still, this minor inconvenience hardly affects the value of this tasteful product.  I'm about to purchase some more.

review/summary: Innovative bag, good quality, low price.
review/text: As others here have mentioned, this is quite a good deal for the quality of the product.<br /><br />By making the bag out of nylon and by attaching the string to the middle of the face of the bag (instead of at the top edge like everyone else), they have made it so that more tea leaves get to touch the water and more tea leaves remain floating and loose in the water. That really seems to help the steeping process.<br /><br />Most tea bags compress the tea leaves together into a big wad which prevents the water from getting to all but the outer most leaves. The solution in that case is to use a spoon to press the tea bag against the cup in order to cause the leaves to separate and become exposed to the hot water. It works, but you end up having to do this a lot if you really want a really good cup of tea.<br /><br />Instead, this bag floats on its face, edge-wise. And that causes the tea leaves to stay loose and not bunch up as much. The result is that more leaves are exposed to hot water, and so the tea itself will be richer. You just need to use the string to tug at it to shake up the leaves every now and then. No spoon is ever needed.<br /><br />Another thing they've done is to add a little notch to the square paper thingy at the end of the string. The idea is that you can stick the paper onto the lip of your cup really easily that way, and it holds on to the cup instead of dangling outside of it. That's kind of neat.<br /><br />The tea this produces is very green colored. Some of my coworkers actually thought there might be food coloring added to the tea leaves. They've never seen truly green tea.<br /><br />I would compare this tea favorably with The Republic of Tea's "Double Green Matcha Tea". Both products combine a small amount of matcha green tea powder along with the green tea leaves. In my opinion, the Republic of Tea's product is a bit bolder (which I like) but also more bitter (which I don't like). The Kirkland Signature / Ito En Matcha Blend has absolutely no bitterness. I wouldn't call it "sweet" like others have, either. I think it's just more refined and maybe fresher than the Republic of Tea's version.<br /><br />No, there isn't a lot of matcha powder in this tea. I didn't expect there to be a lot of matcha. About 99% of it is normal green tea leaves. There's a powdery residue in the bag itself (which you should tap a few times to empty out into your cup as the instructions say). And there's probably some matcha powder mixed in with the tea leaves. But don't expect much. It improves the flavor of the tea, but it's not like pure matcha, nor does it advertise itself as such.<br /><br />About the only negative thing I have to say about the product is that the strings on the tea bags are too small for me. They're always falling into the cup. Then again, I don't use a standard tea cup to drink. And because my cup is thicker than an average tea cup, the innovative notch that's in the square paper thing at the end of the string is too small and won't stay on the lip of the cup. Bummer. As a result, I have to be careful to make sure the string doesn't fall back into the cup. But it's a minor thing.<br /><br />I'd also like to see a better way of packaging these tea bags. They're all individually wrapped in sealed plastic bags. This prevents oxidation and spoilage, which is great. But it also produces a lot of waste, which is a pity.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed with the quality of this green tea at this price. I will definitely order it again when I run out. It also makes a perfect gift for anyone you know who loves quality green tea.<br /><br />Hope that helps.

review/text: I've always preferred coffee to tea, but I'm aware of the many claimed health benefits of green tea. My wife is Russian and prefers tea, but she drinks Earl Gray and types like that and doesn't care for green tea. Well, we were strolling through our local Costco Warehouse store and a lady offered us a small cup of green tea. We both took one. I thought it was quite good. My wife said it was the best green tea she had tasted. We walked away from the little display with a packet of Kirkland Signature Green Tea (100 bags).<br /><br />Now, what are we ever going to do with all this tea? Well, we use it bit by bit and the supply is gradually lowering. Guests take it and it seems to please them all. I'm trying to drink it now and then for increasing my anti-oxidents. Hmmmm. Maybe I'll eventually be a tea lover. In any case, this is an excellent green tea.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: This tea is great for the price, health benefits, and ease of making.  I have been searching for a green tea that tastes great for the anti-oxidant content.  This is it. A couple of bonuses....<br />Health Benefits - This tea contains matcha. Matcha is a powder that has a higher anti-oxidant concentration than other green tea that is not called matcha.<br />Ease of making - let the tea bag steep in the water for 20-30 seconds.  shake it three times and throw away the tea bag.  Do not squeeze the water out of the tea bag.  You've already gotten all the flavor and antioxidants from the tea.  Then take the pouch the tea bag came in and turn upside down on top of your cup and flick a couple of times to add the powder that was left in the pouch to your tea.  You now have the best green tea for the price.  Make sure to drink the powder that is left in the bottom of the cup.  That is where some of the anti-oxidants are.

review/summary: The best authentic green tea in the States
review/text: I bleed Japanese green tea and have lamented that no authentic stuff has been available in the States (unless you live close to Japanese grocery shop like Mitsuwa).  I cannot stand the fake, "flavored" green tea so abundantly found in the shelves of regular supermarkets.<br /><br />Well, I think my eternal search may be over, thanks to Kirkland!  What I like about this tea is that it *is* authentic Japanese green tea.  Sure, this is not of gyokuro kind, and you don't get the extra kick and aroma that you can easily feel with more expensive green tea, but when there is basically no authentic green tea available in the States, what can you expect?  I'm so grateful that I can just have the same products that you find on the shelves of grocery shops in Japan.<br /><br />I am so happy that I can stock this up in my office and home at such a cheap price.  Well done!

review/text: Conveniently packaged in single bag packets.  Loving the nylon bag and the little slit on the end of the string to hook on the edge of cup.<br /><br />Taste is great--very smooth and not bitter.  Like all green teas, it can easily be ruined by steeping too long or using water that is too hot.  Best results are obtained by steeping for just 30-60 seconds and by using water at 175 degrees F (80 C).  The proper temperature can be easily achieved by using one part room temperature water to three parts boiling water.<br /><br />Overall a great value.

review/summary: Delicious green tea
review/text: I have been buying this green tea for years at Costco and just discovered that it was available on Amazon.<br /><br />Drinking tea, like drinking coffee, involves lots of personal preferences. For me this particular green tea has taste and flavor that easily beats anything I can find in the supermarket, which is why I have been buying it for years. If you like green tea then this is a very good choice whether you drink it hot, cold, unsweetened, or sweetened with honey (which in hot tea works great to sooth a sore throat or cough from a cold). I drink a cup every day and look forward to it.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is an economical way to drink something delicious that is good for you.

review/summary: This is my new favorite tea
review/text: I've loved Japanese green tea my whole life and have not found one yet that tastes as good as this one at this price, except for cups of tea served in Japanese restaurants. A couple reviews here mentioned how it compares to gourmet green tea.  I don't know what classifies a tea as gourmet, unless it's the price, and I don't know if I've ever had such a tea. But this Kirkland tea is so flavorful that I don't see why it matters whether it is gourmet class or not. It only matters that it tastes great, and it smells wonderful too. Even my spouse, who drank green tea only occasionally (and usually prefers Earl Grey), is thrilled with this tea and now drinks it almost every night. Don't worry about finding a better bargain.  It's only 19 cents a bag through Amazon, so what difference does it make if you can get it a few pennies cheaper elsewhere?  With such a great flavor, it's a bargain at almost any price.<br /><br />This tea has a wonderful grassy flavor -- the mark of a good green tea -- that is missing in so many commercial brands, and even many Asian brands you find here (and the tea is actually green, which isn't the case with all "green" teas).  Chinese green tea looks and tastes different from Japanese green tea -- less green and less grassy in flavor.  The box says there is green tea powder added, which must be part of the reason for the rich flavor.  The instructions say to add the excess powder inside the wrapper to your water. Generally, over-steeping green tea leaves it tasting bitter, but this one doesn't seem to get bitter when I do (any purist will tell you that adding sweetener or lemon to green tea is just not acceptable ;-).<br /><br />Each teabag is individually wrapped in a plastic pouch. The teabags themselves are nylon, which is stronger than the usual paper and less likely to tear. I admit I am a bit conflicted about buying this tea because I love the flavor, but the environmentalist in me is disappointed the bags and wrappers are not biodegradable. I also wonder if I should be concerned that it's not organic, but  I may never find out if it matters.

review/text: Having tried a multitude of loose & bagged green teas of all stripes and colors, this one is the winner by a landslide. I've had many cups of Matcha & Sencha but never together. That combination is a synergystic blend if there ever was one. The sencha/matcha combo is grassy and sweet at the same time. After a steep of 1 minute the tea turned a nice translucent emerald green color. It was also suggested to tap the empty foil wrapper over your cup to sprinkle the remaining matcha residue into your cup. The tea is invigorating, vegetal, grassy and slightly sweet.<br />I rate this amongst the best I have tried. Ito En is a well known Japanese company. I previously tried their bottled line of iced teas and the unsweetened green tea with mint was so very very good. It's worth buying this premium tea online. I have heard Costco stocks this under the Kirkland brand but I am not a member there so cannot confirm this.

review/summary: Weight Loss Benefits of Green Tea
review/text: Weight Loss Benefits of Green Tea<br />=================================<br /><br />If you drink green tea you can-<br />* Lower Cholesterol<br />* Increase Thermogenesis (the body's rate of burning calories)<br />* Enhance fat oxidation<br /><br />Burns Fat Naturally<br />Green tea contains high concentrations of catechin polyphenols. These compounds work with other chemicals to intensify levels of fat oxidation and thermogenesis, where heat is created in the body by burning fuels such as fat. Drinking Japanese green tea regularly will increase your metabolism and help burn fat safely and naturally.<br /><br />Lowers cholesterol and increases energy expenditure<br />Green tea also causes carbohydrates to be released slowly, preventing sharp increases in blood-insulin levels. This promotes the burning of fat.<br />The thermogenic effect was originally attributed to its caffeine content. However, green tea stimulates brown fat thermogenesis far greater than a comparable amount of pure caffeine. It appears that the catechin-polyphenols, in particular epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and caffeine that naturally occur in green tea work synergistically to stimulate thermogenesis and augment and prolong sympathetic stimulation of thermogenesis. It has been shown to increase 24-hour energy expenditure and fat oxidation (caffeine only increases metabolism during the time you take it).<br /><br />Weight is gained as excess sugars and fats are stored in the body as fat cells. Green tea catechins can help prevent obesity by inhibiting the movement of glucose in fat cells. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has been found to be especially effective. There is now good evidence that green tea catechins are related to reductions in body fat.<br />EGCG is a powerful antioxidant with positive qualities but a balanced diet and exercise, lots of it, are of paramount importance to any weight reduction program.<br /><br />Green Tea and Weight Loss<br />=========================<br />by: Kathryn O'Neill<br /><br />There's recently been a LOT in the weight loss news concerning green tea.<br />Green tea's weight loss effects have been causing more and more people to start sipping the ancient Chinese or Japanese brew.<br /><br />But just how does green tea help you lose weight? And does it really work or is it all just hype? This article gives you the real facts about drinking green tea to lose weight.<br />Advantages of Drinking Green Tea for Weight Loss:<br /><br />1) Green tea revs up your metabolism<br /><br />A study reported on in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that green tea extract resulted in a significant increase in energy expenditure (a metabolism `boost').<br />The researchers also concluded that that over a 24-hour period, green tea extract increases the metabolic rate by 4%. These effects are probably due to the high concentrations of catechin polyphenols found in green tea. These work to help intensify levels of fat oxidation and thermogenesis (the rate at which your body burns calories).<br /><br />2) Green tea inhibits fat absorption and helps glucose regulation<br />Experts tell us that the catechins in green tea help to inhibit the movement of glucose into fat cells. Green tea may also act as al glucose regulator. It helps to slow the rise in blood sugar after a meal. This prevents high insulin spikes (lots of insulin promotes fat storage) and the subsequent fat storage.<br /><br />3) Green tea may help reduce appetite<br />Scientists at the University of Chicago found that green tea caused rats to lose up to 21 percent of their body weight. Rats injected with a green tea extract lost their appetites and consumed up to 60 percent less food after seven days of daily injections. This may have something to do with the blood sugar regulating effects of green tea.<br /><br />4) Green tea can help you save calories on your morning brew.<br />We are a nation hooked on our java. Be it the regular double-cream, double-sugar standard or that mocha, dappa, frappucinno, the calories we ingest just to get our morning caffeine is wreaking havoc on our waistlines.<br /><br />If you want to save mega-calories in the morning but still get your caffeine fix, try substituting green tea for coffee. Or have a green tea in the afternoon instead of that 700 calorie mocha-chillate dream. You'll definitely notice the difference in your waistline after a few weeks.<br /><br />So there are 4 ways that green tea can help you with weight loss. But how much do you actually have to drink to get these amazing metabolism boosting effects?<br /><br />Experts vary but the general consensus seems to be that 3 - 5 cups of green tea per day is optimal. Doing this can help you burn an extra 70 calories per day which amounts to 7 pounds per year. Pretty good for not exercising or cutting calories, right?<br />However, 3 - 5 cups can be a lot for some people, so you might also want to consider green tea extract, green tea pills or a green tea patch.<br /><br />Disadvantages of Drinking Green Tea For Weight Loss:<br />#1) Green tea is not a magic bullet<br />While some people will tell you that green tea is the be-all-end-all for weight loss success, I think the keyword here is balance. You're not going to eat 5000 calories a day, drink a cup of green tea and make it all go away - it just isn't going to happen. A healthy diet and increased exercise will go a long way in helping you lose weight and keep it off.<br />#2) Be cautious of the caffeine if you have health problems<br />For some people that have heart troubles, high blood pressure or stimulant sensitivities, the caffeine in green tea may not be the best idea. If you're worried about the caffeine from green tea, try taking green tea extract. Most green tea extract is made from decaffeinated green tea so you can still get the weight loss benefits without the caffeine.<br />If you think the caffeine may be a problem, make sure to consult your doctor before starting green tea for weight loss. Also make sure to consult your doctor before starting green tea if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.<br /><br />*** Bottom Line ***: Green tea helps you with weight loss by boosting your metabolic rate, regulating your blood sugar, suppressing your appetite and giving you something else besides that high calorie, high sugar coffee beverage to drink in the morning. While it's not the magic bullet, it can definitely give you a boost in weight loss and in your overall health!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OI9D9K">Tianfang Huangshan Maofeng Green Tea 68g Gift Tin</a><br />&lt;the end>

review/summary: Taste to value ratio is fine, surprizingly good taste!
review/text: I have never been a friend of tea in bags, but this one I really like.And only one tea I drink in bags without complaining.<br />(And I should add the bags are nice nylon and separately packaged). Of course if you drink the very expensive green Japanese loose teas,prepared in a traditional way, this one is of course not way such a great taste as expensive macha with bright green color.<br /><br />But I am not such gourmet. Nor I have been in Japan. This one is good for me, nice taste, ( slightly dry green and has sweetness of rice), nice color. Of course the  water can't be too hot, or bag shouldn't stay for longer than 30 sec.And water needs to be filtered for better taste,as water can spoil so much.<br />The price for the taste is in my opinion really good, and this one is my daily tea,it is not fancy, yet really good. This matcha is  a blend, so, we don't know from which region it comes, is generic, but I don't mind.<br />Again, it is not a gourmet tea, and I gave five stars for being special in its class: inexpensive teas in bags. Also excellent tea to introduce green tea haters into drinking green ones. (Many people don't like certain aftertastes, this one is mellow enough and fresh tasting).

review/text: As a Chinese who drank kinds of green tea, I highly recommend this tea for 2 reasons. 1, the tea is made of very famous and expensive green tea, which is called Dragon Well in China. This kind of tea smells very differently from other normal green tea. 2, the sealed plastic bag outside of each tea bag reserve the tea freshness and smell.

review/text: This is a good green tea, but only has a light sprinkling of matcha powder that you put in the tea after you have removed the tea bag.  The tea bag is just normal green tea.  For those looking for a pure matcha tea, than you would not like this.  If just looking for a Japanese green tea, then this is fine.  I got mine from Costco not from here, but same thing.  Can't opine on the price.

review/summary: I AM FINALLY A GREEN TEA LOVER!
review/text: Green tea is suppose to be the best tea for you. I have tried many and just did not like them at all. Then I tried Republic of Tea Matcha Tea. Expensive but pretty good whenI brewed it WITH a black tea bag as well. But, I figured I was getting the green tea in there so better that way than not at all. I decided to check Amazon to see if I could get that tea cheaper and it is there that I found the reviews for this tea. I just got the box this week and I am so happy. I don't need to brew the black tea with it. It is GOOD! Very good. And a lot cheaper than Republic of Tea. (The price of this tea seems to fluctuate, though. It has actually dropped in price since I ordered it 4 days ago by $5.00. Wonder why?)

review/summary: Green tea tastes great!
review/text: I bought this on amazon because I lack the Costco membership and time to drive to the nearest costco store in my area. I read the reviews and decided to try out this green tea. The green tea came out perfect when I followed the simple instructions on the back of each tea packet. The smell is very light and pleasant. The taste, in my opinion, was not too bitter and the tea came out just right after steeping for 30 seconds in hot water.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with my purchase and if you can I would recommend buying this at the store because it may be cheaper (make sure to take into account the tax as well).<br /><br />Cheers!

review/text: I spent 3+ decades of my life in Japan, and I drank lots of green tea including this Ito En brand. This Matcha (finely-milled green tea which is used for tea ceremony) blend is one of my favorites. The manufacturer advertises in Japanese that you can enjoy two cups of tea with one tea bag without losing the great taste and flavor, which I think is true. $12.99 for 100 bags is a very good deal for real Japanese green tea!

review/text: This kirkland imported tea from japan is good. But do note it is more like green tea leaf tea and not "matcha" like it tries to state on the label, it is more like a hybrid of both. Real matcha tea is green tea leafs pounded into a fine powder and is quite expensive for good quality. There is nothing wrong with green tea leafs but matcha will have more nutritional value since it is powdered and drank in full while your just extracting from green tea leafs.

Incidentally, this tea has changed the way I look at Kirkland Signature products. Cheers Costco!

It's very inexpensive and the tea bags make it convenient to make compared with loose teas.<br /><br />It helps to read the directions because this tea only needs to be steeped for 30 seconds. And like other green teas you should use water that is not too hot to keep from burning it and causing it to be bitter.

review/summary: A decent cup of green tea, even better iced
review/text: While I wouldn't describe myself as a tea connoisseur, I am a regular tea drinker. I like both green and black teas. I buy the Kirkland Signature Green Tea Matcha blend especially for brewing iced tea: 5-7 tea bags in cold water left overnight in the refrigerator, remove tea bags, and serve with or without ice. I find it needs no sweetener or lemon. Tea bags left longer than 24 hours will make the tea bitter and the matcha sediment can also become bitter.<br /><br />There are other teas I like better, such as a Gen Mai Cha or a high quality Jasmine tea. For the price, the Kirkland brand is just fine and reliably available at Costco.

review/summary: Very Green, Very Flavorful!
review/text: As someone trying to replace my coffee addiction with something healthier (but still caffeinated!), I was very pleased to find this product in my local Costco for fifteen dollars.  I was somewhat skeptical, as I have always found green teas to be somewhat unremarkable, but this product is excellent.  It is aromatic, flavorful, and makes me feel like I am ingesting something healthy!  If you buy this tea, you will not be disappointed.  If you do not live near a Costco, $23 is not a terrible price for this tea - that's only $0.23 a bag.  Just don't forget to tap the remaining matcha in the packet onto your tea . . . it enhances the flavor of the product.
