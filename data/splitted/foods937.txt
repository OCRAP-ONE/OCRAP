review/summary: Yummy, Chewy Salmon treats
review/text: My mother-in-law gave me a couple of these to share with my Boston Terribles and my older Bichon.  They gobble them up.  They're chewy and satisfying, and best of all, made with real salmon, so the Omega-6's are included.  I highly recommend.

review/summary: Too runny!
review/text: This product does not work well at all.  We bought black and orange to decorate Halloween cookies.  Even without microwaving the bottle, as the directions suggest to make the product softer, the liquid just poured out.  We kneaded the icing and shook the bottle repeatedly thinking that the icing must have separated, but no.  The icing was so runny, it just ran off the cookies and looks terrible.  I do not see how this product could be used to make lines, as the image on the bottle suggests.  We also tried making black dots for eyes, and the icing just spread into black blobs.  Don't waste your money.

review/summary: Appears to be culinary grade - good - but not higher grade
review/text: The grade of this organic matcha was not noted in the description. From the price and the size (3 oz) I surmised it would be culinary grade. It appears it is. I have been drinking higher grade (and more expensive) matcha for a long time and opened this package (a metal air sealed packet within a nice metal can to compare. This matcha is more of a split pea soup color compared to the bright green of the higher grade matcha. The taste is different too. Hard to describe the taste. Good, but not the great of the higher grade. I just had to buy this to compare since this matcha is much more economical. I will use this straight as a tea in a pinch, but will relegate this more toward cooking, baking, smoothies -- where the higher grade would be "wasted." Well presented in a nice container. Quality matcha just not the higher grade used in ceremonies and the quality I use in my practice for drinking by itself. The only reason for the 4 star rather than 5 star review is that the grade was not disclosed in the description, or even on the packaging. If "culinary" was disclosed, this would be a 5 star review.

review/summary: Liquid Jade is fairly good,  but high cost
review/text: This morning I taste-tested 3 top-rated Matcha green teas that I recently purchased on Amazon.<br /><br />1. Serendipi Tea matcha culinary grade organic green tea from Japan, 4 oz. costs $17.43<br />(result: *****)<br /><br />2. Tea Zone matcha green tea powder, 8 oz. costs $16.99 (Amazon sells this as `Matcha Green Tea Powder By Malden Tea', but my black foil packaging label says it's made by Tea Zone)<br />(result: ****)<br /><br />3. Liquid Jade powdered matcha green tea 100% organic, 3 oz. Cost $18.46<br />(result: ***)<br /><br />Recipe:<br />I made 3 different cups of  `green tea latte' with the following method:<br />1 tsp tea powder,<br />mixed with filtered water into a smooth paste,<br />added to 1/3 cup hot soymilk + 1/3 cup boiling water + 1 tsp raw agave nectar,<br />frothed into a Latte-style tea with hand-pump device.<br />NOTE: I am a scientist.  Each cup was clearly labeled.  I tasted the teas side-by-side, taking 3 sips of each before proceeding to next sample.  I tasted in random order until all 3 cups were consumed.  Total time: 15 minutes.  I took lots of notes and drew graphs etc.<br /><br />Result:<br />Serendipi Tea (5+ stars)  won for sweet smooth flavor, amazing long lasting froth bubbles, and the fact it's organic!!  Cost: $4.30/oz but worth it.  Note on the packaging: For those reviewers complaining of the green tea powder leaking, I have to point out that it's hand packed, with a note explaining that you must pack it yourself in an airtight and light-blocking container.  Fine with me, since this is the best tea I've found, and the act of packing it myself is itself a ZEN moment in which I feel a connection to the individual soul who packed the brown bag by hand just for me.  You decide.<br /><br />Tea Zone (Malden Tea) (4+ stars) came in second for a very nice flavor, but the frothy bubbles popped sooner than the Serendipi Tea, making for a lower rating, and plus, it isn't organic.  But it gets extra points for its low cost:  $2.12/oz (can't beat this price for a daily tea).<br /><br />Liquid Jade (3 stars) was an O.K. tea, ever-so-slightly more bitter than the other two I taste tested, and almost a chalky feeling (perhaps it was ground into larger particles than the other teas).  Yes it's organic, always a plus, but at a cost of $6.15/oz, no way will I buy this again when I can get TeaZone 4 stars for a third this cost, and Serendipi Tea 5 stars for significantly less money as well.  'Au revoir' Liquid Jade (though I do love your container and I'll save it.)

review/summary: Not Worth It
review/text: First of all, the color of the powder is an "old" yellowish-green, not the bright green of fresh matcha. After whisking, the foam was "pebbly", not fine and even as it should be. The flavor was so nasty and bitter that I threw it out after one sip. During my evaluation of the dry powder, I thought that it might serve OK in cooking, but after sipping the bowl of tea, I was reluctant to even introduce it to the compost heap.

Difficult to dissolve. Less favorable flavor and not organic<br /><br />Uwajimaya has best selection of Matcha teas with several others I have not tried yet. Whole Foods carries both DO and Tao of Tea. New Seasons currently does not carry Matcha. Serendipi is available on Amazon for $17/4 oz. box, best tea for your money!

For a more crunchy and spicy alternative, I've been considering Dakota's blazin' hot or Azar's spicy lime kernels.

review/text: I have been a Starbucks French Roast "addict" ever since Starbucks opened. That said, I have been advised to severely limit the amount of caffeine I consume, so I have had to look for Decaf french roast coffee.  Until I tasted Jeremiah's Pick French Roast, everything paled in comparison to the Starbucks French Roast (they don't make a Decaf FR).  Jeremiah's Pick decaf is as close as you will get to that real arabica dark roast flavor I've always enjoyed with Starbucks -- you'll get that full rich french roast aroma and taste as you take your first sip.  It's a winner, and as loyal a Starbuck's customer as I have been, I sense a real change in the wind. . . . .  Jerimiah has won my heart!

review/summary: I can't believe it is decaf
review/text: I was in search of an alternative to Starbucks French roast coffee - i am no longer able to drink it, i tried many different kinds of coffees - no acids, decaf and then read a review from a man who indicated that this coffee satisfied his craving for Starbucks French Roast that he also could no longer drink, so I decided to give it a try; He was right, it is hard to believe that this is a decaf coffee, it satisfies my craving for that rich full body taste that Starbucks French roast provides and none of the after effects of heartburn or acid reflux; it is awesome. My wife who continues to drink the Starbucks is easily fooled as to which coffee she is drinking - if you have hesitancy - just go for it, give this one a try, you won't regret it;<br /><br />gator-golfer

review/summary: Great tasting decaf
review/text: Like another reviewer here, I love Starbucks French Roast but drink decaf in the evening and 50/50 caf/decaf blend most of the rest of the time. I have been looking for a great tasting french roast decaf that is wonderful on its own and blends well with the Starbucks.  This is it!<br /><br />This coffee does not taste exactly like the Starbucks, but it is certainly close.<br /><br />The price is good and with subscribe and save, it is downright cheap.

review/summary: Sorry to have a write a negative review
review/text: I bought this coffee when someone wrote it was almost as good as Starbuck's French Roast high test.  It was not even close.  Comparing the grounds, Starbucks was a dark brown (as in dark roast), while Jeremiah's was a medium-light brown.  After trying to get used to it by using 1/2 the bag, I decided to email the company (as it said on the bag - money back guarentee) to ask for my money back for the two remaining bags which I would have been happy to send to them. They responded by saying I should take it up with Amazon.  Not real good customer service for a small company trying to get larger.  Needless to say, I won't be buying any coffee from them in the future.  I read some place that one unsatisfied customer can lose a business 25 customers.  We'll see.  I have since bought some Trader Joes Decaf French Roast (in the soft bag, not the round container).  It wasn't as good as Starbucks high test, but it was fair superior to Jeremiah's.

review/text: Those guys out West can live on a vegan diet, but if you're like me you hate most veggies. V8 is good for catching up on your servings, if you like liquified ketchup.<br /><br />But finally, there is a solution. This drink has a lot of servings of both fruits and veggies, and you can't even taste the vegetables. Instead, it tastes like a berry drink. Plus it isn't sweetened with corn syrup or any of that junk. All the sugars are natural.<br /><br />So get this if you need some veggies in your life.

review/summary: No veggie flavor.  Kids love it.
review/text: Our family loves V-Fusion.  It's one way to get fruits and vegetables into the kids without a fight, probably because the vegetable flavors are so well disguised.  Pomegranate/blueberry flavor is delicious.  It's somewhat thick, not watered down at all.  It's a little tart but not too much.  I can taste the carrots and tomatoes, but I think the kids can't pick that out.  It's more overwhelmingly blueberry and pomegranate.  Among all the V-Fusion flavors, my kids like strawberry/banana best, but we buy pomegranate/blueberry for variety.  I personally like them all.

review/summary: Perfect juice if you want real flavor
review/text: I have never been a big juice drinker and in years past I always thought of tomato juice when someone mentioned a V8.  However, after my 2 year old grandson came to live with me and I was in the market for a good juice for him (he has so many allergies!) I stumbled upon the V8 line and thought I'd give it a try.  He really likes it....then I found that I love the flavor(s) too so now I order it in bulk quantities.  This particular Pomegranate Blueberry is one of our favorites.  I also love the Pomegranate with green tea.  I am now a V8 fan!!

review/summary: Very healthy, rich, and good
review/text: We saw these on sale at Publix and they are very rich in taste. Particularly this fusion. It's very dark, smooth, and berry-like. When I started to drink this stuff, and lots of it, I started to really feel better. I didn't eat a lot of my fruits anyway, I know I wasn't getting the intake. But this has helped me. I also notice myself actually going to the bathroom more often (which is a good thing... if you don't go everyday something is wrong).<br /><br />What I also like about these V8 fusions, is that they don't have High Fructose Corn Syrup. Some V8 juices did have it, which is very disappointing. I think it's the Splashes that have it so beware if you want a healthy drink.

review/text: The chips are very delicious. They of course has a hint of vegetable taste, and that is because obviously they are made of vegetables. We are on the gluten free diet and specific carbohydrate diet, so the only thing that is "bad" is the potato and potato starch ingredients, but that is only a very little amount and I am just happy to find a snack that is gluten free and low in carbs. Much, much better than potato chips.<br /><br />I give this a 4 instead of a 5 because the labelling does not clearly indicate if there could be any gluten contamination, if good manufacturing processes are used to seggregate ingredients. My son has recovered from autism and he has to be on a strict gluten free diet, so this kind of information would be very important to us.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this product. This is a much better alternative to snacking than potato or corn chips.

review/summary: Interesting....
review/text: I'm not really sure what to say about these.  No one in my house would eat the things after trying just one.  They're like deep frying your broccoli after you've sliced it into a wavy potato chip form.  They taste like veggies too so don't buy these with the idea that they'll taste just like a bag of Conn's potato chips - they won't.  They're not bad but again, you'll definitely need some dip with these boys.  I got mine on sale and I had a coupon to boot. But I highly doubt that I'll buy them again.

review/summary: Tasty chip, though WAY 2 XPENSIVE
review/text: As mentioned in the above title, its a tasty chip, though WAY TO XPENSIVE. Due to the cost, this is an occasional purchase.<br />For myself an even TASTIER chip would be the POPCHIPS. They taste more like a chip unlike the above, there is starchy after taste.<br />I am not negating that these are tasty in their own right, it's just my personal & automatic choice would be the popchips brand.

review/summary: Acquired taste
review/text: As a vegetarian, I'm always searching for healthy, good food in random retail stores or health food stores. These were $2.78 in Walmart and I figured, "Why not?" The problem is even though it said "veggie crisps," I still went in with the mindset that they'd taste somewhat like chips. Fat chance. I like raw vegetables better than cooked ones so eating them as dry "crisps" just wasn't for me. I think if I drowned them in ketchup, they'd be all right, but at this moment, I'm trying to give them away. I'm definitely not buying these again, but I'm sure somebody somewhere will enjoy them so I won't waste them.

review/text: I bought these as soon as I saw them, because organic candy is rare and scarce.  I wasn't sure on the taste, but as soon as I ate them, I was blown away.  They are so delicious!  I love it when they are "harder" and chewier.  These are the best gummy bears I've ever tasted period.  I am so glad that this company exists!  Family loves these as well, and the bags don't last long in our household.  Love them!

review/text: I found these in a local market a while ago, and fell in love with them, but hadn't been able to find them anywhere in person for a while.  Saw that they were available on Amazon, and ordered a 12-pack.  What arrived is completely different from the product I bought in the store.  The ones I bought at the store were firm but chewy, even-textured, with a nice fruity flavor.  The ones that arrived are crusty on the outside, soft on the inside; the crustiness really makes it hard for me to enjoy the flavor.  I feel bad for wasting food, but I don't think I can stomach these.

review/text: I took a chance on these Yummy Earth candies and am pleased to say that they really are good.  Most flavors were liked by the children although the mango tango was a bit too tangy for some.  As usual, you get what you pay for and I hope more people try them so that the factory can produce more and hopefully bring the price down.  Overall a good product that you won't feel guilty giving your children or eating yourself.

review/summary: overly chewy, not soft, but tasty
review/text: I bought mine at Whole Foods.  They're organic gummies but they're too sticky & too chewy and hard and not soft like the nonorganic Black Forest gummi Bears.  As far as taste, they taste like dehydrated fruit snacks - sweet and tasty, much tastier than the usual mainstream nonorganic gummies.  One good thing is unlike the usual mainstream gummies, you're not putting fructose corn syrup into your body.<br /><br />I bought them again at Marshall's to see if it just wasn't a quality control issue since I had bought the last bag at Whole Foods.  Well, the ones at Marshall's were ALSO hard and chewy.  If you like haribo's gummy bears which are also chewy, then these will be fine, but I prefer the corn syrup laden Jelly Belly's VERY soft gummmy bears<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IKCQ86">Jelly Belly Gummi Bears, Assorted Flavors, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a> or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JZEABG">Black Forest-Gummy Bears, 6lb. bag</a>.<br /><br />A better alternative to YummyEarth is Surf Sweets gummy bears <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIVCW">Surf Sweets Gummy Bears, 2.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> which has the soft consistency of Black Forest and Jelly Belly but is<br />"Organic fruit juice, natural colors and flavors, free of Corn Syrup and GMO's, nut free, and gluten free."

review/summary: inconsistent texture but nice flavor
review/text: Based on the other reviews I was hoping for a nice firm textured gummy but only some of them are really chewy, the others are mushy. They all have a great flavor (although there are only three flavors). I'm not sure if the issue is the heat, it's July on the gulf coast so the problem may be that they were exposed to high heat while being delivered. I don't feel too bad about it since the amazon price was so low. If the texture would be consistent and they added in a few more flavors they would be five stars.

review/text: Do you love gummy bears but hate the high fructose corn syrup or the regular corn syrup?  Or are you allergic to corn?  These gummy bears are for you.  I'd picked some up at Whole Foods right before Halloween and hoped they were going to be tasty.  I opened one of the small packets and tasted one.  I had to double check the package that there was no corn.  These are so good and taste just like the gummy bears you remember.  I had to come here and order this 12 pack so I could have more as well as give some away for Christmas.  I will recommend these to anyone who enjoys a tasty gummy bear.

review/summary: Tasty but too chewy and hard
review/text: I was excited to try these as I found them on sale and the flavors sounded yummy!  I didn't even finish my first package of them.  Our family MUCH prefers Annies Homegrown Organic Bunny Fruit Snacks.  These were fruit tasting, yes, but much harder and chewier than Annies.  Annies flavor is superior as well, I think.  Perhaps I got a bad batch of Yummy Earth Organic Gummy Bears, but I don't enjoy fruit snacks that are hard and almost rubbery.  Annies are much softer and somehow "juicier" tasting.  In my opinion.  But as an alternative to the chemically laden and processed fruit snacks out there they are a much better choice!  I'll be sticking with Annies brand, however.

review/summary: Bad and Good news
review/text: So the Good news first is that these are great alternatives to the traditional fruit snacks, that are loaded in refined sugars. They tasted fresh and were similar to the Haribo Gummy Bears. The first box I bought were perfect, chewy and fresh, no issues.<br /><br />The Bad News: the second time I got some they were white and crusty sugar like on the outside and kind of tasted funny. I also saw these sold in my local markets, however, they all had the white crusty look to them, so I didn't buy them. I'm dissapointed in the quality, and hopes that Yummy earth can do something to be consistent with the product because it really is fantastic, when done correctly.<br /><br />These will also melt on a very warm day which I discovered when I had some on my purse on a warm day at a baseball game. All the bears melted together into a mass blob.

review/summary: Good the first time but stale the second time
review/text: We bought a package of these gummy bears in the store once and they were excellent but expensive. When we saw them on Amazon we bought the 12 pack right away because good organic candy is hard to come by. The first box was excellent, just like they were in the store - chewy with a very good gummy candy texture. We bought a second box 2 months later and they were delivered the other day, and every package looked the same - dry/crusty on the outside of the gummy bears. We opened and tried one package and they were soft and mushy with a sugary crust on the outside and the color was pale. They were shipped in the Texas heat part of the way and this seems to be a common theme on these reviews with gummy bears turning up crusty and bad, so beware!

review/text: I've been using this mix for years, but in order to get the kind of scone I love - more British than anything else - I don't follow their recipe.  Simply take the mix from the box, add heavy cream instead of water or milk, and flour your board with a half and half mixture of flour and granulated sugar.  After you've formed your scones and put them on a cookie sheet, let it sit for about 10 minutes (to allow rising) before you put it into the oven.  You will be amazed at how much better these scones will be than anything you've ever had before.
