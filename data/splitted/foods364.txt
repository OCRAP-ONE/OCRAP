review/summary: Like shirataki noodles, this is a winner
review/text: Based in part on the helpful reviews I found here, I tried a jar. I mixed it with jelly and came up with the perfect filling for pb&j sandwiches. Next up, Pad Thai with shirataki fettucini noodles. I find the flavor is good, and the powder a little gritty until mixed with something wet. When I travel on long road trips, I often carry pb&j makings and fruit for a quick, inexpensive and easy lunch. This will be a nice, lightweight addition to my travel food stores.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: While the fat in peanut butter is not all that bad for you, the calories can add up when trying to lose weight.  This powder was surprisingly good.  Mixed with the water on the directions, it tasted wonderful.  No added sugars, and minus the fat.  Great for smoothies, and drinks where you want that flavor without the calories.  I will be ordering again, and trying it in some recipes.  Only negative is that the 6.5 oz can is very small, and I will be buying a larger one next time.

review/summary: GUILT-FREE PeanutButter!  Who Knew?
review/text: This is a GREAT alternative to peanutbutter for those watching fat, carbs or calories.  Comparing 190 calories for 2 TBLS to 15 calories for PB2, is unbelievable.  I've even bought this as a gift for ladies working to slim down before weddings.  My husband can add as much as he cares to his protein shakes and I mix it for an apple dip.  I tastes like peanutbutter, because IT IS.  They have just pressed the fat out.  Definite staple for the shelf.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I like the PBS chocolate powdered peanut butter even better.

review/summary: Quality product, but expensive
review/text: The powdered peanut butter really does taste like peanut butter, but a bit saltier.  You can change the consistency based on how much water you add, which is excellent for making peanut sauces vs peanut butter to spread on apple slices etc.  I use this powdered peanut butter for smoothies, sauces, sandwiches, and even eating it straight with a spoon.  It is more salty than I prefer, but I think most people would like that level of saltiness.  My only real complaint is that it is super expensive.  If you're using it to spread on sandwiches, it'll only last like 6 sandwiches!  That being said, I still am glad that I buy and use it.

review/summary: Good PB
review/text: I've been using the PB2 in my protein shakes and I've been quite pleased. When mixed in, the flavor profile is different than traditional PB such as Skippy or JIF, but still tastes like a quality, full flavored peanut butter. The flavor is potent, and one half serving is usually sufficient to flavor a smoothie made with 1.5cups milk/banana/whey. It mixes well and produces a consistency similar to that of regular peanut butter. At 45calories I've found it an excellent replacement.

review/summary: It's surprisingly good!
review/text: I was actually a little surprised that this was as good as it was, because I've tried some of the other lower calorie peanut butters, like Better N Butter (I think that's what it was called) and I actually spit it out because it tasted so artificial. If you go to the Bell Plantation site, the company that makes this stuff, there are lots of recipes that look appetizing. My only problem with this powdered peanut butter is that it's just not as satisfying as the real stuff because there's no (or not much) fat in it . So sometimes it's hard to only eat a little like you would with normal peanut butter. But the taste is very natural, not fake tasting in any way, and I loved it!

review/text: If you are like me peanut butter is your crack! However, at 200 calories a serving it is a large dietary investment. But with PB2 all worries are put to rest. With only 45 calories per equivalent serving you can't get better than that. I love this product. It tastes and has the same consistency as normal peanut butter when mixed with water. Take my review along with all the other reviews and TRY IT.

review/summary: Good..but price is AWFUL
review/text: It's a relatively smaller jar that you get..about comparable to the smaller jars of PB you buy at a grocery store.  I love peanut butter but had cut it out of my diet because of the fat.  This was good when mixed with jelly, jam or honey..you can eat it just like that or spread it on bread/toast.  Yucky when mixed with water to dip fruit...wasn't salty enough and had a funny texture/taste.  Haven't tried it in cooking yet.<br /><br />ON BACK OF JAR ~ 2 Tb serving:  1.5g fat, 94 mg sodium, 5g carb, 2g fiber, 5g protein.  Ingred: roasted peanuts (defatted and powdrd), sugar and salt.<br /><br />Apparently there are other local places where you can get it much more cheaply and without the shipping.  Way too expensive for one jar and the exhorbitant shipping charges.

review/text: I have been using Bell Plantation for 3 years and think it is a God send. It works perfectly into the Weight Watchers program giving you all the taste of peanut butter without the caloric cost. Because it is powdered you have the option of making your peanut butter thick or thin. I think Bell's has a great peanut butter taste and I feel good about leaving out all of that artery clogging oil. My three children like Bell's 10years old, 13 years old and 15 years old. I feel good about giving them a healthy alternative. Love it, love it, love it!

It is superior.  I have it on apples or cabbage.  I don't overeat it because you have to mix it up - takes seconds - with water.  I have even used it in recipes that call for 1/4 cup PB.  It works fine.<br />Just remember, it is not PB.  If you are a die-hard PB Connoisseur, this may not be for you but if you love PB but want something with less calories and fat, PB2 is for you!

review/summary: Good for mixing, but use as supplement to real PB in sandwiches.
review/text: This stuff is really good added to oatmeal or greek yogurt.  As for a PB sandwich?  Not as sure.  I've mixed it with jelly, and it's pretty good, but I missed the texture contrast that you get with real PB.  I mitigate this by adding a very thin layer (I have a problem with putting WAY too much PB on) of real PB to my bread and then supplementing with the powdered stuff.  It works better that way, I think, and I don't get all the calories from using all regular PB.  I probably wouldn't buy this from amazon again because of the price, but I'm glad I tried it, and if it's on sale at whole foods or something I'd buy it.<br /><br />Oh, be careful when you're opening the jar for the first time...no sudden movements or you'll be covered in PB powder, and at this price, every grain is precious!

review/summary: Good, but expensive!
review/text: This powdered peanut butter is quite tasty, either on its own or mixed with water as instructed. The problem is, it is about twice as expensive as normal peanut butter wherever you try and find it. I didn't like the price on Amazon, and Bell Plantation's website charges over $11 to ship their 4 pack, which makes the price of each bottle about $7. $7 is also about the price I've seen in specialty stores as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while it is a healthy, tasty substitute for real peanut butter, I'll be sticking to the real thing due to the price. Plus, nut fats are good for you as long as they're consumed in moderation.

review/summary: Good but not great.
review/text: This review is primarily for the PB2 product (not the chocolate). As an avid PB fan, I wanted to try these, for the obvious caloric advantage over any other PB on the market. The PB2 has a definite "natural" PB-product flavor, and can be mixed to lend a similar consistency to peanut butter. That being said, I found it is not as fulfilling when snacked on alone, with a spoon. That being said, I imagine it would make an amazing replacement for real PB in any cooking recipe or blending protein shake. I did enjoy the chocolate flavored PB2 on its own, and would definitely buy it to snack on by itself again. :)

review/text: This is a tricky product to review.  On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter).  If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars.  However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).  But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor.  So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes.

review/text: I first purchased PB2 in Manhattan and was so excited about its great taste that I bought another four jars and mixed spoonfuls for colleagues at work. You can use PB2 as others have suggested, but I like it on sandwiches. My entire life I've been addicted to peanut butter, so much so that during college I ate 4 lbs of freshly ground health store peanut butter per week! I find that when I mix 2 TBSP of PB2 powder with jelly and put it on a sandwich it tastes as good as any peanut butter sandwich I've ever had.<br /><br />At 55, I'm blessed to be in great shape and have tried to stop eating peanut butter all together but it's impossible. So I'm here to order four more jars of what I consider to be a miracle: PB2!  Mix it with jelly (even margarine or a little butter) and enjoy an extremely low fat, old fashioned peanut butter sandwich.

review/summary: Excellent, except for Amazon's pricing mistake.
review/text: Excellent, mixes well in a protein shake and tastes just like a jar of peanut butter!<br />The only problem with ordering it from Amazon is they have an obvious pricing mistake, I can get this from other websites for $3.99 a jar, even if your an amazon prime member and get free shipping here, you will still save a lot ordering it elsewhere.<br />You can even get it from the manufactures website for much cheaper.<br />I called the company and the suggested retail price is approx. $4.00 per jar.

review/summary: Issue with Amazon and Price
review/text: This is a great product; tastes great, much healthier than regular commercial peanut butter.  Unfortunately, it is also available everywhere else on the internet for $3.99 while it's nearly $12 on Amazon.  I notified Amazon of this 300% difference in price nearly two months ago and they assured me they would look into it.  No adjustment to the price has been made and I would assume at this point, that it won't be.<br /><br />Buy the product but buy it anywhere else.

review/summary: Peanut Butter Flavor without the Peanut Butter Guilt
review/text: I love high-octane peanut butter, but not the fat/calorie content.<br /><br />TASTE: If you are accustomed to low-salt or raw products, the taste will be fine. If someone in the house balks at the taste, you can toss in a dash of fine sea salt or honey (agave works well too). You could easily mix PB2 with PB to wean onto this gradually.<br /><br />TEXTURE: Mixes fast and is very smooth (surprisingly). From the jar, it's similar in consistency to powdered sugar. Open factory seal on jar carefully so it doesn't fly out (trust me).<br /><br />MIXING: Easily mixes using a small spoon or spatula in a gently sloping small bowl (I use a pinch bowl)<br /><br />USAGE: PB2 has recipes on their website (Bell Plantation) and they also sell a chocolate/pb product. I'm a fan of straight PB2 (a spoon by itself) but have had PB2 on crackers, sprinkled on banana/apple slices, and am looking forward to making homemade PB2 ice cream this summer.<br /><br />STORAGE: I was a bit disappointed at shelf life projection.  As a dry product, it should last for years but the company says 10-12 months unopened and 4-6 opened. I would prefer to buy the larger sizes or a case to save more.<br /><br />COST: It can be obtained cheaper elsewhere (like on the PB2 website) but I had free shipping purchases to offset the cost. I wanted to try just one jar before committing to a larger sized container from the company. If you purchase natural products, the price won't be such a shock.<br /><br />BIGGEST PROS: lower calorie and fat content - hands down the best. Dogs like it too ;)<br />BIGGEST CONS: high cost and not a product you can 'make ahead' very successfully (though this could be considered a "PRO" because it helps with portion control. I make it as needed.<br /><br />This product will not change your life, but it will satisfy your peanut butter cravings.

review/summary: Really Good
review/text: This product is very good. I follow the directions exactly and mix it with water.. I havent tried mixing it w/ jelly or honey or anything else, as some others have suggested; the whole reason I bought this was because I wanted a lower calorie, lower fat alternative to regular peanut butter, so for me, mixing it with 150 calories worth of jelly doesnt make any sense.<br /><br />In any case, this is definitely NOT exactly like regular peanut butter.. the consistency is a little different, but I suppose you could adjust that to your own liking by adding more or less water. Also, you can definitely tell that this is a lower fat product than regular peanut butter; I mean, when you take a tablespoon of regular peanut butter, you can instantly taste and sense the richness due to the fat content, and when you eat PB2, you definitely notice the difference. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, just different. Its almost the same as if you are used to eating super premium, high fat ice cream, and then one day you switch to low fat; the low fat may still taste very good, but because you are so used to eating the high fat stuff, you will instantly notice a difference-- however, once you get used to it, it wont bother you.<br /><br />I would say PB2 is the same... its definitely NOT the exact same taste / texture as regular peanut butter, but its still very good. it has a very fresh, "clean" taste. in my opinion, its DEFINITELY worth the compromise, considering the huge amount of fat and calories in regular peanut butter, and how much healthier PB2 is in comparison . I have cravings for peanut butter just about every day, but up to now, I have only allowed myself to eat regular peanut butter about once a week, due to the fat and calorie content...  but now, since finding PB2, I allow myself to have it whenever I want it.<br /><br />By the way.. I tried the PB2 Chocolate version-- I ordered a sample from their website-- it was OK.. not fabulous, not bad. to me, if I am going to really "go for it" and eat chocolate peanut butter anything, its not going to be a low fat version, because its just not worth it. in other words, if I had a craving for a Reeses peanut butter cup, chocolate PB2 would not satisfy that craving. On the other hand, when I have craving for regular peanut butter-- in a sandwich or right off of a spoon, regular PB2 will satisfy that craving without wrecking my diet. Bottom line: if you arent sure whether or not you will like this product, go to the Bell Plantation website and spend the four bucks and order a sample, and give it a try, then you will know for sure before you commit to buying 4 jars plus shipping. ( and folks, the shipping costs almost as much as the 4 jars, so make sure you like this before you order it! )<br /><br />My final verdict is I am pretty sure I will be replacing regular peanut butter with PB2 for as long as they keep making it, and will probably order it by the case in the future to save on shipping.

review/summary: Decent taste, great health
review/text: Doesn't taste as good as real peanut butter of course, BUT the small amount of flavor lost is worth the trade off considering how much healthier it is.  The texture/consistency is also pretty much the same as normal PB once mixed.  If you just care about calories/fat and not so much about sodium, adding salt makes it taste a lot better.

Not powdery or chalky tasting, yummy enough to eat right out of the jar. . . almost.<br /><br />I looked at the website for other ways to use it and found more recipes than I expected and they cover all meals and types of foods.

review/summary: Your peanut fix
review/text: I first discovered this product through a discussion on Facebook and tried it blind based on this. Per the item description, this is powdered peanut butter... not just powdered peanuts. Like peanut butter, this also has salt and sugar, but is missing the oil. The strong peanut buttery flavor this provides is spot on and like other reviewers have said, is great to mix into other foods. I've tried to reconstitute it in order to spread on toast. You can do this but it's more trouble than it's worth impo.  This would probably be great in cookie recipes as the lack of oil wouldn't interfere with the consistency of the batter.<br /><br />Overall this is a great product that delivers as promised.<br /><br />>>P.S - Resist the urge to eat a spoonful of this stuff plain. You *will* choke...  so I hear ;-)  &lt;&lt;

review/summary: No basic directions
review/text: I made a peanut sauce with this and it was very good though not as smooth as with real PB. My beef with it is the lack of basic instructions on how much powder and water to use to make basic peanut butter.- there are recipes other website but not specific guidance on the mix you would use if just substituting peanut butter. Am I an idiot? Maybe... Still, if you need 2Tbs of peanut butter you will use almost 4 Tbs. I have only used it once so did not get good measurements because there was lots of adding more water or powder and also I usually weigh ingredients and as another reviewer pointed out the weight and volume on the label didn't match. This of course affects the calories and if you are counting them this matters to you.<br />I read reviews about price and didn't think much of it- it didn't seem that bad for a jar of PB but in a recipe that used 1/2c of PB I used at least 1/3rd of the jar so yeah, kinda pricey... It is what it is and I won't knock a star off but just keep in mind that this does not make a jar of PB which should have been obvious but then maybe I'm an idiot!

I was expecting bland, chalky paste but it definitely is nothing like that. MMM! So good! Excited to try it in/on everything!! If you're on the fence, just give it a try. For way under $10, and way under the regular fat content of regular peanut butter, this stuff is a god-send!

review/text: Wow! i was pretty surprised at how well this actually turned out! i had my doubts about the texture mostly, but combining with water really works! i also tried with milk and cream(kinda defeats the purpose XD), and it only does a little for texture and taste. I wouldnt compare the taste to that of natural or organic PB though, as it tastes more like Skippy, Peter Pan, and Jiffy. My favorite is combining 2Tbsp PB2 with 1Tbsp of regular, but im so happy that i can finally snack on  peanut butter without worrying about the calories! Also doesnt sit in your stomach like regular peanut butter can. Over a great product and i will continue to get it!

So when I found powdered peanut butter (with more than half the fat removed, but with the same peanutty taste), I was in heaven.<br /><br />Now I can mix it with my yogurt and/or ice cream; make my peanut butter pie and don't feel quite as guilty while totally enjoying the flavor.<br /><br />And ... so does my daughter-in-law who is a big fan of peanut butter also.<br /><br />So for all those peanut butter lovers out there, I highly recommend the Powdered Peanut Butter!!!

review/summary: PB2 Is A Dream Come True!
review/text: After reading the wonderful reviews of PB2, I was still skeptical but every rave review was right on the money!!<br /><br />The reduction in fat and calories is a gift from the peanut butter gods.  The fact that you mix it up as you go (which takes, literally, no more than 15 seconds) is a great help for people like me who sometimes like to settle down with a jar of peanut butter and a spoon, only to realize a zillion calories later what I have done.  You can control the texture by adding or subtracting the water recommended.  There's plenty of peanut flavor and they've added a bit of sugar (I assume to offset the lack of fat) but it is a very small amount and still adds far less in calories than all that subtracted fat and oil.<br /><br />The chocolate PB2 is also completely awesome.  I eat it straight and it's almost like chocolate mousse.  Sometimes I pop in a little regular PB2 if I'm not wanting it so sweet but any way you mix it, it rocks.<br /><br />I ordered and received $100.00 worth and I love the comfort of knowing my PB2 is there for the forseeable future.<br /><br />I hope that the word gets out to all the people who will love this product.<br /><br />Give it a try, you won't be sorry!

review/text: I was skeptical about this peanut butter product at first, but when I tried it I was pleasantly surprised!  The ingredients: peanuts, salt and sugar.  Doesn't get more pure than that!  I'm on the old Weight Watcher's Points plan and this PB2 is 1 point for two tablespoons! As a comparison, two tablespoons of "regular" store bought peanut butter is 5 points. The taste difference between this peanut butter and store bought peanut butter is so slight that it's not worth the extra calories to buy the "ready to eat" peanut butter.<br /><br />This product comes in a dry form. You add two tablespoons of the dry mix to one tablespoon of water, stir, and you have delicious peanut butter!!  It can be added to smoothies, to!!!  I would definitely get this product. I also bought the chocolate kind, but have yet to try it.

I've been telling everyone about it.  It's got a great flavor, and then when you consider that it's got 85% less fat, it's got AMAZING flavor!  Really!  I don't think you would be able to tell the difference on a sandwich.  I'm a by the spoonful kind of girl and the PB2 is totally satisfying.  Give it a shot.  I don't think you'll be sorry!

review/text: I have read other reviews on here, and thought I would throw in my thoughts.  I have been eating PB2 for a couple of years now.  What I have read from other users is that 2 tbsp of powder shrinks down to 2 tsp when mixed.  I have NEVER had this happen.  I mix 2 tbsp with 1 (plus a little extra) water and have a large amount (I'm talking 2 full tbsp) of "peanut butter" for my sandwich.  I would never put as much real peanut butter on a sandwich as I do this.  So, I don't know if I am doing it wrong, but I find this product to be great for sandwiches, especially if you are watching calorie intake.<br />The price is a little high, but I find it to be worth it.

review/text: As a regular all natural peanut butter eater, this product intrigued me with its low calories, and much lower fat. While the fat in natural peanut butter is the good kind (mono and poly) its nice to have a peanut butter that you can eat in larger quantities if desired without adding 40 grams of fat to your daily intake. I love th&eacute; cooking possibilities with this powder. It really tastes almost as good as other peanut butter... There's a slight difference I just can't put my finger on. But I enjoy it and recommend it.

I use it yogurt parfaits, on fruit, in smoothies.<br /><br />And I love that it's lower in fat and sugar than traditional peanut butter. So glad I found this, don't think I'll ever go back to the other stuff.

review/text: I've been buying this product for the last 4 years and have never waned in my love for it. Not only is it much more convenient than jarred peanut butter (MUCH easier to spread/prepare and bake with especially) but it also tastes better to me; much more "peanut" flavor, not too sweet but always sweet enough, and with the option of sweetening it extra if you like. Plus you can't beat the nutritional stats on this baby. I'll never go back to regular peanut butter again!

review/text: I am a peanut butter fanatic, but it was hard to eat a lot of it & stay within my calorie limits for the day. I was looking for a substitute that wasn't going to taste nasty and leave a weird aftertaste & I cam across PB2! I love the simple peanuty taste & it goes great in smoothies & in yogurt as well. Love this on a piece of whole wheat toast!

review/text: I've recently changed a lot of my eating habits in order to lose weight and cutting calories was key in my plans. PB2 was recommended to me by a friend who knew how much I loved peanut butter but had been abstaining from it due to the high calorie count. While PB2 is not exactly like normal peanut butter the taste and texture are very close and similar enough not to bother me. The product mixes together very well and the calorie deficit when compared to normal peanut butter makes this a no-brainer. Give it a try!

review/summary: I can have peanut butter again!
review/text: This stuff sounded too good to be true, but I tried it anyhow, and WOW am I glad that I did! I usually eat PB2 as a snack spread on a chocolate Vitatop muffin. I mix 1 tablespoon (22 calories!) with just enough water to make a good spreadable consistency, and then spread it on the muffin top. So yummy! I'm not sure why there are 10 or so one-star reviews... I guess if you are looking for the creaminess of peanut butter, then you won't like this because it doesn't have any oil in it. It's also more like natural peanut butter and not like Jif or Peter Pan, which have lots of added sugar. The powder also tends to repel liquids, so you have to treat it a bit like flour if you want to mix it into something else. Start by mixing a small amount of water with the powder until it loses the powdery texture, then add the peanut powder/water mixture to your recipe.

review/summary: Pretty tasty and very handy for the health conscious
review/text: Dont go into this thinking after you mix up your peanut butter that it will taste like what you are familiar with. It wont. This isnt laden with the sugars and oils that give most store brand peanut butters the flavor people are familiar with. In fact, most of the oil from the peanut is pressed out of this as well. This is just straight up peanut butter without any frills (well, it is after you mix water into it anyway). Personally, I like it, and besides, there is plenty sugar in jelly anyway if you are gonna eat a PB&J using this, which I do from time to time. For me, it's primary use is in smoothies though. This powder is perfect for that. It blends thoroughly and you dont get all that aforementioned sugar and oil (and usually transfats) that comes with using most normal peanut butters, which basically means you arent adding junk to your diet. I would recommend however that if you planning to use this exclusively for sandwiches and are concerned about the lack of sweetness, that you try a brand like Justin's instead. For me though, this is pretty much perfect.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellant Replacement to Peanut Butter
review/text: I tried this PB2 after reading about it in the Hungry Girl Cookbook. I was amazed at how wonderful it was. You can tell that there is no oil in the product so it is a little less creamy than real peanut butter. I LOVE peanut butter, but was doing weight watchers and couldnt justify using my points for real peanut butter. With PB2 I could eat peanut butter all the time and not feel guilty! It gets a little creamier when used with warm toast or on an English Muffin.<br /><br />I brough PB2 to work one day and introduced it to my co-workers. They asked to buy the jar I had left! They then ordered SIX jars for themselves. If you dont mind the calories, you might want to stick to regular peanut butter. But if you want an alternative that tastes just like peanut butter without the oil... this is EXCELLANT. I now actually prefer this to real peanut butter!!

I ate it smeared over two Corn Thin cakes, with 1/2 tbsp of reduced sugar jam and it was really satisfying, all for 104 calories! I probably won't eat this by the spoonful, like I love to do with peanut butter, but it will be great in sandwiches or with apples as a healthy snack.  I am very satisfied with the taste and texture of this peanut butter.  Yay!

It tastes exactly like peanut butter. IT lives up to all the reviews.  If they have it in a bigger size I will be ordering it or maybe in multiple jars. I mixed it and put in the Arctic Zero Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor and I swear I almost cried, it was so good.  It was like omg.

review/text: I was surprised at the taste of this powdered peanut butter.  It is very creamy and it you weren't told that it was powder mixed with water, you couldn't tell the difference.  The only draw back is that you have to eat it after its mixed.  I tried to make a little extra for later and the consistency changed.  Just prepare the amount you plan on consuming and it is very good.

review/summary: Fantastic for Protein Shakes!
review/text: I drink a lot of protein shakes and am always looking for healthy ways to change them up. This Peanut Butter powder is perfect.  Carries exactly the same flavor as regular PB, but with only 45 calories and 1.5g fat per 2 Tbsp serving.  Seems to equal out in measurement to real PB in terms of flavor(2 Tbsp reg PB = 2 Tbsp PB2).  Haven't tried it straight yet as the product suggests.  BONUS - Received this the day after I ordered it - love Amazon Prime!
