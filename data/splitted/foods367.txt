review/summary: The best store bought tortilla chips!
review/text: I love salsa and chips.  Throughout the years I've tried many brands of chips.  Rarely, however, I have returned to one particular brand.  That was until I happened upon the On the Border chips at my local Kroger.  Wow.  Go find some of these chips now.  They taste freshly made (especially when warmed) and are sure to make your favorite salsa taste extra special.<br /><br />I like to get salsa to go from a local Mexican restaurant.  I had struggled to find a chip that was "worthy" of the restaurant's salsa.  As noted previously, I've sampled many varieties of chips.  Many were good but none great.  These chips are just as good as the made-from-scratch ones that my favorite Mexican restaurant gives to customers. I love placing some of these chips in the oven for a couple of minutes; they taste even more authentic when warmed.  Best of all, they are the perfect complement to the salsa made by my local restaurant.<br /><br />The chips are labeled as low in sodium and have about 80 mg of salt per serving.  Despite the lower sodium content, I did not find myself pouring salt on them.  I found them to have a very nice salty component.<br /><br />The only issue I have had with these chips is the excessive number of crushed chips about 2/3 - 3/4 through the bag.  Many bags of chips have those small pieces that are nearly worthless for dipping.  The five to six bags I have purchased over the last couple of months from different Kroger stores have had this issue.  It is like someone smashed the bag 2/3 of the way down into tiny bits but left the chips in the upper portion of the bag alone.<br /><br />I purchase these chips from my local Kroger for about 3 dollars a bag.

review/text: I used to buy Stella D'Oro  Anisette and Almond Toast to eat for breakfast all the time,  but have found them to be stale and hard as rocks since corporate greed shut down the ages old Bronx factory.  Quality and care are gone from the Stella D'Oro brand and I will no longer be buying their products.  If you think I'm kidding, try squeezing one of the cookies through the cellophane/plastic bag and you will feel a rock hard, rather than spongy texture, regardless of the date stamped.

review/summary: Stella Doro - a wonderful food destroyed by greed
review/text: The Stella Doro company was sold and they are now baking in the south.  I believe North Carolina.  Although the recipes may be the same, the machines used are not the same and they use high-speed cake mixers which destroy the texture of the dough. I called the company after purchasing Anisette Biscuits which were awful and had a sandy texture rather than spongy.  The company apologized and sent me coupons saying they were trying to get the process correct.  I again purchased the biscuits and, just like my first purchase, I threw them away.  Sad to lose such a wonderful product over cheap labor, bad baking and bad business practices.

review/text: As others have said, they no longer are spongy, but have been stale and hard for a few months now. But now, to add insult to injury, they have decreased the size of the cookies, making them even easier to become "hard" or stale. Well... nothing lasts forever, I guess even a proven cookie that has sold well. I'm done with Stella Doro Anisette Toast. I'd rather have fond memories than rock hard dunkers.

review/summary: The best taste and quality....
review/text: This brand may be a little more expensive but I feel it is well worth it. For one thing we did a blind taste test with several major brands just out of curiosity one day and all picked this one as the best tasting. Most major brands taste like flavored water in my opinion. This actually tastes like beef. I noticed that Amazon does not list the ingredients so i went to Imagine's web site to see for myself. I copied and pasted them here. Thought this might be helpful. I care a lot about ingredients which is the second reason I purchase this brand. P.S. The chicken broth is also very good.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />organic beef broth (filtered water, organic beef), organic onions, organic celery, sea salt, organic beef flavor, organic beef extract, organic carrots, organic garlic, organic spice.

review/summary: Tea from seller TeaCakeCoffee is NOT advertised product
review/text: In case you didn't know, this tea has been discontinued and the only boxes available for purchase are old stock, many of which are from who-knows-where and are who-knows-how-old, as I found out the hard way:<br /><br />I ordered this product from a seller named TeaCakeCoffee, whose profile says they ship out of Texas.  Unfortunately for me, it turned out that they ship from China.  The tea's box design looked different from that shown in this photo and from what I used to buy all the time from the grocery store, but I figured maybe I was sent the European version.  Despite the tea's Taiwanese postmark, I somehow got up the nerve to try one cup of it.  I don't know what the heck is in this "tea", but it sure ain't Twinings.  It didn't smell or taste whatsoever of vanilla, and the tea tasted completely, absolutely weird.  I threw the box out and thanked my lucky stars I didn't end up with a stomachache.<br /><br />Purchasing this discontinued tea is not recommended, unless you manage to find a stray box on your local grocery store's shelf.  As for buying from TeaCakeCoffee, that's the last time I'll make that mistake.

review/summary: Grandmothers Jelly
review/text: As a child I loved to go to my grandmothers house and see what was on her table.  Being from England, she always had something interesting. But, her favorite and mine was her "mint jelly". She always made her own, and we ate it on toasted English Muffins. The muffins would always be crunchy and the mint jelly always seemed to wake you up, perk you up, for whatever she had planed to do that day. I've searched for "mint jelly" for some time before I realized that is was pretty rare in today's stores.  But, when I came across the "Maple Grove Jelly," made with real mint. Well, I must admit, I bought a whole carton.  My husband thought I was nuts, but, now he's tried it, and every other day, I have to put a new jar out.

review/text: Although this cocoa is called Special Dark, it isn't the same Special Dark cocoa of a few years ago.  The previous Special Dark was 100% Dutched Cocoa, while the current Special Dark is a blend of Dutched and Natural Cocoas, so it isn't as dark or as strong as the previous one.  It is very good and has a pleasant fruity taste as compared to the more bitter and richer cocoa taste of its predecessor.  Initially I preferred the previous Special Dark, but am getting used to the new blend. The price is very good.

review/summary: WOW!!!
review/text: I was between the Girardelli (I don't know if that's how you spell it) and this Hershey's Cocoa Special Dark.  I had tried Girardelli's powdered cocoa before and remember the first time I tried it as hot chocolate I thought to myself it's ok but nothing amazing so this time I bought the Hersheys.  The first thing I noticed is the almost black-gray color when you mix it into the hot milk with barely a trace of brown.  That didn't seem too appetizing but I prefer it to having artificial colors added.  From the first sip the taste was amazing!  One of those situations where you just can't put the cup down and keep taking small sips even though this liquid was steaming hot.  I made it with powdered milk (0 fat) raw sugar, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.  The dark chocolate taste is amazingly full and satisfying.  When I started to drink this I thought I might get a stomach-ache since it looked so dark but not at all (Used a very heaping teaspoon)

review/text: I've been drinking this for several years and just looked on Amazon because lately it's not available in any of my supermarkets.  It's value is that it is half natural cocoa which is extremely high in antioxidents and half dutch processed which dissolves and blends well.  I can just stir in a teaspoon full into plain hot water for a healthy, delicious bitter cocoa drink. Way better than coffee.<br /><br />The only things that could make it any better is being organic and from fair trade sources.

review/text: I ordered this bulk package because I needed A LOT of cocoa powder to make hot cocoa mix gift sets for Christmas.  The cocoa was fresh and worked exceptionally well for cocoa mix.  I did not bake with it, so I have no idea how this cocoa will perform in baked goods.  The description doesn't say dutch process cocoa (that I noticed), but it is.  The price when I ordered came to 2.72/unit, which was a bargain compared to store prices.  I tend to choose Hershey over other brands when I have the choice so I don't have a lot to compare to, but this does live up to the quality chocolate taste I expect from Hershey.  I would definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Excellent flavorful cocoa powder
review/text: I'd never used this before, or heard of it, so compared to regular Hershey's cocoa (which I managed to run out of) this had a noticeably stronger and better chocolate flavor to it when I made a "Hershey's Collector's Cocoa Cake" recipe from a Hershey's cocoa package around 1988. I've made that recipe dozens of times. This time I tried some and was surprised at how good it tasted, and I'd been buying Penzey's cocoa for several years. I liked this product just fine, no complaints at all!<br />---<br />We made the chocolate mousse recipe printed on the back of the container and it turned out GREAT. It's basically cream and gelatin with cocoa and sugar. Totally easy and more importantly COOL to prepare in the summer months. Serve it in wine glasses and it looks really fancy. The cocoa, again, carried the day. Deep, intense chocolate flavor. Pleased but puzzled to find a top-quality chocolate product from Hershey's, for some reason. Exceeds my expectations by a noticeable measure.

review/summary: Low Calorie Chocolate--great with stevia!
review/text: If you love chocolate and want to eat more dark chocolate as nutritionists recommend, but are limiting calories, this special dark chocolate is delicious.  For about 10 calories a tablespoon, you can make tasty cocoa or I like to put it in iced coffee for a mocha iced coffee with a bit of sweetener.  A nutritionist recommended stevia as a natural sweetener which is calorie free and sweeter than sugar.  Just heat up some milk, add the cocoa and stevia and for about 110 calories, you have a great drink.

review/text: Our local supermarkets do not carry the Hershey's Dark, so I priced out the Hershey's Dark on the internet. Amazon has the best price for a pack of 6 cans. This will last a while.  We love the dark cocoa--it gives your cocoa or whatever baking items an extra bit of flavor. Plus the dark chocolate is good for you, right?  This purchase averaged out to about $3.75 per can, which is a great deal, considering our supermarket charges over $5.00 per can for the regular cocoa. Can't go wrong here!

review/text: If you're a real chocoholic, you need to have this cocoa on hand.  You can buy it anywhere but I found that Amazon had the best price.  I shared a few with family and friends and kept a couple for me.  This is NOT the same as their Dutch process.  I wish they'd bring that back!!  This is dark baking cocoa.  But with the right recipes, you can do a lot with it.

review/summary: Not so special
review/text: If you know what real Dutch processed cocoa is, you probably won't like this.  This may use a traditional method somewhere in its production, but it is nothing like the reddish-brown loveliness you get with the 'real' alkaline-process cocoas.<br /><br />DO NOT get this thinking it's the genuine article.  If you want strong flavor, this will certainly do, but if you care about true chocolate flavor, avoid this like the plague.<br /><br />Hershey's used to make an authentic Dutch processed cocoa I can't find any more - it had a silver label.  If they still sell it, get that instead - it's very good and as reasonably priced as their other cocoa products.<br /><br />As far as flavor goes, I put this well below their normal powdered cocoa.

This  product is a blend of natural and Dutch process cocoas.  The description is misleading.  I have written a letter to Customer Service about this, but my hopes for a good result are not high.  Apparently because this a food item, even though none of the cans was opened, it is not a returnable item.  I'm not a happy camper!

Nutricity said I did in fact receive what I ordered because the UPC on the jar of sauce matched the UPC on the item listed. I informed them and even took pictures of the items description, the picture shown for the advertisement, and the confirmation email showing them that NO WHERE does it say plum. Even the colors of the labels were different. Still, all they did was refund me. Which was fine. I just don't want anyone else making the same mistakes thinking they are buying the sauce shown.

All the extra trimmings were included with the roses along with a very nice vase. See additional pics - hopefully the pics aren't as distorted as the preview pictures.<br />The florist farmer shipped same day and the flowers arrived the next day by 2:30 pm - not a week later as indicated at checkout. I paid the standard shipping price as well - not expedited. The seller might want to consider changing the shipment policy to increase business. What is posted at checkout made me wonder how the flowers would look after sitting in trucks for a week.<br />If you want to impress - this seller has got the magic touch.

review/summary: Not very lemon-y
review/text: This oil tastes like regular olive oil, with maybe a hint of lemon. I have had very good lemon olive oils, and this doesn't come close.  It doesn't taste bad - just not lemon-y. But I guess I can't expect too much for the price. Usually a good lemon oil will be at least twice the cost.

review/summary: Sweet and low
review/text: I use this product with unsweetened Mango Koolaid for extremely low calorie drink.  Just Like Sugar has fewer calories than Xylitol and is diabetic & low carb friendly.  Great for weight conscious, too.  It is somewhat less sweet than sugar so either add more or combine with stevia and/or lo han guo to save a bit on cost.  I use them all along with xylitol.  Makes a great low calorie beverage.

review/summary: Best I have tried
review/text: This is the best sugar substitute I have tried! Everyone (including a certain celebrity Dr.) raves about Stevia...it makes me nauseated. I heard a lot of great things about Erythritol...it great to sweeten iced tea....it has a cooling minty taste which is gross in baking. So I tried Just Like Sugar...I made a batch of peanut butter cookies...they were awesome! Not as sweet as real sugar but since I've eliminated sugar from my diet, food that I used to enjoy is almost sickening sweet to me, so it is not a problem. No off taste, no after taste and no stomach aches.  This helps soothe your digestive track...can stabilize blood sugar...and it tastes good...what more can you ask for. People are always going to complain that is doesn't taste exactly like sugar...well it's not sugar, so it's not going to taste EXACTLY like it, BUT it is clean tasting, not sickly sweet like Stevia and it makes you feel good! I wish it was less expensive but I don't use it everyday so it will last me! I love it!!!!

review/summary: Hands down the best coconut water!
review/text: I absolutely love this coconut water.  Amy & Brian's in general is better than any that I've tried.  To me, the other brands have a "chalky" mouthfeel after you swallow.  Amy & Brian's is very clean, and has a very light yellow tint, rather than a pink tint like the others I've tried.  The original is very good, but I love lime, so I thought I'd give this a try.  I'm hooked!  Like I said, it has a very "clean" taste, and the lime is definitely there, but it is not at all sour.  It really does kind of taste like a flat lemon-lime soda would taste, or lemon lime Gatorade, minus the salt.  I do not drink soda or any other sugary drinks, and haven't for 16 years, so I really am not accustomed to sweet beverages, but Amy & Brian's is definitely sweeter than others I've tried. It is also very replenishing.  I drink this when I exercise and also before and after I drink alcohol.  It is very good, I think you will love it!

review/text: I've been extremely impressed with Amy & Brian's coconut juices.  If you take a look at the ingredients, it's just young coconut juice and lime juice.  How could it be any purer than that?<br /><br />I thought this flavor tasted a little funny at first, but I think I didn't shake it.  After shaking it before subsequent experiences, it had a very refreshing lime taste along with the coconut juice.<br /><br />Amy & Brian coconut juices are fantastic energizers and a great pick-me-up during the day.

review/summary: like lemon-lime gatorade but better, and much better for you!
review/text: the first time i had coconut water (juice), i wasn't a fan - it isn't what you'd expect, if you expect ripe coconut flavor.  it is an acquired taste in my opinion.  that being said, i really love it now.  i drink at least one serving a day.  i was hesitant to try the lime flavor because i like the regular version so much.  i picked some up and it is a great twist on the original.  it reminds me of lemon-lime gatorade but without all the sugar.  i use this to give me an energy boost before a workout and ALWAYS have some after an intense session.  if you ever need to replenish your body after dehydrating for a weigh-in, replace your gatorade or pedialyte with this!  it is the most refreshing and replenishing beverage i've ever had.  try all varieties of this brand.  i've had zico (tetro and bottle), o.n.e., vita coco, and goya (don't do it) and A&B has the best flavor by far...most similar to what i got from a young thai coconut.

review/text: I used to really drink a lot of gatorade when I was younger, especially the lemon lime.  As time goes on we tend to get more wise with our food choices and I generally eat as natural as possible.  I've used to crack open young coconuts and this was pretty much my favorite beverages.  Now I'm in an area where young coconuts arent available and this product makes it so much easier to still enjoy them.  To me, the lime flavored one is the best and is very sports drink-like.  The one with the pulp is interesting too, I order that one sometimes but I drink this product over it usually.  This brand is one of the better coconut waters, used to get it from a health food store but these prices are much better it seems.

review/summary: Great distraction!
review/text: I found these to be quite expensive from Petsmart if I bought a few at a time, so I bought this box from Amazon.<br /><br />They arrived pretty fast and are a very good distraction for my 8 month old puppy. I put one every morning inside the Kong toy and he gnaws and gnaws on it the whole day. Of course he eats upto where he cannot get to it which is where the fun part starts - him trying to get to where he can eat it...it takes him quite a while so in a whole day he only has one treat.<br /><br />He is however growing and I may have to switch to the one level up Ziggies<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone especially if your pet needs distraction especially if you are away. But be sure to adjust his food to accomodate the treat so that you do not overfeed.

It needed to be stirred because the manna and oil separates (thats because it was warm) I hated the texture. It was so weird. SO I drink a chocolate protein smoothie every morning I make myself. I add a big tablespoon of this. It's wonderful. I have noticed a huge difference in my skin and my tongue. I know that sounds weird, my tongue. But its doing good things for my liver. I ran out of it and went a week without it, and the spots on my tongue came back, been on the coconut manna for 5 days now and they are gone again. I think it helps with my liver.

review/summary: Great snack for low-carbers and those with nut allergies
review/text: 1 tablespoon has 3 grams of carbs and 2 of fiber, 1 of protein, 9 of healthy coconut fat.<br /><br />It does taste sweet to somebody who has been low-carbing or avoiding processed sweeteners for a while.  Probably it will not seem that sweet if you eat a lot of sugars regularly.  It isn't a cloying, over-powering sweetness that comes with sugar laden, refined snacks.<br /><br />The texture of the manna all by itself is a bit pasty, like peanut-butter, only slightly more so. It can have the same stick to the roof of your mouth texture as peanut butter.  The oil will separate, and the way to stir it back in is to warm the entire jar so it's all very soft, and then stir back in.<br /><br />I think it's delicious.  I like a bit spread like butter (warm slightly to spread) on a flax seed cookie I make. Sometimes I mix it into the batter of the flax seed cookie.<br />I like a dab on a sweet potato chip.<br /> It's a good 'candy' if you mix warmed manna well with a bit of ground flax seed, a few drops of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00142FP5I">SweetLeaf Liquid Stevia, Chocolate 2 fl oz (60 ml)</a>, and cocoa powder- drop onto waxed paper, put in fridge for the manna to harden.

review/text: Imagine someone ground up a coconut and stuck it in a jar, and you've got coconut mana. It's lower in calories and fat than pure coconut oil, and is a fine accompaniment to any chocolate dish you care to create. I love the stuff.<br /><br />That said, unless you have a fresh jar the coconut meat and oil tend to separate. It's very difficult to recombine them, and they keep separating after you stir them. I recommend using an extra container to hold some of the mixture while you stir; otherwise it's easy to spill. I reduced my 5 star review down to 4 because of this issue.

review/summary: Manic for Manna!
review/text: My husband and I recently went "Primal" after seeing wonderful results from our daughter, who brought us a jar of Nutiva Coconut Manna yesterday.  I just had my first spoonful and it was love at first bite. I haven't had refined sugar, grains, or processed foods of any kind for 5-6 weeks now and this was a wonderful sweet treat that was almost decadent.  It was filling and satisfying and will certainly be included as permanent staple in our pantry going forward.  I'm wondering if the folks who felt that it wasn't sweet are eating sugar.  I feel that once you "detox" from refined sugars, your taste buds are heightened and you can truly appreciate this great product.

review/summary: The manna is quite good, but what a royal pain to use - if you live in cold weather areas, order this in summer
review/text: Does it taste good? Yes. If you like the taste and texture of coconut butter, you will most certainly like this product.<br /><br />Does it spread nicely? Well, that depends on where you live and how patient you are. In cold weather this is a royal pain to use because the oil separates and hardens at temperatures below 76 F. The instructions on the label say to place the container in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes to soften the manna. Well, in my kitchen (room temperature about 70 F) it took almost a half hour for this thing to melt.<br /><br />I placed the jar inside a stainless steel saucepan filled with hot water that must have been at least 180 F. After 5 minutes the water had cooled quite a bit and yet the oil had not even started to melt. I used a blunt knife to try and break the manna into pieces. Did the same thing two more times. Finally, the fourth water change did the trick and the manna now had acquired a nice consistency, perfect for spreading, but at that point I was not a very happy camper.<br /><br />I wanted to use this as a breakfast spread and that's not going to happen, at least not during the week. I just don't have the time nor the patience. It just takes too long.<br /><br />I buy natural organic peanut butter, which also must be mixed well for the oil to combine, but I only have to do that once so I don't mind at all. With this manna it's an everyday event.<br /><br />I ordered two jars, one of them will live in my pantry until next summer, and we'll treat coconut manna as a warm weather food, I guess.<br /><br />This is a very nice tasting coconut product, which I would have rated 5 stars otherwise. Certainly worth a try, if you happen to keep your house above 75 F year round.
