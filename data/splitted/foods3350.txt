review/summary: just the right mix
review/text: Kind fruit and nut bars are a great snack for between last break (1:30) and supper.I only eat half, it is high in calories.I eat it with some plain yogert for lunch to balance out the sweetness in the Kind bar. The price is better online then in stores, and alot better then a candy bar from the vending machine at work.

review/text: We purchased Kind Fruit & Nut, Apple Cinnamon & Pecan, Gluten Free Bars as a gift.  The gift was warmly received.  I was not offered a bar, so I do not know how they taste, but I'm guessing by their reaction they are pretty good.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: So, there must be some mommies out there like me who buy these bars for kids but won't eat them yourselves? You pop them in the lunch box together with the fruit in the bid to get them to stay off the junk food in school? Most of the time, these bars turn out to be a complete waste cos the kids will tell you that they are the worst thing ever. And you are wracked with guilt thinking you've scarred them for life. But then, you do it again anyway. And so, one day, I tried 1 of these bars and when I asked how it was - the answer surprised me. "They're delicious, Mom. Really yummy" I was stunned. A nut bar that passes the test. I'm so glad there's Amazon. I bought 2 packs - one fruit and nut and another variety pack. She loves all that she's tried so far.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I took a couple to the office. One day, in hunger, I finally opened one. And Oh. I. see. They're good. Really good. They're crunchy without being hard, a little sticky without being too sweet, a good mix of textures without them sticking to the space between your teeth. And at the end of the bar, you feel something in your tummy. Not full exactly but at least it does the job to stave off the hunger pangs.<br /><br />I'm now looking at other flavours to buy because this is going to be the Snack Of Choice 2012 for this household at least!

review/summary: Yum! And okay for my blood sugar
review/text: Out of all the energy bars on the market, this is the one that really keeps my blood sugar from skyrocketing. The mix of fruit and nuts really satisfies my hunger. The fruit and nut bar has 180 cal, healthy fat from the nuts, low in salt and a good source of fiber. Best of all its delicious and lacks that protein powder taste some of the other bars have.

review/text: I have enjoyed these KIND bars before.  I ordered this variety along with the Cherry dark chocolate Cashew.  The Cherry bars were very fresh, however, the Peanut Dark chocolate were extremely stale/hard.  I haven't had time to send them back and probably won't bother.  From now on, I will just buy them at my local Wegmans.  This was very dissapointing.

review/text: I received a box of Kind Fruit and Nut delight for Christmas.  I tried it for the first time and it was so good, such a delightful and fulfilling taste that is both good and good for me.  I like the fact that it is all natural, no funny taste and no yacky after taste.  You can actually taste the fruits in each bar. I have a sweet tooth and Kind bar satisfies my craving.  Try it and you will see what I mean.  I recommend this to anyone trying to eat sensibly and indulgent at the same time.

review/text: my husband and i are fans of the kind bars as a quick snack or the like. we know they can be a little more than other bars and maybe not as uber healthy as some would prefer BUT... these bars are wonderful! they are nutritious and delicious and filling. they don't taste like anything else out there either and i mean that in the best way. when i want a sweet treat i am more than satisfied with the apple cinnamon pecan (my new fave) or the dark chocolate sesame. better than reaching for an average, preservative & sugar loaded candy bar. way more satisfying in every way. i just ordered 2 more boxes of 2 different flavors. we can't wait to try them!

review/text: Finally, a nutritious snack that actually tastes good! I normally don't like apricots but this bar is not overpowered by the fruit.  It's the right combination of almond and apricot flavors so that it's not overly sweet or nutty.  I do wish it were a bit bigger in portion.  It doesn't feel like a meal replacement but definitely a good snack. Even if you're not a big apricot fan, I highly recommend giving this one a try.  The monthly delivery service also provides a nice little discount!

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: I am allergic to wheat and hypoglycemic, so finding a wheat free, low glycemic snack bar sounded too good to be true.  Happily, it wasn't!  Every Kind bar I have tried has been delicious, and it makes a good "on the go" snack to keep in my purse.  It's also great to pack when I travel, since it is really hard to avoid wheat when I am eating out, and due to the hypoglycemia I have to eat meals on a regular schedule. I love the fact that Kind bars are made from real ingredients - the list of ingredient is short and I can pronounce everything on the label because it's the type of stuff I have in my pantry.  I ordered one box to try them out, then a few more to keep on hand, and now I have just subscribed for monthly delivery.  I highly recommend these bars!!

I hesitated because let's admit, anything that comes in bar form and is good for you has GOT to taste terrible!  Well, now I know differently.  These are delicious!  My brother-in-law is diabetic and can eat these bars.  I find eating one between meals curbs my appetite.  They are crunchy, fruity and just plain delicious.  Haven't been able to find these in our area stores so I order Kind bars through Amazon and I'm pleased with how quickly and safely they arrive.  I recommend these to anyone who wants to find an enjoyable way to have a snack between meals and that's good for them, too.

review/text: These are really tasty, that's a fact.  Because they're made of fruit, nuts, and puffed rice, they're also reasonably healthy, making them a reliable snack.  I only wish these babies had a bit less sugar, therein allowing me to eat them more often than I currently allow myself to.  Of course, I'm sure that would mess up the flavor and make them an entirely different bar, so that's not really a possibility.)<br /><br />Overall, an excellent portable snack, with plenty of healthy fats and deliciousness.

review/summary: Satisfying & Delicious
review/text: These bars had a generous amount of nuts and the right balance of fruit without the overly sweet filling I dislike in other brands.  The result is a bar with enough protein to satisfy and just enough sweetness to give a little pep--a great bar for the grab-and-go breakfast with my coffee or for the 3 PM slump at work. The bars come in at 180 calories, which is just about right for a snack that also delivers protein, but maybe on the high end of snack portions for those watching calories. However, this is a nice sized bar; it doesn't feel like a tiny portion. This will become a regular addition to my pantry.

review/summary: Likely the best nut bar I've ever tasted
review/text: I had purchased these when they were about $15.50 for a box of 12 and although that is a bit pricey compared to a box of bars you can get from any other brand, it's much cheaper compared to the $3.29 that I had paid for just one bar at the airport and much better tasting than the rest of the nut bars produced by other companies out there!  Right before I was going on a transpacific flight, I wanted to get some snacks to hold me over so this was one of the items I bought at SFO.  As soon as I took the first bite, I remember thinking how good these were and knew that I had to buy these, once I got back to the states.  I ordered the Almond & Coconut ones and they are awesome!  One look at the ingredients and that tells you how there's nothing but all natural stuff in here and the taste is truly delicious!  Personally, I don't think there is a better tasting bar out there than this - it is so far THE best I've tried!

review/text: I purchased Almond/Apricot and Almond/Coconut and they are both delicious!<br /><br />These bars are made mostly out of almonds and other nuts, held together by sweet syrup (not too sweet).<br />Both have a hint of coconut flavor (Almond/Coconut has a slightly stronger coconut flavor). The apricot adds a bit of tang to the flavor, which I really enjoyed. I liked Almond/Apricot slightly better for this burst of tartness.<br /><br />Each bar is individually wrapped, long and slim, and easy to slip into a purse and bring along when you need a bit of pick-me-up on the go.<br /><br />I highly recommend these bars!<br /><br />I am attaching a photo with the wrapper off with one bite taken, so you can see the texture of the bar inside the wrapper.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: great gluten free snack
review/text: It's  a great gluten free snack to have with you when you don't know what's available for you in the "gluten free"  zone.  Some restaurants have gluten free food, some don't. At least you won't go hungry.  It's a delicious power bar snack.  Easy to have with you and much more affordable to buy online than in the store.

review/summary: Macadamia & Apricot - WOW!
review/text: I agree with the previous reviewer - these are very addictive!  I ordered the Macadamia & Apricot bars and they are simply wonderful.  The flavor is absolutely delightful.  The apricot flavor comes out first.  The macadamia nuts are evenly distributed so that you always get the nutty flavor along with the apricot flavor.  The third thing I got was the coconut (mmm, love coconut!).  When I ordered them I didn't realize they had coconut in them so I was very happy.  The coconut is not overdone either.  It's just enough to taste it along with everything else.  I am amazed at how they put these flavors together so wonderfully so that they all shine.<br /><br />I don't even like honey (can't stand it!) and even the honey flavor went superbly with the other flavors in this bar and was not at all overwhelming.  I caught the sweet undertones but most of the sweetness I tasted was from the apricots.<br /><br />I went on subscribe and save, then I went in and revised it to get MORE of them even more often!  BTW, the box I received had a 'use by' date of Oct 2013 on it, so they are very fresh.

review/text: This product tastes very good. The almond and coconut pairs well together. I can't find anything wrong with this product. It's not like the typical tasting fruit and nut bar, or a granola bar. Rather, it's in a field on its own. I appreciate how healthy it is for you (low calorie, low sugar, low sodium, gluten free, etc...) but you wouldn't know it by the flavor. I am certain you will like the taste of it.

review/text: As someone new to gluten-free living, I'm struggling to find "treat" options.  KIND bars go a long way towards filling that void!  The Apricot Almond is a little on the super-sweet side.  After trying the Mango Macadamia (AWESOME!) and Fruit & Nut w/ Yogurt (a pretty close second) I probably won't buy the Apricot Almond again.  But I won't have any trouble eating the ones I have, either.  :)

review/text: It seems the almond & apricot bars were changed when they switched from the 8 pack to the 12 pack so that they added more apricot or sweetness in some way.  I was happy with the less-sweet version, but the taste is still divine. The kids' favorite are the fruit & nut, but this is a close second.  The subscription price beats all the market prices I've seen.

review/summary: The Glucose In KIND Products Is Corn Syrup
review/text: I ate a KIND bar (Almond & Apricot) for the first time yesterday. Fabulous taste, crunchy, yet soft and chewy. One thing that concerned me was the ingredient "Glucose". That could mean so many things. So I contacted the company to see what their glucose is made from. It's corn syrup. This was their response:<br /><br />"Thank you again for contacting KIND Healthy Snacks.<br /><br />Please note that this ingredient is corn syrup, but is not to be confused with high fructose corn syrup.  I am pleased to inform you that we use only all-natural, non-GMO corn syrup, which when combined with honey, helps us achieve the best flavor while allowing our bars to remain crunchy.  Please also note that 13 out of our 15 snack bars are considered low GI foods, which includes the flavor you are referring to, our Fruit & Nut Delight bar.<br /><br />I hope you find this information helpful.  Please also feel free to contact me with any additional questions or comments, and I would be happy to help you.<br /><br />KIND Regards,<br /><br />(Name Removed)<br /><br />Customer Experience Manager<br />KIND Healthy Snacks<br />(212) 616 - 3006"<br /><br />Corn syrup, even if it's "non-GMO" and not high fructose, isn't healthy. One of my children gets very sick eating corn syrup, so unfortunately Kind products will be on our list of things that we never buy.<br /><br />Kind is being deceptive in not listing where their glucose comes from. They probably know that it wouldn't be well received if that ingredient were listed as corn syrup, not glucose, which it should be.

review/summary: Love these, but they keep shrinking
review/text: These are a staple on my grocery list from Amazon (I get two boxes a month on the "Subscribe and Save" program, and often have to "send next shipment now" because I share them with friends at work).  However, I've become alarmed when I open the newer boxes / packages- the bars are at least an inch shorter than they used to be.<br /><br />I thought maybe I had a few from the "end of the roll" or something, but it seems rather consistent now.  The cellophane wrapper is the same size, but the bars are missing at least a full bite of what the bars used to be.  And the prices keep going up.  I like these, but at some point the decreased "value" will get to a point where I'll find something else to snack on.

review/summary: AMAZING TASTE (I've had the almond apricot, fruit&nut, apple cinn pec, alm/cash/flax, etc).It's candy, dessert...
review/text: I would not use these as a meal replacement. Not enough protein, for one. But when I have them with a meal as dessert, no blood sugar spike. (I used to be prediabetic, and I do check these days to see how foods are affecting me.)<br /><br />But for folks who want a "less crap" candy bar or dessert treat, this one's it. VERY sweet. Tastes just like these chewy coconut candies my mom used to bring home in the 60s and 70s in my Bronx days. I used to love those. And I love the Almond Apricot for tasting like them. Every single variety I've tried--about a half dozen--are very good. But Almond Apricot is my fave. It hits the "oh, candy" and "ooh, nostalgia" vibe for me.<br /><br />My second fave (though it's gaining on the Almond Apricot in stealth mode) is the Almond Cashew Flax one. I thought I'd hate it (flax is not my fave thing), but man, it's like a gentle cookie taste in a chewy bar. It's quite delightful. I find I want to reach for that one for my evening "dessert" with coffee treat.<br /><br />Third fave: Mango Macadamia with Calcium. Very mangoey. Mangoes are my fave fruit and these do taste mango-ey. Macadamia is quiet enough in the taste department to let the fruit shine through. Different "bite" texture than the almond based ones, too. Smoother. (I'm a Caribbean born gal, and I've adored them since I was a wee one.)<br /><br />The peanutty ones are my least fave. I do find the cashew and almond based ones just are more enjoyable.<br /><br />If you low carb, you probably wanna steer towards, say, the Almond Coconut and have half (or one of the minis). It's not a lot of calories, and it's certainly a prettier nutritional profile for those who want a more "whole food"/no gluten lifestyle. (Beware the ones with peanuts if you're more into the Primal/Paleo side of things.)<br /><br />These babies are SWEET. If you're prone to abuse sweets like candy bars, don't even taste these. I'm serious. They're amazing. Addictive. Delicious! I've lost 116 pounds (moderte carbing, Primarian eating), and while I did order some (the minis, almond apricot, and others for hubby's lunch box), I think of them as CANDY. Not something to have in place of food, but something that I can have as a treat when I have the calories to allot. I also would happily carry a mini in my purse for emergencies. Because they have healthful fats, they can tide you over.<br /><br />How did they do on my glucose the way I use them (dessert):<br /><br />Premeal: glucose 81<br />Post meal: protein/veggies/fruit and one mango macadamia bar (after 1 hour): 88<br /><br />Not bad.<br /><br />I wish they'd ratchet down the glucose/honey, cause they could be less sweet. BUT...I cannot tell a lie: THESE TASTE DA BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I almost wish I'd never encountered them. They are tempting!<br /><br />And with the 25% off right now with S&S combined with the code good til 9/15, if you are dying to stock up, it's a good time.

review/text: I have a gluten allergy, so I am always looking for an alternative to cookies, muffins, granola bars, and other sweet snacks that I can no longer eat.  The Kind Bars are great - I have not found any that I absolutely don't like, but some I like better than others.  The Fruit and Nuts in Yogurt is definitely my favorite - I like the combination of nuts, raisins, and yogurt - it does not seem as overpoweringly sweet as some of the others. I originally discovered Kind Bars at Starbucks, but they were VERY expensive to buy on a regular basis. That was when I checked out Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, signed up for the Kind Bars, and cut my purchase cost by more than half - with no shipping cost!  What a cool program - especially for those of us with allergies who need regular access to products that are usually expensive and/or hard to find!

They are a great snack- they are very chewy & nutty.  I like them because I can't eat them quickly (which I often do with other bars) so I end up feeling more satisfied.  They have a great mix of almond & coconut flavor along with a very light honey tast.  Buy them- you won't be disappointed!

review/text: KIND bars are really the best of all the snack bars I've tried. They somehow manage to preserve the flavors and textures of the ingredients and still hold it together in a bar that's not overly sweet or salty. They do cost a little more than typical grocery store brands, so I watch for the occasional good sales and stock up. I find they have a pretty decent shelf life. With some of the other brands, I feel like there's often more filler and mystery ingredients than good stuff. With KIND, the fruit and nuts really take center stage. I haven't tried the ones with chocolate or yogurt.

I think the most telling thing that I can say is that more than a few times the first thing I've thought of when awaking in the morning is "morning! KIND bar time! mmmm!"  KIND touts their products' natural ingredients -- a claim, in my opinion, that is well backed by the ingredients lists and by the taste of these bars.<br /><br />My favorite types are Nut Delight; Peanut butter and Strawberry; and Sesame and Peanuts with Chocolate.  The Peanut Butter and Strawberry variety tastes just like a PB&J sandwich when you chew it up.<br /><br />These bars definitely get my stamp of approval.  Priced competitively @ Amazon as well.

My husband and my son do alot of strenuous, physical work. They both love KIND bars for the energy they provide. I highly recommend them over most any choice available. In fact I recently gave one to my mailman since he delivers them for Amazon. He loved it too.

review/text: These bars are tasty and healthy - my family loves them! My husband and I discovered these bars in our University's cafeteria; of course, it makes more sense to buy them from the internet. I always keep a couple of them in my office, a bar is a great lunch substitute when there is no time for lunch - or just a good, healthy snack.

review/text: I love ordering from Amazon because items come within a reasonable amount of time.  However, ordering from outside Amazon (except for books) not so much.  For example, I ordered 2 boxes each of Kind Bars.  The Fruit and Nut bars -- not a problem.  The Cranberry Almond Bars took way too long to arrive.

review/text: Well, we were recipients of a box of Kind bars...and were hooked. Ordered a variety of six different Kind bars from Amazon and settled in on the "simple" but delicious Nut<br />Delight as our personal favorite, with a couple of others which boast of dark chocolate as good substitutes...like the one with cherries. Kind is now our choice in the house for any "sweet treat." Enjoy!

review/summary: Tasty snack
review/text: These bars taste quite good, although I agree with other reviewers that there is a strong coconut taste.  Fine with me as I like coconut,  I've ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time.  I find them sticky, which makes them a bit messy if eaten while hiking or on a road trip.  Everyone I share them with polishes them off quickly.  Personally, when I look at the ingredients in Kind bars I don't have many fantasies that they are particularly healthy.  Honey is sugar.  Fruit and nuts are concentrated calories.  Healthy fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy will do a much better job of ensuring that I get the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that I need. Gluten free might help some folks.  I do not doubt that if you eat little pieces of the bars spaced out over several hours they don't encourage glycemic spiking when compared to a Snickers or some other candy.  Otherwise I simply regard them as a tasty snack that should not be expected to be anything more than that.

I'm not sure they count as "healthy", since they do have like 200 calories apiece and a fair bit of fat, but they claim to have a very low glycemic index (probably because of the nuts), so that's something.  Anyway, delicious.  I just wish it were possible to get them cheaper.

review/summary: Overpriced bars, but REALLY delicious!
review/text: These taste great: the apricot flavor is not too overpowering, the bar itself is not too sweet, and I personally love the coconut aspect of it. One bar is honestly enough to fill you up if you are hankering for a lunch but either can't make it, or are on a diet. I don't suggest it as a meal replacement though.<br /><br />Also, this bar is perfect for a post work-out snack, whether it be intense cardio, or weightlifting.<br /><br />My only question is some of the ingredients: "Chicory Fiber" and "Apple Fiber"?? Are these merely included to up the Fiber content to fool carb-conscious folks into picking these up? Are these fibers even effective fibers??<br /><br />USEFUL: If you hate coconut (which a lot of people inexplicably do), you will not like this bar. There seems to be an overabundance of coconut in this bar, from the combination of the "Shredded Coconut" and the "Coconut Chips". I am assuming they made those distinctions because combining them into one Coconut ingredient would have pushed it ahead of the other main ingredients on the list, and this is supposed to be an "Almond & Apricot" bar.

review/text: I purchased the Almond & Apricot bars for myself and enjoyed how fresh, tasty and convenient they are.  Well, my college aged son discovered them in my pantry on one of his weekends home - now I have to replenish the KIND bar stash frequently since he loves them as well.  His favorite variety is the Macadamia nut one but he also lieks the Fruit & Nut delight.  We both like they are nutritious and filling without being overly sweet.  Well worth the money!

review/summary: Love these bars!
review/text: I discovered these bars some time ago at my local grocery store - they were on this little display with some other things. The next time I went there, I couldn't find them. And I couldn't really remember what they were called. So, I was very excited when I saw them at Starbucks probably a year later. They are, of course, way too expensive there! I wasn't able to find them reliably anywhere around town, so I found them online and now I have two boxes (two different flavors) auto-shipped to me from Amazon. Now I have begun to see these in stores more often so I've been trying some other flavors.<br /><br />I used to eat Kashi cereal each morning but now I have one of these bars with my requisite Dr. Pepper. I'm not sure how long ago I changed my breakfast choice, but I have lost about 15 pounds (that needed to be lost) since I changed over to the bars. I definitely didn't change earlier than November, 2010. And, instead of being starving at 11 a.m., I don't get seriously hungry until later.*<br /><br />* These claims have not been evaluated by anyone, and no animals have been tortured to prove them.
