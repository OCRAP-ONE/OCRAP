review/text: All of the local health food and/or grocery stores sell this same size for $14.  The issue is buying enough to have plenty in the pantry, which is why I would like to order it from Amazon.  However, the crazy price keeps me making multiple trips to the grocery to build up our stock.

review/summary: May contain high levels of arsenic
review/text: I researched many formulas before purchasing this one because it seemed the MOST organic and safe for my baby. On 2/16/12 Consumer Reports published research indicating that formulas containing organic brown rice syrup -- the first ingredient in Baby's Only formula -- have high levels of arsenic.<br /><br />From Consumer Reports: "Two of 17 infant formulas tested listed organic brown rice syrup as the primary ingredient. One had a total arsenic concentration that was six times the federal limit of 10 parts per billion (ppb) for total arsenic in bottled or public drinking water. This is particularly worrisome for babies because they are especially vulnerable to arsenic's toxic effects due to their small size and the corresponding arsenic consumption per pound of body weight."<br /><br />It did not list the brands of formula, but to be safe I will not be feeding this formula to my child.<br />[...]

review/summary: AMAZING if your baby has painful gas or colic get this formula!
review/text: This is the second review I have ever written.  The first was right before this for Enfamil Gentlease (do NOT buy it, it's disgusting and doesn't work) I can't nurse because I never got any milk so formula was my only option.  After 9 weeks of screaming all day, terrible tummy aches, only eating 1-2oz a feeding, feeding every hour, restless sleep, GAS LIKE CRAZY, 4 different formulas and tons of gas drops, I finally found this formula.  WOW what a difference.  I thought my son has colic and reflux.  NOPE.  It was his formula.  After switching to this formula, the first bottle I gave him, I immediately saw a change.  First of all, he didn't pull away from the nipple like he had been doing.  He didn't fart once while eating (first time) didn't scream and was soooo happy after he was done.  He took 4 ounces and slept for 3 hours after the first bottle (and continues to do so) I only wish I had found this formula sooner.

review/summary: Love that it's organic but why so sweet?
review/text: The jury's still out on whether or not the baby likes it.  She is an EBF baby.  However, my only reason for taking off a star is - why is this formula so sweet?  It tastes like a milkshake!  I feel like I'm training the baby's taste buds to prefer super sweet foods and I don't want to put her on a road for future obesity!!!  The other formulas are not this sweet and therefore, I almost feel like I have to mix it with another brand that isn't quite so cloying.  Does this have the same amount of sugar (rice syrup or not, sugar is sugar!) as the other brands?

As always consult your physician, but when you compare nutrition info it is almost the same as the infant formula that we were using.

review/summary: The only formula that agreed with our baby
review/text: Our baby had lactose sensitivity, which caused him to have terrible gas.  I breast fed him but I never produced enough milk so we needed to supplement with formula.  It seemed no matter which formula we tried, he still had some gas.  Finally we tried this one, and bingo!  No more gas!  Our son is now two and I still give him this a couple times a week because he's such a picky eater nowadays and I know it has the nutrients he needs.

review/summary: So much better than anythign else out there!!!!
review/text: I love this formula and so does my son. I looked everywhere for formula that was for lactose and soy intolerant baby's and between similac alimentum and Nutramigen my poor son didn't really want anything to do with them. I found this company and on a whim bought a can and my son not only loved it but couldn't get enough of it the first week we had it. He acted better and I couldn't believe the difference. I'm not on WIC so I'm not getting any aid for my son's formula but for what this stuff is its a heck of a lot cheaper than the other 2 options. a 12 oz can of nutramigen usually runs about $30 and similac alimentium is no better. TO find an organic lactose and soy free formula that is only $15 a can is AWESOME. I Prefer ordering it through the company it's self because they are cheaper than amazon and have some really great organic options for my older son as well. Natures One Direct.com is the company that makes this formula and they are great to work with. A+++++++++

review/summary: Seems like great formula at first...
review/text: I have been giving this formula to my son for 8 months. I was unaware of the issues with brown rice syrup & arsenic. Unfortunately there seem to be too many unknowns not to mention unhelpful customer service from the company.<br /><br />One of the boxes containing 6 cans of formula appeared completely free of damages but when I opened it I was shocked to find all 6 cans severely dented. They were so badly damaged the seals were forced open and the formula powder leaked out of the cans and into the box. Needless to say it is now an inconvenience to return them and a bigger inconvenience because I have to find a different formula to use. I truly envy people who do not have to use formula and deal with quality control issues some of which may prove to have serious health consequences.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received a call from another customer service rep. She was much more helpful than the initial rep. I spoke with. She resolved my issues with the damaged cans. I am still not sure what to do about the brown rice and arsenic issue. My infant is lactose intolerant & sensitive to the added DHA/ARA in other formulas so my only other option seems like Soy based formula which also has its own set of issues. (I sure wish I didn't have to use formula but it is what it is... I will do my best choosing healthy foods as he grows up.) I have changed my initial one star rating to three due to the company at least resolving the issues with my damaged products.

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: I can't tell you how many times I have switched my 8 week old son's formula.  We have tried Enfamil Newborn, AR, and Gentlease, we have tried Baby's Only Soy, Dairy and Similac Alimentum.  Every single one caused my baby some kind of problem, from spitting up to  constipation, gas, and pain while eating.  At 5 weeks he was diagnosed with silent reflux and put on rantidine three times a day.  I did not want to give him prescription drugs at 5 weeks old, but I thought I would try it.  He was in so much pain, it was awful to watch.  It was also affecting his sleep because he could not lie flat without having pain.<br /><br />To make a long story short, the rantidine did nothing to help his reflux.  After two weeks I decided to call it quits.  My pediatrician gave me samples of Alimentum because we suspected a milk protein allergy.  The Allimentum did no good and gave him diarrhea.  I switched back to Gentlease, even though it produced horrible green swamp poops and did not really help anything either.  I almost gave up looking for a good formula, assuming that they were all horrible.<br /><br />We tried everything I could find.  First we bought a probiotic and started that once a day.  It seemed to help aid digestion but did nothing to ease his pain.  Then we switched from Avent to Dr. Brown's bottles, which cut down on the gas and helped a little bit more.  Finally, I decided to give this formula a try.  I was in the middle of a feeding of Gentlease, and he was crying in pain.  Just for kicks I popped open a can of the Baby's Only Lactorelief and BAM!  No pain!  He literally stopped crying right in the middle of the feed, gulped down 4 ounces, and crashed.<br /><br />I did not realize until visiting the NaturesOne website that they do compare this formula to Enfamil Gentlease and Similac Sensitive.  It's the only sensitive organic formula on the market.  The ingredients are similar to that of the other brands but it does not contain corn or hexane-derived DHA/ARA.  It smells and tastes a ton better.<br /><br />I don't think my son is lactose intolerant.  Or maybe he is.  There are also theories out there that some babies are sensitive to corn or DHA.  Whatever the problem, I don't care.  After two days of eating this formula, the only time we are experiencing any discomfort is when he has to burp.  Even that seems very minimal and the burps are easier to coax out.  I always wondered how long I should wait to see results from a new formula.  A day?  A week?  A month?  In this case, I have seen improvement from the very first feed.  I won't say it's perfect yet, but he may have inflammation from the previous formula.  I will update.<br /><br />I know how frustrating it can be to figure out what the problem is if your baby is having reflux issues.  It's trial by fire until you nail something down.  If you are feeding Enfamil Gentlease or Similac Sensitive and would prefer an organic alternative, this is for you.  Please do not let these people who insist that the arsenic will hurt your baby scare you.  Do some research on hexane and DHA and decide which is worse, potential small amounts of arsenic (which is naturally occurring from volcanic activities in the areas of the world where rice is grown) or the hexane derivation process.  This is the ONLY formula on the market which does not contain DHA/ARA.<br /><br />Yes, it's expensive.  But so are Alimentum and Nutramigen, and if your baby needs it, it's worth its weight in gold.  I'm so glad it's working for us, and I could not be happier with it.<br /><br />Update 9-14-12<br />Still working great!  After two weeks, it's almost like my son never had reflux at all!  We still get the occasional feed where he has an episode, but I think that might be stomach related and since he can't tell me, I'll never know.  It seems to help to burp thoroughly when he gets that way.<br /><br />Update 10-3-12<br />Over a month later we are still loving this formula.  I had an extra can of the Dairy formula lying around and wanted to use it up.  It instantly gave my son horrible gas and an upset stomach.  I think he really does have a lactose sensitivity.  I'm so glad Nature's One makes this organic lactose-free formula.  My son is growing and thriving on it, with no reflux issues to speak of.

review/text: In the beginning, we fed our baby Enfamil, Similac and even Baby's Only Organic Dairy but she was very fussy and was constipated. We then changed to the Lactose Free formula and all the fuss and constipation went away. She is 6 months now and has been drinking the Lactose Free for almost 5 months. We love it. No more tummy trouble. This brand is however a little pricey. It's a good idea to shop around for the best price.

review/text: First of all, I LOVE this formula! My daughter is a pretty sensitive little thing and she transitioned to this formula very well from the breast milk and no tummy troubles to speak of. I thoroughly researched the arsenic scare and it was not refering to this formula. Nature's One tests their brown rice syrup and guarantees that their product does not contain arsenic.<br />Now onto the main reason for my review...DO NOT buy from Amazon because they are way overpriced. This formula can be found on other sites like [...] for $13.19 onsale (that's including shipping) or you can purchase it at your local Sprouts for $13.99 pre-tax. Why spend more here when it's already a pricy formula?

review/text: This is by far my favorite formula that we've tried. After much research, I decided this brand was the best organic formula that we could find quite easily. My daughter is 8 months old now and I needed something to occasionally supplement when she's with grandma, etc. I'm not sure if she's lactose intolerant but I always found it strange that pediatricians advise not to give babies milk, however all formulas are made with milk or soy. To be on the safe side, I tried this lactose free version and it has worked out great. She loves it and we've never had any bad reactions whatsoever. Who knows why it costs almost $25 on Amazon. Whole Foods even sells it for practically half that! I highly recommend this formula.

review/summary: Revised review
review/text: My original review was full of praise of this formula, it's still down below this one. However, I have to give the company and their formula 1 star after the events of the past week. On Feb 16th their two main formula brands, dairy and soy, both tested very high for arsenic (organic and inorganic versions). The company promised to conduct their own testing and come back with their findings. Today they got their results back from their third party laboratory, but refuse to share the findings from said laboratory. They claim that their formula upholds to the FDA regulations, but since there are no FDA regulations for arsenic in food, that really doesn't hold any merit. I really wished and hoped that the company would come back and discredit the arsenic-study, however, this in my eyes just proved that the study was correct. I am currently on the lookout for another brand of formula for my baby.<br /><br />This is my original review:<br /><br />Our daughter has been really fussy and slept really poorly when we fed her a major brand formula. We tried said major brands formula for gassy and fussiness, but she refused to drink it. Then we got this formula at a national chain healthy food store. She loves the stuff. It smells and tastes much nicer than other formulas (yes, I have tasted formula) and resembled my breastmilk better than other formulas. I wish we had known about this formula when I needed to supplement her, because she would refuse to drink other formula if she was receiving breastmilk and I think she would gladly have drank this one.<br /><br />Anyway, after 4 days on this formula, she would sleep through the night and not wake up grumping and groaning at night. We couldn't afford more cans right now, so we went back to the major brand formula yesterday, and last night she woke up 5-6 times complaining as well as waking up for a night time feed.

review/summary: Please research this formula carefully before using!
review/text: I used this formula for my baby from 6 weeks old to 1 year after trying to nurse unsuccessfully.  He tolerated it well and I thought this was a terrific product while using it.  I am now horrified to learn about the extremely high arsenic levels found in organic brown rice syrup in a very recent Darmouth College study.  Nature's One conducted a study to test the arsenic levels, but the company has stated it will not release the results of the study to the public, which is very troubling.  Nature's One states its formula is safe under FDA guidelines, but the FDA has no guidelines for arsenic in food, let alone baby formula.  So, please do your research before using this for your baby.

review/text: My son (now 6mos) has been on Soy since he was almost a week old due to Reflux and vomiting after eating (early on - not so much anymore). He still gets heart burn and  though he liked the formula overall, we noticed more spit-up and/or vomiting after drinking formula that was not his regular (Enfamil ProSobee). We'd like to move him into Lactose Free cow's milk formula, but at the advice of the doctor we're temp keeping him on the Enfamil. We'll probably try again in a few months with this LF Organic Formula. I did read that it was one of the best organic formulas on the market - but be aware it is made with brown rice syrup. Given the alternative for Lactose Free formula (corn syrup), this OVERALL was a better option (and less expensive!!!). BTW I've noticed that SOME Whole Foods sells this formula as well for about the same price or a few pennies less.

review/text: I have in the past used a lot of Barry Farm products.  In the majority of cases, I have found their dried veggies and such to be of a great flavor and quality, and an excellent substitute in most cases for the real thing.  Especially when the real thing just takes too long or is not available.  Some of their products are far more worth the cost then others.  This carrot powder is one that is both worth your time and money and delicious as well.  I have used it on camping trips for quite a few years past.  Although carrots are an ingredient in most soups and stews, they also are one veggie that takes the longest to cook.  Hence the introduction of Barry's carrot powder on my wilderness trips.  Sprinkle a couple of heaping tablespoons or so into any campfire soup or stew, or one at home for that matter, and you will be rewarded with a much richer carrot taste than you would ever imagine from a powder.  It is a very flavorful addition where a little goes a long way, and also carries a much fresher taste than you would assume as well.  It dissolves and flavors almost immediately, and it is very easy to pack and tote along with all your other camping 'possibles.  My only reason for taking off one star is the shipping on this powder is way too heavy in my opinion for such a light, easily packable item.  But I recommend doing what I do for all Barry Farm products.  Order a bunch of the powder, or any combination of Barry products all at once, and the shipping charge changes very little making it a square deal.  I recommend this carrot powder as a very easy and flavorful alternative to the real deal.  Enjoy...

review/summary: Doesn't taste good.
review/text: I don't know what I was thinking. The carrot powder looks yellowish. Probably all the beta carotene are all gone. I hoping to use them on my smoothies but it's has no taste to it. It looks and smells old. I can smell the plastic bag better than the carrot powder. No details if it's freeze dried or regular drying method. This would affect on what's left nutritionally.

review/summary: Good, tasty coffee
review/text: Coffee is tough to review because it's so subjective. I've bought coffee that had outstanding reviews on Amazon and I ended up hating it.<br />I've been ordering <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027Z8VES">Kicking Horse Coffee Kick Ass Dark, Whole Bean Coffee</a> for about a year now. It's good stuff and shipped free with Amazon Prime.<br />But I was ready for a change so I gave this Raven's Brew Wicked Wolf coffee a try.<br />I like it a lot. It's not quite as strong as the Kicking Horse coffee I've been drinking. But nor is it as bitter or acidic.<br />My wife likes this coffee much more than Kicking Horse so that's a bonus.<br />This is a good change from Kicking Horse and I'm looking forward to trying the other Raven's Brew blends.

review/summary: for true coffee connoisseurs
review/text: This brew is a VERY robust and chocolatey coffee. If bold brews are your favorite, this is the right blend for you. It offsets sweets and desserts well because of its strong aroma and flavor. It also has cacao undertones of its own that will remind you of a dark chocolate bar. It is NOT a very good iced coffee unless you plan to use it as an iced mocha.<br />In a french press: be sure that you add a little extra beans, itll give this blend that extra punch that makes it chocolatey. be VERY careful not to over brew, 3-4 minutes is enough. It will quickly go bitter if you aren't careful (I smell it on occasion to make sure it doesnt get bitter).<br />Compared to other Raven's Blends: This is definitely one of their darkest roasts. If you're not sure what to expect, expect VERY robust full bodied flavor. This blend has a very full bodied cacao flavor.

review/summary: FIRST ORDER LOST - FLOWERS SCRAWNY
review/text: First order was "lost."  Since this arrangement was for a birthday, it was distressing that it did not arrive anywhere close to on-time.  The flowers themselves were "thin" looking, according to the recipient (well, I asked her to be honest and she was).  Previous orders from this seller were great -- don't know what's happened, but several friends have advised that they have experienced similar problems with delivery - and quality - in recent months, so I will order elsewhere in the future.

review/summary: I am displaying two vases of 18 roses apiece
review/text: I am very pleased with this order of 36 ProFlowers "Rainbow" (read:  assorted color) roses.  They arrived yesterday in good shape; fortunately they were bundled in two bunches of 18 roses apiece with hydration sponges attached, which probably mitigated the effect of riding around in a UPS van for 8+ hours with Chicago temps well into the Nineties (35 C).  As is my wont I gave them a good overnight soaking before trimming and arranging, and since ProFlowers generously enclosed four packets of the floral preserver powder I was able to use one per vase (two "amethyst" trumpets from prior ProFlowers orders) of 18 flowers apiece.  The roses are opening up quickly and beautifully (I will attach a photo later today) and needed very little arranging.  The colors are about an equal mix of orange, yellow, red-tipped white and red-tipped pink.  (It never occurred to me to expect any red roses, but I'll mention there were none for the sake of people who seem to expect some.)  My arrangements added no extra greenery, just what came with the roses.  My experience has been that with re-trimming and fresh water (with remaining preserver powder) on about day three or four, the roses will look fine well over a week.  Since these blooms are quite attractive and nothing went wrong, I'm giving a ***** rating.

review/text: My 9 1/2 month old daughter has loved this since she tasted it when she was 7 months.  I have tasted it, and it's delicious.  It's convenient for on the go or to have handy as a snack.  The ingredients are mangoes and &lt;1% Organic Lemon Juice.  The consistency is nice and thick (like that of apple butter) so it isn't dripping off the spoon.  Also if you feel confident enough, you or your child can squeeze it right in his/her mouth.  Ella's products are expensive, but I think their products are worth it, and my daughter has loved every variety we have tried except the pumpkin combo.  Love all the fruits--pears, apples and these mangoes.  This also provides 40% of Vitamin C.

review/summary: Yummy cupcakes! How about altering for cake?
review/text: These made very tasty cupcakes.  The directions say to fill up the paper cups to the top, but I would not recommend that.  I came close to the top filling 12 cups,and the cupcakes "overflowed" and stuck to one another.  They still tasted great, but didn't look as great as they could.<br /><br />I also wish the box mix would make a full recipe of Ina's cupcakes like other box mixes.  It says it only makes 10.  I did get 12, and probably could have gotten 14 out of the mix, but I would have liked to make 18-24 like her from-scratch recipe.<br /><br />Finally, I wish they would put directions for making a full cake.  I tried one box mix to make 2 9" circles, but they were too thin because it really only is a 1/2 recipe -- something I didn't realize until after the cake attempts.

review/text: Unbelievably tasty for a boxed cupcake mix! Easy to follow instructions...foolproof in my opinion. Makes nice dense crumb (which I personally like). I used a texas muffin pan and made 9 husky cupcakes. Cream cheese icing does make all thing better (much like bacon), but I am behind these cupcakes plain or iced! Am about to put in an order for a pack of 3. The final product with the sprinkling of grated coconut makes it look like you worked much harder than just stir things together...so they'll be impressive enough to bring to work.

It has 320 calories and 5g of fat and although it is not marketed as 'diet' or 'healthy' it is inline nutritionally with them. Maybe it is just the shape of the container but it feels like more food too.<br />I don't like spicy food per se but this has a tiny kick to it- nothing crazy spicy.<br />It cooks in 60sec which is awesome too. The pasta may have a slightly more 'dense' (not dente)feel to it if that makes sense but really tastes very fresh. Hope amazon stocks these soon!

review/text: The sauce is tangy and spicy without going overboard.  I also love that its separate from the pasta.  Usually for these kinds of meals you cook the pasta in the sauce and you get crusty edges on the whole mess.  Leaving the sauce and pasta apart seemed to help the consistancy.<br /><br />The pasta was slightly chewy but I didn't mind, and the meal was surprisingly filling while still being under 400 calories.<br /><br />Eating one of these is not exactly the same as going to an Italian restaurant, of course, but if you like these kinds of microwave meals, this is about as good as any that I've found.

review/summary: good flavor and texture, but not sure I'd buy it
review/text: The good:  Prepared according to directions, the pasta is just right (al dente).  The sauce in this variety has a nice amount of spice in it; the other variety I tried was bland in comparison.<br /><br />The not so good:  I'm not really sure who is going to pay a relatively premium price for a single serve, shelf-stable pasta dish.  I suppose that if you don't have access to a freezer or your freezer space is limited at work and you want to have an alternative to eating lunch out, this product would suit you.  But, quite honestly, I cannot imagine being satisfied with JUST eating this dish by itself since it really is just pasta and marinara sauce with no meat, no chunky vegetables, no cheese, etc.  Pretty boring, not incredibly filling, and not as nutritious as it could be.<br /><br />As I wrote in my review for the other variety I tried, I think it's wise to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.  The lid/film on these trays is glued on quite well, and once the sauce is hot I can imagine it would be quite easy to burn yourself or, at least, find the pasta and sauce flying all over the counter if you attempt to remove the film too quickly.<br /><br />I almost rated this 4 stars but, in reality, a fair rating would be 3.5 stars.  Because I honestly don't think I'd buy this product, I think rounding down to 3 stars is more fair than rounding up to 4, even though I did like the flavor of this product.

I don't usually like Spicy things but my husband does so I figured if I didn't like it he'd eat it.<br />It was super easy and fast to make in the microwave.  After it cooled down I slowly took a bite of it (was a little afraid of the "spicy").  I was nicely suprised to see that it wasn't HOT spicy, I could take another bite.  I ate half of the package and it didn't burn my mouth, it was yummy and had good tomato flavor.  I gave the rest to hubby and he liked it also.  Unlike me, he does like the HOT spicy so he was a bit disappointed in that aspect of it but he ate the other half of it and said it was "pretty good".  That's a compliment from him and he'd be willing to try their other varieties and so would I.  I'll have to see what else they have and try some more!

review/text: I was hoping this would serve two but it is really a single serving and you probably need a salad on the side to make a meal. If you only want a quick snack or a light lunch then it suites just fine. I liked the entire concept of sauce in a separate container that you pour on and mix in. (We don't eat many microwave meals so this was new to me.) I added a little extra water as the instructions advised if you wanted a softer pasta. The sauce has a nice kick to it, but I would not call it spicy. I would definitely purchase this for a quick meal. The price seems right for a pack of 6. (We tried the whole wheat pasta too, but prefer this one.)

review/summary: Easy to prepare
review/text: This dish was extremely easy to prepare, but the film lid stuck to the sauce compartment, which sits loosely inside the main compartment, so I almost burned my fingers. Taste-and-texture-wise it was fine (compared to other ready meals) but the sauce was not spicy, at least not in the "caliente" sense. Very tomatoey though and pleasant enough.

review/summary: Quick to prepare and sweet but not spicy
review/text: My wife and I tried this out recently. I liked it more than she did, and so I'm averaging our rating to a 4 star.<br /><br />First off, this is very easy to prepare. Only 1 minute to microwave! (as per the instructions). Our microwave is pretty powerful (about 1500W) and the 1 minute was perfect. You have to peel back a little of the cover to the dotted line before microwaving. And after microwaving, we let it sit for a minute or so.<br /><br />The penne seemed to be just right in consistency. The sauce is in a separate bowl and you have to mix it all together. My wife's complaint is mostly about the sauce - that it was too sweet. And she's right. Also the sauce was definitely not spicy. We added some crushed red peppers, as well as some grated cheese, and it tasted wonderful!<br /><br />Overall I would buy this again. But I would definitely add more spices and the cheese to make it taste better.

review/summary: Quick, Easy, Tastey, Relatively Cost-Effective, but Not Entirely Cost Effective
review/text: Good, healthy meals on the go that don't taste like cardboard are hard to come by these days.  Most "healthy" alternatives, especially the gluten-free type, usually have no flavor or make one cringe when chewing.<br /><br />Barilla has alleviated much of this problem with their ready-to-go mezze penne microwavable meals.  When they say, "ready in less than a minute," on the box they really meant it.  Within two minutes of pulling the packaging out of my cabinet I was ready to scarf it down. The meal takes one minute in the microwave as it has water that prepares the noodles while simultaneously warming up the sauce, which is in an independently sealed pouch.  Pretty straight forward similar to Easy Mac.<br /><br />The meal was somewhat tasty as I love spice and it had some hints of it, however, I found myself putting in some hot sauce just to 'spice' things up a bit (you'll pardon the pun).  You could also add you own meat but such preparation would kinda defeat the purpose of the "less than 1-minute" food boast.<br /><br />My only real gripe is the cost as they're hardly cost effective.  It is considerably cheaper to make you own and you can make them in larger quantities but, such is the problem with ANY quick meals.<br /><br />All in all, tasty and very easy on the go but the cost needs to come down first in order to truly be practical.

review/summary: Add your own meat
review/text: Barilla is making several different microwave meatless pasta dishes. The sauce and the pasta come out very tasty when following the directions on the box. They are handy to take to work for lunch as they do not have to be refridgerated. I don't care for just meatless pasta so I add an italian sausage or a couple of meatballs and this makes a good lunch or snack.

review/summary: Quick Tasty Lunch
review/text: If you can't get away from your desk to go out for lunch or down to the cafeteria, this is a quick and easy way to have lunch.<br /><br />Preparation is stupid simple. Remove the cardboard overwrap, peel back to film a bit,  nuke for one minute, peel off the film, dump the sauce onto the pasta, and enjoy.<br /><br />In my 1100 W microwave, the cook time is just about perfect. The sauce was sufficiently hot and the pasta was cooked through nicely. I like the firmness of the pasta. The sauce has nice chunks of tomato and good flavor. It also has a nice spice kick that's not so hot that will melt your teeth. I thought the portions of size was sufficient. I would like to see them find a way to add a small packet of grated cheese. That would be a nice addition.<br /><br />The ingredient list is good, with no preservatives and no artificial flavors. As with all packaged foods the sodium content is a bit high at 29% of the recommended daily allowance. That's the only drawback there is to this product.<br /><br />In my area, I can recycle all of the pieces of the packaging except for the protective film. That is a plus in my opinion.<br /><br />At the time of this writing, these cost approximately $3.37 each, which is in line with Barilla's suggested retail price of $2.99. Since these are eligible for free Super Saver shipping, you could have the convenience of having them delivered to your front door for free. The way I see it that's a win all the way around.<br /><br />I have tried other varieties of this product and found them to be equally good.<br /><br />Bottom line: While I would probably not eat these everyday, they are tasty, quick, and easy lunch that's not too hard on the wallet. Several varieties of this will always be in my pantry or the bottom drawer of my desk.

review/summary: Amazingly fast & great taste.
review/text: It really only took 60 seconds-REALLY! Other noodle dinners I have tried take 3 or more minutes (and then once they're cooked enough, you have to wait until they cool enough to eat). So if you have a half hour for your lunch hour, this is a great choice. The packaging is really ingenious.<br /><br />We recently had a Barilla sauce from a jar at home that I thought was a bit bland; but this was good. Tomato and a touch of red-pepper heat.<br /><br />Also in its favor is the fact that it is all natural. The fewer ingredients, the better & there aren't a lot here. 320 calories & 29% of the sodium you need in a day (so it's not perfect...but I'd really rather have the all natural than a chemical cocktail that has fewer calories).<br /><br />It IS a little expensive. Nearly 6$ per if you purchase here...strangely the Barilla Mezze Penne with Tomato and Basil Sauce is less than 4$...so save money with that one! It's probably just as good!

review/summary: Tastes great, but use care when preparing
review/text: This is the first time I've tried a microwaveable pasta product, and I found it to be quite good. The sauce was indeed spicy (I love spicy) and the flavor, while not quite as good as something you'd buy in a jar, was better than I expected. I liked the pasta, too. This isn't something I'd have regularly at home (I'd prefer to just cook pasta) but wouldn't mind eating regularly at work or some other place. I can see myself stocking up on a few.<br /><br />However, use extreme care when preparing. I followed the preparation instructions on the package and managed to give myself a first-degree burn. One side of the tray contains a removable sauce cup, the other the pasta. The idea is to peel back the cover a tad (for ventilation), microwave the food, then peel back the cover from the sauce cup and tray and dump the sauce on the pasta. Since the cover is stuck on the sauce cup there is a place to hold the sauce cup with your thumb while removing the cover.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the cover adheres very well to the sauce cup. When trying to remove the cover my thumb slipped and hot pasta sauce dumped all over my right hand, resulting in a burn. Next time I think I'll peel back the cover to expose the sauce cup completely, and then put the cover back down and hold it in place with a small microwave-safe bowl while microwaving.

review/summary: Quite decent for microwave pasta
review/text: A decent pasta with an average sauce (comparable to jarred).  Barilla is my usual pasta, and mezze penne something I always stock at home, so I was curious how their prepackaged meals are.<br /><br />The very brief (60-seconds) microwaving results in a penne a little softer than my usual al-dente, but surprisingly "normal pasta" despite coming out of a microwave package.  The sauce is a generic marinara.  Edible but nothing exciting, similar to jarred.  If you make your own sauces (which I highly recommend, very easy), this sauce will taste a bit "fake" to you.  It has only minor heat despite being labeled "spicy" (although that may be versus sugar-heavy old-fashioned American marinaras), but for us spice-lovers, I added both cayenne and red pepper flakes to get to the preferred level of zing.<br /><br />The microwave tray is a coated paperboard with a plastic insert for the sauce, so it's not all plastic (I try to avoid heating food in plastic when possible).  The serving is a lightweight 320 calories.  At my recommended 2500 calorie daily intake, this would qualify as a snack.<br /><br />These seem like they'd be expensive per "meal" compared to making pasta yourself, and too low-calorie to be a meal by themselves for most adults.  But still handy if you have poor kitchen access, or for brown-bagging to work/school.<br /><br />Recommended for a "quick pasta meal".

review/summary: Quite good for what it is
review/text: This is a non-refrigerated, microwaveable meal containing pasta and tomato sauce. The packaging states that it is "All Natural" and contains "No Preservatives." How Barilla is able to give us tomato sauce in liquid form but without any chemicals to keep it palatable is a mystery to me. The plasticized tray packaging is sealed tightly with a stout film cover, so I guess that's the key.<br /><br />The primary ingredient is Mezze Penne pasta which is made with Semolina wheat and Durum flour. The one portion will give you 6 grams of fiber (24% of a 2000-calorie diet). For those of us who have reached the stage of life where fiber intake is critical, this is a wonderful bonus.<br /><br />This is the second one of these Barilla meals that I've tried. I liked the first, but found the Penne a little too tough for my taste, so this time I followed Barilla's instructions "for softer pasta," and after cooking, added a teaspoon of water and cooked for another 30 seconds. This helped but, unfortunately, I still found the pasta just a little rubbery. I have an 1100-watt microwave, and found the 1-minute cooking time plus the additional 30 seconds fine.<br /><br />The rest of the ingredient list yields nothing suspicious other than "Natural Flavors," and "Tapioca Starch."<br /><br />The Tomato sauce is packaged in a separate "Sauce Tray" which fits in the main packaging and is microwaved with it. When heating is complete, you remove the sauce tray and pour it over the pasta. That works fine. Prior to heating, you peel back the film covering over the sauce to vent the package. I had no difficulties with any of this. Just be careful to read the instructions before you do anything.<br /><br />The package will give you 320 calories with 5g of fat and 700mg of sodium. The sodium is high (29%) as it is in virtually all pre-packaged meals. It seems the manufacturers have learned how to control all the nutrients--calories, fat, cholesterol, carbs, everything--except salt.<br /><br />I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat this, but for what it is--an ultrasimple, convenient, quick meal that you could stick in your briefcase or backpack on the way out to work or school--it was pretty good. The Arrabbiata sauce was quite tasty. If you don't have access to a cafeteria and don't want something from the deli or the take-out or fast-food places, this is definitely a good alternative.<br /><br />I just need to say a word about price: I never base my ratings on price, because that can change with time and retailer and sales, but DO NOT pay 40 bucks for 6 of these shipped. That's just plain nuts. At two or three dollars apiece, they make sense. At six plus, they don't.

The pasta is firm and the marinara sauce has a kick. Spicy is good! I love that it contains no preservatives. Also, it has 11g of protein which makes it a good afternoon snack before heading out to soccer practice. We have also tried the other flavors and have not been disappointed. The only downside is the price.

review/summary: Good pasta, sauce
review/text: I was excited to find a pasta meal with spicy sauce as I'm a big fan of fra diavolo sauces.  While not as spicy as I would have liked, this sauce had a good flavor and it was on the sweet side with chunks of tomatoes mixed in.  The pasta (fiber enhanced semolina) was perfect - firm and tasty.  I shared this with my sister and niece (we were doing a "taste test" of different versions...) and they liked this, too.<br /><br />The one minute in the microwave was plenty of time - meal was hot enough.  The top - a sealed piece of plastic that you peel off over the sauce to cook then fully remove to pour the sauce over the pasta - is a bit difficult to remove.  I slopped some sauce trying to get it off so if you're making these at work, be careful.<br /><br />Calorie wise, this was just over 300 calories and had 6 grams of fiber.  The portion is very generous (I thought...) and the sodium content, while not low, isn't too bad (around 700 mg).  I also like the fact that this line has no "mystery" ingredients.  I would definitely buy this again and only taking off a star for the packaging.

review/text: The Barilla Mezze Penne with Spicy Marinara Sauce is ready in 60 seconds from the microwave.  The sauce has Barilla's usual high quality and the red pepper gives it just the right amount of "kick" to make it spicy good.  After heating, you pour the sauce over the penne, which comes out nice and firm. This pasta meal has 320 calories, 0 cholesterol, 700 mg sodium and 6g fiber. Combine this with a green salad and a slice of French Bread and one can have a scrumptuous meal in just a few minutes' time.  One of the best 60-second meals around.

review/summary: Ultra FAST, this is the 60 Second soultion!  GREAT Taste, too!
review/text: One of the BEST new products I have tried this year (2012). Unlike some other meals, in simi;ar pachages, this is fully cooked ,and ready eat in just 60 seconds!<br /><br />I became aware of this product at a "craft service" table on a television shoot that went in to the wee hours - it is really good!  Perfect for a lunch, or perhaps a side-dish.  Or... when you get home, and are too tired to cook ANYTHING ( been there, done THAT ).<br /><br />Barilla has always had good pasta and sauce, and this flavor should be familar to you, if you have tried them before.  The KEY feature here is ease of prep. If you can, add in some grated cheese and a salad, and you have a meal in minutes.<br /><br />While popular on TV and movie sets, this could easily be a a terrific "comfort food" gift for seniors, college students, or perhaps someone not feeling up to par.<br /><br />I like the spicy formula, though there are several others, without the minor "kick".  Is it "al-dente"?, no, but is it darn good. Plate it (or even paper-plate it) and you will enjoy a fast-casual premium dining option.<br /><br />The Amazon price is great, and is LOWER than what I saw in a wharehouse store this weekend- the individual packs are around $4.00 each, at regular retail, and are well worth it.<br /><br />Do consider this for yourself, it is a bit of everyday luxury.  And, like I said, consider those seniors, and college students - I ASSURE you this would be a most welcome gift!

review/summary: Barilla Mezze Penne with Spicy Marinara Sauce
review/text: Let me start by saying I love Barilla sauces. It's the only sauce I buy in the jar to use and their marinara in the jar is the best base I've ever used. This however was terrible. I was completely disappointed. I heated it as per instructions but needed to heat it another 45 seconds after mixing it up in a microwaveable bowl because it was only just warm. It is not very spicy at all and I could mainly only taste tomatoes. The pasta had a very strange taste to it, not sure how to describe it but I had to make myself finish it. I wanted to throw it out but I'm not a wasteful person so I ate it. There is well under 2 cups total to eat so if you were giving it to a very young child it may be enough but I had to go make my lunch after eating it as I felt like I had nothing to eat and, NO, I am not a big eater. Usually just a sandwich is more than enough for me for a meal. I would not buy this in a store for any price. I feel like I even wasted my electricity by heating it. Glad I got this from vine so it was free or I'd really be mad as this is expensive for what little you get even if it had been good and I'm glad I have already used Barilla products because if this had been my first taste of theirs I would never use anything of theirs.

review/summary: Delicious, rustic pasta
review/text: I've bought the packs of BioNaturae Tagliatelle and the Pappardelle (wider) several times from Amazon. They are nice noodles, and have much more character than most plain pastas.<br /><br />The texture is slightly coarse, and the taste hints strongly of egg. Good with red, white and other sauces. Also makes a great kugel. I find that a pack serves around 3-4, depending on the dish. (This means that I use around 2/3 of a pack for dinner for two, so I often have a partial pack in my pantry.<br /><br />Note, of the several times I have bought, the have suffered various offenses during shipping, so sometimes the nests of pasta are totally intact and long, and sometimes they are relatively shattered, but it turns out not to matter a whole lot when you are eating. Broken pasta is still plenty long, and fine for eating.<br /><br />I like the wider pappardelle more, as they have a more rustic feel.

review/summary: Very good chocolate you can feel good about
review/text: Given all of the geopolitics involved in the cocoa trade, this is a very good choice. It is dark without being too bitter or too sweet, and the ethical credentials of the company are hard to beat. A good choice for the concerned chocolate connoisseur.

review/summary: Allergy Information
review/text: Upon receiving a package of 12 bars, I noticed on the back of the one of the individual wrappers "Allergy Information:  Manufactured on shared equipment with products containing milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts, and other nuts."  Nowhere on Amazon nor Theo's website is this found (at least in the 15-20 minutes I spent looking).<br /><br />I have not tried the chocolate because I have Celiac disease so I cannot comment on the quality of the product.  I just wanted to save people some time.

review/summary: Good for you and the planet, maybe, but tastewise, not so much
review/text: If you like your chocolate dark, rich, melt-in-your-mouth and creamy, this is not your bar. The texture was too solid, not at all melty, zero creaminess, and the chocolate itself had an odd off flavor that took me a while to figure out - it was acidic, very much so. This is chocolate in its most natural, healthy, and sadly, least tasty form.  If you are eating this for health purposes, it's the right one, but there are a thousand better tasting chocolates out there.  It's a shame since I really wanted to like this, but those European confectioners that have been tweaking chocolate for the last couple of hundred years, they knew what they were doing.

review/summary: Beefeaters� Chicken Liver Freeze Dried Treats for Dogs
review/text: Would have rated no star if available.  Beefeaters� Chicken Liver Freeze Dried Treats for Dogs, are a product of China, and irradiated "for your protection" according to the company's hold message.  Called Amazon.com customer service, and requested a full refund with pre-paid returned shipping.  Too bad none of this is in the product description.  Amazon CSR was very helpful, and very cooperative, postage paid shipping label received via email immediately.  Thank you, Amazon.com!

These treats take the cake and run. OMG all cats/ clients cats love these treats. They are the onlything i will ever use for training again. Best cat treat on the market. just dont forget to cut them up in little pieces there to big for your average house cat.<br /><br />If you have a finiky cat that dosnt like to eat. well here is your god send. Just crush some up and toss there food in it. Its a garanteed way to get them to start eating again. Dont use a ton since its high in fat.

review/summary: Hibiscus
review/text: The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey.<br /><br />I love Tazo Teas and have been immersing myself in the mysterious experience with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried most of the flavors and have always been impressed.<br /><br />I do think you need two tea bags for each cup of tea to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients. Caffeine Free.<br /><br />You can drink this as you type into the night...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Not Entirely Satisfied
review/text: Even though the shipping was super fast, it was not as good as I hoped it would be. I'm pretty sure I only received a pound and a half - definitely not the full two pounds - which I guess is fine because I don't see myself finishing what I was given. The flavor itself was decent but no where near as good as dried papaya can be. It didn't seem all that fresh, either. I probably wont be reordering this item again.

review/text: I am ordering my second bag. I like the flavor, and you can't find papaya for cheaper, so it's a good value. There is probably room for improvement in the taste department, but I really like it and that's all that matters. I buy it to share with my bunnies instead of buying the $4-$6 4oz bags when it is the same thing. They also love it :)
