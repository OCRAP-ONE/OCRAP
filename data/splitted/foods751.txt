review/summary: Beware - high fructose corn syrup!
review/text: The above delightful reviews are sadly recalling a different product. The Lea & Perrins that is sold in the US now uses high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar (which is what is still in the UK version.) This may not matter to some but it definitely detracts from the authentic clean spicy taste by making it more sickly sweet which the original is not. It really becomes apparent in Bloody Mary's and also in scrambled eggs or toasted cheese (Welsh Rarebit.) Bring a bottle back from the UK and compare the difference. A pity because it must mean only a cent or so difference in the manufacturing cost.

review/summary: Lea & Perrins in Name Only
review/text: Frankly, this isn't worth the bottle it's put in. Heinz have really screwed the pooch on a wonderful, traditional product. Not only were the sugars replaced by HFCS, but the wonderful malt vinegar has been substituted with a more generic (read: cheaper) distilled vinegar. These two things alone result in a product that not only lacks the subtlety and spice of the original, but one that leaves a nasty, cloying aftertaste. I'n not even going to get into the potential health risks of HFCS--if the stuff tasted good, I probably wouldn't care, considering the small amount used. But, it does NOT taste good, and as a life-long Lea & Perrins devotee, I feel completely ripped off by Heinz's cost-cutting measures. Maybe some people can't tell the difference, but I'm betting a lot more can.<br /><br />My question to Heinz would be, why the hell buy a company, just to completely ruin up its flagship product? Or, is it that they didn't want competition for their third-rate "Worcestershire sauce?" Now that I think about it, the new L&P tastes a lot like the rubbish in the Heinz bottle. Maybe one and the same? Gak.<br /><br />Fortunately, as others have mentioned, you can still get something that more closely resembles the real thing from both Europe and Canada. Do your homework. It's worth the couple extra pence to get the real thing.

review/summary: Not the real product we knew as kids
review/text: The american and european (UK, Canada, etc) market products are very different. Heinz messed things up for us americans by replacing genuine sugar and molasses with "high fructose corn syrup" which leaves aslippery gumminess on the tongue and a basically slimy aftertaste. The "other" (UK, Canada)sauce is clean, sharp with distinct flavor layers and a beautiful, long-lasting aftertaste. Sorry. I order my product from Canada for the same cost, and hope Amazon soon offers the "foreign" product.

review/summary: ITS GOT HIGH FRUCTOSE, RUN FOR THE HILLS!!!!!
review/text: First of all, this L&P Worcestershire does NOT have high fructose corn syrup<br />anymore, the company actually listened to their customers and made the switch<br />back to sugar. As if anybody could tell the difference between the two, very<br />sophisticated taste buds at work here. LOL<br /><br />Second, this HFCS scare is just like any other of these silly food alerts that<br />began about the same time the internet sprang up....not to be taken seriously,<br />everything in moderation right.<br /><br />Anyway, in spite of all these silly negative "reviews" (which are nothing but a<br />personal political statement and not about the product), this is still the best<br />and the only REAL Worcestershire Sauce on the market. Hell, a Bloody Mary is not<br />even a Bloody Mary without L&P, and its perfect for making BBQ sauce, in chili,<br />roasts, and dozens of other uses that will accept no other substitute. 5 stars<br />for this great staple, one pitiful star for all the frightened and brainwashed<br />consumers leaving these idiotic reviews.

review/summary: "Original"? Hardly
review/text: The true "original" is the UK version, which contains malt vinegar and spirit vinegar. This product is the US version, which contains distilled white vinegar instead. I've compared both versions side by side and found that it's even possible to _smell_ the difference. As you may well imagine, the difference in taste is considerable.<br /><br />Please note that this issue is entirely separate from the matter of the high-fructose corn syrup mentioned in so many other reviews. The US version no longer contains HFCS, but it's still not the "original" -- and it's not as pungent and strongly flavored as the true UK original.<br /><br />Use the UK version (with the orange label) and accept no substitutes. Especially when they lie and claim to be "original."

review/summary: Not at all the same product I'm used to- VISIBLE DIFFERENCE
review/text: I'm not sure how much the HFCS had to do with the difference- or the difference in vinegar.. but one thing is for certain, it tastes different from what I remember growing up. And I can confirm the difference visually. The test of Lea & Perrins is to take a white plate and put enough of the sauce to just cover the surface of the plate. It used to be a dark color, now it's a light tan color. WHAT IS THIS? It no longer has the tangy bold flavor, and instead tastes like a watered down version of its former self. I find myself piling on twice as much to try to bring back the old flavor, but never quite getting it. What happened to you lea and perrins? I miss you!<br /><br />I'm going to buy the direct UK stuff and see if it's good.

review/summary: NOT the "Original" - this has HFCS in it.
review/text: As other reviewers have noted, this version of Lea & Perrins' "original" Worcestershire sauce is far from the traditional recipe that's been used since 1838. As mentioned in the product description above, this product contains high fructose corn syrup. I hear Heinz has finally gone back to using sugar in the recipe this year (see the ingredients listing for the US version on the L&P website), but unless and until this product information is updated, I'll assume what's being sold here is old inventory containing HFCS. If in doubt, stick with the bottles with orange labels if you can find them - that is the imported British Worcestershire sauce, and will most definitely be HFCS-free.<br /><br />Good on Heinz for listening to the opinions of their customers, though!

review/summary: The One and Only Worcestershire Sauce Used by My Family for Generations
review/text: When I grew up in south Mississippi, we did not have all the seasonings I use now that I have become a Louisiana spice mouth.  We simply had the basics -- salt, pepper, a little sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, lemon juice, garlic, ketchup, mustard, homemade pepper sauce, and Lea & Perrins�. For us bought sauce in a bottle was only Lea & Perrins�.  Nothing else could be substituted. Less expensive brands never tasted quite right to us.<br /><br />We lovingly placed that bottle with its brown paper cover on the cabinet shelf.  I suppose it would have been fine to remove the paper, but with reverence we kept our "wooster" covered.<br /><br />On the special occasions when we ate grilled steak, we thought there was only one steak sauce - Lea & Perrins�.  I have no reason to promote this product.  My comments are not in any way solicited.  I simply want to tell you what tastes good.<br /><br />When I married at a young age, my mother-in-law, Mary, led me into a new adventure of cooking and tasting the wonderful flavors of food.  She cooked the best okra and tomatoes in the world.  Like my family, she could use only one brand of Worcestershire sauce.<br /><br />Mom's Okra And Tomatoes<br />2 medium onions<br />Some olive oil<br />16 ounces frozen sliced okra<br />2 small cans or 1 large can tomatoes<br />2-3 teaspoons Lea & Perrins� Worchestershire sauce<br />� cup Heinz� ketchup<br />1 teaspoon sugar or equivalent amount of sugar substitute<br />2 teaspoons vinegar<br />Seasoned salt<br />Black pepper<br />Crushed red pepper<br /><br />Chop the onions into big chunks. Saut&eacute; them in a little olive oil. If the tomatoes are whole, slice them. Add the tomatoes, okra, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, sugar, and vinegar to the onions and olive oil.<br /><br />Bring the mix to a boil and season to taste with seasoned salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. Don't add extra sugar, which would ruin the taste; do add extra ketchup if you need it.<br /><br />Simmer the mixture until the okra is cooked enough. It should be firm, not mushy. Check the seasoning and add more as needed, but don't get started eating it. You won't have enough to serve.<br /><br />NOTE:  This recipe is copied from my cookbook, Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook

review/summary: High fructose corn syrup
review/text: I had always bought Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce because I thought it was the original and the best.  Unfortunately, upon reading the ingredients label, I noticed that Lea & Perrins uses high fructose corn syrup.  I seriously doubt that HFCS was part of the original recipe.  I know a lot of people say that HFCS is no different than sugar, but I disagree for two reasons.  First, HFCS is made through a chemical process.  Second, I, like many people, am fructose intolerant.  Some studies show that fructose intolerance is just as common as lactose intolerance.  I can handle a normal amount of natural fructose, but the additional fructose in processed foods leads to digestive problems.<br /><br />Is it really worth tarnishing the reputation of this classic product by using HFCS?  How much does this actually save per bottle?  I bet less than a penny.  If they are willing to cut corners on this ingredient, how can the rest of the ingredients be trusted?<br /><br />Because of Lea & Perrins cost cutting, I have switched to French's Worcestershire Sauce.  They use molasses and regular corn syrup, not HFCS.

review/summary: Signals Whiffle Ball Games Are Over and Dinner Begins
review/text: My name never carried well across the neighborhood to the yard where I most often struck out at the plate. Sound, as is the case with many a young boy, was only one way to call me.<br /><br />Misty evenings, just as the sun committed to drop westward, an hour after my father would drive up in his Buick Special, I smelled Worcestershire sauce from our charcoal Webber. This meant the Whiffle ball game ended, and, win or lose, I had a different plate to step up to.<br /><br />The scent created a state of emergency. Bats, balls, and, if we used any, bases were gathered by their respective owners, and we all ran home like lovers impassioned in lustful want.<br /><br />His recipe for steak was simple. Get it from Jerry, a butcher he knew for years, dazzle it with ground pepper and the smallest sprinkle of Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce. Like smoke signals, the air became the messenger, or, for me, a siren seducing me homeward. No other sauce would do. His reasons had no merit for me at six years old, but I never had cause to question.<br /><br />Such as it will be for you. Big bottles of Worcestershire sauce will be what you need, but a small bottle will be inspiration enough.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/text: Flavor wise, these are merely ok.  There is nothing great here.  In fact, these bars taste generic and slightly cheap to be honest.  I actually found the peanut butter flavor to be the predominant flavor, overpowering the chocolate, so apparently my taste is different than ShannonAnna, who said that she couldn't taste the peanut butter at all.  Either way, the flavor of the actual rolled oats themselves is a tad bland and chalky almost.  The chocolate underbelly isn't that rich either.  All in all, these are decent but underwhelming, and their size is pretty small, so they aren't all that filling either.  I am very calorie conscious as of late, and so I excited to have a low calorie snack to munch on, but once this box is through I don't see myself buying another.

review/summary: Good, but not outstanding
review/text: My five-year-old daughter shouted "delicious!" upon her first bite and loved the amount of chocolate on the bottom side of the bar. Perhaps that led me to expect too much since I hadn't taken a bite yet, but I felt like this was just okay. I think the title "chocolatey peanut butter" is misleading; while peanut butter chips were on the bar, they were too few. I could barely taste the peanut butter, only noticing a hint. My husband, who loved peanut butter, was disappointed too.<br /><br />The description on the box of "chewy" is accurate, almost to a fault. The thickness of the bar - with rolled oats second on the ingredients list and rice not too much farther down - made chewing go on and on, without much flavor throughout. Most of the chocolate and peanut butter chips are on the outside; the chewing would have been fine if the flavor lasted all the way through the bar and not just on the exterior.<br /><br />All in all, they were fine. They just weren't great.

review/summary: Good midday snack at work- only 5 bars in a box
review/text: What can one say when reviewing a granola bar...yummy! I really like these Special K granola bars. I like to take them to work with me to eat for a midday snack when my energy is starting to wind down. I hate to eat a big lunch at work as it makes me want to nap, but, if I eat one of these I feel like a get a bit of an energy boost.<br /><br />I'm not one that looks at the nutrientional aspects of food but, these are supposed to have 4 grams of protein and fiber. So, I guess that's not too bad. The only thing is because of this granola's small size, it will be tempting to have more then one!<br /><br />Though, I did notice that just one small bar has 7 grams of sugar. I'm no nutrition expert, but, to me that seems like a lot. Also, there's only 5 bars in one box, not the usual 6 as most other snack bars of this type, which seems a bit on the stingy side.<br /><br />Above all, they do taste good and I like them. Great midday snack, if you can only eat one!

review/summary: Appropriately uninteresting review
review/text: ***<br /><br />It's a struggle to devise a way to review this product in a way that makes it interesting to read.  The bars are as advertised (although they were smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Cocoa shows up pretty far down the list of ingredients, although it's difficult to tell exactly how far because there's a mistake in that list, which is that there's an opening parenthesis with no closing parenthesis.<br /><br />Not very interesting so far, right?<br /><br />Well, OK, I can also tell you that when I fully opened up one of the Mylar pouches and laid it on the floor, my cat did eventually lick off the teeny amounts of chocolate that were stuck to it.  He's named Bently Geene because he was born with a tail that's permanently bent into a Z shape, but while that's mildly interesting it has nothing to do with Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Chocolate and Peanut Butter, 4.76-Ounce (Pack of 6).<br /><br />I guess what I'm getting at is that this product just isn't all that interesting.  It doesn't disappoint, but it doesn't surprise.  The tastes and textures are acceptable but no more.<br /><br />As has become my practice in Vine reviews, I have tested whether this product performs well in uses for which it was not intended.  As an example, if you spin up one of these bars in a food processor and rub the resulting substance deeply into both sides of your $10 rib-eye steak before searing it, you'll have wasted one otherwise perfectly good $10 rib-eye steak, not to mention one 60% perfect granola bar.<br /><br />And you know how when you want to mark your place in a book you can either dog-ear the page, which I was taught in grade school never to do, or insert a bookmark?  Well, you CAN use one of these bars as a bookmark, but according to a rather stern email I received yesterday from the people at the Johnson County Library you shouldn't.<br /><br />And you know how sometimes in jail you don't have any cigarettes to trade?  Well, according to my experience I calculate these bars to be worth approximately five cigarettes each.  I don't know how other granola bars compare.<br /><br />Finally, if you find yourself training my dog, PheyeG'hdeaux, (pronounced Fido, of course) in the finer points of Fetch, you should use something like a tennis ball or a plush toy.  I don't know about your dog, but with mine if you throw a little chunk of Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Chocolate and Peanut Butter, 4.76-Ounce (Pack of 6) and say, "Fetch," he will perform the first half of the procedure perfectly correctly every time, which is to run up to the object to be fetched and take it in his mouth.  Where he falls down EVERY SINGLE TIME SO FAR with these granola bar chunks is in the second half of the procedure, which is where he's supposed to run back to me and deliver the fetched object.  What he does with a tennis ball is just that: He returns it to me in his mouth.  But what he does with chunks of granola bar is to eat them up right there on the spot, which is pretty much the opposite of what I'm shooting for.  Now, your idea of Fetch might be different from mine, but as I see it it's really the second half of the procedure that makes the first half make sense.  Well, anyway, you might regard PheyeG'hdeaux's behavior as an endorsement of these bars' taste, but what we're talking about here is a dog that, if given the chance, will happily eat Bently Geene's poop.<br /><br />On that note I give three stars.<br /><br />***

review/text: This granola bar tastes pretty good, but it is tiny - you will still feel hungry about 5-10 minutes after eating it.  It's not too hard, nor is it too soft - the granola pieces actually have the texture of rice krispes.  While the bar is advertised as having a "chocolatey peanut butter" taste, to me it tasted like chocolate with a hint of coffee flavor.  Overall, I liked it.<br /><br />There are 2g of saturated fat in each bar which comprise 23% of the bars 110 calories, which seems a little high.  You also get 4g of fiber, or 16% of the recommended daily values so you may not want to eat too many of these in one day!

Deceptive little packages. It tasted like sweet bland health food, and also had a synthetic quality about it. My Fiance and I shared a bar, and did not want to go back for seconds.

review/summary: Hardly any different than dark chocolate variety
review/text: Crunchy-crisp at the same time chewy. For most food that's a sin. That usually is a signal to run from high fat, salt, calories, and sweetness.<br />Bottom line, it's as reasonably healthy as any similar snack, even those put out by the diet conglomerates that charge weekly, monthly, and per package fees.<br /><br />Nutrition for one 27g bar<br />Cal 110; Cal from Fat 25; Total fat 3g; Sat Fat 2g; 0 trans and polyunsat fat; chol 0; sodium 85mg; Total Carb 17g; Dietary fiber 4g; Sugars 7g; Protein 4g<br /><br />My preference is the dark chocolate which reduces the saturated fat by 25%. Every little bit helps. Less fat sticking to the roof of your mouth.  :)<br />It is a satisfying snack for me, a two heart attack survivor on a controlled diet and joining my wife in trying to eat healthy, exercise, and enjoy life fully.

review/summary: Tasty but small portion
review/text: Delicious. The Special K granola bars have a very delightful bite not too crunchy, not too soft. They have just the right amount of chewiness and most importantly they are very tasty. The peanut butter flavor is not over powering and is accompanied by a chocolate coating on the bottom. They boast only 110 calories per bar, but the bars are small, measuring about 3 inches by 1 inch. The size and taste left me wanting more, so I had a second, which of course put the calories up to 220 for a snack. I would prefer the bars to be about 50% bigger which would be a more reasonable size (in my opinion).<br /><br />Bottom line, they are very tasty and I certainly recommend them. I enjoyed them sufficiently to give them 5 stars.

review/summary: Yummy, especially if you like peanut butter and chocolate
review/text: These granola bars have a smooth blend of peanut butter and chocolate with crispy cereal. More specifically, they have peanut butter on the bottom, cereal in the middle, and chocolate chunks on the top. They are similar to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DHNJE2">Special K Bars, Chocolatey Pretzel, 6-Count Bars Net Wt 4.6 Oz  (Pack of 6)</a>, which have been on the market for awhile. They are a home run and definitely worth a taste. However, they are slightly higher in calories and fat compared to the other cereal bars (e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZ7HQQ">Special K Bars, Chocolatey Drizzle, 12-Count Bars (Pack of 3)</a>).

review/summary: Tasty Snack Bar
review/text: The Kelloigg's Special K Granola Bar, Chocolate and Peanut Butter, is a tasty, albeit kind of small bar. I didn't find it filling enough to serve as a meal replacement. The ingredients are not geared for someone watching their carb intake, but if you're looking for something that tastes good for a snack or portable 'meal' and you find this is enough for you, it would work pretty well. These bars have a very nice flavor, with the peanut butter and chocolate and are enjoyable, but personally I'd like something a bit more filling.

review/text: Every kid who has tried these bars absolutely love them and no wonder - they are not "special" as in "healthy" by any stretch of the imagination.  They are full of sugar and other non-nutritional ingredients. They also do not provide much in the way of sustenance for very long. I would give these 5 stars for the kid approval and 2 stars for the nutrional value but only a 3 for value.

review/summary: Tasty though not fulfilling
review/text: The chocolate enad peanut butter flavor of these granola bars were pretty tasty for snacks early in the morning. Using as a substitute for breakfest on those fast days when one has no time to fix them was actually pretty convenient. I enjoyed their taste and they made me feel good and feel healthier than when I eat a sugary heated pastry from the toaster.<br /><br />Only thing I wish was that they were a bit larger of sorts. Just two hours after eating them I definitely had to break into my lunch stash or find another snack, though ignoring that they were all around good, definitely get some.

review/text: If you're familiar with Special K bars, this one will come as no shock--the texture, the taste, etc. are exactly what you'd expect. Which, in some odd, backhanded way, makes the comfort food, I guess. There's no mold-breaking going on here, which will keep existing fans happy, but probably won't win Special K any new fans. Not that this is a bad thing in any way. ***

review/summary: Decent breakfast bar
review/text: This review is for the Kellogg's Special K granola bar chocolatey peanut butter flavor. The package highlights the 4g fiber and 4g protein with "3g fat per serving" in smaller letters on the package. When compared to a local organic product from my area, the Special K version has 110 cal vs. 140 and the 4g fiber vs. 1g along with other vitamins that are not in significant amounts in the compared brand.<br /><br />The bar itself is granola with small peanut butter chips with a bottom layer of chocolate. The taste is about average compared with other similar chewy granola bars, but definitely a tasty office mid-morning snack, good for day trips, kid snacks, etc.<br /><br />Nutrition: 4 out of five; Taste: 3 out of five; Convenience: 4 out of five.

review/text: Now i can honestly say these bars are better than i thought they would be. You get the chocolate and then the little bits of peanut butter with the granola. I actually went and bought more of these. They are great for on the go. i keep one in my purse just in case and i keep a few extra at work. Overall not a bad snack, not a meal replacement, although i have done that before. sometimes a situation just cant be helped. Im not a huge fan of chocolate so the fact that it wasnt overpowering was a bonus for me.

review/text: I like that these granola bars are packed with 4 gram of fiber and 4 grams of protein. At 110 calories per bar, it's a guilt free treat! The granola bars have a nice blend of chocolate and peanut butter, which helps curb cravings. The bars are made of  granola mixed with peanut butter chips, dipped in and drizzled with chocolate. However, the bars are just a tad dry and feel a bit gritty. Would definitely taste better with a tall glass of milk.

If you're looking for a super healthy snack, then move on, but if you want a decadent treat that you don't feel TOO guilty about, then you've found your bar. A soft, chewy and very sweet granola snack that the whole family will enjoy, very similar to Kudos.<br /><br />It's a great replacement for a chocolate bar with less of all the stuff that's bad for you. I will buy this product for sure, and probably try other flavors.

Blush, blush is my sarcasm showing?  Be careful too when you check out the price of these little (and I do mean tiny)barettes.  At $3.77 each you may find this product gets stuck in your throat.

review/summary: Soft, Chewy, tastes like a candy bar
review/text: The Special K Granola Bars are quite tasty.  They are .95 oz. which translates into a bar 3.25" long and just over 1" wide.  They are on the small side, but are still slightly larger than Quaker Chewy Granola Bars.  It may be their small size that accounts for the low calorie count because they taste really good, not at all like a diet granola bar.<br /><br />They are considerably more expensive than Quaker chewy granola bars, however.  A package of 30 costs $22 (.75 ea) while a package of 48 Quaker bars costs $16 (.35 ea).  I do think the Special K bars taste a little better and are chewier.<br /><br />I do recommend this product.

review/text: I love chocolate.  I love peanut butter.  And I love granola bars.<br /><br />So Special K Granola Bars, Chocolate and Peanut Butter sounded like a must-try.<br /><br />These bars consist of a chocolate layer on the bottom, with the chewy granola layer making up the middle.  On top are mini chocolate and peanut butter chips, and some drizzled chocolate.<br /><br />I appreciate that this has 4g of fiber and 4g of protein.  The taste is good.  Not yummy enough that I'm going to want to eat it like a candy bar, but still something I am happy to eat as a quick breakfast on the run, or a bit of an afternoon snack.

review/text: I usually veer away from granola bars because they are too 'tough' to eat or they are too chewy.<br /><br />These were neither.<br /><br />I liked the modest size and big flavor. Also, they were simple enough for even my 27mo son to break apart and eat...and he gobbled up the majority of the bars.<br /><br />I was surprised by how much I liked them, really.<br /><br />The only down side I can think of is that with summer here the chocolate and peanut butter chips will get too gooey. I have that issue with other bars and it makes for a mess.<br /><br />Aside from that, a tasty snack.

review/text: ...then you'll like these Special K Granola bars. Same chewy consistency, same sweetness. The flavors of chocolate and peanut butter are in there, but not in a strong way (I'd have liked more peanut butter). While "granola" is a very generic term these days, I'd also have liked to have a bit more crunch in the mix. And there's a slightly powdery aftertaste (not particularly unpleasant) which seems common with protein-added snack bars.<br /><br />I found this tasty with coffee, but couldn't really give it higher than average marks as there's just nothing particularly exceptional going on here. But if you're looking for a low-ish calorie snack with decent fiber and protein, you could do worse than keeping a box of these in a desk drawer.

review/summary: Not my first choice for a low calorie snack
review/text: At first glance, Kellogg's Chocolatey (NOT Chocolate) and peanut butter Special K Granola Bar would appear to be a tempting low calorie snack. It's only a 2 points value (WW points plus), but that's where the benefits end. The bar is quite small, smaller than other chewy granola bars, and the taste and texture leave something to be desired.<br /><br />I found the taste to be somewhat artificial, and the texture dry and chalky. I'm guessing that the label reads "Chocolatey" because there aren't the right proportion of ingredients (i.e. cocoa butter) to legitimately call it actual Chocolate (despite Amazon's title/labeling).<br /><br />For a low calorie granola bar, I prefer Trader Joe's high fiber Chocolate Chip bar. It's 3 points plus value, a larger bar, and better tasting. It's also available in peanut butter.

review/summary: They're OK but not the healthiest of the lot
review/text: The Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Chocolate and Peanut Butter, is an OK snack bar (hence the 4 stars). With 4g of fiber and 4g of protein per bar, it is a good snack to tide you over those hunger binges. This is expecially true for those who are trying to lose weight or maintain their present weight. At its size and 17g of total carbs per bar, it is a great source of energy prior to working out. What I dislike about this snack bar is the Saturated Fat and Sugar contents, at 2g and 7g respectively per bar. I try to shy away from food that contains any amount of Sat. Fat beyond 10% and Sugar contents beyond 3g per serving to control both fat and sugar intakes. Eating beyond 3 bars and this snack bar seemed on the unhealthy side. They do taste great however, a unique blend of chocolate and peanut butter. Just don't try overdoing it.

review/text: This is more like 3.5 stars - the chocolate comes through very nicely, but it's not the strongest peanut butter flavor out there if you're a serious peanut butter lover.  Still, these are tasty bars, considering that they're 100 calories and mostly granola (and chewy at that, they give your jaw a bit of a work out but they're not hard).  But they help with any sweet cravings you might have, they take a minute or two to eat and they do hit the spot, staving off the hunger pangs for a bit.  So they seem to do what they're intended to do.

review/summary: Average, small, not very peanut buttery
review/text: I thought these tasted pretty good, but there's not very much to them. Plus the peanut buttery taste wasn't very strong. The peanut butter is just in small peanut butter chips (they look like tiny chocolate chips).<br /><br />These bars are also small, and there aren't a lot of these in each box. There are 5 in each box, and there are 6 boxes in this item. So, there are only 30 bars in this item, which doesn't seem like a lot.<br /><br />The bars are pretty small, so doing the math of a 27 gram bar times 30 bars, you only get about 1.75 pounds total of food. I usually prefer quantity to quality, so I think in the future, I'll just get a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0A8XQ">Special K Cereal</a>, put a dollop of peanut butter on it, drizzle a bit of chocolate, get the same product, and save a bundle.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Pretty good in the category of about 100 calorie snacks<br />+The packaging makes it look like there's a lot more product than there actually is<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Small bars<br />-Left me hungry<br />-I could eat two boxes in one sitting, and still be hungry<br />-Tiny peanut buttery chips, so not much peanut butter<br />-Too little value for the small amount of food in this product<br /><br />Nutritional info:<br />*110 calories<br />*3g fat<br />*17g carbohydrate (7g of sugars and 4g of fiber)<br />*4g protein

review/summary: Greatly loved at our house!
review/text: We are fans of the Special K bars in general at our house. We like several of the varieties including the lower calorie ones. These had a great taste, sweet but not super sweet, and were a decent size for what I expected. You can definitely taste the peanut butter but it does not overwhelm the chocolate. I found them very satisfying as a light afternoon snack at work with some tea.

review/text: These were my first experience with Special K granola bars and my overall thought was MEH. They are tasty, but not very filling. I like my granola bars to have some heft to them, but these are so light and airy--and only about 3-4 bites worth at that--that I wasn't impressed. I guess they'd be good for on the go in case you were starving and wanted a tiny snack, but otherwise I'd skip them and go for something a bit more substantial.

review/summary: Good but Not Better
review/text: These granola bars with peanut butter mini-chips, a drizzle of chocolate over the grain, and a bottom layer of chocolate taste good.  It is a touch sweet and the chocolate isn't very strong compared to the peanut butter flavor but it has a good amount of whole grains and those are decently crunchy but not hard.  Nutritionally they are good, too, with an acceptable amount of fiber, protein, sugar, and calories for this type of product.<br /><br />But this is not better than several other cereal, fiber, or granola bars I've tried in the past.<br /><br />It could easily have more fiber in it or even less sugar so why it does not, I'm sure especially when this is part of the Special K family that promotes itself as a good way to lose weight.  These could do this and still have more chocolate, too.  Look at the Fiber Plus bars or the Fiber One bars for an example of a better product.<br /><br />This is certainly better than grabbing a plain granola bar or a candy bar but it does not meet the nutritional vales or the taste values of other similar bars.

review/summary: Kudos to Special K!
review/text: Kellogg's Special K Granola bars, Chocolate & Peanut Butter are a nice treat sans guilt.  With only 3 grams of fat, 110 calories and 7 sugars you can enjoy a tasty, semi-decadent snack without torpedoing your diet.  The thin layer of chocolate on the bottom tricks your tongue into thinking it's getting a solid chocolate candy bar while the drizzle of chocolate on top visually furthers the illusion.  In between is a chewy, Rice Krispie-like bar sprinkled with peanut butter flavored chips to complete the package.  As a bonus you get 4 grams each of protein and fiber.  I can't say that I'd pay $$$ to have these shipped to my house but it's a safe bet I'll stock up on them when they go on sale at my local store.

review/summary: Standard stuff, but delish!
review/text: When going for granola bars (assuming they are a healthier snack choice, though I really don't know), I do tend to prefer the chewy, chocolate chip or peanut butter/chocolate chip varieties, so I have tried others (Quaker is the only brand name that immediately comes to mind). These Kellogg's Special K bars don't strike me as anything different. They're delicious, soft/chewy granola bars with a chocolate coating on the bottom and drizzling on top, and peanut butter chips throughout. I like that the peanut butter and chocolate don't really overpower each other in MY opinion, and they make for a great, sweet treat with 4g fiber and 4g protein, 110 calories, 2g sat fat, 85mg sodium, and 7g sugar (just the info on the FRONT of the box, there's plenty more on the side). Upon a satisfactory price comparison, I'd gladly buy these, though I can't say they are better than the other brands out there. Maybe if I were trying them side by side. I think they're overall pretty standard/what you would expect, but that's not a bad thing at all. I wish there were more in the box, ha. Actually, I'm a bit confused. I received a box with "5 Chewy Bars", not 6. I don't know if that's because it is for reviewers or what. It still claims to be the 4.76 oz package though.

review/summary: It was just okay treat
review/text: I have to agree with some other reviewers - peanut butter taste prevails over chocolatey one, that was not a problem for me, I love love love peanut butter taste and even though I love chocolate too, I am okay with peanut butter being a stronger one. My main issue was that it just was not a particularly tasty or filling bar overall. I think the phrase "it was just okay" characterizes this one perfectly. Not horrible, but not my first choice if I were buying and choosing amongst the bars of different varieties. I was also hungry after less than an hour. Of course I did not expect it to fill me for whole day or even half a day, but I was hoping for couple hours.

review/text: To me, these bars are very similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317ES2A">Kellogg's FiberPlus Antioxidant Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars.</a>  Both taste great and are a favorite low calorie snack of ours.  There's a thin layer of chocolate on the bottom, and a little drizzled along the top, along with peanut butter chips as well.  Great little treat if you enjoy chocolate and peanut butter. Most low calorie granola bars are tiny and very unsatisfying.  But these are substantial enough to hit the spot without ruining your next meal or calorie count.  Definitely a favorite of ours. Just wish the box came with 6 instead of 5; makes it easier for 2 people to share.  But then, we usually get the value box which contains 10.  Either way, it's a really yummy low-cal treat.

review/text: This is a tasty and satisfying treat. I don't like bars that are too sweet and this one is about right. Overall the chocolate and peanut butter flavors are subtle without overwhelming each other. I was hoping that they might be a bit less than 110 calories but that might be expecting too much. The bar is about the size of a Snickers bar (but Snickers have 273 calories). Plus they have 4 grams of protein which is pretty good for a bar this size. This bar will work well for an after meal snack and still keep you on track with your diet.

review/text: These bars are nice and chewy and they're not too sweet, which I like. However, while the chocolate flavor was good, I could barely taste the peanut butter.  At only 110 calories per bar, they're a nice afternoon snack to hold you till dinner.  There are five bars per box and the bars themselves are about four inches long and 1/2 an inch thick.  There is a coating of chocolate on the bottom of the bars and what looks like peanut butter chips shot throughout.  When Kellogg's goes back to the drawing board to improve upon the recipe, I suggest more peanut butter flavor.

review/summary: Chocolate and peanut butter can only be so bad...
review/text: Overall I didn't think these were spectacular. But they're chocolate and peanut butter flavored, so even a less-than-spectacular bar in that flavor is pretty good.  Granola bars fall along a spectrum from 'cereal pressed into a bar' at one end to 'pretty much a candy bar' at the other end.  I'd say these fall more toward the 'pretty much a candy bar' end of the spectrum.

review/summary: Good Nutrition and Flavor
review/text: These granola bars are chewy, crunchy, lightly sweet and packed with good stuff your body needs. I didn't notice the peanut butter flavor as strongly as some other bars I've tried,  but I personally didn't mind. I do not notice an after taste. The bars are a bit small, but for a snack or pick-me-up they're perfect.<br /><br />The nutrition facts show 4 grams of fiber and 4 grams of protein in each bar with 3 grams of fat. Note that 2 of the 3 fat grams are saturated fat and there are no trans fats indicated. 110 calories seems reasonable for a snack bar. There are 17 total carbs indicated, with 7g of sugar. It also shows that there is 2% DRV calcium, 2% iron, 8% riboflavin, and 10% each of thiamin, niacin and vitamin B6. It's low in sodium at 85 mg per bar.<br /><br />All the facts aside, the bar tastes good and I intend to incorporate them as my morning snack. I'm hoping that these will help me in my weight loss goals. The protein and fiber keep me full between meals and I like that it's low calories. I've tried Special K bars in other flavors and am glad to have another flavor to enjoy and add variety to my routine. It kinda helps satisfy that chocolate craving too!

review/summary: Excellent Taste, Just Wish the Bar Was Bigger
review/text: First, I must admit I love chocolate and have a hard time resisting a Hershey's bar. I've never been that crazy about granola bars in general. Yes, they're healthier but often I feel I'm eating a handful of mixed nuts frozen in the shape of a candy bar.<br /><br />That said, I absolutely love the taste of this Special K Granola bar. It has just the right balance of chocolate and peanut butter to satisfy my palate. Other chocolate-ly bars I've had in the past (by Luna and Trader Joe's) were sometimes either too sweet, not sweet enough, not crunchy or too crunchy. Here, neither ingredient overwhelms the other and the granola is seamlessly mixed in with both. I like the soft crunch, which releases the delicious aroma of chocolate mixed with peanut butter into your mouth. It reminds me of a "Whatchamacallit" bar, only healthier and without the sticky caramel!<br /><br />My only quibble is that bars seem a bit on the small side, but that's kind of a compliment too - it was so delicious that it was gone in a few bites! I will definitely pick up some more bars in the future.

Clocking in at 110 calories each these bars are a great snack for those of us who are dieting or at least trying to.  They give you all the sweetness that you are craving and are large enough to satisfy you until your next meal.<br /><br />These are going to be a no-brainer for me.

review/summary: Decent, but over valued
review/text: I'm a peanut butter fan, I also like chocolate and have eaten the occasional granola bar at times. So, I jumped at a chance to give these bars a try.<br /><br />The very first thing I noticed is, there are only 5 bars in a box. A curious number. I mean, they could have certainly fit a 6th one into the box. Second thing I noticed is these bars are small. I know they're not intended as a meal, or anything, but honestly 4 bites and it's gone type of small.<br /><br />Third thing, I couldn't taste the peanut butter and there was only a hint of chocolate for me. Just overall bland. Not gross type bland, just very little flavor.<br /><br />Based on Amazon's way of shipping groceries you purchase a 6 pack of boxes. 5 bars per box, equals 30 bars. I'm not sure the price, size, and taste would have me paying that much for the end value.<br /><br />They are alright, but there are so many other options out there already for bars of this type. This is not one I can see myself purchasing anytime in the future.

review/summary: Another Good Product From Kellogg's
review/text: Last year I decided that I wanted to start eating healthier, to deal with some health issues, to get them under control before they became serious, and would be forced to change my diet.<br /><br />One of the ways I have found in part due to thanks to my father who is a borderline diabetic, he does take meds for it, but it does seem to run really high on his side of the family. He taught me what to look for when making wiser food choices.<br /><br />I knew that I wasn't getting enough fiber in my diet, that according to my father that carboyhydrates turn into sugar, which fiber helps to counterbalance that out, and to limit the amount of sugar that I eat.<br /><br />So, now I read every food label if there is one before I make a food purchase.  It does take longer to grocery shop, but in almost a year I have lost 37 pounds, which at least to me is impressive. I know that alot of my weight loss is due to eating healthier, watching what I eat, making healthier food choices.  After awhile of doing this it does become a way of life.  The scale does NOT lie!!<br /><br />So, I started trying various granola bars, and have found that Kellogg's makes my favorite granola bars as well as other healthy snacks that are also low in carbohydrates, high in fiber, and low in sugar.<br /><br />My father told me to limit the amount of carbohydrates I eat in any given product to less than 20 grams, there are 17 grams in these Special K Chocolately Peanut Butter Granola Bars, there are 4 grams of fiber which is 16% of your daily fiber, so these are definitely a good source of fiber, and my father told me to limit my sugars in any given product to less than 10 grams.  These granola bars have 7 grams of sugar.<br /><br />To me they taste almost like a candy bar so that I do not feel deprived.  These particular granola bars are chewy, have a chocolate peanutty taste that is not overwhelming.  They do leave me feeling satisfied, and they also help to control my appetite.<br /><br />The total fat grams are 3 grams, which is only 5% of your daily value.  The amount of saturated fat is 2 grams, which is 10% of your daily value, and 4 grams of protein which is 6% of your daily value.<br /><br />These granola bars have 10 % of thiamin,niacin,and vitamin B6.  Each bar is 110 calories.  The amount of sodium per bar is 85 mg, which is 4% of your daily value.<br /><br />What is helpful is on the front of the box they do spell out on the upper right hand corner of the box how many calories each bar has, as well as how much saturated fat, sodium, and sugars in each bar for quick reference.  The front of the box also shows that there are 4 grams of fiber per bar, which is in a green circle, and 4 grams of protein is in a blue circle.<br /><br />Each box contains 5 granola bars.  I do want to warn you which I have found that most products that do contain a fair amount of fiber in them, they tell you to increase your fiber intake slowly, because if you do eat too much fiber at one time it will cause some intestinal discomfort.<br /><br />Products that are high in fiber do leave you feeling full longer.<br /><br />To me, Kellogg's products have a proven time tested track record quality to them, and they continue to come out with new and healthier products, which is really a plus for those of us who are trying to eat healthier, and making wiser food choices, to have such a wide array of products to choose from.<br /><br />As long as Kellogg's continues to come out with new innovative food products, I will be continue to buy them.<br /><br />They have so many food choices to pick from, you will never get bored or feel deprived, and as an added bonus you will feel healthier too, and lose some weight in the process.<br /><br />To me these Kellogg's Granola Bars are good food choice for everyone, whether you are trying to lose weight or not.

review/summary: My family loved these
review/text: Let me start off with the cons.  This box comes with 5 chewy bars rather than the normal 6 that I get in my Kashi TLC of Cascadian Farm boxes.  I didn't even notice until all the boxes were next to each other.  Next, I compared the nutritional value and these have fewer calories than my other chewy bars.  The Kellogg's bar has 110 compared to 140 from the other bars.  However, the Kellogg's only weigh 27 grams and the others range from 35 grams to 40 grams.  So, of course these will be less calories, there is less of them!<br />Now on to the pros.  The flavor is great.  My kids love eating these with all the chocolate coating (which makes a mess in the hot Vegas days) and the peanut butter chips.  My oldest doesn't even like peanut butter but said she likes it now.  Even my husband snatched the last bar from the box and mentioned how much he liked them.  Now it's time to compare the prices in the grocery store and see which the better deal is.

review/summary: Wow, better than I expected
review/text: I tried a bazillion granola and protein bars and the three things I don't care for are too much sugar, that weird "protein bar" after-taste that kind of resembles to smell of latex gloves (I know, weird analogy, but hopefully you know what I mean, lol), and if it's peanut butter flavor then many of the PB bars have a burnt peanut taste. Yuck. These Special K bars have NONE of those issues! Let's get really technical: these things are really yummy, plain and simple. The granola is the chewy kind and it's just right, Kellogg's did it al dente, won't destroy dental work. The PB flavor is not burnt and just right, not too much. There's only 110 cals per bar so they make a great mid-afternoon snack with a good latte (or in my case, whatever store brand coffee my peers are burning in our kitchenette at work).<br /><br />I've never gotten a food product from the Vine program before but these just caught my eye and I'm glad they did. I'll definitely be buying more. And a decent latte at lunchtime.

review/text: I was pretty much raised on granola bars (Mom was ahead of her time) and as an adult like to have protein or granola bars around for meal substitutes.<br /><br />These bars are smaller than normal granola bars, which accounts for less calories and fat grams, from the get go. To me they tasted sweeter than they should be, and more like eating a bad rice crispy treat. The chocolate drizzle helped with the taste, but not by much, but I really didn't get the peanut butter taste. At all.<br /><br />As to holding back hunger or as a meal substitute. Nope, not gonna happen. There is just not enough substance. Now as a SNACK in between meals, then yes not a bad idea.I'll keep them handy til we go through the box, but probably will not purchase them for continued use.

review/summary: very sweet!
review/text: If you really have a sweet tooth, this is the bar for you! I guess that if I didn't quite want a candy bar I would like this, especially as it's only 110 calories.  I generally prefer more healthy tasting granola bars with more granola, but then they do have more calories as they are more filling, so it's a give and take situation.  I definitely thought that I was eating candy more than a healthier snack. If that's what you like then this is recommended.

review/summary: LOVE these! Tasty little snacks with a dash of fiber
review/text: I normally regard granola as rabbit food. But....this Special K granola bar is paired with chocolate and peanut butter so I had to give it a shot. I am loving these! They taste a little like a candy bar, but are very small so you don't have the sugar overload of a say...a full size chocolate bar. I guess the bonus is the fiber & protein added for an appearance of being health food. They are sweet without being cloying and they have a chewy factor that I enjoy. Not crunchy like other granola products on the market. They are too sweet for my tastes for breakfast, but as a snack in the afternoon or after dinner they are just right. I'll totally buy these again in the future!

review/summary: Not Overly Chocolate Or Peanut Butter Tasting But Good
review/text: Not overly chocolate or peanut buttery but still has a good flavor. It doesn't have an "off" flavor at all like some bars do. Definitely would try again. The kids even liked them.<br /><br />Each bar has 110 calories, 3 g of fat, 17 carbs with 4 g of fiber making them only 13 g net carbs so not a bad snack nutritional wise but not real filling either.

review/text: Trying to lose weight but yet want something to eat?  Then Special K Granola Bars will help fill that need.<br /><br />A small airy snack when all you want to do is eat, this bar will provide you with chocolate and peanut butter that you might be craving.  110 calories and 4 grams each of fiber and protein, this small bar doesn't overload your diet.<br /><br />If you are looking for a heavy, "sink your teeth in" bar, this is not what Special K provides.  It is for someone looking to remove a craving and yet have something that tastes good.

review/text: So you like peanut butter? You like granola? Enjoy a bit of Special K along with that, and want it drizzled in chocolate? Boy, is it ever your lucky day!<br /><br />This box contains six delicious bars of goodness. They are very tasty, with just that right balance of chocolate and peanut butter so that neither overwhelms the other. In fact, I'm straining right now to think of anything bad to say, and the best I can manage is that if you're like me, prone to overeating, you'll probably wolf the whole box at once.<br /><br />But other than that mild bit of negativity, this is one great product!

review/summary: Darned near flavorless
review/text: To me, flavor is important, and that is exactly what these bars lack.  I thought that the combination of chocolate and peanut butter would be delicious.  However, I could barely discern the peanut butter flavor, and could only discern the chocolate flavor to the slightest possible degree. (To be fair, I am a fan of intense dark chocolate, so that may explain why I found the chocolate flavor in this bar to be close to non-existent.)<br /><br />In obtaining these granola bars to evaluate for the Vine program, I was hoping to discover a tasty snack, suitable for taking with me on an upcoming plane trip that will last many hours.  Well, it didn't work out that way.  After eating one of the five bars that I received, I have no interest whatsoever in consuming the rest of them.

review/text: Kellogg's Special K Granola Bars satisfy the sweet-tooth craving; but the contents suggest that this particular granola bar (with 7 grams of sugar, 110 calories in less than an ounce, and low vitamin content) does not provide the level of health benefits which are available in other (albeit less tasty) energy bars.

review/summary: I love these!
review/text: I thought these were very tasty, and I plan on picking some up at my next trip to the grocery store.  I don't know why these got so many bad reviews.  They were chewy, not hard, sweet, but not too sweet, and they have a decent amount of calories.  A lot of bars that you get that have chocolate on them, are about 140 to 150 calories.  These have 110 calories, and are 27 grams, which is pretty much the same size as most bars of this kind.  They don't have high fructose corn syrup, but they do have fructose and corn syrup, so that isn't a good thing.  These aren't natural as they are full of things you can't pronounce.  However, if you are looking for a sweet snack, these beat a candy bar any day.  The only thing I don't care for is that they don't leave me satisfied.  After eating one, I want another.  I find this is true with most chocolate granola bars though.  I agree with the other reviewers, I don't taste the peanut butter, I only taste the chocolate.<br /><br />I like to take these to work for my afternoon break, as that is when I crave a sweet treat, and these are much better than candy, as the calories are considerably lower.

review/summary: More Chocolate Than Peanut Butter
review/text: The Special K Chocolatey Peanut Butter granola bar box has 5 standard sized granola bars (at least the box I got had 5). Upon opening, you'll be hit with a strong scent of chocolate. The appearance of the bar is cris-crossed chocolate drizzled over the bar with peanut butter chips, corn fiber, and oats on top of an 1/8th inch thick solid chocolate bottom.<br /><br />The texture is chewy with the predominant flavor being chocolate. The peanut butter is not really noticeable and is more of an after thought rather than contributing substantially to the taste.<br /><br />One drawback is the presence of hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils for those looking to avoid it. As snacks go, this leans more towards a candy bar than straight up healthy though it does have small amounts of some vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />This granola bar won't change your life but does a decent job as a quick snack.

review/text: And not enough taste to make it worth it. The ingredient list has sugar showing up at #3, and the rest of the ingredients listed didn't sound terribly healthy either. I didn't pick up on much flavor at all except for a sickly sweet chocolate flavoring that was not to my taste at all, although I did pass one bar along to my co-worker and he liked it better than I did. I think it's a matter of personal tastes, as well as dietary concerns - I have to watch sugar, but the younger folks don't.

I could barely taste the peanut butter and the bars had a mealy texture that I didn't enjoy. Maybe it's the fact that I'm not a die-hard chocolate lover, but I would have enjoyed a drizzle of chocolate on top of the bar rather than the hard layer at the bottom.

review/summary: A decent granola bar - a little bland, but filling
review/text: I am a fan of granola bars for quick fixes on the go, and I don't eat full breakfast very often.<br /><br />This does the job in a workmanlike way, and I can say I liked them. Still, it might be more at 3 1/2 stars than a full four.<br /><br />Other reviews thought they were too sweet. I'm on the other side, and I think they're too bland. They don't have any strong taste. They taste fine, but it's not especially memorable. I wouldn't mind a more distinct 'blend.' Like most peanut butter bars I've eaten, they have a bit of a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />But, they are hefty little bars. They aren't tiny like many granola bars and the chocolate/PB mix is pretty filling.<br /><br />They're good. I might not jump through hoops for them, but if you eat granola bars regulary, these could be worth checking out just for a change of pace.<br /><br />If I've done my math correctly, it comes to $.75 a bar - 6 boxes of 5 bars each in a shipment - which I think is a decent price.

review/summary: Cereal Bar in the way of Health Food?
review/text: So are energy bars the new fad of eating? Perhaps taking milk out of the equation has led to people finding other sources of energy besides a bowl of sugared cereals. Companies like Kellogs I am sure had to find some means of "keeping up" by reconstituting their own brands. Special K, perhaps their most popular "healthiest" cereal has come up with this Granola Bar which advertises 4 grams of Fiber and 4 grams of protein. While they advertise the benefits, one should not glare over the fact that this is a "chocolatey peanut butter" bar.<br /><br />A serving size is one (1) bar which is 110 calories. There are 2 grams of saturated fat, 85 miligrams of sodium, and 7 grams of sugar. The number one ingredient is "solluble corn fiber", which to the brief research I checked out, seems to have some health benefits, particularly in digestion. Most of the ingredients should be known to people. Lots of different kinds of oils, which probably are attributed to the fat content. The box says "chocolatety", but there is no actual chocolate in the product, so its a concoction made from other ingredients. For better or worse. Cocoa has risen in cost, so many products that only rely on flavor of chocolate are not using actual chocolate anymore.<br /><br />There is one thing that is confusing for me. The back of the box says "4g of fiber*". So I am looking around for the qualifier this asterisk is referring to. It is not immediately available, but I see underneath the green balloon where it says "4g of fiber" it reads: "3g of total fat". I say confusing because it is above, rather than below, but also because I dont know how fiber relates to fat, unless the most of the fiber comes from the oils. Perhaps others know better.<br /><br />My knee-jerk reaction to this product was that it was just a ploy to ursurp "organic" energy bars, but for what it's worth, this is a tasty and seems relatively nutritious. I dont know all of the negatives of every little ingredient like sorbate 60 or sorbitan monostereate. These ingredients might ward off purists, but for the casual person looking to lighten their snack intake would find this a good supplement.<br /><br />I don't think the product is intended or sold as "health food", but the packaging certainly is on the misleading side, unless one examines it well enough. Even though there is nothing on the product that suggest health outside of its benefits of fiber and protein content, that alone should not be the decision maker. I give this item 3 stars for taste. It is enjoyable. Nothing revolutionary, but tasty nonetheless.

review/summary: Too much fiber flavor
review/text: I like the chocolate and I like the pseudo-peanut butter taste but ultimately a granola bar survives by the quality of the granola. With this granola bar, it feels like the chocolate is merely there to cover up the fact that the granola is possessed of too much natural fiber without the taste that granola should have. It's pretty sub-par granola.<br /><br />These are ok snacks but I like other granola bars better.

review/summary: Decent granola bar
review/text: These are decent Granola bars to give a try-out. There is not much chocolate flavor, to me it seemed more fiber and peanut butter oriented and that's leaves your mouth a dry after-taste.<br />One thing that annoyed me is that some peanut butter drops fall off. Just a pet peeve of mine but wanted to point it out for others like me. Dont see why they couldn't just make it a drizzle like the chocolate or inside the bar.<br /><br />Anyways, overall its got a decent taste and if your in the market for specifically a chocolate and peanut butter Granola bar, you can give this a try-out. Also one thing to consider is these are relatively high in fat for (10% daily sat. fat) and calories (110).

review/text: I love these potato chips.  I've been eating Season's potato chips for years.  When I buy the unsalted ones, I add a little salt on my own.  They're cooked with peanut oil, which doesn't leave the slight aftertaste that many oils other than this and canola oil do, in my experience. These chips have a great mouth 'feel',light and crisp, not too hard or crunchy.  I highly recommend giving them a try.

review/summary: Michael Season's Ripple chips are a hit with wife!
review/text: We first discovered and bought Michael Season's at Fred Meyer because they are reduced fat and salt, and the taste and consistency are great. But FM stocks only Thin and Crispy and my wife wanted a sturdier version to use with dips. After getting product descriptions from the Michael Season's web site we discovered that they also make reduced fat and sodium Ripple chips. Found that Amazon had them in stock, ordered and received them promptly with free shipping. My wife says that she likes the taste as much as the Thin and Crispy and that the Ripple also stand up to using with thick dips.<br /><br />Also we found that Michael Season's are almost entirely whole chips, whether ordered online or bought from a store, unlike Frito-Lay. After I watched a Frito-Lay sales and stock person literally crush each bag of F-L chips apparently so that he could get more bags into the allotted space I could understand why. Michael Season's is a winner for several reasons. And with Amazon, the price per bag is lower than if bought locally.
