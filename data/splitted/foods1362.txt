review/summary: A Caution
review/text: My three dogs really love these treats.  They are made in the USA and reasonably priced.  One word of caution - I use these to stuff a "Waggle" bone and let my Dal go at it.  He loves it, but if he lays down with the Waggle on a light colored rug, the crumbs that fall out will discolor the rug if they get wet.  No big deal as the discoloration seems to wash out just fine.

review/text: We've tried chicken, cheese, and peanut butter. Sometimes the cookies are very small hearts and other times they are large hearts with chunks of oatmeal stuck in them. The smaller cookies are more tender and the large ones are a little harder to break apart. My dog isn't picky, so he's never had problems eating these.

review/text: It's not fair that some people reviewing this item give it such a low rating. You get what you pay for, and then some.<br /><br />.40 an oz.<br />$6.40 a lb.<br /><br />That's all the rating I need. This coffee IS EXCELLENT FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY. Also, low ratings for coffee shouldn't be taken seriously. I have 5 years barista experience and know what coffee should taste like and how to make it well. Most people over or under grind their beans. Play with your grind and measurements. Some don't clean their machines or replace their filters. Some don't store their beans properly. Coffee beans are highly porous and will soak up any odor, you MUST keep them sealed tightly and at room temp. Do NOT wash the container you store your beans in with detergent, only mild fragrance-free soap. At Starbucks we wiped the plastic bean hoppers once a day and washed them once a week. If you search "OXO" in Amazon Warehouse Deals, you might find the perfect container for these beans, I have one already. I suggest the OXO 5 quart.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Square-2-Quart-Storage-Container/dp/B000VJ4560/ref=pd_sim__8<br /><br />Flavor: Mild, low acidic taste, nutty, woody, takes cream and sugar well, smells robust but tastes semi-robust. It is, however, Poor Man's blend, right?  :)

We knew they were not going to be premium beans but when we opened the bag they had little aroma and we thought they tasted like cheap Folgers coffee. We COULD NOT WAIT until the beans were gone and we could place another order for different beans. Might not want to waste your money on these beans...for a few more dollars you can get a really nice roast (Italian or French).

Five pounds last me about a month (yes, for coffee purists who take offense at such things, I do repack and store whatever's not in my "daily brew" cannister chilled, in about 1 pound vacuum packed bags. It really doesn't negatively impact the flavor like some coffee snobs say it does; just let it reacquire ambient temps before burr grinding and brewing). Five pounds last the three coffee drinkers in my family about a month. Works. And it beats the heck out of buying some crappy coffee at Starbucks or whatever both for flavor and cost.

review/summary: Lives Up to It's Name and Then Some
review/text: This blend is not worth $6 per pound!<br />This is my first experience with this roaster and it wasn't a good one. I bought the 5lbs and now I am looking to offload it onto someone.  I just can't afford to do so. It is on par with grocery store brands, but it promises more being from a specialty roaster.  I would expect this taste from 6 month old grocery store ground beans.  I tried 3 different grinds and adjusted brew time.<br /><br />The staff is really friendly and responsive and I want to like this roaster, I just can't buy big batches like this.  It will take some trial and error to find a good bean.  We will see if the roaster can deliver on what they promise.  A good coffee at a decent price.<br /><br />I get this is "Poor Man's Blend", but I wouldn't serve this at a car dealership for free.<br /><br />I am willing to experiment some more and will update my review.  I caution anyone who has become accustomed to high quality beans from buying this.  I asked the roaster what they would recommend for brewing using an AeroPress and they replied saying they never tried using an AeroPress.  How can they not try an AeroPress.  They have exploded in popularity.  I recommended to the roaster that they cup each bean and make recommendations for brewing methods and grinds.

I don't have sophisticated coffee taste like the other reviewers for this coffee but here's my take. Its smooth and mild with a slight hint of columbian coffee body. I fine grind this coffee and use a french coffee press.

review/text: My wife and I were introduced to Coffee Bean Direct Poor Man's blend by our pastor at his home and have been hooked ever since. We of course had to purchase our own grinder and then get the grind just right for our taste and now have progressed to getting a regular supply from Amazon on a monthly basis. We find this to be a little too much for the summer and so need to skip a month now and then but, overall it has been a very good experience and we plan too continue.

review/text: My wife and I purchased an automatic coffee machine and found these beans to be the best.  Not bitter.  Good flavor.  Blonde type of grind with very little, if any, after taste.  Very smooth.  If you want a dark flavor this is not it.  (We found that when given a choice these beans tasted better.  Even so if you want burnt Italian flavor buy Starbucks beans.) So this coffee is what we buy and have it shipped every two months automaticly (saves a few dollars and delivered automatically) .

review/summary: Love Poor Man's Blend Coffee
review/text: I was weary about trying this coffee because of the name of it thinking it was going to be inferior in taste.Boy I was wrong!! I feel I am very picky about coffee beans and have tried many different brands. I always squeeze the bags to see what the aroma is before I buy or use them. Some aromas are just not inticing but this one smells fresh and so yummy. It tastes good too. I will continue to buy the Poor Man's Blend. Getting it on the subscribe and save, using Prime shipping makes this even more of a bargain for 5 pounds of coffee!! I used to regularly buy 2.2 pound bags of a Kona blend fresh roasted beans from one of the big warehouses in town. This saves me money and time getting it through Amazon. Take it from someone who never wants to use ground coffee again, this is a fantastic deal. Written by Renee K.

review/text: I disagree completely with the two previous reviewers !  This tastes exactly like real mayo, and the consistency is just fine, spreads easily.  It's the "fruit spreads" that have a rubbery consistency and cannot be spread.  I solved that problem, however, by dumping the entire jar into my Cuisinart mini chopper.  Just give it a whizz in there, and it comes out the consistency of apple sauce.  I did that with the Apple Butter, and the Apricot spread.  Delicious !

It's not as yummy and does have a slightly different texture. But I'd rather eat a mayo substitute with zero calories than have regular mayo.<br /><br />I mix this with dijon mustard and spread it on sandwiches for a yummy low-cal dijonaise. I haven't tried yet but I think mixing in different spices and seasonings would make a really great spread for sandwiches and other things.

review/text: I have been using the Hellman's light mayo for years and have done just fine. Should have stuck with it. The consistency of this was fine but it tasted like a sweet and tangy miracle whip, which would be fine I guess if I liked miracle whip,  but the after taste was so bad I was literally sick to my stomach while eating this. Considering that there is really a small trace of carbs and calories in this, I think I'll stick to the light mayo which only has 35 calories per serving and less than 1 carb.

I don't know if it can be doctored up to taste better, but i wasn't in the mood for trying it tonight. If I'd paid full price for it, I might be a little upset, but I got it on sale at Sprouts. No foul...hopefully no harm, other than the temporary shock and offense to my taste buds.

If I had other better choices, I probably would have skipped the mayo (based on the Amazon reviews). Thank goodness for Amazon.<br /><br />Stores have Walden farms Products  in different areas. I found some near frozen..in a dietetic section...Some in produce (the salad dressings)...and saw some of the non zero calorie in with the other salad dressings in another store.<br /><br />I wasted half of this GARBAGE trying to recreate a strawberry dip.

review/summary: Great way to get rid of caffeine in your diet.
review/text: I've started using solixir's awaken in the morning as a way to cycle off of coffee and reduce my affinity for the over stimulating energy drinks on the market. The great citrus and crisp, non-sugary taste is an ideal way to start the morning off before a work out. Also, I feel almost guilt free because solixir isn't trying to fool me into thinking that a 20 minute spike in energy followed by a 30 minute coma is the way a healthy energy drink should feel. If you're looking for a great way to feel energized without the jolt/ crash feeling from other energy drinks, very few of which are even natural products, then go with solixir.

review/text: This solixir has the same type of flavor as other energy drinks, so beware if you dont like that yellow fizzy type of drink (almost like red bull but a bit less pungent). I prefer the chamomile version of solixir.

review/summary: Crisp, Cool, and Totally Hydrating
review/text: Solixir is my new favorite beverage!  Each can of solixir is packed with >1,400mg of botanical extracts designed to serve a functional purpose.  The light botanical blend is the perfect balance between juice and sparkling water.  There is no added sugar.  It's all natural.  The Orange Mate, also called "Awaken", is the ultimate beverage for maintaining good hydration and a healthy balance without consuming added sugar and artificial ingredients.  I replaced traditional energy drinks in my diet with the Awaken.  The Awaken only has about as much caffeine as a cup of decaf coffee.  The natural caffeine comes from botanical extracts in the drink.  Goodbye to the jittery feelings and post-buzz crash from traditional energy drinks!  Also check out the Blackberry Chamomile "Relax" and the Pomegranate Ginger "Restore" for a well-rounded selection of functional, healthy beverages.

Yes, these are a bit more substantial, but the taste is almost exactly the same. There is definitely nothing "luxury" about these cookies. I bought these because I loved the Cadbury Oatmeal and Chocolate Chip cookies. Sadly, these did nothing but disappoint.

review/summary: Made in Michigan since 1866
review/text: I like "Vernor's", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is "The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.

This is a nice way to experience 4 different varieties of tea from this premium producer.  All four brew excellent cuppa's.  My favorite is still the English Breakfast tea, big flavor, deep red color and never bitter.

review/summary: Dilmah tea is a delight!
review/text: My husband and I were introduced to Dilmah tea about 10 years ago when a student we hosted from New Zealand brought us a sample package as a gift. We loved it!! I was so excited to find a tea I truly loved that I asked her to please send more when she got home to New Zealand. Ever since, she sends me a couple of boxes as a Christmas gift. For many years, getting Dilmah tea in the US was quite expensive and it was actually cheaper for us to send to NZ and have it shipped here.<br /><br />One of the greatest things about Dilmah tea is that each cup/pot is the same as the last. You always know what flavor you're going to have . . . it doesn't vary from one cup to the next. You get to select your variety by whatever flavor you choose, rather than having each cup/pot (of the same flavor variety)do it for you because the mix of teas is not the same in each bag.<br /><br />I have yet to try the green teas, but bought them as gifts for friends that drink green and herbal teas exclusively. I'm anxious to see how they compare to the black teas.<br /><br />As long as I can get it, Dilmah teas will be on my shelf.

review/summary: Great tuna!!
review/text: This tuna is fantastic! I love tuna in olive oil & it is hard to find sometimes where I live. I bought 3 cases in Chicago at an Italian speciatly store. The olive oil adds nice flavor & I didn't notice much fishy after taste. The tuna is a little drier than the stuff in water  but that is fine by me! I hate a drippy tuna sandwich & I always have that with the water tuna. No matter how long I let it sit in the mesh strainer. With the stuff in olive oil I just spread a little miracle whip on each side of 2 slices of bread & enjoy. One more difference in this tuna is that it has some pretty good chunks of tuna where as the stuff in water is always smooshed. Any way I love this cento tuna! I'm getting ready to eat some now.

review/summary: Good tuna, good value
review/text: I'm giving Cento tuna 5 stars not because it's the best canned tuna I've ever had, but because for its price level, it's very good.  Tuna in olive oil tastes different and has a different texture from tuna in water.  And Cento and Progresso taste different from Starkist in olive oil (the most widely available olive-oil brand).  This is a dense tuna-y can of fish with a pleasant flavor and aroma, most closely resembling Progresso tuna.  It does not have the buttery, delicate-but-intense characteristics of the higher price level (e.g. Ortiz Spanish tuna).  It makes a nice salad Nicoise, French-style sandwich (tuna, vegetables, olive oil pressed in baguette), or better-than-ordinary tunafish salad.<br /><br />Grocery stores in my area emphasize the basic and the inexpensive, and there are no gourmet shops or Italian markets; no one carries this locally.  I buy it when I visit family elsewhere.  There, in a big chain grocery store, it's $2.99/can (5 oz.).  Amazon's price today, as I write this review, is about $2.80/can shipped to your door.  Of course, 24 cans is a lot of tuna even if you eat a lot of tuna, but it's especially a lot if you end up not liking it.  Try it first.

review/text: First of all, after receiving the tuna, I looked on the can to see where it is from and it doesn't say ANYWHERE on the can.  I went online to try to get this information, still nothing.  I hope to God this tuna is not from China.  It doesn't taste like tinned tuna from Italy, which was what I was hoping to get.  Now I have 23 more cans of this tuna which no one in the family even likes.  Would definitely not recommend this brand of tuna.

review/summary: Royal Canin Renal causes dehydration
review/text: This food does provide a reduced protein diet important to dogs that are show kidney values out of range. My dog ate it and liked it, though he would eat anything. Two concerns:<br />1) The amount of food prescribed is way out of line with the amount of food the dog should take in. Says for 50 lbs should be 4.5 cups, and for my 70 lb dog we fed 3 cups per the doctor, supplemented with raw veggies. The dog did not gain or lose any weight on this amount<br />2) We combined the Urinary SO 50/50 with the Renal mix - not sure why they have two. The vet cautioned about how this food will act as a diuretic, that the dog would be very thirsty and recommended we give him distilled water to drink to reduce load on the kidneys.<br /><br />What happened was instantly his poop became hard and smaller than normal. Brought it up to the vet who said this is normal. Dog drank water all the time, and did not exhibit signs of dehydration. What got dehydrated was his poop. He died of peritonitis brought on by a completely full colon because he could not get the very dry stool out of him properly. Very hard to see warning signs - he pooped twice a day, seemed a little distracted, but we had no idea his lower bowel had severly reduced movement. When he threw up undigested food four times in a row (12 hours after eating) the vet said to take him off Meloxicam for a week. Meloxicam is an NSAID arthritis drug known to cause kidney failure and ulcurs, and GI problems (bloody vomit or stools which Mikey did not have as we were watching closely for that). He stopped throwing up but I think it was coincidental timing. All these factors contributed to his death.<br /><br />Long story to say you must measure the water intake while on this food - more than keeping the bowl full. This food is VERY dehydrating. And be mindful of the output of the dog and weeks of very dehydrated poop is something that you should pay close attention to.

One word of warning: the can has a pull tab, but unless you are very strong it's difficult to remove; I recommend using your can opener and forgetting about the pull tab.

I bought five varieties in the 6-pack size and because I am on assignment in a remote location in Alaska and the product is advertised as having an 18 month shelf life. When the package arrived on August 7th, 2012 I was VERY disappointed to discover that all pouches were stamped with a "Best By:" date of September 2012!!  Essentially I was shipped back-stock that was about to expire and I now have 6 weeks to to consume 30 pouches of Indian food before it turns rancid.  Not happy with this purchase!!<br />In summary:<br />5 stars for product: great quality and flavor<br />1 star for seller: boo for passing off your old product on me!
