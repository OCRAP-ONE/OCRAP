review/summary: Jet Fuel ok for dark roast
review/text: I tried Jet Fuel after looking at the reviewed on a number of K-cup roasts. I am a home roaster and new to K-cups because we have a Keurig in the office. I also bought a Solofil reusable K-Cup, which works very well. I was concerned that the so called K-Cup dark roasts would be weak and tasteless. I was wrong, in fact the Jet Fuel is a bit over the top dark and very acidic. I would recommend Emril's Big Easy Bold or a Coffee People French Roast for everyday - Jet Fuel is good for an occasional jolt.

review/summary: K-Cup Switch to Coffee People Jet Fuel Proves OK
review/text: My wife and I purchased Timothy's World Coffee, Parisian Nights, Extra Bold K-Cups for over two years and used Amazon's subscription to automatic shipping for the best economy.  It was disappointing to learn a few weeks ago that this particular coffee would no longer be available on the subscription program.  We looked over the list of coffees that would be available and selected Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups because the label and description included "Dark Extra Bold."  We are very satisfied with the new coffee.  It has the strong, rich flavor and aroma we like.  It is difficult to distinguish this Jet Fuel coffee from our old favorite Parisian Nights.  All of the subscription coffees are in boxes of 50 K-Cups which is a little more economical than the former 24 K-Cup boxes.  This savings plus the discount for subscribing to automatic free shipping results in the lowest cost we have found for these K-Cups.

review/summary: It's OK!
review/text: I was researching different flavors and reviews on K Cups. I came across Jet Fuel which was supposed to be one of the "Boldest" K Cups available. They arrived this morning and I could not wait to try them in my machine. I was quite surprised on how not so "Bold" they tasted!<br />I have tried quite a few other brews and I found the "Jet Fuel" to be the same or less "Bold" than the other ones.<br />I would suggest if you are considering this brand due to its "Bold" flavor that you only purchase a small amount first. I purchased 2- 50 count boxes and sure I will use them but I will still use the other brands that seem to be more "Bold" such as "Expresso Roast" and others.

I have had no experience with that and I've ordered 3 times.

review/text: I listened to a couple of friends that raved about this item.... wrong move. I love a very strong, bold cup of coffee. Increased bitterness is OK, if it is balanced by the flavor. This item isn't it. It was perhaps the most middle of the road, marginal cup I've had in a long time. Little taste, marginally robust, and lots of caffeine. I won't ever buy it again. The Coffee People Black Tiger is a much better product. I also enjoy Emeril's Big Easy Bold....long before this slack waste of time. Save yourself drinking a marginal cup of coffee and try something else.

review/text: In general, I love Coffee People coffee. My only beef with them in general is that I often get coffee grounds in my brewed coffee, and I don't usually have this happen with other brands of K-cups. But it's usually not many; only one or two. My other problem with this particular order was that one of the K-cups was punctured, so my package arrived covered in coffee grounds. But Amazon was very kind about it, and shipped me a replacement quickly. Other than that, though, this is tasty, strong coffee. I just wish they'd put it on Subscribe & Save.

However, I now must get my hands on some TMM because I think I detect a difference, and wish to compare them side-by-side.  Jet fuel is excellent and I think that it has more body to it than does TMM, but I have not had a TMM for a few months now (Costco stopped handling it!)  The taste is very similar to that of TMM.  I think JF gives you that little coffee buzz while TMM does not.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Not so great change in price!
review/text: For those who love bold coffee, Jet Fuel, is for you.  Other brands that offer bold roasts are just not as good.  I am going to see if they sell jet fuel that are not for K-cups also.  When I travel, I do not always have access to a Keurig and have to settle for coffee that is subpar.  My only complaint is the increase in price!  I used to pay $17.83 per month but over the last 3 months the amount has sky rocketed.  Not sure as to why but I imagine it is because of several reasons and one of them is the increase in demand as Jet Fuel is no longer a cult favorite and more people are starting to buy it.  If the price does not decrease I will be forced to cancel my subscribe and save subscription.

He has tried others in the K-cups, but for the need of extra bold coffee...these won hands down.  Give them a try...you won't be disappointed!!!

review/text: First, you have to like real, bold coffee (which I do) to like this coffee. If you like this coffee, also try Organic, Black Tiger, and Wake Up Call. Each of these is similar but have slightly different tastes. I like to buy them in boxes of 50 using automatic delivery (can't beat the price that way).<br /><br />The coffee tastes great. I would classify it as bold/extra bold. I gave it 5 stars, and I continue to buy it along with the others that I mentioned.

review/text: I gave my wife a Keurig last Christmas but, being a coffee purist, scorned using it. Then one morning I was running later than normal so I borrowed one of her K-cups and had a cup. Not bad but not my cuppa. I was intrigued and shopped around trying different coffees until I hit on the Jet Fuel. Strange name notwithstanding, an excellent cup of coffee. I do occasionally miss grinding and brewing, but this is sooooooo convenient and the coffee isn't bad.

review/summary: Lovely coffee Manufacturing defect causes grounds to pour
review/text: I love the strong but not burnt taste of the Jet Fuel K-cup coffee.  However, about every 3rd or 4th K-cup has an undetectable manufacturing defect. My husband works in manufacturing and compared a proper K-cup with a defective Jet Fuel by dissecting both.  The K-cups have an internal filter but the defective Jet Fuel ones the interior filter is torn around the top edge which then allows a great quantity of coffee grounds to dispense in your cup. Then there is the mess of grounds to clean up in the Keurig coffee maker not to mention that drinking grounds is an experience you want to avoid. It's impossible to tell which Jet Fuel K-cups are fine and which are defective. It's a lovely strong coffee and was actually one of my favorites but I won't be purchasing any more of them because of the defect problem.

review/text: As a lover of strong coffee and a far-too-frequent Starbuks visitor, I was pleased to find a coffee of this quality for home use. The K-cups cannot be beat, and, for me, the taste is just amazing! If you like your coffee strong and dark, this is the k-cup for you. Better that Nantucket double diamond, on a par with many espresso's, but not too strong as a "daily drink". Also check out "Black tiger" from Coffee People - not quite as bold or bright, but good none-the-less.

Until I purchased Jet Fuel.  I absolutely love it.  Is has a slightly sweet (another review mentioned notes of chocolate and honey and I agree).  It has a rich taste and is full bodied.  It has a nice clean finish (I feel like I am reviewing a wine).  No bitterness and while it is full bodied it does not have an over-roasted burnt taste.  Sorry Emeril but Jet Fuel has now repalced Big Easy Bold as my subscribe and save monthly shipment (but I still love you too).

review/summary: Worthy of my morning cup
review/text: The Keurig machine is unbelievably convenient, but I find the majority of K-cups are simply weak and unpalatable. I always buy the coffees labeled "bold" as nothing else cuts it.<br /><br />Jet Fuel is a decent cup of coffee. It's not quite the body of a drip brewer, but comes pretty close. Close enough that I'm not inclined to schlep out the drip brewer and spill coffee grounds on the counter and wait 10 minutes before I can have my wake up beverage.<br /><br />One other thing - the cups are just loose in a big box, so you will want to have a basket or other container to put them in.

review/summary: One of the best bold kcup brews
review/text: My husband and I just canceled our save and subscribe for parisian nights and have switched over to jet fuel. It makes a strong cup of coffee with more caffeine and less bitterness than parisian. To me it doesn't make sense to use mild blend kcups since you'll end up with a watery cup of coffee. jet fuel is great with half and half and sugar or splenda and also makes a really nice cup of iced coffee.

review/summary: Jet Fuel Autopsy
review/text: Let me start by saying what this K-cup isn't.  It isn't extremely strong, unless maybe you are a Folger's drinker.  In that case, I suggest you pick a milder K-cup and then wash it clean with the 9.25 oz "water" setting.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I sacrificed one not-yet-brewed K-cup by removing the foil to measure the amount of coffee inside.  I found just slightly over 2 tbsp of fine ground very dark roasted coffee inside.  There is basically no "headroom" at this fill amount, so it would be a fair assessment that the roaster packed as much coffee in this K-cup as will fit.  This amount, 2 tbsp, is by common coffee brewing standards enough coffee to brew a 6 oz cup.  I only use the 5.25 oz brew setting with the Keurig machine.<br /><br />Now let me explain my coffee tastes.  My wife and I both normally drink french roast coffee brewed with the prescribed amount of coffee and cut with creamer and Splenda.  We like strong coffee that leaves an opaque splash stain in the cup while being poured.<br /><br />I still brew a pot of coffee every morning in a conical filter coffee maker.  The Keurig machine was purchased for brewing an occasional cup of coffee later in the day.<br /><br />I believe there are inherent flaws in the Keurig machine.  The brew cycle seems to be too quick to get ideal extraction and have yet to see a K-cup that doesn't pump out near-water after around 4 oz of coffee has been dispensed.  That being said, the K-cup convenience is great.<br /><br />As far as this K-cup is concerned, I think the flavor is medium/strong. It starts as something like a cup of Starbucks coffee (at the 5.25 oz  setting) and finishes with a bit more bite, similar to a "red-eye" (added shot of espresso), says my wife.  The amount of caffeine becomes quite apparent if you drink two cups back-to-back!<br /><br />In summary, this coffee does well at making the best out of a less than ideal system.  I recommend.

review/summary: great name
review/text: We have had the breville single serve coffee maker for several years now and have tried many different varieties of k cups.  My husband and I like our coffee strong enough for cream and sugar but dont like bitterness.  Jet Fuel is strong enough to use the larger cup size and still have great flavor.  It has no bitterness for such a strong cup of coffee.  I recently purchased and sent several boxes as gifts for family and friends who recently purchased kcup systems--my brother in law had been using the make your own k-cup with his "fancy" coffee beans but said the day he received these he ended up having 2 cups by 7:30 in the morning because it was so good--he had to stop himself from making more that day! I also love parisien nights by timothy's which has a slightly smoky/dark chocolate flavor and midnight magic which is slightly sweeter.  Jet Fuel is definitely one that we keep around all the time

review/summary: Too strong for an everyday coffee
review/text: My husband loves a good, full bodied cup of coffee.  His usual K-cup variety is the Coffee People's "Wake UP", but I thought we would try something a little stronger.  If  you want a STRONG cup of joe, the "Jet Fuel" is the way to go.  However, for our tastebuds, we'll stick witht the "Wale UP" for our every morning cup.

review/summary: A little too bitter
review/text: As a former St*rbucks drinker, I find I'm always looking for coffee that's "just a little stronger". Jet Fuel fills that need nicely. I can finally drink a good strong cup of coffee without going broke.<br />EDIT 5/6/10<br />I have returned to edit this review after trying Green Mountain's REVV. I am dropping this review to 3 stars because REVV is just so much better.<br />I found jet fuel to be a little bitter. The first time I drank it I went a little heavy on the half & half and didn't notice it. Over time the bitterness becomes quite distinct.<br />I have found that I much prefer REVV for the caffeine kick it provides while still being incredibly smooth.

review/text: I just recieved my Jet Fuel this morning and here are my first impressions after just a couple of cups:<br />Flavor is smooth, not bitter (maybe just a hint of aftertaste), deep and satisfying. That being said, I'll probably go back to my Keurig "Green Mountain" coffee next time anyway. I do like the Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging (about 36 cents per cup on the auto re-order program!). I cut the box open like a giant dispenser and put it in the cupboard above the coffee maker. Convenience is what it's all about, baby! (I expect at least a $10K reward for the idea, Keurig.)

review/summary: Not my favorite CP extra bold
review/text: I have tried Black Tiger and Wake Up Call so I thought I would give Jet Fuel a try. It's definitely strong enough, but both Black Tiger and Wake up Call have more interesting flavors.  Jet Fuel is like a one note band and the others are like combos or symphonies. It's a great note, but honestly I am now 1/3 the way through the 50 pack and I<br />pretty much blend it with another k cup just for the kick. It's not a great stand alone coffee, for me. Lacks complexity is they way coffee geeks would say it. It's like a<br />really strong cup of diner coffee. Hot, bold, but lacking sophistication.  Black Tiger is probably the most interesting cup to me; Wake up Call comes in second. With so<br />many really good strong extra bold k cups out there (Emeril's, GM Sumatra, Van Houtte Eclipse, etc.) Jet Fuel is just average.  Just lacks the depth and flavors to make it<br />a top choice. I drink it black with 6 ounces of water for the brew.  I'll be reordering one of the others when I need more.

review/summary: One of my top 2 favorites for my Keurig brewer!
review/text: After sampling a few brews, I narrowed down a couple that I would by 50 at a time.  This is one of them as well as Timothys Midnight Magic.  Flavor is nice and bold and I can brew a larger cup without sacrificing too much.  I have the B70 and brew this at the 10-oz setting.  12-oz is just a bit too much water.  I know the packaging is nice and "green" now but is a little bulky so that I can't store it in my cabinets.  Not a huge issue.  If you are a fan of flavorful, bold coffee, give this one a try!

Love Coffee People coffees.  Use Donut shop for a single cup of coffee.  Since I do not like really bold coffee (I drink it black), I run 3 of the largest size water through a single Jet Fuel K-cup to stretch the value even further.  Coffee People coffee is very smooth.  If you like really bold coffee, you will like Jet Fuel as a single cup serving.  Happy Java!
