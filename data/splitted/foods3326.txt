review/summary: Great alternative to soda
review/text: I gave up soda and have been looking for a replacement fix when I want a fizzy drink. This stuff has been great. All natural and tastes really good. I usually go with the variety pack so I can change things up, and really because all the flavors are so good. I definitely recommend these drinks to anyone!

review/summary: You're going to LOVE IT! Carbonated JUICE not soda!
review/text: SWITCH is 100% juice, but it is CARBONATED! Drinks like a soda, but it isn't--so much better for you and your family. I highly recommend it for families, especially teens and older who don't drink enough water or juice. It's a painless way to get them away from sodas and to drink something far more healthy! Switch comes in AWESOME flavors and this variety pack is WONDERFUL--something for everyone! From the lemon-lime to the Black Cherry, Watermelon-Strawberry to Orange-Tangerine, these all taste great, are 100% JUICE and NO ADDITIVES! Everyone in my family drinks Switch--my 76 year-old mother, my husband and my 20-something sons, all have a favorite flavor. Buying from Amazon is so easy, especially with the subscription service, you can have it auto-delivered on YOUR family's schedule! Easier than going out to the grocery store, where you will pay considerably more for a 4 pack! Amazon has the best selection and pricing on Switch that I have seen. Even the Grape flavored is superior to any other grape-artificially-flavored-syrup drink!<br />Switch has a lovely flavor, good selection, no additives, all natural juice PLUS carbonation. It's like having the BEST OF BOTH WORLDS--juice and soda!<br />Try Switch from Amazon today--you won't regret it and your family will LOVE IT and love you for buying it! Just don't tell them how healthy and good for them it is! ENJOY! You're gonna love it, too! I highly recommend this variety pack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LPMC3O">The Switch Variety Pack,  8.3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>

review/summary: We've Made The Switch!!
review/text: By far the best sparkling juice I've ever tried!  So juicy and full of flavor!!  My favorites are the Black Cherry, Lemon Lime and Orange Tangerine.  The kids go crazy for the Watermelon Strawberry, Grape and Kiwi.  Sometimes I am afraid to buy variety packs because there will be some left over...NOT with this one, every can is gone!<br />I think the big difference is because The Switch is 100% juice, so it's not over diluted like most of the other ones. I think Izzy is only 70% juice, so it has a lot less flavor.<br />If you like pop but don't want all the HFCS, artificial sweeteners etc, you should definitely give Switch a try!

review/text: We do not let our children drink soda, ("pop") so this is a wonderful substitute. They can't stand flavored seltzer water, but love this stuff. I have tried it myself, and it is really really good. Much better than Izzy. The orange tastes just like Fanta - I can't tell the difference. Highly recommended if you don't want processed sugar in your kid's drink.

review/summary: Disgustingly Sweet!
review/text: I bought this shortly after I quit drinking regular coke, I obviously knew it wouldn't be the same but expected it to give a bit of satisfaction when I craved soda, Boy was I wrong, this stuff is SWEET I know it's all natural fruit juice and that has sugar but even 28grams seems pretty high for 8 ounces. These taste like drinking a pixie stick, nothing like soda, I ended up giving some to a friend who loves that apple soda thats really sweet and even she said these were much sweeter and not very good. My fault for trusting the reviews and buying a case now I'm slowly forcing myself to drink them so they will be gone !!

review/summary: Switch vending machines, please.
review/text: In short:<br />Switch is exactly what it tries to be.  It is a 100% juice with carbonation.  You pay for the carbonation, flavors and convenience.  I have found competitors tend to have a lower juice percentage and/or augment the juice with Splenda or similar alternate.  Just be aware of what you want.  If it is a carbonated, 100% juice drink, give Switch a try (or 24 if you grab the variety pack).<br /><br />Full Review:<br />I purchased the variety pack, with concern for spending so much on a gamble.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the drinks and size.  It is a great treat every other day or so.  I think the 8oz size is perfect for accompanying a meal or on its own.  Like everyone, I have my favored flavors but there aren't any that I find undrinkable or unpleasant.<br /><br />I've seen/read some concerns over the calories/sugar/sweetness of the drinks that reviews say detract from the drink.  Quite frankly, I don't know if these reviewers know what is in fruit.  The only way to decrease these values is to remove the 100% fruit juice element which is half of this product, at least to me. (The other being carbonation)  I die a little every time I find a great looking product only to see the little Splenda logo.  If you like Splenda, more power (and products) to you :)  You can easily add water to this drink if the taste or stats are too much for you, but you can't subtract it, so I think Switch is perfect.<br /><br />Like many fruit juices, Switch uses grape and apple juice as fillers.  An example is the fruit juice order in the Orange Tangerine is "apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola"  I don't find the taste has suffered and I know the price is more manageable, from the use of apple and grape juice.<br /><br />Since there might be parents reading, I don't have kids, but believe it would be great for kids.  I know price is a concern, but I believe soda should be a treat not a staple food.  They are 8oz in place of the traditional 12oz of soda.  This gives your child less sugar (none refined) and a skinnier can to hold on to or package in a lunch box. (Also, no little straw to break off and get lost!)<br />I can't honestly tell you if I would have been willing to be different as a kid and have a Switch in place of a soda, but I know I definitely want it now.  If your kids don't want it in their lunch box, put it in yours. :)

review/text: I initially wanted to buy Izze, my favorite flavor is blackberry, but decided to just add it to my wishlist. Anyway, I noticed the Switch was a related item. I saw all of the good reviews and noticed it was a healthy drink with carbonation, which is what I wanted, and decided to buy it. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed drinking these they taste like what they are described as. The can seemed small to look at but when I would drink it with lunch or whenever I found that it was plenty to quench my thirst. I will buy again!

review/text: I have been looking for something to replace sodas in my life.  This does the trick.  It is not without calories but how much better are calories from fruit juice compared to either straight sugar or, way worse yet, with artificial sweeteners!!  I have enjoyed all the flavors.  They make a nice variety of tastes.  I choose the variety pack so I could sample each of the flavors.  It was a wise choice...and the price on the program for regular shipping every month is even better.  Much better flavors than R.W. Knudsen's new fruit spritzers (and they are cheaper).

review/summary: Ugggghh..sweet, very sweet :S
review/text: I wanted to exchange regular soda, so I went ahead and tried many other products, and while vitamin water was a good alternative for a little while, it wasn't something I could stand for long, very artificially flavored and so. I tried this one, and I certainly isn't my taste either, though it is definitely more naturally flavored than many other drinks, it is toooo sweet for my taste, except for the lemon and may be the Mandarin. If you want this as alternative to Soda to loose weight, then look elsewhere since it has about 120 Kcal in it, which is almost as a can of soda, though this one here is claiming to be all from fruit calories. If you are planning to have it as a natural replacement for artificial flavours, and you don't mind the extra sweet taste, then try it you may actually like it, but I know I didn't!

review/summary: I LOVE!!!
review/text: The Switch has truly come out with a product that should have mass appeal. A carbonated juice drink with ONLY natural sugars and it tastes great. No artificial sweeteners like Splenda or the toxic High Fructose Corn Syrup (corn sugar) just plain ole juice...though there's nothing plain about the taste of this stuff. It's fantastic.<br /><br />It comes in 8 flavors (6 in this variety pack) and each one has their own unique appeal. Starting with the watermelon/strawberry mix. I love it cause it's a nice blend of the two without either over powering the other to create a smooth drink that should please lovers of both flavors. The other mix is the orange/tangerine and it too is a nice blend, with the tangerine balancing out the orange very nicely. The other flavors include: Black Cherry (my personal favorite and the best tasting juice of the the entire line); Kiwi Berry (an unusual choice but I liked it even though it does have just a bit of a dull flavor); Grape (my mom liked it even though she hates grape so it's a winner. Not an over powering flavor either.) and finally lemon-lime (the one I thought I'd hate turned out to be one I actually liked enough to re-order it).<br /><br />I find myself drinking two or three of these a day and it's become my go to beverage after or during a meal. I also stopped drinking soda several years ago and this has been the perfect replacement for that.<br /><br />P.S. my mother is a diabetic and has been drinking one of these nearly every day for a few weeks now with no ill effects. Just in case anyone was wondering.

My boyfriend is even pickier than me and he is an advid Dr Pepper fan, but he loves them all. He HATES anything cherry flavored, but he really loves the black cherry - I can't believe it! They all taste exactly like juice, but with a little fizz. I usually only drink water because I am strict when it comes to my health and diet so the size of these cans are perfect. I would not be able to finish them if they were any bigger. I think the people that complain in their reviews about the size of the cans being too small are missing the point of this product. If you want a healthy alternative to water, purchase this product!

review/text: I have ordered this product many times and finally decided to write a review as to why I like it so much.  I drink soda occasionally but I like to have an alternative every now and then and this product is perfect for those times. I like the idea of being able to have a variety although my favorite flavors are grape and black cherry.  However, the other flavors taste just as good.  At first I thought that the 8.3 ounces wasn't enough but it's actually just the right serving especially if having it with a late night snack.  I have placed this item on auto delivery to have one case delivered once a month but if my 6 year old twin sons keeping begging me for some I may have to have 2 cases delivered once a month.  I started out with the Izze drinks but I like this product much better.  Happy drinking.

review/summary: Refreshing and delicious
review/text: We're big fans of fizzy beverages and have been trying to get away from artificial ingredients, namely HFCS. I came across The Switch and thought I would give the sampler pack a try. Now I think we're hooked. The flavors are strong - in a good way - no muted fruit juice here. If you're looking for an alternative to pop or soda or want to mix up what you're drinking, I highly recommend giving this a try.

review/summary: Love Everything But The Price
review/text: I really enjoy the multipack of these sparkling juices. They will vary from can to can - sometimes more tart or less can to can, and sometimes more sparkling can to can. I am on my second case of these, and really enjoy the tartness and variety of flavors. My only beef is the high price - kind of steep for 8oz cans in my opinion. I will continue to buy, however unless I find a better price locally.

review/summary: Try For Yourself
review/text: I read reviews to try and help make my decision about something, but I'm glad I listened to those who spoke about the positives of this drink.The flavors are all excellent and the orange can actually be compared to Fanta as far as taste goes. They are just juice with carbonation because some people, like me, enjoy the bubbles of soda but not the empty calories. At least when I drink this I can get some vitamin C out of it. The cans are too cute and I dont feel guilty if I drink 2 of these. The sugars are fine because they come from the fruit. I just love this drink and will continue to buy them. Very delicious and satisfying. I wonder what else the Switch brand will come up with.

review/summary: Great tasting
review/text: First, my shipment arrived without any dent or leak in any of the cans which is awesome.<br />I will begin to review all the flavors (except for cherry, I have not tried the cherry one) :<br /><br />- Grape : This one is my favorite. It tastes almost like normal grape soda but you can still taste the real fruit juice. It leaves the after taste of real grape juice. The carbonation is about the right amount.<br /><br />- Orange : My second favorite flavor. It was very yummy and taste very real. If you let a friend drink it, he/she will be able to tell it is made from real juice and not artificial flavor.<br /><br />- Lemon lime : Great combination of flavors. The tartness is just right but the flavor is just ok, nothing impressive.<br /><br />- Kiwi/berry & Watermelon/strawberry : I found these two too sweet. The kiwi/berries taste is too strong it almost reminds me of artificial flavors in candy.<br /><br />- Cherry : I did not try this flavor but my boyfriend said it is his favorite and he loves it.<br /><br />Bottom line : Get this variety pack to see what flavors you like. My bf and I both love carbonated drinks but stopped drinking regular soda a while ago due to high fructose corn syrup.  The can size is a little small but it is easy to pack with your lunch to take on the go.

review/summary: Good Tasty Product
review/text: These are excellent canned "sodas", with great flavor.  They obviously use concentrated apple juice to kick up the sweetness, so you don't really decrease your sugar intake much if any, and they are carbonated so if you don't like that feature they are not for you.  Myself, I like both of those facts.  They provide a very refreshing change from a cola or typical lemon-lime drink and still have the carbonation.  Plus they have better, more "natural" flavor than most of the flavored sodas on grocery store shelves.<br /><br />My only complaint is they size (reason for only 4 stars) -- only 8 ounces, but if you have children under 12 (or are an elderly slender woman) this is probably perfect size.

review/text: I'm not a big health freak and love soda and everything sugary and bad for you, but this stuff is incredible. Many people want to compare this to Izze, but Izze is only 70% compared to The Switch's 100%. And you can taste the difference in how natural the product is. Since I bought this to give up soda, the fizziness gives your brain a feeling that it's the same unhealthy soda you normally have, but the rest of your body will feel the difference. It definitely costs a bit more that a 24 pack of soda, but compared to Naked juice (the other delicious 100% juice beverage) it's a bargain deal.

review/summary: Good, but not pure single fruit for each flavor
review/text: I had watermelon pop made by the Coca-Cola company for China while at Epcot center's Coke pavilion in the past and wondered why they never marketed it in the USA because it's excellent.  So when I saw watermelon berry as a flavor with Switch and that it was pure juice besides, I had to try it and all their flavors.  Overall, the watermelon doesn't disappoint and does remind me of that soda, but probably better having real juice in it.  But all the flavors, in addition to the described flavors have added juices to them that have nothing to do with the flavor (i.e. apple and acerola).  For flavors like lemon and lime this makes sense because if they didn't have other juices added they would be very sour with no added sugar, but it is disappointing for flavors like grape where those additions clearly subtract from the "grape juice" flavor, which I'd prefer to be stronger.  Even so, it still tastes better than grape soda and grape is the strongest flavor.  None of the flavors here are 'bad' at all.  All taste better than flavored soda, IMO and have to be much better for you with plenty of vitamin C and no added sugar (fructose is better for you than sucrose).  Certainly, having carbonation in juice (particularly the orange flavor) is definitely different.  It's worth trying if not replacing fruit flavored soda entirely.

review/summary: Flavored Apple Juice
review/text: I was looking for a good alternative to sugary soft drinks so I tried The Switch. I wanted something carbonated and not plain water. The Switch meets this criteria, but I was hoping it would be better. It is very sweet and every flavor tastes like apple juice. There is not much variation in the flavors. I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006K3UN6M">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, 8.4 oz Cans, 24 pk, Variety : Clementine, Blackberry & Apple</a>. I'll try diluting with water to see if it gets better. I would not recommend this or purchase it again.<br /><br />Update 7-11-12<br />I still am not a big fan of The Switch. I ended up giving the rest of the case away. However I have found a new alternative to soda.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P02EX8">TalkingRain Sparkling Essence, 4-Flavor Variety, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 30)</a> has no sugars or artificial sweeteners. It is just sparkling water with fruit essence. I recommend that to anybody wanting a soda alternative.

If you need the fizz, buy a carbonator like sodastream, you can fizz up your own water or juice and add organic fruit syrups.

review/summary: Gets too soggy a bit quickly.
review/text: Honey bunches of oats? Check.<br />Strawberries? Check.<br />Deliciousness? CHECK!!<br /><br />There is however one flaw to this cereal... gets soggy wayyy too quickly. Now I realize due to the ingredients they will get soggy quickly by nature, but 5 minutes in I still want to experience some CRUNCH. Unfortunately if I snooze I lose.

review/summary: little pieces
review/text: Although I got them for a great price I won't be ordering this again from Amazon. I got 4 boxes of honey bunches of oats with strawberries but I'm guessing due to so much travel, by the time they got to me, the cereal was in pretty small pieces. All flakes had been broken down, and the granola wasn't in much chunks either. It was ok to eat, but is better not shaken so much.

review/summary: I love the strawberries in this cereal
review/text: I'm a fan of Honey Bunches of Oats Cereal. There are a bunch of them but I've only had the one with just honey, the one with almonds and now this one with strawberries. I love the strawberries in the cereal. It provides a really nice sweet and tart taste. The texture of the strawberries when combined with milk if firm but not too firm - just right. And the flakes with the honey bunches are delicious. My only knock on the cereal is it does tend to get a little soggy. So if you eat it quickly enough you won't have that problem.

review/summary: The best cereal I have tasted
review/text: This is probably the best cereal I have tasted. Over the years I have found that I don't like cereals as much. After trying post cereals like Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds, I realized that it was really the Kellogg's cereals that I didn't like. I really like the Post cereals, mostly the Honey Bunches of Oats, and especially this one - with Strawberries. It tastes slightly sweet, not too much, and the strawberries add just that hint of fruit that goes so well with the rest of the cereal. Best of all, my wife, who doesn't like cereals that much, now eats these every day, sometimes even for lunch or dinner! I would definitely recommend this cereal to anyone who has not enjoyed the other cereals as much.

review/text: I love my HBOS!  But @ $4 a box it's not a good value.  I bought 3 4-packs at Amazon for $9 ea. ($27).  They had a difficult journey.  Each box was damaged, but I got a good deal and they tasted fine.  Now the price has gone up dramatically ($16 for a 4-pack) and I see another customer commented about the poor quality of the packaging when it arrived.  I'll stick to my local store.<br />Really, look at the price increase!  That's crazy.

review/summary: Super Soggy can't even enjoy the taste!
review/text: It taste great for the first 2-3 spoonfuls then it all turns into a red-ish mush with strawberries here and there. I'm one of those people that hates soggy cereal and do my best to stay away from the flaked stuff because it always gets soggy fast. I'm surprised this got so soggy after just pouring the milk in. Taste wise I'd give it 5/5 first 3 spoonfuls where great! cereal wise I  give it a 1/5 it doesn't hold up well in milk and I think that's one of the key points of being a great cereal. Overall 3/5 they need to work on making this stuff less soggy.<br /><br />and to those that disagree enjoy your mushy cereal!<br />User Tip: Pour your milk first then the cereal on. It stays crunchy longer.

review/text: The tea is really good. You can try it at Starbucks if you're not sure you want to make the jump into 144 bags.<br /><br />My only comment against buying this product here is that you can often find individual boxes with a lower unit cost at Target. We frequently see it at the one near our house for $2.90 per box of 20 or 14.5 cents per bag. Amazon offers great savings compared to many other retailers, but you might want to check around first.<br /><br />I know that I'd be buying from Amazon if they offered "Subscribe and Save" on this.

review/summary: NOT a good product
review/text: My husband tested + for Celiac's disease this year and we've been trying ALL of the gluten free products.  Having loved King Arthur's other (gluten) products in the past, we were surprised and very dissapointed in this mix. First - the box is deceiving.  It pictures chocolate chip cookies.  Well, folks - this mix does not include the chips. The Betty Crocker mix does and is $2 less for the same size.  More - this mix is just boring in taste - even with all of the best quality add-ins.  Butter, pecans, Herseys choco chips.) The cookies were only edible while still hot.  The cooled ones fall apart in your hands and are undercooked.  Go elsewhere my gluten-free friends.  Sorry to say.

review/summary: Great Treats - Liver is Liver...
review/text: Our Shitzu is very picky when it comes to treats, which is good I guess.  Only puppy sized Milkbones and Dried Liver Treats.  We used a different brand in the past, but tried PureBites and he loves them, just as much.  The other brand sells them in a hard plastic (reusable)container and the PureBites are in a bag/pouch.  Not sure if that contributes to more breakage of pieces or if it's just they way they are processed.  Since our pooch is a small dog, he doesn't need "big bites", so these are just fine for him.  Price per ounce seems better on the PureBites too.

review/text: These liver treats are awesome!! My dog loves them and they definitely make a nice reward especially after getting his nails cut. My dog is also kind of a picky eater and he doesn't really like his dog food, but since he's allergic to potatoes he doesn't have very many options to what kind of dog food he eats. To coax him to eat his food, sometimes I'll get a piece of these treats, crush it up and sprinkle it over his food. He seriously is the best eater after the liver treats are all over his kibbles. I also gave these treats to my cousins chihuahua whos also a really picky eater. She a little worse than my dog, she doesn't like any kind of treats, but she'll eat these! Yes, these are kind of expensive especially since I'm still in college, but it's so worth seeing my doggie happy :)

review/text: These treats truly are as pure as you can get -- 100% beef liver and nothing else.  This also means that they're grain free, which is fantastic for dogs with gas problems.  Switching from other (high-quality) treats to PureBites liver reduced the frequency and potency of my dog's rear-end emissions by about 90 percent.  Both my dogs love these treats.  The only, minor drawback is that the bottom of the bag tends to have a little pile of tiny bits and pieces of treats -- at that point, I'll pour out a little pile for each of my dogs and they lick them up like candy.

review/text: My two finicky dogs just love, love this snack! They don't just eat any snack that comes their way, in fact, they usually turn their noses up when I try to give them other pretty darn good natural dog snacks, but this one is a winner! The bite-sized pieces are just the right size for them (they are slightly under medium-sized dogs, peke mixes) and although they have been eating this snack for years, they never grow tired of it. The 16 oz bag lasts us for about two months (two dogs), which is pretty darn good considering the price. I have tried the other flavors, but we stay away from chicken and cheese because of the allergy equation. The fish is also excellent, but the price is a bit steeper, so we pretty much stick to the liver. YUM YUM WOOF WOOF!
