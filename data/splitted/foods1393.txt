review/summary: Nothing at all like Fig Newtons, but still tasty.
review/text: Ok, I think that Fig Newtons are the greatest cookie ever sold in a package (sure, I like homemade chocolate chip cookies even more, who doesn't?). I agree with the late-great Jean Shepherd in that one should eat those tasty cake like creations by the fistful.  Not only are Fig Newtons tasty, they are fairly healthful, as snack products go.<br /><br />Nabisco has made quite a few Newton spin offs and most have missed the mark in my opinion.<br /><br />These "Newtons Fruit Thins" are nothing at all like Fig Newtons. While Fig Newtons are cake like and soft, these are cookie like and crispy.<br /><br />But once I got over that, I found these little crisp wafers rather endearing and tasty. I found they go very well with ice-cream. They have a subtle fruit taste, and a nice crisp texture.<br /><br />They do share one thing with the Real Thing- as snacks go, they are also moderately healthful- eaten in moderation, of course!

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: Tried by myself and 3 children ages 7, 9 & 11. Not super healthy but probably healthier than most store bought cookies. The taste is akin to animal crackers with little pieces of cranberry. I did not taste any cranberry flavor, the bits just added to the texture. The kids liked them but it wouldn't be something they clamored for.

review/text: I have always liked Fig Newtons and I was curious what these "Fruit Thins" would taste like.  I was plesently surprised and I really liked them.  I find them good for a quick pick up in the afternoon at work.  They are a good break from protein bars and that type of pick up.  I highly recomend this product.

review/summary: Interesting
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect with these. They're not quite a cracker, and not quite a cookie. The ... wafer? biscuit? ... has that Newton-y flavor, similar to the cake of the original cookies, and the fruit flavor isn't overpowering. I'm not a big fan of this particular flavor combination though (cranberry citrus). I would try another flavor, though, before dismissing them.<br /><br />All in all, I'm not sure which snacking niche this is looking to fill. It isn't health food, isn't a sweet treat, isn't a kid's snack, isn't a dessert. It's a munchable, I suppose, for adults around the kitchen.

review/summary: Yummy goodness!
review/text: I love these cookies: crunchy, citrus-y, yummyness! The complimentary flavors of orange and cranberry are a favorite of mine, and having those packed into a thin, crisp cookie, well that just makes my day. The cranberries are a tad tough for my liking, but that's a teeny-tiny nitpick. As far as cookies go, Nabisco has come up with a winner that isn't completely bad for the body: there's no high fructose corn syrup (sugar and fructose are used to sweeten the cookies), artificial flavors or colors. Some of the better ingredients are unbleached enriched flour, whole grain flour, rolled oats, and dried cranberries.<br /><br />At 140 calories a serving (three substantial-sized cookies), they are a nice treat that include 1 gram of fiber, 2 grams of protein, and have 7 grams of sugar. Not bad. Have only two cookies and that's less than 100 calories for a quick snack. Perfectly doable in my diet. They aren't too sweet and they satisfy my craving for a treat without the feeling of guilt left behind (which may or may not happen with other cookies). While these aren't a health food by any means, they're far better than most other cookie choices out there. I'll be sure to try the other flavors in the Newtons Fruit Thins line, as well. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEJ968">Newtons Fruit Thins Cranberry Citrus Oats, 10.5-Ounce (Pack of4)</a> are a great, flavorful, totally scrumptious morsel that I heartily recommend!

review/summary: Well, Its Not Bad for FREE
review/text: When I opened the bag the first thing I noticed was that even after being shipped, most of the cookies were complete and not just pieces.  Saying that, maybe I should have stopped there.  The cookie (cracker) is two inches in diameter and looks like a 'big' Ritz cracker.  The outside in scalloped and there are nine wholes in the center (maybe for more even cooking), but there are few pieces of fruit visible.  The flavor is 'cranberry citrus oats' but there are just a few dried cranberries and the citrus flavor must be from the 'natural flavor' mentioned as the last ingredient on the label.<br /><br />The serving size is three cookies which have a total of 140 calories with 45 calories (3.5g) coming from 'fat'.  With 22g of carbs it's a very fat cookie.  For the flavor you get versus the calories you get, it's not a very good trade.  On the plus side it only has 95 mg of sodium and 7 g of sugar (yeah!).  Try some sugarless gum instead.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz

review/summary: Tasty but not a Newton!
review/text: These comments are for "Newtons Fruit Thins - Cranberry Citrus Oat" sold by Nabisco.<br /><br />The package states "crispy cookies" think the firmness and thickness of a graham cracker - yes that firm. These 3-inch round wafers come in a rigid plastic tray that slides into a foil-lined package. Nonetheless several cookies in the two packages I sampled were broken into several large pieces upon opening. Probably not typical but that's what I observed.<br /><br />I found the cookies brittle; they had a tendency to break into several pieces after a bite. As an adult I could compensate be adjusting my method of holding the wafer but children will have a problem.<br /><br />The cranberry citrus oat had a pleasant flavor with a hit of citrus. The package state "made with real fruit" therefore what you have are many small pieces of dried cranberries throughout the cookie. I like cranberries but after they are dried and baked they become semi-hard and chewy and tend to stick to your teeth.<br /><br />I was somewhat taken back by the work "Newtons" in large letters on the package. My understanding of this term is of a soft chewy fruit filled cookie like a fig or apple Newton. I do not see the connection then again I am not in Sales or Marketing where these decisions are made.

review/summary: Enjoyable alternative to the classic Newton!
review/text: The Newtons Fruit Thins in the cranberry citrus flavor are a surprisingly good addition to the Nabisco snack line. I was expecting them to be more akin to the original Newtons, but the Fruit Thins are more like a shortbread cookie: thin with a good snap. The fruit pieces are flavorful and chewy, and the cookie itself is very satisfying, having a flavor not unlike animal crackers.<br /><br />Packing 140 calories in just one serving (three cookies), the Fruit Thins are a better alternative than some snacks out there, and are a good source of mono- and polyunsaturated fats. For those who are interested, here's a breakdown of nutritional content:<br /><br />CALORIES: 140 Calories from Fat: 45<br />TOTAL FAT: 5g (8%)<br />Saturated Fat: 1g (5%)<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Polyunsaturated Fat: 2.5g<br />Monounsaturated Fat: 1g<br />CHOLESTEROL: 0mg<br />SODIUM: 95mg (4%)<br />POTASSIUM: 40mg (1%)<br />TOTAL CARBOHYDRATES: 22g (7%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 1g<br />Sugars: 7g<br />PROTEIN: 2g<br /><br />And there is no high fructose corn syrup, which I greatly appreciate.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend the Newtons Fruit Thins to anyone looking for that classic Newton flavor, but in an updated, refreshing, crispy cookie form!

review/text: I love the Newtons Fruit thins and my wife loves them even more.  They have a pleasant taste and light crispy texture to them.  One should expect to have broken up cookies if not careful with a product that is baked and is crispy and light.  I'm not sure the town we are living in now has them, but when my wife and I visited family in Fargo, I "let" her stock up on a ton to bring back.  "Let" being that she only grabbed 4 packages and I told her to go ahead and get 10.<br /><br />Great product and we hope they never go away.

review/summary: Not at all like a fig newton and not a cookie
review/text: I know this says that it is a "thin" Newton but I expected it to be a cookie and it wasn't.  It was super thin, crispy and crunchy like a cracker.  It had a slight fruit flavor and just not at all what I would associate with Newtons as a soft cookie or even cookies in general.  I was disappointed with the flavor (not fruity enough for me).  I was disappointed with the texture (super thin, hard, crispy).  I think if you are looking for a cracker that is not salty you should try these, but if you want a cookie look elsewhere.

review/text: Newton's Fruit Thins combine pieces of cranberry with an orange flavor in a crunchy bite. The the thin is like a cracker, but sweet like a cookie. Makes me think of some biscuits I had in England. Right after these were delivered, my mom came over to our house with a wedge of brie. A slice brie on these Fruit Thins goes perfect. I also think cream cheese would be nice. Whether eaten as a snack or served with cheese for tea/coffee or a light desert, these thins are highly recommended.

review/summary: Delicious and delightful.
review/text: These cookies are really quite delicious.  I have been sampling them with a nice cup of hot tea and find them both delicious and delightful.  They remind me of a shortbread with fruit in it.  The 2" cookie is very thin and crisp.  The flakes of cranberry are not only large enough to be recognizable visually, but also to get the taste of cranberries in each bite.  The citrus flavor is there also, just much more subtle.  The cookies come packaged in a plastic two-compartment tray.  Considering that my package had traveled through the mail, I still had 27 completely intact cookies.  I have great hopes for getting unbroken cookies from the grocery shelf packages.<br /><br />A recommended serving of 3 cookies has a calorie count of 140 with 45 of those calories coming from fat.  According to the label they contain 8 grams of whole grain per serving.  Unlike some whole grain products I've tried, these cookies did not have that slightly unpleasant 'dry' feeling in my mouth.  All in all, my family enjoyed this flavor combination so much that they want me to buy the other two varieties.  With 30 cookies per package these Nabisco Newtons Fruit Thins will last for a reasonable length of time around the house.  Always considering that we will have to be reasonable in our consumption habits first!

review/summary: Delightfully tasty!
review/text: I received this today and was very anxious to pop open the bag and dig in.  I was a bit curious.  I am a lover of Fig Newtons, and thought this would be a fun thing to try.  By just the picture, one may wonder if the cookies would be a bit on the dry side.  I can say, enthusiastically that they are not.  Fruit Thins are delightfully crispy (not hard), they have a light sweetness, are moist (as crisp thins go) and truly mouth-wateringly tasty.  The first word to pop into my mind, after taking a bite, was a very firm "YUM!"  The crispness combined with the chewy cranberries is positively addicting and oh-so-good.  Newtons Fruit Thins is a snack that will be loved by kids and adults alike.  Lower in fat (5 grams of fat and 140 calories per 3 cookies) than an average cookie, made with real fruit, whole grains and no high fructose corn syrup, these are the perfect solution when the sweet-tooth munchies rear it's ugly head.<br /><br />Though I'm not a huge lover of cranberry, the taste is just perfect in these thins.  There is a tasty and chewy tang provided by the cranberries that is light, not overpowering and truly lends a great amount of flavor and texture to these thins.  Please note that there are additional flavors available in the Newtons Fruit Thins line, including: Blueberry Brown Sugar, Fig and Honey, and Raspberry Chocolate.  I have not tried any other flavor except the Cranberry Citrus Oats, but truly plan to.  I loved these and highly recommend them!!

To my palate, the orangey and oaty flavors dominate and the cranberries whisper to me as an aftertaste.<br />The packaging, with its plastic inner tray and metal tab closures assures that the cookies (or should I call them Newtons?) stay fresh and intact. There are 30 (10 servings) to a package, which works out to 22.75 cents per cookie, a little pricey.<br />Nevertheless, they're a fun alternative to other snacks and well worth a try.

review/text: These are very tasty, although the "Newtons" name threw me a little.  I do like Newtons cookies, and I opened these expecting something soft and fruity.  Instead, I got something crisp and fruity.  To look at them, I didn't think they'd pull off the "fruity" part -- again, thinking of a fruit-filled Newton -- but the fruit flavors do shine through.<br /><br />The ingredients are relatively straightforward, easily in line with "don't eat it if you can't pronounce it" guidelines (although I flinched a bit when I saw "...and/or palm oil").  I do think the 3-cookie serving size is a little unrealistic, but then again, many products use unrealistic serving sizes in their nutrition assessment.  It's easy enough to figure out where you'll be if you eat, say, a 6-cookie serving, and they do well in terms of sodium and overall fats -- even better if you score a box that uses unsaturated soy oil instead of saturated palm oil, although there's no way to select for that.<br /><br />My only dilemma now is choosing among these tasty cranberry ones, or trying the blueberry brown sugar or raspberry chocolate next time.  Not a bad dilemma!

review/text: Nabisco is a brand I trust and it didn't disappoint with this crisp cookie alternative to the classic chewy Fig Newtons, which are more cake-like in texture. I enjoyed the not-to-sweet flavor of the cookie & fruit combo and have added these new Newton Fruit Thins to my regular snack purchases.<br /><br />Unfortunately, having them shipped resulted in over half of the cookies arriving broken. The packaging & cookies themselves just don't lend itself to normal shipment wear & tear. Though the price point is better on amazon.com subscription service than what I pay at my local grocery, the breakage doesn't make the price savings worth it.

review/summary: A nice, tasty crunch
review/text: I'm a big fan of cranberry and orange flavors along with traditional style Newtons, so I jumped on the chance to try these out. I think they got the cranberry and orange combination just right, sweet but not overpoweringly so, tart but nothing that will make your mouth pucker. The crispyness of the cracker was a nice surprise, not chewy but not so crispy that it fell apart into crumbles. I really liked the resealable package, although really these didn't last long enough that going stale was an issue. I'd definitely buy these again when I'm craving something that's tart and tangy.

review/summary: Crispy & Tasty!
review/text: Newtons Fruit Thins are a crispy and tasty snack. The flavor of orange and cranberry is subtle, but adds a slight sweetness to the cookie. They are not as sweet as a cookie, but have just enough sweetness to satisfy a craving, much like a graham cracker. They are a great snack with some healthy ingredients, so if you have a sweet craving, these are a much better option than a typical cookie.

review/summary: I miss these... so much
review/text: I used to eat Fig Newtons as a child but they fell out of favor in my house after about a decade. They were "OK" at best to me but nothing I'd ever go out of my way to pick up. These things on the other hand are another story.<br /><br />Package:<br />The bag is resealable and the thins sit in a plastic tray. So that's a big plus. It's also bright and will stand out in your cabinet. I doubt that you'll lose sight of these with all the other cookies and what not that you may have.<br /><br />The Thins:<br />They are thin of course and break easy but not into a bunch of little pieces like a Nature Valley bar will. The flavor is fantastic. I like cranberries and I like all citrus fruits (orange being the case here) so the two together in this oaty cookie thin are delicious. I don't find the flavor to be overwhelming either. Everything is baked into harmony so each thin tastes as good as the last.<br /><br />I don't pay too much attention to nutrition facts but I know that they are healthier than your typical cookie. If you are like me and grow tired of the heavy sweets and just want something light but flavorful, these thins might be just the snack you were looking for.

review/summary: Nice, Filling Snack!
review/text: I'm not a fan of fig newtons so I was skeptical about these, but I thought they would be worth a try. I'm glad I did - they're surprisingly tasty! They taste kind of like a thin shortbread biscuit with a hint of citrus and little pieces of cranberry. The biscuit flavor is the strongest, but they definitely don't skimp on the cranberry. In fact, one of the drawbacks (kind of an obvious one) is that the cranberries can get stuck in your teeth.<br /><br />I really like the ingredient list:<br /><br />unbleached enriched flour, sugar, whole grain wheat flour, soybean and/or palm oil, rolled oats, dried cranberries, fructose, salt, baking soda, soy lecithin, natural flavor<br /><br />It's not a long list and recognize almost everything on that list - always a good sign! And health-wise, they're low in fat but still provide some (though little) nutritional value by way of protein (2g for 3 cookies) and fiber. I sometimes eat them after lunch when I crave something sweet and they actually keep me satisfied for longer than most post-lunch snacks I've tried!<br /><br />I can't say that I'd reach for this time and time again because I like to go all out with cookies since I don't indulge in them that often and I'm not the biggest fan of shortbread biscuits, but I think most people will like these (especially good as a tea time snack).

review/text: This have been a huge hit with the whole family.  They remind me of a tea cracker more than a cookie or anything "Newton".  They aren't overly sweet and have a subtle orange and cranberry flavor.  The cranberries can be a bit chewy but add to the overall texture of the cookies.  They also travel well and are great cookies for lunch boxes and toddlers!

review/summary: More a cookie than a "thin", but that's not a bad thing.
review/text: I ordered the Newtons Fruit Thins because they were intriguing. As a long-time fan of the Newton cakes (Fig Newtons, Strawberry Newtons, etc) I was expecting either a soft, chewy product or some kind of a cracker.<br /><br />It was neither, but rather a fruit cookie that in some ways reminded me of the stained-glass cookies my mother used to bake at Christmas (these had chopped up bits of colorful fruit candies in them, hence the resemblance to stained glass windows). They've got a satisfying crunch, and they're more aromatic than most packaged cookies I've had. The citrus and cranberry flavors really come off with a scent that's like cranberry-orange juice, which may not appeal to your average chocolate chip cookie fan, but my 2-year-old certainly enjoys them and I feel better giving her these rather than some Chips-A-Hoy.<br /><br />These really fill a snack/dessert niche better than a fruit or healthy snack niche, so long as you order them with that expectation you won't be disappointed.

review/text: These are quite tasty and filling to boot. I much prefer them over granola or cereal bars for a snack.  I don't think they should be called Newtons though, as that brings to mind a moist chewy treat and these are not.  Still, I would have given them a higher rating if they were even remotely good for you.  For the amount of calories and fat in these, I will usually choose to eat regular fruit Newtons.  In summary; these are tasty and a nice treat on occassion but not a healthy alternative to regular Newtons.

review/summary: Tasty alternative to a Fig Newton
review/text: Gramma and I tried these tasty Newtons. The taste of the orange & cranberry was a bit adventurous for my nearly 90 year old Gramma, not your normal Fig Newton. As with most orange cookies we have tried in the past, the orange did not over take the cranberry, the 2 tastes complimented one another. The texture is that of a nice English tea biscuit and we did have ours with tea. Per Gramma, the sodium was not too bad, she is always reading the sodium content in BOTH of our foods and letting me know when mine is too high.<br /><br />Some have noted that the taste is not very fruity, my cousin stated such to me, but I enjoy my treats (desserts & snacks) not to be to heavy in their taste, whether that be sweet or sour. I know many prefer a very sweet treat when eating a cookie, whether that cookie or treat be sweet or not.<br /><br />As some have stated, these are not moist, nor anywhere near as soft as normal Fig Newton. If you are looking for a soft, moist & chewy cookie, these will not be your ' cup of tea'. They are more cracker like, as some have opined, as they are more like tea cookies.<br /><br />If I were having any kind of group over, I would serve these amongst the fruits and other offerings I would have available. I would recommend these cookies to anyone wanting a different or unique treat. But, if you are looking for a soft, sweet and moist treat, these will not be satisfy for your craving as they are definitely more cracker-like.

review/summary: Less would have been more
review/text: The taste of the Newton's Fruit Thins was pretty good. It's a nice crunchy treat, and I really enjoyed the cranberry citrus and oat flavor. It was like a really thin and crisp designer oatmeal cookie.  I would have liked the product more if the cookies were smaller in size.  The snacks are rather large and round in shape, and being so thin they easily break and crumble. If they were 1/4 of the current size you could easily consume them in one or two bites and eliminate the crumbs.  The packaging leaves a lot to be desired. The outer foil bag isn't bad, but the inside plastic tray is clumsy and tough to slide back into the resealable wrap, and combined with the large crumbly nature of the cookie already mentioned above I doubt very much if anyone buying these in a store ends up with more than half of the cookies actually being whole by the time they get home.  Ordering them from Amazon easily guarantees half the product inside will be in pieces -- but like I said... the smaller size (even if they are broken pieces) makes 'em easier to eat!

review/summary: A delicious, healthy snack!
review/text: First of all, I have to say that I am not a fan of cranberry or citrus (of any kind), so I was a little worried. But I opened the bag, called my two boys over and we dug right in. I was pleasantly surprised (and shocked) that I did like the flavor--a lot. And both of my children loved them! It's been a long time since I've had the original Newtons cookies but I can tell you I like these much more. Newtons Fruit Thins remind me of thin shortbread cookies with little bits of fruit in them. And I guess I shouldn't say "little bits" since they are more like swirls of fruit. Regardless, they were absolutely delicious and nutritious. Newtons Fruit Thins are my new go-to late night snack. They're definitely a healthier, low fat, high fiber alternative to a piece of chocolate or candy.

review/text: So, OK. The Mrs. Fields thing is a cheap shot. Newton's fruit thins are packaged cookies or cracker-like cookies. So gotta compare apples with apples (or, in this case Cranberry Citrus Oat with, well, I know of nothing to compare them with!)<br /><br />Let's try comparing them with Newton's Fig Newtons. These are a hundred times better and I always liked fig newtons OK.<br /><br />The best part, of course, is "no high fructose corn syrup," "whole grain," "natural fruit flavors," "made with real fruit."  And they don't taste all that natural. They taste as good as the worst junk food around. High praise, huh?  Try them dunked in milk--nonfat, of course.<br /><br />----<br />The reviewer is working on a book called "Here's How I Don't Cook."

review/summary: Satisfying Snack For All Ages
review/text: Newton's Fruit Thins are a delightful "cookie biscuit" that satisfied a wide range of ages.  We had the Cranberry Citrus Oats and found them to be reminiscent of the flavor of a cranberry/citrus muffin but with the satisfying crunch of a cookie.  The thins are drier in texture than cookies but the fruit makes them enjoyable and kids as young as 10 enjoyed them immensely in place of traditional cookies. They are a bit pricy but they create a "full" feeling that helps you curtail eating too many (and since they are thin you get quite a few in your 10.5 ounce package).  We are looking forward to trying some of the other flavors and if you are looking for a change from your everyday cookie this is a nice option and appealing to kids and adults.

review/text: As with the blueberry version, these essentially taste like crispy muffins. The taste is strong on the cranberry and not overly sweet (probably due to the lack of partially hydrogenated corn crapola). That said, I did have them approved by a kindergartner -- it's not that they aren't sweet at all.  While I wouldn't exactly call this a health food, it's not too bad in that department for a snack food without artificial sweeteners. The only downside is that at nearly twenty bucks for 4 bags, they're kind of pricey. I slightly prefer the blueberry version, but that's a matter of personal taste -- both are good.

review/summary: Good Cookies but Palm Oil is a Concern
review/text: Recently, I tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FELBH8">Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey</a> cookies.  Then someone brought a package of the Cranberry type to work.  I like the cranberry cookies better.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are good. They are thin, but that was the idea, wasn't it? The cookies have a nice texture. You can taste the cranberries. The calorie count, 140 for three cookies, is about the same as the granola bars that I sometimes snack on. Just don't eat the whole box at once.<br /><br />The ingredients are also reasonable with the exception of the use of palm oil. As palm oil use has increased dramatically over the past ten years, commercial growers have been clearing rain forests in Indonesia and Malaysia to create palm oil plantations. The palm oil is used in food production, as in these cookies, and in the manufacture of bio-fuels. The result is a loss of endangered species and ironically increased carbon emission. There has been some movement to either reduce palm oil use or use only palm oil from sustainable sources. There have even been stories of girl scouts agitating to sell only palm-oil-free cookies.<br /><br />Kraft is aware of the palm oil situation. It is not clear that they are doing anything about it. This is from a July 15, 2009 Wall Street Journal article: "Kraft spokesman Richard D. Buino said that while the company supports the RSPO's [Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil] efforts, 'it is clear more work is needed to consolidate standards, enforce principles, verify traceability along the supply chain and ensure competitive pricing to bring certified palm oil to market. We're monitoring the RSPO process and actively engaging our suppliers to monitor their certification efforts to find viable options for sourcing sustainable palm oil.' Neither Nestl&eacute; nor Kraft directly addressed purchases of Malaysia's certified palm oil."

The label trumpets that it contains whole grains, but be aware that regular flour and sugar are the first two ingredients, and whole wheat comes in third, and fiber content is quite low, so there isn't a lot of whole wheat here.  These taste OK; my wife liked them a lot, but I ate them only because they were sitting on the table.  The picture on the box showing lots of bits of cranberries was pretty optimistic; there usually aren't that many bits of fruit in them.

Fairly reasonable stats for a cookie (140 calories, 5 grams of total fat and 7 sugars)---until you see that is only for THREE cookies.  No way you're going to hold yourself to 3 lousy cookies in one sitting so you'd better plan on doubling that.  But it is still a better choice that a lot of offerings in the cookie isle.  And that is just where I'd go to purchase these.  They didn't hold up well in shipping and I wound up with a lot of crumbs.  Which I ate anyway.  Because they were too yummy to let that stop me.

review/text: First, a couple of minor negatives with these cookies.<br /><br />First is the name. For years Nabisco advertised, "A cookie is just a cookie, but Newtons are fruit and cake." Why the Nabisco marketing gurus would think that it was a good idea to associate the "Newtons" name with these thin, crisp cookies is beyond me.<br /><br />Next is the packaging. The trend today is toward recycled-content paperboard packaging, such as the one Nabisco used for their new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LA1LKI">Ritz Crackerful Multigrain Crackers</a>. These cookies come in a foil-lined bag with a plastic liner, neither of which can be recycled.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are quite good. They have a light texture similar to that of a shortbread or butter cookie. There is a nice light orange flavor that is not overpowering. As is often the case when you use dried fruit in a cookie, the cranberries are a bit chewy. I thought these go best with a beverage. Tea, coffee, soft drink, and even (according to Mrs. Boilermate), wine. We both agreed these are "adult" cookies.

review/summary: A cookie cranberry Newton
review/text: These are a different type of cookie, and also come in some other flavors than cranberry - blueberry, fig and honey, and raspberry chocolate. The dough is like the dough in a fig Newton only crisper, except after the humidity gets high, when nothing is crispy. They taste very good although there was no trace of the labeled citrus; and not an extreme amount of cranberry either.<br />They were a hit in this family and we will purchase them in the future as an alternative to more sugar laden cookies. Three cookies are considered a serving with 149 calories and 8 g. of whole grain per serving. They can serve as a quick grab and go breakfast or as a more wholesome snack.

review/summary: Delicious but Missing Something
review/text: At my title says...these ARE good cookies/crackers/biscuits but there is something missing. First of all, when I think of "Newton" I think of the familiar cookies which have a moist and fruity taste.  Obviously these are "thins" and less calorie, but they lack something I expect of a "Newton."  The packaging makes me think more of a "Wheat Thin" and maybe it is subconscious, but this does taste like a Wheat Thin version of a cookie!  It is mildly moist, almost dry...but not quite.  It is enjoyable, and the fact that one can eat three of these for "1 serving" is a plus.<br />  All in all this is something I would imagine munching on during a high tea, not my usual snack.  It is good, but is only disappointing when one considers who the manufacturer is.

review/summary: Very Tasty and Crunchy
review/text: I want to call these cookies, but they aren't, quite. Nabisco calls them "Thins". Okay, they are very thin, so I guess that is the most appropriate term.<br /><br />My thins arrived from Amazon in rather poor shape. At least half of the cookies were smashed beyond belief. I rescued a half dozen large pieces to try and threw out the rest.<br /><br />I can almost tell you exactly what they tasted like if you ever ate Fig Newtons. I found it very interesting that the crispy cookie parts tasted just like the cake part of a Fig Newton, with crispness gone wild. They are very crisp!!<br /><br />Apparently embedded in the newtony stuff is the fruit parts. They looked like dried fruit. Mine was cranberry citrus. Frankly, I didn't expect much, but I was really wowed. The thins, cookies, whatever, ended up being very tasty.<br /><br />Would I recommend this product? Depends. I would personally not buy them again. I would myself buy the old fashioned Fig Newtons. I just really liked them. I eat very little sugar these days, so what I eat has to count, meaning really work for me. These do not fulfill that requirement, but for a lot of people I suspect they would.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: These Newton Fruit Thins are delicious!! They are not overly sweet or tart but just right with a pleasant taste of cranberries combined with a slight crunch. They are definitely one of my favorite cookies.<br /><br />For a cookie, I think that they are healthier than average because they are made with whole grains and do not contain high fructose corn syrup.

review/summary: Mild and Understated
review/text: There's nothing wrong with being "mild and understated." None of the tastes in this treat jump out at you but, instead, they're a good blend of several flavors and textures. My first impression was that I needed to get me a glass of milk since they're a tad dry, but not terribly so. I was expecting a cookie and these really aren't. They aren't as sweet as a cookie and that was a crowd-pleaser among my friends. They're a terrific, light snack, with an interesting taste.

review/summary: Tasty, light cookies!
review/text: I was never a big fan of fruit Newton cookies, so I was a bit wary of these. I do, however, love cranberry citrus sweets, so I gave Newtons Fruit Thins a chance. They're, as the name suggests, thin cookies with a nice bit of crunch to them, but they're not hard at all. They have a hint of sweetness without being too sweet, and the citrus gives them a nice bit of tartness. The dried cranberries add a good, chewy texture to the crispy cookie. These are great to keep on hand when you want something a little bit sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Yum!

review/summary: A healthy little snack that actually tastes good!
review/text: Hi!<br />Thee are a new entry by Nabisco - instead of the thick and soft fig newtons (and later other flavors), they have gone in different direction with these. These are crisp thin cookies, (more like a wafer) with real fruit bits in them. They are a nice size for a cookie about 3" each, so these are not a tiny cookie -- just thin! (about 1/8" thick) They do NOT use High Fructose corn syrup and each serving (3 cookie as 8G. of whole grain<br /><br />While the cookies themselves are nice and crisp, the fruit still has a nice fruity chew to it, and give them a nice balance.<br /><br />Ok.. the rundown -<br />Serving size<br />3 cookies - 130 cal, 45 from fat.<br />8 G. of Whole Grain per serving<br />22G Carb<br />1G Fiber<br />7G Sugar<br />Total Fat 5G (Sat. fat 1g 0 Trans Fat, 2.5g PolyUnsat. fat, 1.g Momounsat. fat)<br />Sugars 7g<br /><br />They are Made in Canada.<br /><br />On the whole, I like them, these are a good alternative, and they are crisp enough to have with tea. I tried the Cranberry Citrus, they also come in other flavors (like blueberry) which I am sure taste just as good!<br /><br />Jim

review/summary: Nice Snack Cracker
review/text: Nabisco Cranberry Citrus Oat flavored Newton Fruit Thins is a pleasing new snack. The bits of dried cranberry are nice and the texture and flavor of the "thin" itself is pleasant, somewhat reminiscent of a graham cracker. One of the best things about this product is that the sweetness is not overpowering. The ingredients are not especially offensive, even though this reviewer has an, admittedly, semi-unreasoning prejudice against any sweetener where fructose is part of the name, in this case simply "fructose." I am not much of a sweet eater or a consumer of highly processed foods, so I find the name "Newtons" somewhat puzzling. It is suspected that the flavor and texture of the "thin" itself is supposed to taste like the outer layer of a Fig Newton. I also understand modern branding, and this "thin" comes close enough. All-in-all this is a nice little snack and I recommend it. This review cannot end without my mentioning that my roommate enjoyed these. Were this product to become regularly available locally, it would be a staple in this household.

review/summary: Great! I like them just fine but my ex LOVED them
review/text: OK OK so I admit when my ex asked for something sweet (waiting for the kids to be ready) I offered up these cookies. I thought they were pretty good - but not terribly outstanding. He's very picky. VERY. So I *might* have had a thought * a teeny one* that I could give him some of these instead of heading off to my stash of M and M's and other scrumptious goodies - because, you know, feeding my ex is not something I do very often. He is an ex after all. However I try to be agreeable to get along.<br /><br />Lo and behold he positively loved them. Imagine my surprise when he gave me the container back, EMPTY, and said "Thanks". So yeah Newton's people..way to go..now my ex will be asking for food everytime he comes over!<br /><br />I compromised on the rating - I'd of said 3 because I liked them - but for my ex clearly these were a 5. Too bad he didn't get the same rating as a husband!

review/summary: I shall call these... crookers. That is, part cookie, part cracker.
review/text: With the density and shape of a cookie and the fragility of a cracker, it's an interesting combination. They have a shortbread-like consistency, a cranberry chewiness, and a bit of oatmeal flavor as well. Each time I open the box (which has re-sealable tabs I've never seen before), I get a waft of fruitiness. I'm hooked!<br /><br />The ingredients aren't listed on the product page, so I had to seek them out elsewhere. These cookies are dairy-free, and it appears they may even be vegan.<br /><br />UNBLEACHED ENRICHED FLOUR (WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, REDUCED IRON, THIAMINE MONONITRATE (VITAMIN B1), RIBOFLAVIN (VITAMIN B2), FOLIC ACID), SUGAR, WHOLE GRAIN WHEAT FLOUR, SOYBEAN AND/OR PALM OIL, ROLLED OATS, DRIED CRANBERRIES, FRUCTOSE, SALT, BAKING SODA, SOY LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVOR.<br /><br />Allergens and Nutritional Considerations: Added Sugars, Gluten, Soy, Wheat

review/summary: Tastes yummy, but where did nutrition go?
review/text: Cranberry Citrus Oat Newton Fruit Thins<br /><br />These are very pleasant.  They are similar to a graham cracker but they are a littly chewier and sweetier (though not extremely sweet).  The citrus and cranberry flavors are a very good combination.  We have purchased more.<br /><br />What disappointments me is the nutrition information.  I expect something with cranberries and citrus to have a little more nutritional value than this.  4% Iron and 1% Potassium is all the vitamin and mineral content described (unless you want to count Sodium, which thankfully is only 4%).  Where did vitamin C go -- the heat probably killed it, right?  The ingredients list B vitamin enrichment but the nutritional information doesn't list it leaving me wondering with the vitamins were killed by heat in the cooking process (in which case why bother) or whether they just think no one cares that they are there (we do, but I have to believe it isn't there since it isn't listed in the nutritional information).

review/summary: Delicious and a relatively healthy snack
review/text: Made with whole grains, these fruit thins are a relatively healthier choice if you're looking to satisfy a sweet tooth.  They have a crunchy, crumbly texture.  The taste is something like a butter cookie/ animal cracker/ nilla wafer, with a hint of refreshing orange flavor, and chewy pieces of cranberry sprinkled throughout.  It was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, but they were also enjoyed by my husband, who typically isn't that fond of sweets.  The sweet taste of the cookie contrasts nicely with the very subtle tartness of the cranberries.  It was nice to enjoy something other than the same old, same old cookies, and these disappeared quickly in our house!

review/summary: Impressive for a low-calorie cookie
review/text: Three of these cookies are 140 calories, but more importantly, since I'm perpetually on diet, these actually taste good.  They remind me of shortbread cookies, even having a somewhat buttery taste, but you don't get the calories, plus, OMG, they don't even have any cholesterol.  Unbelievably to me, three of these cookies supposedly provide 4 percent of your daily iron.  Of the ingredients that I can pronounce, they are made with unbleached enriched wheat flour, sugar (no wonder they taste good), soybean and/or palm oil, rolled oats, whole grain wheat flour, dried cranberries (which are plentiful and will get stuck in your teeth), fructose, salt, and baking soda.  If you are in search of the 100-calorie snack that satisfies, this one will.  I was also thinking that crumbled up, these would make an excellent cream pie crust, but ... !

review/summary: Surprisingly Tasty!
review/text: I have, in the past bunch of years, tried many different breakfast/snack bars/squares/thins. Even those that I find tasty usually turns tiring and stale - in short, no staying power.  I tried this new Newtons Fruit Thins and it is surprisingly good. It has a consistency of graham crackers (maybe not as crunchy - it's made partly with whole grain), but with a mildly sweet taste of cranberries.  It's not too heavy or sugary and not too plain, like saltine crackers.  I've tried it for a few days now and I have not gotten tired of taste yet. In the world of snack food, this is a little gem. No high fructose or corn syrup to boot.

review/summary: Good cookie
review/text: The best way I can describe the taste of these cookies is that they are very similar to the flavor of the Starbucks Cranberry scone that you would buy in their stores.<br /><br />Strong cranberry notes, sweet but not too sweet, hint of citrus, and sort of a crunchy yet fibery texture. The texture is like someone crossed a Girl Guides Peanut Butter cookie with a shortbread cookie.  Additionally some chewiness is added by the cranberry pieces  which seem right in proportion (not too much, not too few).<br /><br />This isn't an indulgence cookie, more of what I would call a snack or breakfast cookie.  Tasty if this is what your looking for in a cookie.

review/summary: The ultimate cracker cookie
review/text: Is it a cracker?  Is it a cookie?  Is it a Newton?  The correct answer?  All of the above!  I was surprised at the amount of flavor in the Newtons Fruit Thins.  Perfect with coffee or on the go, these tasty treats are perfect for that pick me up snack at any time of day.  A serving of three Fruit Thins is 140 calories, so this is really a better choice than most of those pre-packaged "100 calorie" snacks.  I would give this snack five stars, but like one of the photos demonstrates, many of the crisps had broken in transit.  All in all, a great crispy, sweet treat.

review/summary: Not really a huge fan of these
review/text: I ended up bringing these in to work to sample & my coworkers (who are able to sniff out treats a mile away) ended up eating some as well. The overall consensus was that these were "OK" but generally most didn't really care too much for these. My opinion is as follows:<br /><br />PROS: Healthier than eating some of the other cookies on the market, has a decent taste when it's present.<br /><br />CONS: The cranberry was a little too chewy at times, which was kind of a little annoying. Even worse than that is occasionally the cookies were pretty bland tasting. I don't know if I got a bad batch or if it's just me, but these just didn't have a lot of flavor. (However, the blueberry ones I also got to try had a lot of flavor, so it's possible I just got an underseasoned batch.)<br /><br />These weren't horrible, but I don't think I'll be putting my own money towards this flavor anytime soon. When the cookies had a flavor I could taste, they were pretty good. It's just that these were sort of bland tasting that makes me not really like them as much. I might give them another chance somewhere down the line, but offhand I'm going to stick to the blueberry flavor. These were just "OK" & that's about all I can say for them.

review/summary: C+ Concensus on Crispy Cranberry Cookie
review/text: First impression: meh. I sampled a few more, and the flavor kind of grew on me. You can taste all the ingredients you're supposed to notice--oats, cranberries, a little hint of citrus. Then I tried it with my coffee, and it was GOOD.<br /><br />I think that's the key--other reviewers have noted that tea or coffee goes great with this snack. It's not something you can mindlessly shove into your mouth while watching reality shows, not that I ever do that, but if you need a little treat in the afternoon, it's tasty with a cup of joe.<br /><br />The cranberries made this chewy, which was a nice combination (like pinwheel cookies). Putting two textures together can be tricky, and if not done correctly, is a real turn-off for me. But here the crunchy/chewy textures enhance each other.<br /><br />My family tasted these, as well. One of my kids liked the cookie but thought the calorie count a little high for a serving of three (140 calories). Not a big deal, but if you're going for the health-conscious crowd, that may be a little too steep. Other household members said these cookies were average, but then they lean toward big gooey chocolate desserts.<br /><br />So try these--but don't forget to fire up Mr. Coffee first.

review/summary: The Next Fruit Fusion
review/text: When it has came down to the newtons family over the years, they've really made some fantastic cookies and snacks over the years, from fig newtons to blueberry. For their latest products, they've decided to make it thin cookies. But is the taste strong with this one, yes and no. The new Newtons Fruit Thins, Cranberry Citrus Oats taste pretty good. It has a simple blend of cranberry, with the mist of orange into the taste of the cookie. While it does taste good, I do honestly wish that there was more zest into the cookies, but it is better than most lackluster snacks that've came out recently. Hopefully, there can be a more newtons cookies like this soon.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: B 1/2-<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-

They said it was like chewing on a sucker. Most liked the crispness of it. Ones who liked the Newton bars didn't like the thins as much and ones who didn't like the bars liked the thins better.<br />Overall, I would have to say it was a good cookie. Most of the group came back for more than one. It's a nice light treat.

review/summary: Oatmeal with a Touch of Fruit
review/text: My first impression was of oatmeal cookie and a little like a shortbread cookie.  The cookies are pretty flat (1/8" thick) but dense. The fruit tastes like dried fruit so you get a taste of chewy cranberry fruit in between the cookie taste. I'll post the nutrition information above but there are about 45 calories per cookie and about a third of those calories are from fat. Probably the most notable thing about these cookies are how filling they are. After 3 or 4 cookies I feel satisfied. A good snack before or after a workout. The label says "cranberry citrus oat" and I can't help but think that the addition of a little orange zest/peel would make these even better. I'll try the fig flavor next since that's what I think of when I see "Newtons" on the label.

review/summary: Too Many Broken Cookies and Fruit Too Chewy
review/text: Received this product and upon opening the package, I found over 30 percent of the cookies or fruit thins broken. They were broken into two pieces and some were smashed into many pieces. I found the taste to be OK, but the fruit content was of the consistency of "gummy bears" and tended to be excessively chewy and to stick to my teeth. The product had a sugary taste and a crumbly consistency. The Thins were easily broken. This is not a product that I would purchase again. Other Nabisco cookie products and the famous Fig Newtons are superior in flavor and durability. The packaging was not strong enough to protect the product. You can see images which I will post on the main product page.<br />Thin and easily broken product ought to be packaged in stronger boxes and not in flimsy plastic trays and paper bags. I gave a 2 star rating because of mediocre taste, poor mouth feel and flimsy packaging.  But, in fairness, the Vine product was shipped as an individual bag inside a larger shipping box with only two pieces of bubble pack so it is possible it rattled around and pieces of cookies broke.  The full size multi-pack that one would receive on a regular order should not suffer as much in transit.

review/text: This delicious goodness comes directly to us from a name we've grown to love. Nabisco!<br /><br />Remembering the gooey rich flavor of Fig Newton's when growing up, I simply had to discover if something with the name "Newtons" could be as good!<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Newtons Fruit Thins are absolutely amazing!<br /><br />As part of the Amazon Vine program, I received the Cranberry Citrus Oat cookie thins. When paired with either hot tea or coffee, these little bites of goodness absolutely came alive! Pleasant also was the fact that 3 cookie crisps were 140 calories, 22g of carbs, 5g fat, 2g of protein and a low 95mg of sodium! That makes these the perfect snack for the dieter or weight watcher as well as those who can liberally imbibe in them!<br /><br />Each package contains about 30 cookie crisps.<br /><br />Best of all? Even the grandchildren love 'em!<br /><br />I highly recommend these for your next coffee date or tea!<br /><br />****DISCLOSURE: As a member of the Amazon Vine program, I was provided with product for review.

review/summary: Tasty New Newtons
review/text: When you say newton,I think of fig newtons, the cake like concotion with the fig filling.  These cookies bear no resemblance to their softer anscesters. Thin and crisp they are studded with dried cranberries.  The tang of the cranberries is delightful against the orange crisp.  Made with oats and whole grains, they are not too sweet and surprisingly refreshing.<br /><br />The cookies are placed in a plastic tray in a foil lined bag with an attached wire tie.  They stayed crisp after opening.  There are about thirty cookies to a package.  My package arrived with about four cookies broken into pieces.<br /><br />I have been trying to integrate more whole grains and fruit into my diet and this is an easy way to do it.  Light, crispy and tasty they provide a refreshing respite from the super sugary gook that populates grocery shelves.  While not health food, they are certainly a healthier alternative.  I would buy again.

review/summary: Tasty but Those Troublesome Dried Fruit
review/text: Envision [whole grain] animal cracker cookie dough with dehydrated cranberries mixed into it. Now, shape into oversized Ritz cracker shapes and bake. That nails down my impression of both texture and flavor on these - whole grain animal crackers with cranberries. I suppose I can detect that citrus essence on the crackers upon placement on the tongue as well.<br /><br />So I do find these edible...kind of tasty too when I've got the craving. I'm not too crazy about the occasional dehydrated cranberry getting stuck behind my back teeth though - that's really my only negative about these otherwise well-flavored thins.

review/summary: A low-sugar, high-flavor snack. I'm in love!!!!!!
review/text: I am always on the lookout for a pre-bedtime snack that won't load me up with sugar or caffeine. These are actually pretty large, so if you eat just half a serving (1.5 wafers), you've got only 3.5 grams of sugar and 70 calories. Just enough to make you feel satisfied and keep you away from the box of Oreos.<br /><br />The taste is great---just a tad sweeter than a cracker, with chopped up dried cranberries to add some interest to the texture (and again, to make you feel like you are having more of a dessert than a cracker, so your mind doesn't scream for ice cream).<br /><br />These are obviously drier than fig newtons, so you'll probably want a glass of milk or a cup of tea. I can't wait to try the other flavors. Heavenly!!!

review/summary: Lighty Sweet, Crisp/Chewy at the Same Time, and Great for Kids
review/text: When I first heard about Newtons Fruit Thins, I was under the impression that these cookies would be soft like the traditional Newtons.  However, these Fruit Thins are nice and crunchy without being hard, and have little chewy bits of dried cranberries sprinkled throughout.  The taste was hard for me to pinpoint at first - it doesn't really taste citrusy - the closest thing I can compare it to is to a non spiced gingerbread.  It may seem bland to some people, however, I found that the lightly sweet taste was just right for me - I'm not particularly fond of overly sweetened cookies. If I had a choice of choosing between these and the traditional Newtons, I would definitely pick these!<br /><br />The best part about Newtons Fruit Thins is that they're great for kids.  My two toddlers couldn't get enough of these cookies!  Both of them love dried cranberries and crunchy snacks, and I love the fact that when they ate it, it didn't crumble and get bits and pieces of cookie everywhere.  Two cookies were about enough for each of them.  When paired with a glass of milk and some apple slices, it made for a nice snack!<br /><br />The bag is easily resealable, and there are lot of these cookies in there...but they will go fast!  Highly recommended!

review/summary: GREAT tasting cookie, deceiving name.
review/text: I've never reviewed a food before. So this'll be really interesting. I'm going to start by saying that these cookies are DELICIOUS. I'm always nervous of fruit in cookies because it can often be really rubbery and gross, but Fruit Thins have just the right amount of real fruit and graham-cookie base to be absolutely wonderful. I can't get enough of them! Which bring me to my next point:<br /><br />Just because Nabisco has called these FRUIT THINS, you should not be deceived. Just to check, I compared a serving of Fruit Thins (30g) to a serving of Chips Ahoy classic cookies (32g).<br /><br />CHIPS AHOY:<br />Calories: 160<br />Fat: 8g<br />Sugars: 10g<br />Protein: 2g<br />Vitamin A: 0%, C: 0%, Calcium: 0%, Iron: 4%<br /><br />FRUIT THINS:<br />Calories: 140<br />Fat: 5g<br />Sugars: 7g<br />Protein: 2g<br />Vitamin A: 0%, C: 0%, Calcium: 0%, Iron: 4%<br /><br />So for certain, Fruit Thins have less fat, calories, and sugar. But a lot? No. Just because the cookies are called Fruit THINS, don't be thinking that you won't gain weight if you're constantly snacking on them. Like everything, they should be eaten in moderation. The cookies themselves are very thin (perhaps that's what the name refers to) but they are still COOKIES.<br /><br />I'll end by repeating that these are DELICIOUS. The cranberry citrus flavor adds a wonderfully original spark to the classic graham cookie. If you're looking for treat that you can feel [a little bit] less guilty about eating, this is the one for you.<br /><br />And now I'm off to eat a few.

review/summary: A solid home-run!
review/text: I grew up on the Classic Fig Newtons and still love them to this day. These Newtons take the soft, chewy fruit cookie in the opposite direction with the perfect amount of snap and crunch. The combination of cranberry and citrus with vanilla/oat overtones make a delicious combination. My favorite way to enjoy these is with a cup of coffee. I think they have a new classic on their hands. Can't wait to try the other flavors.

review/summary: great low calorie margarita
review/text: I love margaritas, but I hate all the calories. Was excited to hear about the new Skinny margarita by Bethenny.  Tried it, and UGH--so disappointing.  If you like really salty tasting drinks, then you will like it, but it didn't taste like a margaria to me, and it was very salty.  Next I tried the skinny cal-o-rita and was so pleasantly surpised!  No salty taste--a little tart, but I had mine with lots of ice, used tequila to mix it with, and it was delicious!  For such a low calorie yummy cocktail, I am hooked.  Am ordering more right now.

review/summary: Artificial yucky taste!
review/text: I have been using sugar alcohols and stevia is various things for a while now. When I saw this online with all the great reviews I was so excited. However, when I received the product and tried it, I was gravely disappointed. It tastes artificial with lots of aftertaste. In my opinion, it does not in anyway taste like sugar. I did appreciate the small packet to try it before I wasted all that tequila in the powder and water as instructed. I thought there was such high shipping cost because it was a liquid and then what a surprise when I got it that it is a powder in an empty bottle. I would never have ordered it if I knew that upfront. I really want to return it but because it was such a large cost for shipping and then I have to pay the shipping back, it would really not be worth it so I'll just suck it up and throw it away!!!

review/text: I have not had any of this tea yet as it only arrived today. I was told by the company that I would receive a ten percent pay back if I left feedback. It was packaged pretty, however, it is NOT a lot of tea and it was expensive, especially considering the shipping and handling. I am going to be one ticked off mommy if this tea does NOT alleviate the itchiness that I am getting from eczema as that is my SOLE reason for ordering this product. If if doesn't I will be back to amend this review.

review/summary: Convenient, healthy
review/text: My 8 month old son loves these. I keep one in my purse at all times. He is breastfeed and we make his other solid foods (cook, puree and freeze)--but this is what I use when we're out so that I don't have to worry about microwaving or his fresh food going bad from being out too long. He really likes this flavor and I'm happy because it includes three foods that I haven't been making for him. I'm trying to introduce him to all the fruits and vegetables that are OK for him to eat at this age, and I'm hoping that eating the spinach in this will make him less likely to reject it later... Only downside that I can think of is that these are rather watery. Not sure if that is solved if you move to the Stage 3 ones.

review/text: If you want/need convenience, this item is fabulous!  We always rate the organic baby food pouches high and our only concern is the price.  We find the pouches great for taking to restaurants, in the car, on picnics, to the zoo, etc.  Also, it continues to be an easy way to get super foods into our toddlers without the preparation of the fruits and vegetables!  We still keep them on hand even after the baby food days are gone.

review/text: My 9 month old started eating this flavor at about 7 months old and loves it!  She isn't really a picky eater, but she likes some things more than others.  When its time for the spinach/mango/pear she takes one tastes then asks for more!  I've tasted it, its pretty good.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the consistency is a bit watery and difficult to keep on the spoon when feeding the baby.  I'd love it if they just didn't puree it quite as much or didn't add quite so much water, then it would be perfect.

I have talked to customer service and they had complains from other people and the next batch will have more sweet potato in so it should taste better. I will give it try again when the new batch is out. Otherwise my son loved all the other flavors we tried so far ( pear, mango&spinach&pear, Pear&peas&broccoli, apple&cherry, banana&beat&blueberries ). So try one before ordering bunch on Amazon.<br />The pouch idea is great, so easy to travel with! Some of the flavors are little runny but I am using Boon spoon and it works great. I am also going to try out the Plum organic Boon spoon for pouches, should fit Happy baby pouches as well.

My baby is starting solids now and she likes this one too.
