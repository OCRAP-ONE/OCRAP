review/summary: Instant portion control in a tasty snack package
review/text: When I was looking for a great after work snack or something to get me through until meal time, I decided to try these snack pack "Gripz" and see what they were all about.  I am glad that I did!<br /><br />Not only are they very convenient (my only gripe is with the tear-off corner that sometimes does not come cleanly), they taste great!  All three flavors are good - I enjoyed the grahams the best.<br /><br />If you are looking for something for the kid's lunchbag or your own, desire a convenient package and smaller portion, I suggest that you give these a shot!

review/summary: Mmmm, brown rice
review/text: Actually that is not what I said the first time I tasted brown rice.  But, is the best brown rice I've ever had, it is probably half as chewy as other cheaper varieties.<br /><br />If you've never had brown rice before, it is CHEWY. You ever have steel-cut oats?  Well, brown rice is chewier, even this premium brand.  But that very quality is the strength of this whole grain, which is the extra fiber and vitamins not found in polished rice.<br /><br />What I do now is mix 1/3 brown, 2/3 white rice.  That way you get the benefits of the brown and taste of the white rice.  It lasts a long time that way as well.

review/text: I got these (not a 2-pack) but 1 for $8.94 locally. So even with the Prime Membership it's still overpriced. Two of these would have been $17.88 which makes it a $4.12 difference. Unless you're spending more than that for gas to drive to the local japanese market, I recommend this rice. It cooks well and retains the nice balance of texture moist-wise. Lungberg sucks and even with added water to my rice cooker still comes out badly.

I highly recommend this product because it cheaper than buying one bag of weight formula and one bag of hair ball formula.<br />I buy 6 pack of food every 6 months so it equals to about $7 a month on cat food.<br />For this high quality cat food Amazon has the best price. I give 5 stars to Amazon and the Purina One Cat Food Hairball & Healthy Weight Formula.

review/summary: Cat that NEVER vomited has been vomiting daily since formula change
review/text: This used to be one of the relatively few "urinary tract" formulas out there that my cat could stomach AND was readily available at most super markets but since the recent formula change, he has been throwing up nearly every day and has started turning his nose to it. It's pretty awful and kind of scary to see him lose half of his "nourishment" every day of late. This was something he had been eating every year for the last decade (half mixed with a high-end catfood that is only meat and poultry and none of the grains and corn crap that is so bad for humans and completely counter to what cats naturally eat!).  So now I am at a loss.  I wish there was a grocer's catfood out there on the store shelves that is all meat and poultry, no sugars, no grains and no corn and has the urinary tract ingredients for these little creatures that have this problem.  I wonder if just feeding him the food he would be eating in the wild would change things around--even for the urinary tract complications...anyway, the Purina Urinary Tract Formula is no longer any good.

review/summary: Caution: Made my cat very sick!!
review/text: I've been feeding my cat this food for years without a problem. Recently she began vomiting uncontrollably after eating the food. Around her feeding time, she was at her bowl crying an begging for food like she usually does, but when we fed her she refused to touch the stuff. We thought maybe she just didn't have an appetite because she wasn't feeling well, but she scarfed down the treats and tuna we gave her. That was when we started to suspect that something was wrong with the food. We went out and bought her some canned food, and she ate that too. The only thing she wouldn't touch was the Purina food that she had eaten for years. She also stopped throwing up after we switched her food. After that, I turned to google to see if there were any recalls. I didn't find any, but I did find numerous complaints on the consumeraffairs dot com about cats (and dogs...apparently the problem isn't limited to cat food) who have recently gotten sick from Purina food. I would NOT buy this food. I have already stopped feeding it to my own cats, and I would suggest that everyone else do the same.<br /><br />If you pet has already gotten sick from the food, call this number to complain. 1-866-787-4621

review/summary: ~*~*~NO MORE URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS~*~*~
review/text: My cat is 10 years old and he used to get UTI's ALL the time(like every few months) not only was his vet bills expensive, I hated that he was in pain. I used the very expensive food I bought from the vet for cats who get lots of UTI's but since I am not Donald Trump I decided to give the Purina One Urinary Tract food a try. For years my cat didn't have a single UTI so one day at the store when they were out of the Purina One, I decided to give a cheaper Urinary Tract cat food a try. Within a month my cat was whining in the litter box and I knew he had another UTI. I took him to the Vet and sure enough, he had another UTI.<br /><br />I immediately went to the store and bought him Purina One Urinary Tract and that is what he has been on ever since. I will NEVER again try a different brand of cat food, that was over 4 years ago since I tried the cheaper cat food and he hasn't had a single UTI since. My cat LOVES his food, he is very picky but thankfully he loves his UTI formula.<br /><br />If you have a cat who gets UTI's I totally recommend giving this food a try. It costs more than the cheaper food but what it saves me in vet bills and having a happy & healthy Kitty is well worth it : )

review/summary: A decent price and quality
review/text: Its been almost a month since I switched my two cats over from Meow Mix to Purina Sensitive System. Both of them love it, and the older of the two cats has significantly vomited less after eating this food.<br /><br />I came to realize the poor quality of ingredients in Meow Mix, and hoped to find a better quality food for a good price, but its no surprise to me that even a good bag of dry cat food has some undesirable ingredients (corn gluten meal, chicken by-product, etc.) and its almost impossible to find anything of high quality without those ingredients and still be paying a decent price for it. The 3.5 lb bags I get at Target are about $6.00. Not too expensive, and the bag lasts my two cats a little over a month.<br /><br />Although Purina Sensitive Systems isn't the best ever, its not the poorest either. It falls just in the middle, and I'd recommend it to those who can only afford an inexpensive dry cat food, but with better quality than the cheaper Meow Mix brands.

review/summary: Much Healthier Cats Since Switching
review/text: I have two cats with chronic problems. Marci had chronic diarrhea. I took her to the Texas A&M pet clinic. Several tests were run to identify the cause. None of the tests results identified any problems. After I switched to Purina One, her diarrhea cleared with no recurring problems.<br /><br />My other cat, Beauty-Bells, suffered from recurring urinary tract infections. She has not one since eating Purina One. I have not had to buy the formula for urinary tract infections. The regular Purina One formulas have been sufficient.<br /><br />Being on a tight budget with 8 cats, I had long hesitated to switch to food that is so much more expensive. My cats actually eat less. They are also much healthier with shiny, soft coats and more energy. I switched 3 kittens to Purina one and the differences in health were obvious much quicker than with the older cats. I keep threatening to put them on cheaper food because they are tearing up my house with all the energy they have! Of course, I them to much to do that!<br /><br />The switch has been well worth it. Being so happy and amazed with results, I don't think I'll ever feed them anything else.

review/summary: Purina One Sensitive - great for a cat with digestion trouble
review/text: We recently took in a cat that could not keep any food down.  She would throw up multiple times a day, usually within an hour or so of eating.  We thought she may be overeating, so we limited how much food we gave her, we tried to spread out the food to force her to breath and chew between pieces.  We tried many different foods, including multiple foods recommended by the vet.  After a lot of money spent on vet visits and tests, with the vet finding nothing wrong with her, I saw this food and figured trying a food for sensitive systems couldn't hurt.<br /><br />We'd already tried other Purina One formulas without success, so we weren't particularly optimistic, but hopeful.  Our cat has been eating this for about two or three weeks now and she has not thrown up at all.  I love this food, it was hard to watch her throw up so much, and, frankly, it wasn't pleasant cleaning it up so frequently.  I'm glad I found this and fully recommend it to anyone with a cat with similar problems keeping food down.

review/summary: Life saver food
review/text: My little guy suffered two urinary blockages. For anyone who has gone through this knows how scary it is and EXPENSIVE it is to treat. My vet told me I could keep him on his regular food as he mainly eats wet food but I started feeding him Halo's cat food- the wet chicken formula since it's not as high in protein which caused part of his problem. This dry food is excellent for urinary health issues. My cat has not suffered another blockage since I have had him on this food regularly and he hasn't had anymore UTI's either which I am happy about and hope it continues. And the best part is he loves the food so I didn't have to worry about that either. They use real chicken in this food and there is no by product or fake crap. If you have a cat who suffers from FLUTD or UTI- give this food a try- it works geat!

review/summary: My two kitties love Purina One.
review/text: I have two cats.  They have eaten Purina One for six years now. Their coats are shiny and they both look healthy and have lots of energy. They are both eleven years old.  I started feeding them Purina One because the first ingredient on the label was chicken. There are also no artificial colors or flavors and unlike some pet foods it is manufactured in the United States. Those are enough reasons for me to choose this particular food. I think that even though Purina One is not the best of the best of cat foods, it is a good value for the price, and the cats love it. My male kitty will not eat anything else. A tip for anyone just introducing a new food to your kitty:  Introduce the food slowly by mixing just a little of the new food with the old food.  Increase the amount each time you feed the kitty eventually eliminating the quantity of the previous food.  This will help to alleviate any stomach upset that your kitty may experience from a new food.

review/summary: My cat's favorite dry food
review/text: I have a very picky older cat. She is probably extra picky because she's old and has trouble digesting some cat foods. This one though is her favorite dry food. She begs for it and waits by her bowl one hour before dinner. My other cat also gets very excited about this food. I've found with other foods that they get occasional hairballs, but with this one it's a very rare occasion for either of them to have a hairball- maybe once a year. Previously when I fed them the cute cat foods (like Meow Mix) half of the food would stay in the bowl and the older cat was particularly adept at separating out the shapes she didn't like.<br /><br />Although the price on Amazon is very competitive to buying single bags at the grocery store, I found that the 16 pound bag at Pet Smart goes on sale for $18.99 and the last bag I bought included a $5 Pet Smart gift card. If I only had one cat though I would definitely buy from Amazon for the convenience factor and the price is competitive with Tar get and other grocers.<br /><br />Both of my cats got shinier coats as well since making the switch to Purina One a few years ago. There are several formulas (in addition to this one) to meet your particular cats needs:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BEXBCS">Purina One Cat Food Sensitive System, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br />Purina One Cat Food Vibrant Maturity 7+ Senior Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BEXBAK">Purina One Cat Food Advanced Nutrition Hairball Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDI0QQ">Purina One Cat Food Salmon & Tuna Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDEI7G">Purina One Cat Healthy Weight Management, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDI0RA">Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BETMEO">Purina One Cat Food Chicken & Rice Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDI0RK">Purina One Cat Food Urinary Tract Health Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: Please make sure you buy this food in small quantities at first if you are unsure that your cat will like it. Our Russian Blue treats it like medicine because he hates the taste of it. He only eats it because we have been strict with his diet and refuse to give him much else besides the urinary formulated foods. We intend to stop buying this product completely.<br /><br />Our most effective food for him has been the Royal Canin Urinary Formula (you can only get it from the vet), as he loves it and it keeps his pH in check - however, it's $50 for a 7 lb bag. Not too pretty.<br /><br />We also tried the more expensive "Pro Plan" equivalent - and it is the same product in a different bag, which made it even worse. Both products do work (this one and the Pro Plan) but good luck trying to feed it!<br /><br />We now feed wet Friskies "Special Diet : Urinary pH" and our cats love it! It comes in beef, chicken, or (the best one) ocean whitefish. It's very affordable as well. Check it out.<br /><br />If you still decide to try this out, please please please buy a small bag first so you know your cat will not hate it!

Not only did the Eukanuba not work, but because the fiber content in it was so high, I had to change my litter boxes twice as often as I had to previously.<br /><br />This cat food has been a life saver for both of the cats I have with digestive issues.  It has reduced the number of times my cat throws up significantly, from a few times a week, to once or less (outside of normal hairballs).  The other cat with some litterbox issues have cleared up almost entirely.<br /><br />Well worth the money (which is far less on Amazon than any local pet store I've found).<br /><br />If you have a cat with a sensitive stomach, this is the answer.

review/summary: Kitties love it and a lot less expensive than the vet's
review/text: One of the kitties has a very sensitive tummy, and I had been spending quite a bit of money, not to mention the inconvenience of running to the vet's every couple of weeks to buy their "special" brand.  One day I noticed that Purina made the vet's brand, and started to wonder if they made a version sold in the grocer.  Sure enough, Sensitive Systems from the Purina One line was in the store.  I slowly transitioned the kitties to it without any ill effects.  Purchasing this on the regularly scheduled delivery not only lowered my costs, it is so convenient to come home and find it waiting on my doorstep!  I am really pleased with the Purina One brand.  The cats are healthy, and can't wait for me to get up in the morning to bring it to them.

review/summary: Beware! Not the product shown in picture!
review/text: Amazon, please update your picture for accurate product info.<br /><br />If you are looking for this product made with yogurt, this is NOT it despite what the picture shows. Purina has changed the recipe, and its hard to find the old formula that was made with yogurt. My cat has a sensitive stomach and has thrown up all foods we have tried besides the type made with yogurt. Now that the recipe has changed, he is throwing up daily again. I was so excited to see I could buy the yogurt version on AMAZON in bulk... till it arrived. This is not the product I wanted, the picture is very misleading considering their disclaimer says that all ingredients may not be listed on the site. Its on the picture so I thought I would get what I saw.

review/text: I began using this food as soon as my cats were off kitten food, mostly to *prevent* hairballs, and it worked! My cats are coming up on their 4th birthday (2 of them), and have not once ever had a hairball. I mix this food 2:1 with the sensitive systems food because one of my cats has digestive issues. I can't vouch for the taste myself, but the cats eat it!

Weight wise, I dont see his indoor life causeing weight gain so it must be helping there as well.  I wish the price was not so high, but on subscribe and save, I save money, and never run out.....

review/summary: Really Works, but be careful!
review/text: I've been drinking this for eight months now, and I can tell you, it really works!  I already had been exercising for a year--some strength training in the morning, some cardio at night, chasing two young kids all day.  I started taking this after a couple friends recommended it--one is a classmate and she used it to keep awake during boring lectures, another was my friend who runs marathons and used it to give himself a boost before a run.  Both were right.  I doubled my aerobic time (cardio kickboxing) within a week, felt better, and it even helped me focus.  (I have ADHD)  But beware, there is a side effect--if you go off of it, that is.  After a week or two off of it, I notice that I feel sluggish, depressed, I drag around.  Literally, my metabolism crashes.  Its not the caffeine, because I've tried coffee, it doesn't help.  I've had both the raspberry and the peach, I have to say I like the peach better, its a milder flavor.  I've used it both in hot tea and to make iced tea.  It really does work, just make sure you're ready for it!

review/summary: SOOO Much Energy
review/text: I have taken many, and I mean MANY, energy supplements over the years and this is the first one that has actually made me feel like I had an abundance of energy without making me jittery. I have tried everything from Red Bull, Monster, Mt. Dew's energy drink AMP, Coke's new Vault and even Jolt's new energy drink.  The only thing I got out of those was a short lived rush, the shakes and an extra roll of FAT around my belly with all the calories included with them.  This Tea Concentrate by Herbalife has 5 calories per serving but packs a ton of energy.  Plus it gives me something the others didn't...the added bonus of the metabolism boosting effects of green tea extracts!  So not only do I get extra energy I get to burn fat at the same time!  A+++ on this product... and I have never written a review for a product before.  I felt this warranted a good review from me!

review/text: I've tasted some slimming/fat burning/weight loss teas before and I have to say that this is the best one I've ever tasted.  The original flavor tastes like Nestea without the bad sugar.  I'm totally in love with it.<br /><br />I agree with the former 2 reviewers who said that the tea gives you an energy boost.  I usually feel sleepy at work in the afternoons and this is what keeps me awake.  I love the lemony, fruity, herbal scent.  This is a great tea to compliment those who are doing Yoga as well.<br /><br />I do not have that bloated feeling after I drink the tea.  I usually get a sour/acidic stomach if I consume about 3 cups of tea and I notice that this isn't the case with Herbalife's tea.  I have about 3-4 cups of a tea a day and so far, no acidic stomach.  It's amazing.

review/summary: OK... if you like mush!
review/text: Love the dry formula of this for my dog, but the canned is disgusting.  I have gotten many different flavors of the Natural Balance canned cat food and never does it have this consistency.  My poodle is doing great on the dry formula so I thought he would like the canned as well.  He couldn't even eat it unless I put some of the dry in with it because it was like soup.  I just checked the label and it is the same 78% moisture as is the cat food so I'm not sure what is wrong.  Plus, when I gave Joey just a tablespoon in his dry food, it made him sick.  The ingredients are so different than the dry and I don't understand that.  Why would they have such a variance in the ingredients of a food for sensitive dogs?!  Anyway, Joey loves the dry food and the Wellness salmon and rice both dry and canned.  Their canned is made with much more logic and has the same ingredients in a different order to make the canned.  That makes sense to me, not what Natural Balance has done with this.

review/summary: This stuff is awesome - VERY TASTY!
review/text: I bought the Ostrim with a little apprehension never having eaten any Ostrich meat.  After I had my first bite I KNEW I would be ordering more!  This is one of the best beef sticks (ok beef and Ostrich) that I have tasted, not only that it is very low calorie and high protein (which helps you feel full longer) and is all natural.  I'm not even half down with my first order and I already ordered a second batch.  This is just really good stuff, if you like beef jerky and beef sticks try this and you'll probably like it.  When you eat it the stick has a snap to it, tastes clean, not oily / greasy or fatty.  You taste just meat and before you know it you've eaten the whole thing and are thing about another.

review/text: I love these things. They are easy and you get a good amount of lean protein. However, the last two shipments have been dry. This is in stark contrast to the juicy and fresh ones that I have been getting for quite some time. I'm disappointed, and thinking of discontinuing my orders.

review/summary: Acquired taste and great when delivered fresh
review/text: This tastes nothing like a slim jim to me so for those that claim it does, either they haven't had one in a long while or their mind is tricking them.  Most of my friends get a whiff of it before they try it and turn it down.  I'm Asian and trust me half of our food doesn't look tasty or smell good, but is often very good.  I love these sticks.  I will admit they are probably going to be an acquired taste for some.  I've only bought the natural from amazon.  I tried some of the other flavors and found them a poor product.  Their additional flavors were in harsh contrast to the natural flavor of the ostrich meat so I can see how some would see it as a turn off.  My personal opinion though.<br /><br />Like a few other said, I don't like the inconsistency.  Sometimes the quality is good, sometimes not. I'm wondering if there are dips in the ostrich meat market where they have to sometimes use meat they normally wouldn't.  Or if they were left in bad conditions too long during transport.  If the saltiness and dryness were consistent each time, I'd be much happier.

review/summary: Teriyaki Flavor
review/text: Got to say when I bought these I was worried about the ostrich, not  going to lie.  When they arrived however they  tasted great, on top of that they're low in fat and great for protein.  This is the exact reason I bought them because I'm trying to lose the last few pounds while gaining muscle. The thing is though that I still think Jack Links tastes better.  Jack Links Slim Jims are high in fat however but on the other side there jerky is low in fat and on top of that around 20g of protein per pack. I gave this product a 5/5 because it was so low in calories and still tasted good but I will say when I finish off with this last bit of body fat then Ill probably switch over to Jack Links because the higher amount of protein. Still great product because it's healthier, 5/5 stars.

My favorite flavor is the original, followed by the peppered. This is also a great price per oz.

Honestly, one stick and piece of fruit is a substantial "snack" that keeps you full for a while.  It's great that Amazon offers them on ship and save - - makes the price really affordable, too!

review/summary: Addictive, healthy beef jerky
review/text: As I become more aware of the nutritional values in foods, I try to find a good balance between taste and nutrition.  Ostrim has done it with this product.  I love regular beef jerky, but wanted a lower fat/sodium snack.  At 60 calories per pack with 1.5 grams of fat and only 290 grams of sodium, I found the nutrition I wanted in my jerky.  The taste actually exceeded my expectations, yes it is lower in sugar and sodium, but it still has a good meaty flavor and is much like a lean cut of meat.  The pepper flavor is light, but compliments the meat instead of overpowering it. I have now been eating this jerky for over a year and still think it is a good "healthy" snack for when I have to have some jerky.

review/text: Finally, a high protein snack which really is just that- high protein, without excess fat or carbohydrate. VERY good for almost any diet, but especially for a low carb OR low fat diet. Require no refrigeration, easy to carry around, fairly easy to open. These sticks, at 1.5 oz., are larger than many similar products out there. One consideration- these are a bit higher in sodium than I would really like to see, though no higher than other similar products. The only problem I have had with these is eating too many! I have tried another flavor of these, and found the teriyaki flavor to be better.

review/text: I purchased an Ostrim High Protein Snack at a juice bar after the gym one day, because of its high protein/low carb/low fat properties, expecting it to taste like a stick of cardboard, and was surprised at how good it was. I purchased a second snack as a novelty item (Ostrich meat) for my teenager, who loves beef jerky, and was stunned when he thought it was delicious. I immediately ordered two cases of Ostrim from Amazon (MUCH cheaper than buying them retail), and now my son takes one to school everyday for a midday snack. Who knew there could be healthy beef jerky that tastes great?

review/text: These taste great, and are very low in fat compared to other beef sticks.  They are very low in calories, and most of the calories come from protein.  I have used these while hiking, and usually keep a few in my car for a healthy snack so I am not tempted to go get fast food.

review/text: These things are like crack. Seriously. I can't get enough. Forget about Slim Jims or regular beef jerky. These are the real deal. Great as a pre or post workout snack. I just wish they were cheaper so I could buy a year's supply right now!

review/text: I have to agree with the other reviewers! These are excellent and difficult to stop eating! I'm not even that fat and I want to eat the whole box in one sitting! What a great jerky snack!
