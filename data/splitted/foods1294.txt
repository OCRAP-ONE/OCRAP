review/summary: Not exactly what I ordered...
review/text: As another reviewer has noted, the product description was a bit misleading. I thought I was getting four 7oz jars of Alaskan Salmon Roe. What I received was six small 5oz tins of something purporting to be salmon roe. Most of the writing on the label is in Russian, but it does say "Product of USA." This is all a bit off-putting, as we were planning to give the jars as gifts. Now I guess I'll have to open one one to check things out. The can has a stamp indicating that it was packed only 2 week ago.<br />If the product inside is any good, I'll upgrade this by a star (to 4), if so-so I'll leave it at 3 or maybe 2. If bad, the minimum one star.

review/summary: Great for Seaweed Salad
review/text: This wakame, when hydrated, doesn't look like the long narrow strips I'm used to in restaurant seaweed salad. However the small(half-inch), squarish pieces do just fine as a good-tasting salad.  It's quite salty even after soaking, so would probably benefit from a rinse after soaking, before adding dressing.<br />The price was right, too!

review/summary: Buy this somewhere else. Not from anneeavon!!!
review/text: This tea is an excellent herbal tea. Love the taste and it's not as weak as most herbal tea is. I used to get it from the Commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so I checked on Amazon. Most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and I swear it said "and free shipping when ordered from this seller" above the "add to cart" button. I ordered last night and opened my e-mail this afternoon to find they charged me $8.49 shipping for each of the 3 boxes I ordered! And the estimated arrival time is a week away! For that kind of money I'd expect overnight. For that kind of money I could have gotten a couple cases and had change. It's probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products.

review/summary: Actual product is great, but ordering it from Amazon isn't.
review/text: I originally ordered erythritol directly from Emerald Forest and have fallen in love with it. For those familiar with xylitol, this is better in almost every way.<br /><br />It's nominally 70% as sweet as sugar. I find it slightly less sweet than xylitol, but my roommate finds it to be more sweet. It also has less of what I would describe as a "bite" to its sweetness than xylitol, especially in warm beverages.<br /><br />It doesn't have the upset tummy effect, since it doesn't seem to attack our symbiotic E. Coli. This does make it less interesting for anti-microbial applications, such as a nasal or oral/dental rinse. I still keep xylitol around for that.<br /><br />It works just fine in nearly all cooking. It even caramelizes. I haven't tried pushing my luck with yeast-leavened bread, however. My yeast still gets fed dextrose, with erythritol as a supplement for sweet doughs. If the yeast can't, in fact, metabolize the erythritol, this will make adjusting sweetness much easier when using a bread machine.<br /><br />Now the downsides. It does have about a fifth of a calorie per gram, which means a single packet is closer to 1 calorie than 0. It has much more of a "cooling" effect when dissolving even than xylitol. It's a bit time consuming to dissolve in iced tea, and I tend to need to "zap" my coffee in the microwave for a few seconds if it's not at just-brewed temperature.<br /><br />I've had one successful order from Amazon of this item and received the thousand-pack bulk box. My most recent order, however, turned out to be xylitol instead of erythritol. Fortunately, I'm not completely out of my first order yet. If actually getting the correct product is important, I'd say it's worth paying the extra money and ordering direct from Emerald Forest Sugar.

review/summary: Wish I could say it was better
review/text: Don't be dissappointed in your machine if this is the first T-disc flavor you've tried. It's not your Tassimo, it's the coffee blend. I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic "coffee". The "crema" is not much more than window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino.

review/text: I used to buy the "ice cream" flavor mix of Chupa Chups, they had chocolate, vanilla, banana, and strawberry cream(?).  I'm not a big fan of the fruit flavors.  The coffee and ice cream flavors are really unique and well done, the fruit flavors don't stand out that much from other brands of fruit flavored suckers.<br />I love the cappuccino and espresso flavors.  The mocha flavor is a little on the yucky side though.  It tastes like instant mocha coffee.  Since there are only 3 flavors, it's disappointing that one would be so undesirable.  My kids love them all though, so I just pick out the mochas for them.<br />These really are great lollipops for adults.  All the fun of a lollipop with grown up flavors.

But because these are low in calorie I don't feel guilty if I eat two packs.<br /><br />I didn't even look at expiration dates since I don't care and they're not going to last the month.<br /><br />I do wish they had this in all chocolate but the cinnamon is really good also.<br /><br />I'm really glad I got in on the subscribe and save before they closed it but the price went up.  I saw K-mart has these for $5.99/box which is better but it's worth it to have them delivered.  I don't know why the price hike.<br /><br />All I can say is Yum Yum!

I originally bought these in Sept 2011 for under seven dollars. 2 months later the price is over 14. Really?! I can appreciate inflation, but this kind of price increase is robbery!

review/text: Chocolate Teddy Grahams are so yummy!  As an adult, I love them.  I'd imagine kids would too.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- No high fructose corn syrup.<br />- Crunchy little bite-sized cookies.<br />- Nice chocolate taste that's not fake.<br />- Great to eat in the car, at your desk, or wherever.  It's a portable snack.<br />- Sweet but not sickeningly so.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I really have no cons other than they will get stale if you don't wrap the bag up tightly.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I enjoy Chocolate Teddy Grahams as either dessert, or a snack with a cup of coffee.  It's a sweet pick-me up that doesn't leave me feeling too guilty.  Cures the need for chocolate, and has a nice crunch that sometimes I really want.  Oh yeah, and they're cute little bears!

review/summary: Excellent dog food
review/text: My 3 dogs LOVE this kibble.  For years, my 12 year old male vizsla was on a raw food diet due to inflammatory issues when he was on kibble as a young dog but when we got a new puppy, decided to try switching him back to kibble.  In the past, when we tried feeding him any kind of kibble, including many very expensive, organic foods, within 3 days he would start to limp and become incapacitated.  This was not the case with any of the Natural Balance line of kibble.  He has done very well and his bloodwork improved as a result of being off raw and back on a good kibble.  My 2 year old female vizsla is very finicky and prefers this specific type the best.

Soybean product in conditioner?  I don't like the idea of soybeans in my conditioner.  Maybe that's why the hair didn't glow or was silky.  This conditioner might be good for some, but not for me.  Oh, it's usable if you don't have anything else, but I wouldn't buy it.  It could have gotten 3 stars, but the soybeans brought it down to one.

review/summary: Excellent product at a reasonable price!
review/text: I received a bottle of Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner to review. I was not able to get a bottle of the shampoo, so I had to try this after my regular shampoo. I have been coloring and bleaching my hairs for many years and it tends to be dry and brittle.<br /><br />To evaluate the condition, I used the following criteria:<br />- Does it get the knots out? Yes, excellent!<br />- Does it leave my hair too oily or too dry? I liked the way my hair felt after I used the conditioner,<br />- Does my hair style properly after I use it? Yes, I had no trouble styling my hair.<br />- Does it have a pleasant smell? I liked the smell a lot!<br />- Does the bottle sit firmly on the tub (I often leave the lid open and knock it over!) It has a large, flat surface that keeps the bottle upside down for easy removal.<br />- Is the price reasonable? The price is $4.79 for a 12.7 oz. Bottle. VERY reasonable!<br /><br />I liked this conditioner so much that I went to the store and bought the shampoo. After using both, my hair feels smooth and silky! Highly recommended for color-damaged hair.

review/summary: Was surprised
review/text: I received this item free for review.  I've got shoulder-length curly, frizzy hair.  Color is put on my roots every 3-4 weeks.  When I ordered this, I just hoped for the best regarding healthier hair.  The temps and humidity have been brutal this summer and I have seen some days since using this where my hair wasn't as frizzy.  Is that due to the shampoo and/or the conditioner?  Hard to determine.  Yesterday it was pretty frizzy again.<br /><br />Been using the product for about 2 weeks now.  Something I did notice a couple of days ago, was that there wasn't as much hair on the floor of the shower as I've been seeing for the past couple of years.  Wow, I wasn't expecting that.  It makes sense since this product is supposed to make your scalp healthier.  But slowing down hair loss is not listed as a selling point.<br /><br />The conditioner itself has a silky feel and a light pleasant scent and my hair feels good when getting out of the shower.  Both the shampoo and conditioner can be stood with the opening down, making it quicker to dispense.<br /><br />Two things I need to mention.  The first is that the item came well-wrapped in plastic, and it's a good thing it was.  There was some leakage with the shampoo during shipment.  Not a lot, but it would have messed up everything else in the box.  Probably better to purchase this from a brick and mortar store to avoid possible loss of product.<br /><br />The second is that in order to see a list of ingredients, you are told to pull up part of the label.  What???  Can you see doing this in a store?  Would you purchase one that already had part of the label pulled back?  I think a redesign is in order.<br /><br />On the whole I'm happy with using the product.<br /><br />Amending my review.  I've been using the product for over a month and I'm torn as to what I think of it.  I am definitely experiencing a lot less hair loss since using it, which is a HUGE plus.  However, my hair doesn't look and feel nearly as good and the color is being stripped out of it with each washing.  I think I'm going to have to stop using it.  I've downgraded the rating from a 4 to a 3.

review/summary: Mimics much more expensive conditioners
review/text: I love this conditioner.<br /><br />Pro's<br />* You don't need a lot to cover your hair (I have medium length very thick hair)<br />* You don't need to leave it on your hair longer than a minute or two.<br />* It comes out of the bottle onto your hand very thick, not thin and runny like most conditioners at this price point.<br />* It makes your hair extremely soft in a very short amount of time.<br />* Bottle rests upside down which I prefer, none wasted.<br />* Hair remains soft, even after drying.<br /><br />Con's<br />* I really cant think of any.  I tried this product because of Amazon Vine sent one for review, but I will continue to buy it as it is about 75cents to a dollar cheaper than my old conditioner and I think it works better.  It is suppossed to increase the health of your scalp, but I am not sure how I would notice that type of change.  I will also say that I am allergic to many shampoos and conditioners and I have had no problem with this after 4 uses.<br /><br />Great product, great price.

review/text: I used Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner for some time before I finally wrote this review. At first, I liked it very much. I am a conditioner junkie, and will give any new product a shot if it seems to fill the bill. However, my initial delight with this conditioner sent me running back to my other conditioners when I realized that the initial softness that I felt was being replaced by a dry, brittle feeling -- almost as though I had left soap in my hair. Not good at all! Furthermore, when I gently comb through my hair when it is dry, I am suddenly experiencing breakage, and this is NOT a problem I had before I used this conditioner.<br /><br />In essence, I do not recommend this product, and I am glad that I waited long enough to have gone almost through the entire bottle so that I could be sure about my results. FYI, I always thoroughly rinse my hair out in the shower, but the residue from Clear Scalp & Hair seems almost impossible to get out.

review/summary: Good Conditioner; the Packaging Needs Work
review/text: I have fairly thick, shoulder length colored hair that literally has a mind of its own.  A standing joke that's only part joke in my house is that the hair I wear all day is the hair that I woke up with.  It really is that thick.  So one of the things I look for in any conditioner is whether it can make my hair behave.  And I am pleased to report that this conditioner passed that test.<br /><br />I used it for three weeks and for that entire time my hair was amenable to the brush.  In other words, I got to have some (not complete but way more than normal) control of it.  I also noticed that I lost less hair than I do using regular shampoo and conditioner.  So the claim that the conditioner is good for the scalp is probably accurate.<br /><br />It feels good when I put it on--a kind of silky feel and when you wash it off, I can really feel how soft and pliable my hair is. The other nice thing is that it didn't seem to discolor my hair more than regular conditioners do.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like, quite frankly, was the packaging.  It leaked.  And, while this doesn't sound like a big deal we have two very curious little dogs at home and about the last thing I want them to eat is hair conditioner.<br /><br />Overall though, I would say that this is a good product that, given the benefits I experienced, is reasonably priced.

review/summary: something doesn't seem right
review/text: I didn't purchase this product through Amazon but at my local Target. I've tried the Total Care shampoo & conditioner, Strong Lengths shampoo & conditioner, AND Damage & Color Repair shampoo & conditioner. This review is inclusive off ALL of the products of theirs that I've tried.<br /><br />When I first bought the product (Total Care) I thought the smell was pleasant and the size of the product seemed in line for the price point they were selling it at. I purchased one shampoo and two conditioners (as I have really thick hair and generally go through conditioner faster than shampoo). After the first shampoo and condition when my hair dried I immediately thought that my hair felt softer than it had before ... which is saying a lot because I'm growing my hair out and the only non-color treated portion are my roots.<br /><br />I stuck with the Total Care line through 2 purchases and then decided to switch to the Strong Lengths line when I started noticing that my hair seemed to be breaking more often or just plain falling out more. Strong Lengths had the same good smell and left my hair feeling the same but didn't seem to be addressing my issue of hair breakage/falling out.<br /><br />Just two days ago I purchased the Damage & Color Repair line to try out. So far same scenario as before but I now believe I know why!!<br /><br />READ THE INGREDIANTS!! The ingrediants for ALL THREE shampoos & ALL THREE conditioners are EXACTLY THE SAME!!! How the heck does one work for damaged/colored hair specifically if both the Total Care & Strong Lengths have the same ingrediants. Just seems like a pure marketing scheme now.<br /><br />I'm not one to waste shampoo/conditioner so I'll finish out the bottles that I have purchased but I know when I'm done with them I WON'T BE BUYING THE PRODUCT AGAIN!<br /><br />Also, I read a review where the person mentioned that it seemed to take longer for their hair to get fully wet once they started using this product and I have to say that I agree with them.<br /><br />SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT WITH THIS PRODUCT!

We both can tell that this product is not good for our hair, especially considering its high alcohol content... Could be used as a decent de-tangler when used sparingly.<br /><br />Update:<br />Had to downgrade my reviews for this line when the skin on my arms and neck started breaking out after accumulated exposure-washing my daughter's hair in the sink in addition to using other products from same line on myself that day. Not the best choice for sensitive skin.<br /><br />*Found a "silver lining:"<br /><br />When scalp became extremely dry as a result, with dandruff "raining down" to the touch, I did an internet search. I found that VINEGAR is an excellent conditioner. I used 1/2 vinegar/water-amazing results! My scalp calmed down and my hair seems to have recovered-now soft to the touch instead of brittle.

review/summary: Great conditioner
review/text: I have long, fine very curly salon colored hair and a sometimes flaky scalp, so was eager to try this conditioner. Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy Damage & Color Repair Conditioner has a lovely but not overpowering scent, goes on smoothly, doesn't require a large amount to evenly coat my hair, and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky without being weighed down. It's definitely doing a good job of conditioning my hair. I've also noticed it has helped my flaky scalp. I wouldn't call my hair damaged but it does get dry and frizzy fairly easily. I've been using this conditioner with the Clear Complete Care shampoo, both of which I received free of charge from Amazon Vine, but will be purchasing my next bottle because I like it so much.

review/text: I really like this conditioner. I have thick, wavy hair that is fairly long, and lots of grey around my scalp that likes to curl. Most conditioners are too heavy to put on the scalp area, leaving me few options for the gray. However, when I use this, it tames those coarse gray hairs for at least two days. Not only that, but since I have been using both the shampoo and the conditioner, my hair has gotten more compliments! I have found that it is smoother, shinier, and just looks healthier. I was curious about this new brand after seeing a commercial, and I have to say - I really like it!

review/summary: Move over Nexxus, this is just as good, if not better
review/text: I am really picky about my shampoos/conditioners, and was SO dubious when Amazon sent me this item to review.<br />I have colored, fine hair, which frizzes easily and breaks often.  It grows very slowly and any harsh shampoos/conditioners will either break my hair or weigh it down and make it look dirty and lifeless.<br /><br />Amazon sent me this item (Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Damage and Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner) and the corresponding shampoo (Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Damage and Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo).<br /><br />I usually use the Nexxus damaged hair products that are found at Costco.  It is expensive, even at Costco.  But it didn't weigh my hair down nor cause breakage.<br /><br />This shampoo and conditioner smells GREAT.  I usually don't notice the scents, unless they are gross or medicinal, because my sense of smell is limited.  But this one smells really great, like fruity flowers.<br /><br />I use it basically like everyone--shampoo, rinse, condition, let sit for a minute and rinse.<br /><br />Here is where it's different:  When I comb out my hair, which is longer than shoulder length, it doesn't pull, tangle, or (on the other end of the spectrum) feel greasy or heavy.  It combs out sleekly (is that a word?) and as my hair dries naturally, it's not frizzy or lifeless--it shows off my natural curls.  If I dry it with the blowdryer, it doesn't frizz at all.  I can flat iron it, and maybe because it really allows the hair to curl naturally, it takes a bit more work to get that curl out, but it looks GREAT.<br /><br />I have been using it for a month now, and my hair dresser actually noticed a difference in my hair. She said that it grew more than usual (she's been doing my hair for 3 years now, every 6 weeks).  I believe that because my hair doesn't break or frizz, my hair really is "growing" faster because it's not breaking off.<br /><br />I didn't think that any line could replace my Nexxus, but this has.  It took me a long time to find the Nexxus--with my sensitive hair that breaks so easily...  And it saves me money, too, which is a great thing, especially in this economy.

review/summary: Leaves hair hard to style
review/text: Clear conditioner may feel good in the shower, but that is about all. Hair is easy to comb, but once dry impossible to style unless one adds a ton of other product. Claims that it is good for your scalp are unfounded - try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4GIPC">Nioxin Scalp Therapy, Conditioner System-1, Normal to Thin-Looking, 33.8 Ounce</a> if you truly want a conditioner for scalp. Scent is overpowering and next day hair is dry and lifeless. Not a good product for those with super straight styles.

review/summary: It's Supposed to Help, but ...
review/text: I love the scent of this product. That's the good news.<br /><br />But in my old age, I have developed a horrible itchy reaction to certain hair products, namely WEN, which gave me an awful rash on my hairline (front and back) as well as my entire neck. So when I saw this product, I thought it would be a relief now that my itchy WEN rash is finally (after SIX months of healing) a thing of the past.<br /><br />Sad to say that I was wrong. I used Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty conditioner and shampoo  three times in a row and guess what happened?  Yup. Same sort of irritation and itching in all of the same places.<br /><br />There must be a very specific ingredient the makers of hair products are including in their respective cleansers and conditioners because the fact that this has happened AGAIN literally has me scratching my head in disbelief.<br /><br />Again, this conditioner has a lovely scent - but I will not spend my waking and sleeping hours scratching myself like a cat with fleas.  If you have any sensitivity to hair products, avoid this one.<br /><br />Boo. So goes this product the way of WEN. In the trash.

review/summary: Quality Conditioner
review/text: I gave this to a woman in my life who is a lifelong salon shampoo and conditioner user and she said she really noticed a difference in the texture of her hair afterwords. The split ends were helped considerably. Being an older woman who has had her her colored many many times this was a conditioner that was surprisingly helpful despite its price. What was most noticeable to me was that her hair seemed to have more sheen than before using the product. Now I myself can't say I've used it, but for a woman that's had many hair treatments she has a pretty good estimation of how well these types of products work. I'd recommend a sample.

review/text: I have thick straight hair that was colored a few months before I tried this product. Over all, the packaging is nice, the scent pleasant, and I like the texture. However, I don't find this conditioner as moisturizing as my standards - Dove and Tresemme. My hair just feels coarser and drier after using this as compared to my regular products. It's OK and not bad, but I need something more moisturizing.

review/text: This conditioner does the job. It coats the hair well, smells pleasant, and seems to work fine. After using it rinses out well and my hair feels soft and manageable. I really can't find any superlative things to say about it, it does the job without any problems. I will say that I have an issue with telling which is the shampoo and which is the conditioner because the bottles are almost identical and I always forget which is which.<br /><br />I can't really tell if there is a benefit to using this on my colored hair or not. Everything seems fine with this conditioner, nothing stands out as being wonderful or awful. I did not have any leakage like other reviewers have reported with the shipping of this product. The cost is reasonable, that might be the best thing about this product.  I do like that the product is thick and not a runny consistency, it's easier to apply when I can get it to my head without having it drip off my hand.

review/text: I've tried a few of the "Clear" brand conditioners. Like the other ones I've tried, this one is lightly scented and I would have to say that I like the scent. I'm not sure exactly what the scent is but it is pleasant. The consistency of the conditioner is okay but I prefer thicker conditioners. It rinses out well enough and leaves my hair soft.<br />I like that the spout is on the bottom because this helps the conditioner settle and makes it easier to get the last bit of conditioner out of the bottle.

review/summary: Nice Conditioner, Rinses Well
review/text: I've been coloring my hair for too long to mention... There is a point that my hair starts to go from beautiful and shiny and newly colored to looking more rundown and dry.<br /><br />So after trying this conditioner for awhile, I would say it is a nice one, I'm not sure if it makes a difference with dyed hair but that's a tough one to measure. It smells okay, rinses well and has a really thick consistency.<br /><br />I also like the convenience of the container. It opens on the bottom and stands up solid. So it is always coming out from the bottom instead of having to be squeezed from the top.<br /><br />For the price, it's a nice conditioner and a good deal.

review/text: This bottle came and smelled so vile that I had to leave it on the porch! After a few days I could bring it inside.<br /><br />Not sure what caused that, as there was nothing unusual about the packaging. The conditioner's smell also is unappealing (though not as bad). As a conditioner, it worked fairly well,smoothly out tangles and leaving hair shiny. But it's hard to imagine anything gentle and "nourishing" would smell like this.

Clear Scalp was different from these.<br /><br />When I buy conditioner, I look out for two big things. Does it smell good and is it worth the money? The answer to both on these questions in the case of Clear Scalp is yes.<br /><br />This conditioner is only five dollars and comes in a pretty big container. It's a great value for your money. I plan on ordering more of this conditioner in the future.

This is a wonderfully luxurious conditioner that feels like silk when you use it and it does give my hair some fluff and omph.

I will gladly pay the small amount for this than the large $$ amount for the shampoo and conditioner I was buying at the salon.<br /><br />The product I feel is a nice quality product with an affordable price, nice fragrance without a yukky buildup on the hair and just an overall fantastic experience that will keep me using this for a long time to come.

review/text: I have shoulder length medium to thin hair. Weighing it down with heavy conditioners that cause it to look even thinner is unacceptable.  Additionally, within the last year I noticed that a couple of areas on my scalp were itchy. So, I was curious to see if this product would soothe the itch and condition without making my hair droop.<br /><br />Well, I am impressed. I've been using the conditioner for a few weeks and love the way my hair looks and the itchiness is greatly improved. I use about a quarter-sized dollop and focus on the ends of my hair with the majority but then run my palms over my scalp and wait a minute then rinse. The fragrance is mild and the price very reasonable. I will update my review if I encounter any problems.

review/summary: Good, smells great, decent price.
review/text: I'm a bit of a conditioner junkie :) I love to try lots of scents and 'promises' with different conditioners, so I will rate this on the following that I go by for myself:<br /><br />Price: Five stars<br /><br />Scent: Five stars, I love it. I even let my hair dry naturally a few times so that I could enjoy the scent longer!<br /><br />Conditioning during shower: This did great for making my hair easy to comb through before I dried it.<br /><br />Conditioning overall: Not so much. Even though I love to try new conditioners, I always end up rating them against my favorite (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9RRD8">Tresemme Vitamin E Moisture Rich Conditioner, 32 Ounce</a>) and it doesn't come close. Before I dried my hair, things looked good. My hair smelled great, felt great. But after I dried it, it already felt rough. Hours later it was hard to believe I had conditioned my (colored) hair at all. With the Tresemme my hair is baby soft, and I mean that literally, I can't stop touching it. I guess the rule here is why change when something works? Because I'm a conditioner junkie, I told you!! :)<br /><br />Ultimately, if you can't find the Tresemme, this conditioner is okay.

review/text: So far I really like this conditioner. It has a nice, light, creamy feel to it and quickly absorbs into the hair. For anyone with dry or damaged hair, whether it's from coloring, sun, pool or just naturally dry hair, this is the perfect conditioner. After using it, my hair felt softer, less frizzy and more smooth when I blow dried it. If you are someone who has fine or thin hair, you might want to apply it toward the middle and ends and avoid the roots because the oils in the conditioner might be a little too heavy for certain types of hair and weigh it down.

review/summary: For Best Results Use Clear Shampoo As Well
review/text: I started with just the shampoo first and instantly regretted it. The shampoo requires the conditioner for good results.  The conditioner is very thick and feels oily but doesn't leave your hair oily. It definitely makes it very sleek, soft and silky to the touch. It also takes the frizz out of your hair (if you have trouble with that like I do) but doesn't make it limp like some shampoo/conditioner's do. The smell of both the shampoo and conditioner is light and pleasing. It's not fruity or floral. I'd describe it as a very light perfumed scent.<br /> I don't know that I will switch to this shampoo and conditioner exclusively when I run out, but the price and free shipping (with Amazon Prime) certainly makes it appealing. I awarded it three stars because it requires both the shampoo and conditioner to get great results. I like more freedom in selecting my hair care products.

I also like that I didn't have to use a whole bunch to get full coverage (I only had to use about a quarter sized amount). It smells pretty good (I would say about as good as Pantene or Garnier Fructis, but better than any of the Head and Shoulders scents I've tried) and after blow drying left my hair soft and silky, but not greasy-even the next day.  I did use it with the Clear shampoo, so I think that using both products together also helped and would recommend that you get the shampoo as well!<br /><br />Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn't get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box.

Well I'm sorry there just aren't any, but this conditioner comes slightly closer than most.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this conditioner is the smell ---I don't know who think that the aroma of musk (at least this is what I  think this is) is going to be a good one for hair.  I hate wearing anything with a smell other than my perfume.  I usually use fragrance free everything. The aroma of this product clung to my hair for the whole day.<br /><br />I did  seem to see less hair in my  comb as I was combing my hair out after my shower and my comb ran through my hair quite easily.<br />But even after thorough rinsing my hair felt greasier than it did silky. When dry my hair did not have the usual manageability that I normally do with my OTC 'Nexus' products.

review/text: When Vine offered this conditioner, I was looking to replace my brand. I have fine, fragile, medium-length hair, which I dye with permanent dye every two months. I never use a blow dryer, which would dry out my hair too much, but I still have problems with breakage.<br /><br />After trying it, I find that this conditioner is what I need. It leaves my hair soft, smooth, and tangle free--I almost don't have to comb it after washing. It's neither too thick, too thin, too greasy, nor too watery. It's easy to apply; I just rub on a little bit and rinse it off after about two minutes. The fruity scent is rather strong, but pleasant, and it does fade a little soon after application.<br /><br />I don't know why some reviewers say this conditioner has a "salon price." In the city where I live, this conditioner has a drugstore price.

Nothing strips it like dandruff shampoos! But this not only in two uses, relieved my itchy dry scalp, it left my hair nice...and has been much gentler on my OTC hair color. I like the scent.

review/summary: I think these products work very well.
review/text: I had seen the commercial for the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy.  I was intrigued by the idea of a shampoo and conditioner working from the scalp and its claim to restore the scalp's natural moisture balance.  I had never seen a product focused on the nourishing of the scalp which makes more sense than all the shampoos and conditioners of the past that are supposed to work on the ends of your hair.  The past products focused more on the prevention of split ends or ending fizzy hair.  I color my hair every 6 to 8 weeks, so I always purchase a color-safe shampoo and conditioner.  I also liked that has vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C & E, sunflower, almond, soybean, coconut oils and aloe vera.<br /><br />The bottles arrived wrapped in plastic bubble wrap and did have a small amount of leakage on the shampoo bottle but the conditioner bottle was okay.  I have used both the shampoo and conditioner for over a week and I like the products very much.  The shampoo has a lovely lavender color and a light scent.  I didn't find the scent overpowering.  I like that it takes a dime size amount to get a good lather.  The conditioner also works well with a small amount in your palm.  Most conditioners I use require quite a bit to work through my entire head of hair.  I think the conditioner is very easy to work through my hair without a lot of pulling and snagging.  It feels good and it doesn't leave a heavy, greasy film on my hair.  It rinses very clean.  Overall, I like the products.  Often in the past, most store bought shampoos begin to break my head and scalp out and neither of these products have done that.  I like that both shampoo and conditioner are designed to be set in such a way that the conditioner and shampoo bottles can be set flat so that the product is always draining down towards the opening.  I would recommend both of these products.

review/summary: Great scent, scalp isn't itchy, hair feels silky
review/text: I wanted to try this shampoo since I saw the ads in the magazines.  Since I have colored hair, I was afraid of using a product that would dry out my hair further.  The shampoo smells great, doesn't have too much lather and doesn't feel like I have to wash twice.  The conditioner is a nice creamy texture with the same familiar fragrance, a little like Finesse.  Scalp feels great, not itchy at all.  Very happy with Clear.

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: i recently tried and reviewed another conditioner by Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty that I loved. I thought I would try this one because I color my hair red which can fade fast. This was not very nourishing at all. It left my hair frizzy when I air dried it and that doesn't usually happen. This is more for someone who needs a very light conditioner, not hair that gets damaged or repaired.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised
review/text: I was prepared to not like this product very much. I expected a drugstore quality product that retails for a salon quality price. I was wrong. The conditioner rinses clean and leaves my color-treated hair feeling noticeably softer than before. I also *really* like the bottle. Somehow, with the cap on the bottom, there seems to be less waste. Now for the cons -- I don't believe the claims that it can really strengthen hair. If you look at the ingredients statement, the nutrients they promote are in minimal supply. That said, I'll continue to use it, even if it doesn't live up to the promises on the label because I like the scent and the soft way my hair feels.

review/text: This conditioner makes my hair silky soft, and it smells great!  This is the only conditioner whose instructions say to work it into your scalp, so I do and it's very easy to rinse out.  I will definitely continue to use this.  :)

review/summary: It's good to use with the shampoo
review/text: I dye my hair and live in a dry climate, but my hair gets very brittle.  This conditioner, along with the shampoo, makes my hair stronger and easier to manage. I do also use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Z8LLI">Sensories Smoother Passionflower and Aloe Leave In Texturizing Condition By Rusk, 33.8 Ounce</a> after I towel dry my hair after washing so maybe all three make my hair easy to comb and style without a lot of split ends.

review/summary: Soft, silky
review/text: I have color treated hair that has gone coarse and a bit brittle from coloring. After a few weeks of use, my hair feels soft and silky after washing. I was concerned over how it would affect the color over time, but so far, it seems to have no negative side effects.

review/summary: Protects and coats the hair and I love the scent and the shine
review/text: This conditioner is a great complement to the shampoo of the same brand.  The conditioner not only helps restore moisture to your scalp but it also helps protect your color and prevent future damage. It is color-safe and it coats the hair completely and sinks into your strands helping them feel softer and it made my hair shiny too. Some of the ingredients include Nutrium 10 which is touted as "an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients" and they include vitamins B5, C & E, sunflower, almond, soybean & coconut oils & aloe vera. The scent lingers even after your hair is dry and isn't overpowering when applying. It rinses cleanly but your hair still feels coated like it soaked the protective elements into the shaft.

review/text: I color my hair and naturally it gets damaged.  This is a wonderful product.  It makes your hair so silky and the scent is great.  I use the shampoo too and I would highly recommend it.  This is a very thick creamy texture so if you really need help with your hair being dry or damaged this is the one to get.  I love it.

review/summary: Great conditioner.
review/text: I have used ths conditioner for a little while. This bottle was the first i recieved from amazon but not the first i used. I'm very happy with it. It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, goes on and through the air smoothly with none of the unpleasant thick clingy consistency i have experienced with some other products. It also rinses out easily and completely which is very important for a conditioner. My hair when dry doesn't look weighed down at all. It was shipped tightly wrapped in plastic and while there was a little leakage into the wrap it was completely contained and easily rinsed off from the bottle so it didn't concern me.

review/summary: Moisturing but not color protecting.
review/text: My husband and I tried this product along with the corresponding shampoo. His hair is dry, thinning, and brittle, very curly but not color treated. Mine is normal, slightly wavy, with good body, and salon colored.<br /><br />He likes this product for the moisturizing effect. We have tried just about every product we can find but his hair continues to be fragile.  This is the first product that he said actually makes a difference. His hair is softer and breaks less after only 2 weeks.<br /><br />For my color treated hair, it's made no positive difference. I don't like the texture feel of the hair when wet, and my color has faded twice as fast as it does using John Frieda conditioner for red hair.<br /><br />We'll probably keep buying this product for my husband's brittle hair, but I've stopped using it on mine.

review/summary: Super silky hair
review/text: I needed a lightweight conditioner to help my color treated hair because it is oily and a bit damaged and this fit the bill.  It really smells nice without having an overly perfumed smell.  But best of all it left my hair feeling silky and easy to comb.  Once dried, my hair was not weighted down and felt so soft.  I will be using this conditioner in the future and am giving up my way expensive Lanza product because I like this better.  I knocked off a star because I thought the design of the bottle was a bit odd.

review/summary: Clear Scalp, Clear Head
review/text: I ordered both the Clear Scalp Shampoo and the Conditioner for Damage and Color Repair since I regularly color my dark hair and like to use products that help sustain the color. I typically buy sulfate-free since those seem to work best, and was a little bit surprised that this formula contained sulfates. However, I didn't notice any negative difference in my color after using it for a just few weeks.<br /><br />The shampoo did seem to be a thorough cleanser,leaving my hair "squeaky clean" and once I added the conditioner it left my hair soft and silky as I stepped out of the shower. I found the scent clean and pleasant and it doesn't linger at all after rinsing.<br /><br />Once blow-dried, it did seem that the shampoo might have been a bit of a stronger cleanser than I am used to since my hair was slightly fluffier than usual. It could also be that the conditioner was not as deep conditioning as I have found with other products made for color-treated or damaged hair. I should note that I have relatively "normal-dry" wavy hair and this might be a bit more ideal for those who have "oily-normal" hair.<br /><br />I would recommend this combo to anyone looking for a super clean head of hair with body, but not to anyone who tends to have very dry hair to begin with since it may be a bit too harsh. I also wonder about long term use on color treated hair with a product that contains sulfates, since I prefer those without. They performed pretty well, so I did give the shampoo/conditioner 4 stars, but it could have had 5 if it were sulfate-free.

review/summary: ***Conditions*** Well! Good Price, Too!
review/text: So far I've used the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY DAMAGE & COLOR REPAIR CONDITIONER for about a month. I've got coarse, dry, and thick hair, which tends to poof up in high humidity. I also dye my hair, so I was looking for something that would not only condition my hair, but preserve the color in between tint jobs.<br /><br />I colored my hair about 2 weeks before starting the CLEAR SCALP CONDITIONER, and now, about a month and half out, the color still looks fresh and my hair is nicely conditioned (however I do add a leave-in conditioner afterward because if I don't my hair looks like a helmet, but my hair felt nice and soft and detangled right out of the shower before applying my leave-in).<br /><br />It softened the first time I used it and has a fresh -- but light -- scent that smells like a combination of citrus, strawberries, and some flowers. There was a brand called "Liante" in the orange bottle that I found in a Korean Supermarket and this smells like that.<br /><br />Another thing I should mention is that I've been breaking out on my scalp, not from this product, but I suspect it might be one of my styling products and so far this conditioner hasn't made the problem worse and I haven't had any issues. I was using a shampoo and conditioner with Neem Oil in it, which I read helped with scalp issues until I used this one.<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY does have a formula that supposed to help with dandruff and other scalp maladies but it contains, like most, Pyrithione Zinc, which hasn't really helped me.<br /><br />Anyway, I think it works better than similarly priced conditioners so give it a try.
