review/summary: Great pretzels!
review/text: I found these pretzels originally when I started eating a primarily gluten-free diet.  They taste great!  I had been getting them from my grocery store, but they are rather expensive, so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for a less expensive price and I was able to get them for even less when I got them on auto-ship.  These pretzels are my main snack food and even my family loves them.  I would highly recommend them.

review/summary: Great Taste!!!
review/text: These are better than "regular" pretzels. They are light and crunchy with a buttery taste. I am so glad to have found these. They restored hope that I can have good food without the "aftermath" that typically comes with eating.<br /><br />My mother, who has no problem with gluten, tried them and liked them. She even packed up some to take with her after tasting them. She was surprised, because she thought they were going to be salty - like "normal" pretzels.

review/summary: THE Best Pretzels = they are better than those with gluten
review/text: MY husband cannot became alergic to gluten about a year ago and thus we have been trying all kinds of products.  These are expensive so I buy my kids pretzel's at the grocery store.  I can say these taste 10X better than any that I have had (regular / with gluten) - they have a fabulous taste.  I would recommend these if you like Pretzels - even if you can eat gluten they just taste great

review/summary: Best pretzels
review/text: These are hands down the best pretzels I've ever had. Since having to be gluten free, I've tried other brands, but truly prefer these. My non GF family prefer Glutino Pretzels to regular(poison) pretzels. My daughters friends always ask her to bring some to school. I have yet to find someone that can tell these are GF. Buying the case not only saves money, but I always have some on hand!

review/text: My girlfriend can't have any gluten, basically anything at all with wheat. Most of the gluten free products that would normally be made with wheat flour either taste weird or have a odd texture to them when you are chewing.<br />She came home with these the other day and they actually taste really good! Although most gluten free items seem a bit pricey I may buy a case of these for her, and help eat a few of them...

review/summary: Love these
review/text: These are my favorite of the gluten free pretezels but they are expensive. So I decided to order a case from Amazon. I was VERY disappointed when the package arrived. They sent the regular pretzels and further the order said no returns. I called and they did refund my money but did not offer to send me the right product. I would rather have had the sesame pretzel rings I ordered. I won't order anything else bulk from here. I have had such good luck ordering from Amazon I was really disappointed with this order and Amazon :(  I gave a one star on the review because I did not get the product I ordered. The pretzels are a 5 star in my book.

review/summary: I love these pretzels!!!
review/text: I recently discovered these at a local Walmart priced at about $5 or $6 a bag (about 4 servings).  I decided to check on Amazon and loved the lower price.  A case of 12 bags for about $31.  I have not been diagnosed with Celiac disease (so far), but I am very sensitive to gluten and to oats (migraines, intestinal pains, diarrhea).  These pretzels have never once caused a reaction of any kind , even if I pig out on an entire bag in one weekend.  The only negative thing I could say is that the fat count in higher than I'd like. 8 grams for 32 pretzels.  Salt content is moderately high at 540mg, but they are pretzels after all.  I highly, highly recommend these pretzels.

review/text: Christmas isn't complete without Party Mix. My mom started the tradition with a 1960's recipe from my great-aunt. Now I use that same recipe for my grown-up kids and their families using all gluten free ingredients. Glutino pretzel sticks are the best; they're light, with just enough salt, and none of that bitter after-taste that many gf pretzels have. They are my first choice.

I put these out at parties and playdates and have been asked what brand they were as our guest noticed how tasty and fast they were going. Light, flavorful, and a satisfying crispy crunch. Awesome!

Foods can be limited since most schools won't allow you to pack peanut products in lunchboxes due to peanut allergies in other children.

review/summary: Where have all the pretzels gone?
review/text: I recently purchased the 20-pack of 2.6 oz. bags of Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists. They are excellent and my family agrees! The 2.6 oz. bag makes it easy to control portions for those who (like me) are on a restricted diet. Unfortunately, when I tried to re-order within the last week, they are not available or no longer stocked. Upon searching for other suppliers, I found a few who have these available. However, they are available at a higher price than on Amazon. I already consider these great tasting pretzels to be a splurge item - if you do the math you find they are a little pricey for a snack item, even at Amazon's price. I truly hope these Glutino gluten-free pretzels will soon become available. I had planned to buy them again and again. They are a good-tasting, crisp and crunchy, very satisfying snack food.

review/text: This sea salt sampler is a great way to try different salts and determine which one(s) you want to buy more of. If you have never tried sea salts this, again, is a great way to start.  You'll be amazed how elements from the different regions of the world affect the subtle flavors of the salt.  Then when you cook, you'll notice those subtle flavors enhancing whatever you use them in. It is great for the at-home gourmet.<br /><br />Also, they include a wooden spoon so that you don't use your fingers to get the salt.  This prevents skin oils, etc. from affecting the salt's subtle flavors.  It's great!

review/summary: Thank goodness for this cat food!
review/text: The food this company makes is the closest I can find to raw until I actually get to feed mine raw more often. The value is amazing... actually because it is so dense with nutrients, my cats eat less and I spend less feeding them this brand of food than the other premium brands I was feeding them before.<br /><br />The canned is a dense pate style that needs to be mashed down. My cats had not been fond of pate textures of other brands of foods in the past. It took about 4 days for one of my cats to recognize it as her new food. She had to be enticed but it ends up she is loving it! (Patience pays off!) The other cat will eat anything and there was no problem getting her to eat it. The both now eat all 3 available flavors and seem to love the rabbit the best. The Canned Duck and Salmon is their second favorite. It seems to be more "decadent" than the other flavors (rich in oils) and has been amazing for their skin. So little dander and shedding...<br /><br />Their coats are magnificent! Their stools are small and odorless, similar to what it would look like if they were on a raw diet. My oldest cat who had mild digestive issues doesn't have them anymore. Hooray! I also noticed that while on this brand of food, the crusty sleepies in their eyes are just about non-existent. I hardly have to groom their faces anymore. And they are so active I can hardly believe they have that much energy for their ages.<br /><br />I honestly believe that having no synthesized vitamins makes a world of difference. I had to go back to my old brand of kibble for a short time because I was waiting for my next Nature's Logic order to arrive. On their old brand the cats were producing so much extra waste and it wasn't nearly as healthy-looking. The difference really is amazing.<br /><br />There is no doubt to me the Nature's Logic foods are truly easy to digest and the nutrients are absorbed and used! I hope they continue to grow and the product becomes more well known and available. I recommend it to everyone with cats!<br /><br />Pros : Improves Coat, Increased Activity, Good Value, Likes It, All Natural, Good Taste, Nutritional, Easy To Digest, Odorless Stools<br />Cons : Few Flavor Selections

review/summary: Slap ya Mama
review/text: I was given a container (shaker) of Slap Ya Mama and enjoyed it very much.  Not having found it in local stores, I ordered a six-pack from Amazon at a good price.  Although this is a blend of salt & peppers, it is heavy on the salt.  I find it is so salty that you have to use it very sparingly.  Nevertheless, it has a good taste and is a good all around seasoning for everything from boiled eggs to soups.  Use it as you would more ordinary seasoned salt.

review/summary: FLAVOR!
review/text: Once in a while Amazon recommendations really hit one out of the park. I took a chance and ordered this based on a recommendation and the reviews and I'm glad I did. We use this on almost everything we cook. It spices up chicken, red meats and even fish fantastically. It you like some spice in your food, it's addictive.

review/summary: Essential spice
review/text: This is an essential spice that we use on many foods. It's not very spicy so it won't overpower the flavor of foods. It's great on seafood (on salmon it's amazing), eggs, and we even put it on popcorn. You get a 6-pack from Amazon which will probably last you well over a year.

review/summary: Really good, but a little heavy on the salt
review/text: I was involved in a food challenge using this product.  It was not, however, a challenge set up by Slap Ya Mama, but rather a person in  a foodie group that fell in love with the seasoning.  We were provided free seasoning mixes of both regular and hot.<br /><br />Being involved in said challenge meant using SYM in as many ways as we could.  And let me tell you, there are lots of ways.  This stuff is pretty great and very versatile.  It works on meat, fish, stews, vegetables, sauces.  It is killer with sweet potatoes.  Chicken wings, dipped in butter then sprinkled with SYM and baked will rock your world.<br /><br />Personally, I like a mix of half regular, half hot.  This largely due to the saltiness of the regular blend, which is *really* salty.<br /><br />I guess a good indicator of my enjoyment of the product is that even after being given freebie mixes, I actually came in here and bought a six-pack when I ran out.

review/summary: SLAP IT ON!!!
review/text: I love this stuff - it's just a simple blend of salt, black and red pepper, and garlic. I put it on my eggs, shrimp, chicken, pork, beans, pasta, mac-n-cheese, in chili, stews, soups, SLAP! I love just saying "Slap Ya Mama!" as I suddenly decide to add a dash to whatever I'm cooking when the urge overtakes me. You will have to experiment for yourself how much or little to add to your foods because sometimes I go too far and it's a little too salty or hot, but that's my fault - gotta develop a practiced hand to go with that judicious mind! Just slap it!

review/summary: Very good product
review/text: I use to buy Spirulina in Mexico where it is a lot more consumed than in the US and way cheaper.... After checking various spirulina powder qualities, I decided to buy this organic one from Earth Circle and I was not disappointed. It's a truly good product, well packed to protect its freshness even though I would have prefered a jar easier to open. And it's easier to take a spoon of this very thin powder from a jar because any wrong move with the spoon when you take it from a bag makes a mess on your kichen counter !

review/summary: My poodle loves them!
review/text: For some reason my miniature/toy poodle loves fishy foods (especially sneaking into the cats food), so I was excited to find these fish recipe sticks. Made in USA is a huge must for my dogs treats after the Chinese treat issues, and I was happy to find this company offers that. My poodle is about 8lbs and this lasted her about 1/2-1 hour of chewing. More known brands (those you would find in every grocery store) usually get abandoned by my dog after a couple minutes when she realizes she doesn't care for the taste.<br /><br />An issue I've had with other products and my dogs are upset tummys if they eat too much. These sticks have caused no issues at all!<br /><br />I greatly recommend this product for those who care about quality.

review/text: My just turned 4 year old daughter will NOT, I repeat NOT, eat fruit of any kind.  The last time she ate fruit was baby food.  No joke.  She has food aversions, texture issues, temperature issues, pickiness issues, and has been in feeding therapy for 1.5 years.  She won't drink water unless it's purified (she can tell the difference). I mean this is serious stuff.<br /><br />I bought one of these and gave it to her, explained that it was baby food consistency but wasn't baby food, and was fruit (didn't lie to her) but wasn't a cold smoothie like the kind Mommy makes (which she does NOT like).<br /><br />She slurped the whole thing down!  Tears came to my eyes I was so shocked and excited.  This whole feeding drama is very trying on my patience and I worry so often that she will have long-term problems.<br /><br />She has been devouring them ever since!  This as well as The Red One.  I cannot believe that she is "eating" fruit!!!  I am forever a loyal buyer of Ella's Kitchen products.  When my son is ready for solids, I will feed him Ella's baby food.  I cannot tell you how thankful and happy I am to finally get fruit in my daughter's belly!

review/text: My kids love these!!  We have tried the red one, yellow one, and purple one and they love all 3.  My 11 month old is allergic to milk and soy, so trying to find him portable snacks has been a challenge, but he adores these.  And he has learned how to suck them down by himself, which is a big plus for me. My 4 1/2 year old loves them too, the challenge with her is keeping her from eating them all at once!  Amazon has a better price than our store, too, plus the only 2 stores that sell these in my area are 30 mins away.  Love Amazon for saving me the gas and delivering to my house!

These aren't available in all stores yet, so subscribing keeps them on-hand at all times.

review/summary: Delicious, Healthy, Easy for Kids to Open Snack!
review/text: My kids have tried all of the Ella's Kitchen "smoothies" and love them.  (By the way, they make baby food ones, too.)  This is a real blessing for any busy mom who has her hands full.  Or any on-the-go mom.  We brought these on a 4-day roadtrip and they were a lifesaver!  Everytime our kiddos got hungry, we'd hand them back one of these.  They could open and close them themselves, it was a very healthy snack, and it was not at all messy.  Ella's Kitchen pouches are notably easier than most squeezable fruits we've tried and we've pretty much tried them all--the tops are nice and big and easy for even toddlers to unscrew and screw back on. This one is a mix of currants, blueberries, bananas, and apples.  The other flavors are The Green One, The Yellow One, and the Red One. So yummy!

When my youngest got hungry, I could just lean back and hand him one of these.  He was 3, could unscrew the lid himself, and it was a healthy, non-messy snack.  I highly recommend!

review/text: I love Ella's because there are so many great mixes of fruits and vegetables for my baby to try.  The best way to prevent a picky eater in the toddler years is to give a wide variety of flavors and textures when they're still babies.  I love all the pouches, because I don't want to get jars with BPA in the lining of the lid and I also don't have time to make baby food either.  Ella's says they hope to introduce recyclable packaging in the next year or two, but that right now, this is the best way to protect the foods that are made without preservatives.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a different flavor profile to introduce to their little one.  '

review/summary: Ella's Kitchen Organic - THE RED ONE
review/text: I have a 17 month old who absolutely loves these.  She has tried the Yellow One, the Red One and the Green One.  She likes them all.  We have tried other brands of convenient pounches and they are NOT the same, she will throw the other pouches on the floor.  When she sees Ella's at the store, she wants them right then.  As soon as I open it, she eats it up and asks for more.  She is small for her age, so I encourage her to eat these as much as she wants.  So glad I found these on Amazon, the price is so much better.  In the stores they average $1.50 - $1.79 each.

The lid is perfect for tiny hands to open and you can reseal the package if it's not all consumed. All organic ingredients, nothing artificial.

review/summary: Good, but other options  may be healthier
review/text: "The Red One", organic baby food "smoothie"<br /><br />If you're like me, you're interested in this item because it looks convenient and like something your baby will actually eat -- that would be a pretty good description of this product, with a few caveats:<br /><br />-The nutrition content of this product is not really that great.  We tend to mix this in with rice cereal for some iron, but otherwise it's a bit of a waste on its own.<br />-The taste is good, but maybe a little sweet for baby.<br />-The packaging is great -- very portable, screw top cap.  You tend not to waste much product with the packaging design.<br /><br />Just a reminder, the container is a bit smaller than some of the other "bagged" baby foods:  3 oz is less than the plastic Gerber containers (at 3.5 oz), but more than the small glass jar foods (usually 2.5 oz).

review/text: Picked one of these up this morning at our local natural foods market.  I gave it to my 22 month old daughter when we got into Kroger and she devoured it and asked for more, didn't have another so she sucked on the packaging the rest of the time in the store.  Will definitely buy more of these to have on hand for snacking on the road this summer, otherwise I will just buy the organic fruit and make it myself at home.  I tasted it too and it was delicious!  No GMO's and no pesticides, that sealed the deal for me.

review/summary: tasty, healthy snack
review/text: I prefer to stick with organic versions of the "dirty dozen" in produce (which, sadly, includes most berries), but I also try to follow my pediatrician's advice to have my son "eat the rainbow" each day. That gets tough, especially when we get into fall/winter, when fresh fruits and veggies are fewer and far between. Organic berries (like the strawberries and raspberries in this product) are expensive, hard to find, and definitely out of season right now here in NY. Enter Ella's Red One Smoothie Fruits. These pouches are great to have around as an option to round out my toddler's colorful fruit intake for the day. Not to mention, they're delicious - think applesauce, with sweet berries added for extra flavor and flair! And they're ideal when we're on the go. With a few of these tossed into my diaper bag, I always have something healthy and organic on hand for him to enjoy. They're even a nice snack for me when I find myself a bit low on energy when we're out and about. The crushed fruit inside these pouches is smooth (almost baby food consistency), so it slurps up through the straw-like top easily. Once I've unscrewed the cap, my 17 month old can eat this entirely without my help, leaving my hands free to get stuff done. Sweet!

review/summary: My current favorite food product
review/text: My little one eats very few purees nowadays.  He likes feeding himself.  However, these smoothies are good for both Baby and Momma.  a) The flavor is FANTASTIC with organic goodness bursting at the seams of your taste buds.  b)  I love, love, LOVE this pouch.  During a feeding, I normally start by squeezing a biteful at a time into a spoon for my little one.  No mess and resealable if he decides he only wants 1/3 of the container.  I've also found that after a while, my little one likes to hold the pouch and slowly squirt it into his mouth.  Once again, no mess for me to clean up, and Little Guy is very pleased at the food and being able to feed himself.<br />Fabulous product indeed.

In addition, all this is is pureed fruit - no added sugars, no preservatives, nothing. It's a snack I am happy to give to my kids. We take them everywhere - in the car, to the beach, to the zoo, sometimes I pack them in my son's lunch for school, etc. And they're a great snack for the parents as well... We will continue to purchase these for years I am sure.

review/summary: Delicious, Tasty and Healthy for my Little One!
review/text: My 20 month old loves fruits and vegetables! When I say he loves them, I mean he would pick them over his other snacks. So I don't complain when he asks for them either. We have a cupboard filled with these healthy snack pouches just on hand when we run out of his veggies and fruits. We take them along wherever we go. These come in very handy!<br /><br />We used another brand before this one (Plum Organics) but although tasty, they were more runny in consistency. I find that Ella's taste more natural as if they were truly mashed with a fork. Another reviewer thought that Ella's was more sugary but I don't agree. I think its because Ella's is more firmer than the Plum Organics, which tastes a little water down.<br /><br />My son loves these and doesn't even mind having some of the Stage 1 for babies! I gave this product 5 stars because it tastes good, its packaged nice, they come in different combinations and it healthy!

I have problems keeping food down and went on a baby food diet for the sake of thriving. This stays down but is beginning to cause some indigestion at times. I'm not saying it would cause you guys to reflux or anything of that sort, but it was really acidic and caused me to choke. My throat now burns a lot, and feels sore, Please be weary if you're having gastrointestinal problems. Babyfood is such a great idea if you're having problems keeping things in, and need to retrain your stomach and intestines. Just be careful, some are more acidic than others.<br /><br />P.S. I like this flavor better than "The Red One".

review/summary: Red Matcha tea made from Rooibos
review/text: I think there is a wrong description of this tea listed at the moment, this tea is made from the rooibos plant.<br /><br />I bought the tea since I do love the Japanese green matcha tea, but that is so energizing I don't want do drink it at night. Plus I wanted to try something new.<br /><br />I found that there are only about 3 companies who do sell red matcha. I tried this one from Red Leaf Tea since I saw that they had many different types of matcha available, even black and white matcha. So they appear to be matcha specialists! I sometimes cannot wait for my shipment of green tea to arrive from Japan, it takes so long. I was happy to find Red Tea and they are an American company, the shipping was fast!<br /><br />I love the red matcha, it has its own sweet flavor, I liked it without sugar or cream. It is very thirst quenching. I haven't tried it iced, but I read that it is wonderful as an iced tea or iced latte. I only bought the small size so I am conserving. I am using the rest to make just plain, I just add hot water and whisk or stir. It is absolutely delicious without anything added. It foams up pretty nicely also! I should have bought the bigger size from Red Tea. I was trying it for the first time.  Now I have another tea I like as much as green tea matcha!<br /><br />This red matcha is very healthy and FULL of anti-oxidants, even more so than green tea! It is a good tea to drink at bedtime since it is relaxing, but it also makes a good daytime tea.  I think this tea will be revitalizing if you need and relaxing if you want, it is unique.<br /><br />Try this: add some red tea matcha to warm milk or soymilk (any kind of milk) with your favorite sweetener. YUMM!<br /><br />I put some of the matcha in lowfat 1% milk with some vanilla agave syrup (I didn't have plain agave) and then used my espresso machine's steamer to foam the milk and create a delicious dessert.  I was a little embarrassed to try to get every little bit of foam out of my mug, so I made a second serving!  I still got every bit out of the mug at the end, that is how good it is!
