review/summary: Walkerswood Jamaican Jerk Seasoning
review/text: Ran into this stuff first at a Hops Grill and Bar, grilled salmon. Liked it so much I bought a little tub of it from the place. I've moved, and Hops is not around here. No worries. I can do my own thing with a jar of this, some clarified butter, sour cream and yoghurt.<br /><br />A little goes a long ways. But I don't know of anything that compares, let alone beats the taste.

review/summary: absolute best
review/text: i've used this seasoning for at least 15 years. turned everyone i know who cooks on to it...folks who cook, can't settle for subs... tried other look alikes, that are cheaper...always disappointed w subs.  walkerswood is just the best most flavorful.  it's highly concentrated seasoning, so you don't need to use a lot...mixing w a bit of olive oil is a great idea to help spread product... it is high in sodium, so be mindful. that said, use it to add spice and flavor to everything from deviled eggs to baked chicken..to red beans and rice...mix it w duck sauce, spread on any meat you like...bake and enjoy... make a dip for shell fish...for quick zest...it makes everything you add it to, seem like a specially fussed over dish.  a little goes a long way. once you use this, the others just won't do...worth every penny...enjoy

review/summary: Authentic Jamaica - "No Problem" with a 6-pack of Red Stripe beer
review/text: On our first trip to Jamaica in 1985, our whole family fell in love with Jerk Chicken and Jerk Pork from the street-side shops throughout Jamaica.  We brought back 5 brands of this stuff in our suitcases from grocery stores on that trip.  I think Walkers Wood was one of the brands.  In any case Walkers Wood is great and is now on the menu in the households of my 4 adult children. We use it at least once a week on our gas or charcoal grill year around.<br /><br />My Chicken 'Recipe'<br />Use a whole cutup chicken or equivelent package of chicken wings or chicken drummies . . . or for best value get a 10 pound bag of frozen chicken wings from Costco. $2.00/pound compard to $3.25 at grocery store.  Coat with about 2 heaping tablespoons of this sauce. If you have the time, let it marinade for a while.  Put on indirect heat on the grill for 1 hour+ for a whole cut-up chicken or 50 minutes for wings.  Turn over once during cooking.  Adjust the time for the temperature.  The built-in thermometer on my Weber gas grill runs at about 375-400 degrees when it is turned to about 20%.<br /><br />Dark Golden Brown . . . The Jerk Sauce darkens more than just plain chicken.  Indirect grill until deep golden brown.<br /><br />Slow grilling can chemically burn off the 'heat' in peppers. Depending on the audience, we sometimes add a little Tobasco Sauce to the Jerk Sauce to reinforce the pepper.  Some of the best Jerk Chicken & Pork vendors in Kingston serve jerk that is HOT! . . but nothing a couple of Red Stripe beers or coka-colas for kids can't fix.<br /><br />Other Vendors in Negril and Ocho Rios tame the heat but still have the spicy and lime flavors.<br /><br />If you want to complete the Jamaica experience serve with Fried Rice and Peas.  Prepare some white rice, add some chicken bouillon and 1 finely diced Serrano pepper, then finish in a fying pan with a little oil and green peas.

review/text: The last jar I bought seemed under-salted. Wonder if they heard Americans are afraid of salt these days and changed the recipe. I doctored it my usual way, but with salt added to the usual lime juice and olive oil. I use it on chicken thighs or pork chops. Shallow slashes on the surface of the meat to increase surface area, 24-hour marination in the fridge in a zip-closure plastic bag, chicken pieces skinless. I wouldn't want it on the more delicate flavors of seafood, but whatever floats yer boat.

review/text: I saw all the great reviews on this item and decided to try it out myself.  I couldn't wait to cook up some jerk chicken for my friends.<br /><br />However, I was very disappointed when with the final product.  The paste itself was very salty and VERY VERY vinegary.  I thought cooking will mellow it out. It didn't.  I will not buy or even use this again.  The taste and the sharp scent of vinegar overpowers the other spices and the flavor of the meat.

review/summary: Beware the difference between Caramel and Classic Caramel
review/text: I have been round and round a bit on this.  This item and UPC are for the CLASSIC Caramel flavor from Torani.  It is terrible.  Don't get this confused with the regular/plain Caramel flavor from Torani, which is fabulous.  Make sure you note they are DIFFERENT products.<br /><br />Amazon created this Classic Caramel page based on the Caramel page, then renamed the old page to Classic Caramel as well, which is a confusing mess.  You need to ignore the reviews on the other page as they are for a different product.  The UPC 089036241397 is for Classic Caramel.  The UPC 089036241434 is for regular Caramel.  Amazon, incorrectly, kept references to Caramel on this page.  It is not!<br /><br />The taste difference between the two is shocking.  This one tastes like turpentine-soaked shoe leather.  In fact, I spit out my first cafe lattes based on this thinking it was spoiled/rotten.<br /><br />Finally, note that Amazon does not allow returns of grocery items, so be sure you like CLASSIC Caramel before you are stuck with 3 bottles of the stuff.

review/summary: Chocolate flavor doesn't come through really at all....
review/text: These aren't bad cookies, but as "chocolate chip" cookies, they are lacking.<br /><br />Each package is an appealing rather small, cute size (roughly the size of a typical package of hot dogs).  It's hard to see at first, but the front of the bag has a pull-tab, which opens a U-shaped hole on the front, and which can be re-sealed.<br /><br />The cookies are truly bite-sized, being roughly the size of a quarter.  The chocolate chips are hard to discern and, as might be expected in that case, they don't contribute much to the flavor.  Depending on the particular cookie, you may detect no chocolate flavor, or a slight hint of chocolate.  Otherwise, these have the classic old-school shortbread flavor, and are the type of shortbread that is on the firmer side, rather than being very crumbly.<br /><br />One plus is that the calorie count is low for cookies.  Well, I don't really know that much about the calories of cookies on the market; but 7 of these cookies (1 serving) is 130 calories.  Since the cookies are rich, 7 is plenty, and that sounds like a low calorie count to me.<br /><br />I don't think I would bother buying these again because for chocolate chip cookies, I want a different sort of thing.  But for shortbread cookies, they are pleasant enough.<br /><br />[Later edit to above review:  I came back to edit this review a little, as it appears that the first two bags of the pack I received were different than the third, which I just opened.  I therefore think that there may have been something wrong with the first two bags.  In the third pack, most of the cookies did actually contain visible chocolate chips, and more of them.  Even considering that, the chocolate flavor still is very faint.  I'm still not impressed enough that I would buy these again, especially considering how much variation appears to exist from bag to bag.  But I thought I should post an update to my original review.]

review/text: I am a long-time fan of butter toffee peanuts.  Nowadays, the only place I can find them is at WinnCo in their food bin section.  I LOVE the flavor of their peanuts but am skeptical to buy food in bins.  As an avid Amazon shopper, I discovered these peanuts and thought I'd give them a try.  The package arrived within the estimated date and in great condition.  However, the flavor was blah.  The toffee coating was horrible - no taste at all.  For the price, I expected them to taste at least as good as WinnCo but no such luck.  Won't be buying these again.

I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

review/text: I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.  I was going to buy Chewlotta's which take my dog about 2 hrs to go through 1, but I thought it was too pricey at $3 a pop.  My dog could eat this whole bag in less than 2 hours.  He does enjoy them though.

review/summary: My dog goes crazy for these!
review/text: My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon. I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.

Google "blue 1 adverse reactions" for a long list of complaints. Heck even the FDA issued a press release linking this petroleum derived food color as "casually linked to fatalities." Buyer beware.<br /><br />I now make our own healthy "honey Catalina" using basic pantry ingredients of water, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, sugar, onion, honey (local raw is amazing!), sea salt, Italian seasoning, garlic, black pepper, turmeric and paprika (listed in order of quantity). I blend thoroughly and freeze the extra in 1 to 2 week supply freezer containers.  This is *amazing* in taco salad recipes!

I have known Latini, Martelli, Morelli and Rustichella d'Abruzzo for many years, but this pastificio was unknown to me.<br /><br />I am enthused about the consistence of this tasty pasta. It was just right, actually it was just perfect. It was al dente, as Italians would say. But not hard inside, and not too soft either. It had this tiny resistance that you want and not often get from even good pastificie (and of course never from ordinary supermarket-bought brands!)...<br /><br />I made a version of Ratatouille in the oven, with all fresh produce, and then added the freshly cooked spaghetti to it, mingled it well. It was so delicious!<br /><br />I will order this again, and definitely also try its "brothers" (the other varieries from Faella).

review/summary: We're talking about Diet Coke -- not the price!
review/text: Okay.  I love to find good deals as much as anyone else.  But that's not the best use of the Amazon reviews!<br /><br />You can see the price of an item on Amazon right there on the computer screen.  I can see it.  Everyone can see it.  It's no secret.  What's more, it's pretty easy to compare prices online -- I don't need Amazon reviewers to tell me that they can pick it up for half the price at WalGreen or WalMart or WalWherever.  What I can't see from the little pictures on the screen (or taste, smell, touch, or hear) is the actual thing-for-sale.  I want to know about your **experience** of the item.  Does it smell funny?  Is it smaller (or bigger) than claimed?  Were the instructions impossible to follow?  You get the idea.<br /><br />I don't see the harm in mentioning that you found an item for less money somewhere else in the review -- but the actual review star-rating should be about the product itself.  When you give a multi-million (billion?) dollar product like Diet Coke a one-star rating it makes the Amazon reviews appear foolish and unreliable.  Half the world drinks Diet Coke.<br /><br />Furthermore, the price might be high for you of the pedestrian class but for those of us who can't get around all that easily getting Diet Coke delivered to our door for 45 cents per can is a lot cheaper than paying $1.50 - $2.00 each at the pop machine in the lobby (at the corner, etc.)  Shipping costs aren't free and Amazon isn't a charity.  I think they've done a pretty darned good job of keeping shipping/boxing costs to a minimum and I love my Prime membership.  Soda pop is heavy.  So when some nice, smiling young man comes toting a big box of Diet Coke to my door come snow, sleet, locusts, or frogs, and says "Can I put that inside your door?" I think I am a truly blessed woman to live in such a day and age when such things are possible.<br /><br />And now, to take my own advice...Diet Coke is a classic American experience right up there with apple pie, baseball, and baseball parks that serve Diet Coke.  We like it a lot.  We drink it like crazy.  And I don't know anyone who doesn't already have an opinion about it, but I'm giving mine anyhow.  Five stars for Diet Coke!

review/text: It took a day or two for my dog to begin playing with this bone. It's the perfect size for our 8 lb Dachshund, and it bounces (and apparently floats?) for extra fun.  The only problem we have is that its size made it easy for our dog to bury in his crate blankets, so it went unseen at bedtime.  When we woke up, we found bright blue chunks of rubber outside the crate.  Thankfully, we found all the big pieces, so no harm was done, however we found out the hard way that this is only rated a 3 of 5 on the "chomper" scale.  Our older and larger dogs would never have destroyed this, but it seems it didn't hold up for our tiny, tenacious teenager dog!  I could really smell the mint inside the chipped off areas, which was neat, so we're definitely going to try and find a 4 or 5 chomp toy from Planet Dog.  It's a nice toy for more laid back dogs, just not for intense chewers.

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: I actually loved this flavor, I bought one of each of argo tea flavors from my local store; I liked this one the most.  Im not sure what kind of tastes the other two reviewers have, but im amazed that they hated it so much.  The mint and lime mix together wonderfully, it might even mix well with gin.  I noticed the mint flavor at first, followed by a tart lime flavor at the end.  I will be buying more.<br /><br />According to the bottle its made with "Armeniam Mint tea," not black tea as one of the reviewers noted.

review/summary: Terrible, terrible stuff
review/text: I bought this because it was on sale for $1.99, I liked the bottle, and I like the taste of lime.  I quickly learned that lime does not belong in black tea, EVER.  I am cringing as I remember the flavor, it's like a cat ate a tea leaf and urinated in a mint patch at the base of a lime tree.  It reminded me of kombucha, in a bad way.  I honestly regret having to write this review but I don't want anyone to make the same mistake I did and be drawn in by the cool packaging and basic natural ingredients.

review/summary: Sucks
review/text: This stuff sucks.<br /><br />They sell it at Whole Foods for $2.50 per 13.5oz bottle, so the actual Amazon price for a 6'er isn't that bad...If you like drinking something that tastes like it shouldn't have ever been.<br /><br />A little bit of mint and lime in your tea sounds tasty, no?  No.  Incorrect.  It tastes like they took half a teabag and let it steep in a hot Mojito.  No.  That sounds sort of tasty as well.  How about, it tastes like someone mixed some tea with a Mojito, weren't satisfied, so they squeezed a couple limes into the glass to satisfy their Lime fetish.  That's close.  It's over powering.  It's nothing but lime in your face.  It tastes like it needs to be diluted before drinking.  I checked the bottle, "shake and enjoy".  No dilution required.<br /><br />Seriously, who's making these things?  Who's doing taste testing?  Who's buying $2.50 bottles of tea (Me, cause I'm stupid).<br /><br />Don't buy it.  It's "natural", it's got catchy packaging, but it sucks.  Make some sun tea in your back yard instead.

review/summary: we were disappointed...
review/text: My family loves bagels - good, chewy, hearty bagels. Living where we do, we can't always get such a thing, but we are always willing to try.  I tried these because I got a bzz campaign and my friends all said they were awesome - they'd been paying full price and eating them every day.  I thought this was great until I took my first bite.  I understand that they are supposed to be thin and all, but I was expecting it to taste like a bagel.  I did not!  It tasted like a bread end that just happened to have a hole in it.  A bagel should be boiled and baked and lots of tooth to it.  My daughter didn't care for them either (she's 7) and said the only way to eat it was to put more cream cheese on it so she couldn't taste the bagel.  So, I passed along the rest of the campaign coupons to the friends that love them.  I'll reserve my bagel eating for an occasional full size one from a place that makes them fresh.

review/summary: NOT A REAL BAGEL. Wish I could give it ZERO STARS
review/text: I bought these one day when I was craving a bagel, wanted something with whole grain, and I was, well, being lazy. I really wanted a bagel but I didn't feel like going to a bagel shop. I was already in the grocery store, walking through the bread isle, so it was an impulse buy pure and simple. In short, I was extremely disappointed. For my full review, see below.<br /><br />I have to think the only reasons anyone would give this product a good rating is either because they've never eaten a real bagel or they're in denial and are allowing themselves to think it's good because they're so desperate for a way to eat what they think is a bagel and still feel like they're eating healthy. Well, it's not a "real" bagel (not even close) and it's not even healthy. Why do I say this?<br /><br />~<br /><br />NOT A REAL BAGEL:<br /><br />The only similarities between Thomas' Bagels (or Bagel Thins) and real bagels is the round shape and the whole in the middle. Other than that these so-called bagels are nothing more than fluffy bread shaped like  a bagel. Upon close inspection and taste-testing it looks, tastes, and feels just like regular bread. It's extremely bland, even with the "whole wheat" it supposedly includes. I'm from an area of the country that makes REAL BAGELS (NYC and surrounding area) so I know what I speak of.<br /><br />True, traditional bagels should not be whole wheat, but I have eaten a whole wheat bagel made in a real bagel shop and these aren't even close to a real bagel. I've been eating true bagels made by hand for over 50 years. When you compare these things to real bagels it's almost a joke to call these things bagels.<br /><br />Bagels should be dense, chewy, and stiff. This is not. This is a limp, soft piece of floppy fluffy bread. I could ball one up in my hand like Wonder bread, that's how fluffy and soft they are. And bagels should be crispy when toasted. This is not, unless you over toast it to the point it's nearly burnt.<br /><br />~<br /><br />NOT HEALTHY:<br /><br />One of the reasons I bought these specific "bagels" was for the whole wheat. I thought it would be healthier than a regular bagel. WRONG! It contains stuff in it that I've never even heard of before and I'm sure are not "healthy" or wholesome ingredients. Like datem - what the heck is DATEM? It also contains stuff that shouldn't be in a bagel.<br /><br />~<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Basic bagels should contain wheat flour, salt, water, and yeast leavening. That's it!<br /><br />REAL BAGELS CONTAIN:<br />Wheat Flour<br />Salt<br />Water<br />Yeast<br /><br />THOMAS' CONTAINS:<br />Wheat Flour<br />Water<br />Sugar<br />Wheat Gluten<br />Flaked Wheat<br />Cellulouse Fiber<br />Cornmeal<br />Yeast<br />Wheat Bran<br />Salt<br />Preservatives (calcium propionate, sorbic acid)<br />Monoglycerides<br />Guar Gum<br />Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate<br />Datem<br />Soybean Oil<br />Soy Flour<br /><br />Now, I do realize some of the non-traditional ingredients found in these "bagels" are there because they are supposed to be a "whole wheat" product (traditional bagels are not whole wheat), but that does not excuse the Cornmeal, Guar Gum, Datem, Soy Flour, Soy Oil, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Monoglycerides, Calcium Propionate, and Sorbic Acid.<br /><br />~<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />If you want a bagel go to a bagel shop. If you live in an area where they are not made (or not made correctly) I suggest you make friends with someone in NY and ask them to send you a box of bagels. Even if you freeze them and eat them later they'll taste 100% better than any grocery store bagel I'm sure.<br /><br />I'll most likely get myself some real bagels from a real bagel shop in the near future, and when I do I'll post photos or a video that shows the difference - which will tell you a lot because these things are so bad you can tell just from a photo, you don't even have to taste them (although I did).

review/summary: Ok, so they don't taste exactly like a bagel, but...
review/text: ..If you are looking for some kind of healthy bagel-style bread to put something of top of, you have found it. Whether its cream cheese, tuna, turkey, or some type of tapenade - these versatile and virtually guilt-free rounds will do the trick. I use them all the time in place of carb and sugar loaded bread items that would normally be used and abused. I even traded them in place of biscuits and put sausage gravy on top of them. Give them a try if you love bread like I do but don't love the love handles bread helps produce. However, as others have noted, if you really need a chewy deli-style bagel, you may want to skip these and hit the deli. But don't skip the gym. :)

review/text: I got the coupon for the Thomas Bagel Thins from Bzz Agent was a little Skeptical as they are thin.  But I must say for the money I really enjoyed them, the one thing I will say is be careful of over toasting them.  But other then that I think for 110 calories they are well worth the money.  Usually low fat stuff is not that good but I totally enjoyed them with a smidge of Cream Cheese.  And I will say the price is definitely right for them.  I am a New Yawker and I love my bagels and I love these,not too dry just perfect.

I received a coupon to try them as a Bzz Agent so my husband and I tried them and now eat them all the time.  They are much thinner than a regular bagel(and have a great crunch if toasted), but only have 110 calories (vs. up to 500 in a regular bagel). They are great for breakfast toasted with butter, cream cheese or peanut butter, for a sandwich at lunch or even as a snack - toasted and dipped in hummus.

I tried them toasted, plain, with lots of cream cheese, as a sandwich--just not to my liking. The whole wheat had a sweetish-bitter flavor to it, which I was also not fond of.<br /><br />I love their English muffins, and was quite disappointed. I ended up giving the rest of my coupons to others to try, and in all fairness, many other folks like them. Just didn't do anything for me.

review/summary: Best chai we've found yet
review/text: We first discovered chai lattes on one of our trips. When we got home, we started looking for a way to make it ourselves. We went through a bunch of brands before finding Celestial Seasonings Original Indian Teahouse. This stuff is the best. Great aroma, better flavor, and strong enough to hold its taste when mixed with soy milk. Add a banana and you've got a light, flavorful, well-balanced breakfast. We mix the tea in batches so it's ready when we want it.<br />Here's our recipe: 4 cups water, one box Celestial Seasonings India Tea House chai microwaved on high for 7 minutes and left to steep 6-24 hours. Remove the teabags, squeezing the liquid from them so you have 3 cups of concentrated chai. Heat in microwave 1 to 1-1/2 minutes on high, add one cup honey. Combine two cups of chai with a half-gallon of soy milk and voila! Chai soy latte on demand.

review/text: I heard a lot about Chai tea and was very curious. The one from Celestial is the only one I tried so far but I have to say it is great. As said in the instructions, replace a 1/4 of the hot water with milk. I love my tea with a lot of milk but while it usually weakens the taste, milk is mandatory here. Due to this it even convinced a person who rejected tea before as 'coloured hot water'. Actually, it resembles a bit a light latte with a hint of cinnamon and cardamom. Yummy!

review/summary: Better than Chocolate
review/text: I know some would disagree, but I find this India Spice tea more satisfying than eating chocolate.<br />I only recently experienced India Spice Chai Tea in an Indian restaurant and loved it.  After trying several brands, Celestial Seasonings India Spice came closest to matching the Indian restaurant tea which they made fresh with loose tea leaves and ground spices.  I brew for 5 minutes, then add 1 part heated milk to 3 parts brewed tea.  Little sugar is required.<br />The only drawback to this product is that it does not appear to be stocked in grocery stores, even though the India Spice decaf is.  I count on Amazon grocery to continue to stock this item.

review/summary: A beautiful Chai with lots of caffeine.
review/text: This is the best pre-packaged Chai I've ever found.  Sure, you can get some really amazing blends in loose leaf, but they are expensive.  The clove in this blend really blends well with the pepper and nutmeg.  The flavor is bold but smooth.  It's also very high in caffeine and makes a great tea to sip on in the morning.  If you really want to treat yourself, add some sweetened condensed milk to it.  It's so good, it's a dessert all on its own.<br /><br />As a regular hot tea drinker, the economics involved in drinking prepackaged teas are an important consideration for me. As a result, I try to get 2 servings out of each tea bag whenever possible. For this variety, I can get 2 decent sized servings out of each bag though the second serving is a little diluted. It is still a good cup of tea. Celestial Seasonings tea bags do not come equipped with a string due to environmental considerations and to ensure that nothing compromises the flavor of the tea (like a metal staple on a tag).<br /><br />This is a flavor worth putting on my "Subscribe & Save" list.  My retail price in local stores for one box of this tea is $3.59.

review/summary: CS Chai is the Best!
review/text: For some reason, the Celestial Seasonings Chai Tea is hard for me to find. I have tried about 5 other brands, including all the major and some regional tea brands, and nothing else compares to this blend. Thanks for making this readily available and at a great price.<br /><br />Service was really fast and everything arrived in perfect condition.

review/summary: Just what chai should be
review/text: After trying several brands of chai, including Bigelow, Stash, and even some expensive Tazo, I have settled on this Celestial Seasonings blend. Most chais I find to be either too bitter or bland. This one is neither. The cinnamon and vanilla add just the right note of sweetness. If you have never been a fan of chai, try Celestial Seasonings India Spice, and you might just change your mind! I can't get enough and I hope they never stop making it!
