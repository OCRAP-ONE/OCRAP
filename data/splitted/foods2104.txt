review/summary: Going back to this brand...
review/text: My picky, finicky Chow Chow could barely be coaxed to eat any of the other foods I bought for her until I brought home a bag of Orijen. You would have been under the impression that I was giving her a bowl of raw (or cooked) meat if you saw her eat it and didn't know better. I've been using the brand for years now until recently due to the economy I've purchased a couple bags of high quality, less expensive food for my Pit Bull who has always had a healthy appetite... not too picky, so I thought it wouldn't make a difference, but after a few weeks now he's been throwing up bile the last three or four days in a row, and just today he threw up his food, so I'm going back to Orijen for him. I noticed there is some pro-biotic ingredients in the Orijen brand as well, so that may make the difference. Either way, I've trusted Orijen since my Chow gave me the "tails up" years ago! I also found satisfaction that Orijen was never on the dog food recall list several years ago when pets were dieing from a cheapened ingredient filler coming from a source that people hadn't known about prior... so I trust the makers.

review/summary: Excellent Quality!
review/text: When I first adopted my dog, I did a vast amount of research to find out what was truly best to feed him. He's a chihuahua mix, and as I was reading such mixed reviews about whether small dogs would benefit from a high protein diet or not I decided I just had to try it for myself. He did have a little trouble with digestion while I was transitioning him to the food, he was eating Royal Canin prior. He's been eating it for about seven months now and he's doing phenomenal. He has great muscle tone and energy. His coat is silky and shinny when it had been coarse and dull. Yes, it's on the pricey side but if you closely watch what you put in your body as humans why wouldn't you want your best friend to benefit from great food.

review/summary: BEST DOG FOOD ON THE MARKET! 10 STARS!
review/text: This is absolutely the best dog food on the market. No doubt about it. I am one of those persons who feeds his dog only the best. I eat high quality food, and I would never do less for my dog. I feed this to my labrador, and she loves it. We have tried other high quality brands -- such as Evo. While Evo is a great food, Orijen is just better. You can tell the difference. My dog is in perfect health. She is active. She has tons of energy. And her coat and teeth are radiant. People compliment her coat all the time. She is perfect. Orijen has changed her life. I will NEVER stop using this food!<br /><br />When she was younger, I used the puppy version as well. She loves this stuff. Eats is quickly and always wants more. The only thing she likes more than Orijen is my grilled chicken breast!<br /><br />Finally, if your dog has any issues with seizures, this is probably the best food on the market for your buddy. Do research on the web. And believe me -- you'll see the difference.

Our vet strongly approves of Orijen and our Westie loves it!  She had skin allergies and this has Omega 3's, fresh fish, good quality protein, minimal fat, no fillers or junk.  Her skin itching is gone!

review/summary: One of the best dog foods you can buy.
review/text: I have been feeding my dogs Orijen for over two years now.  I was at a bar with a buddy and he was telling me how he switched his food to Evo and so I did some research on better dog foods.  I decided on Orijen.  I can't really tell if my dogs coats are better or they are more healthy.  On paper it seems to be the best food and it makes sense.  The food is sooo expensive and they jacked up the price about 6 months ago.  It does help they seem to eat half as much as my old dog food.  So, that cuts the cost in half compared to my old food.  A big bonus of this is there is half as much poop to pick up. That is huge as I am really lazy.  The other thing I noticed is both dogs had some nasty farts.  That pretty much stopped on Orijen.  Oddly my buddy said it will get worse with the higher protein diet, but it got a ton better.  I mean by dogs could drop some room clearing farts.  There are cheaper good dog foods out there like Blue.  I have thought about switching to it because it is 30 bucks a bag cheaper.  For now Evo is worth the money.  I can drop 70 bucks at a bar on any given night.  70 a month feeds both my large dogs.

review/summary: AWESOME FOOD!!!
review/text: I switched over to Orijen Adult formula almost a year ago (next month is my free bag...yay!) and I couldn't be happier. My 2-year-old boxer, Cooper, thrives on it. His coat is shiny and glossy, his eyes clear and white, and he has more energy than any other dog at the dog park. I'm not at all sure it's because of this food, but he lost some weight last spring and has since been a lean, mean, muscle machine. I'm talking LEAN. The vet says he's fine, and although I get lots of comments on how skinny my dog is, the proof is in the pudding. No dog can outlast Cooper, and he's just so incredibly healthy, I don't mind some bones sticking out. It's better than being overweight. He's an athlete. I think when I got him off grains last spring, his body shed some weight that it obviously didn't need. I would highly recommend this food! He loves it...I can even use the kibbles as treats. Combined with Grizzly Salmon Oil, I hope Cooper lives a long and healthy life!

review/summary: Amazing rocket fuel for dogs
review/text: My 6 year old cardigan welsh corgi was originally on Eukanuba, which was recommended by our vet. But she had dry skin, a dull coat and not as much energy as a dog her age should have. She also tended to become a bit overweight on it.<br /><br />Based on a recommendation from a corgi breeder & my own research into the premium brands, I decided to try Orijen. What a difference! Her coat is now quite shiny and healthy looking. No more dry skin. Lots of energy, and she has lost a bit of weight & looks more muscular & healthy overall.<br /><br />She also loves the taste - no problem getting her to eat it. But feed according to how your dog looks, not how much it says on the bag. This is high protein stuff & your dog will gain weight if you feed according to package directions. My 25lb corgi (yes, she's a bit on the petite side), gets only 1/2 cup twice a day.<br /><br />No, the initial purchase price is NOT cheap. But because we feed so much less (no grains or fillers), a bag lasts just as long as what we were spending on Eukanuba. FYI - I just got a bag of their 6 fish food to try & she is wild over it.

review/summary: So far, so good!
review/text: My dog has eaten this food for 19 days. So far he has not gotten an ear infection, but still shows redness on his paws. He loves this food. He somehow could smell it through this lovely packaging and followed me around while it was carying through the house. His appetite also matches the recommended serving suggestion, which is wonderful. I am going to order another bag, so we can see if the paw and mouth allergies go away. He may have a food and environmental allergy as well. I feel good about the ingredients and how my dog responds to the food. I think this bag will end up lasting an entire month or very close to it.<br /><br />The shipping was also super fast, so not only am I happy with the food, but the seller as well!

I have allergies and my skin gets very itchy and mommy worries about me. So, she took me to the vet and that's where we heard about Orijen. It's super tasty! I can't wait for mealtime! My skin feels better and I have more pep in my step! Plus, mommy says that it's cheaper and easier on her than making me special food, and by feeding me Orijen, she knows I'm getting all the vitamins I need to grow up a strong happy doggie! I give Orijen four paws up- I'd give it five but I only have four (LOL)!

review/summary: Orijen - Champion Dog Food Award 2011-2012 , Washington, DC
review/text: First of all, to those afraid their dog will get to much protein from the best quality dog foods ..feed your dog according to his weight and instructions on the bag! Use caution and research for his daily needs according to his weight if feeding high protein wet & dry food at the same time in seperate bowls. If you dont, don't blame Orijen if he gets elevated liver enzymes. Blame yourself for not doing your homework!<br />Glycemic Research Institute, Washington, D.C has awarded Orijen another Pet Food of the Year award. For those not familiar w/ this institite, they also do clinical investigations for our gov.

review/text: Actually caused my dog to have bad diarrhea.  We have a border collie who has been on a raw diet due to allergies and we wanted to try a grain free kibble to see if it would be easier to travel with.  She liked it first time and then not so much for the next two times and then the loose stools began. I think the quality of the food is good - but not sure what is causing this side effect. Had to stop and go back to raw food supplemented with Sojo's grain free.

review/summary: Quality, not Quantity...
review/text: ...because it is FAR too expensive in quantity! :)<br /><br />Orijen dry dog food is rich in proteins as it is nearly 100% meat from a variety of pure sources: chicken, fish, etc.<br />We mix this dog food during the dinner feed 50/50 with lesser grade Iams Healthy Choices as I'm not so sure a pure Orijen diet is a good idea for our aging Rottweiler. The food smells very strong and it is a very dark color - very different than lower-grade commercial dry dog food.<br /><br />The bag is sealed when it arrives, and has a very good shelf life while sealed (air-tight) in the bag. When opened, poor the bag into a sealable (air-tight) container for storage and keep in a cool, dry place.<br /><br />The dog food is so expensive, one could actually cook fresh food for the dog at lesser cost. But there is an advantage in dry dog food in that it is more convenient, and the kiblets help to keep the dogs teeth clean.

review/summary: Balance is everything
review/text: My Beagle was a troublesome eater. I did research and found Orijen but feared what a high Protein diet might do to my little Diva. So, I used innovation. I mix frozen green beans, chopped up apple, broccoli, and Kir yogurt or a small can of Chef Michael and mix it with her food. The cost of Orijen is irrelevant because as many of you have said I use a small amount of it. By adding different vegetables and fruit, everyday she has a unique meal. Polo is a beautiful animal and is exceedingly happy with no health problems, and my mind is at peace.  One size does not fit all but with a little creativity you can have your own win-win.

review/summary: good quality per my research but price... jeez
review/text: I'm giving 4 stars to this product because the price is sooo high.<br />But I would say this food is good quality per my research.<br />I used to feed my dogs with "puppy chow" and later when they got older "dog chow"<br />I have parrots and I always researched for the best food for them because I was a first time parrot owner. While I was researching for my parrots food I started to think about my dogs... so I realized I may have dogs for years but I never took the time to check their food.<br />Dog Chow is a very popular brand and I always though it was at least an average quality for my dogs that also eat fresh home made food.<br />I researched and find out that good part of the food is made by corn!!!! I felt so guilty for my babies and I started to look which dog food would be more recommended.<br />I ended up finding this web site: [...]<br />Based on the reviews and information found on the website above I decided to buy orijen and also Instinct.<br />Problem is that my babies tummy is used with "dog chow" and I know they can get sick with this new food even it's the best quality you can get. So I'll just start to mix a little bit with the "dog chow" until they get used with orijen and instinct.<br />If you are one person that knows how to prepare balanced and nutritious fresh home made food for dog I would say to stick on that. There is no processed food that is better than a fresh food. The trick about home made food is that you need to know how to prepare to cover all your dogs needs, if you don't know to do that you may ended up giving less nutritional food than a processed food can give to your dog.<br />Again, something I told before in a review. Please be responsible on caring and loving your animal. Remember you have friends and family, your pet has only you. You may live beyond 70 years old, you dog will have only 10 years to enjoy his life and will totally depend of you to be happy and healthy.

review/text: You know how you are supposed to transition gradually to a new food? When I first started to switch my dog to this, she picked out all the new pieces and left the old stuff behind. (old stuff=Blue Buffalo). Now I usually prefer raw but will feed kibble because of convenience, but only Orijen or Acana (both made by Champion Pet Foods in Alberta). Orijen uses all fresh, human grade ingredients, with no grains, animal by-products, unnamed meat sources, or anything else I don't want in my food.<br /><br />Champion Pet Foods is an award-winning boutique manufacturer who does not outsource any stage of production or buy any supples from Chia. They are passionate about pet nutrition and the proof is on the kibble. It is highly palatable, nutritious, and safe.<br /><br />It is pricy and distribution is not as good as some, but well worth the extra effort and expense.

You can even tell by the smell when you open the bag that this is a kibble made of quality products.  It will take time to see how their coats react to the new food, but so far the fact that they are both eating it with gusto is proof enough for me!!!

review/summary: Incredible ingredients but pricey.
review/text: The first time I read the ingredient list for this food I said: "Son of a... I WOULD EAT THIS!" No joke, there isn't a single ingredient name you won't recognize and there are no artificial preservatives. I have yet to meet a dog owner (in person!) who hasn't told me their dog eats this stuff like it's crack-cocaine!<br /><br />As it is a little pricey (despite the fact that you actually have to feed your dog LESS food than any other brand with a high grain content (which is used as a filler)) I do a half-and-half mix of Orijen with another incredible dry dog food called "Taste of the Wild".<br /><br />All I can say is that my Siberian Husky LOVES this food so much that when she's done she just sits there looking at me for a minute before letting out a very satisfying belch. Finally, I can also say, and this is only anecdotal, but after I switched to this food (I was formerly feeding her Eukanuba) my dog's shedding decreased significantly.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand to anyone with a medium to large breed dog that has a high-energy level.

review/summary: The only dry food I feed my dogs
review/text: I found Orijen by reading online veterinary recommendations for the best dog foods -- dry and canned. Several reviewers put Orijen at the top of their lists, and it was almost always included in the top five. My dogs have been very healthy on this food -- and they like it. On the rare occasion when I had to switch to another dry food (another highly rated brand) because Orijen had not arrived in the mail, I noticed stomach upset and less enthusiasm about the food. In this household, at least, Orijen is the only dry food in the dog bowl.

review/summary: Why?
review/text: This is the second bag of Orijen grain-free adult dry dog food I have purchased. The first was gobbled up by my little Papillon.The second bag has caused her to have diarrhea,and throw up. I have smelled the food and it does have a sour odor. My daughter who lives in Austin,Texas buys this food for her dog and has had no problem. She buys locally. There is not a store in Amarillo,Texas which carries this brand. Could something have happened in the shipping of this food to me? The vet put her on Carafate and Amoxi which seem to cure the diarrhea. However, she will not touch the dog food now and I have been giving her Prescription Diet i/d (gastrointestinal health). I am puzzled. The date code is good, and the first bag was fine. I would appreciate any feedback you have on this product.

review/summary: Too rich
review/text: I fed my champion Shetland Sheepdogs this food for over six months.  A few of my dogs did alright on it but others had loose stools and lost on average 2 pounds from the previous year. Upon giving more food to gain weight the dog's got even looser stools.  I e-mailed the company about it and never got a reply. Coats were shiny but not good enough for show competition.  Since taking my dogs off this food they have gained weight and coats are coming in to the point I can show them again soon.  I do like the philosphies of this company with regards to ingredients but makes me wonder if no grain at all is such a great thing.

review/summary: Dangerous food
review/text: I am a K9 police officer for a fairly large police department.  One of our local pet stores recently started selling Orijens dog food and told us of its high quality.  It was supposed to be ideal for large active dogs.  Six officers transitioned their K9s to this food.  Five of those six officers have had to take their dogs off of it.  Two dogs nearly died from gastric and liver problems.  These two had to spend days overnight at the vet, one required extensive surgery to save him.  The other three also had gastric problems, but did not require medical attention before they were taken off the food.  All of the dogs experienced problems within a month, or even just a few days after transition to Orijens food.  Only one of the six dogs not experience a problem.  Use caution with this food and monitor your dogs for signs of bloat.  We will never recommend this product.

review/summary: Very realistic looking orchid
review/text: This orchid looks exactly like the natural one, of the very same kind, I have. I have them sitting next to each other and can hardly tell them apart. When the natural one is in bloom, its flowers are slightly larger, but the color, shape and even texture are virtually indistinguishable.<br /><br />Real orchids bloom once or twice a year and their flowers last a very long time (months), but it also takes the plant a few months to start producing buds again so, during this time, the fake orchids provide that beautiful splash of color. Six lovely orchids on my windowsill and no one can ever tell that some of them are fakes. :)<br /><br />Very good value, too.<br /><br />TIP: Place a bamboo stick next to the stem and secure it with a couple of little butterfly clips, as the real orchids have. ;)

This isn't meant to be for an easter basket for a 10 year old. Enjoy this stuff slowly, and it will reward you; the finish on this stuff is fabulous. I don't even really like chocolate, but something like this that's original, not too sweet, and has a lavendar finish, is an exception.

review/summary: Better than many choices out there
review/text: While this isn't my very top choice of cat foods available, it has worked very well as a transition food for the six months that we need an all-stages food until our kitten gets older.  When she was very small, we were able to give her her own kitten food by setting up her feeding station in a box that our adult cat couldn't get into.  Now that they are the same size, we can't keep them from stealing each other's food, so we needed something they could both eat.  We tried a couple of holistic all-stages foods, and this one has been the best, by far.  Both cats prefer the little "T" shape kibble over round kibble, they seem to enjoy the taste, and it keeps them and their digestive systems happy ... and that keeps ME happy.  ;-)  My older cat does better on a grain-free food, and has gotten a case of the itchies on this food, but it is not nearly as bad as with most grain-inclusive foods we've tried.  Once kitten is old enough, they will both be back on a grain-free diet.  In the meantime, this has really fit our needs.

review/summary: Put good in, get good out
review/text: CLIFFS: 100% Recommended from a paranoid, research crazy owner who wanted nothing but the best for my kitten.<br /><br />FULL REVIEW: My kitten loves this food. As with all kitten/cats you learn they have personalities, specific tastes and favorites.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time researching cat food and discovered so much BAD food out there.<br /><br />THE KEY TO KEEPING YOUR CAT HEALTHY IS GOOD FOOD AND EXERCISE, READ THE INGREDIANTS, THE FIRST 5 ITEMS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND ARE THE LARGEST PORTIONS OF THE FOOD.<br /><br />Research indicates this is one of the best all around foods you can feed your cat/kitten. We started with K****nchow, which in the word of cat food is about a 5 outa 10 in quality, its got the #'s but not the wholesome natural ingredients from which they derive. Think about taking a vitamin vs. eating veggies.<br /><br />This brand doesn't pack the most protein (which is crucial to cat development) but its well over the recommended amount, and quiet frankly, I'm not comfortable with a heavy protein diet, I believe there can be too much of a good thing.<br /><br />This grain free food also has lots of actual vegetables and items you can identify in the food itself.<br /><br />This food smells almost fit for human consumption, you can pick up the flavors just by the scent, doesn't smell like typical big brand crap.<br /><br />Many reviews claim softer and shinier coat and I have to agree. I've had a few cats the past 20yrs and hers by far is the softest coat I've ever felt.<br /><br />What I find great is she ignored the K****nchow when wet was out, but now will often choose this to snack on when the wet food has been out a hour or 2.<br /><br />This is good on her stomach and stools are not overly smelly like they were on other brand food we started initially. The food itself doesn't overly smell either.<br /><br />Provides plenty of lasting energy too.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased and could not recommend it more. Pricier? Of course. But its absolutely worth it at the rate she eats this. A bag this size lasts our kitten at least 4 months. For 30 bucks?! Why not?!

review/summary: Our 3 Cats Love This Food
review/text: We have 3 cats that didn't seem to be enjoying their food very much--even though we'd tried several varieties. We received a sample of this food from our veterinarian and they acted like it was a real treat. So we decided to try a large bag and see if they acted more interested. Sure enough, they became more excited about eating. Since it is a bit pricey for our cat food budget, we mix it half and half with the less expensive food. They always pick this out to eat first. We'll be buying more for them.

review/summary: Preferred Choice to Supplement a Canned Food Diet.
review/text: I tried a few dry food brands after the pet food recall of 2007.  I tried some grain free, and noticed some problems from the cats.  I tried going all wet - but apparently - my 17 yo needs some of the grains in dry food,  Their main food of choice (I'm not much of one for switching - had trouble with Turkey and Salmon flavors) is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>.<br /><br />I started with this Dry when it was Eagle Pack Holistic Select.  The formula was EU certified (which has a higher degree of ingredient integrity than US pet foods).  Since then, this company merged with the new owners of Wellness - so the 2 brands can compliment each other.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />EDIT: 3/24/2011<br />I've switched some things up since the Wellness problems (and still waiting for Wellness Chicken Recipe to Return).<br /><br />I have started rotation feeding wet food, and have found that I use less dry food than before - here is my general shopping list:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Will be giving the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> a try.<br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don't like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a> (Also not grain free, and Multi protein source. It does contain Herring. However, cats have reacted positively to this food).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />This is why I prefer the smaller bag.  Except for the removal of additional Vitamin K (google on that one), the ingredients haven't changed much since I started in 2008 (when it was EU certified).  For saving Vet Bills - it pays to have kitties on a high quality diet.<br /><br />PS - the bag comes with its own zip lock closure, I've never had a problem with spoilage nor a-toxins.<br />PPS - some have found this a good rotation ONLY, it eases the budget: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.

review/text: I bought this flavor by accident as I had been buying the anchovy, sardine, salmon meal version of Holistic Select over the past year, and I wasn't paying attention. The chicken is $2 less than the anchovy & sardine one, but both our cats seem to like the anchovy & sardine better. Overall I will stick with Holistic Select because I believe it to be a high quality cat food, and worth the premium. One of our cats will not eat moist food if his life depended on it so we went with this brand which seems to be one of the best dry foods on the market. I just placed an order for the duck meal Holistic Select so we shall see if that one is a hit too.

review/text: We have 5 cats and when we fed them other dry cat foods (several brands) that contained corn or corn products (genetically modified, I'm sure) and wheat or wheat glutin), we would find one or more throw-ups on the floor just about every morning.  We eventually figured out it was the dry cat food.  We started feeding them Holistic Select which is corn and wheat free. Now we seldom find throw-up and if we do, it's because of hair balls.  What a difference!  We have been sold on Holistic Select Adult and Kitten Health food for the past year and we will continue to use it even though it is a bit costly compared to the other dry foods we were using.  My son and daughter have also switched and experienced the same results.

review/summary: A food that works for both new kitten and fussy adult cat
review/text: My 8 year old cat is one of the fussiest eaters on the planet. She will not even touch a food if she sniffs it and decides she doesn't like the smell of it. I have tried the tactic of just leaving it out and not giving her any other options for food and she just ends up starving. She has been eating a cheap brand of dry cat food with ingredients that I now know are just horrific for cats her whole life. The first five ingredients were brewer's rice, chicken by-product meal, corn meal, chicken fat and soybean meal. As you can probably see, this is a food I was desperate to get her off of. She has also been a very skittish cat and would often have anxiety attacks about seemingly nothing. Like, at the very slightest noise she would literally jump 4 feet in the air from fear and if you were near her or touching her when it happened she would unintentionally scratch you to ribbons in her mad dash to get away. I was sad when this happened because normally she is such a gentle cat and has never bit me in her life, there is no way she would scratch unless she was terrified and completely out of her mind. I had an inkling that the junk food might be exacerbating this problem, much like how gluten and dairy could exacerbate the problems of autistic children.<br /><br />All of my attempts up until now have ended up in failed attempts and money wasted on food she wouldn't eat. This happened again and again and I almost thought it was a lost cause until Holistic Select chicken meal formula. We recently rescued a kitten off the streets and I knew I didn't want to start feeding her the same junk that my older cat had been eating for years. I was looking up some grain-free formulas and decided to go with one of those brands since cats shouldn't really be eating grains. To make a long story short, both the kitten and cat didn't like it. The kitten will nibble on it if there are no other options (she's easier to please, thank goodness), so I've kept it around and leave it out so there's something out when their other food is gone, but all in all, not a success by any means. I had a sample packet of Holistic Select chicken meal lying around that I received probably about a year ago and never got around to giving to my cat and the kitten got at it and bit away at the packaging to get the food inside. I looked at the ingredient list and hey, not too bad! I hoped beyond hope and offered some to my older cat and she eagerly ate it! Hallelujah!<br /><br />So I quickly bought a bag from Amazon and prayed that she would continue eating it. Well, I am now down to a quarter of the bag and I recently had to reorder. Both of the cats eat it with no problems and my older cat actually has far less anxiety attacks. She seems much more calm and is now willing to let my husband come up to her without running away in fear. He can even pet her a little. This is a miraculous change than just a few months ago when the mere sight of him had her diving under the bed. I have recently been eating healthier and I know what a difference it makes for me and there is no difference with our pets. What we feed them has a drastic affect on their well-being and behavior. This is not the absolute best food out there, but it's pretty darn good. I have recently ordered some wet food cans from Holistic Select since I know little kitten will go crazy over that and it's good to supplement the diet with some wet.

It is the only food that gives him perfectly normal bowel movements. (Yes, even tried blue buffalo and a few other expensive products). I recommend this food to everyone for their animals with delicate stomachs. Plus, it doesn't hurt that he absolutely loves it and the unique shape makes him chew it rather than swallow it whole which means it's good for his teeth too!

review/text: I recently began drinking Blue Thunder drinks again after a several year hiatus. I've found that this is a good 'pick-me-up' drink during the workout, and, have been enjoying them as a snack during the day. Post-workout, I still enjoy chocolate milk (or milk, generally)--which I still maintain is one of the best drinks for building strength and mass. But Blue Thunders certainly have their place, and I think they're particularly good when you put them in the freezer for awhile and let them get some ice crystals--tastes like a popsicle during these hot days here in the mid-Atlantic. You won't find a better deal than Amazon's 'Subscribe and Save' either. These things are too expensive if you try to buy them at a retail store, or, have to pay shipping on RTD products at most online shops. Thanks, Amazon.

review/summary: A tender bean with many uses
review/text: The Eden Cannellini beans have a nice texture and a simple flavor that blends well with other foods. I also find them more digestible than some other beans.<br /><br />Good mashed as well as whole, I have used them in place of tahini with garbanzo beans to make a nice, light hummos, mashed them and mixed them with seafood and herbs/spices to make a South-American (Brazilian?) style fritter (dried shrimp is traditional I gather, but anything you like can be good -- the beans hold everything together and are mild enough to let the other flavors shine through. Lightly dredging in flour gives you a crisper surface if you decide to try it...), and more.

review/summary: Good quality beans - no BPA
review/text: I guess the title says it all.  Some beans (like pintos) are as good or better when soaked from dry and cooked at home than the canned version, but I much prefer canned cannellini beans.  I use them in Italian tuna/bean salad and in soups.  The cans drain easily.  There could be a few more beans in each can and a bit less liquid, but all in all they are most satisfactory.  I feel a lot healthier knowing I'm not getting any BPA poisons along with my tasty white beans.<br /><br />We eat very little meat so it is important to me to use the best beans, and in my opinion Eden brand is the best.

review/summary: Great canned product without excessive salt or harmful chemicals/preservatives!
review/text: I LOVE these canned cannellini beans. They are organic, which is important to me, and do not contain any of the harmful chemicals/preservatives that so many canned products have. I also love the fact that there is no salt added, another hard to find quality in canned goods.<br /><br />While I do prefer to make my own beans from scratch, when in a pinch, these serve me well. I have never been disappointed in the quality of the product or experienced the problems that a couple of the other reviewers have had. The beans always come out creamy and delicious...they are good enough to eat on salads (after a rinse of course).<br /><br />The Subscribe & Save option is great for these, too, because it works out to be less than what I would pay in my local grocery store for the same product. Plus, buying products by the case is not only easier, but it leads to a well-stocked pantry. I will always keep these beans on hand.<br /><br />I love Eden Organic products, but this is definitely my favorite!

review/summary: Great baby food!
review/text: When my 4 month old son sees these brightly colored pouches he sits straight up in his high chair and starts to get excited. All the flavors are really yummy. ... I've tried everything that he's eaten at this point.<br /><br />I really like that these have no additives... They didnt even add water. Just pure organic fruit and vegetable pur&eacute;e. I figure that he's going to have so many processed food options in the future that I might as well give him the best I can now.<br /><br />I purchased the Boon Spoons (got a 3 pack of the 2-spoon sets from the big T for less than a 2 pack here on amazon) and they work perfectly with these pouches too. Very convenient to take on the go.<br /><br />I continue to purchase these pouches, though I usually buy a couple individual packs from T before buying the 7 packs here on Amazon so I can make sure he likes them.

review/summary: great for sensitive tummys!
review/text: Our baby started refusing to eat.  She was having really bad stomach pains.  She was put on reflux medicine, but still after a few weeks would not eat "regular" baby food.  I took a chance and bought some brown rice and bananas and figured I'd give it a try.  When I opened the pouch I was surprised at how "banana-ee" the food smelled.  The color was a bit odd, and the texture rather smooth and runny so I was having second thoughts on trying it out with baby.  I figured she wasn't going to like but gave it a chance.  I am so glad I did.  She LOVED it.  She ate the entire pouch.  The best part, she didn't get sick. I have two other flavors but I am sticking to the roasted bananas and brown rice a bit longer so she gets over her anxiety with eating.  I love that there is some cinnamon in the food.  I have never understood why we feed such bland food.  I am so happy to have stumbled upon this baby food! Thank-you Tyler!

review/summary: not happy w/ package
review/text: I bought a few of these at the grocery store b/c  I liked the food combos and there just isn't a lot to choose from in organic baby food category-let's face it! Unfortunately, the bag burst where you open it while it was still sitting in the pantry. The food got onto the other bags and the box where I had her food organized in. I decided that I couldn't trust the packaging. I am sure there was bacteria the container that burst and I was afraid to trust the rest since I bought additional packages of the same flavor. I ended up buying Earth Best and dealing w/ limited flavors.<br /><br />On a side note I'm also not happy w/ some of the Gerber organics either. I don't like the fact that they put tuna oil in the DHA items. The tuna oil isn't listed as organic and I am concerned that the fish are farm raised and fed harmful medications b/c of the conditions. Not something I want to give my daughter...<br /><br />I ended up making my own baby food b/c I wanted it to have a more chunky feel to it even though it takes time. I signed up for organic delivery and use Earth Best to flavor pasta and cous cous and to add the extra veggies into her diet when I'm running behind.

review/summary: Powder is better value
review/text: I think the K20 protein drinks are fantastic. I am a vegetarian and am always looking for ways to supplement my protein intake.<br /><br />I first tried the actual bottled drinks for K2O; I was disappointed that there was only about 5g of protein (about 2/3 cup of milk), but when I tried the drink and found, not only no aftertaste as many of the other protein drinks out there have, but excellent flavors... I was hooked. My problem is that even in bulk... they were priced at around $2 a bottle (around $24 for 12 bottles) which is out of my budget.<br /><br />Then came the powders which you can just mix in a 16-20 oz cup or bottle of water. If I buy a case of bulk water at my local warehouse for around $5 (or just use filtered water at home) the cost for 28 bottles is now anywhere from about $5-$10 less than the price of only 12 premixed bottles. Plus they are significantly easier to transport to work.<br /><br />Now I have the best of all worlds... added protein to my vegetarian diet... low calorie, great tasting drinks... and a very reasonable price. I have them on subscription now!

review/text: I like the lemonade flavor and there is no icky aftertaste. This is a great way to quench your thirst and fend off the munchies at the same time. When mixed as instructed I think it is a little too sweet for my taste, although I don't really like sweets to start with.  I usually mix one packet of this with 32oz of water so it is not so sweet for me. By the time I finish that, I am full for about 4-5 hours. One little packet gives you 5 grams of protein and only 30 calories. This is also more economical that purchasing the premixed bottled of protein water. Since I am always carrying a bottle of water, I can always dump a packet of this in if I want something different.

review/text: I found this at my local store and thought I would try it. I thought it kinda smelled funny while I was mixing it, and it kind of has a jello-ish taste to it, which makes sense because I think gelatin is a protein. I did almost have to force myself to drink it. It wasn't the taste so much as the smell I couldn't get over. So I had to get on here and read reviews to see if it's all in my head, and maybe it is. Overall, I would say that it's ok because it does have the protein and fiber and adding those will change the taste of most things.<br /><br />And yes, it contains Splenda, for anyone thinking it does not.

review/summary: Very Sweet
review/text: Let me begin by stating that my usual drink is water.  I also drink unsweetened coffee and tea and rarely drink juice or soda.  This may be why I found this mix too sweet.  The actual flavor is fine, but if you put the entire pouch in only 16-20oz of water as directed, it is hard to finish.  I tried to put the whole pouch into 32oz of water and still found that it was sweet.  I have finally settled on a 1/2 pouch for 32oz of water.  Unfortunately, that's not going to get me my 5 grams of fiber and protein quickly to curb any hunger.  So I think I'll just drink the rest of my packs for flavoring rather than hunger curbing and stick to other lean proteins to take care of that.

review/text: Ritz has nothing over these delicious crackers.  My favorite snack is these 'snackers' lightly smeared with natural butter (I know, I know)  Sometimes I have them plain, sometimes with peanut butter.  Great for appetizers (try a thin slice of cucumber, sprinkled with coarse ground black pepper corns).  Kids love them with lemon curd or fruit preserves.  Try them, they really are delicious!

review/summary: Not for Keurig ... Update
review/text: Just received the item, great delivery as usual by Amazon. Was very disappointed, though, to open the package to find that these are not Keurig-type pods, and that you need to purchase an additional accessory to use them in the Keurig (order form for the accessory is "conveniently" included with the coffee). If you have a Keuring, this is not the product for you, unless you want to buy the accessory. Unless I missed it, there is no indication in the product description that this is not the now-ubiquitous Keurig pod, nor that you also needed the separate accessory. Manufacturer should be more transparent; felt like I had been "baited and switched." Will be returning, sorry I wasted my time.<br /><br />Update: Now that I am initiated in to the terminology of one-cup coffee, it is clear that I was the uninformed one. I did break down and purchase the accessory to brew in the Keurig. The coffee was well-packaged and delivered on time, and the accessory to brew in the Keurig worked like a charm. The coffee didn't have the taste of fresh-gound Kona, but did have the light flavor of a Kona-style coffee. I would order it again (especially since I have the accessory now!). Sorry for my ignorance.

review/summary: weak coffee
review/text: I ordered a box of this plus the adapter for a Keurig when I couldn't find the Tully's Kona that I normally order.  This coffee tastes ok, but it's very weak.  I've tried making it using less than a full cup of water in my Keurig and it is still too weak for my taste.

They are absolutely delicious and we each ordered our favorite flavor on Subscribe & Save and were thrilled with the product and the price.  Unfortunately, these items were discontinued on S&S with no advance notice.  If we had known, we would've stocked up on them.  With the price through the roof as it currently is, we will not be buying them here.

review/summary: Great Product, but these sellers must think we are all stupid!
review/text: The Davinci Gourmet sauces and syrups are fantastic.  I have a DeLonghi Espresso Machine and enjoy a Mocha.  This size, along with the optional pump works great.  Also, the kids love Hot Coco on the weekends, so a pump for my Mocha and a half pump for each of the kids, steam the milk and off we go.  The flavor and consistency of the DaVinci Sauces and flavors of the syrups (I have tried the Peppermint, Raspberry and Hazelnut) are the best, at a fraction of the cost of others.  Every bit as good or better than Starbucks, Ghiradelli, or Monin.<br /><br />HOWEVER, DO NOT BUY IT FROM ANY SELLER ON AMAZON!  Buy it directly from DaVinci Gourmet ({...]).  These people are selling the 64oz. Chocolate Sauce for $14.95 ($3 more than DaVinci) plus $11.95 in shipping ($5 more than DaVinci, unless you buy two (2) in which case the cost of shipping increases to $6.95 from DaVinci).  You will pay $8 more per 1/2 gal than buying it directly from DaVinci, rip-off!  That's more than half of another 64oz. increasing the cost of each coffee significantly, you might as well go to the grocery store and buy Hershey's, half the quality at twice the price, if you enjoy over paying.

review/summary: Tasty Salt!
review/text: I came looking on Amazon to see if I could get a good price for this salt.  We have all thought that it's an excellent tasting salt, currently our favorite, and are glad to know that it has some minerals in it.  I'm leaving this review so others won't be turned away by the only other review to date (one star), which says that they received the salt broken, with a spoon, so I think they might have meant the other pink salt with a similar name which comes with a spoon.  This shipper is Vitacost.  We have ordered from Vitacost for years, including probably 100 items in glass bottles, and have never received a single thing broken; in fact, they go overboard with the bubble wrap.  If someone did receive something broken from Vitacost, it was definitely the rare exception.  In the end:  Tasty salt!

review/summary: Evilly good
review/text: Don't order these. They are pure evil. If you like snappy ginger and a sweet that is different, you can find yourself sadly addicted to these morsels. And they are good quality, too, juicy, sweet, not too stringy.<br /><br />Things you can do with crystallized ginger:<br /><br />1. Use with a marble board and spatula as a mix-in with vanilla ice cream and serve as dessert your next Oriental dinner party. Or mix it in softened ice cream if you don't have one of those marble slabs, it works fine.<br /><br />2. Cover in Belgian couverture chocolate, half dipped, for a sumptuous hostess gift.<br /><br />3. Have them on hand for road trips when Junior has carsickness. Nibbling a bit of this is said to relieve nausea. If Junior will eat them (kids can be funny about ginger.)<br /><br />4. Chop up chunks and put them into biscotti or better yet, shortbread and again, this makes a great hostess gift.<br /><br />5. Hide them, sneak out a piece now and then and nibble surreptiously. Don't share.

review/summary: You'd think they were made in Japan
review/text: I didn't want to buy these when I noticed that they were manufactured in the US (plus, Annie Chun is Korean so I wondered how authentic her Japanese soba would be). However, the price was good so I decided to try them. They're actually fantastic-- good flavor & just the right amount of chewiness. These work well on their own, for yakisoba or soba soup. I can't tell the difference from noodles I used to eat at stand-up soba places in Koriyama.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I agree with the 5-star reviews for this product.  These noodles are excellent tasting, have a good texture and cook up very quickly (4 to 5 min in boiling water).  I have not really bought many soba noodles in the past, so I'm not sure how these US-made noodles compare to authentic Asian soba.<br /><br />It is easy to saute some veggies and make a quick sauce (or use a purchased sauce), for a weeknight meal.  I often cook the whole box then divide in half, making 1/2 as a hot stir-fry dinner and then save the other 1/2 (plain noodles) to use the next day.  I put the left-over noodles in the microwave for a brief time (just to bring them to room temp) then assemble the salad.  Amazingly, the noodles taste fresh and good the next day, possibly better tasting than freshly cooked.  I'm sure they would make a great noodle soup, although I have not tried yet.<br /><br />Ingredients are unbleached enriched wheat flour, buckwheat flour, water, egg whites, salt.  They seem pretty healthy and have a decent amount of fiber, although they are probably not as healthy as a 100% whole wheat pasta, for example.  For the 12 oz box, 6 servings/box, amounts per serving: 200 cal (10 from fat), 3g fiber, 390mg sodium, 8g protein, 10% iron.  Also, great price from Amazon.

review/text: I like these noodles. They cook quickly. The buckwheat gives them a little more flavor than common spaghetti noodles. For a simple one-dish meal, serve some stir-fried meat and vegetables on top of a bed of soba noodles.<br /><br />Just be careful of the price. Similar quality soba noodles cost less than $2 per pound at local grocery stores. Amazon's price is sometimes better, but usually not.

review/summary: I love these noodles
review/text: It took me a couple times to get used to the texture of soba noodles, but I really like them now. At times, we put pasta sauce over them, and eat them like spaghetti. Other times, we eat them just by themselves with some tuna or sardines. They taste great. Buckwheat has a low glycemic index, so they are good for diabetics.

review/text: I like these Soba noodles a lot and the price is definitely the best I've found.  If you're looking for 100 percent buckwheat noodles, though, these are not.
